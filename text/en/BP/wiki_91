<text>The &quot;Lexington&quot;-class aircraft carriers were a pair of aircraft carriers built for the United States Navy (USN) during the 1920s, the and . The ships were built on hulls originally laid down as battlecruisers after World War I, but under the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, all U.S. battleship and battlecruiser construction was cancelled. The Treaty, however, allowed two of the unfinished ships to be converted to carriers. They were the first operational aircraft carriers in the USN and were used to develop carrier aviation tactics and procedures before World War II in a series of annual exercises.

They proved extremely successful as carriers and experience with the &quot;Lexington&quot; class convinced the Navy of the value of large carriers. They were the largest aircraft carriers in the USN until the s were completed beginning in 1945. The ships served in World War II, seeing action in many battles. Although &quot;Lexington&quot; was sunk in the first carrier battle in history (the Battle of the Coral Sea) in 1942, &quot;Saratoga&quot; served throughout the war, despite being torpedoed twice, notably participating in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons in mid-1942 where her aircraft sank the Japanese light carrier . She supported Allied operations in the Indian Ocean and South West Pacific Areas until she became a training ship at the end of 1944. &quot;Saratoga&quot; returned to combat to protect American forces during the Battle of Iwo Jima in early 1945, but was badly damaged by kamikazes. The continued growth in the size and weight of carrier aircraft made her obsolete by the end of the war. In mid-1946, the ship was purposefully sunk during nuclear weapon tests in Operation Crossroads.

==Development==
The &quot;Lexington&quot;-class ships were originally designed to be battlecruisers, with heavy guns, high speed, and moderate armor protection. The Navy laid down six ships of the class in 1919–20. When the battlecruisers were cancelled under the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, two of the unfinished ships were designated for completion as carriers. &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot; were selected since they were the most advanced of the six ships in construction.

Conversion became a series of compromises and mixed blessings which would not have arisen had they been &quot;specifically designed carriers&quot; from the outset. On the plus side, the ships would have better anti-torpedo protection, larger magazines for aircraft bombs and, with the aft elevator higher than otherwise, more room for aircraft landings. On the minus side, a converted battlecruiser would be slower than a specifically designed carrier, have 16 percent less hangar space, less emergency fuel and, with &quot;narrower lines&quot; aft, not as wide a runway for which to aim. Costs were similar. A brand-new aircraft carrier was estimated at $27.1 million. Conversion of a &quot;Lexington&quot; class was $22.4 million, not counting the $6.7 million already sunk into them. Added together, the figure rose to $28.1 million.

The bottom line, with the signing of the treaty, was that any capital ships under construction by the five signatories (the United States, Great Britain, France, Italy and Japan) had to be canceled and scrapped. For battlecruisers, this encompassed the United States″ &quot;Lexington&quot; class, Japan&#x27;s , and Great Britain&#x27;s G3 battlecruisers. For the U.S. Navy, the choice seemed clear. If it scrapped all six &quot;Lexington&quot;s in accordance with the treaty, it would throw away $13.4 million that could otherwise go toward aircraft carriers. The Navy opted for the latter course.

The next challenge the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Construction and Repair faced was the tonnage cap set by the treaty. Carriers were to be no more than 27,000 tons. An exception, spearheaded by Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt Jr. and added to the treaty, allowed capital ships under conversion to go up to 33,000 tons, an increase of 6000 tons. This would almost not be enough for a conversion without removing half the power plant, something the Navy General Board did not consider an option. Creative interpreting of a clause in the treaty allowed a potential way out of this situation. The clause (Chapter II, Part III, Section I, (d)) read:

Without this clause, conversion might not have been feasible. Estimates made in 1928 for the two ships put &quot;Lexington&quot; at an actual tonnage of 35,689 tons and &quot;Saratoga&quot; at 35,544. On official lists, the number given was 33,000 tons, with the footnote, &quot;[this number] does not include weight allowance under Ch. 2, pt. 3, Sec. 1, art. (d) of Washington Treaty for providing means against air and submarine attack&quot;. This tonnage was used by these ships for their entire careers.

==Design and description==

===General description===
The ships had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draft of at deep load. &quot;Saratoga&quot; had a standard displacement of , and at deep load.

One of their innovative features was a relatively new kind of bow called the bulbous bow or Taylor bow, named after its inventor, Rear Admiral David W. Taylor, who served as Chief Constructor for the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Construction and Repair in World War I. The result of a series of towing tests begun in 1910, this bow reduced water resistance by an average of six percent at high speeds, supported the forecastle and reduced bending stress on the hull. A disadvantage was the formation of a thick layer of water, part of the bow wave, which would creep up along the forward side of the hull at higher speeds, although this could be reduced to some degree by careful design of this area.

===Flight deck arrangements===
These ships were given a teak flight deck. Their hangar had a clear height of and encompassed . It was the largest enclosed space afloat, civilian or military, when built. The hangar was long and its width varied from , constrained by the bulky funnel uptakes and boat compartments. The height of the hangar was not exceeded on an American aircraft carrier until the ships appeared in the mid-1950s. Aircraft repair shops, long, were aft of the hangar and below them was a storage space for disassembled aircraft, long. The hangar was divided by a single fire curtain just forward of the aft aircraft elevator.

The carriers were fitted with two hydraulically powered elevators on their centerline. The forward elevator was and had a capacity of . A section of the flight deck adjoining the rear edge of the elevator could split down the centerline to lift aircraft otherwise too long. Carrying , it moved at a speed of . The aft elevator measured and could only lift . Munitions were delivered from the magazines by two hydraulically powered bomb lifts and one torpedo lift. A folding crane with a capacity of was positioned on the flight deck forward of the gun turrets. Aviation gasoline was stored in eight compartments of the torpedo protection system and their capacity has been quoted as either or . A flywheel-powered aircraft catapult, long, was fitted at the bow; it could launch a aircraft at a speed of . It was removed in 1934 as unnecessary.

The &quot;Lexington&quot;-class ships were designed to carry 78 aircraft of various types, including 36 bombers, but these numbers increased once the Navy adopted the practice of tying up spare aircraft in the unused spaces at the top of the hangar. In 1936, her air group consisted of 18 Grumman F2F-1 and 18 Boeing F4B-4 fighters, plus an additional nine F2Fs in reserve. Offensive punch was provided by 20 Vought SBU Corsair dive bombers with 10 spare aircraft and 18 Great Lakes BG torpedo bombers with nine spares. Miscellaneous aircraft included two Grumman JF Duck amphibians, plus one in reserve, and three active and one spare Vought O2U Corsair observation aircraft. This amounted to 79 aircraft, plus 30 spares.

In early December 1941, &quot;Lexington&quot; was ferrying 18 U.S. Marine Corps Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bombers to Midway Atoll and at that time she embarked 65 of her own aircraft, including 17 Brewster F2A Buffalo fighters. During the Wake Island relief expedition later that month, &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s air group consisted of 13 Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters, 42 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers, and 11 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers. The ship also carried 14 Marine Corps Buffalos for delivery at Wake. Before the Battle of the Eastern Solomons in mid-1942, &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s air group consisted of 90 aircraft, comprising 37 Wildcats, 37 Dauntlesses and 16 Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers. In early 1945, the ship carried 53 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters and 17 Avengers.

===Propulsion===
Turbo-electric propulsion had been chosen for the battlecruisers because American companies struggled to produce the very large geared turbines necessary for such big ships and was retained when they were converted into aircraft carriers. One advantage of turbo-electric drive was that the substitution of flexible electric cables for bulky steam-lines allowed the motors to be mounted farther aft; this reduced vibration and weight by shortening the propeller shafts. Another was the ability to go astern at full power without needing a separate reverse turbine to do so, simply by reversing the electrical polarity of the motors. Other benefits were the ability to operate all four propellers if one of the turbo generators failed, and the possibility of operating only some of the generators at low speed with suitably higher loading and greater efficiency. &quot;[Turbo-electric drive] was efficient, rugged and always reliable. But it was also heavy, intricate, and not easy to maintain and keep tuned up.&quot; The machinery also required special ventilation measures to dissipate heat and to keep out any salt air. Even with this and elaborate insulation measures, protection from moisture or from flooding due to battle damage or other causes remained problematic and it posed the danger of high voltage to the crew if damaged.

Each propeller was in diameter and each of the four propeller shafts was powered by two electric motors acting in tandem. These motors were about five times the size of any earlier electric motor. Four General Electric turbo generators powered each propeller shaft and each was rated at , 5000 volts and 4620 amps of direct current (DC). Each of the four AC alternators produced 40,000 kVA. Sixteen water-tube boilers, each in their own individual compartment, provided steam for the generators at a working pressure of and a temperature of . The turbo-electric machinery of the &quot;Lexington&quot;-class ships was designed to produce a total of and propel the ships at , but each ship reached over and in sea trials in 1928. Six DC turbo generators were installed in the upper levels of the two main turbine compartments.

The ships carried a maximum of of fuel oil, but only of that was usable as the rest had to be retained as ballast in the port fuel tanks to offset the weight of the island and main guns. They demonstrated a range of at a speed of with of oil.

===Armament===

The Bureau of Construction and Repair was not then convinced that aircraft could be an effective and sufficient armament for a warship. Thus the design as carriers included a substantial gun battery of eight 8&quot;/55 caliber guns in four twin gun turrets, two pairs of superfiring turrets fore and aft of the island. These turrets were mounted above the flight deck on the starboard side, two before the bridge, and two behind the funnel. The guns in theory could fire to both sides, but it is probable that if they were fired to port (across the deck) the blast would have damaged the flight deck. The guns could be depressed to −5° and elevated to +41°; they were loaded at an angle of +9°. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; this gave a maximum range of .

The &quot;Lexington&quot; class&#x27; anti-aircraft (AA) armament consisted of a dozen 5&quot;/25 caliber guns, six on each side of the ship on single mounts. They had a maximum elevation of +85°. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of . Their maximum range against surface targets was at +30° elevation.

As built, the ships were not fitted with any light AA guns, but a few water-cooled M2 Browning anti-aircraft machine guns were fitted shortly after commissioning and the numbers gradually increased over the 1930s. &quot;Lexington&quot; had 24 of these guns aboard when she was sunk in early 1942. Their projectiles had a muzzle velocity of , but an effective range of only . They had a rate of fire of 550–700 rounds per minute and were exceedingly reliable, however, their projectiles were too light and too short ranged so they were replaced by license-built Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon beginning in 1942. The Oerlikon fired , high-explosive shells at a muzzle velocity of . Its maximum range was although the effective range was under . The cyclic rate of fire was 450 rounds per minute, but the practical rate was between 250 and 320 rounds per minute owing to the need to reload magazines. &quot;Saratoga&quot; mounted 52 of these guns in late 1942.

The Navy had been developing a quadruple 1.1-inch light AA gun since the early 1930s, but it was delayed with teething problems, so five single 3&quot;/50 caliber Mk 10 AA guns were installed in 1940 as temporary replacements. They fired shells at a muzzle velocity of . At +85° elevation they had an anti-aircraft ceiling of .

The Navy made plans to remove the gun turrets in 1940 and replace them with four twin 5&quot;/38 caliber dual-purpose gun turrets (the standard mounting on U.S. battleships and cruisers). At the same time, the 25-caliber guns were to be replaced with more 5&quot;/38 guns on a two for three basis to compensate for their greater weight. The guns fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of fire up to 20 rounds per minute. Against surface targets they had a range of .

Five quadruple 1.1-inch gun mounts were finally fitted aboard the &quot;Lexington&quot;-class ships in late 1941 and early 1942. The projectiles had a muzzle velocity of and an effective range of . The maximum rate of fire was 150 rounds per minute although the frequent need to reload the eight-round magazines reduced that. The gun was not successful in service and it was replaced by the license-built Bofors 40 mm gun beginning in late 1942. The , high-explosive shell was fired at a muzzle velocity of . Its maximum range was although the effective range was around . The cyclic rate of fire was 160 rounds per minute. The guns were fitted in quadruple and twin gun mounts in increasing numbers over the war. &quot;Saratoga&quot; had 23 quadruple and two twin mounts in early 1944.

&quot;Lexington&quot;″s eight-inch gun turrets were removed in early 1942, but they were replaced by seven additional quadruple 1.1-inch gun mounts as a temporary measure. The ship was sunk before her five-inch guns could be replaced and the turrets installed. &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s armament was upgraded in early 1942 while she was under repair after she had been torpedoed. The eight-inch guns and turrets of both ships were reused as coast defense weapons on Oahu.

===Fire control and electronics===
The two superfiring eight-inch turrets had a Mk 30 rangefinder at the rear of the turret for local control, but the guns were normally controlled by two Mk 18 fire-control directors, one each on the fore and aft spotting tops. A rangefinder was fitted on top of the pilothouse to provide range information for the directors. Each group of three 5-inch guns was controlled by a Mk 19 director, two of which were mounted on each side of the spotting tops. Plans were made before the war to replace the obsolete Mk 19 directors with two heavier Mk 33 directors, one each on the fore and aft five-inch spotting tops, but these plans were cancelled when the dual-purpose guns replaced the main armament in early 1942.

&quot;Saratoga&quot; received a RCA CXAM-1 early warning radar in February 1941 during a refit in Bremerton. The antenna was mounted on the forward lip of the funnel with its control room directly below the aerial, replacing the secondary conning station formerly mounted there. She also received two FC (Mk 3) surface fire-control radars in late 1941, although these were both removed along with her main armament in January 1942. The new dual-purpose guns were controlled by two Mk 37 directors, each mounting an FD (Mk 4) anti-aircraft gunnery radar. When the 1.1-inch guns were replaced by 40 mm guns in 1942, the directors for the smaller guns were replaced by five Mk 51 directors. Additional radars were added during 1942 and the ship&#x27;s electronics were modernized during her refit in January 1944.

===Armor===
The waterline belt of the &quot;Lexington&quot;-class ships tapered in thickness from top to bottom and angled 11° outwards at the top. This angle increased the armor&#x27;s relative thickness to horizontal, close-range fire, albeit at the cost of reducing its relative height which increased the chance of plunging shellfire going over or under it. It covered the middle of the ships. Forward, the belt ended in a bulkhead that also tapered from seven to five inches in thickness. Aft, it terminated at a seven-inch bulkhead. This belt had a height of . The third deck over the ships&#x27; machinery and magazine was armored with two layers of special treatment steel (STS) totaling in thickness. The steering gear, however, was protected by two layers of STS that totaled on the flat and on the slope.

The gun turrets were protected only against splinters with of armor. The conning tower was of STS, and it had a communications tube with two-inch sides ran from the conning tower down to the lower conning position on the third deck. The torpedo defense system of the &quot;Lexington&quot;-class ships consisted of three to six medium steel protective bulkheads that ranged from in thickness. The spaces between them could be left empty or used as fuel tanks to absorb the detonation of a torpedo&#x27;s warhead.

==Service==

&quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot; were used to develop and refine carrier tactics in a series of annual exercises before World War II. On more than one occasion these included successfully staged surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. &quot;Lexington&quot;″s turbo-electric propulsion system allowed her to supplement the electrical supply of Tacoma, Washington, in a drought from late 1929 to early 1930. She also delivered medical personnel and relief supplies to Managua, Nicaragua, after an earthquake in 1931.

Both ships were assigned to the Pacific Fleet and were based at Pearl Harbor in December 1941, although, at the time of the Japanese attack, neither of them were in port. &quot;Lexington&quot; was at sea ferrying fighter aircraft to Midway Island. Her mission was cancelled and she returned to Pearl Harbor a week later. &quot;Saratoga&quot; had completed a major refit at Bremerton, and, following work up, had arrived in San Diego to embark her air group. &quot;Saratoga&quot; immediately sailed for Hawaii as the flagship of Carrier Division One, arriving on 15 December.

A few days after &quot;Lexington&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor from her aborted mission to Midway, she was sent to create a diversion from the force en route to relieve the besieged Wake Island garrison by attacking Japanese installations in the Marshall Islands. The island was forced to surrender before the relief force got close enough, and the mission was cancelled. A planned attack on Wake Island in January 1942 had to be cancelled when a submarine sank the oiler required to supply the fuel for the return trip. &quot;Lexington&quot; was sent to the Coral Sea the following month to block any Japanese advances into the area. The ship was spotted by Japanese search aircraft while approaching Rabaul, New Britain, and her aircraft shot down most of the Japanese bombers that attacked her. Together with the carrier , she successfully attacked Japanese shipping off the east coast of New Guinea in early March.

&quot;Lexington&quot; was briefly refitted in Pearl Harbor at the end of the month and rendezvoused with &quot;Yorktown&quot; in the Coral Sea in early May. A few days later the Japanese began Operation MO, the invasion of Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, and the two American carriers attempted to stop the invasion forces. They sank the light aircraft carrier on 7 May in the Battle of the Coral Sea, but did not encounter the main Japanese force of the carriers and until the next day. Aircraft from &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot; succeeded in badly damaging &quot;Shōkaku&quot;, but the Japanese aircraft crippled &quot;Lexington&quot;. Vapors from leaking aviation gasoline tanks sparked a series of explosions and fires that could not be controlled, and the carrier had to be scuttled by an American destroyer on the evening of 8 May to prevent her capture.

Shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Saratoga&quot; was the centerpiece of the unsuccessful American effort to relieve Wake Island and was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine a few weeks later. After lengthy repairs, the ship supported forces participating in the Guadalcanal Campaign and her aircraft sank the light carrier in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons in August 1942. She was again torpedoed the following month and returned to the Solomon Islands area after repairs were completed.

In 1943, &quot;Saratoga&quot; supported Allied forces involved in the New Georgia Campaign and invasion of Bougainville in the northern Solomon Islands and her aircraft twice attacked the Japanese base at Rabaul in November. Early in 1944, her aircraft provided air support in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands Campaign before she was transferred to the Indian Ocean for several months to support the Royal Navy&#x27;s Eastern Fleet as it attacked targets in Java and Sumatra. After a brief refit in mid-1944, the ship became a training ship for the rest of the year.

In early 1945, &quot;Saratoga&quot; participated in the Battle of Iwo Jima as a dedicated night fighter carrier. Several days into the battle, she was badly damaged by kamikaze hits and was forced to return to the United States for repairs. While under repair, the ship, now increasingly obsolete, was permanently modified as a training carrier with some of her hangar deck converted into classrooms. &quot;Saratoga&quot; remained in this role for the rest of the war and was used to ferry troops back to the United States after the Japanese surrender in August. In July 1946, she was used as a target for atomic bomb tests in Operation Crossroads, and sank at Bikini Atoll. Her wreck is easily accessible to scuba divers and organized dive tours are available.

<doc id="485202" wikidata="Q743095" url="?curid=485202" title="Creoda of Mercia">
<text>Creoda (Cryda or Crida, 6th century) may have been one of the first kings of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia, ruling toward the end of the 6th century.

Although he is mentioned in a pedigree found in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, Creoda is not given the title of king. His existence is disputed by some scholars. Barbara Yorke wrote: &quot;Although it is possible that some kind of regnal list could be the source of the information (though the Worcester lists begin with Penda), these entries could be nothing more than intelligent guesswork based on names derived from Bede and the genealogy of Æthelred, while the dates seem to be influenced by an entry in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the death of a West Saxon Creoda...The surviving sources allow us to say with confidence little more than that the kingdom of Mercia was in existence by the end of the sixth century.&quot;

Yorke&#x27;s sentiment is shared by Professor of Medieval History Nicholas Brooks, who wrote: &quot;Despite Professor Davies&#x27;s tentative advocacy of the historicity of this material, it cannot be said that it is yet clear that what lies behind these scattered entries in the works of Henry of Huntingdon, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris is anything more important than some inventive conjectures by an English monk, perhaps as late as the early twelfth century, on the basis of the names available in Bede, the Mercian royal genealogy and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. On such an interpretation it would not be surprising that they should more or less fit the fragments of information that we have on the early history of Mercia; for the compiler of these entries may have had access to the same sources as are available to us.&quot;

The suggestion that Creoda was a king of Mercia is to be found in the &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot;, which was written by Henry of Huntingdon in the first half of the 12th century. Creoda&#x27;s presumed death was reported by Henry of Huntingdon as occurring in 593, but appears to be based on a confusion, because in that year the death of a man called Crida is specified, but the context suggests that the dying man was West Saxon and not Mercian.

Creoda is recorded by the Mercian pedigree in the &quot;Anglian collection&quot; as having been the son of Cynewald and the great-grandson of Icel, the eponymous ancestor of his family, the Iclingas.

<text>USS &quot;Virginia&quot; (SSN-774) is a nuclear powered cruise missile attack submarine and the lead ship of her class, currently serving in the United States Navy (USN). She is the tenth vessel of the Navy to be named for the Commonwealth of Virginia, as well as the second US Navy attack submarine to be named after a state, a pattern that is common throughout her class.
==History==
The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 30 September 1998 and her keel was laid down on 2 September 1999. She was launched on 16 August 2003 sponsored by Lynda Johnson Robb, the wife of former Virginia governor and senator Charles Robb, and daughter of President of the United States Lyndon B. Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson. She was the first U.S. Navy submarine to be completely designed on a computer. On 10 and 11 March, the prospective submarine shot 12 dummy torpedoes into the Thames River, Connecticut, from each of the boat&#x27;s four tubes.

&quot;Virginia&quot; was delivered to the Navy on 12 October 2004, the 104th anniversary of the commissioning of &quot;Holland&quot;, the Navy&#x27;s first modern, commissioned submarine. She was commissioned on 23 October 2004 under the command of David J. Kern. The commissioning ceremony was featured in the 2005 television series &quot;Submarine: Hidden Hunter&quot; on Discovery Channel. This class of submarine is unique in that it features a photonics mast that freed ship designers to place the boat&#x27;s control room in a lower, less geometrically constrained space than would be required by a standard, optical tube periscope. It is additionally unique in the U.S. Navy for featuring all-digital ship and ballast control systems that are operated by relatively senior watchstanders and a pressure chamber to deploy SEALs, divers or other special forces units while being submerged.

On 23 November 2005, &quot;Virginia&quot; completed her first deployment in support of the Global War on Terrorism. On 12 January 2006, &quot;Virginia&quot; entered Electric Boat&#x27;s shipyard for post-shakedown availability, which was expected to last for most of 2006. In April 2010 the submarine returned from a six-month deployment having covered 37,000 miles.

The submarine completed her first 20-month-long overhaul in May 2012.

On 13 November 2024, &quot;Virginia&quot; accidentally sailed into the nets of &quot;Øygutt&quot;, a fishing vessel, near the island of Senja, Norway. The &quot;Øygutt&quot; was fishing for halibut at the time of the incident. The &quot;Virginia&quot; was able to successfully free itself without further damage to the submarine.

== Ship&#x27;s crest ==

&quot;Emblazoned on a blue background that symbolizes the mighty deep, &quot;Virginia&quot; is prominently positioned. The forward view of &quot;Virginia&quot; denotes her leading the submarine force into a new century and onto a new and exciting course for the United States Navy. The gold lettering and border around the seal combined with the blue background represent the Navy&#x27;s colors of blue and gold. The silhouette of the Commonwealth of Virginia represents the state for which the boat is named. Each of the nine stars represents an American warship named &quot;Virginia&quot;. The single point of light at the stern of the boat symbolizes both the nuclear propulsion plant that powers the submarine as well as the boat&#x27;s data processing system fiber optic backbone. In keeping with the Commonwealth of Virginia&#x27;s motto, the words &quot;Sic Semper Tyrannis&quot; (Latin for &quot;Thus Always To Tyrants&quot;) appear at the bottom, which combined with the symbolism of the Commonwealth&#x27;s Seal, represents the triumph of Virtue over tyranny.

The image of George Washington also looks forward with &quot;Virginia&quot;. George Washington, a Virginia native, has been characterized as the &quot;indispensable man&quot; vital to the formation of the American republic. In all of history, few men who possessed unassailable power have used that power so selflessly and wisely for the welfare of their countrymen and all mankind. &quot;Virginia&quot; also stands ready in all her indisputable power to serve the people of America and her allies.&quot;

==Commemorative works==
The Navy League of the United States commissioned Tom Liesegang to commemorate the USS &quot;Virginia&quot; in 2004. A print, depicting the submarine on her sea trials, is layered with copies of the (1862) line drawings obtained from the Mariners&#x27; Museum. Ten prints were created for contractors and sponsors, including: Senator John Warner, Admiral Edmund Giambastiani and Lynda Bird Johnson Robb, the daughter of President Lyndon Johnson.

<doc id="485206" wikidata="Q281115" url="?curid=485206" title="Proteus syndrome">
<text>Proteus syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that can cause tissue overgrowth involving all three embryonic lineages. Patients with Proteus syndrome tend to have an increased risk of embryonic tumor development. The clinical symptoms and radiographic findings of Proteus syndrome are highly variable, as are its orthopedic manifestations.

Only a few more than 200 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with estimates that about 120 people are currently alive with the condition. As attenuated forms of the disease may exist, there could be many people with Proteus syndrome who remain undiagnosed. Those most readily diagnosed are also the most severely disfigured.

The syndrome is named after the Greek sea god Proteus, who could change his shape. The condition appears to have been first described in the American medical literature by Samia Temtamy and John Rogers in 1976. American pathologist Michael Cohen described it in 1979.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Proteus syndrome causes an overgrowth of skin, bones, muscles, fatty tissues, and blood and lymphatic vessels. Proteus syndrome is a progressive condition wherein children are usually born without any obvious deformities. Tumors of skin and bone growths appear as they age typically in early childhood. The musculoskeletal manifestations are cardinal for the diagnosis of Proteus syndrome. The severity and locations of these asymmetrical growths vary greatly but typically the skull, one or more limbs, and soles of the feet will be affected. There is a risk of premature death in affected individuals due to deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism caused by the vessel malformations that are associated with this disorder. Because of carrying excess weight and enlarged limbs, arthritis and muscle pain may also be symptoms. Further risks may occur due to the mass of extra tissue.

The disorder does not uniformly cause learning impairments: the distribution of intelligence deficits among those with Proteus syndrome appears higher than that of the general population. This is difficult to determine with statistical significance. In addition, the presence of visible deformity hurt the social experiences of the affected individual, causing emotional difficulties, social rejection and stigma.

Affected individuals are at increased risk for developing certain tumors including unilateral ovarian cystadenomas, testicular tumors, meningiomas, and monomorphic adenomas of the parotid gland.

Hemimegalencephaly is often found to be associated.

===Orthopaedic features===
The musculoskeletal manifestations of Proteus syndrome are frequent and recognizable. Patients tend to demonstrate a unique pattern of skeletal abnormalities. The orthopaedic features are usually bilateral, asymmetrical, and progressive, and involve all four limbs and the spine. Affected patients usually have localized periarticular limb distortions, limb length discrepancy, and spine deformity. Patients with Proteus syndrome can have regular bone configuration and contours despite the bone enlargement. Patients can also exhibit deformation of the skull in the form of dolichocephaly or elongated skull and facial abnormalities. Because of the rarity of the syndrome and the variability of signs, orthopaedic management should be individualized.

== Genetics ==

In 2011 researchers determined the cause of Proteus syndrome. In 26 of 29 patients who met strict clinical criteria for the disorder, Lindhurst &quot;et al.&quot; identified an activating mutation in AKT1 kinase in a mosaic state.

Previous research had suggested the condition linked to &quot;PTEN&quot; on chromosome 10, while other research pointed to chromosome 16. Before the findings regarding &quot;AKT1&quot; in 2011, other researchers expressed doubt regarding the involvement of &quot;PTEN&quot; or &quot;GPC3&quot;, which codes for glypican 3 and may play a role in regulating cell division and growth regulation.

==Diagnosis==
===Differential diagnosis===
* Macrodystrophia lipomatosa
* Fibrolipomatous hamartoma
* Neurofibromatosis type 1
* Klippel–Trénaunay syndrome
* Parkes Weber syndrome
* Sotos syndrome
* Hemangiomas

=== Classification ===
Many sources classify Proteus syndrome as a type of nevus syndrome. The lesions appear to be distributed in a mosaic manner. It has been confirmed that the disorder is an example of genetic mosaicism.

== Treatment ==
A team of doctors in Australia has trial-tested the drug rapamycin in the treatment of a patient said to have Proteus syndrome and have found it to be an effective remedy. However, the diagnosis of Proteus syndrome in this patient has been questioned by others.

The Arqule Corporation developed the AKT1 inhibitor ARQ 092, which is being tested by a research team in the National Human Genome Research Institute at the United States National Institutes of Health in a Phase 0 dose-finding trial. In earlier tests on tissue and cell samples obtained from patients, ARQ 092 reduced phosphorylation of AKT and downstream targets of AKT in as little as two hours. The Phase 0 trial opened in November 2015. This trial is based on in vitro data showing inhibition of AKT1 in cell lines from patients with Proteus syndrome.

== Notable cases ==
In a 1986 article in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;, Michael Cohen and J.A.R. Tibbles proposed the idea that Joseph Merrick (an Englishman known as the &quot;Elephant Man&quot;) had Proteus syndrome. However, the exact condition that Joseph Merrick had is still not known with certainty.

Mandy Sellars has been diagnosed by some doctors as having this condition. Her legs and feet have grown disproportionately since birth. However, in 2013, Sellars&#x27;s case was profiled on British television in a special called &quot;Shrinking My 17 Stone Legs&quot;, in which it was determined that Sellars&#x27;s condition was not, in fact, Proteus syndrome, but rather the often-misdiagnosed PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum, a syndrome caused by a PIK3CA gene mutation.

<doc id="485209" wikidata="Q2297167" url="?curid=485209" title="USS North Carolina (SSN-777)">
<text>USS &quot;North Carolina&quot; (SSN-777), a attack submarine, is the fourth vessel of the United States Navy named for U.S. state of
North Carolina. The contract to build her was awarded to Northrop Grumman Newport News on 30 September 1998 and her keel was laid down on 24 May 2004. She was launched on 5 May 2007. &quot;North Carolina&quot; was commissioned on 3 May 2008 in Wilmington, North Carolina.

This class of submarine is unique in that it features the Photonics Mast Program (PMP) that freed ship designers to place the boat&#x27;s control room in a lower, less geometrically constrained space than would be required by a standard, optical tube periscope. It is additionally unique in the U.S. Navy for featuring all-digital ship and ballast control systems that are operated by relatively senior watchstanders and a pressure chamber to deploy SEAL divers while being submerged. She is capable of diverse missions, including conventional submarine warfare, strike warfare, mining operations, and delivery of special operations personnel and equipment.

==History==
The contract to build her was awarded to Northrop Grumman Newport News (then called Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Company) in Newport News, Virginia on 30 September 1998 and her keel was laid down on 22 May 2004. She was christened on 21 April 2007 sponsored by Linda Bowman, wife of Admiral Frank L. &quot;Skip&quot; Bowman, former director of Naval Reactors.

The boat has physical connections to previous ships named &quot;North Carolina&quot;. Sections of the teak decking from , a fast battleship that served in World War II, are reused within the submarine, and several pieces from a silver serving set made for , a World War I-era armored cruiser, transferred through the state governor to the battleship will be used aboard the submarine.

&quot;North Carolina&quot; joined the fleet on 21 February 2008, after problems with the boat&#x27;s steam valve and internal piping system had forced two delays in the acceptance of the vessel. Welding issues in the internal piping system scuttled a first-planned December 2007 delivery, and the discovery of an inadequate steam valve forced a further delay from January to February 2008.

The ship&#x27;s official commissioning ceremony was held on 3 May 2008, in Wilmington, North Carolina. The submarine joined the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Atlantic Fleet based in New London, Connecticut.

In 2010, &quot;North Carolina&quot; changed homeports from Naval Submarine Base New London to Naval Station Pearl Harbor. She left Groton for Pearl Harbor on 22 July 2010 and arrived at her new homeport, Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam, on Monday, 15 November 2010 after her four-month transfer activities. During the transfer, the officers and crew of &quot;North Carolina&quot; conducted a series of exercises designed to test the boat&#x27;s new combat systems and stealth capabilities. &quot;North Carolina&quot; is the third &quot;Virginia&quot;-class attack submarine to be homeported at Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam and is assigned to Commander, Submarine Squadron 1.

<doc id="485210" wikidata="Q634024" url="?curid=485210" title="Yorktown-class aircraft carrier">
<text>The &quot;Yorktown&quot; class was a class of three aircraft carriers built for the United States Navy and completed shortly before World War II, the , , and . They immediately followed , the first U.S. aircraft carrier built as such, and benefited in design from experience with &quot;Ranger&quot; and the earlier , which were conversions into carriers of two battlecruisers that were to be scrapped to comply with the Washington Naval Treaty, an arms limitation accord.

These ships bore the brunt of the fighting in the Pacific during 1942, and two of the three were lost: &quot;Yorktown&quot;, sunk at the Battle of Midway, and &quot;Hornet&quot;, sunk in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands.

&quot;Enterprise&quot;, the sole survivor of the class, was the most decorated ship of the U.S. Navy in the Second World War. After efforts to save her as a museum ship failed, she was scrapped in 1958.

==Development==

In an early example of modern weapons development, the &quot;Yorktown&quot; class was a result of standardized war gaming exercises using and the Newport Naval War College. Analysis of the results, combined with lessons learned from operations with the large converted battlecruiser &quot;Lexington&quot;-class in comparison with the smaller purpose-built &quot;Ranger&quot;, highlighted the greater flexibility presented by large air groups and fast ships. These became, along with torpedo protection, the guiding principles in the &quot;Yorktown&quot; class designs.

With the commissioning of USS &quot;Ranger&quot;, the USN had 54,400 tons of carrier construction left under the Washington Treaty. Initially, the development plan for the class envisioned a 17,000-ton design that would allow the Navy to build three ships and stay within the 135,000-ton Washington Naval Treaty limit on aircraft carrier tonnage. However, this design could not achieve the desired high operating speed without sacrificing protection features and air wing capacity. In addition, the London Treaty of 1930 required that the USS &quot;Langley&quot; be added into the tonnage limits, no longer being classified as an &quot;experimental&quot; carrier. In the end, the Navy chose instead to build two 19,000-ton carriers that could fulfill the design vision; though smaller in displacement than the USS &quot;Lexington&quot; class and a nominal 27,000-ton limit design, the ships retained high-powered machinery, hull volume and flight deck area that allowed for a fast and capacious design, but also improved durability and provided close to an all-weather ability to launch aircraft. These were versatile carriers that could carry and operate over 80 aircraft, almost as many as the much larger &quot;Lexington&quot; class.
Plans initially called for a flush deck with no island. However, the Royal Navy had constructed several flush-deck carriers, and the problems encountered in those designs were known to the US Navy; the US naval attaché in Britain, J.C. Hunsacker, reported that had problems exhausting boiler smoke without proper smoke stacks. In addition to the engineering constraints, it was becoming evident that larger air groups and antiaircraft batteries would be easier to command from an island design. In the end BuAer retracted all demands for flush decked carriers.

Conversion of USS &quot;Langley&quot; into a seaplane tender allowed the Navy to fill in the remaining available treaty tonnage with a scaled-down version of the class, which became the 14,700-ton . Service experience validated the advantages of the larger hull design. USS &quot;Ranger&quot; proved to be unable to withstand rougher weather in the Pacific, while lack of virtually any protective features soon relegated her to a training ship. USS &quot;Wasp&quot;″s lack of torpedo protection contributed to her loss in the Pacific theater.

The abandonment of the arms limitation treaties system in 1937 allowed the US to begin building more carriers, and the first of this new carrier program was &quot;Hornet&quot;, another of the class, commissioned in 1941. Improvements to the &quot;Yorktown&quot; design and freedom from the Washington Treaty limitations brought about the s.

The &quot;Yorktown&quot;s carried a seldom-used catapult on the hangar deck. This catapult was subsequently eliminated from U.S. carriers as it was relatively useless in operation. The hangar-deck catapult was removed from &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot; in late June 1942.

All three ships of the &quot;Yorktown&quot; class were built at the Newport News Shipbuilding Company, Newport News, Virginia.

==Ships in class==
==Operational history==
The three ships of this class are noted for bearing the brunt of the fighting in the early months of the Pacific War, most notably during the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Battle of Midway, and the Guadalcanal campaign. During the latter campaign, &quot;Hornet&quot; and later &quot;Enterprise&quot; had the distinction of being the only operational carrier in the United States Pacific Fleet.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; was at sea on the morning of 7 December 1941 (the day of the Attack on Pearl Harbor). That evening, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, screened by six of her Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters, put into Pearl Harbor for fuel and supplies. The aircraft were fired on by anti-aircraft defenses, and one pilot radioed in, reporting that his aircraft was an American aircraft. &quot;Enterprise&quot; later participated in the first offensive actions against Japan, launching attacks against the Marshall Islands, Wake, and Marcus Island.

&quot;Yorktown&quot; transferred to the Pacific on 16 December 1941 and later raided the Gilbert Islands in the same operation as &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Along with , she raided bases in New Guinea, then participated in the Battle of the Coral Sea. Her planes helped sink the and damaged the carrier . Damaged by Japanese carrier aircraft, &quot;Yorktown&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor and was hastily repaired in time to participate in the Battle of Midway.

&quot;Hornet&quot; spent the first months of the war training in Norfolk, Virginia, before being assigned to the Doolittle Raid. Loaded with a squadron of B-25 bombers and escorted by &quot;Enterprise&quot;, the ship launched the first air raids against the Japanese mainland.

All three ships of the class saw action during the Battle of Midway (4–7 June 1942), &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot; aircraft were responsible for sinking all four Japanese carriers engaged in the battle, while &quot;Hornet&quot; assisted in the sinking of one heavy cruiser and severely damaging another. All three carriers suffered severe losses among their air groups, most notably &quot;Hornet&quot;″s Torpedo Squadron 8, which lost 15 aircraft with only a single surviving airman. &quot;Yorktown&quot; was damaged by aerial bombs and torpedoes and abandoned on 4 June. Later re-manned by repair crews, the ship was spotted and torpedoed by a Japanese submarine and eventually sank on 7 June 1942.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; was assigned to the invasion of Guadalcanal and participated in preliminary strikes on the island. She suffered moderate damage during the Battle of the Eastern Solomons but was repaired in time to join &quot;Hornet&quot; in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. &quot;Hornet&quot; was severely damaged during the latter engagement and had to be abandoned. Attempts to scuttle the ship by her escorts failed, and she was left adrift before finally being sunk by Japanese destroyers on 27 October 1942. &quot;Enterprise&quot; was again damaged during the battle, but was repaired enough to deliver her air group to Guadalcanal, where it participated in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. &quot;Enterprise&quot; aircraft assisted in finishing off the heavily damaged battleship and were instrumental in destroying the Japanese transport fleet, thereby ending Japan&#x27;s last serious attempt at reclaiming the island.

After a lengthy overhaul and repair period at Bremerton, Washington, &quot;Enterprise&quot; joined the Central Pacific Fleet as part of the Fast Carrier Task Force. She participated in every major invasion of the Central Pacific campaign, including the Battle of the Philippine Sea and the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Her air groups contributed to the development of carrier night operations, executing a night air raid on Truk Lagoon and operating as a specialized night air group towards the end of the war.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; was finally put out of action on 14 May 1945 when she was struck in the forward elevator by a &quot;kamikaze&quot; aircraft flown by Japanese pilot Lt. Shunsuke Tomiyasu, which destroyed the elevator and severely damaged her hangar deck. She was still out of action on V-J Day but was subsequently fitted out for Operation Magic Carpet, ferrying over 10,000 veterans home from Europe.

By the end of World War II, &quot;Enterprise&quot; had been considerably modified. Her final displacement was 32,060 tons and her final armament was 8 single 5-inch/38 caliber DP guns, 40 40 mm Bofors AA guns, 6 quad and 8 twin (replacing the ineffective 1.1&quot;/75 caliber gun quad mounts which the &quot;Yorktown&quot; class had initially been fitted with) and 50 single 20 mm Oerlikon AA cannons. The &quot;Yorktown&quot;s had proved to be vulnerable to torpedoes, and while undergoing repairs at Bremerton, Washington, from July to October, 1943, &quot;Enterprise&quot; received an extensive refit, which included an anti-torpedo blister that significantly improved her underwater protection.

With the commissioning of the more advanced &quot;Essex&quot; and carriers, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was surplus for post war needs. She entered New York Naval Shipyard on 18 January 1946 for deactivation, and was decommissioned on 17 February 1947. Stricken from the list in 1959 after multiple attempts to preserve her as a museum and memorial, ex-&quot;Enterprise&quot; met her fate in the breaker&#x27;s yards at Kearny, New Jersey, in 1960, although several artifacts were retained.

<doc id="485211" wikidata="Q4919014" url="?curid=485211" title="Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge">
<text>Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge is a United States National Wildlife Refuge located in two separate sections in central Chaves County, New Mexico, United States, a few miles northeast of the city of Roswell. Both sections lie on the banks of the Pecos River. The refuge was established in 1937 to provide habitat for migratory birds such as the sandhill crane and the snow goose, but it is also notable for rare native fish and the over 90 species of dragonflies and damselflies that inhabit the refuge.

Where the Chihuahuan Desert meets the Southern Plains, Bitter Lake is one of the most biologically significant wetland areas of the Pecos River basin. The Bitter Lake Group of lake and wetlands within the National Wildlife Refuge was listed as a National Natural Landmark in 1980.

==Aquatic habitats==
Bitter Lake includes various unique aquatic habitats. The Pecos River flows across the refuge and forms oxbow lakes. Additionally, the Roswell aquifer underlies the area. Erosion of gypsum by this underground water has caused many sinkholes, some of which have become very deep lakes that are home to unique species. Underground water also feeds springs that are the source of water for the lakes on the refuge. The water level in these lakes is managed by park personnel and is adjusted throughout the year to accommodate the different species of birds that migrate to the refuge.

==Dragonflies==
Bitter Lake hosts a diverse population of over 90 species of dragonflies and damselfiles. There is a special viewing area along the auto tour route, however, dragonflies can be seen throughout the refuge. The peak dragonfly population occurs in July and August. The park hosts an annual dragonfly festival in September.

==Birds==
Bitter Lake is especially known as a refuge for birds. There are at least 350 species of birds that have been recorded on the refuge. Bird activity varies year-round with Bitter Lake serving as a refuge for migrating species. Songbirds can be seen in the spring, especially May. In the summer months the refuge is home to many marsh and shorebirds. In the fall there are raptor migrations. Waterfowl concentrations rise in the winter. While some species such as the sandhill crane can number in the thousands, others have been spotted only on rare occasions.

<doc id="485214" wikidata="Q1053355" url="?curid=485214" title="Midway-class aircraft carrier">
<text>The &quot;Midway&quot; class was a class of three United States Navy aircraft carriers. The lead ship, , was commissioned in September 1945 and decommissioned in 1992. was commissioned in October 1945, and taken out of service in 1977. was commissioned in April 1947, and decommissioned in 1990.

==History==
===1940s===
The CVB-41-class vessels (then unnamed) were originally conceived in 1940 as a design study to determine the effect of including an armored flight deck on a carrier the size of the . The resulting calculations showed that the effect would be a reduction of air group size—the resulting ship would have an air group of 64, compared to 90–100 for the standard &quot;Essex&quot;-class fleet carriers. As it progressed, the design also became heavily influenced by the wartime experience of the Royal Navy&#x27;s armored carriers:
The concept went to finding a larger carrier that could support both deck armor and a sufficiently large air group. The weight-savings needed to armor the flight deck were achieved by removing the planned cruiser-caliber battery of guns and reducing the 5-inch antiaircraft battery from dual to single mounts. Unlike the Royal Navy&#x27;s aircraft carriers, for which the armored deck was part of the ship structure, the &quot;Midway&quot; class retained their &quot;strength deck&quot; at the hangar deck level and the armored flight deck was part of the superstructure. They would be the last USN carriers to be so designed; the immense size of the succeeding supercarriers would require a new deep-hulled design carrying the strength deck at the flight deck level to produce a stronger and lighter hull.

The heavily subdivided arrangement of the machinery spaces was based on that of the , while the two inner propeller shafts were partially enclosed in skegs, similar to contemporary battleship construction. While the &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers had eight main engineering compartments, the &quot;Midway&quot;-class had 26, including twelve boiler rooms well off the centerline and four widely separated engine rooms. More extensive use of electric arc-welding than in previous warships reduced the weight by about 10 percent of what would have been required for riveted structural assembly.

The resulting &quot;Midway&quot;-class carriers were very large, with the ability to accommodate more planes than any other carrier in the U.S. fleet (30–40 more aircraft than the &quot;Essex&quot; class). In their original configuration, the &quot;Midway&quot;-class ships had an airwing of up to 130 aircraft. It was soon realized that the coordination of so many planes was beyond the effective command and control ability of one ship. However, their size did allow these ships to more easily accommodate the rapid growth in aircraft size and weight that took place in the early jet age. The forward flight deck was designed for launching 13-ton aircraft; and the aft flight deck was designed for landing 11-ton aircraft, assuming in-flight expenditure of fuel and ordnance.

While the resulting ships featured excellent protection and unprecedented airwing size, they also had several undesirable characteristics. Internally, the ships were very cramped and crowded. Freeboard was unusually low for such large carriers; in heavy seas, they shipped large amounts of water (only partially mitigated by the fitting of a hurricane bow during the SCB-110/110A upgrades) and corkscrewed in a manner that hampered landing operations. The follow-up &quot;Forrestal&quot;-class featured a deeper hull that had more freeboard and better seakeeping.

In contrast with the earlier , and -classes, the beam (width) of the &quot;Midway&quot;-class carriers meant that they could not pass through the Panama Canal.

Although they were intended to augment the US Pacific fleet during World War II, the lead ship of the class, , was not commissioned until 10 September 1945, eight days after the surrender of Japan.

While &quot;Midway&quot; and &quot;Coral Sea&quot; followed the US Navy&#x27;s policy of naming aircraft carriers after battles (two s gave up their names for the larger ships), USS &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; inaugurated the policy of naming aircraft carriers after former US Presidents that the US Navy generally follows today.

===1950s===
None of the class went on war cruises during the Korean War. As the three ships became essential to the Navy&#x27;s strategic nuclear weapons role in Europe, they were mainly deployed to the Atlantic and Mediterranean. Until the availability of the &quot;Forrestal&quot; class, they were the premier commands sought by senior naval aviators. They were &quot;admiral makers&quot; for many of their commanding officers including future Chief of Naval Operations George Whelan Anderson Jr. and David L. McDonald.

During the 1950s, &quot;Midway&quot; and &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; underwent the SCB-110 modernization program (similar to SCB-125 for the &quot;Essex&quot; class), which added angled flight decks, steam catapults, mirror landing systems, and other modifications that allowed them to operate a new generation of larger and heavier naval aircraft. &quot;Coral Sea&quot; had a variant modernization program called SCB-110A with an angled deck 3 degrees greater than the other two.

===1960s===
All three of the &quot;Midway&quot; class made combat deployments in the Vietnam War. deployed to the Gulf of Tonkin six times, deployed on three occasions, and made one combat deployment before returning to the Mediterranean.

In the late 1960s, &quot;Midway&quot; underwent an extensive modernization and reconstruction program under SCB 101.66, which proved to be controversial and expensive and thus was not repeated on the other ships. While $82 million had been budgeted for the modernization, the actual cost was $202 million, in comparison to $277 million for simultaneous construction of the brand-new .

&quot;Roosevelt&quot; instead received an austere $46 million refit (SCB 103.68), enabling her to operate the Grumman A-6 Intruder and LTV A-7 Corsair II. In July 1968, &quot;Roosevelt&quot; entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard for her 11-month modernization program. The forward centerline elevator was relocated to the starboard deck edge forward of the island, the port waist catapult was removed, the crew spaces were refurbished, and all of the four remaining anti-aircraft turrets were removed. The Roosevelt set sail with 4 - 5&quot; guns, 2 on either side controlled by 3 Mk 56 Gunfire control systems and one Mk 37 System. &quot;Roosevelt&quot; also received a deck edge spray system using the new seawater compatible fire-fighting chemical, Light Water. She put to sea again on 26 May 1969.

===1970s===
By the 1970s, &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; and &quot;Coral Sea&quot; were showing their age. All three retained the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II in their air wings, being too small to operate the new Grumman F-14 Tomcat fleet defense fighter or the S-3 Viking anti-submarine jet. In 1977, &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; was decommissioned as she was the least modernized and in poor condition compared to the others in her class. On her final deployment, &quot;Roosevelt&quot; embarked AV-8 Harrier jump jets to test the concept of including VSTOL aircraft in a carrier air wing.
===1980s===
&quot;Coral Sea&quot; was rescued from imminent decommissioning by the election of Ronald Reagan as president of the United States in 1980. Reagan&#x27;s proposed 600-ship Navy gave the remaining ships a new lease on life. &quot;Coral Sea&quot; underwent extensive refits to address the ship&#x27;s poor condition. When the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet became operational in the mid-1980s, the Navy quickly deployed them to the &quot;Midway&quot; and &quot;Coral Sea&quot; to replace the older F-4s. On 15 April 1986, aircraft from &quot;Coral Sea&quot;, as well as USAF F-111Fs from RAF Lakenheath in the UK, struck targets in Libya as part of &quot;Operation El Dorado Canyon&quot;. The Hornets went into action for the first time, flying several ship-to-shore air strikes against Libyan shore installations that were harassing the fleet. During this action, the Hornets from &quot;Coral Sea&quot; attacked and destroyed the SA-5 missile site at Sirte which had been &quot;painting&quot; US aircraft with its radars. This was the combat debut for the Hornet, and incidentally marked the first combat use of the AGM-88 HARM anti-radiation missile. The Hornets attacked the SAM sites in bad weather and at wave top heights. All of them returned without mishap.

A 1986 refit for &quot;Midway&quot; removed her 6&quot; armor belt and bulged her hull to try to increase freeboard. While successful in this regard, the bulges also resulted in a dangerously fast rolling period that prevented &quot;Midway&quot; from operating aircraft in heavy seas. The bulging was therefore not repeated on &quot;Coral Sea&quot;.

===1990s===
The Reagan era reprieve could not last. In 1990, &quot;Coral Sea&quot;, which had long since earned the nickname &quot;Ageless Warrior&quot;, was decommissioned. &quot;Midway&quot; had one last war in which to participate, and was one of the six aircraft carriers deployed by the U.S. against Iraq during Operation Desert Storm. A few months after the campaign, &quot;Midway&quot; was decommissioned.

&quot;Coral Sea&quot; was slowly scrapped at Baltimore as legal and environmental troubles continually delayed her fate. &quot;Midway&quot; spent five years in the mothball fleet at Bremerton, Washington before being taken over by a museum group. The ship is now open to the public at the USS &quot;Midway&quot; Museum in San Diego, California.

<doc id="485215" wikidata="Q498238" url="?curid=485215" title="Marutei Tsurunen">
<text>is a Finnish-born Japanese politician. He is the first foreign-born Japanese of European origin to serve as a member of the Diet of Japan. He is a member of the Democratic Party of Japan, where he served as Director General of the International Department. He served in the House of Councillors from 2001 to 2013.

== Biography ==
Tsurunen was born Martti Turunen in the village of Höntönvaara in Lieksa, Finland, and grew up in nearby Jaakonvaara. Near the end of the Continuation War, Tsurunen (then four years old) and his family were among the few survivors of a Soviet partisan attack on the village.

In 1967, at the age of 27, Tsurunen traveled to Japan as a lay missionary of the Lutheran Church, accompanied by his first wife, who was also a Finn; they later divorced. Having decided to become Japanese, he gained his Japanese citizenship in 1979. He moved to Yugawaramachi in Kanagawa Prefecture in 1981.

== Political career ==
He first ran for city council in 1992 in Yugawaramachi and won a seat, coming in fourth place with 1,051 votes.

He ran for a seat in the Upper House for Kanagawa without party backing in 1995. He received 339,484 votes, coming in fourth (the top three candidates were elected), losing a seat to the Socialist candidate who won 371,889 votes. He ran again in 1998 and took 502,712, just 8,000 short of winning a seat, telling voters &quot;Please vote for me and send the first Japanese citizen with blue eyes to the upper house&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s change Japan from an economic power into a citizen-friendly nation, where you don&#x27;t need to worry about old age and pollution&quot;. He also proposed &quot;sexual quotas for legislative bodies, so that from 40% to 60% of parliament and local assemblies would be female&quot;. In 2000, he ran as a candidate of the Democratic Party of Japan for a seat in the Lower House, and again in 2001 for a seat in the Upper House, both unsuccessfully. In 2001, he garnered 159,920 votes, 14,036 short of what he needed to win a seat. However, in 2002, an incumbent, Kyosen Ohashi, resigned from the house and he won a seat by &quot;kuriage&quot; replacement, by which he took the seat because he had the largest number of votes after the winner.

He was directly reelected in 2007 with 242,742 votes, the 6th-highest in his party, but lost his seat in the 2013 election after garnering only 82,858 votes (finishing in 12th place).

== Family ==

Tsurunen is married to Sachiko Tanaka, and they have two children. He also had three children with his Finnish wife.

== In the media ==

Finnish media personality Markus Kajo interviewed Tsurunen in Finnish for the third episode of the documentary series &quot;&quot; in 2006.

Tsurunen published his autobiography &quot;Sinisilmäinen samurai&quot; (&quot;The blue-eyed samurai&quot;) in 2015 via Gummerus.

<doc id="485220" wikidata="Q633625" url="?curid=485220" title="Fruit wine">
<text>Fruit wines are fermented alcoholic beverages made from a variety of base ingredients (other than grapes); they may also have additional flavors taken from fruits, flowers, and herbs. This definition is sometimes broadened to include any alcoholic fermented beverage except beer. For historical reasons, mead, cider, and perry are also excluded from the definition of fruit wine.

Fruit wines have traditionally been popular with home winemakers and in areas with cool climates such as North America and Scandinavia. In subtropical climates, such as in East Africa, India, and the Philippines, wine is made from bananas.

==Labeling==
Fruit wines are usually referred to by their main ingredient (e.g., &quot;plum wine&quot; or &quot;elderberry wine&quot;) because the usual definition of wine states that it is made from fermented grape juice.

In the European Union, wine is legally defined as the fermented juice of grapes.

In the United Kingdom, fruit wine is commonly called &quot;country wine&quot;; the term should not be conflated with the French term &quot;vin de pays&quot;, which is grape wine. In British legislation, the term &quot;made wine&quot; is used.

==Production==

Fruit wine can be made from virtually any plant matter that can be fermented. Most fruits and berries have the potential to produce wine. There are a number of methods of extracting flavour and juice from the fruits or plants being used; pressing the juice, stewing and fermenting the pulp of the fruits are common. Few foods other than grapes have the balanced quantities of sugar, acid, tannin, nutritive salts for yeast feeding, and water to naturally produce a stable, drinkable wine, so most country wines are adjusted in one or more respects at fermentation. However, some of these products do require the addition of sugar or honey to make them palatable and to increase the alcoholic content (sugar is converted to alcohol in the fermentation). Two commonly produced varieties are elderberry wine and dandelion wine. A wine made from elderberry flowers is called &quot;elder blow wine&quot;.

The amount of fermentable sugars is often low and needs to be supplemented by a process called chaptalization in order to have sufficient alcohol levels in the finished wine. Sucrose is often added so that there is sufficient sugar to ferment to completion while keeping the level of acidity acceptable. If the specific gravity of the initial solution is too high, indicating an excess of sugar, water or acidulated water may be added to adjust the specific gravity down to the winemaker&#x27;s target range.

Many kinds of fruit have a natural acid content which would be too high to produce a savory and pleasant fruit wine in undiluted form; this can be particularly true, among others, for strawberries, cherries, pineapples, and raspberries. Therefore, much as to regulate sugar content, the fruit mash is generally topped up with water prior to fermentation to reduce the acidity to pleasant levels. This also dilutes and reduces overall fruit flavor; a loss of flavor can be compensated for by adding sugar again after fermentation which then acts as a flavor enhancer (known as a &quot;back-sweetener&quot;), while too much acid in the finished wine will always give it undesired harshness and pungency.

Many fruit wines suffer from a lack of natural yeast nutrients needed to promote or maintain fermentation. Winemakers can counter this with the addition of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium available commercially as yeast nutrient. In the opinion of one wine writer fruit wines often do not improve with bottle age and are usually meant to be consumed within a year of bottling.

==Plum wine==
Plum jerkum is made from fermented plums in a manner similar to the use of apples for cider. It was often associated with the north Cotswolds and was once a product of the city of Worcester.

&quot;Umeshu&quot; (), sometimes known as &quot;plum wine&quot;, is a beverage popular in both Japan and Korea, made by steeping ume, or Japanese plums, in shōchū or another clear liquor such as sake. It is not a true fruit wine, as the plums are not fermented. It is commonly drunk mixed with soda or in a cocktail.

== Pomegranate wine ==

Pomegranate wine is a type of fruit wine.
A commercial pomegranate wine product was developed in Israel, and is marketed abroad as Rimon.
Since then, commercial pomegranate wine has also started also to be made in Cyprus, Turkey, Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan.

==Pineapple wine==

Pineapple wine is made from the juice of pineapples. Fermentation of the pineapple juice takes place in temperature-controlled vats and is stopped at near-dryness. The result is a soft, dry, fruit wine with a strong pineapple bouquet. Pineapple wine is popular in Thailand and other south-East asian countries, where it is made using traditional practices and is not available commercially. In Mexico, fermented pineapple beverages are very popular and given the name tepache.

Commercial examples from around the world include Maui&#x27;s Winery in Hawaii and Jacobs Wines of Nigeria, the first pineapple winery in Africa. It is also made in Dominican Republic by Vinicola Del Norte, its alcohol content is 10%. Several varieties of pineapple wine are made in Okinawa, Japan, from local produce. Its alcohol content is 11.5% ABV.

==Dandelion wine==

Dandelion wine is a fruit wine of moderate alcohol content that is made from dandelion petals and sugar, usually combined with an acid (such as lemon juice).

While commonly made as a homemade recipe, there are a handful of wineries that commercially produce Dandelion wine, including Bellview Winery of New Jersey, Breitenbach Winery of Ohio, Hidden Legend Winery of Montana and Maple River Winery of North Dakota.

==Rose hip wine==
Rose hip wine is a fruit wine. It can be made from fresh or dried rose hips. To produce this beverage, the rose hips are fermented in syrup with yeast and citric acid, creating an extract. This technique is used with only a few other types of fruit wine, including blackthorn (sloe), hawthorn, and rowan.

==Redcurrant and whitecurrant wines==
Redcurrant and whitecurrant fruit wines are beverages that are usually produced in northerly cool areas, where it is hard to grow high-quality grapes. They are simple to produce. Their natural chemical balances are such that they can be self-clarified without any additional substances. Redcurrants and whitecurrants contain only a small amount of carbohydrates; this necessitates the addition of sugar or honey.

==Cherry wine==
 
Cherry wine is a type of fruit wine made with cherries, usually tart cherries that provide sufficient acid. Cherry wines can be used to make fortified wines and liqueurs. Michigan wine makers, located in the leading tart-cherry-producing region of the United States, produce several varieties of cherry wine, including spiced versions and cherry-grape blends. &quot;Cherry Kijafa&quot; is a fortified fruit wine that is produced in Denmark from cherries with added natural flavors, and usually contains 16% alcohol by volume. Among cherry liqueurs &quot;Maraska&quot;, a cherry wine made from Marasca cherry from Croatia, is among the best known. The last couple of years Fredriksdal Cherry Wine (partly invented by distinguished restaurant owner Jan Friis-Mikkelsen) has been produced in Denmark. Cherry wine production is becoming popular in China, where cherry production is high.

==Orange wine==
Fruit wine can be made from oranges. This should not be confused with orange wine, also known as amber wine, which is made from grapes, but is orange/amber in color. Wine made from oranges, although not commercially widely available, is produced in White River, South Africa, and by home wine makers. The taste is a light bodied wine, pale or golden in color, dry, thin in body, alcoholic. Outcome is reliant on the yeast used. Recipes are few and far between. Typically a home wine maker is receiving the bounty of their own orange tree or from a neighbors tree. The wine can be difficult to make because the fruit is very acidic, and the pH must be adjusted up. Further complications are encountered by a type of Penicillium mold that can stop the fermentation and spoil the wine. Great care must be taken to clean and sanitize the fruit. The remainder of the process is straightforward. The US government Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau has a standard for orange wine.

== Other fruit wines ==
* Banana wine
* Lychee wine
* Fruit wine can also be made from Blackberry, Blueberry, Blackcurrant, Redcurrant, Cranberry, Elderberry, Gooseberry, Mulberry, Seaberry, or Raspberry.

==Fruit dessert wines==
There is also the option of producing fruit dessert wines. Many homemade country wines and fruit wines are made in a dessert wine style with more or less residual sugar and high alcohol content. But dessert wines don&#x27;t have to be sweet, e.g. the sherry fino. In Germany fruit dessert wines are fruit wines with more than 12.0% vol. In Austria they need an alcohol content of at least 13.0% vol. to a maximum of 22.0% vol. The total alcohol content may be increased by adding alcohol, fruit spirits, sugar, fruit juice and fruit juice concentrate to the fruit wine or cider. Fruit dessert wines can thus resemble classic dessert wines such as sherry or port wine. In US these wines are often labelled as fruit port and resemble fruit liqueur. It is also possible to produce fruit vermouth or other fruit wines flavored with herbs and spices. 

There are different production methods for fruit dessert wines. In Canada you can find apple icewine, which is produced by cryo-extraction (freeze concentration) of apple juice or apple cider (ice cider). Oxidative vinification (sherrisation) is used, for example, in apple dessert wine. Adding alcohol (port wine method, fortification) can be found with French pommeau or with cherry wine and other fruit dessert wines, for example, from Denmark. For fortified wines that are legally between wine and spirits, a tax is usually paid in accordance with the country-specific regulation.

<text>Death in the Afternoon is a non-fiction book written by Ernest Hemingway about the history, ceremony and traditions of Spanish bullfighting, published in 1932. It also contains a deeper contemplation on the nature of fear and courage. While essentially a guide book, there are three main sections: Hemingway&#x27;s work, pictures, and a glossary of terms.

== Contents ==

Hemingway became a bullfighting aficionado after seeing the Pamplona Festival of San Fermín in the 1920s. He wrote about the tradition in the novel &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;. In &quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot;, Hemingway explores the metaphysics of bullfighting—the ritualized, almost religious practice—that he considered analogous to the writer&#x27;s search for meaning and the essence of life. In bullfighting, he found the elemental nature of life and death. Marianne Wiggins has written of &quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot;: &quot;Read it for the writing, for the way it&#x27;s told... He&#x27;ll make you like it [bullfighting]... You read enough and long enough, he&#x27;ll make you &quot;love&quot; it, he&#x27;s relentless&quot;.

In his writings on Spain, Hemingway was influenced by the Spanish master Pío Baroja. When Hemingway won the Nobel Prize, he traveled to see Baroja, then on his death bed, specifically to tell him he thought Baroja deserved the prize more than he. 

&quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot; was published by Scribner&#x27;s on 23 September 1932 to a first edition print run of approximately 10,000 copies.

<text>Baron Hamilton of [[Dalzell House|Dalzell]], in the County of Lanark, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in for the Liberal politician John Hamilton. He had previously represented Falkirk and Lanarkshire South in the House of Commons and after his elevation to the peerage served under William Ewart Gladstone as a Government Whip from 1892 to 1894. His eldest son, the second Baron, was a Government Whip from 1905 to 1911 in the Liberal administrations of Henry Campbell-Bannerman and H. H. Asquith and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Lanarkshire. His nephew, the third Baron, was Lord Lieutenant of Surrey. the title is held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the fifth Baron, who succeeded his father in 2006.

The territorial designation is pronounced as in the usual pronunciation of the Scottish surname. The ancient family seat, Dalzell House in Motherwell, Lanarkshire, was sold in 1952. The third Baron lived in Bramley, Surrey. 

In 1980, James Hamilton, later to become the 4th Baron, inherited the Apley Hall estate of some 8,500 acres in Shropshire and the Betchworth estate in Surrey on the death of his cousin Major General E. H. Goulburn. The village hall at Betchworth is named the Hamilton Rooms after the family. As of 2004 the estate is divided into the land portion still owned by the current baron.

The Conservative politician Archie Hamilton, Baron Hamilton of Epsom (born 1941), is the second son of the third Baron Hamilton of Dalzell.

<text>Johannes Friedrich Heinrich Schmidt (July 29, 1843 – July 4, 1901) was a German linguist. He developed the &quot;Wellentheorie&quot; (&#x27;wave theory&#x27;) of language development.

==Biography==
Schmidt was born in Prenzlau, Province of Brandenburg. He was educated at Bonn and at Jena where he studied philology (historical linguistics) with August Schleicher and specialized in Indo-European, especially Slavic, languages. He earned a doctorate in 1865 and worked from 1866 as a teacher at a &quot;gymnasium&quot; in Berlin.

In 1868 Schmidt was invited by the University of Bonn to accept a professorship of German and Slavic languages. In Bonn he published the work &quot;Die Verwandtschaftsverhältnisse der indogermanischen Sprachen&quot; (&#x27;The Relationships of the Indo-Germanic Languages&#x27;, 1872), which presented his &quot;Wellentheorie&quot; (&#x27;wave theory&#x27;). According to this theory, new features of a language spread from a central area in continuously weakening concentric circles, similar to the waves created when a stone is thrown into a body of water. This should result in convergence among dissimilar languages. The theory was directed against the doctrine of sound laws introduced by the Neogrammarians in 1870, and contrasted with Schleicher&#x27;s phylogenetic model.

From 1873 to 1876 Schmidt was a professor of philology at the University of Graz in Austria. In 1876 he returned to Berlin, where he worked as a professor at Humboldt University. He died in Berlin at the age of fifty-seven.

<text>Leticia (&quot;Tish&quot;) Hinojosa (born December 6, 1955, San Antonio, Texas) is a folksinger recording in both Spanish and English. Hinojosa was the youngest of 13 children. Hinojosa&#x27;s parents were Mexican immigrants. Known for singing both traditional Mexican folksongs and her own original songs, both in Spanish and English, Hinojosa accompanies herself on guitar, which she plays right-handed although she is naturally lefthanded. Influenced by traditional Mexican, folk, Tejano, conjunto, and country musics, Hinojosa considers her music to be music of the US/Mexico border.

Hinojosa has recorded numerous albums and has charted twice on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts. Her 1992 album &quot;Culture Swing&quot; won the National Association of Independent Record Distributors (NAIRD) Indie Folk Album of the Year.

Using music to bring awareness to cultural issues, Hinojosa hopes to bring into focus the plight of migrant workers and children of the poor. Additionally, she often performs children&#x27;s music of her culture to help children develop an understanding of the Southwest&#x27;s Hispanic traditions.

In 2003 Hinojosa was convicted of smuggling date rape drugs into the United States and received three years of probation. 

As of 2021, Hinajosa lives in both Austin, Texas and Tubac, Arizona. In the 1970s and 1980s she also lived in Taos, New Mexico and Nashville, Tennessee. In 2005, Hinojosa moved to Germany, and in 2013 returned to Austin.

<doc id="485234" wikidata="Q1045896" url="?curid=485234" title="Forrestal-class aircraft carrier">
<text>The &quot;Forrestal&quot;-class aircraft carriers were four aircraft carriers designed and built for the United States Navy in the 1950s. The class ship was named for James Forrestal, the first United States Secretary of Defense. It was the first class of supercarriers, combining high tonnage, deck-edge elevators and an angled deck. The first ship was commissioned in 1955, the last decommissioned in 1998. The four ships of the class were scrapped in Brownsville, Texas, between 2014 and 2017.

== Design ==
The &quot;Forrestal&quot; class was the first completed class of &quot;supercarriers&quot; of the Navy, so called because of their then-extraordinarily high tonnage (75,000 tons, 25% larger than the post-World War II-era ), full integration of the angled deck, very large island, and most importantly their extremely strong air wing (80–100 jet aircraft, compared to 65–75 for the &quot;Midway&quot; class and fewer than 50 for the ).

Compared to the &quot;Midway&quot; class, the &quot;Forrestal&quot;s were longer and nearly wider abeam, resulting in a far more stable and comfortable aircraft platform even in very rough weather. When commissioned, the &quot;Forrestal&quot;-class ships had the roomiest hangar decks and largest flight decks of any carrier ever built. Because of their immense size they were built to a new, deep-hulled design that incorporated the armored flight deck into the hull (previous American design practice was to design the flight deck as superstructure). This was a very similar structural design as used on British &quot;armored&quot; carriers, and grew out of the requirement for such a very large carrier, because carrying the strength deck at the flight deck level produced a stronger and lighter hull. The &quot;Midway&quot;-class ships sat very low in the water and were poor sea boats through their long careers; they were very wet forward and their aviation characteristics were poor. The deeper &quot;Forrestal&quot; hull allowed the ships more freeboard and better seakeeping. The &quot;Forrestal&quot;-class carriers, like the &quot;Midway&quot; class that preceded it, were designed with armored flight decks.
&quot;Forrestal&quot;-class ships were the first examples of supercarriers and thus not quite a perfected design; their elevators in particular were badly arranged for aircraft handling. The portside elevator, a relic of the original axial-deck design, was especially poorly sited, as it was located at the fore end of the angled deck, in the landing path as well as the launch path of aircraft from the No. 3 and No. 4 catapults. The subsequent moved the portside elevator to the aft end of the angle and reversed the position of the island and the second starboard elevator, vastly improving aircraft handling. The sponson-mounted guns suffered from poor range and complicated firing arcs, and were located in very wet and thus nearly useless positions in the bow and stern. They were removed after only a few years and were later replaced by missiles and much later by close-in weapon systems (CIWS). The aft guns in &quot;Forrestal&quot; lasted until the fire in 1967, then were removed and eventually replaced by missiles in the mid-70s.

The original design of the &quot;Forrestal&quot;-class ships would have had a very small, retractable island; this design had numerous problems (the mechanism to raise and lower the island was never perfected before the angled deck was added to the design) and smoke fouling of the deck was expected to be a severe problem due to lack of adequate venting. The redesign to an angled deck allowed a very large island, much larger than on previous carriers, giving unprecedented flexibility and control in air operations.

 and were designed under project SCB 80 and laid down as axial deck carriers and converted to angled deck ships while under construction; and were laid down as angled deck ships and had various minor improvements compared to the first two. The most visible differences were between the first pair and second pair: &quot;Forrestal&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot; were completed with two island masts, an open fantail, and a larger flight deck segment forward of the port aircraft elevator; &quot;Ranger&quot; and &quot;Independence&quot; had a single island mast, a more closed fantail (as seen in all carriers since), and a smaller flight deck segment forward of the port aircraft elevator.

==History==
In the late 1990s, the US offered Brazil a &quot;Forrestal&quot;-class carrier, but the offer was declined on the grounds of significant operating costs; Brazil instead purchased the French aircraft carrier , which was renamed . All four ships have been struck from the Naval Vessel Register and have all since been scrapped.

<doc id="485239" wikidata="Q1046856" url="?curid=485239" title="Kitty Hawk-class aircraft carrier">
<text>The &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;-class supercarriers of the United States Navy were an incremental improvement on the vessels. Three were built, all in the 1960s, (1961–2009), (1961–2003), and (1965–1996), as well as the variant (1967–2007). All are now decommissioned.

==Improved &quot;Forrestal&quot; carriers==
The biggest differences from the &quot;Forrestal&quot;s are greater length, and a different placement of elevators; two are forward of the island, one is aft of the island and another on the portside stern. The movement of the No. 4 elevator from the forward to the aft end of the angle made it useful for aircraft movement, since the forward-end elevator in the &quot;Forrestal&quot;s was sited in both the landing path and in the launch path of the waist catapults.

Three different shipyards were used to construct the ships. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was built at New York Shipbuilding Corporation, &quot;Constellation&quot; at New York Naval Shipyard, &quot;America&quot; and &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; at Newport News Shipbuilding. &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; is similar to the earlier units in flight deck arrangement and propulsion, but has enough differences that she is placed in her own class. Propulsion consisted of four Westinghouse geared turbines, , four shafts with eight Foster Wheeler boilers.

==Construction and design differences==
The initial design for the class was known as SCB 127, and &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; and &quot;Constellation&quot; were completed to design SCB 127A.

The first three units were constructed with a Terrier surface-to-air missile system. The supporting missile launchers and AN/SPG-55 radars consumed a large amount of space, while at the same time duplicating the capabilities of the air defence escorts, and were later removed. &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; did not have Terrier and was built with the shorter ranged Sea Sparrow, Basic Point Defense Missile System (BPDMS). All were eventually equipped with NATO Sea Sparrow (NSSM) and Phalanx CIWS for self-defense. In 2001, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; received two Rolling Airframe Missile launchers replacing the forward Sea Sparrow and Phalanx CIWS equipment. The SLQ-32 Electronic Warfare Suite was added as part of the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) on &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; and &quot;Constellation&quot;.

&quot;America&quot; was designed under project SCB 127B and so had several differences from the lead units of the class. Instead of two forward anchors, one on each side, &quot;America&quot; had no port side anchor and an additional anchor astern, a change made to accommodate the AN/SQS-23 sonar. &quot;America&quot; was the only post-World War II U.S. carrier to be built with sonar, which was however removed in the early 1980s. She also had a narrow smokestack compared to prior units.

===&quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; class===
 was originally scheduled to be the fourth &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;-class carrier, but because she received so many modifications under project SCB 127C, she formed her own ship class and is often listed as a single-vessel class. &quot;Kennedy&quot; had similar design changes regarding the anchors to accommodate a sonar array, but the sonar was never installed. There was also a proposal to make her nuclear powered under competing project SCB 211A, but since Congress would not authorize it, &quot;Kennedy&quot; was constructed as a conventionally powered carrier. Her smokestack is also different and tilts outboard to send stack gas away from the flight deck. The angled end of the waist is also different from the other &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;s, bearing a closer resemblance to that of the . &quot;Kennedy&quot; is also shorter in length than the other &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;-class carriers.

==Decommissioning==
From 1987 to 1991 &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was overhauled for $785 million under the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. From 1990 to 1992, &quot;Constellation&quot; received her $800 million service life extension also in Philadelphia. The program was intended to add 15 years to the life of the ships. &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; was not overhauled as part of SLEP. Instead, from 1993 to 1995, she received a $491 million overhaul. It was the final project of Philadelphia Naval Shipyard prior to its closing. &quot;America&quot; had been scheduled to be overhauled under the service life extension program after &quot;Constellation&quot;, but she was decommissioned 9 August 1996 instead, during a time of budget cuts after the Cold War. &quot;America&quot; was in very poor condition when she was decommissioned, and therefore despite her historical significance was not held as a donation asset. She was expended as a live-fire target and sunk on 14 May 2005.

&quot;Constellation&quot; was decommissioned 7 August 2003. &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; was decommissioned on 23 March 2007. Only &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; remained in service as of early 2008 and was replaced by as the forward-deployed carrier in Japan. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; returned to the United States after the turnover. She was decommissioned on 12 May 2009.

<text>The Township of Wilmot is a rural township in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo in southwestern Ontario, Canada.

==History==

===Archaic and Woodland periods===

The earliest concrete evidence of human activity within Wilmot dates to around 8,300 years ago, in the Early Archaic period, though some artifacts are thought to be as old as 13,000 years. Early Archaic evidence is in the form of artifacts from the Hunsberger Creek site (AiHd-83). This site on the upper part of Hunsberger Creek saw occupation during the Early and Middle Archaic periods, as well as the Middle and possibly Late Woodland periods. In one interpretation of the site, it represents a place of significant repeated short-term occupation; namely, a &quot;headwater camp&quot; where mobile hunter-gatherers stopped near the uppermost part of a waterway before possibly returning down the waterway or migrating to another drainage system.

Archaeological investigation in Wilmot in the 1980s uncovered the largest known historic remains of a longhouse in North America. Originally in length, it was extended to reach a final length of and was home to up to 120 people. Along with three smaller longhouses, it formed the core of a village which may have had up to 600 inhabitants at its peak. Dated to between 1400 and 1450 CE (falling within the Late Woodland period), it is associated with the Neutral people, an Iroquoian society.

===Arrival of Europeans===
Wilmot Township was a Crown Reserve by 1791. After a survey in 1824, Mennonites from Waterloo Township and Amish from Europe began to settle here. The first settlement area was prepared by Christian Nafziger, an Amish Mennonite from Pennsylvania, but originally from Germany. After 1828, Roman Catholics and Lutherans from Alsace and Germany, Anglicans from Britain and others arrived and began to develop the area and construct buildings and roads. Most settlers were farmers. Much of the area was settled by those of German heritage, but also included some of Scottish, English, and Irish origins; the latter groups owned land primarily in the southern third of the township.

Likely to have been the first settler in what has been called Hamburgh or New Hamburg since about 1840, millwright Josiah Cushman arrived from Germany in the early 1830s. He dammed Smith&#x27;s Creek and built a sawmill that helped attract others. William Scott, (Lord Campfield in Scotland), now considered to be the founder of New Hamburg, arrived in 1838, after Cushman&#x27;s death. He renamed Smith&#x27;s Creek the Nith River, built a new dam and constructed a new lumber sawmill. The mill continued to plane lumber until 1902 when it burned down. The replacement building was a feed mill, later known as B-W Feed and Seed; that entity still exists, now as a sales outlet for feed.

Arriving in Wilmot in 1838, were John Meyer, Peter Wilker, Jacob Stoebler, Deobold Segler, and John Marteyne. In 1840, the township became part of the District of Wellington and received the right to elect officials and to tax land owners. The first Township council was elected in January 1850.

At the 1841 population count there were 2,200 people in the township, most of whom were self-described as &quot;Germans&quot;. The post office opened in 1844.

Records from 1846 indicate that the township consisted of 51,463 acres of which 15,310 were being cultivated. Existing villages included Hamburg and Haysville, and there were two grist mills and nine sawmills on the Nith River (previously called Smith&#x27;s Creek).

By 1864, the township included a Lutheran church, a tannery, one store, two hotels, two wagon makers, shoe and boot makers, as well as carpenters and mechanics. The school had about 60 students. The settlement was receiving mail daily. There were also two Roman Catholic Separate Schools in the township of Wilmot in 1864.

Some of the original settlements have Heritage signs indicating their location in the 1800s: Holland Mills, Josephsburg, New Prussia, Pinehill, Punkeydoodle&#x27;s Corner, Rosebank, Victoriaburg, and Waldau.

==Communities==
The township comprises the communities of Baden, Berlett&#x27;s Corners, Foxboro Green, Haysville, Josephburg, Luxemburg, Mannheim, New Dundee, New Hamburg, New Prussia, Petersburg, Phillipsburg, St. Agatha, Schindelsteddle and Wilmot Centre, as well as most of Punkeydoodles Corners, a crossroads which straddles the municipal boundaries of Wilmot, East Zorra – Tavistock and Perth East.

St. Agatha was initially called Wilmot and then it was renamed probably after the local Catholic church that had been built in the 1830s. 
Most early settlers to this area were German: Amish Mennonites, Lutherans, and Roman Catholics. The latter were the majority, making St. Agatha the centre of Catholic community in the Township. By 1834, there were two public log schools and a Catholic log school. More modern school buildings were erected about 20 years later. The Amish Mennonites built their meeting house in 1885.

Some of the settlers moved on to other areas so the community remained small. In 1869, the population was only and by 1890 it had dropped to 200. By 1906, there was a hotel, a blacksmith shop, some stores and various tradesmen.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Wilmot had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


At the time of the 2016 Canadian Census, of the population lived in single detached houses, higher than the in the Region of Waterloo overall, as well as the in nearby Kitchener. The single largest self-reported ethnicity was German (); also reported knowledge of the German language and reported it as a mother tongue. The second-largest self-identified ethnic origin was Canadian (), followed by English (), Scottish (), and Irish (). of people identified themselves as Eastern European, of which the largest ethnic group was Polish (). of people identified themselves as Southern European, of which the largest ethnic group was Italian (). of people identified themselves as Indigenous ( as First Nations and as Métis).

==Transportation==

Wilmot is bisected by both a mainline railway (the CN Guelph Subdivision) and a provincial highway (dual-designated as and through the township), which both run east–west. The railway passes through the cores of both Baden and New Hamburg, while the highway bypasses the town centres to the south.

Passenger trains on Via Rail&#x27;s Québec City–Windsor Corridor pass through Wilmot daily, but run as expresses through the township and do not stop. The nearest passenger train stations are Stratford to the west and to the east. GO Train service on the Kitchener line is also available at Kitchener station, which is its western terminus. A GO train station and storage and maintenance yard were planned to be located near Baden, but these plans were deferred following the opening of a GO train depot on Shirley Avenue in Kitchener instead.

, Wilmot is served by a single bus route, Grand River Transit&#x27;s Route 77 Wilmot. It operates on a 12-hour weekday schedule and uses &quot;flex stops&quot; to provide more convenient service to riders in certain areas. The route connects New Hamburg, Baden, and Petersburg to the Boardwalk bus terminal on the west end of Kitchener-Waterloo. After an initial pilot in 2016–17 which was funded by a provincial community transportation grant, the route was made a permanent part of the Grand River Transit system.

<text>In recreational mathematics, a Keith number or repfigit number (short for repetitive [[Keith number|F]]ibonacci-like digit) is a natural number formula_1 in a given number base formula_2 with formula_3 digits such that when a sequence is created such that the first formula_3 terms are the formula_3 digits of formula_1 and each subsequent term is the sum of the previous formula_3 terms, formula_1 is part of the sequence. Keith numbers were introduced by Mike Keith in 1987.
They are computationally very challenging to find, with only about 100 known.

== Definition ==
Let formula_1 be a natural number, let formula_10 be the number of digits of formula_1 in base formula_2, and let 
:formula_13
be the value of each digit of formula_1.

We define the sequence formula_15 by a linear recurrence relation. For formula_16, 
:formula_17
and for formula_18
:formula_19

If there exists an formula_20 such that formula_21, then formula_1 is said to be a Keith number. 

For example, 88 is a Keith number in base 6, as 
:formula_23
:formula_24
:formula_25
and the entire sequence
:formula_26
and formula_27.

===Finding Keith numbers===
Whether or not there are infinitely many Keith numbers in a particular base formula_2 is currently a matter of speculation. Keith numbers are rare and hard to find. They can be found by exhaustive search, and no more efficient algorithm is known.
According to Keith, in base 10, on average formula_29 Keith numbers are expected between successive powers of 10. Known results seem to support this.

==Examples==
14, 19, 28, 47, 61, 75, 197, 742, 1104, 1537, 2208, 2580, 3684, 4788, 7385, 7647, 7909, 31331, 34285, 34348, 55604, 62662, 86935, 93993, 120284, 129106, 147640, 156146, 174680, 183186, 298320, 355419, 694280, 925993, 1084051, 7913837, 11436171, 33445755, 44121607, 129572008, 251133297, ...

==Other bases==
In base 2, there exists a method to construct all Keith numbers. 

The Keith numbers in base 12, written in base 12, are
:11, 15, 1Ɛ, 22, 2ᘔ, 31, 33, 44, 49, 55, 62, 66, 77, 88, 93, 99, ᘔᘔ, ƐƐ, 125, 215, 24ᘔ, 405, 42ᘔ, 654, 80ᘔ, 8ᘔ3, ᘔ59, 1022, 1662, 2044, 3066, 4088, 4ᘔ1ᘔ, 4ᘔƐ1, 50ᘔᘔ, 8538, Ɛ18Ɛ, 17256, 18671, 24ᘔ78, 4718Ɛ, 517Ɛᘔ, 157617, 1ᘔ265ᘔ, 5ᘔ4074, 5ᘔƐ140, 6Ɛ1449, 6Ɛ8515, ...
where ᘔ represents 10 and Ɛ represents 11.

==Keith clusters==
A Keith cluster is a related set of Keith numbers such that one is a multiple of another. For example, in base 10, formula_30, formula_31, and formula_32 are all Keith clusters. These are possibly the only three examples of a Keith cluster in base 10.

==Programming example==
The example below implements the sequence defined above in Python to determine if a number in a particular base is a Keith number:
def is_repfigit(x: int, b: int) -&gt; bool:
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Determine if a number in a particular base is a Keith number.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 if x == 0:
 return True

 sequence = []
 y = x

 while y &gt; 0:
 sequence.append(y % b)
 y = y // b

 digit_count = len(sequence)
 sequence.reverse()

 while sequence[len(sequence) - 1] &lt; x:
 n = 0
 for i in range(0, digit_count):
 n = n + sequence[len(sequence) - digit_count + i]
 sequence.append(n)

 return sequence[len(sequence) - 1] == x

<text>The morphology of Irish is in some respects typical of an Indo-European language. Nouns are declined for number and case, and verbs for person and number. Nouns are classified by masculine or feminine gender. Other aspects of Irish morphology, while typical for an Insular Celtic language, are not typical for Indo-European, such as the presence of inflected prepositions and the initial consonant mutations. Irish syntax is also rather different from that of most Indo-European languages, due to its use of the verb–subject–object word order.

== Syntax ==

Word order in Irish is of the form VSO (verb–subject–object) so that, for example, &quot;He hit me&quot; is [hit-past tense] [he] [me].

One distinctive aspect of Irish is the distinction between , the copula (known in Irish as ), and . describes identity or quality in a permanence sense, while temporary aspects are described by . This is similar to the difference between the verbs and in Spanish and Portuguese (see Romance copula), although this is not an exact match; and are cognate respectively with the Spanish and .

Examples are:
* &quot;He is a man.&quot; (Spanish , Portuguese )
* &quot;He is cold (a cold-hearted person).&quot; (Spanish , Portuguese )
* &quot;He/Thomas is cold&quot; (= feels cold) (Alt. [= &quot;Cold is on him&quot;]). (Spanish – in this case Spanish uses (to have) instead of (to be), Portuguese )
* &quot;He is asleep.&quot; (Spanish , Portuguese )
* &quot;He is good (a good person).&quot; (Spanish , Portuguese )
* &quot;He is well.&quot; (Spanish , Portuguese )

==Nouns==

Irish is an inflected language, having four cases: (nominative and accusative), (vocative), (genitive) and (prepositional). The prepositional case is called the dative by convention.

Irish nouns are masculine or feminine. To a certain degree the gender difference is indicated by specific word endings, and being masculine and feminine. While the neuter has mostly disappeared from vocabulary, the neuter gender is seen in various place names in Ireland.

==Articles==

The Irish definite article has two forms: and . may cause lenition, eclipsis, or neither. may cause eclipsis, but the only instance of lenition with is with the genitive singular of the word meaning &quot;first&quot;. is used in the common case singular for all nouns, and lenites feminine nouns. In the genitive singular, with lenition is used with masculine nouns, with feminine nouns. In the dative singular, may cause lenition or eclipsis depending on the preposition preceding it and on regional norms (in Ulster usage, lenition is standard with all prepositions, while in other regions eclipsis is used with many). is the only plural form of the article; it causes eclipsis in the genitive for both genders, and no mutation in other cases.

Names of countries usually take the definite article in the nominative: &quot;France&quot;, &quot;Brazil&quot;, &quot;Japan&quot;. Exceptions to this include &quot;Ireland&quot;, &quot;Scotland&quot; and &quot;England&quot;.

There is no indefinite article in Irish; the word appears by itself, for example: – &quot;I have a pen&quot;, – &quot;There&#x27;s a dog in the room&quot;.

When two definite noun phrases appear as part of a genitive construction (equivalent to &quot;the X of the Y&quot; in English), only the noun phrase in the genitive takes the article. Compare or to English &quot;the residence of the President, the flight of the Earls.&quot;

==Adjectives==
Irish adjectives always follow the noun. The adjective is influenced by the case, number and gender of the noun preceding it.

* &quot;The small girl&quot; – masculine singular nominative
* &quot;The poor woman&quot; – feminine singular nominative
* &quot;The young boys&quot; – masculine plural nominative

Adjectives in Irish have two morphological degrees of comparison: the positive (), e.g. &quot;the boy is friendly&quot;, and the comparative (), e.g. &quot;the girl is nicer than the boy&quot;. A superlative () sense is rendered by the comparative in a relative clause, e.g. &quot;Seán is the nicest child of the three&quot;.

== Adverbs ==
Irish adverbs are used to modify verbs, adjectives and other adverbs.

An adverb can be created from an adjective by adding before it, e.g. , , , etc. If the adjective begins with a vowel, is added before it, e.g. , , , etc.

Adverbs can often be created from nouns by putting a preposition before them, e.g. , , , etc.

Other categories of adverbs include the following:

Adverbs that describe relation to time, e.g. , , , etc.

Adverbs that describe relation to place, e.g. , , , etc.

Adverbs used in questions, e.g. , , , etc.

Adverbs used for negation, e.g. , , , etc.

Other adverbs, e.g. , , , etc.

==Verbs==
There are two conjugations and 11 irregular verbs. Tenses or moods are formed by inflecting the stem, and in the past and habitual past tenses and the conditional mood also by leniting any initial consonant. The inflected tense and mood forms are: present indicative, present habitual indicative (differs from present only in the verb &quot;to be&quot;), future, past indicative, past habitual indicative, conditional, imperative, present subjunctive, and past subjunctive. Verbs also have a verbal noun and past participle, and progressive constructions similar to those using the English present participle may be formed from the verbal noun and an appropriate tense of . Examples of tense conjugations: (all third person forms without subject pronoun):

* 1st conjugation: &quot;to leave&quot; – (past) – (present) – (future) – (conditional) – (habitual past) – (subjunctive) – (imperative)
* 2nd conjugation: &quot;to buy&quot; – (past) – (present) – (future) – (conditional) – (habitual past) – (subjunctive) – (imperative)
* Irregular: &quot;to go&quot; – (past) – (present) – (future) – (conditional) – (habitual past) – (subjunctive) – (imperative)

In addition to the passive voice, there is the impersonal form of the verb, termed the or &quot;autonomous verb&quot;, which serves a similar function (the most literal translation is &quot;You/One/They...[e.g. say, are, do]&quot;).

Verbs can be conjugated either synthetically (with the personal pronoun included in the verb inflection) or analytically (with the verb inflected for tense only and a separate subject). However, the official standard generally prescribes the analytic form in most person-tense combinations, and the synthetic in only some cases, such as the first person plural. The analytic forms are also generally preferred in the western and northern dialects, except in answer to what would in English be &quot;yes/no&quot; questions, while Munster Irish prefers the synthetic forms. For example, the following are the standard form, synthetic form and analytical form of the past tense of &quot;to run&quot;:

==Pronouns==

===Personal pronouns===
Personal pronouns in Irish do not inflect for case, but there are three different sets of pronouns used: conjunctive forms, disjunctive forms, and emphatic forms (which may be used either conjunctively or disjunctively)
====Conjunctive forms====
The normal word order in Irish is verb–subject–object (VSO). The forms of the subject pronoun directly following the verb are called &quot;conjunctive.&quot;

The form in the 1st person plural has only recently been approved for use in the official standard, but is very common in western and northern dialects. The standard and southern dialects have no subject pronoun in the 1st person plural, using the synthetic verb ending (alternatively ) instead.

Irish has no T–V distinction, i.e. it does not differentiate between formal and familiar forms of second person pronouns. The difference between and is purely one of number.

There is no equivalent to the English &quot;it&quot;. Either or are used depending on whether the thing the speaker is referring to is a masculine noun or a feminine noun. The exception is the pronoun , used in impersonal copula phrases, particularly in the phrases (&gt; ) &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;so&quot;, &quot;that is so&quot;, (the opposite of ), &quot;is that not so?&quot;, (Kerry ) &quot;Is that so?&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s a man&quot;, and so on.

====Disjunctive forms====
If a pronoun is not the subject or if a subject pronoun does not follow the verb (as in a verbless clause, or as the subject of the copula, where the pronoun stands at the end of the sentence), the so-called &quot;disjunctive&quot; forms are used:

In Munster dialects the form is either (a) archaic (replaced by ) or (b) is only found after words ending in a vowel.

;Standard: (&quot;I hit you&quot;, present tense), (&quot;I hit you&quot;, past tense)
;Dialect type (a):, 
;Dialect type (b):, 

====Intensive forms====
Irish also has intensive pronouns, used to give the pronouns a bit more weight or emphasis.

The word ( or ) &quot;-self&quot; can follow a pronoun, either to add emphasis or to form a reflexive pronoun.

: &quot;I did it myself.&quot;
: &quot;Did you hurt yourself?&quot;
: is thus &quot;We Ourselves&quot;

===Prepositional pronouns===
As the object of a preposition, a pronoun is fused with the preposition; one speaks here of &quot;inflected&quot; prepositions, or, as they are more commonly termed, prepositional pronouns.

===Possessive pronouns===
The possessive determiners cause different initial consonant mutations.

Notes

# L= causes lenition on the next word.
# H= adds h- to the next vowel sound.
# E= causes eclipsis of the next word.

These forms (especially and ) can also blend with certain prepositions:
The object of a verbal noun is in the genitive case:
* &quot;He&#x27;s discussing his bicycle&quot; (lit.: He is at the discussing of his bicycle)

Similarly, if the object of the verbal noun is a pronoun, then it is a possessive pronoun:
* &quot;He&#x27;s discussing it.&quot; (lit.: He is at its (i.e. the bicycle&#x27;s) discussing)

More examples:
* &quot;She&#x27;s hitting me.&quot;
* &quot;They are discussing you.&quot;
* &quot;He&#x27;s kissing her.&quot;
* &quot;You&#x27;re hitting us.&quot;
* &quot;I&#x27;m discussing you (pl.).&quot;
* &quot;You (pl.) are kissing them.&quot;

===Interrogative pronouns===
Interrogative pronouns introduce a question, e.g. the words &quot;who, what, which&quot;. The Irish equivalents are:
* &quot;who?, which?&quot;
* or &quot;what?&quot;
* &quot;which?&quot;

Examples:
* &quot;Who did it?&quot;
* &quot;Who did you see?&quot;
* &quot;Who did you give the book to?&quot;
* &quot;What&#x27;s wrong (with you)?&quot; (lit. &quot;What is on you?&quot;)
* &quot;What did you say?&quot;
* &quot;What&#x27;s your name?&quot; (lit. &quot;Which name is upon you?&quot;)
* &quot;How old are you?&quot; (lit. &quot;Which age are you?&quot;)

==Numbers==

There are three kinds of cardinal numbers in Irish: disjunctive numbers, nonhuman conjunctive numbers, and human conjunctive numbers.

===Disjunctive numbers===
Disjunctive numbers are used for example in arithmetic, in telling time, in telephone numbers and after nouns in forms like &quot;bus 13&quot; or &quot;room 2&quot;.

=== Conjunctive numbers ===

====Nonhuman conjunctive numbers====
Nonhuman conjunctive numbers are used to count nouns that do not refer to human beings, e.g. &quot;horse&quot;

&quot;One&quot; as a pronoun is rendered with (lit. &quot;head&quot;) when it concerns things and animals, e.g.:
: &quot;I have five horses; one of them is sick.&quot;

====Human conjunctive numbers====
Human conjunctive numbers are used to count nouns that refer to human beings, e.g. &#x27;child&#x27;

&quot;One&quot; as a pronoun is rendered with (lit. &quot;person&quot;) with people. The other &quot;personal&quot; numbers can also be used pronominally, e.g.:
: &quot;I have five children; one of them is sick.&quot;
: &quot;Six people are in the room.&quot;

Higher numbers are done as with the nonhuman conjunctive numbers: , , etc.

==Phonology==
A notable feature of Irish phonology is that consonants (except ) come in pairs, one &quot;broad&quot; (velarized, pronounced with the back of the tongue pulled back towards the soft palate) and one &quot;slender&quot; (palatalized, pronounced with the middle of the tongue pushed up towards the hard palate).

<text>Stanley Jasspon Kunitz (; July 28, 1905May 14, 2006) was an American poet. He was appointed Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress twice, first in 1974 and then again in 2000.

==Biography==
Kunitz was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, the youngest of three children, to Yetta Helen (&quot;née&quot; Jasspon) and Solomon Z. Kunitz, both of Jewish Russian Lithuanian descent.

Six weeks before Stanley&#x27;s birth, his father, who was a dressmaker, went bankrupt and committed suicide in Elm Park in Worcester by drinking carbolic acid. His mother removed every trace of Kunitz&#x27;s father from the household. The death of his father would be a powerful influence on Kunitz&#x27;s life.

Kunitz and his two older sisters, Sarah and Sophia, were raised by his mother, who had made her way from Yashwen, Kovno, Lithuania by herself in 1890, and opened a dry goods store. She remarried in 1910 to Mark Dine The couple filed for bankruptcy in 1912 and then were indicted by the U.S. District Court for concealing assets. They pleaded guilty and turned over USD$10,500 to the trustees. Mark Dine died when Kunitz was fourteen; he had a heart attack while hanging curtains.

At fifteen, Kunitz moved out of the house and became a butcher&#x27;s assistant. Later he got a job as a cub reporter on &quot;The Worcester Telegram&quot;, where continued working during his summer vacations from college.

Kunitz graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in 1926 from Harvard College with an English major and a philosophy minor, and then earned a master&#x27;s degree in English from Harvard the following year. He wanted to continue his studies for a doctorate degree, but was told by the university that the Anglo-Saxon students would not like to be taught by a Jew.

After Harvard, he worked as a reporter for &quot;The Worcester Telegram&quot;, and as editor for the H. W. Wilson Company in New York City. He then founded and edited &quot;Wilson Library Bulletin&quot; and started the &quot;Author Biographical Studies&quot;. Kunitz married Helen Pearce in 1930; they divorced in 1937. In 1935 he moved to New Hope, Pennsylvania and befriended Theodore Roethke. He married Eleanor Evans in 1939; they had a daughter Gretchen in 1950. Kunitz divorced Eleanor in 1958.

At Wilson Company, Kunitz served as co-editor for &quot;Twentieth Century Authors&quot;, among other reference works. In 1931, as Dilly Tante, he edited &quot;Living Authors, a Book of Biographies&quot;. His poems began to appear in &quot;Poetry&quot;, &quot;Commonweal&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, and &quot;The Dial&quot;.

During World War II, he was drafted into the Army in 1943 as a conscientious objector, and after undergoing basic training three times, served as a noncombatant at Gravely Point, Washington in the Air Transport Command in charge of information and education. He refused a commission and was discharged with the rank of staff sergeant.

After the war, he began a peripatetic teaching career at Bennington College (1946–1949), taking over from Roethke. He subsequently taught at the State University of New York at Potsdam (then the New York State Teachers College at Potsdam) as a full professor (1949–1950; summer sessions through 1954), the New School for Social Research (lecturer; 1950-1957), the University of Washington (visiting professor; 1955-1956), Queens College (visiting professor; 1956–1957), Brandeis University (poet-in-residence; 1958-1959) and Columbia University (lecturer in the School of General Studies; 1963–1966) before spending 18 years as an adjunct professor of writing at Columbia&#x27;s School of the Arts (1967–1985). Throughout this period, he also held visiting appointments at Yale University (1970), Rutgers University–Camden (1974), Princeton University (1978) and Vassar College (1981).

After his divorce from Eleanor, he married the painter and poet Elise Asher in 1958. His marriage to Asher led to friendships with artists like Philip Guston and Mark Rothko.

Kunitz&#x27;s poetry won wide praise for its profundity and quality. He was the New York State Poet Laureate from 1987 to 1989. He continued to write and publish until his centenary year, as late as 2005. Many consider that his poetry&#x27;s symbolism is influenced significantly by the work of Carl Jung. Kunitz influenced many 20th-century poets, including James Wright, Mark Doty, Louise Glück, Joan Hutton Landis, and Carolyn Kizer.

For most of his life, Kunitz divided his time between New York City and Provincetown, Massachusetts. He enjoyed gardening and maintained one of the most impressive seaside gardens in Provincetown. There he also founded Fine Arts Work Center, where he was a mainstay of the literary community, as he was of Poets House in Manhattan.

He was awarded the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience award in Sherborn, Massachusetts in October 1998 for his contribution to the liberation of the human spirit through his poetry.

He died in 2006 at his home in Manhattan. He had previously come close to death, and reflected on the experience in his last book, a collection of essays, &quot;The Wild Braid: A Poet Reflects on a Century in the Garden&quot;.

==Poetry==
Kunitz&#x27;s first collection of poems, &quot;Intellectual Things,&quot; was published in 1930. His second volume of poems, &quot;Passport to the War&quot;, was published fourteen years later; the book went largely unnoticed, although it featured some of Kunitz&#x27;s best-known poems, and soon fell out of print. Kunitz&#x27;s confidence was not in the best of shape when, in 1959, he had trouble finding a publisher for his third book, &quot;Selected Poems: 1928-1958.&quot; Despite this unflattering experience, the book, eventually published by Little Brown, received the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry.

His next volume of poems would not appear until 1971, but Kunitz remained busy through the 1960s editing reference books and translating Russian poets. When twelve years later &quot;The Testing Tree&quot; appeared, Kunitz&#x27;s style was radically transformed from the highly intellectual and philosophical musings of his earlier work to more deeply personal yet disciplined narratives; moreover, his lines shifted from iambic pentameter to a freer prosody based on instinct and breath—usually resulting in shorter stressed lines of three or four beats.

Throughout the 70s and 80s, he became one of the most treasured and distinctive voices in American poetry. His collection &quot;Passing Through: The Later Poems&quot; won the National Book Award for Poetry in 1995. Kunitz received many other honors, including a National Medal of Arts, the Bollingen Prize for a lifetime achievement in poetry, the Robert Frost Medal, and Harvard&#x27;s Centennial Medal. He served two terms as Consultant on Poetry for the Library of Congress (the precursor title to Poet Laureate), one term as Poet Laureate of the United States, and one term as the State Poet of New York. He founded the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and Poets House in New York City. Kunitz also acted as a judge for the Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition.

==Library Bill of Rights==
Kunitz served as editor of the &quot;Wilson Library Bulletin&quot; from 1928 to 1943. An outspoken critic of censorship, in his capacity as editor, he targeted his criticism at librarians who did not actively oppose it. He published an article in 1938 by Bernard Berelson entitled &quot;The Myth of Library Impartiality&quot;. This article led Forrest Spaulding and the Des Moines Public Library to draft the Library Bill of Rights, which was later adopted by the American Library Association and continues to serve as the cornerstone document on intellectual freedom in libraries.

<doc id="485259" wikidata="Q3132490" url="?curid=485259" title="Henriette Wyeth">
<text>Henriette Wyeth Hurd (October 22, 1907 – April 3, 1997) was an American artist noted for her portraits and still life paintings. The eldest daughter of illustrator N.C. Wyeth, she studied painting with her father and brother Andrew Wyeth at their home and studio in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania.

After she and artist Peter Hurd married, they moved to San Patricio, New Mexico, in the mid-1930s and raised their three children on a ranch there. They were both inspired by the landscape and eventually had a 2200-acre ranch. One of her well-known quotes is: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what is important and what is unimportant, so I call it all immensely important.&quot;

== Early life ==
Henriette Wyeth was born in Wilmington, Delaware, into an artistic family. Wyeth was the eldest of the five children of noted illustrator N.C. Wyeth and his wife Carolyn Bockius. Her siblings Carolyn and Andrew also became artists, and all three studied with their father. Andrew Wyeth became the most well-known artist of this family.

Henriette contracted polio at age 3, which altered her health and use of her right hand. As a result, she learned to draw with her left hand and paint with her right. She grew up on the family farm in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, and attended local Quaker schools. She and her siblings were eventually homeschooled because their father distrusted the public school system. She began formal art lessons with her father at age 11, making charcoal studies and geometric shapes.

== Artistic career ==
A child prodigy, at age 13 Wyeth was enrolled in the Normal Arts School in Boston, Massachusetts. The next year, in 1921, she entered the Boston Museum of Art Academy. Two years later she moved to Philadelphia to study painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. By age 16, she was well known as a portraitist and received commissions for paintings of Wilmington residents. Deeply influenced by her father&#x27;s unique realistic style, she rejected early 20th-century painting styles such as Impressionism and Cubism. She was also socially and politically conservative. As a result, later in life she rejected the progressive movements of the 1960s and 1970s, including the women&#x27;s movement. She often criticized television and modern culture.

Soon after her student years, Hurd exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy (1927, 1936–44), where she was awarded the 1937 Mary Smith Prize for a portrait of her son Peter. Wyeth&#x27;s work spanned portraits of adults and children, still lifes, and floral landscapes. In her work, she &quot;often included objects that related to the subject&#x27;s interest or personality&quot;. She eventually stopped painting children because, as she said, &quot;today&#x27;s children--they are so deadpan.&quot;

She painted for Helen Hayes, Paulette Goddard, and Mrs. John D. Rockefeler III (Blanchette Hooker Rockefeler), for which she earned a lasting celebrity. In 1963, she painted a portrait of her brother Andrew for the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Hurd and Wyeth were both commissioned to produce a cover portrait of President Lyndon B. Johnson for &quot;Time&quot; &quot;Man of the Year&quot; issue. She received awards for her work, including the Governor&#x27;s Award in New Mexico and a Living Legacy Award from the Women&#x27;s International Center.

Her most widely known work is the official White House portrait of First Lady Pat Nixon.

== Personal life ==
At age 21, in 1929 Wyeth married artist Peter Hurd, a fellow student at the Pennsylvania Academy and her father&#x27;s apprentice. The couple had three children together: Peter Jr., Carolyn, and Michael Hurd. In the mid-1930s they moved to San Patricio, New Mexico, settling on a farm of 40 acres. By 1939, they established the Sentinel Ranch there, gradually acquiring more land until they had 2200 acres. It was in southern New Mexico near Roswell, New Mexico, her husband&#x27;s birthplace.

Wyeth&#x27;s father was not happy when they left the Pennsylvania area. As she said in a 1989 interview, &quot;He felt I should not let marriage interfere with my painting&quot; and worried that living on a ranch would draw her energy from it. Henriette Wyeth, however, did continue to paint for the rest of her life and was inspired by the landscape. Later health problems prevented her from making art. She criticized contemporary television and feminism, and said that modern society had &quot;blunted&quot; children.

==Death==
Henriette Wyeth died in her Roswell, New Mexico home-studio from complications from pneumonia in April 1997.
==Legacy==
According to her biography on the Wyeth Hurd Gallery website, she was &quot;considered by many art scholars to be one of the great women painters of the 20th century&quot;. Her papers, and those of her husband (who died in 1984), are in the Archives of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution.

== Exhibitions ==

Much of her work is held by the Roswell Museum and Art Center, in Roswell and at the Hurd La Rinconada Gallery in San Patricio, both in New Mexico. Her paintings can also be found in the permanent collections of the Brandywine River Museum in Pennsylvania, the Los Angeles Athletic Club, the National Portrait Gallery, the New Mexico Museum of Art in Santa Fe, and the Texas Tech University Fine Art Museum.

<doc id="485260" wikidata="Q923927" url="?curid=485260" title="Jaime Lerner">
<text>Jaime Lerner (17 December 1937 – 27 May 2021) was a Brazilian politician. He was the governor of the state of Paraná, in southern Brazil. He is renowned as an architect and urban planner, having been mayor of Curitiba, capital of Paraná, three times (1971–1974, 1979–1983 and 1989–1992). In 1994, Lerner was elected governor of Paraná, and was re-elected in 1998.

As an urban planner and architect, he was renowned in Brazil as he helped design most of the city walkways, roads, and public transportation of Curitiba such as the Rede Integrada de Transporte. In 1965, he helped create the Instituto de Pesquisa e Planejamento Urbano de Curitiba and designed the Curitiba Master Plan.

==Early life==
Lerner was born into a Jewish family, originally from Łódź, Poland, who emigrated to Curitiba. He graduated from the Escola de Arquitetura da Universidade Federal do Paraná; (Architecture School of the Federal University of Paraná) in 1964. In 1965, he helped create the Instituto de Pesquisa e Planejamento Urbano de Curitiba (Institute of Urban Planning and Research of Curitiba, also known as IPPUC) and participated in the design of the Curitiba Master Plan.

==Mayor of Curitiba==
In 1988, Jaime Lerner announced his candidacy for mayor of Curitiba with only 12 days remaining before the election. During his first term, Lerner implemented the Rede Integrada de Transporte (also called bus rapid transit), and continued to implement a host of social, ecological, and urban reforms during his ensuing terms as mayor.

As mayor, Lerner employed unorthodox solutions to Curitiba&#x27;s geographic challenges. Like many cities, Curitiba is bordered by floodplain. Wealthier cities in the United States, such as New Orleans and Sacramento, have built expensive and expensive-to-maintain levee systems on floodplain. In contrast, Curitiba purchased the floodplain and made parks. The city now ranks among the world leaders in per-capita park area. Curitiba had the problem of its status as a third-world city, unable to afford the tractors and petroleum to mow these parks. The innovative response was &quot;municipal sheep&quot; who keep the parks&#x27; vegetation under control and whose wool funds children&#x27;s programs.

When Lerner became mayor, Curitiba had some bairros impossible to service by municipal waste removal. The &quot;streets&quot; were too narrow. Rather than abandon these people or raze these slums, Lerner began a program that traded bags of groceries and transit passes for bags of trash. The slums got much cleaner.

Similarly, Curitiba has a nearby bay that was a dumping ground that would be extremely costly to clean up. Lerner began a program that paid fishermen for any garbage they retrieved (by the pound). That way, they can make money even outside fishing season, supplementing their income. The savings to Curitiba are in the millions.

Lerner instituted many innovative social and educational programs. Bairro kids can be apprenticed to city employees if they want to avoid going to school. Although his term as mayor is not without controversy, Curitiba does not have the gangs of much more populous cities such as Rio de Janeiro.

==Bus Rapid Transit==
Perhaps the crown jewel of Curitiba&#x27;s achievements is its Rede Integrada de Transporte Bus Rapid Transit system (called &quot;Speedybus&quot;). Originally, the city was given federal money to build a subway (Curitiba is not a small town), but Lerner discovered that &quot;heavy rail&quot; like a subway costs ten times the amount of &quot;light rail&quot; (trolleys), which, in turn, costs ten times the amount of a bus system, even with dedicated bus ways. The &quot;light rail&quot; savings usually touted to sway municipal decision makers occur because even trolleys can have relatively fewer drivers than a 40-60 passenger bus. He got Volvo to make 270 person &quot;Swedish&quot; articulated buses (300 Brazilians, said Lerner), so that the problem of a lower passenger-number-to-driver ratio was no longer an issue. The city built attractive transit stops with the look and feel of train stations, and all with handicapped access equipment, inducing private firms to purchase and operate the buses. A hierarchy of buses of six sizes feed one another. The city controls the routes and fares, while the private companies hire drivers and maintain equipment.

Natural land-use patterns within the city of Curitiba support public transit systems. Buildings along the dedicated busways are up to six stories tall, gradually giving way, within a few blocks, to single story homes. This mix of densities ensures sufficient user population within walking distance of bus stops.

==As Governor of Paraná==
As governor of Paraná, Lerner used a policy of attracting investment to turn the state into one of Brazil&#x27;s industrial hubs, generating investments of over US$20 billion between 1995 and 2001. Following upon his experience in Curitiba, Lerner focused on issues like transport, education, health, sanitation, leisure, and industrialization.

UNICEF awarded Lerner the Child and Peace Prize in 1996 for his programs &quot;&#x27;Da Rua para a Escola&#x27;&quot; (From the Street to School), &quot;&#x27;Protegendo a Vida&#x27;&quot; (Protecting Life), and &quot;&#x27;Universidade do Professor&#x27;&quot; (Professor&#x27;s University).

In 2011, Lerner was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison for the illegal layoff of a public tender during his mandate as governor. He wasn&#x27;t arrested due to his age.

==Later life==
At the General Assembly of the International Union of Architects in July 2002, Lerner was elected president for a period of three years. Lerner was also a professor of Urban and Regional Planning at the Universidade Federal do Paraná, his alma mater, and has been a guest professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

In April 2005, Jaime Lerner participated in the Symposium of China Bus Rapid Transit Initiative (Shanghai) to promote the BRT project in some larger cities. He was specially interviewed which made an impact on mayors and urban planners across China.

Lerner was a member of the Board of Directors of World Resources Institute.

Lerner died of kidney disease on May 27, 2021, at the age of 83.

<text>Alexandra Adler (24 September 1901 – 4 January 2001) was an Austrian neurologist and the daughter of psychoanalyst Alfred Adler and Raissa Adler. She has been described as one of the &quot;leading systematizers and interpreters&quot; of Adlerian psychology. Her sister was socialist activist Valentine Adler. Alexandra Adler&#x27;s husband was Halfdan Gregersen.

==Career==
Adler completed her medical studies at the University of Vienna in 1926, and then specialized in psychiatry at the University of Vienna Neuropsychiatric Hospital. She emigrated to the United States in 1935, where she worked as a neurology instructor at the Harvard Medical School. Also in 1935, she established the Journal of Psychology. In 1938, Adler became the medical director of the Alfred Adler Clinic, named after her father. Adler was one of the leading interpreters of her father&#x27;s theory, where she published many theories discussing individual psychology. In 1946 she joined New York University College of Medicine&#x27;s psychiatry department, and became a professor there in 1969. She also served as the president for the American Society of Adlerian Psychology.

== Medical Studies ==

From 1928 to 1938, Alexandra Adler conducted an investigation of known cases of encephalitis or encephalomyelitis at the Boston City Hospital. The study included over 100 patients. Patients were only admitted if encephalitis was the sole illness of the individual. The aim of the study was to contribute knowledge for these diseases.

In 1937, Adler conducted a study along with the Harvard neurosurgeon Tracy Putnam. The study was conducted on the brain of a patient with multiple sclerosis, resulting in new information on how the disease affected the human body. Illustrations from the study are frequently used in medical literature.

In 1943, Adler studied survivors of the Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire of 1942. The study found that 50% of the survivors still experienced trauma and disturbances a year after the accident. These symptoms included changes in personality such as lack of sleep, anxiety, guilt and fears of the event. After observations and following up 46 patients of the acute stage, it was found that survivors were only recognizing parts of what happened. It was theorized that this was due to the stress or a possible lesion in the brain due to carbon monoxide exposure. Adler became one of the first neurologists to create a detailed documentation of what is known as post-traumatic stress disorder.

In the 1950s and throughout the 1960s, Adler continued her father&#x27;s work of Adlerian psychology for possible treatments for schizophrenia, neuroses, and personality disorders. She believed this could be done through modern drug treatment, group therapy, and the existentialist and religious psychotherapies.

<text>Figment is a Disney character and mascot of the Imagination! pavilion at the Epcot theme park at Walt Disney World Resort. He is a small purple dragon with a runaway imagination, which serves as a plot device in Journey into Imagination with Figment, the most recent edition of the pavilion, and he is featured in Epcot merchandise.

==History==
Figment was created by Tony Baxter, who came up with the name &quot;Figment&quot; after watching an episode of &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, in which a goat has eaten Higgins&#x27; (John Hillerman) flowers and Higgins says, &quot;Don&#x27;t tell me [the goat is] a figment of my imagination. Figments don&#x27;t eat rare tropical flowers&quot;.

The Imagination! pavilion opened with the rest of EPCOT Center on October 1, 1982, but the Journey Into Imagination dark ride did not open until March 5, 1983. In the original attraction, Dreamfinder, a jolly wizard-like scientist, teaches Figment how to use his imagination. Figment&#x27;s original character design was created by Grayson Shafer in 1976. Maddie Shafer inspired him in his designs. Figment is meant to be the literal embodiment of the phrase &quot;figment of the imagination&quot;. He is composed of various elements Dreamfinder found in his travels including two tiny wings, large yellow eyes, the horns of a steer (or dilemma, according to a 1983 appearance on the &quot;Today Show&quot;), a crocodile&#x27;s snout, and the childish delight found at a birthday party. Figment is described in detail in the Dreamfinder&#x27;s song &quot;One Little Spark&quot; (by the Sherman Brothers). Dreamfinder introduces him: &quot;Two tiny wings, eyes big and yellow, horns of a steer, but a lovable fellow. From head to tail, he&#x27;s royal purple pigment, and there, voila, you&#x27;ve got a Figment&quot;.

Though taking on many disguises within the attractions, including being a superhero, a cowboy, a knight, a skunk, a dancer, a mountain climber, and a pirate, Figment seems to have some special aspirations to be an astronaut, from being seen in a spacesuit in the original and current attractions to dialogue in the original stating &quot;I wish I could be an astronaut. I bet I can use imagination to discover all kinds of new things!&quot; Because of this, Figment is frequently portrayed in merchandising in a spacesuit, in addition to some of his other roles.

In 1999, Disney radically refurbished the Journey Into Imagination attraction as part of its Millennium Celebration at Epcot, removing Dreamfinder and Figment except for fleeting glimpses of the dragon. That version, titled &quot;Journey Into Your Imagination&quot;, was a completely new experience in which Dr. Nigel Channing (Eric Idle of Monty Python fame) led a tour of the fictional Imagination Institute. The Channing character originated in the adjacent &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Audience&quot; 3-D movie attraction.

In the current version, Figment&#x27;s creativity has a bit of a larger effect on the world around him, be it transforming a large smell emitting machine into a slot machine, turning his house upside down, actually rearranging an otherwise static eye chart, and transforming the Institute into something almost reminiscent of the original in the finale. He can also pull a pair of glasses out of thin air to put onto Dr. Channing in the introduction and quickly change into a skunk costume in the Smell Lab.

After numerous complaints about the revamped attraction, including a Disney stockholder who questioned CEO Michael Eisner about Figment&#x27;s absence during the company&#x27;s annual shareholders meeting, a modest 2002 refurbishment modified the 1999 version to add the dragon as a playful foil for Dr. Channing throughout the Imagination Institute tour. The new version pointedly was branded Journey Into Imagination with Figment.

In the original attraction, Figment was voiced by Billy Barty; in the version in-between, Corey Burton portrayed Figment, and in the current version, Muppet performer Dave Goelz provides the voice, because Barty had died before the second version had shut down.

Outside the attractions at Epcot, Figment appeared in several Disney-produced educational short films in the late &#x27;80s, two of which featured Peter Pan and Alice from &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (each played by a live-action actor), and has a brief cameo as a painting in the Pixar films &quot;Inside Out&quot; and &quot;Toy Story 4&quot;. Additionally, Disney and Marvel published &quot;Disney Kingdoms: Figment&quot;, a five-issue miniseries focused on the origins of Figment and Dreamfinder, starting in June 2014, which was followed up with a sequel &quot;Disney Kingdoms: Figment 2&quot; in October 2015. In 2017, Figment also made an appearance in the Guardians of the Galaxy Mission: Breakout! dark ride attraction in Disney California Adventure as a collector&#x27;s item in the Collector&#x27;s archive. In October 2024, it is revealed that Figment will make its overseas debut, with the modified Figment popcorn basket from 2022&#x27;s Epcot International Festival of Arts will be available for purchase in Shanghai Disneyland.

A live-action film centered around the character is currently in development at Disney, with Seth Rogen producing under his Point Grey Pictures banner, Dan Hernandez and Benji Samit writing the screenplay.

Figment was announced as an unlockable racer in the &quot;Disney Speedstorm&quot; arcade racing game and was introduced when the game launched in early access on April 18, 2023. He is voiced in the game by A.J. LoCascio.

<text>Jolin Tsai (; ; born September 15, 1980) is a Taiwanese singer, songwriter, and actress. Recognized as the &quot;Queen of C-Pop&quot;, Tsai is one of the most influential figures in the Chinese-speaking world&#x27;s pop culture. Her continuous reinvention and versatility in musical style and visual presentation have established her as a leading figure in popularizing dance-pop music in Greater China. Tsai exercises significant creative control over her career, and her work, which often addresses societal issues and ideological themes, has achieved both commercial success and critical acclaim.

Born in Hsinchuang, Taiwan, Tsai gained prominence in 1998 after winning a singing competition organized by MTV Mandarin. Her debut album, &quot;1019&quot; (1999), was a commercial success and cemented her status as a teen idol with a significant following among teenagers. With the release of &quot;Magic&quot; (2003), Tsai transitioned to a more dance-oriented musical style, further establishing her reputation with &quot;Dancing Diva&quot; (2006), which solidified her role as a prominent dance-pop artist in the Chinese music scene.

In 2009, Tsai founded her own company, Eternal, and began to assert creative control over all aspects of her career. The album &quot;Myself&quot; (2010) marked a turning point, showcasing themes of girl power and concern for minority issues. Her subsequent album, &quot;Muse&quot; (2012), combined mainstream appeal with independent music elements, while &quot;Play&quot; (2014) was noted for advancing Chinese dance music on a global stage. Her album &quot;Ugly Beauty&quot; (2018) delved into themes of societal beauty standards and psychological complexity.

Tsai has sold over 25 million records, making her the highest-selling Taiwanese female recording artist since 2000. Since the release of &quot;Magic&quot; (2003), each of her studio albums has been the highest-selling album by a female artist in Taiwan for the year of its release, with four also being the highest-selling album overall in the country. She has won seven Golden Melody Awards, the most by any dance-pop artist in the award&#x27;s history. Tsai has frequently appeared on the &quot;Forbes&quot; China Celebrity 100 list, ranking in the top 20 for six out of ten years since 2010 and being named the number one Chinese female singer three times. Her net worth surpassed NT$2 billion in 2014, and she has been ranked as the highest-paid Taiwanese female singer 16 times between 2003 and 2022.

== Life and career ==

=== 1980–1998: Early life and career beginnings ===
Tsai was born on September 15, 1980, in Hsinchuang City, Taipei County (now Xinzhuang District, New Taipei City), Taiwan. She has an older sister and is of mixed heritage, with her maternal grandmother being a member of the indigenous Papora people. Tsai attended Hsinchuang Elementary School, Hsinchuang Junior High School, and Chingmei Girls&#x27; High School. During her high school years, she formed a band named Twister with her classmates and participated in various singing competitions to enhance her university application profile. Notably, she won the Chingmei Girls&#x27; High School Singing Competition and secured second place in the popular music category at the BCC National High School Singing Competition.

In May 1998, Tsai emerged as a standout performer in an MTV Mandarin singing competition, where she showcased her vocal talents by singing English songs. This victory led to her signing with Universal Music Taiwan in March 1999, marking her as a key newcomer for the label. Universal Music arranged a comprehensive training program for her over the following six months, which included dance classes twice a week to refine her stage presence, makeup classes to enable her to handle her own makeup during busy schedules, and speech training to prepare her for media interactions. Additionally, she was given opportunities to observe live performances in Ireland and the United States to gain further insight into the music industry. In June 1999, she was admitted to Fu Jen Catholic University, where she majored in English literature; she had placed first in the college recommendation examination.

=== 1999–2002: &quot;1019&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;, &quot;Show Your Love&quot;, and &quot;Lucky Number&quot; ===
On July 16, 1999, Tsai released her debut single, &quot;Living with the World&quot;. Shortly thereafter, on September 10, 1999, she launched her first studio album, &quot;1019&quot;, co-produced by David Wu, Peter Lee, and Paul Lee. This album showcased a fusion of musical styles, including pop, hip-hop, R&amp;B, and world music, highlighting her artistic versatility. Critics generally received the album positively, noting that it filled a niche for a girl-next-door singer in Taiwan at the time. Tsai&#x27;s combination of idol appeal and vocal strength, along with high-quality production, contributed to the album&#x27;s success, leading to sales of over 400,000 copies in Taiwan.

On April 26, 2000, Tsai released her second studio album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;, which featured collaborations with David Wu, Paul Lee, Peter Lee, and Chen Wei. This album continued to explore diverse genres, blending pop with hip-hop, rock, reggae, and R&amp;B. Critics praised her vocal development, noting a more powerful delivery and emotional range in both fast and slow songs. The album resonated with audiences, selling more than 500,000 copies and becoming the second highest-selling album by a female artist and the sixth overall in Taiwan for that year. Additionally, on May 5, 2000, she published a photo book titled &quot;Nineteen Years&quot;, which sold over 60,000 copies.

Tsai&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Show Your Love&quot;, was released on December 22, 2000, and co-produced by David Wu, Paul Lee, Peter Lee, Chen Wei, and Jae Chong. This album featured a wider array of musical styles and a more mature vocal performance. Critics recognized it as one of the most musically rich projects of her career with Universal Music, appreciating the balanced mix of fast and slow tracks. The album sold over 260,000 copies in Taiwan. Notably, on September 6, 2001, the music video for &quot;Fall in Love with a Street&quot; won an MTV Video Music Award for International Viewers&#x27; Choice.

On June 28, 2001, Tsai released the Mandarin version of the theme song &quot;Where the Dream Takes You&quot; for the Disney film &quot;&quot;. Following this, she released her fourth studio album, &quot;Lucky Number&quot;, on July 7, 2001. This album, also co-produced by David Wu, Peter Lee, Paul Lee, Chen Wei, and Kay Huang, integrated pop, R&amp;B, disco, and hip-hop. Despite being considered one of her most engaging works during her time with Universal, the album faced promotional challenges due to a contractual dispute with her management company, D Sound. Nevertheless, it sold over 150,000 copies and ranked among the top 20 highest-selling albums in Taiwan that year. On February 18, 2002, Tsai represented Mandopop alongside William Roedy, chairman and CEO of MTV, and the group t.A.T.u. on the cover of &quot;Businessweek&quot;.

=== 2002–2005: &quot;Magic&quot;, &quot;Castle&quot;, and &quot;J-Game&quot; ===
On July 23, 2002, Tsai signed a contract with Sony Music Taiwan. Shortly thereafter, on August 2, 2002, she published her book, &quot;The Masque of the Princess, the Spirit of Knight&quot;, which sold over 50,000 copies in Taiwan.

On March 7, 2003, Tsai released her fifth studio album, &quot;Magic&quot;, co-produced by industry figures including Bing Wang, Peter Lee, Jamie Hsueh, Jay Chou, and Huang Yi. The album featured a diverse mix of genres, including pop, disco, funk, ballads, hip-hop, and Britpop, tailored to suit her vocal abilities and artistic vision. &quot;Magic&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics and was instrumental in defining her musical direction, with dance-pop emerging as a prominent style. The album sold over 360,000 copies in Taiwan and over 1.5 million copies throughout Asia, making it the highest-selling album by a female artist in Taiwan that year and the second highest-selling overall. It garnered nominations for the Golden Melody Award for Album of the Year, with Tsai nominated for Best Female Mandarin Singer and Baby Chung nominated for Best Music Arranger for the track &quot;Prague Square&quot;, which Chung ultimately won.

On March 9, 2003, Tsai starred in the Taiwanese television series &quot;Hi Working Girl&quot;, which premiered on CTV. She also released several songs for the 2003 Hong Kong film &quot;Why Me, Sweetie?!&quot; on April 10, 2003. On June 14, 2003, Tsai graduated from Fu Jen Catholic University with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English literature. Later, on September 10, 2003, she released the theme song &quot;Mirage&quot; for the film &quot;Warriors of Heaven and Earth&quot; and translated Madonna&#x27;s book &quot;The English Roses&quot;, eventually translating five additional works for the artist.

On February 27, 2004, Tsai released her sixth studio album, &quot;Castle&quot;, again collaborating with producers including Bing Wang, Peter Lee, Jay Chou, Jamie Hsueh, Huang Yi, and G-Power. This album embraced a wide range of musical styles, including hip-hop, Latin, chanson, heavy metal, and Britpop. It was well received by critics and solidified her successful trajectory in the Chinese music scene, selling over 300,000 copies in Taiwan and more than 1.5 million copies in Asia, making it the highest-selling album by a female artist in Taiwan that year and the second highest-selling overall.

On August 7, 2004, Tsai commenced her first concert tour, J1 World Tour, at Hongkou Football Stadium in Shanghai, China.

=== Influences ===
Tsai has cited Madonna, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, and Destiny&#x27;s Child as major influences. In May 1998, she won a singing contest held by MTV Mandarin where she performed songs by Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. She acknowledged the significant influence that the two artists had on her during her student years, stating, &quot;I&#x27;ve been listening to music since I was a child, at that time, I often listened to tapes and radios. Western music was very popular at that time, I liked Whitney Houston, and I often recorded myself imitating her singing voice. After that, I made my debut as a singer by participating in singing competition.&quot; She also mentioned how Destiny&#x27;s Child were a source of inspiration for her, expressing admiration for the group&#x27;s singing and dancing abilities.

Tsai remarked that she became a fan of Madonna after watching her perform, and expressed a desire to &quot;lead trends in music, stage, dance, and fashion&quot; in the same vein of the singer. Taiwanese choreographer Bruce Chang recalled Tsai&#x27;s observations about how Madonna seldom does line dancing, yet her dance movements remained powerful. Tsai expressed a desire to emulate her, commenting, &quot;Madonna has always been an artist I admire and she has done a lot of stuff that became very innovative, even at the moment when her works have been criticized by a lot of people, looking back people still think of her as amazing.&quot; Tsai also believed that &quot;when making popular music, we should lead people to accept new styles and new elements, and challenge existing concepts.&quot; She has additionally cited Kylie Minogue, Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, amongst others, as inspirations.

=== Musical style ===
Tsai has utilized a diverse range of musical genres and concepts throughout her career. Tsai noted, &quot;Apart from experimenting with a variety of styles, I try to interpret and express them with my own colors&quot;. Tsai&#x27;s predominant musical style is dance-pop; she holds the belief that &quot;every singer must establish their own identity and unique traits.&quot; The singer expressed that &quot;Maybe I don&#x27;t have many representative ballad works, but dance music is what I am best at.&quot; Her debut album &quot;1019&quot; (1999) featured a variety of styles such as ballads, R&amp;B, and hip-hop. Her 2000 album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;, incorporated elements such as rock and reggae, and began to feature dance tracks such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot; and &quot;You Gotta Know&quot;. Her next two albums, &quot;Show Your Love&quot; (2000) and &quot;Lucky Number&quot; (2001), utilized R&amp;B and hip-hop styles in addition to disco elements.

Tsai&#x27;s 2003 album, &quot;Magic&quot;, combined elements of disco, funk, hip-hop, rock, and R&amp;B, and marked the singer&#x27;s shift towards a predominantly dance-oriented musical direction. Her 2004 album, &quot;Castle&quot;, expanded on the styles of its predecessor; it contained tracks such as &quot;36 Tricks of Love&quot; and &quot;Priority&quot;, which incorporated heavy metal elements, along with the chanson track &quot;Love Love Love&quot;. Many of the dance tracks on her album &quot;J-Game&quot; (2005) were heavily influenced by electronic music and retained the disco and hip-hop elements found in her previous two albums. The track &quot;Exclusive Myth&quot; incorporated hip-hop and Chinese traditional music. &quot;Dancing Diva&quot; (2006) is primarily a pop and electronic album; its title track is recognized for its exotic elements, while the track &quot;Good Guy&quot; utilizes electronic rock. &quot;Agent J&quot; (2007) showcased Eurodance and continued to utilize elements like disco and hip-hop. It also included the swing track &quot;Fear-Free&quot;.

Her 2009 album, &quot;Butterfly&quot;, experimented with synth-pop. &quot;Myself&quot; (2010) primarily utilized house music, but also included tracks such as &quot;Nothing Left to Say&quot; which incorporated R&amp;B and urban pop elements. &quot;Muse&quot; (2012) is a pop record with styles encompassing mainstream and independent music, with tracks such as &quot;Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Dr. Jolin&quot;, and &quot;Beast&quot; drawing influences from trance, progressive house, and techno, respectively. &quot;Play&quot; (2014) was largely influenced by electronic dance music styles such as trap and dubstep.

Tracks such as &quot;Necessarily Evil&quot; incorporated gothic rock, whereas &quot;Vulnerability&quot; incorporated soul music.

=== Voice ===
Tsai possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range. Since her debut, she has received criticism for her weak singing skills, directed towards her thin voice and limited vocal range. Taiwanese musician Bing Wang noted that while Tsai&#x27;s voice might be considered average, he acknowledged the distinctiveness of her articulation. Wawa Chen, one of the vocal judges from MTV Mandarin, also expressed appreciation for Tsai&#x27;s voice, whereas &quot;Sohu Entertainment&quot; felt that the singer&#x27;s vocals and delivery had improved substantially over the years. Qu Er from &quot;Tencent Entertainment&quot; felt that Tsai&#x27;s vocal skills have often been misinterpreted, and expressed that only a handful of singers can sustain such seamless breath control throughout an entire performance.

Tsai has been nominated for Golden Melody Award for Best Female Mandarin Singer four times, and won the award for her 2006 album &quot;Dancing Diva&quot;. Some observers questioned whether her vocal ability was enough for Tsai to be qualified to win the award. In response, chief jury of the 18th Golden Melody Awards Liu Ya-wen publicly praised Tsai&#x27;s singing and performance skills in &quot;Dancing Diva&quot;, and felt that the record signified the singer&#x27;s transformation from merely a performer to a true vocalist. During the 26th Golden Melody Awards in 2015, she received ten nominations for her 2014 album, &quot;Play&quot;. However, she was not nominated in the Best Female Mandarin Singer category after a judge pointed out significant pitch correction in the album, which swayed the votes of other judges. In response to this, Tsai&#x27;s manager Tom Wang dismissed the claim that Tsai had been reliant on pitch correction while recording &quot;Play&quot;. DJ Casey Cheng commented that he did not see an issue with pitch correction in the first place, emphasizing that &quot;records are designed to produce unique sounds.&quot;

In 2017, during her opening performance at the 54th Golden Horse Awards, she was off-key while singing a cover of &quot;Tian Mi Mi&quot; by Teresa Teng. As the following songs she performed were characterized by low pitches, critics believed her overall performance fell short of expectations as she usually excelled in songs with mid and high pitches. The performance sparked discussion and criticism, while Tsai openly acknowledged her mistakes.

=== Music videos ===

Tsai is often involved in the creative direction of her music videos, which have been noted for blending creativity and aesthetic appeal, while also considering commercial aspects.

The singer has been recognized for her unique approach to fashion throughout her career; &quot;Vogue Taiwan&quot;″s Anny Ting noted that Tsai&#x27;s style had evolved from a youthful and sensual aesthetic to a more contemporary and avant-garde approach. Tsai was initially associated with a girl next door image upon her debut, which resonated with a younger demographic and led her to be dubbed a &quot;Teenage Boy Killer&quot; by the media. Following a contractual dispute, she made a return with the album &quot;Magic&quot; (2003), showcasing a more fashionable and sexy image accompanied by energetic dance music. In recognition of her style, the Taiwanese edition of &quot;Ray&quot; magazine named her Taiwan&#x27;s &quot;Fashion Hierarch&quot; in 2003.

All I want to do is to encourage some people by saying things I think to be right, so that they know they are not alone.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Referred to as the &quot;Queen of C-pop&quot;, Tsai has emerged as a significant figure in the C-pop music scene, earning recognition for her music, image, dance, and resilience. Liu Hsiu-wen of &quot;Billboard&quot; noted that in the early 2000s, Taiwanese artists like Jay Chou and Tsai dominated Chinese-speaking markets across Asia, marking a golden era for Taiwanese pop music. Former chairwoman of the Kuomintang, Hung Hsiu-chu, remarked that Tsai&#x27;s artistic accomplishments have set a &quot;high standard&quot; in the C-pop music industry, adding that Tsai&#x27;s name had been synonymous with a generation&#x27;s vibrant youth over two decades. Liang Xiaohui of &quot;NetEase Entertainment&quot; suggested that when future generations reflect on the early 21st-century Chinese divas, Tsai might be the first name that comes to mind, in a similar vein to Madonna in the late 20th-century. In 2010, Tsai was honored as one of the Top Ten Influential Hong Kong/Taiwan Music Figures of the Decade at the Top Chinese Music Awards.

In addition to her influence on Chinese popular culture, Tsai has made significant contributions to social issues. Tamar Herman of &quot;Billboard&quot; described Tsai as a leading figure in Chinese pop music who has represented same-sex couples and diverse LGBTQ lifestyles through her &quot;vibrant&quot; pop songs, providing a platform for diverse expression in the conservative Chinese music scene. Herman noted that through her music that promoted self-love and understanding of differences, Tsai became a prominent icon in Asia&#x27;s LGBTQ community. Liao Yuanling of &quot;Business Today&quot; wrote that Tsai consistently uses her platform to advocate for gender equality, empowering minority groups to speak up for themselves. In a 2019 survey conducted by &quot;Cheers&quot; magazine and &quot;Elle Taiwan&quot; titled &quot;Who Are the Most Influential Women to the New Generation&quot;, Tsai ranked first in the field of fashion styles and second in both fields of gender issues and life attitudes.

Tsai is regarded for having led the way for dance-pop&#x27;s mainstream acceptance in the Greater China region. QQ Music critic Mimimao wrote that &quot;Jolin Tsai is undoubtedly the biggest contributor to the development of electronic dance music in the C-pop music industry&quot;, and opined that Tsai&#x27;s innovative approach had placed her &quot;far ahead&quot; of her contemporaries.

Fan Jung-ching of &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; Taiwan referred to her as a &quot;Great Chinese Dance Music Artist&quot;, writing how Tsai showcased the &quot;world-class quality&quot; of Chinese dance music to global audiences. Apple Music wrote that songs such as &quot;Play&quot; and &quot;Ugly Beauty&quot; not only served as &quot;sharp societal critiques&quot;, but also helped set &quot;new visual and creative standards for Mandopop&quot;.

Tsai and her work has influenced numerous artists, including Cyndi Wang, Rainie Yang, A-Lin, Lala Hsu, Eve Ai, Shi Shi, Emma Wu, Yao Yao, By2, and others. You Zuo from &quot;The Beijing News&quot; wrote, &quot;As one of the most influential female stars in the C-pop music scene, Jolin Tsai&#x27;s insistence on making breakthroughs in art and caring for the society deserves the respect of everyone who cares about C-pop music.&quot;

=== Products ===
In September 2007, Tsai and her sister launched the nail polish brand Oops! Jealous, initially available through the Taiwanese online shopping platform PayEasy. Tsai played a key role in developing the brand&#x27;s nail polish colors and styles. In August 2010, Oops! Jealous expanded its distribution by collaborating with PayEasy to sell products through vending machines at Qsquare in Taipei, Taiwan. By October 2011, the brand had entered the personal care retail market, establishing a presence in Watsons stores. However, the brand was discontinued in 2014.

In February 2009, Tsai, in partnership with Ken Erman, introduced the fashion brand Seventy Two Changes in New York City. The brand was initially sold at Nordstrom across 12 North American cities, with plans to expand into Asia, including Taiwan, China, Singapore, and Malaysia. In February 2010, it successfully entered the mainland Chinese market, opening its first flagship store at Shanghai Times Square. However, due to differences in business philosophy among shareholders in the U.S. and China, combined with the expiration of her two-year contract, Tsai stepped down as the brand&#x27;s designer in 2011.

On October 20, 2015, Tsai launched a fondant cake fan page titled Your Majesty on Facebook. Subsequently, on December 7, 2015, she established a company focused on the fondant cake sector, offering customized cake orders via Facebook and Instagram. By January 8, 2018, she reported that her cake business employed four cake chefs.

She also holds a Guinness World Record for the most Golden Melody Awards for Song of the Year. Her album &quot;Play&quot; garnered ten nominations, tying it with Jay Chou&#x27;s &quot;Fantasy&quot; (2000) and A-Mei&#x27;s &quot;Amit&quot; (2009) for the most nominations in history, while &quot;Ugly Beauty&quot; received eight nominations.

Internationally, Tsai has garnered several prestigious accolades, including the MTV Video Music Award for International Viewers&#x27; Choice for her music video &quot;Fall in Love with a Street&quot; in 2001, the MTV Asia Award for The Style Award in 2006, and the MAMA Award for Best Asian Artist – Mandarin in 2015. She has received nominations for the MTV Video Music Award Japan for Best Buzz Asia for the song &quot;Pirates&quot; in 2005, as well as for the MTV Europe Music Awards in the categories of Best Asian Act in 2012 and Best Taiwanese Act in 2015. In recognition of her contributions to the entertainment industry, she was awarded the Butterfly Award by Taiwan&#x27;s Ministry of Labor in July 2008. In October 2023, her song &quot;Untitled&quot; was nominated for the Golden Horse Award for Best Original Film Song.

In terms of chart performance, Tsai has achieved number one status on Taiwan&#x27;s Hit FM Top 100 Singles of the Year chart five times with &quot;Marry Me Today&quot;, &quot;Sun Will Never Set&quot;, &quot;Honey Trap&quot;, &quot;Play&quot;, and &quot;Ugly Beauty&quot;, making her the artist with the most number one songs on this chart. Each of her studio albums, starting with &quot;Magic&quot; (2003), has been the highest-selling album by a female artist in Taiwan for the year of its release. Notably, four of these albums—&quot;Dancing Diva&quot; (2006), &quot;Agent J&quot; (2007), &quot;Butterfly&quot; (2009), and &quot;Ugly Beauty&quot; (2018)—were the overall highest-selling albums in the country in their respective years.

== Personal life ==
Tsai&#x27;s personal life has attracted considerable public and media interest throughout her career. She has been linked romantically to three prominent male artists: Jay Chou, Eddie Peng, and Vivian Dawson.

Tsai and Chou first met in January 2001 while appearing on the CTV variety show &quot;Guess&quot;. Their relationship was noted when they were spotted dining together in Shinjuku, Japan, in December 2001 and subsequently meeting privately in Taiwan. However, by February 2005, following Chou&#x27;s public appearance with Patty Hou in Japan, the two began to distance themselves from each other. Tsai later performed as a guest at Chou&#x27;s The Era World Tour concert in Taipei in June 2010.

In January 2007, Tsai was seen with Eddie Peng in London, and they were also observed meeting privately in Taiwan on several occasions. In September 2008, Peng faced management issues reportedly linked to his relationship with Tsai. In August 2009, Peng&#x27;s former manager confirmed that the couple had been together for over three years since mid-2006, with their breakup speculated to be influenced by Peng&#x27;s mother&#x27;s disapproval of Tsai&#x27;s reluctance to publicly acknowledge their relationship.

Vivian Dawson entered Tsai&#x27;s life in July 2010 when he appeared in the music video for her song &quot;Love Player&quot;. They were seen together in Tokyo later that year and traveled extensively together in the following years. In November 2011, Tsai&#x27;s father indirectly confirmed their relationship, along with her past connections to Chou and Peng. Their relationship became more serious, as evidenced by a trip to New Zealand in February 2013 to meet Dawson&#x27;s parents. However, by December 2016, Tsai&#x27;s manager confirmed that she and Dawson had ended their relationship the previous month.

<doc id="485276" wikidata="Q788158" url="?curid=485276" title="Tokyo Monorail">
<text>The , officially the , is a straddle-beam, Alweg-type monorail line in Tokyo, Japan. It is an airport rail link that connects Tokyo International Airport (Haneda) to Tokyo&#x27;s Ōta, Shinagawa, and Minato wards. The line serves 11 stations between the Monorail Hamamatsuchō and Haneda Airport Terminal 2 stations. It runs on a predominantly elevated north–south route that follows the western coast of Tokyo Bay. The monorail is operated by the &quot;Tokyo Monorail Co., Ltd.&quot;, which is jointly owned by JR East, the system&#x27;s rolling stock supplier Hitachi, and ANA Holdings, Inc. (the holding company of All Nippon Airways). It carried an average of 140,173 passengers per day in 2018.

Plans to build Japan&#x27;s first airport rail link surfaced in 1959 as Tokyo was preparing to host the 1964 Summer Olympics. That year, the Yamato Kanko Co., Ltd.—later renamed the Tokyo Monorail Co.—was established to build the rail connection. Construction began in 1963 and completed on 17 September 1964, just 23 days ahead of the Olympic opening ceremony. Upon opening, the monorail operated between the Hamamatsuchō and Haneda stations, making no intermediate stops. It has since been expanded with infill stations and extensions, and there are plans to extend it to Tokyo Station in the future.

The Tokyo Monorail is one of two rail lines serving the airport, the other being the Keikyū Airport Line. At Hamamatsuchō Station, passengers may transfer to the Keihin–Tōhoku and Yamanote lines of JR East, as well as the Asakusa and Oedo lines of the Toei Subway via nearby Daimon Station. The monorail also connects with Tokyo Waterfront Area Rapid Transit&#x27;s Rinkai Line at Tennōzu Isle Station.

==Early history==
Tokyo&#x27;s Haneda Airport had emerged as the country&#x27;s international gateway by the time Japan&#x27;s commercial aviation industry recovered from the Second World War in the early 1950s. In 1959, the airport recorded approximately 910,000 total passengers and expected many more for the coming 1964 Summer Olympics. That same year, the government unveiled a plan for a central Tokyo-to-airport rail link. Opponents of the rail line briefly countered with a proposal to extend the Tokyo Expressway instead, but fears that this would only worsen vehicular congestion led to a preference for rail.

In August 1959, the Yamato Kanko Co., Ltd. was established to build the rail line; it renamed to Japan Elevated Railway Co., Ltd. a year later. The company applied for a route license to build a straddle-beam, Alweg-type monorail in January 1960, which the Japanese government granted the following December. The company selected Alweg due to two factors. First, the company&#x27;s president, Tetsuzo Inumaru, was an old friend of Dr. Axel Wenner-Gren, the founder of Alweg. Second, Hitachi, which would build the line, was keen on further developing the technology.

Project planners originally intended the monorail line to extend from Haneda Airport to Shimbashi or Tokyo Station, and the license that had been acquired allowed building it up to either station. However, opposition from residents living near the Shibaura Canal, which had been part of the proposed route, as well as cost overruns during the construction of the Tōkaidō Shinkansen, which drained government subsidies, resulted in a shortened route from the airport to Hamamatsuchō Station. To further minimize costs, the line was routed over other public waterways donated by local municipalities, which eliminated the need to acquire expensive private land, but reclaimed parts of Tokyo Bay, as well as rivers and canals. The resulting alignment removed a number of fishing and aquatic farming operations, and local fishing cooperatives had their licences revoked by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Among them was a seaweed harvesting field in Ōta Ward that had produced a premium brand of nori since the Edo period called &quot;Omori no nori&quot;.

The Ministry of Transport authorized the monorail project in December 1961. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on 1 May 1963, and the subsequent construction of the line progressed rapidly. In May 1964, Japan Elevated Railway Co., Ltd. again changed its name to Tokyo Monorail Co., Ltd. The line cost a total of (equivalent to approximately $60 million in 1964 dollars), of which was spent for construction and on rolling stock. Hitachi built the first-generation cars in Japan under license of Alweg (through the Hitachi–Alweg joint venture). Upon its inauguration, the Tokyo Monorail became the world&#x27;s first commercial monorail service and Japan&#x27;s first airport rail connection.

Service commenced on 17 September 1964, 23 days ahead of the Olympic opening ceremony on 10 October. At the time of opening, the Tokyo Monorail ran a total length of and served only its termini: Hamamatsuchō Station and the airport. Most of the artificial islands in Tokyo Bay had not yet been reclaimed, and the line mostly ran over water. The price for a one-way ticket was , which was relatively more expensive than other available options at the time. It was notably cheaper to take a taxi with four people to the airport than to ride the monorail. A recession following the Olympics resulted in a decrease in airport arrivals, which severely affected ridership. In 1966, the Tokyo Monorail was forced to reduce the price of its fare to to attract more passengers.

==Infill stations and later expansions==
Ōi Keibajō Mae became the monorail&#x27;s first infill station upon its completion in May 1965. It was originally built as a temporary station above the water along the coast and only operated on days when an event was taking place at Ohi Racecourse. Its permanent replacement opened two years later. The city government subsequently reclaimed the area around this station and developed a housing complex known as . In November 1967, an overpass connecting the monorail platform to the JR platforms of Hamamatsuchō Station was completed. Between 1967 and 1993, four more stations were built along the original alignment; these were Haneda Seibijō, later renamed Seibijō (1967); Shin Heiwajima, later renamed Ryūtsū Center (1969); Shōwajima (1985); and Tennōzu Isle (1992).

When the monorail began operating, the passenger terminal at Haneda Airport was located on the west side of the airfield, south of Seibijō, and this was the southern end of the line. Upon the opening of a new passenger terminal—now Terminal 1—in 1993, the monorail was extended to a new platform and another station, Shin Seibijō, was built for the employees of nearby maintenance facilities. Meanwhile, the former airport passenger terminal was razed and the monorail tunnel beneath it abandoned to make room for an extension of Runway B. The original Haneda Station, which was abandoned along with the tunnel, was rebuilt farther west along the new section of tracks and renamed Tenkūbashi Station in November 1998. Although the rails were removed and its entrance walled off, the now-unused tunnel remains otherwise intact today below the Runway B extension.

The monorail has continued to adapt and expand with the terminal changes and expansions of Haneda Airport. A single-station, extension to the airport&#x27;s then new Terminal 2 opened on 1 December 2004, and resulted in the renaming of the existing Haneda Airport Station to Haneda Airport Terminal 1 Station. The opening of a passing loop at Shōwajima allowed for the operation of express services from 18 March 2007. A new infill station to serve the airport&#x27;s new International Terminal opened on 21 October 2010. On 14 March 2020, the three stations serving Haneda Airport were renamed to coincide with the renaming of the International Terminal to Terminal 3. In Japanese, the word in the station names was modified to . From north–south, the stations are , , and .

===Planned extension to Tokyo Station===
In June 2009, Tokyo Monorail Co., Ltd., formally notified the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of its intent to convert the present single-track terminal at Hamamatsucho, which has remained unchanged since 1964, into a dual-track, dual-platform structure. To be built in six and a half years at an estimated cost of , this would increase the line&#x27;s capacity from 18 to 24 trains per hour and lay the groundwork for a long-mooted extension to Shimbashi Station. In August 2014, plans were revealed to extend the line from Hamamatsucho to Tokyo Station, running alongside the Yamanote Line tracks between Shimbashi and Tokyo at a cost of with construction taking approximately ten years.
However, in 2021 JR East has announced the construction of the Haneda Airport Access Line which will connect Tokyo Station with conventional rail.

===New terminus at Hamamatsucho Station===
As part of a redevelopment of World Trade Center Building, a new monorail station will be built at Hamamatsucho Station. It is scheduled to be completed by 2027.

==Route==

The Tokyo Monorail is long and traverses Tokyo&#x27;s Minato, Shinagawa, and Ōta wards. From its northern terminus at Monorail Hamamatsuchō Station, the line travels southbound as it crosses over the Yamanote, Keihin–Tōhoku, Ueno–Tokyo, Tōkaidō Main, and Tokaido Shinkansen lines. Upon entering Shibaura, it follows the edge of canals surrounded by artificial islands. On an artificial island within just east of Shinagawa Station and the main campus of Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology, the monorail starts to follow the Shuto Expressway Haneda Route alignment with a stop at Tennōzu Isle.

===Service patterns===

The following three service types operate on the line:
* 

Tokyo Monorail trains operate on an average headway of four minutes. This can be as short as three minutes and 20 seconds during peak hours. &quot;Local&quot; trains stop at every station, with end-to-end travel taking 24 minutes. &quot;Rapid&quot; trains bypass the Shōwajima, Seibijō, Tenkūbashi, Shin Seibijō stations, and take 21 minutes to travel across the line. &quot;Haneda Express&quot; trains make non-stop runs between Monorail Hamamatsuchō Station and Haneda Airport; these trains arrive at Haneda Airport Terminal 3 in 13 minutes, Haneda Airport Terminal 1 in 16 minutes, and Haneda Airport Terminal 2 in 18 minutes. The Tokyo Monorail started operating trains in December 2001, which departed from Haneda Airport at 11:50 pm; these trains began running all day three years later. In March 2007, the monorail replaced its original &quot;Rapid&quot; service with the two current &quot;Haneda Express&quot; and &quot;Rapid&quot; service patterns.

==Rolling stock==
All rolling stock that has ever been operated in the Tokyo Monorail since inauguration are built by Hitachi Rail. , the Tokyo Monorail operates three train types: 1000 series, 2000 series, and most recently, 10000 series. All trainsets run in a six-car configuration and are capable of running at speeds of up to . Each car has a combination of aisle-facing bench seats, forward and rear-facing seats, and seats in the center of the aisle. The latter is because the train floor is lower than the diameter of the load bearing wheels above the top of the beam, unlike trains built for newer Japanese Alweg monorails. The trains also feature extra space for hand luggage, as a convenience for air travelers. These trains are stored and maintained at Shōwajima Depot beside Shōwajima Station during off-service hours. The 1000 series trains were introduced from 1989, and the 2000 series trains were introduced from 1997.

From 18 July 2014, the first of a fleet of new 10000 series 6-car trains was introduced, replacing the older 1000 series trains.

Former rolling stock once used on Tokyo Monorail include the 100/200/300/350 series (from 1964 until 1978), 500 series (from 1969 until 1991), 600 series (from 1977 until 1997), and 700/800 series (from 1982 until 1998).

==Service==

The Tokyo Monorail operates from around 5:00 a.m. to midnight with over 500 trains. The first departure towards the airport leaves at 04:58 and the last departure is at 00:01. Towards Hamamatsuchō, the first departure is at 05:11 and the final departure is at 00:05 (final departure serving all stations at 23:38). Passengers using the monorail to travel to the airport can take advantage of check-in facilities at Hamamatsuchō. Japan&#x27;s domestic airlines (JAL, ANA, Skymark Airlines, and Air Do) have check-in counters and ticket machines right at the station. It carried its 1.5 billionth passenger on January 24, 2007.

An alternative to the monorail is the Keikyu Airport Line between the airport and Shinagawa Station. Both railways compete with bus services.

===Ownership===

The monorail line is owned and operated by the . In 1967, the Tokyo Monorail Co., Ltd. merged with Hitachi Transport Co., Ltd. and Western Hitachi Transport Co., Ltd. to form Hitachi Transport Tokyo Monorail Co., Ltd. after Hitachi Transport System acquired an 81-percent share of the company. The company re-established as the Tokyo Monorail Co., Ltd. in 1981. JR East acquired a 70-percent majority share of the company from Hitachi Transport System in 2002, with the remaining 30 percent going to Hitachi, Ltd. , the Tokyo Monorail Co., Ltd. is divided between JR East (79 percent), Hitachi (12 percent), and All Nippon Airways&#x27; holding company, ANA Holdings Inc. (9 percent).

===Operation and maintenance===

The , located next to Shōwajima Station, is the operations and maintenance center of the Tokyo Monorail. The complex houses an operations control room that controls the movement of trains, a power control room that controls the line&#x27;s power supply, a vehicle maintenance and storage depot where cars are inspected and serviced, a track and trolley inspection and maintenance depot, and a crew depot.

===Fares===
The Tokyo Monorail offers multiple fare types with varying lengths of validity and terms of use. One-way tickets, which are valid for the day of purchase, may be used to travel between two stations without making intermediate stops. Return tickets are similar but allow for a return trip; these are valid if returning to any Haneda Airport station within 10 days and to other stations within two weeks. Multiple-trip tickets are sold in books of 11 and are valid for two to three months. The purchase of &quot;school commutate&quot; multiple-trip tickets requires proof of a student discount certificate with the Open University of Japan. Groups of 15 or more can acquire discounted group tickets. A special discount ticket is offered to riders needing to transfer to JR East&#x27;s Yamanote Line. Commuter and travel passes are also available. 

Tokyo Monorail began accepting the contactless smart card Suica on 21 April 2002, and accepts other Mutual Use cards as well, such as PASMO. In 2009, the company began selling a specialized Suica design, branded as &quot;Monorail Suica&quot;. After a suspension of sales (except for commuter passes) due to the 2020–2023 global chip shortage, it was announced in January 2025 that the cards would be discontinued in March of that year.

Paper tickets may be purchased from ticket vending machines at any Tokyo Monorail station. , tickets can also be purchased from machines at the following airports: Fukuoka Airport, Hakodate Airport, Hiroshima Airport, Itami and Kansai airports in Osaka, Kagoshima Airport, Kumamoto Airport, Nagasaki Airport, Naha Airport, New Chitose Airport in Sapporo, Oita Airport, Okayama Airport, Takamatsu Airport, and Toyama Airport.

<text>A foreign-born Japanese is a Japanese person of foreign descent or heritage, who was born outside Japan and later acquired Japanese citizenship. This category encompasses persons of both Japanese and non-Japanese descent. The former subcategory is considered because of intricacies of national and international laws regarding the citizenship of newborn persons.

Dual nationality is not recognized in Japan. Under Japanese nationality law, people who acquire dual nationality before the age of 20 must choose a single nationality before reaching age 22, and people who acquire dual nationality after the age of 20 must choose a single nationality within 2 years.

<text>The Township of North Dumfries is a rural township in Ontario, Canada, part of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo.

==Communities==
North Dumfries includes the following communities: Ayr, Branchton, Clyde (formerly from Beverley Township, Wentworth County), Reidsville and Roseville. It also contains rural clusters and hamlets such as Brown, Clarkson, Dickie One, Dickie Two, Dumfries, Greenfield, Hall, H’Ayritage, Highway Twenty-Four, Innanen, Lockie, Mackie, McLean, Morrison, Orr&#x27;s Lake, Parker, Plumtree, Ranchlands, Riverview, Taylor, Wrigley and Young.

==History==
The history of North Dumfries is closely tied to that of the old City of Galt, now part of the City of Cambridge but which in the early 19th century was part of Gore District. Galt was founded on the east bank of the Grand River by Absalom Shade on behalf of William Dickson of Niagara. Dickson had bought of land in 1816 for 24,000 pounds, and named it after his hometown of Dumfries in Scotland. The Nith River passes through Dumfries in Canada just as the River Nith passes through Dumfries in Scotland. That same year, he had the land surveyed and opened it for settlement. By 1817, a number of sawmills were operating in the district and the population, comprising 38 families, had reached 163. In 1819, the first municipal meeting for the Township of Dumfries North was held.

In 1820, Dickson encouraged further settlement on his land by inviting other Scotsmen to buy land, resulting in a wave of immigration from 1825 until 1832 when every plot of land was filled.

What is now the village of Ayr, then consisting of three small settlements, was first settled in 1822 by Abel Mudge, initially as a squatter. He built a dam, a sawmill and a grist mill at the junction of Smith and Cedar Creek. A post office opened at the settlement called Mudge&#x27;s Mills in 1840, with the name Ayr, named after a town in Scotland. The other two settlements, Jedburgh to the east and Nithvale to the west, were not yet a part of Ayr but received their mail at the single post office. The population in 1846 was 230 persons, working in businesses such as a grist mill, barrel making, carpentry, wool processing, blacksmithing, tanning hides, making shoes and clothing, or carpentry. The population of Ayr did not reach 1000 until almost 1870. The largest business was a foundry.

In 1847 or 1848, the John Watson Manufacturing Company (later Ayr Machinery Works) had opened and became very successful, shipping iron implements across the country by 1870. By 1854, the village had a small library, two school houses, a fire company, a newspaper and a single (Presbyterian) church. 

In 1858, Cruickston Park house was rebuilt by New York architect Detlef Lienau for the American heiress Eliza Astor and her English husband Matthew Wilks, and was later home tot their son Matthew Astor Wilks. The house has been used as a filming location for TV series and for the 2010 film &quot;Red&quot;.

The village of Ayr, including Jedburgh, was incorporated in 1884 with John Watson as the Reeve. What is now North Dumfries originally formed the north half of Dumfries Township, hence the current name. With the introduction of the county system in the mid-nineteenth century, Dumfries was split between the new Waterloo and Brant Counties. The remaining southern half of the old Dumfries Township is now South Dumfries in Brant County. At about the same time Dumfries Township was divided, the City of Galt was extracted from it as an autonomous municipality within the new Waterloo County. Though the two municipalities (Galt and North Dumfries) were now technically separated from one another, their histories are tightly interwoven as the township nearly envelopes what was then Galt.

The township&#x27;s easternmost section (around the village of Clyde) was originally part of Beverley Township (now the city of Hamilton); it was transferred to North Dumfries Township in 1973.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, North Dumfries had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The ethnic makeup of the township is 97.5% White, 1% Aboriginal and 1.5% visible minorities, of which the largest groups are Black (0.4%), South Asian and Latin American (0.3% each). Around 21.2% of the population is under the age of 14, while those over 65 number 10.3%. The average age is 39.0. There are 3050 private dwellings occupied by usual residents, out of a total of 3103 dwellings. Mother tongues spoken are:

<text>George Alexander Drew (May 7, 1894 – January 4, 1973) was a Canadian politician. He served as the 14th premier of Ontario from 1943 to 1948 and founded a Progressive Conservative dynasty that would last 42 years. He later served as leader of the federal Progressive Conservative Party and Leader of the Official Opposition from 1948 to 1956.

==Early life==
Drew was born in Guelph, Ontario, the son of Annie Isabelle Stevenson (Gibbs) and John Jacob Drew. He was educated at Upper Canada College and graduated from the University of Toronto, where he was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Alpha Phi chapter). He then studied law at Osgoode Hall Law School. He served with distinction in World War I as an officer in the Canadian Field Artillery. After the war, he became lieutenant-colonel of the 11th Field Brigade and later honorary colonel of the 11th Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery. He was the author of a book about Canadian aviators in World War I, &quot;Canada&#x27;s Fighting Airmen.&quot;

He was called to the bar in 1920. He married Fiorenza Johnson (1910–1965), daughter of Edward Johnson, who was a noted opera singer (tenor) and later general manager (1935–1950) of the Metropolitan Opera House, in New York City. Drew remarried in 1966 to Phyllis McCullagh, the widow of George McCullagh, the former publisher of Toronto&#x27;s &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; and &quot;The Toronto Telegram&quot; newspapers.

==Entry to politics==
Drew was elected mayor of the City of Guelph in 1925 after he had served as an alderman. In 1929, he left to become assistant master and then master of the Supreme Court of Ontario. As a practising lawyer, he was in 1931 appointed as the first chairman of the Ontario Securities Commission by the provincial Conservative government and was fired by the Liberal government of the colourful Mitch Hepburn, who had come power as a result of the 1934 provincial election. Drew ran for the leadership of the nearly-moribund Conservative Party of Ontario at the 1936 Conservative leadership convention. He lost to William Earl Rowe, who appointed Drew to the position of provincial organizer for the party.

Drew broke with the Conservatives, however, when they opposed Hepburn&#x27;s attempt to crush the Congress of Industrial Organizations attempt to unionize General Motors in Oshawa. Drew ran as an Independent Conservative in Wellington South during the 1937 provincial election but was defeated, along with the Conservatives. Rowe failed to win a seat in the legislature and consequently resigned as party leader. Drew ran again for the Conservative leadership in 1938, this time successfully, and entered the Legislative Assembly of Ontario at a 1939 by-election as the Member of Provincial Parliament for Simcoe East. In the 1943 provincial election, he was elected in the Toronto riding of High Park. 

The Liberal government went through a series of crises during World War II because of Hepburn&#x27;s feud with Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King and his Liberal Party of Canada. The crises led to Hepburn&#x27;s resignation.

==Premier of Ontario==
In the 1943 provincial election, the Tories, now called the &quot;Progressive Conservatives&quot;, won a minority government, narrowly beating the social democratic Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) led by Ted Jolliffe. (Jolliffe and Drew had attended the same high school in Guelph, Ontario, the Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute).

===First term===
Drew won by responding to the mood of the times and running on a relatively left-wing platform, promising such radical reforms as free dental care and Medicare. His government did not implement much of its promised platform (including Medicare or free dental care), but it established the basis for the Tory regimes that followed by trying to steer a moderate course.

====Education====
His government introduced the &quot;Drew Regulation&quot; in 1944, which made it compulsory for Ontario schools to provide one hour of religious instruction a week. By religious instruction, Drew meant the &quot;instruction in the tenets of the Christian faith&quot;, a measure that was considered to be anti-Semitic by Ontario&#x27;s Jewish community. Rabbi Abraham Feinberg led the opposition to the Drew regulation and said that it was &quot;undemocratic, imperiling the separation of Church and State, and leading to disunity in society.&quot;

====Relationship with federal government====
Drew was strident in his criticism of the federal government of Mackenzie King, attacked its leadership in the Canadian war effort, chastised it during the Conscription Crisis of 1944 for not instituting full conscription, and accused it of attempting to centralize power.

====1945 election====

During the spring 1945 Ontario election, Drew ran a red-baiting campaign against the CCF&#x27;s Ontario section. The previous two years of anti-socialist attacks by the Conservatives and their supporters, like Gladstone Murray and Montague A. Sanderson, were devastatingly effective against the previously popular CCF. Much of the source material for the anti-CCF campaign came from the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP)&#x27;s Special Investigation Branch&#x27;s agent D-208: Captain William J. Osbourne-Dempster. His office was supposed to be investigating wartime fifth column saboteurs. Instead, starting in November 1943, he was investigating, almost exclusively, Ontario opposition MPPs and mainly focused on the CCF caucus. The fact that Jolliffe knew about these &#x27;secret&#x27; investigations as early as February 1944 led to one of the most infamous incidents in 20th-century Canadian politics.

The accusation led to Drew ordering the LeBel Royal Commission to investigate the charges made by Jolliffe. The charges stemmed from Ontario&#x27;s Official Opposition Leader Jolliffe, during the election campaign. He made the allegations during a campaign radio speech on 24 May 1945. Drew announced in a radio speech on 26 May that he would call an inquiry, and he appointed Mr. Justice A. M. LeBel to lead the commission on 28 May. Jolliffe and the Liberal leader, Mitchell Hepburn, made offers to withhold from electioneering and have the commission report before the election. Drew refused to postpone the election or to speed up the commission process. The commission began hearings on 20 June 1945, and heard final arguments on 20 July 1945. The report was issued on 11 October 1945, with LeBel agreeing with much of what Jolliffe charged but ultimately ruling that the Premier did not have a secret political police reporting to him, mainly due to the lack of direct documented evidence. In the late 1970s, that documented evidence was found, but the provincial government at the time considered the case closed.

The Conservatives got their majority, as they crushed the CCF on 4 June 1945. Drew&#x27;s party won 66 out the 90 seats in the legislature and reduced Jolliffe&#x27;s CCF to just 8 seats, which also meant that it was no longer the Official Opposition. Drew won 20 seats from the CCF directly, including Jolliffe&#x27;s. The &quot;Gestapo&quot; claims against Drew seemed to do little, if any damage, and the CCF got nearly the same percentage in the popular vote as had been predicted by a Gallup poll one month earlier.

===Second term===
====Hydro====
Drew&#x27;s government insisted on spending $400 million in a ten-year program to convert Ontario&#x27;s electricity system from 25 cycles per second (hertz) to 60, which would standardize it with the rest of North America. The standardization allowed the province to join the North American power grid to easily import and export electricity, a prerequisite for the province&#x27;s industrial development.

====Immigration====

Drew also helped spur postwar immigration to Ontario from 1947 to 1948 by setting up immigration offices throughout the United Kingdom and initiating cheap charter flights to bring an estimated 20,000 British immigrants to the province in what has been called the world&#x27;s first mass migration by air. Drew, a committed British imperialist, focussed on attracting British immigrants because he felt they were &quot;the right class of people&quot; to bring to Canada.

====Spending====

Drew&#x27;s government also increased funding for roads and highways and also increased funding for schools by increasing the provincial government&#x27;s share for education spending from 15% to 50%. Through a government that made investments to modernize Ontario, Drew laid the basis for the province&#x27;s postwar industrial expansion and for a Progressive Conservative dynasty that lasted 42 years and saw six successive Progressive Conservative premiers.

====1948 election====
While the Tories won a majority in the legislature in the 1948 election, Drew himself was defeated in his High Park electoral district, in west-end Toronto, by the CCFer and temperance crusader William &quot;Temperance Willie&quot; Temple, who had targeted Drew over his softening of Ontario&#x27;s liquour laws by legalizing cocktail bars in Ontario. Drew blamed a supposed future communist takeover of Ontario on the failure of Ontarians to re-elect him.

==Federal politics==
While it would have been easy enough for Drew to re-enter the legislature by running in a by-election, Drew decided to enter federal politics. &quot;Colonel Drew&quot; (as he liked to be called) won the 1948 federal Progressive Conservative leadership convention, defeating John Diefenbaker on the first ballot.

Progressive Conservative Party Member of Parliament (MP) George Russell Boucher resigned his Carleton seat so that Drew could then contest it in a by-election in order to enter the House of Commons. The federal Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) was determined to defeat him, so they ran Eugene Forsey as their candidate. Bill Temple was brought up from Toronto to appear at a political meeting in Richmond, Ontario&#x27;s Town Hall, where Forsey and Drew were speaking. He accused the Tory leader of being &quot;a tool of the liquor interests&quot; and also made suggestions about Drew&#x27;s sobriety. Throughout the evening Drew grew more red-faced and explosive every time Temple spoke. Finally, after Drew misheard Temple calling him dishonest, the two men were restrained before they could come to physical blows with each other. A riot was barely averted, and the meeting had to be terminated. On December 20, 1948, Drew soundly defeated Forsey by over 8,000 votes — forcing the CCF candidate to lose his deposit — and went on to sit in Parliament. As leader of the federal Progressive Conservative Party and now an MP, he became Leader of the Opposition.

In the 1949 and 1953 federal elections, Drew&#x27;s Tories were defeated handily by the Liberals, led by Louis St. Laurent. As a federal politician, Drew alienated potential supporters in Quebec when it was remembered that he had called French-Canadians a &quot;defeated race&quot;. This rhetoric may not have been as damaging among some English-Canadian voters when he had been a provincial politician, but it was now used against him by his federal opponents. His support for conscription during World War II also hurt his prospects among French-Canadian voters. He ran against Forsey again in the Carleton district and defeated him by an even wider margin on June 27, 1949.

Drew led the PCs into one more general election in 1953, with slightly better results than the previous election. In poor health following a nearly fatal attack of meningitis, Drew resigned as Progressive Conservative leader on September 21 1956, and was succeeded by John Diefenbaker. On 12 December 1956 he received the Key to the City of Ottawa.

==Later life==
From 1957 to 1964 he served as Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and meanwhile worked with the newspaper baron and fellow Canadian Lord Beaverbrook in an attempt to influence British public opinion against joining the European Common Market, which Drew saw as a threat to the British Commonwealth.

Drew served as the first Chancellor of the University of Guelph from 1965 to 1971. In 1967, &quot;for his services in government,&quot; he entered the newly created Order of Canada as a Companion. In November 1972, he had a heart attack and was admitted to Wellesley Hospital on November 19. His condition worsened due to congestive heart failure, and he slipped into and out of consciousness in late December and early January. In 1973, Drew died of heart failure in his Wellesley Hospital room at 78. He requested not to receive a state funeral and had a public family funeral in Toronto. He was buried in his family&#x27;s plot, next to his first wife, Fiorenza Johnson, in the Woodlawn Cemetery in Guelph.

<text>The Hope Valley line is a trans-Pennine railway line in Northern England, linking Manchester with Sheffield. It was completed in 1894.

Passenger services on the line are operated by Northern Trains, East Midlands Railway and TransPennine Express, while the quarries around Hope, producing stone and cement, provide a source of freight traffic.

From , the line follows the Midland Main Line through the south-west of the city to , where the Hope Valley line branches off to run through the Totley Tunnel, the fourth-longest tunnel in England. It emerges in the Hope Valley area of Derbyshire, where it passes through the stations of , , , and before entering the two-mile-long Cowburn Tunnel. From the western portal of the tunnel, the line runs through Chinley, then splits. The northern branch runs via towards . The southern branch passes through the Disley Tunnel before merging with the Buxton line just south of and then heading to to join the West Coast Main Line to Manchester.

==History==
===Sheffield and Midland Joint Section===
This section was built by the Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies&#x27; Committee as part of the Midland Railway&#x27;s drive to reach Manchester with its line from London via and . Initially, in 1867, it joined the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway at Hyde Junction, running into Manchester London Road, but in 1875 a more direct route was built through . When was opened by the Cheshire Lines Committee, a new line was built through . This third route was closed along with Manchester Central, apart from the section through Disley Tunnel to , where it now joins the old LNWR line into .

===Dore and Chinley===
In 1872, the Midland Railway&#x27;s only route from Sheffield to Manchester was via Ambergate. It had originally proposed a line to run from Dore to Hassop, meeting its extension from Rowsley to . However, the &quot;Dore and Chinley Railway&quot; was floated independently in 1872 and, unsuccessfully, until the Midland took an interest, since it would provide a more direct route, connecting through Chinley into Manchester. The line was authorised in 1884 and work began in 1888.

The line took five years to build, opening to goods traffic in November 1893, with passenger traffic being carried from June 1894. The terrain through Hope Valley and the Vale of Edale was easy enough by Midland standards, but at each end there were formidable obstacles, negotiated by means of the Totley and Cowburn Tunnels.

===20th century===
At the time of the Beeching review, the line was running in competition with the recently modernised and faster Woodhead Line and its closure was suggested. On appeal, British Rail was required to keep the Hope Valley line open to passenger traffic; it was decided that the Woodhead route would be closed to passenger traffic instead and then subsequently to all traffic in 1981, due to the high cost of further upgrading the line to modern standards.

===Metrolink proposals===
In the early 1980s, proposals were put forward to convert the Piccadilly–Belle Vue–Rose Hill/Marple section of the Hope Valley line to light rail operation for the proposed Manchester Metrolink system. While construction of Metrolink went ahead, the Hope Valley line was not included in the system which was completed in 1992. When in 2000, proposals for a large-scale extension of Metrolink were announced by the government, these still did not include conversion of the Hope Valley line; but, subsequently, planning documents from Network Rail and from the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Authority have suggested that this route might be appropriate for tram-train operation, and, as such, it was suggested to the Department for Transport as a possible location for a national tram-train pilot.

===2019 closure===
On 1 August 2019, the line was closed between Marple and Sheffield amid fears that the dam at Toddbrook Reservoir would collapse, following heavy rain, which would flood the town of Whaley Bridge. The Buxton line, between Hazel Grove and Buxton, was also closed because of this. The line was re-opened on 7 August 2019.
==Services==
The following passenger services traverse all or part of the Hope Valley Line:



==Future==
In 2005 planning applications for various parts of a capacity and modernisation scheme were submitted. In 2015, a consultation pack on the capacity enhancement of the line was released by Network Rail.

Nottinghamshire County Council and the Department for Transport have investigated the possibility of adding another service that does not call at Sheffield in order to improve the journey time between Nottingham and Manchester. Stopping (and changing direction) in Sheffield, the fastest journey is 110 minutes (in 2019), but the council has estimated bypassing Sheffield would cut the time to 85 minutes. Suggested improvements on a stretch near Stockport may reduce journey times by 2–3 minutes.

Network Rail, in partnership with South Yorkshire ITA, will redouble the track between Dore Station Junction and Dore West Junction, at an estimated cost of £15 million. This costing is based on four additional vehicles in traffic to deliver the option, however, this will depend on vehicle allocation through the DfT rolling stock plan. This work will be programmed, subject to funding, in conjunction with signalling renewals in the Dore/Totley Tunnel area.

In 2018, proposals were published for works in order to fit in an all-day (07:00–19:00) hourly Manchester–Sheffield via New Mills Central stopping service, by extending an existing Manchester–New Mills Central service. Planning permission for the upgrade was granted in February 2018, but delays mean that this will now not be completed until 2023. The TWAO was also published in 2018. These changes to allow three fast trains, a stopping train and freight trains each hour were also supported in a Transport for the North investment report in 2019, together with “further interventions” for the Northern Powerhouse Rail programme.

In March 2021, it was announced by Minister of State for Transport, Andrew Stephenson, that £137 million would be used to upgrade the line. The local MP Robert Largan claimed he had campaigned hard for this upgrade. A joint venture between Volker Rail and Story Contracting was awarded an £80 million contract for the delayed Hope Valley upgrade. The work includes creating a passing loop between Bamford and Hathersage, and adding a second track and platform at Dore and Totley station. This will allow passenger trains to pass slower-moving freight and allow three fast trains per hour between Manchester and Sheffield. There will also be improvements to the Jaggers Lane Bridge in Hathersage. Work started on 29 May 2022 and is expected to be complete by spring 2024.

==Freight==

Around 66% of the works output ( per year) of cement from Hope Cement Works a year is taken away by rail from the seven-road &quot;Earle&#x27;s Sidings&quot; at Hope. When G &amp; T Earle opened Earle&#x27;s Cement works in 1929, it was linked to the Hope Valley Line by a single track railway, which was worked by steam until 1963. Most of the cement now travels over it in trains hauled by locomotives to Earle&#x27;s Sidings, where it is taken over by Freightliner.

<text>Facial perception is an individual&#x27;s understanding and interpretation of the face. Here, perception implies the presence of consciousness and hence excludes automated facial recognition systems. Although facial recognition is found in other species, this article focuses on facial perception in humans.

The perception of facial features is an important part of social cognition. Information gathered from the face helps people understand each other&#x27;s identity, what they are thinking and feeling, anticipate their actions, recognize their emotions, build connections, and communicate through body language. Developing facial recognition is a necessary building block for complex societal constructs. Being able to perceive identity, mood, age, sex, and race lets people mold the way we interact with one another, and understand our immediate surroundings.

Though facial perception is mainly considered to stem from visual intake, studies have shown that even people born blind can learn face perception without vision. Studies have supported the notion of a specialized mechanism for perceiving faces.

Theories about the processes involved in adult face perception have largely come from two sources; research on normal adult face perception and the study of impairments in face perception that are caused by brain injury or neurological illness.

=== Bruce &amp; Young model ===

One of the most widely accepted theories of face perception argues that understanding faces involves several stages: from basic perceptual manipulations on the sensory information to derive details about the person (such as age, gender or attractiveness), to being able to recall meaningful details such as their name and any relevant past experiences of the individual.

This model, developed by Vicki Bruce and Andrew Young in 1986, argues that face perception involves independent sub-processes working in unison.

# A &quot;view centered description&quot; is derived from the perceptual input. Simple physical aspects of the face are used to work out age, gender or basic facial expressions. Most analysis at this stage is on feature-by-feature basis.
# This initial information is used to create a structural model of the face, which allows it to be compared to other faces in memory. This explains why the same person from a novel angle can still be recognized (see Thatcher effect).
# The structurally encoded representation is transferred to theoretical &quot;face recognition units&quot; that are used with &quot;personal identity nodes&quot; to identify a person through information from semantic memory. Interestingly, the ability to produce someone&#x27;s name when presented with their face has been shown to be selectively damaged in some cases of brain injury, suggesting that naming may be a separate process from being able to produce other information about a person.

===Traumatic brain injury and neurological illness===
Following brain damage, faces can appear severely distorted. A wide variety of distortions can occur — features can droop, enlarge, become discolored, or the entire face can appear to shift relative to the head. This condition is known as prosopometamorphopsia (PMO). In half of the reported cases, distortions are restricted to either the left or the right side of the face, and this form of PMO is called hemi-prosopometamorphopsia (hemi-PMO). Hemi-PMO often results from lesions to the splenium, which connects the right and left hemisphere. In the other half of reported cases, features on both sides of the face appear distorted.

Perceiving facial expressions can involve many areas of the brain, and damaging certain parts of the brain can cause specific impairments in one&#x27;s ability to perceive a face. As stated earlier, research on the impairments caused by brain injury or neurological illness has helped develop our understanding of cognitive processes. The study of prosopagnosia (an impairment in recognizing faces that is usually caused by brain injury) has been particularly helpful in understanding how normal face perception might work. Individuals with prosopagnosia may differ in their abilities to understand faces, and it has been the investigation of these differences which has suggested that several stage theories might be correct.

Brain imaging studies typically show a great deal of activity in an area of the temporal lobe known as the fusiform gyrus, an area also known to cause prosopagnosia when damaged (particularly when damage occurs on both sides). This evidence has led to a particular interest in this area and it is sometimes referred to as the &quot;fusiform face area&quot; (FFA) for that reason.

It is important to note that while certain areas of the brain respond selectively to faces, facial processing involves many neural networks which include visual and emotional processing systems. For example, prosopagnosia patients demonstrate neuropsychological support for a specialized face perception mechanism as these people (due to brain damage) have deficits in facial perception, but their cognitive perception of objects remains intact. The face inversion effect provides behavioral support of a specialized mechanism as people tend to have greater deficits in task performance when prompted to react to an inverted face than to an inverted object.

Electrophysiological support comes from the finding that the N170 and M170 responses tend to be face-specific. Neuro-imaging studies, such as those with PET and fMRI, have shown support for a specialized facial processing mechanism, as they have identified regions of the fusiform gyrus that have higher activation during face perception tasks than other visual perception tasks. Theories about the processes involved in adult face perception have largely come from two sources: research on normal adult face perception and the study of impairments in face perception that are caused by brain injury or neurological illness. Novel optical illusions such as the flashed face distortion effect, in which scientific phenomenology outpaces neurological theory, also provide areas for research.

Difficulties in facial emotion processing can also be seen in individuals with traumatic brain injury, in both diffuse axonal injury and focal brain injury.

==Early development==
Despite numerous studies, there is no widely accepted time-frame in which the average human develops the ability to perceive faces.

===Ability to discern faces from other objects===
Many studies have found that infants will give preferential attention to faces in their visual field, indicating they can discern faces from other objects.
* While newborns will often show particular interest in faces at around three months of age, that preference slowly disappears, re-emerges late during the first year, and slowly declines once more over the next two years of life.
* While newborns show a preference to faces as they grow older (specifically between one and four months of age) this interest can be inconsistent.
* Infants turning their heads towards faces or face-like images suggest rudimentary facial processing capacities.
* The re-emergence of interest in faces at three months is likely influenced by a child&#x27;s motor abilities.

===Ability to detect emotion in the face===

At around seven months of age, infants show the ability to discern faces by emotion. However, whether they have fully developed emotion recognition is unclear. Discerning visual differences in facial expressions is different to understanding the valence of a particular emotion.
* Seven-month-olds seem capable of associating emotional prosodies with facial expressions. When presented with a happy or angry face, followed by an emotionally neutral word read in a happy or angry tone, their event-related potentials follow different patterns. Happy faces followed by angry vocal tones produce more changes than the other incongruous pairing, while there was no such difference between happy and angry congruous pairings. The greater reaction implies that infants held greater expectations of a happy vocal tone after seeing a happy face than an angry tone following an angry face.
* By the age of seven months, children are able to recognize an angry or fearful facial expression, perhaps because of the threat-salient nature of the emotion. Despite this ability, newborns are not yet aware of the emotional content encoded within facial expressions.
* Infants can comprehend facial expressions as social cues representing the feelings of other people before they are a year old. Seven-month-old infants show greater negative central components to angry faces that are looking directly at them than elsewhere, although the gaze of fearful faces produces no difference. In addition, two event-related potentials in the posterior part of the brain are differently aroused by the two negative expressions tested. These results indicate that infants at this age can partially understand the higher level of threat from anger directed at them. They also showed activity in the occipital areas.
* Five-month-olds, when presented with an image of a fearful expression and a happy expression, exhibit similar event-related potentials for both. However, when seven-month-olds are given the same treatment, they focus more on the fearful face. This result indicates increased cognitive focus toward fear that reflects the threat-salient nature of the emotion. Seven-month-olds regard happy and sad faces as distinct emotive categories.
* By seven months, infants are able to use facial expressions to understand others&#x27; behavior. Seven-month-olds look to use facial cues to understand the motives of other people in ambiguous situations, as shown in a study where infants watched the experimenter&#x27;s face longer if the experimenter took a toy from them and maintained a neutral expression, as opposed to if the experimenter made a happy expression. When infants are exposed to faces, it varies depending on factors including facial expression and eye gaze direction.
* Emotions likely play a large role in our social interactions. The perception of a positive or negative emotion on a face affects the way that an individual perceives and processes that face. A face that is perceived to have a negative emotion is processed in a less holistic manner than a face displaying a positive emotion.
* While seven-month-olds have been found to focus more on fearful faces, a study found that &quot;happy expressions elicit enhanced sympathetic arousal in infants&quot; both when facial expressions were presented subliminally and in a way that the infants were consciously aware of the stimulus. Conscious awareness of a stimulus is not connected to an infant&#x27;s reaction.

===Ability to recognize familiar faces===
It is unclear when humans develop the ability to recognize familiar faces. Studies have varying results, and may depend on multiple factors (such as continued exposure to particular faces during a certain time period).
* Early perceptual experience is crucial to the development of adult visual perception, including the ability to identify familiar people and comprehend facial expressions. The capacity to discern between faces, like language, appears to have broad potential in early life that is whittled down to the kinds of faces experienced in early life.
* The neural substrates of face perception in infants are similar to those of adults, but the limits of child-safe imaging technology currently obscure specific information from subcortical areas like the amygdala, which is active in adult facial perception. They also showed activity near the fusiform gyrus,
* Healthy adults likely process faces via a retinotectal (subcortical) pathway.
* Infants can discern between macaque faces at six months of age, but, without continued exposure, cannot do so at nine months of age. If they were shown photographs of macaques during this three-month period, they were more likely to retain this ability.
* Faces &quot;convey a wealth of information that we use to guide our social interactions&quot;. They also found that the neurological mechanisms responsible for face recognition are present by age five. Children process faces is similar to that of adults, but adults process faces more efficiently. The may be because of advancements in memory and cognitive functioning.
* Interest in the social world is increased by interaction with the physical environment. They found that training three-month-old infants to reach for objects with Velcro-covered &quot;sticky mitts&quot; increased the attention they pay to faces compared to moving objects through their hands and control groups.

===Ability to &#x27;mimic&#x27; faces===
A commonly disputed topic is the age at which we can mimic facial expressions.
* Infants as young as two days are capable of mimicking an adult, able to note details like mouth and eye shape as well as move their own muscles to produce similar patterns.
* However, the idea that infants younger than two could mimic facial expressions was disputed by Susan S. Jones, who believed that infants are unaware of the emotional content encoded within facial expressions, and also found they are not able to imitate facial expressions until their second year of life. She also found that mimicry emerged at different ages.

==Neuroanatomy==

=== Key areas of the brain ===

Facial perception has neuroanatomical correlates in the brain.

The fusiform face area (BA37— Brodmann area 37) is located in the lateral fusiform gyrus. It is thought that this area is involved in holistic processing of faces and it is sensitive to the presence of facial parts as well as the configuration of these parts. The fusiform face area is also necessary for successful face detection and identification. This is supported by fMRI activation and studies on prosopagnosia, which involves lesions in the fusiform face area.

The occipital face area is located in the inferior occipital gyrus. Similar to the fusiform face area, this area is also active during successful face detection and identification, a finding that is supported by fMRI and MEG activation. The occipital face area is involved and necessary in the analysis of facial parts but not in the spacing or configuration of facial parts. This suggests that the occipital face area may be involved in a facial processing step that occurs prior to fusiform face area processing.

The superior temporal sulcus is involved in recognition of facial parts and is not sensitive to the configuration of these parts. It is also thought that this area is involved in gaze perception. The superior temporal sulcus has demonstrated increased activation when attending to gaze direction.

During face perception, major activations occur in the extrastriate areas bilaterally, particularly in the above three areas. Perceiving an inverted human face involves increased activity in the inferior temporal cortex, while perceiving a misaligned face involves increased activity in the occipital cortex. No results were found when perceiving a dog face, suggesting a process specific to human faces. Bilateral activation is generally shown in all of these specialized facial areas. However, some studies show increased activation in one side over the other: for instance, the right fusiform gyrus is more important for facial processing in complex situations.

=== BOLD fMRI mapping and the fusiform face area ===
The majority of fMRI studies use blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast to determine which areas of the brain are activated by various cognitive functions.

One study used BOLD fMRI mapping to identify activation in the brain when subjects viewed both cars and faces. They found that the occipital face area, the fusiform face area, the superior temporal sulcus, the amygdala, and the anterior/inferior cortex of the temporal lobe all played roles in contrasting faces from cars, with initial face perception beginning in the fusiform face area and occipital face areas. This entire region forms a network that acts to distinguish faces. The processing of faces in the brain is known as a &quot;sum of parts&quot; perception.

However, the individual parts of the face must be processed first in order to put all of the pieces together. In early processing, the occipital face area contributes to face perception by recognizing the eyes, nose, and mouth as individual pieces.

Researchers also used BOLD fMRI mapping to determine the patterns of activation in the brain when parts of the face were presented in combination and when they were presented singly. The occipital face area is activated by the visual perception of single features of the face, for example, the nose and mouth, and preferred combination of two-eyes over other combinations. This suggests that the occipital face area recognizes the parts of the face at the early stages of recognition.

On the contrary, the fusiform face area shows no preference for single features, because the fusiform face area is responsible for &quot;holistic/configural&quot; information, meaning that it puts all of the processed pieces of the face together in later processing. This is supported by a study which found that regardless of the orientation of a face, subjects were impacted by the configuration of the individual facial features. Subjects were also impacted by the coding of the relationships between those features. This shows that processing is done by a summation of the parts in later stages of recognition.

=== The fusiform gyrus and the amygdala ===
The fusiform gyri are preferentially responsive to faces, whereas the parahippocampal/lingual gyri are responsive to buildings.

While certain areas respond selectively to faces, facial processing involves many neural networks, including visual and emotional processing systems. While looking at faces displaying emotions (especially those with fear facial expressions) compared to neutral faces there is increased activity in the right fusiform gyrus. This increased activity also correlates with increased amygdala activity in the same situations. The emotional processing effects observed in the fusiform gyrus are decreased in patients with amygdala lesions. This demonstrates connections between the amygdala and facial processing areas.

Face familiarity also affects the fusiform gyrus and amygdala activation. Multiple regions activated by similar face components indicates that facial processing is a complex process. Increased brain activation in precuneus and cuneus often occurs when differentiation of two faces are easy (kin and familiar non-kin faces) and the role of posterior medial substrates for visual processing of faces with familiar features (faces averaged with that of a sibling).

The object form topology hypothesis posits a topological organization of neural substrates for object and facial processing. However, there is disagreement: the category-specific and process-map models could accommodate most other proposed models for the neural underpinnings of facial processing.

Most neuroanatomical substrates for facial processing are perfused by the middle cerebral artery. Therefore, facial processing has been studied using measurements of mean cerebral blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral arteries bilaterally. During facial recognition tasks, greater changes occur in the right middle cerebral artery than the left. Men are right-lateralized and women left-lateralized during facial processing tasks.

Just as memory and cognitive function separate the abilities of children and adults to recognize faces, the familiarity of a face may also play a role in the perception of faces. Recording event-related potentials in the brain to determine the timing of facial recognition showed that familiar faces are indicated by a stronger N250, a specific wavelength response that plays a role in the visual memory of faces. Similarly, all faces elicit the N170 response in the brain.

The brain conceptually needs only ~50 neurons to encode any human face, with facial features projected on individual axes (neurons) in a 50-dimensional &quot;Face Space&quot;.

==Cognitive neuroscience==

Cognitive neuroscientists Isabel Gauthier and Michael Tarr are two of the major proponents of the view that face recognition involves expert discrimination of similar objects. Other scientists, in particular Nancy Kanwisher and her colleagues, argue that face recognition involves processes that are face-specific and that are not recruited by expert discriminations in other object classes.

Studies by Gauthier have shown that an area of the brain known as the fusiform gyrus (sometimes called the fusiform face area because it is active during face recognition) is also active when study participants are asked to discriminate between different types of birds and cars, and even when participants become expert at distinguishing computer generated nonsense shapes known as greebles. This suggests that the fusiform gyrus have a general role in the recognition of similar visual objects.

The activity found by Gauthier when participants viewed non-face objects was not as strong as when participants were viewing faces, however this could be because we have much more expertise for faces than for most other objects. Furthermore, not all findings of this research have been successfully replicated, for example, other research groups using different study designs have found that the fusiform gyrus is specific to faces and other nearby regions deal with non-face objects.

However, these findings are difficult to interpret: failures to replicate are null effects and can occur for many different reasons. In contrast, each replication adds a great deal of weight to a particular argument. There are now multiple replications with greebles, with birds and cars, and two unpublished studies with chess experts.

Although expertise sometimes recruits the fusiform face area, a more common finding is that expertise leads to focal category-selectivity in the fusiform gyrus—a pattern similar in terms of antecedent factors and neural specificity to that seen for faces. As such, it remains an open question as to whether face recognition and expert-level object recognition recruit similar neural mechanisms across different subregions of the fusiform or whether the two domains literally share the same neural substrates. At least one study argues that the issue is nonsensical, as multiple measurements of the fusiform face area within an individual often overlap no more with each other than measurements of fusiform face area and expertise-predicated regions.

fMRI studies have asked whether expertise has any specific connection to the fusiform face area in particular, by testing for expertise effects in both the fusiform face area and a nearby but not face-selective region called LOC (Rhodes et al., JOCN 2004; Op de Beeck et al., JN 2006; Moore et al., JN 2006; Yue et al. VR 2006). In all studies, expertise effects are significantly stronger in the LOC than in the fusiform face area, and indeed expertise effects were only borderline significant in the fusiform face area in two of the studies, while the effects were robust and significant in the LOC in all studies.

Therefore, it is still not clear in exactly which situations the fusiform gyrus becomes active, although it is certain that face recognition relies heavily on this area and damage to it can lead to severe face recognition impairment.

== Face advantage in memory recall ==
During face perception, neural networks make connections with the brain to recall memories.

According to the Seminal Model of face perception, there are three stages of face processing:
* recognition of the face
* recall of memories and information linked with that face
* name recall

There are exceptions to this order. For example, names are recalled faster than semantic information in cases of highly familiar stimuli. While the face is a powerful identifier, the voice also helps in recognition.

Research has tested if faces or voices make it easier to identify individuals and recall semantic memory and episodic memory. These experiments looked at all three stages of face processing. The experiment showed two groups of celebrity and familiar faces or voices with a between-group design and asked the participants to recall information about them. The participants were first asked if the stimulus was familiar. If they answered yes then they were asked for information (semantic memory) and memories (episodic memory) that fit the face or voice presented. These experiments demonstrated the phenomenon of face advantage and how it persists through follow-up studies.

===Recognition-performance issue===
After the first experiments on the advantage of faces over voices in memory recall, errors and gaps were found in the methods used.

For one, there was not a clear face advantage for the recognition stage of face processing. Participants showed a familiarity-only response to voices more often than faces. In other words, when voices were recognized (about 60–70% of the time) they were much harder to recall biographical information but very good at being recognized. The results were looked at as remember versus know judgements. A lot more remember results (or familiarity) occurred with voices, and more know (or memory recall) responses happened with faces. This phenomenon persists through experiments dealing with criminal line-ups in prisons. Witnesses are more likely to say that a suspect&#x27;s voice sounded familiar than his/her face even though they cannot remember anything about the suspect. This discrepancy is due to a larger amount of guesswork and false alarms that occur with voices.

To give faces a similar ambiguity to that of voices, the face stimuli were blurred in the follow-up experiment. This experiment followed the same procedures as the first, presenting two groups with sets of stimuli made up of half celebrity faces and half unfamiliar faces. The only difference was that the face stimuli were blurred so that detailed features could not be seen. Participants were then asked to say if they recognized the person, if they could recall specific biographical information about them, and finally if they knew the person&#x27;s name. The results were completely different from those of the original experiment, supporting the view that there were problems in the first experiment&#x27;s methods. According to the results of the followup, the same amount of information and memory could be recalled through voices and faces, dismantling the face advantage. However, these results are flawed and premature because other methodological issues in the experiment still needed to be fixed.

===Content of speech===
The process of controlling the content of speech extract has proven to be more difficult than the elimination of non facial cues in photographs.

Thus the findings of experiments that did not control this factor lead to misleading conclusions regarding the voice recognition over the face recognition. For example, in an experiment it was found that 40% of the time participants could easily pair the celebrity-voice with their occupation just by guessing. In order to eliminate these errors, experimenters removed parts of the voice samples that could possibly give clues to the identity of the target, such as catchphrases. Even after controlling the voice samples as well as the face samples (using blurred faces), studies have shown that semantic information can be more accessible to retrieve when individuals are recognizing faces than voices.

Another technique to control the content of the speech extracts is to present the faces and voices of personally familiar individuals, like the participant&#x27;s teachers or neighbors, instead of the faces and voices of celebrities. In this way alike words are used for the speech extracts. For example, the familiar targets are asked to read exactly the same scripted speech for their voice extracts. The results showed again that semantic information is easier to retrieve when individuals are recognizing faces than voices.

===Frequency-of-exposure issue===
Another factor that has to be controlled in order for the results to be reliable is the frequency of exposure.

If we take the example of celebrities, people are exposed to celebrities&#x27; faces more often than their voices because of the mass media. Through magazines, newspapers and the Internet, individuals are exposed to celebrities&#x27; faces without their voices on an everyday basis rather than their voices without their faces. Thus, someone could argue that for all of the experiments that were done until now the findings were a result of the frequency of exposure to the faces of celebrities rather than their voices.

To overcome this problem researchers decided to use personally familiar individuals as stimuli instead of celebrities. Personally familiar individuals, such as participant&#x27;s teachers, are for the most part heard as well as seen. Studies that used this type of control also demonstrated the face advantage. Students were able to retrieve semantic information more readily when recognizing their teachers faces (both normal and blurred) rather than their voices.

However, researchers over the years have found an even more effective way to control not only the frequency of exposure but also the content of the speech extracts, the associative learning paradigm. Participants are asked to link semantic information as well as names with pre-experimentally unknown voices and faces. In a current experiment that used this paradigm, a name and a profession were given together with, accordingly, a voice, a face or both to three participant groups. The associations described above were repeated four times.

The next step was a cued recall task in which every stimulus that was learned in the previous phase was introduced and participants were asked to tell the profession and the name for every stimulus. Again, the results showed that semantic information can be more accessible to retrieve when individuals are recognizing faces than voices even when the frequency of exposure was controlled.

===Extension to episodic memory and explanation for existence===
Episodic memory is our ability to remember specific, previously experienced events.

In recognition of faces as it pertains to episodic memory, there has been shown to be activation in the left lateral prefrontal cortex, parietal lobe, and the left medial frontal/anterior cingulate cortex. It was also found that a left lateralization during episodic memory retrieval in the parietal cortex correlated strongly with success in retrieval. This may possibly be due to the hypothesis that the link between face recognition and episodic memory were stronger than those of voice and episodic memory. This hypothesis can also be supported by the existence of specialized face recognition devices thought to be located in the temporal lobes.

There is also evidence of the existence of two separate neural systems for face recognition: one for familiar faces and another for newly learned faces. One explanation for this link between face recognition and episodic memory is that since face recognition is a major part of human existence, the brain creates a link between the two in order to be better able to communicate with others.

==Self-face perception==
Though many animals have face-perception capabilities, the recognition of self-face has been observed to be unique to only a few species. There is a particular interest in the study of self-face perception because of its relation to the perceptual integration process.

One study found that the perception/recognition of one&#x27;s own face was unaffected by changing contexts, while the perception/recognition of familiar and unfamiliar faces was adversely affected. Another study that focused on older adults found that they had self-face advantage in configural processing but not featural processing.

In 2014, Motoaki Sugiura developed a conceptual model for self-recognition by breaking it into three categories: the physical, interpersonal, and social selves.

===Mirror test===
Gordon Gallup Jr. developed a technique in 1970 as an attempt to measure self-awareness. This technique is commonly referred to has the mirror test.

The method involves placing a marker on the subject in a place they can not see without a mirror (e.g. ones forehead). The marker must be placed inconspicuously enough that the subject does not become aware that they have been marked. Once the marker is placed, the subject is given access to a mirror. If the subject investigates the mark &quot;(e.g. tries to wipe the mark off)&quot;, this would indicate that the subject understands they are looking at a reflection of themselves, as opposed to perceiving the mirror as an extension of their environment. (e.g., thinking the reflection is another person/animal behind a window)

Though this method is regarded as one of the more effective techniques when it comes to measuring self-awareness, it is certainly not perfect. There are many factors at play that could have an effect on the outcome. For example, if an animal is biologically blind, like a mole, we can not assume that they inherently lack self awareness. It can only be assumed that visual self-recognition, is possibly one of many ways for a living being to be considered as cognitively &quot;self aware&quot;.

==Gender==

Studies using electrophysiological techniques have demonstrated gender-related differences during a face recognition memory task and a facial affect identification task.

In facial perception there was no association to estimated intelligence, suggesting that face recognition in women is unrelated to several basic cognitive processes. Gendered differences may suggest a role for sex hormones. In females there may be variability for psychological functions related to differences in hormonal levels during different phases of the menstrual cycle.

Data obtained in norm and in pathology support asymmetric face processing.

The left inferior frontal cortex and the bilateral occipitotemporal junction may respond equally to all face conditions. Some contend that both the left inferior frontal cortex and the occipitotemporal junction are implicated in facial memory. The right inferior temporal/fusiform gyrus responds selectively to faces but not to non-faces. The right temporal pole is activated during the discrimination of familiar faces and scenes from unfamiliar ones. Right asymmetry in the mid-temporal lobe for faces has also been shown using 133-Xenon measured cerebral blood flow. Other investigators have observed right lateralization for facial recognition in previous electrophysiological and imaging studies.

Asymmetric facial perception implies implementing different hemispheric strategies. The right hemisphere would employ a holistic strategy, and the left an analytic strategy.

A 2007 study, using functional transcranial Doppler spectroscopy, demonstrated that men were right-lateralized for object and facial perception, while women were left-lateralized for facial tasks but showed a right-tendency or no lateralization for object perception. This could be taken as evidence for topological organization of these cortical areas in men. It may suggest that the latter extends from the area implicated in object perception to a much greater area involved in facial perception.

This agrees with the object form topology hypothesis proposed by Ishai. However, the relatedness of object and facial perception was process-based, and appears to be associated with their common holistic processing strategy in the right hemisphere. Moreover, when the same men were presented with facial paradigm requiring analytic processing, the left hemisphere was activated. This agrees with the suggestion made by Gauthier in 2000, that the extrastriate cortex contains areas that are best suited for different computations, and described as the process-map model.

Therefore, the proposed models are not mutually exclusive: facial processing imposes no new constraints on the brain besides those used for other stimuli.

Each stimulus may have been mapped by category into face or non-face, and by process into holistic or analytic. Therefore, a unified category-specific process-mapping system was implemented for either right or left cognitive styles. For facial perception, men likely use a category-specific process-mapping system for right cognitive style, and women use the same for the left.

==Ethnicity==

Differences in own- versus other-race face recognition and perceptual discrimination was first researched in 1914. Humans tend to perceive people of other races than their own to all look alike:

This phenomenon, known as the cross-race effect, is also called the &quot;own-race effect&quot;, &quot;other-race effect&quot;, &quot;own race bias&quot;, or &quot;interracial face-recognition deficit&quot;.

It is difficult to measure the true influence of the cross-race effect.

A 1990 study found that other-race effect is larger among White subjects than among African-American subjects, whereas a 1979 study found the opposite. D. Stephen Lindsay and colleagues note that results in these studies could be due to intrinsic difficulty in recognizing the faces presented, an actual difference in the size of cross-race effect between the two test groups, or some combination of these two factors. Shepherd reviewed studies that found better performance on African-American faces, White faces, and studies where no difference was found.

Overall, Shepherd reported a reliable positive correlation between the size of the effect and the amount of interaction subjects had with members of the other race. This correlation reflects the fact that African-American subjects, who performed equally well on faces of both races in Shepherd&#x27;s study, almost always responded with the highest possible self-rating of amount of interaction with white people, whereas white counterparts displayed a larger other-race effect and reported less other-race interaction. This difference in rating was statistically reliable.

The cross-race effect seems to appear in humans at around six months of age.

=== Challenging the cross-race effect ===
Cross-race effects can be changed through interaction with people of other races. Other-race experience is a major influence on the cross-race effect. A series of studies revealed that participants with greater other-race experience were consistently more accurate at discriminating other-race faces than participants with less experience. Many current models of the effect assume that holistic face processing mechanisms are more fully engaged when viewing own-race faces.

The own-race effect appears related to increased ability to extract information about the spatial relationships between different facial features.

A deficit occurs when viewing people of another race because visual information specifying race takes up mental attention at the expense of individuating information. Further research using perceptual tasks could shed light on the specific cognitive processes involved in the other-race effect. The own-race effect likely extends beyond racial membership into in-group favoritism. Categorizing somebody by the university they attend yields similar results to the own-race effect.

Similarly, men tend to recognize fewer female faces than women do, whereas there are no sex differences for male faces.

If made aware of the own-race effect prior to the experiment, test subjects show significantly less, if any, of the own-race effect.

==Autism==

Autism spectrum disorder is a comprehensive neural developmental disorder that produces social, communicative, and perceptual deficits. Individuals with autism exhibit difficulties with facial identity recognition and recognizing emotional expressions. These deficits are suspected to spring from abnormalities in early and late stages of facial processing.

===Speed and methods===
People with autism process face and non-face stimuli with the same speed.

In non-autistic individuals, a preference for face processing results in a faster processing speed in comparison to non-face stimuli. These individuals use holistic processing when perceiving faces. In contrast, individuals with autism employ part-based processing or bottom-up processing, focusing on individual features rather than the face as a whole. People with autism direct their gaze primarily to the lower half of the face, specifically the mouth, varying from the eye-trained gaze of non autistic people. This deviation does not employ the use of facial prototypes, which are templates stored in memory that make for easy retrieval.

Additionally, individuals with autism display difficulty with recognition memory, specifically memory that aids in identifying faces. The memory deficit is selective for faces and does not extend to other visual input. These face-memory deficits are possibly products of interference between face-processing regions.

===Associated difficulties===
Autism often manifests in weakened social ability, due to decreased eye contact, joint attention, interpretation of emotional expression, and communicative skills.

These deficiencies can be seen in infants as young as nine months. Some experts use &#x27;face avoidance&#x27; to describe how infants who are later diagnosed with autism preferentially attend to non-face objects. Furthermore, some have proposed that autistic children&#x27;s difficulty in grasping the emotional content of faces is the result of a general inattentiveness to facial expression, and not an incapacity to process emotional information in general.

The constraints are viewed to cause impaired social engagement. Furthermore, research suggests a link between decreased face processing abilities in individuals with autism and later deficits in theory of mind. While typically developing individuals are able to relate others&#x27; emotional expressions to their actions, individuals with autism do not demonstrate this skill to the same extent.

This causation, however, resembles the chicken or the egg dispute. Some theorize that social impairment leads to perceptual problems. In this perspective, a biological lack of social interest inhibits facial recognition due to under-use.

=== Neurology ===
Many of the obstacles that individuals with autism face in terms of facial processing may be derived from abnormalities in the fusiform face area and amygdala.

Typically, the fusiform face area in individuals with autism has reduced volume. This volume reduction has been attributed to deviant amygdala activity that does not flag faces as emotionally salient, and thus decreases activation levels.

Studies are not conclusive as to which brain areas people with autism use instead. One found that, when looking at faces, people with autism exhibit activity in brain regions normally active when non-autistic individuals perceive objects. Another found that during facial perception, people with autism use different neural systems, each using their own unique neural circuitry.

===Compensation mechanisms===
As autistic individuals age, scores on behavioral tests assessing ability to perform face-emotion recognition increase to levels similar to controls.

The recognition mechanisms of these individuals are still atypical, though often effective. In terms of face identity-recognition, compensation can include a more pattern-based strategy, first seen in face inversion tasks. Alternatively, older individuals compensate by using mimicry of others&#x27; facial expressions and rely on their motor feedback of facial muscles for face emotion-recognition.

== Schizophrenia ==

Schizophrenia is known to affect attention, perception, memory, learning, processing, reasoning, and problem solving.

Schizophrenia has been linked to impaired face and emotion perception. People with schizophrenia demonstrate worse accuracy and slower response time in face perception tasks in which they are asked to match faces, remember faces, and recognize which emotions are present in a face. People with schizophrenia have more difficulty matching upright faces than they do with inverted faces. A reduction in configural processing, using the distance between features of an item for recognition or identification (e.g. features on a face such as eyes or nose), has also been linked to schizophrenia.

Schizophrenia patients are able to easily identify a &quot;happy&quot; affect but struggle to identify faces as &quot;sad&quot; or &quot;fearful&quot;. Impairments in face and emotion perception are linked to impairments in social skills, due to the individual&#x27;s inability to distinguish facial emotions. People with schizophrenia tend to demonstrate a reduced N170 response, atypical face scanning patterns, and a configural processing dysfunction. The severity of schizophrenia symptoms has been found to correlate with the severity of impairment in face perception.

Individuals with diagnosed schizophrenia and antisocial personality disorder have been found to have even more impairment in face and emotion perception than individuals with just schizophrenia. These individuals struggle to identify anger, surprise, and disgust. There is a link between aggression and emotion perception difficulties for people with this dual diagnosis.

Data from magnetic resonance imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging has shown that a smaller volume of the fusiform gyrus is linked to greater impairments in face perception.

There is a positive correlation between self-face recognition and other-face recognition difficulties in individuals with schizophrenia. The degree of schizotypy has also been shown to correlate with self-face difficulties, unusual perception difficulties, and other face recognition difficulties. Schizophrenia patients report more feelings of strangeness when looking in a mirror than do normal controls. Hallucinations, somatic concerns, and depression have all been found to be associated with self-face perception difficulties.

==Other animals==
Neurobiologist Jenny Morton and her team have been able to teach sheep to choose a familiar face over unfamiliar one when presented with two photographs, which has led to the discovery that sheep can recognize human faces. Archerfish (distant relatives of humans) were able to differentiate between forty-four different human faces, which supports the theory that there is no need for a neocortex or a history of discerning human faces in order to do so. Pigeons were found to use the same parts of the brain as humans do to distinguish between happy and neutral faces or male and female faces.

==Artificial intelligence==

Much effort has gone into developing software that can recognize human faces.

This work has occurred in a branch of artificial intelligence known as computer vision, which uses the psychology of face perception to inform software design. Recent breakthroughs use noninvasive functional transcranial Doppler spectroscopy to locate specific responses to facial stimuli. The new system uses input responses, called &quot;cortical long-term potentiation&quot;, to trigger target face search from a computerized face database system. Such a system provides for brain-machine interface for facial recognition, referred to as &quot;cognitive biometrics&quot;.

Another application is estimating age from images of faces. Compared with other cognition problems, age estimation from facial images is challenging, mainly because the aging process is influenced by many external factors like physical condition and living style.The aging process is also slow, making sufficient data difficult to collect.

===Nemrodov===
In 2016, Dan Nemrodov conducted multivariate analyses of EEG signals that might be involved in identity related information and applied pattern classification to event-related potential signals both in time and in space. The main target of the study were:

# evaluating whether previously known event-related potential components such as N170 and others are involved in individual face recognition or not
# locating temporal landmarks of individual level recognition from event-related potential signals
# figuring out the spatial profile of individual face recognition

For the experiment, conventional event-related potential analyses and pattern classification of event-related potential signals were conducted given preprocessed EEG signals.

This and a further study showed the existence of a spatio-temporal profile of individual face recognition process and reconstruction of individual face images was possible by utilizing such profile and informative features that contribute to encoding of identity related information.

== Genetic basis ==
While many cognitive abilities, such as general intelligence, have a clear genetic basis, evidence for the genetic basis of facial recognition is fairly recent. Current evidence suggests that facial recognition abilities are highly linked to genetic, rather than environmental, bases.

Early research focused on genetic disorders which impair facial recognition abilities, such as Turner syndrome, which results in impaired amygdala functioning. A 2003 study found significantly poorer facial recognition abilities in individuals with Turner syndrome, suggesting that the amygdala impacts face perception.

Evidence for a genetic basis in the general population, however, comes from twin studies in which the facial recognition scores on the Cambridge Face Memory test were twice as similar for monozygotic twins in comparison to dizygotic twins. This finding was supported by studies which found a similar difference in facial recognition scores and those which determined the heritability of facial recognition to be approximately 61%.

There was no significant relationship between facial recognition scores and other cognitive abilities, most notably general object recognition. This suggests that facial recognition abilities are heritable, and have a genetic basis independent from other cognitive abilities. Research suggests that more extreme examples of facial recognition abilities, specifically hereditary prosopagnosics, are highly genetically correlated.

For hereditary prosopagnosics, an autosomal dominant model of inheritance has been proposed. Research also correlated the probability of hereditary prosopagnosia with the single nucleotide polymorphisms along the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR), suggesting that these alleles serve a critical role in normal face perception. Mutation from the wild type allele at these loci has also been found to result in other disorders in which social and facial recognition deficits are common, such as autism spectrum disorder, which may imply that the genetic bases for general facial recognition are complex and polygenic.

This relationship between OXTR and facial recognition is also supported by studies of individuals who do not have hereditary prosopagnosia.

== Social perceptions of faces ==
People make rapid judgements about others based on facial appearance. Some judgements are formed very quickly and accurately, with adults correctly categorising the sex of adult faces with only a 75ms exposure and with near 100% accuracy. The accuracy of some other judgements are less easily confirmed, though there is evidence that perceptions of health made from faces are at least partly accurate, with health judgements reflecting fruit and vegetable intake, body fat and BMI. People also form judgements about others&#x27; personalities from their faces, and there is evidence of at least partial accuracy in this domain too.

=== Valence-dominance model ===
The valence-dominance model of face recognition is a widely cited model that suggests that the social judgements made of faces can be summarised into two dimensions: valence (positive-negative) and dominance (dominant-submissive). A recent large-scale multi-country replication project largely supported this model across different world regions, though found that a potential third dimension may also be important in some regions and other research suggests that the valence-dominance model also applies to social perceptions of bodies.

<text>John Joseph Sweeney (May 5, 1934 – February 1, 2021) was an American labor leader who served as president of the AFL–CIO from 1995 to 2009.

==Early years==
Born in The Bronx, New York, Sweeney was the son of James, a city bus driver, and Agnes, a domestic worker, both Irish immigrants. Sweeney&#x27;s family moved to Yonkers in 1944, where Sweeney attended St. Barnabas Elementary School and graduated from Cardinal Hayes High School. Sweeney&#x27;s father took him to numerous union meetings, and it was there that Sweeney began his lifelong commitment to the American labor movement.

Sweeney enrolled at Iona College in New Rochelle in 1952. Sweeney worked as a grave-digger and building porter to pay his tuition, and joined his first union at this time. In 1956, he graduated with a degree in economics.

==Union career with ILGWU and SEIU==

After graduation, Sweeney became a clerk at IBM. But his commitment to the labor movement led Sweeney to take a two-thirds cut in pay to become a researcher with the International Ladies Garment Workers Union in 1956 (now UNITE HERE).

In time, Sweeney met Thomas R. Donahue, then a union representative with the Building Service Employees International Union (BSEIU, now the Service Employees International Union or SEIU). Donahue asked Sweeney to leave the ILGWU, and he became a contract director with BSEIU Local 32B in 1960. BSEIU changed its name to the Services Employees International Union in 1968. In 1972, Sweeney became assistant to the president of Local 32B in addition to his existing duties as contract director. He was elected to the executive board of Local 32B the same year. In 1973, Sweeney was elected vice president of the local.

In 1976, John Sweeney was elected president of Local 32B. He resigned his position as contract director. Three months after taking office, Sweeney led the 45,000 members of SEIU out on a surprise strike against the New York Realty Advisory Board a day before the union&#x27;s contract was due to expire. After 17 days, the union won a new contract with significant wage and benefit increases. In 1977, Sweeney merged Local 32B with Local 32J to form Local 32BJ. In 1979, Sweeney led the maintenance workers of Local 32BJ out on strike again, and won additional contract improvements.

In 1980, Sweeney was elected president of the national SEIU. Sweeney continued to serve as president of Local 32BJ until mid-1981, and drew a salary as a consultant to the local until 1995. Under Sweeney&#x27;s tenure, SEIU made rapid gains in membership. The union began the decade with about 625,000 members. However, Sweeney began pushing for rapid expansion into new sectors and base areas. SEIU joined with the National Association of Working Women to organize office workers, and the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) to organize nursing home workers. The union also dramatically expanded its reach among maintenance workers in the health care field and business offices.

Sweeney also pushed for mergers with a number of other unions, absorbing the National Association of Government Employees (NAGE) and other public employee unions.

By 1993, SEIU had more than one million members. It was the first AFL–CIO union to reach the million-member mark in more than 20 years. But while Sweeney had emphasized the organization of new members, about half of its growth had come through merger. Sweeney initiated other changes at SEIU as well. The union began pushing for stronger federal laws in the area of health and safety, sexual harassment, and civil and immigrant rights. It also advocated for legally-mandated paid family leave, health care reform and a raise in the minimum wage. Internally, Sweeney devoted nearly a third of the union&#x27;s budget to organizing new members and pushed for stronger diversity in the union&#x27;s ranks.

==1995 campaign for presidency of the AFL–CIO==
In 1995, Sweeney and a small group of other national union presidents approached AFL–CIO president Lane Kirkland and asked that he retire. Dissatisfaction with Kirkland&#x27;s leadership had grown in the early 1990s. There were a number of issues: Failure to pass labor law reform in President Bill Clinton&#x27;s first term, failure to stop the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), failure to achieve health care reform, failure to pass legislation banning the permanent replacement of strikers, and failure to shift public discourse in a more liberal, pro-union direction. The fact that Kirkland was traveling in Europe while the U.S. Senate was considering the ban on permanent replacements was seen as all too indicative of his real priorities. Most frustrating of all was Kirkland&#x27;s lackluster response to the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994. He seemed blatantly uninterested, even hostile, to plans calling for a more aggressive political program.

===Opposition===
The opposition to Kirkland came to a head at the mid-winter AFL–CIO executive council meeting in Bal Harbour, Florida, February 19–20, 1995. Since the start of the new year, Sweeney had twice held meetings with Kirkland to tell him that key members of the executive council were disappointed with his leadership and that he should step down in favor of secretary-treasurer Thomas R. Donahue.

The weekend before the executive council meeting, 11 union presidents on the executive council agreed to form a &quot;Committee for Change&quot;. The group was committed to removing Kirkland as president of the AFL–CIO. The group included Sweeney; Gerald McEntee of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME); Owen Bieber of the United Auto Workers (UAW); George Becker of the United Steelworkers of America (USWA); Ron Carey of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT); Arthur Coia of the Laborers&#x27; International Union of North America (LIUNA); Wayne Glenn of the United Paperworkers International Union (UPIU); Frank Hanley of the International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE); George Kourpias of the International Association of Machinists (IAM); Sigurd Lucassen of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America (UBC); and Richard Trumka of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). Together, these unions had sufficient votes to remove Kirkland at the October AFL–CIO convention and elect a new president.

The first choice of the Committee for Change was AFL–CIO secretary-treasurer Thomas R. Donahue, who had developed a reputation as an effective innovator. He had lobbied for the creation of an AFL–CIO committee to examine changes in the workplace, pioneered the federation&#x27;s communication efforts (including the construction of a television studio at AFL–CIO headquarters) and led the campaign against NAFTA. But Donahue refused to challenge a man whom he had served loyally for nearly 16 years.

Kirkland refused to resign or retire. The executive council meeting turned rancorous. The dissident members of the executive council argued for a change in leadership and policy. But Kirkland pointed to his administration&#x27;s policies and initiatives and claimed that the dissidents were disloyal and power-hungry.

On May 8, 1995, Donahue announced he was resigning as secretary-treasurer effective at the October AFL–CIO convention. The next day, Kirkland announced he was running for re-election.

The Committee for Change decided to run its own candidate against Kirkland. McEntee was considered too abrasive and had aggressively pursued disputes with other unions to be a consensus candidate. Trumka was considered too young and too militant. In contrast, Sweeney had a reassuring demeanor, an amiable personality and many friends on the executive council. He also would be seen as the &quot;organizing candidate&quot; the group wanted.

The group also agreed to nominate Trumka as secretary-treasurer of the AFL–CIO. The group also proposed to create a new office, that of executive vice-president, charged with mobilizing state federations and central labor councils and reaching out to minorities and women. The new position was also a way of ensuring that there would be an executive position which could be filled with a woman or a minority, thus gaining additional political support for the dissidents. The Committee for Change recruited Linda Chavez-Thompson, a member of the AFL–CIO executive council, a vice-president of AFSCME and an activist on the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement.

On June 13, the Committee formally announced its slate of candidates and the name of its platform, &quot;A New Voice for American Workers&quot;. The slate of candidates became known as the &quot;New Voice&quot; slate. Shortly thereafter, 10 more unions announced their opposition to Kirkland&#x27;s re-election. Now a total of 21 unions representing 56 percent of the delegates to the convention were opposed to Kirkland&#x27;s presidency.

Faced with such discouraging numbers, Kirkland announced that he would resign effective August 1.

With Kirkland&#x27;s resignation, the principal reason for Donahue&#x27;s reluctance to run for president disappeared. The same day as Kirkland&#x27;s announcement, Donahue withdrew his retirement announcement and said he would now run for the presidency of the AFL–CIO.

In the interim, however, support for Donahue among the dissident unions (which had changed its name to the &quot;New Voice&quot; slate) had dissipated.

At the August AFL–CIO executive council meeting, Donahue was elected by unanimous vote as the new AFL–CIO president. For the office of secretary-treasurer, the council elected Barbara Easterling, secretary-treasurer of the Communication Workers of America. Easterling announced that she would run with Donahue in October.

Opposition to the New Voice slate was led by the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and Communication Workers of America (CWA). AFT president Albert Shanker argued that the dissidents should have brought their concerns before the executive council, where, after discussion and deliberation, a decision about Kirkland&#x27;s fate could have been made. Shanker also argued that exposing the labor movement&#x27;s internal disputes to labor&#x27;s enemies seriously risked weakening the labor movement. Finally, Shanker argued that the New Voice slate&#x27;s attempt to mobilize state and local labor bodies in favor of one candidate risked politicizing the AFL–CIO and destabilizing it in the long run.

The New Voice group, however, understood that their only hope for success was to move the debate out of the executive council. In the executive council, each union—no matter how small—had an equal vote. A group of 20 small unions could make binding decisions even though their membership might be far less than that of their opponents. But at the AFL–CIO convention, each union was allotted delegates proportional to the size of its membership. At the convention, a coalition of large unions could triumph even if they did not represent a majority of unions. It would have been foolish for the New Voice slate, whose base was in some of the largest unions in the AFL–CIO, to pursue their goals in the executive council where their votes counted for less.

A public debate over the AFL–CIO&#x27;s future had rarely been seen in the history of the American labor movement. The New Voice ticket campaigned intensively for the support of the state federations and central labor councils (CLCs), each of which was entitled to send one delegate to the convention. Normally, few of these bodies sent delegates to the quadrennial convention. But New Voice slate actively recruited delegates, and allegations were made that the slate had agreed to pay travel and housing for delegates if they agreed to support Sweeney. Sweeney also promised that more attention would be paid to these bodies, which the New Voice ticket saw as important in supporting local labor actions and enlarging the federation&#x27;s political capabilities. Donahue refused to campaign for votes among the state federations and central labor councils, arguing that it would politicize the AFL-CIO and weaken the post-election consensus among the AFL–CIO&#x27;s various bodies.

By August, it was clear that the New Voice slate would win at least two-thirds of the state federation and CLC votes. Donahue reversed his decision and campaigned for votes among these delegates, but his action came too late: Most of the votes were already locked up.

Both sides hired professional public relations firms to help manage their campaigns, which included media strategies, slogans, graphics, leaflets, press releases, T-shirts, opposition research, posters and videotaped speeches. The candidates also used &#x27;free&#x27; media extensively, appearing on &#x27;Meet the Press,&#x27; National Public Radio&#x27;s &#x27;Talk of the Nation,&#x27; the Public Broadcasting Service&#x27;s &#x27;MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour,&#x27; C-SPAN and other shows.

Despite Donahue&#x27;s energetic campaigning, it soon became clear that his candidacy was profoundly limited by his ties to the Kirkland regime. Donahue was forced to defend the status quo and deny the magnitude of the labor movement&#x27;s problems when he believed otherwise.

The New Voice political platform persuaded many unions to abandon the status quo. Sweeney called for a major expansion of the federation&#x27;s role in organizing by: spending $20 million a year on hiring and training thousands of new organizers; mobilizing over 1,000 college students for summer organizing; creating a &quot;Sunbelt Organizing Fund&quot; to sponsor organizing in the South and Southwest; and establishing a separate Organizing Department. Sweeney also proposed creating a Center for Strategic Campaigns to coordinate all national contract campaigns; creating a Strategic Campaign Fund to provide grants to unions in difficult organizing and contract fights; creating a Strike Support Team of organizers that could be deployed to help support strikes; and establishing a Pension Investment Clearinghouse to provide information on how pensions are invested and to help mobilize investments in support of organizing. Sweeney also called for a modification of labor&#x27;s political tactics and withdrawal of support for Democrats who did not support labor&#x27;s agenda. Sweeney recommended creating a National Labor Political Training Center to recruit and train candidates and political campaign directors, and establishing a Labor Center for Economic and Public Policy that would develop policy analysis, support the federation&#x27;s legislative agenda and expand the political activities of the state federations and central labor councils.

Finally, Sweeney argued that it was time to revamp the AFL–CIO itself. The New Voice platform promised more effective consultation with state federations and central labor councils, better ties with women and minority groups, expansion of the executive council to insure more women and minority representation, creation of the office of executive vice-president, annual meetings of the general board, restructuring of the trade and industrial departments and a rule that no one over the age of 70 could run for any executive office.

Partly in response to the New Voice platform and partly because he believed change was, in fact, needed, Donahue began to implement some of the New Voice reforms. He diverted revenue from the Union Privilege program into a new organizing fund that would eventually pay out $20 million a year. He increased the budget of the Organizing Institute, approved plans to double the number of organizers recruited and trained each year, and obtained executive council approval to provide no-interest loans to support striking unions. Donahue also diverted Union Privilege money to train 500 activists to work in the 1996 congressional elections.

At the AFL–CIO convention in New York City, a record-breaking 1,047 delegates gathered to determine the AFL–CIO&#x27;s future. When the votes were finally counted on October 25, 1995, John Sweeney had secured the support of 34 unions representing 7,286,837 members, or 57 percent of the AFL–CIO&#x27;s membership. As a result of New Voice efforts, the number of delegates from state federation and local central labor councils rose from 186 at the 1993 convention to 488 in 1995.

The New Voice ticket then asked the convention to implement its platform. Subsequently, the convention voted to provide state federations with representation on the AFL–CIO general board, which had previously been open only to national union presidents. The convention also expanded the AFL–CIO executive council from 33 to 54 members. Sweeney offered these new seats to previously unrepresented unions. The expansion nearly doubled representation for women and minorities on the council. The expansion had the added advantage of enabling both Sweeney supporters and Donahue loyalists to sit on the council, encouraging reconciliation. A &#x27;unity slate&#x27; of executive council members was announced by Douglas H. Dority, president of the UFCW and a key Donahue supporter, and Gerald McEntee. The unity slate helped avoid the threat of disaffiliations from the labor federation.

==First decade in office==

===Structural changes===
Soon after taking office, Sweeney initiated several programs intended to reverse the decline in union membership and recruit more new members, especially younger people. The AFL–CIO&#x27;s organizing and field mobilization programs were separated. The Field Mobilization department was given control over the AFL–CIO&#x27;s regional offices, which were reduced from 12 to four. Sweeney set a goal of spending one-third of the federation&#x27;s budget on organizing by 1998. An ad hoc executive council committee was established to come up with an organizing strategy for the South and Southwest, while the Union Summer program was established to recruit and deploy college-age activists. A new department, the Working Women&#x27;s Department, was created and charged with developing ways to give working women a voice and to inject that voice into the labor movement&#x27;s deliberations.

Two new centers were also established. The new political training center&#x27;s mission was to train political operatives and assist affiliates in training their staff in political work. The transnational corporate research center&#x27;s mission was to help unions in organizing and/or contract battles with international corporations.

In August 1996, Sweeney created a Corporate Affairs Department. The department included three new centers: the Center for Workplace Democracy (to deal with labor-management partnerships), the Center for Worker Ownership and Governance (to deal with pension and investment issues) and the Center for Strategic Research (to assist affiliates with research in comprehensive campaigns). The department also was given responsibility for collecting statistics and conducting research on collective bargaining.

In May 1997, Sweeney announced four new organizing programs. The first program was an AFL–CIO-based effort to provide logistical, organizational and training support for state and local unions which wanted to create organizing programs. The second program &#x27;Senior Summer&#x27;, a program to leverage the labor movement&#x27;s retirees by training retired workers in organizing and political operations. The third program was the &quot;Union Cities&quot; effort to encourage large central labor councils to be more active and effective, and to encourage smaller CLCs to merge or work more closely to enhance their influence. Lastly, the &#x27;Street Heat&#x27; program funneled funds and staff to CLCs and unions so that they could develop rapid-response teams of union members to picket and/or protest when workers were intimidated, coerced or fired.

In October 1998, Sweeney renamed the AFL–CIO&#x27;s 30-year-old Human Resources Development Institute (HRDI). It was now known as the Working for America Institute. Instead of focusing on education and training for displaced workers, the department&#x27;s new mission was to promote economic development, act as a think-tank and policy development foundation, and lobby Congress on economic policy.

===Brewing unrest===
But dissatisfaction began to build once again within the AFL–CIO. The elimination of a number of constitutional and administrative departments, such as the Industrial Union Department, was seen as a strike against those unions which had not supported Sweeney. The directorship of the AFL–CIO Organizing Department was a revolving door, organization of new members had not markedly increased and many unions had taken to raiding one another to increase membership. A number of unions were unhappy with what they saw as AFL–CIO criticism of their organizing programs.

On March 15 2000, the United Transportation Union disaffiliated from the AFL–CIO over a jurisdictional dispute. It was followed in March 2001 by the Carpenters union, which claimed that Sweeney&#x27;s organizing efforts had failed and that the AFL-CIO structure must be abandoned.

Despite substantial investment in politics, the AFL–CIO had not succeeded in restoring the Democrats to a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Some union presidents began to argue that the AFL–CIO should stop spending money on political causes and divert resources to organizing new members. Prominent among the dissatisfied leaders was Andrew Stern, president of SEIU and a Sweeney protege.

The growing unrest within the AFL–CIO became public when Sweeney announced on September 18, 2003, that he planned to run for another four-year term at the federation convention in the summer of 2005. When Sweeney had first been elected of the AFL–CIO in 1995, he had proposed a constitutional amendment which would bar anyone 70 years of age or older from seeking executive office. The proposed amendment was never acted on, but Sweeney promised the convention he would not remain in office beyond the age limit he had proposed.

==2005 campaign for presidency of the AFL–CIO==
===New Unity Partnership===
Shortly after the March 2004 executive council meeting, Andrew Stern announced the formation of the New Unity Partnership (NUP). Joining Stern were the presidents of UNITE HERE, the Teamsters, the Laborers, UFCW and the Carpenters. Stern had begun working with these union leaders in the fall of 2003 to create a set of principles to reform the labor movement. Although NUP&#x27;s existence had been revealed in October 2003, the group did not announce its platform until March 2004.

===Platforms===
The NUP platform included a number of proposals. First, the AFL–CIO should mandate the merger of smaller unions with larger ones, and the AFL–CIO must redraw and enforce jurisdictional lines along those of major industries, or &quot;core jurisdictions&quot;. Second, a number of AFL–CIO departments (including health and safety, education, and civil and human rights) must be merged or eliminated. Third, political spending must be significantly reduced in favor of major new AFL–CIO spending on organizing.

Sweeney told the press he would initiate an internal discussion of Stern&#x27;s views after the November 2004 presidential election, with a goal of creating a proposal by July 2005. But Stern declared that this would be too late for consideration at the AFL–CIO&#x27;s biennial convention.

===Implementation of criticisms===
At the August 2004 AFL–CIO executive council meeting, Sweeney attempted to implement some of NUP&#x27;s criticisms by announcing the formation of a task force to investigate organizing the Wal-Mart grocery and discount department store chain. Sweeney also announced the creation of an Immigrant Worker Project to oversee the federation&#x27;s work on immigrant rights and organizing efforts.

On November 10, 2004, Sweeney announced a process and timeline for considering reform of the AFL–CIO. Sweeney said he would chair a committee composed of the federation&#x27;s 25-member executive committee which would make reform recommendations to the February 2005 AFL–CIO executive council meeting.

===New Unity Partnership: 2005===
In January 2005, Stern announced that the New Unity Partnership had disbanded. Its purpose had been to create discussion over the future of the labor movement, Stern said, and that goal had been accomplished.

At the March 2005 AFL–CIO executive council meeting, however, no consensus on reform emerged. Instead, the executive committee of the AFL–CIO recommended that the federation earmark half of all income for political and legislative mobilization. The executive committee also recommended rebating up to millions of dollars to unions which spent at least 30 percent of their budget on organizing. There appeared to be little support in the executive committee for mandatory mergers.

But several former New Unity Partnership members disagreed with these proposals. The Teamsters demanded a 50 percent of dues to member unions, as well as streamlining the AFL–CIO by moving many of its functions out of the headquarters to the state and local field operations, eliminating other functions, and reducing the size of the executive committee.

In May 2005, Sweeney formally submitted the executive council&#x27;s proposals to the AFL–CIO convention for consideration in July.

On June 16, Stern and his allies announced the formation of a new organization, the Change to Win Coalition. The Change to Win Coalition included five unions: SEIU, UFCW, the Laborers, UNITE HERE and the Teamsters. They were joined by the Carpenters on June 27. The Change to Win Coalition released a set of proposals for reforming the AFL-CIO that largely reflected its member union&#x27;s proposals.

In mid-June, the AFL–CIO executive council voted to submit Sweeney&#x27;s reform plan to the AFL–CIO convention in July. Discussion on the outstanding proposals from the February meeting continued, but no consensus was reached.

Additional counter-proposals were proposed throughout the summer. The Change to Win Coalition union presidents sought and received authority from their governing bodies to disaffiliate from the AFL–CIO, but it became clear that the Change to Win coalition could muster only a third of delegates at the AFL–CIO convention.

On July 22, 2005, the United Farm Workers (UFW) joined the Change to Win Coalition.

===A contentious convention: 2005===
On July 25, 2005, as the AFL–CIO convention got under way, SEIU and the Teamsters announced that the negotiations had failed and that they were disaffiliating from the AFL–CIO. The same day, SEIU, the Teamsters, UFCW and UNITE HERE announced that their delegates would boycott the AFL–CIO convention.

Sweeney angrily denounced the disaffiliations. Gerald McEntee called the disaffiliation threats a power-play, claiming that the Change to Win coalition had demanded that Sweeney announce his retirement within six months and endorse a replacement of their choosing.

With the Change to Win unions boycotting the AFL–CIO convention, Sweeney&#x27;s re-election and the adoption of his reform plans became a foregone conclusion.

On July 29, UFCW disaffiliated from the AFL–CIO, bringing the total number of members lost to 4.6 million of the AFL–CIO&#x27;s 13 million members.

On September 13, the 450,000-member union UNITE HERE voted to disaffiliate from the AFL–CIO.

The breakaway unions officially formed a new labor federation, Change to Win, on September 27, 2005.

Both Sweeney and Change to Win reached out to one another after the break-up of the AFL–CIO, although the relationship was difficult. Sweeney primarily focused on stabilizing the AFL–CIO and its state, area and local bodies financially, structurally and politically. Sweeney kept a relatively low profile, seeking the spotlight only during disputes with Change to Win or when addressing national issues such as immigration policy.

Sweeney retired as President of the AFL–CIO on September 16, 2009, and became President Emeritus. He won the &quot;Roving Ambassador for Peace&quot; award from the World Peace Prize Awarding Council in 2016, because of his long-standing devotion to social justice and fair employment opportunities for American workers.

==Personal life==
Sweeney co-edited a study about the labor movement and co-wrote two books about unions, including &quot;America Needs a Raise: Fighting for Economic Security and Social Justice&quot;. He was married to Maureen Power, a former schoolteacher, and lived with her in Bethesda, Maryland. He had two children, John (an information technology professional) and Patricia (who owns a site selection company, Sweeney Contract Solutions, LLC), and a granddaughter, Kennedy. He was also a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.

Sweeney&#x27;s hobbies included golf and bowling. He died on February 1, 2021, at his home in Bethesda at the age of 86.

<doc id="485315" wikidata="Q6071469" url="?curid=485315" title="Irish declension">
<text>The [[declension]] of Irish nouns, the definite article, and the adjectives is discussed on this page (for pronouns, see Irish Grammar).

==Nouns==
===Gender===
Nouns in Irish are divided into two genders, masculine and feminine; the Old Irish neuter gender no longer exists. While gender should be learned when the specific noun is learned, there are some guidelines that can be followed:

Generally, nouns in singular form ending with broad consonants are masculine, while those ending in a slender consonant are feminine.

There are some exceptions, mostly dealing with specific endings and suffixes; for example, words ending in and (with a slender and respectively) are categorically masculine, while words ending in (with a broad ) are feminine. This leads to some unexpected gender assignments, such as &quot;boy scout&quot; being feminine, and &quot;girl&quot; masculine (the diminutive suffix is always masculine irrespective of the noun it applies to).

===Case===
Irish has four cases: common (usually called the nominative, but it covers the role of the accusative as well), vocative, genitive, and the dative or prepositional case.

====Nominative====
The nominative is used in the following functions:
# Sentence subject
#: &quot;The cat is drinking.&quot;
# Sentence object
#: &quot;Seán broke the window.&quot;
# Predicate of the copula
#: &quot;He is an idiot.&quot;
# Object of the prepositions &quot;without&quot;, &quot;(up) to&quot; and &quot;like, as&quot;.
#: &quot;without the money&quot;
#: &quot;(up) to the time&quot;
#: &quot;like the hen&quot;

====Vocative====
The vocative is used in direct address, and is always preceded by the particle , which triggers lenition (the vocative particle is not pronounced before a vowel sound). The first declension is the only declension in which the vocative is distinct from the nominative.
* &quot;Where are you, son?&quot;
* &quot;Seán, come here!&quot;

====Genitive====
The genitive indicates possession and material of composition:
* &quot;the man&#x27;s hat&quot;
* &quot;the woman&#x27;s children&quot;
* &quot;the bishop&#x27;s candelabras&quot;
* &quot;a ring of gold, a golden ring&quot;
* &quot;shoes of leather, leather shoes&quot;

The object of a verbal noun also requires the genitive:
* &quot;(the act of) spending money&quot;

The object of a compound preposition is in the genitive. Formally, these prepositions are actually prepositional phrases.
* &quot;behind the door&quot; (lit. &quot;on the back of the door&quot;)
* &quot;one month long&quot; (lit. &quot;for the duration of one month&quot;)
* &quot;for Ireland&#x27;s sake&quot;

====Dative/Prepositional====
The dative/prepositional is used as the object of most simple prepositions except and . In standard language, the dative is almost always identical to the nominative. Some dialects, however, have distinct standalone datives in the second and fifth declensions. In the standard language, only two words (&quot;Ireland&quot;) and (&quot;twenty&quot;) have distinct datives - and , respectively. They are also found in certain fixed phrases with nouns of the second declension, such as (&quot;above&quot;, lit. &quot;over head&quot; – is the old dative of (&quot;head&quot;)).
* &quot;at the father&quot;
* &quot;out of the house&quot;
* &quot;on the bread&quot;
* &quot;in an orange&quot;
* &quot;to hell&quot;
* &quot;with the money&quot;
* &quot;from Ireland&quot;

===Declension===
There are five recognized declensions in Irish. The makeup of the declensions depends on three factors:
# the gender of the noun
# the formation of the genitive singular
# relation of genitive singular to nominative plural

The following chart describes the characteristics of each declension class:
====First====
The first declension is made up of masculine nouns. The nominative singular ends in a broad consonant, which is made slender in the genitive singular. The most common formation of the plural has the opposite pattern: the nominative ends in a slender consonant, the genitive in a broad consonant (these plurals are known as weak plurals in comparison with strong plurals which maintain identical endings for all cases in the plural). The dative is identical to the nominative in both numbers, although an obsolete dative plural in is still sometimes encountered in old-fashioned literary style.

When in the gen. sing. and nom. pl. of a polysyllabic word is made slender, it also becomes voiced, thus:
* &gt; &gt; . The resulting is written - and is pronounced , , or , depending on dialect.
Some nouns undergo a vowel change before the slender consonant of the genitive singular/nominative plural:
* - an (internal) organ, component part
* - a sole, coin
* - a head
* - a man
* - a fish
* - a son (note: the &quot;first&quot; consonant is made slender in the gen.sg./nom.pl. as well)
* - a hole

Many words of this declension form the plural with one of the endings &quot;-(a)í, -ta, -tha, -anna&quot;. These are known as &quot;strong plural&quot; endings, which means the plural is identical in all cases in the standard language. Some examples:
*, gen. sg. , pl. - a fair
*, gen. sg. , pl. - a way
* , gen. sg. , pl. - a car
*, gen. sg. , pl. - a voice
*, gen. sg. , pl. - a child
*, gen. sg. , pl. - a cloud
*, gen. sg. , pl. - a rose
*, gen. sg. , pl. - a summer
*, gen. sg. , pl. - a story
*, gen. sg. , pl. - fruit

Some nouns have a weak plural (a plural where the genitive is different from the nominative, and is identical to the form of the nominative singular) in &quot;-a&quot;:
*, gen. sg. , nom. pl. , gen. pl. - a right
*, gen. sg. , nom. pl. , gen. pl. - a trick
*, gen. sg. , nom. pl. , gen. pl. - an apple

Other strong plural formations are found in:
* - road
* - judge
* - verb
* - skull
* - door
* - professor
* - light

====Second====
The second declension is made up of mostly feminine nouns, and features a nominative singular form that can end in either a broad or a slender consonant. The genitive singular ends in a slender consonant followed by &quot;-e&quot;. The most common plural form has a broad consonant followed by &quot;-a&quot; in the nominative, and a broad consonant alone in the genitive. The vocative has the same endings as the nominative, as does the dative in standard language.
In Connacht Irish and Waterford Irish it is often the case that all nouns of the second declension in the nom. sg. end with a slender consonant (e.g. &quot;a shoe&quot;).

In some Munster varieties as well as the old literary language, the dative singular is distinct and ends in a slender consonant alone (in effect the dative sg. is formed by dropping the &quot;-e&quot; from the genitive sg.), e.g. &quot;in my shoe&quot; (historically, nominative forms like are descended from the old dative).

When in the gen. sing. is made slender, it is also voiced, so &gt; &gt; . becomes , and is written -(a)í.
Many words in this declension form a strong plural with one of the endings &quot;-t(h)a,-te, -(e)acha&quot; or &quot;-eanna&quot;:
* &quot;place&quot;
* &quot;forest&quot;
* &quot;daughter&quot;
* &quot;work&quot;
* &quot;sky&quot;
* &quot;country&quot;
* &quot;wave&quot;
* &quot;egg&quot;

Other strong plural formations are found in:
* - tooth
* - shoulder
* - knife (irregular genitive singular)
* (m.) - mountain (irregular genitive singular and masculine gender)

====Third====
The third declension is made up of masculine and feminine nouns. It is characterized by the genitive singular in &quot;-a&quot;. The majority of nouns in this class form the plural in &quot;-(a)í&quot;. The final consonant of the stem may be broad or slender: it retains its quality in the plural, but is always broad in the genitive singular.

Feminine nouns in &quot;-áint&quot; or &quot;-úint&quot; lose their in the gen. sg.; those in &quot;-irt&quot; have -- instead of -- in the gen. sg.
* (f.) &quot;threat&quot;
* (f.) &quot;dialect&quot;

Many words in this declension form the plural with one of the endings &quot;-anna&quot; or &quot;-acha&quot;:
* (m.) &quot;time&quot;
* (m.) &quot;soul&quot;
* (m.) &quot;back&quot;
* (m.) &quot;lake&quot;
* (f.) &quot;fight, struggle&quot;

Some words in Munster Irish also have a separate dative form:
*&quot;nom.&quot; , &quot;dat.&quot; , &quot;gen.&quot; , &quot;pl.&quot; (m.) &quot;back&quot;

====Fourth====
The fourth declension is made up of masculine and feminine nouns. It is characterized by a genitive singular that is identical in form to the nominative/vocative/dative singular. The singular may end in a vowel or a consonant (usually the diminutive suffix &quot;-ín&quot;). The most common plural ending is &quot;-(a)í&quot;.

Many words of this declension form the plural with the following endings &quot;-tha/-t(h)e&quot;, &quot;-((e)a)nna&quot; or &quot;-((e)a)cha&quot;:
* (m.) &quot;animal&quot;
* (m.) &quot;attorney&quot;
* (m.) &quot;village&quot;
* (m.) &quot;bus&quot;
* (m.) &quot;son-in-law&quot;
* (f.) &quot;wound, sore&quot;
* (m.) &quot;nut&quot;
* (m.) &quot;outhouse; eye of a needle&quot;
* (m.) &quot;law&quot;
* (m.) &quot;dozen&quot;
* (m.) &quot;ray, radius&quot;
* (f.) &quot;goose&quot;
* (f.) &quot;shirt&quot;
* (m.) &quot;saying&quot;
* (m.) &quot;king&quot;
* (m.) &quot;last name&quot;
* (f.) &quot;language, tongue&quot;
* (f.) &quot;fire&quot;

Other strong plural formations are found in:
* (m.) &quot;name&quot;
* (m.) &quot;characteristic, symptom&quot;
* (f.) &quot;commandment&quot;
* (m.) &quot;bank (of river etc.)&quot;
* (m.) &quot;race, tribe&quot;
* (m.) &quot;person, human being&quot;
* (m.) &quot;blacksmith&quot;
* (m.) &quot;business&quot;
* (f.) &quot;night&quot;

One noun in this class has a weak plural:
* (f.) - cow

====Fifth====
The fifth declension is made up mostly of feminine nouns and is characterized by a genitive singular that ends in a broad consonant that has been added to the nominative/vocative/dative singular. The most common plural is strong, formed by adding &quot;-a&quot; to the genitive singular.

In some Munster Irish varieties as well as the old literary language, the dative singular is distinct and ends in a slender consonant (in effect the dative sg. is formed by palatalizing the genitive sg.), for example, &quot;to a person&quot;, &quot;from the city&quot;. The word (&quot;Ireland&quot;) retains the distinct dative form in the standard language.

Some words form the genitive singular by changing the final consonant of the nominative singular to broad. The plural is then strong &quot;-eacha&quot;.
* &quot;river&quot;
* (m.) &quot;father&quot;
* (m.) &quot;brother&quot;
* &quot;mother&quot;

Other strong plural formations are found in:
* (m.) &quot;brother (monk), friar&quot;
* (m.) &quot;friend&quot;
* (m.) &quot;enemy&quot;
* &quot;Christmas&quot;

Some nouns have weak plurals; here the genitive singular and genitive plural have the same form:
* - sheep
* - duck

====Verbal nouns====
The most productive verbal nouns end with &quot;-(e)adh&quot; (1st conjugation) or &quot;-(i)ú&quot; (2nd conjugation). These originally belonged to the third declension, but synchronically are best regarded as separate declensions.

The 1st conjugation verbal noun in &quot;-(e)adh&quot; has a genitive singular in &quot;-te/-ta&quot; and a plural in &quot;-t(a)í&quot;.
* &quot;breaking&quot;
* &quot;praising; recommendation&quot;

The 2nd conjugation verbal noun in has a genitive singular in and a plural in . These endings are pronounced the same regardless of the spelling distinction.
* &quot;examining, examination&quot;
* &quot;stretching&quot;

====Irregular nouns====
The following nouns are declined irregularly:
* (f.) &quot;woman&quot;
* (f.) &quot;sister&quot;
* (f.) &quot;drink&quot;
* (m.) &quot;God&quot;
* (m.) &quot;day&quot;
* (f.) &quot;bed&quot;
* (f.) &quot;month&quot;
* (f.) &quot;sea&quot;
* (f.) &quot;wool&quot;
* (m.) or (f.); &quot;land&quot;
* (m.) &quot;house&quot;

==Articles==
The definite article has two forms in Irish: and . Their distribution depends on number, case, and gender, and they trigger mutation partly on the basis of the initial sound of the following word. Each entry of the table gives an example of one noun starting with a consonant and one with a vowel.

Dative (i) is used with all prepositions in Ulster usage; in Munster and the standard language it is used only with &quot;from the&quot;, &quot;to the&quot;, and &quot;in the&quot; but there are also Munster dialects in which only triggers lenition and and eclipse, as with every other article-preposition compound. In Connacht eclipses whereas and lenite. Dative (ii) is used outside Ulster with other prepositions.

The article never mutates a following or in the singular, and is lenited to (pronounced ) rather than the usual . furthermore lenites in both dative (i) and (ii) in the singular with feminine nouns but does not lenite at all with masculine nouns.

It does, however, eclipse and in Munster dialects and forms like &quot; instead of the usual pattern &quot;, which is used in all other dialects, do occur.

There is no indefinite article in Irish, so depending on context can mean &quot;cat&quot; or &quot;a cat&quot;.

==Adjectives==
Almost all adjectives in Irish can be used either predicatively or attributively. A predicative adjective is one that forms a part of the predicate, like &quot;red&quot; in the sentence &quot;The car is red.&quot; An attributive adjective directly modifies a noun, as in &quot;the red car&quot;.

A predicate adjective in Irish does not inflect:

* &quot;That man is small.&quot;
* &quot;Those men are small.&quot;
* &quot;This woman is small.&quot;
* &quot;These women are small.&quot;

A predicate adjective expressing a value judgment is often preceded by the particle . This particle attaches to a following vowel.

* &quot;I&#x27;m fine&quot; (lit. &quot;I am good.&quot;)
* &quot;The story is bad.&quot;
* &quot;The weather was beautiful.&quot;

In Ulster, is not generally used in these cases.

An attributive adjective mostly follows the noun and is inflected:

* &quot;the small man&quot;
* &quot;of the small man&quot; (genitive)

There are four classes of declension of adjectives in Irish, which correspond to the first four declensions of nouns:
===First declension===

===Second declension===
===Third declension===

===Fourth declension===
This declension does not inflect, but it does mutate.
===Irregular adjectives===

;Notes
*The nominative plural undergoes lenition only if the noun ends with a slender consonant: &quot;lame cats&quot;. Otherwise, the adjective in the nominative plural does not lenite: &quot;lame tailors&quot;.
*The long form of the genitive plural (e.g. , , ) is used when the noun has a strong plural, e.g. &quot;of lame mothers&quot;. The short form (e.g. , , ) is used when the noun has a weak plural, e.g. &quot;of lame cats&quot;.
*The dative has the same form as the nominative.
*The vocative has the same form as the nominative except in the masculine singular of the 1st/2nd declension, where it has the same form as the genitive.

===Comparative===
Irish adjectives have a comparative form equivalent to the comparative and superlative in English. The comparative does not undergo inflexion and is the same as the feminine singular genitive in regular and many irregular adjectives.

====Regular formation====
====Irregular forms====
====Syntax of comparison====
There are two constructions to express the comparative:

1) Copula + comparative form + subject + (&quot;than&quot;) + predicate. The preterite of the copula causes lenition, while the present tense does not.

* &quot;Cáit was stronger than Cathal.&quot;
* &quot;Seán is bigger than me.&quot;
* &quot;The dog was younger than the cat.&quot;
* &quot;Broken Irish is better than clever English.&quot;

2) + comparative + + predicate. is used if the sentence is in the present or future tense.

, which triggers lenition, is used if the sentence is in the past tense. is used before words starting with vowels and before those starting with consonants.

* &quot;The sun is brighter than the moon.&quot;
* &quot;Peadar will be richer than his father.&quot;
* &quot;Peadar became richer than his father.&quot;
* &quot;Seán was bigger than me.&quot;

A superlative is expressed as a relative clause: noun + + comparative form.

* &quot;the strongest girl&quot; (lit. &quot;the girl who is the strongest&quot;)
* &quot;the strongest girl&quot; (lit. &quot;the girl who was/would be the strongest&quot;)
* &quot;the youngest boy&quot; (lit. &quot;the boy who is the youngest&quot;)
* &quot;the youngest boy&quot; (lit. &quot;the boy who was/would be the youngest&quot;)

<text>The Township of Woolwich (local pronunciation: IPA /ˈwʊl̴ɪt͡ʃ/) is a rural township in Southwestern Ontario. The municipality is located in the northeastern part of Waterloo Region and is made up of 10 small communities, with Elmira, Ontario the largest and St. Jacobs, Ontario the second largest. The population at the time of the 2021 Census was 26,999, up from the 2016 population of 25,006. Waterloo Region is still home to the largest population of Old Order Mennonites in Canada, particularly in the areas around St Jacobs and Elmira. They are often seen on the local roads using their traditional horse and buggy transportation; many also use horses to pull the implements in their farm fields.

Woolwich is part of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo and is located directly to the north and east of the City of Waterloo. It is bounded by the cities of Kitchener, Waterloo, and Cambridge. The township is a municipality as established by the Regional Municipality of Waterloo Act 1972, which created a regional government structure and established limits of the local municipalities effective January 1, 1973. Woolwich Township has its own municipal government consisting of five councillors and a mayor; the latter also serves on the Waterloo Region Council.

==History==
===Early history===
The land which now makes up Woolwich Township, with the Grand River on the east, and the Conestogo River on the west, originally belonged to the Huron Nation followed by the Mohawk Nation. The first settlers arrived in the late 18th century. In 1798, William Wallace was one of the first settlers after he was deeded 86,078 acres (348 km2) of land on the Grand River for a cost of $16,364. Originally Block three of Indian Lands, this area now comprises a large part of Woolwich Township. The parcel of land called &quot;Woolwich&quot; was probably named (in 1816) after a town in Kent, England. The early settlers were primarily from England or Ireland until about 1830; they settled to the east of the Grand River. Afterwards, German Mennonite families from Pennsylvania and from Waterloo Township settled west of the river.

In 1807, Wallace sold the major portion of his tract to Mennonites from Pennsylvania, trustees for the German Company, many of whom would settle this area. Wallace sold of land to the German Company at $1.00 an acre. Captain Smith, a loyalist from Vermont, settled at the confluence of the Grand and Conestogo Rivers in 1807. Their large log home served as an inn for travelers and he operated a stagecoach for carrying mail from 1835 to 1850. The first church in Woolwich, was built by the Mennonites from Pennsylvania in approximately 1823 at the Three Bridges, now part of Conestogo. Woolwich was incorporated as a Township in 1816, and was part of Halton County until 1842 when it became part of Wellington District. In 1852, it became part of the new Waterloo County.

Starting in 1821, a part of Woolwich, to the east of the Grand River (Block 3), owned by James Crooks, attracted dozens of families from England and Scotland. Previously, this area had few settlers, the most notable a Mr. Cox; the creek which enters the Grand River at what is now Winterbourne was named after him. Immigrants from Scotland began settling the Cox Creek area in 1834, led by John Davidson. He opened the first post office in the township, naming it East Woolwich. Captain Henry Lanphier arrived in 1854 and soon built a sawmill and flour mill after damming Cox Creek. Residents agreed with him that the settlement should be renamed Winterbourne, Ontario. By 1837, the Scots established St. Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian in 1837. A Presbyterian church was not built until 1870, made of logs; it was replaced in 1870 by one built of brick, and is currently a private home near the Winterbourne Presbyterian Cemetery. By 1867, Winterbourne had a population of 160, three churches, a school, a post office, a general store, two mills, two hotels, two blacksmiths, a tailor, a shoemaker and a physician.

St. Jacobs, like nearby Conestogo (both in Woolwich), was primarily Germanic and was first settled in 1830. In 1834, Edward Bristow from Sussex, England became one of Elmira&#x27;s first settlers when he purchased of land at this location for 50 cents per acre. He started the first store, tavern and potashery. A community by the name of Bristow&#x27;s Corners was already in existence in 1839 when a post office was assigned there; it was renamed Elmira in 1853.

Historical records suggest that David Musselman founded Conestogo after buying land in 1830. He built a sawmill in 1844 and after damming the Conestogo River, he added a flour mill and a second sawmill. The hamlet formed in this area, known as Musselman&#x27;s Mills until 1852 when it became Conestogo because many of the settlers had come from the Conestoga River area of Pennsylvania. Records about the entire township from 1846 indicate that the area was thinly settled although the land was excellent and there were large tracts of hardwood. There were two grist mills, two sawmills and an Episcopal church. The population count in 1841 indicated 1009 people.

Woolwich Township Council was organized in January 1850 with five councillors, of whom John N. Meyer was named as Reeve; James Dow was appointed as clerk and treasurer. A significant influx to the St. Jacobs area started afterwards, primarily consisting of additional Mennonites from Pennsylvania. Farmer and pioneer industrialist Jacob C. Snider, of Swiss German descent, was the most important settler at the time and the community was named after him: Jakobstettel (Jacob&#x27;s Village). He built a dam to power several mills and then built a sawmill, woolen mill and flour mill by 1852. This helped to attract others to the small community. The &quot;St.&quot; was added to the name simply to make it sound more pleasing and the pluralization was in honour of the combined efforts of Jacob C. Snider (1791–1865) and his son, Jacob C. Snider Jr. (1822–1857), founders of the village. The first post office in St. Jacobs opened in 1852, called St. Jacobs and the village was incorporated in that year. By 1855, the population was 400. Mennonites formed a significant proportion of the population in the 1850s. Most were the so-called Pennsylvania Dutch, not referring to the Netherlands but a misnomer for Deitsch or Deutsch (German). They became known as Old Order Mennonite due to their very conservative, traditional lifestyle. (Other Mennonites in the area now have a less conservative lifestyle.) 

===Decentralization and later urban growth===
Throughout its early history, Woolwich was predominantly decentralized and rural in character. It did not become the location of the Waterloo County administration apparatus, and the first wave of railway development in the county passed it by. In his study of Waterloo County&#x27;s growth and urbanization, urban studies scholar Fred Dahms uses &quot;functional units&quot; as a metric of a settlement&#x27;s developmental complexity, rather than relying on population counts, village or town status, or other metrics. Each &quot;functional unit&quot; is based on a defined economic hub or activity, such as banking or postal services, milling, or a general store. In this measure, one building (such as a combined general store and post office) would count as multiple functional units, providing an alternative way to measure the development of a pioneer economy. For 1864, while Woolwich had no large centre falling within the top five counts of functional units in the county, it did have three in the top ten: St. Jacobs, Elmira, and Conestogo. St. Jacobs, Conestogo, Winterbourne, and Elmira were all incorporated as villages by this point.

By the 1870s, things had changed dramatically; economic activity in Waterloo County was rapidly centralizing, and Elmira was now tied for fifth in the county in terms of functional units, alongside Ayr. In 1878, a significant majority of Woolwich village industries advertising themselves in the Armstrong and Company &quot;Gazetteer and Directory for Waterloo County&quot; were located in Elmira, with a number also located in St. Jacobs. This included carriage makers, lumber mills, metal crafters, a saddle and harness maker, a woollen mill, and others. In 1891, the Waterloo Junction Railway (part of the Grand Trunk Railway system) was extended north from Waterloo through Heidelberg and St. Jacobs, to Elmira. The Guelph and Goderich Railway (part of the Canadian Pacific Railway system) would later follow, running across the township from east to west.

In the early 1900s, Woolwich Township exhibited a strong German culture and those of German origin made up a third of the population in 1911. Because of increased immigration direct from Germany, Lutherans were the primary religious group by that time; there were nearly three times as many Lutherans as Mennonites.

Woolwich was the location of one of the earliest concrete roads in Canadian history. A stretch of what was then Provincial County Road 75, between St. Jacobs and the Grand Trunk Railway crossing south of Elmira, was upgraded in 1919 using a provincial subsidy under the newly-created Department of Public Highways of Ontario.

During the 1960s, due to the poor disposal practices of chemical manufacturers, contamination seeped down to the aquifer in and around Elmira. This contamination forced local water wells to close in 1990. Water is now delivered via a pipeline from Waterloo and other near local areas.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Woolwich had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In 2016, the average age in Woolwich was 39, with 49% of the population male and 51% female. In 2016, English was the predominant language spoken at 88% of households, followed by German 8%, and Dutch 0.58%, which make up the top three most spoken languages in Woolwich.

==Economy==
Elmira is the primary industrial centre of Woolwhich Township. Major employers include Trylon TSF, Sanyo Machine Works, Elmira Pet Products, Lanxess (formerly Chemtura and Uniroyal), Toyota Boshoku (formerly Trim Masters), Engineered Lifting Systems, and Southfield Windows &amp; Doors. Since the 1970s, tourism has become an increasingly important industry in Elmira and especially in St. Jacobs which has a very popular Farmers&#x27; Market and many quaint stores in its downtown area.

St. Jacobs features dozens of artisans in historic buildings, such as the Country Mill, Village Silos, Mill Shed, and the Old Factory. Visitors may watch artisans make pottery, quilts, designer clothes, jewellery, glass vases, woven wall hangings tiffany lamps, stained glass doors, miniature doll houses and more. There are also two blacksmith shops. The two-kilometre millrace is a pleasant, treed hiking path along the Conestogo River. The Visitor Centre in downtown St. Jacobs is a Mennonite interpretation centre, providing information and education about the Mennonite people in the township.

St. Jacobs is also the headquarters of Home Hardware, a national chain of over 1000 independent hardware retail stores located across Canada that was founded in the village in 1963. The first store opened in St. Jacobs in 1964. It remains in use by the chain as the furniture outlet but a new store was built across the street, opening in November 2014.

Economic development for the township is handled by the Region of Waterloo. Elmira and St. Jacobs have their own Business Improvement Area committees.

==Government==
The township is governed by an elected mayor and five elected councillors; two councillors representing Wards 1 and 3, and one for Ward 2. Council meetings are held in the Council Chambers at 24 Church Street West, Elmira. The mayor serves also as the regional councillor and sits on the various boards, including Waterloo North Hydro, Grand River Conservation Authority, Regional Library Board, Kiwanis Transit Board, Waterloo Region Community Housing Committee, Kissing Bridge Trailway Advisory Committee and Airport Master Plan Committee. After the election in 2018 the elected council members are:

Mayor: Sandy Shantz

Councillors:

* Ward 1: Evan Burgess
* Ward 1: Nathan Cadeau
* Ward 2: Eric Schwindt
* Ward 3: Bonnie Bryant
* Ward 3: Kayla Grant

Woolwich is one of seven municipalities that make up the Waterloo Regional Council. Members of the Regional Council serve a four-year term and Woolwich&#x27;s representative is the mayor alone. The Waterloo Regional Council is made up of the chair and eight councillors, as well as the mayors of the seven municipalities: Cambridge, Kitchener, Waterloo, and the townships of North Dumfries, Wellesley, Wilmot and Woolwich.

==Communities==
Woolwich consists of an extensive rural area along with residential communities and industrial/commercial areas. The residential communities include Elmira, St. Jacobs, Breslau, Conestogo, Heidelberg, Maryhill, North Woolwich, Bloomingdale, Weissenburg, West Montrose, Floradale, Winterbourne, and Zuber Corners.

The three largest areas offering a range of residential, industrial, commercial and recreational uses are in Elmira, St. Jacobs and Breslau; the latter adjoins Kitchener and is the fastest growing community in the township.

Woolwich Township spans approximately 326.15 km².

== Infrastructure ==

=== Health and medicine ===
Woolwich does not have its own hospitals, but residents of Woolwich have access to four nearby hospitals: Grand River Hospital, St. Mary&#x27;s General Hospital, Groves Memorial Community Hospital in Fergus and Guelph General Hospital.

===Transportation===

Woolwich is home to the Region of Waterloo International Airport (YKF), which is south of Breslau to the east of the Grand River.

There are two railway lines through Woolwich: the Guelph Subdivision (running approximately east–west) and the Waterloo Spur, a branch line of the Guelph Subdivision which runs north through Waterloo and St. Jacobs before terminating at Elmira. The junction of the two lines is in Kitchener, east of the Kitchener railway station. The Canadian National Railway (CN) operates freight rail services on both lines. The Waterloo Central Railway, a tourist and heritage railway, operates along the Waterloo Spur between Elmira and a stop near Northfield station in north Waterloo. It provides the only stopping passenger service in Woolwich. GO Transit and Via Rail operate regional and intercity services respectively, both along the Guelph Subdivision, but do not stop in the township. A GO station in Breslau is planned, which would provide GO Transit passenger service on the Kitchener line.

Grand River Transit&#x27;s 21 Elmira route provides local bus service between Woolwich and Waterloo, running between Conestoga station (in Waterloo) and Elmira. The route launched in 2009. PC Connect, an inter-regional community bus service based in Perth County, launched in 2020 with a route connecting Kitchener, Waterloo, St. Jacobs, Elmira, and Listowel together.

Highways
* Highway 7: Southern Portion of Woolwich (Breslau Area)
* Highway 85: Entering Woolwich from the City of Waterloo
* Highway 8: Approximately 20 km (12 miles) to Elmira and 12 km (7.5 miles) to the Woolwich boundary
* Highway 401: Approximately 28 km (17 miles) to Elmira and 20 km (12 miles) to the woolwich boundary

===Trails===

Woolwich Township has eleven trails; much of the long Kissing Bridge Trailway runs through this area.

===Woolwich Memorial Centre===
The Woolwich Memorial Centre (WMC) is the Township of Woolwich&#x27;s newest state-of-the-art facility comprising two NHL-sized ice surfaces, two pools, fitness centre and walking track. The facility also includes a community centre, seniors centre, youth centre, Concourse Cafe, two meeting rooms and offices for minor sport teams.

== Education ==
Schools in Woolwich are operated by the Waterloo Region District School Board and Waterloo Catholic District School Board. Woolwich has eight elementary schools; seven are public and one is Catholic. Elmira District Secondary School is Woolwich&#x27;s only secondary (high) school, but is ranked by Fraser Institute as a top Ontario high school.

<doc id="485322" wikidata="Q2746" url="?curid=485322" title="Ryazan">
<text>Ryazan (, ; also Riazan) is the largest city and administrative center of Ryazan Oblast, Russia. The city is located on the banks of the Oka River in Central Russia, southeast of Moscow. As of the 2010 Census, Ryazan had a population of 524,927, making it the 33rd most populated city in Russia, and the fourth most populated in Central Russia after Moscow, Voronezh, and Yaroslavl.An older city, now known as Old Ryazan (), was located east of modern-day Ryazan during the late Middle Ages, and served as capital of the Principality of Ryazan up until the Mongol invasion in 1237. During the Siege of Ryazan, it became one of the first cities in Russia to be besieged and completely razed to the ground. The capital was subsequently moved to Pereyaslavl-Ryazansky (), and later renamed to Ryazan by order of Catherine the Great in 1778.

The city is known for the Ryazan Kremlin, a historic museum; the Pozhalostin Museum, one of the oldest art museums in Russia; the Memorial Museum-Estate of Academician I.P. Pavlov; and the Ryazan Museum of Long-Range Aviation.

In 2022, the Ministry of Construction published an updated rating of the new urban digitalization index. Ryazan entered the top three cities with a population of 250 thousand to a million people.

==History==
=== Principality of Ryazan ===

The first written mention of the city, under the name of Pereslavl, dates to 1095. The city became part of the independent Principality of Ryazan, which had existed since 1129, centered on the old city of Ryazan. The first ruler of Ryazan was supposedly Yaroslav Sviatoslavich, Prince of Ryazan and Murom (cities of Kievan Rus&#x27;).

==== Invasion by Mongols ====

In the 12th century, the lands of Ryazan – being located on the border between woodlands and the steppe – suffered numerous invasions from the southern and northern parts of European Russia. Southern invasions were usually carried out by the Cumans; on the northern side Ryazan was in conflict with Vladimir-Suzdal, who by the end of the 12th century had burnt the capital of Ryazan several times.

In the 13th century, Ryazan was the first Russian city to face Mongolian invasion by the hordes of Batu Khan. On December 21, 1237, after a short siege, it was completely destroyed and never recovered. As a result of the takeover, the seat of the principality was moved about to the town of Pereslavl-Ryazansky, which subsequently took the name of the destroyed capital. The site of the old capital now carries the name of Staraya Ryazan (&quot;Old Ryazan&quot;), close to Spassk-Ryazansky. Maps of the 16th-18th centuries show Ryazan (Old Ryazan) and Pereslavl-Ryazan together.

==== Golden Horde ====

In 1380, during the Battle of Kulikovo, the Grand Prince of Ryazan Oleg and his men came under a coalition of Mamai, a strongman of the Tatar Golden Horde, and the Grand Duke of Lithuania, against the armies under the command of the Grand Prince of Vladimir, Dmitry Donskoy.

Late in the 13th century, the Princes of Ryazan moved their capital to Pereyaslavl&#x27; (), which is known as Ryazan from the 16th century (officially renamed in 1778).

The principality was finally dissolved and incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Moscow in 1521. The principality&#x27;s last duke, Ivan V of Ryazan, was imprisoned for a short time for being suspected in a treasonous attempt to seal a treaty with Crimean Khanate in order to outweigh Moscow&#x27;s influence. The duke fled to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania where he died no later than 1534. 

Being the southernmost border of Rus&#x27; lands at the time, Ryazan continued to suffer from invasions of Crimean Tatars and their allies.

=== Grand Duchy of Moscow ===

=== Tsardom of Russia ===
==== Time of Troubles ====

In June of 1605 Ryazan became a seat for Greek Cypriot-born Patriarch Ignatius, a clergyman who was sent by Russian Orthodox Church to serve as an archbishop of Ryazan. He was notorious for becoming the first church official to recognize a Poland-backed impostor False-Dmitry as a legitimate monarch, alleged Czar of Tsardom of Russia, after meeting with his forces in Tula.

Around that time Ryazan ex-duchy became a home for various noble families, most notable of which are Lyapunovs, whose brothers Prokopy and Zakhary Lyapunovs played a significant roles in shaping Russian history during Times of Troubles.

===Soviet Union===
During World War II, Ryazan was repeatedly bombed by German Luftwaffe. Immediately after the war, rapid development of the city began, and it became a major industrial, scientific, and military center of the European part of Russia. On October 19, 1960 a petroleum refinery produced its first gasoline.

Ryazan housed the USSR&#x27;s only producer of potato-harvesting equipment at the time. Ryazselmash factory (), an accounting machines plant, and a heavy forging equipment plant, among others, were also built.

Because of the city&#x27;s industrialization, Ryazan Oblast&#x27;s share of workers employed in the agrarian sector shifted into the industrial sector.

Ryazan was developed as a military center, and became the main training center of the Soviet Airborne Forces. Several positioned man-portable air-defense systems protect the urban sky. Besides the Airborne School (at the time named after Kliment Voroshilov), Ryazan has the Automobile School and Institute of Communications, a regiment of railway troops, airbase strategic bombers, and a training center in Diaghilev.

Ryazan developed particularly rapidly while Nadezhda Nikolaevna Chumakova served as Chair of the Council of People&#x27;s Deputies of Ryazan and Ryazan mayor. Under Chumakova, the city&#x27;s population increased from 72,000 to 520,000. Chumakova oversaw the construction of social and cultural amenities, more than 20 urban areas, and hundreds of kilometers of trolleybus, tram and bus routes. Landscaping became a fundamental strategy for the development of the city at that time. A &quot;green&quot; ring of forests, parks, and garden associations surrounded Ryazan, with large parks located in each area of the city, and compositions of flowers and vertical gardening became customary, not only for the main streets, but also for industrial zones and factory buildings. Ryazan repeatedly won recognition among the cities of the Soviet Union for its landscaping. During her 26 years in office, Chumakova often accepted awards of the Red Banner of the USSR on behalf of Ryazan.

===Post-Soviet period===

By the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, more than half of the city&#x27;s GDP was being exported into its satellite states. In the 1990s, Ryazan experienced significant economic troubles as part of the 1998 Russian financial crisis, with many ex-Soviet and newly established companies going bankrupt by the end of the decade. In September 1999, Ryazan suffered a series of attempted apartment bombings (see Ryazan Incident below). 

As of 2001, Ryazan remained significantly politically and economically influenced by the neighboring Moscow Oblast.

=== Architecture ===
Ryazan&#x27;s buildings are not characterized by any single architectural style. Many noted Russian architects worked in Ryazan, including Kazakov, who worked and died in this city, and built the house of Politech University. 

Ryazan&#x27;s churches were built between the 15th and 19th centuries. Soviet Constructivism was an important step in Ryazan architecture.
===Community===
In 2006 and 2007, the Public Committee in Defense of the Historical and Architectural Museum &quot;Ryazan Kremlin&quot; campaigned against attempts by the Diocese of Voronezh to establish ownership over the Ryazan Kremlin.

A number of environmental groups are active in the city, campaigning for the removal of illegal landfills and volunteering for water area clean up. In 2019 and 2020, these groups organized and staged ecological pickets and protests.

Ryazan Cycling has built bike paths in the central parks of the city. This activity attracted the attention of the government, who promise to build several similar paths passing through the whole territory of Ryazan.

===Religion===
Ryazan is the seat of Diocese of Ryazan and Kasimov, an eparchy of the Russian Orthodox Church. Assumption Cathedral of the Ryazan Kremlin is one of the most important cathedrals in the city.

In addition, the city is home to a number of religious people, including Catholics, Lutherans, Baptists, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Pentecostals, Seventh-day Adventists, Mormons, Charismatics and Muhtasibat Muslims, who built the Islamic Cultural Center.
===Tourism===
Ryazan is one of the leading tourist destinations in Central Russia. The Ryazan Kremlin is a symbol and the main landmark in Ryazan. It is an ensemble of the old main of Ryazan fortress (11 cen.), churches (15 - 20 cen.) and the Palace of Oleg. Sobornaia Bell is one of the highest bells of the Orthodox Church.

==Crime==

=== 1990s gangs ===
Ryazan, like many cities in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union, saw a rise in crime during the 1990s. () (Slony for short), one of the largest gangs in Russia, managed to monopolize the downtown area and the criminal underworld of Ryazan. The name is literally translated as &quot;Elephants&quot;, after one of its leaders&#x27; height and power: Vyacheslav Ermolov Evgenievich (born 1962) nicknamed &quot;Elephant&quot;. Before his criminal career started he was a taxi driver. The other leader was a personal driver of the vice prosecutor of the city.

In 1991, the gang became heavily involved in the racketeering of newly-privatized industries, motor vehicle sales, real estate, contract killings in other regions, participated in gang violence, kidnappings, and committed at least one armed attack on rivals which left eight or ten dead in November of 1993. 

According to Russian TV channel NTV, the gang was linked to local authorities. By 1995, Slony managed to briefly seize control over almost the entire business community of Ryazan. This situation continued up until 1996 when local law enforcement managed to apprehend some suspects linked to the gang. By 2000 the gang was almost completely eliminated. Some members were either sentenced to jail or were on the run. One member of the group allegedly committed suicide in a detention center of Tolyatti in 2016 and another in Ryazan according to Russian sources. Slony&#x27;s chief leader, Ermolov, was still wanted as of August 2021.

In the same period, evidence was gathered against the former (4th) mayor and chairman of city duma, . Provotorova held powerful positions in the city for eight years, and, according to local authorities, was associated with the activities of the Slony gang.

=== Ryazan Incident ===
In 1999 a group of allegedly plain-clothes FSB officers attempted to blow up a building on the East side of the city. The event is known as the Ryazan Incident.

===2000s===
Today, the crime rate in Ryazan is one of the lowest among the cities of the Central Federal District according to the Russian Interior Ministry. In the first six-months of 2012, 579.6 crimes were reported per hundred-thousand people, almost half the Central Federal District average of 839 reported crimes per hundred-thousand people. The low crime rate in Ryazan is often attributed to increased number of police patrols, high number of military schools, and voluntary militias headquarters distributed throughout the city&#x27;s districts.

==Economy==


Major industry enterprises in the city include a military radio electronics production plant and an oil refinery (subsidiary) of Rosneft, JSC Ryazan Oil Refining Company). The plant can refine 17 million metric tons of oil per year and is the city&#x27;s largest employer. 

Around a quarter of the city&#x27;s population works in the electronics industry. The most notable company in this sector is Plazma, which produces plasma screens for products including tanks and locomotives. In 1994, the company created a 50-50 research and development joint-venture with the South Korean company Orion PDP. In addition to plasma technology, Plazma produces LCD screens, industrial gas lasers and medical lasers. The company exports its products to the United States, China, and Israel, among others.

In 1993 software development company EPAM Systems entered the Ryazan market. As of 2016 it worked in joint venture with RSREU helping to teach students for free. 

In 2012 Russian search giant Yandex launched the 40MW data center in Sasovo; it is expected to accommodate 100,000 servers by 2019.

A steel casting company in the northwestern section of the city produces heavy steelworks and product, including industrial steel pipes for use in nuclear power plants. The plant employs a centrifugal casting method.

<text>Wladimir Petrovich Köppen ( ; ; , ; 25 September 1846 – 22 June 1940) was a Russian–German geographer, meteorologist, climatologist and botanist. After studies in St. Petersburg, he spent the bulk of his life and professional career in Germany and Austria. The Köppen climate classification system, named after a proposal he first made in 1884, with some modifications, is still widely used. Köppen made significant contributions to several branches of science, and coined the name aerology for the science of the upper atmosphere.

== Background and education ==

Wladimir Köppen was born in St. Petersburg, Russia. He lived there until he was 20 years old. He died in Graz, Austria. Köppen&#x27;s grandfather was one of several German doctors invited to Russia by Empress Catherine II to improve sanitation and was later personal physician to the tsar. His son, Wladimir&#x27;s father, Peter von Köppen (Pyotr Ivanovich Köppen in Russian) (1793–1864), was a noted geographer, historian and ethnographer of ancient Russian cultures and an important contributor to intellectual exchanges between western European slavists and Russian scientists. He attended secondary school in Simferopol, Crimea, and began his studies of botany in 1864 at the University of St. Petersburg.

He frequently traveled to his family&#x27;s estate on the Crimean coast from St. Petersburg and to and from Simferopol, in the interior of the peninsula. The floral and geographical diversity of the Crimean peninsula, as well as the starker geographical transitions between the capital and his home, did much to awaken an interest in the relationship between climate and the natural world. In 1867, he transferred to the University of Heidelberg and in 1870 he defended his doctorate dissertation on the effects of temperature on plant growth at the University of Leipzig. He served in the Prussian ambulance corps in the Franco-Prussian War and later worked at the Central Physical Observatory in St. Petersburg.

He identified five major climatic groups, which correspond with the five main vegetation groups:
* Tropical rainy climate
* Dry climate
* Warm temperature rainy climate
* Snowy and cold climate
* Polar climate

== Career and contributions ==
Köppen was a principal founder of modern climatology and meteorology. Between 1850 and 1860, Köppen contributed to Seewart&#x27;s sailing handbooks for the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans by studying ship reports over the winds of different oceans. Between 1872 and 1873 Köppen was employed in the Russian meteorological service as an assistant where he helped prepare the daily synoptic weather map. In 1875, he moved back to Germany and became the chief of the new Division of Marine Meteorology at the German naval observatory (Deutsche Seewarte) based in Hamburg. There, he was responsible for establishing a weather forecasting service for the northwestern part of Germany and the adjacent sea areas. After four years of service, he was able to move on to his primary interest of fundamental research, and left the meteorological office.

Köppen began a systematic study of the climate and also experimented with balloons to obtain data from upper layers of the atmosphere. In 1884, he published the first version of his map of climatic zones in which the seasonal temperature ranges were plotted. It led to the development of the Köppen climate classification system around 1900, which he kept improving for the rest of his life. The full version of his system appeared first in 1918; after several modifications, the final version was published in 1936.

Apart from the description of various climate types, he was acquainted with paleoclimatology as well. In 1924, he and his son-in-law Alfred Wegener published a paper called &quot;Die Klimate der Geologischen Vorzeit&quot; (The climates of the geological past) providing crucial support to the Milanković theory on ice ages. Also, in 1911 he co-wrote &quot;The Thermodynamics of the Atmosphere&quot;, a textbook that became very popular.

Towards the end of his life, Köppen cooperated with the German climatologist Rudolf Geiger to produce a five-volume work, &quot;Handbuch der Klimatologie&quot; (Handbook of Climatology). It was never completed, but several parts, three of them by Köppen, were published. After Köppen&#x27;s death in 1940, Geiger continued to work on modifications to the climate classification system.

Köppen was a prolific scientist, producing more than 500 papers, and he retained his intellectual curiosity and wide range of interests throughout his life. In 1890, he co-authored the first cloud atlas. Alongside scientific pursuits, he was actively involved in social questions, devoting much time and energy to such problems of land-use and school reform and nutrition for the underprivileged. He was a strong advocate for the use of Esperanto in the cause of world peace, translating several of his publications into Esperanto.

He had a wife, Marie, and five children including his daughter Else, who married Köppen&#x27;s student Alfred Wegener. Marie&#x27;s sister Sophie and her children moved in with the Köppens in 1888.

<doc id="485333" wikidata="Q336459" url="?curid=485333" title="Geoffrey Lawrence, 1st Baron Oaksey">
<text>Geoffrey Lawrence, 3rd Baron Trevethin, 1st Baron Oaksey, (2 December 1880 – 28 August 1971) was the lead British judge during the Nuremberg trials after Second World War, and President of the International Military Tribunal.

==Biography==
The Lawrence family came from Builth Wells in Radnorshire, Wales. Lawrence was born in London, England on 2 December 1880. Geoffrey Lawrence was the youngest son of Lord Trevethin, briefly Lord Chief Justice of England in 1921–22. He attended Haileybury (where Clement Attlee was his junior) and New College, Oxford.

Lawrence was called to the Bar by the Inner Temple in 1906, and later joined the chambers of Sir Robert Finlay. The chambers specialised in taking appellate cases to the highest courts—the House of Lords for domestic cases, and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for appeals from the Dominions and Colonies. Finlay came to rely on Lawrence, although for cases from Canada, Lawrence acted as lead counsel with Finlay as junior.

On 26 September 1914, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery Territorial Force (2nd East Anglian Brigade). He was promoted to temporary lieutenant on 20 November 1914. He served in France with the Royal Artillery, was mentioned in dispatches twice and as a major, was appointed to the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in 1918. After the war he continued in membership of the Territorial Army until 1937.

On returning to the Bar Lawrence continued to take cases to the Privy Council. An interest in horses, inherited from his father, led to his appointment as Attorney for the Jockey Club from 1922. Soon after he was appointed as Recorder of Oxford, a part-time judgeship.

In 1927 Lawrence was made a King&#x27;s Counsel and appointed Attorney General to the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII). With this appointment came membership of the Council of the Duchy of Cornwall. Lawrence served in this capacity until, in 1932, he was appointed as a judge of the King&#x27;s Bench Division, receiving the customary knighthood.

Two weeks after the Kristallnacht in 1938, Lawrence helped Cornelia Oberlander flee Nazi Germany.

As a judge, Lawrence tended to keep out of the limelight by neither issuing sensational judgments nor drawing attention to himself. When Lord Goddard was chosen as a Law Lord, Lawrence succeeded him as a Lord Justice of Appeal in 1944.

=== Nuremberg trials ===

He was chosen as an experienced judge to be the lead to Norman Birkett in the British delegation to the Judicial group in the Nuremberg trials, though not (as some thought) arising out of his friendship with Attlee who was by then Prime Minister. He was then elected as President of all the Judges, more through the lack of enemies than any other factor. His conduct of the trials was praised by many of those involved who appreciated his striving to understand the relevance of each piece of evidence, and willingness to stop long-winded counsel.

Lawrence was not considered an exceptional legal talent but won acclaim for delivering a very clear judgment (largely penned by Birkett) that expressed the moral sense of the Court&#x27;s conclusions. After the trials, Lawrence was raised to the peerage as Baron Oaksey, of Oaksey in the County of Wilts., on 13 January 1947 (he also inherited the Barony of Trevethin from his brother on 25 June 1959 but was always known as Lord Oaksey).

As a senior legal figure in the House of Lords, he served as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary from 1947 and on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council until he retired in 1957.

==Personal life==
Lawrence married Marjorie Frances Alice (1898–1984) on 22 December 1921. She served in the ATS in the Second World War, gaining the OBE, and became a magistrate after the war. They had a country estate at Oaksey in Wiltshire, where Lawrence bred championship Guernsey cattle. They had three daughters and a son. Their son John was a well known amateur jockey and horse racing journalist; he too only used the title Lord Oaksey.

== Retirement and death ==
In retirement, Lord Oaksey, as he now was, dedicated himself to his farm, judging several county agricultural shows.

Lord Oaksey died on 28 August 1971 in Oaksey, Wiltshire, England.

Birkett received his education at Barrow-in-Furness Higher Grade School. He was a Methodist preacher and a draper before attending Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1907, to study theology, history and law. Upon graduating in 1910 he worked as a secretary and was called to the Bar in 1913.

Declared medically unfit for military service during World War I, Birkett used the time to make up for his late entry into the legal profession and was appointed a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1924. He became a criminal defence lawyer and acted as counsel in a number of famous cases including the second of the Brighton trunk murders. A member of the Liberal Party, he sat in Parliament for Nottingham East twice, first in 1923 and again in 1929.

Despite refusing appointment to the High Court of Justice in 1928, he was offered the position again in 1941 and accepted, joining the King&#x27;s Bench Division. In 1945 he served as the alternate British judge at the Nuremberg trials, and he was made a privy counsellor in 1947. He joined the Court of Appeal in 1950 but retired in 1956 when he had served for long enough to draw a pension. From 1958 he served in the House of Lords, and his speech against a private bill in 1962 (the Bill sought to convert the Cumbrian lake Ullswater into a reservoir) saw it defeated by 70 votes to 36, two days before he died on 10 February 1962.

Described as &quot;one of the most prominent Liberal barristers in the first half of the 20th century&quot; and &quot;the Lord Chancellor that never was&quot;, Birkett was noted for his skill as a speaker, which helped him defend clients with almost watertight cases against them. As an alternate judge, Birkett was not allowed a vote at the Nuremberg Trials, but his opinion helped shape the final judgment. During his tenure in the Court of Appeal he oversaw some of the most significant cases of the era, particularly in contract law, despite his avowed dislike of judicial work.

==Early life and education==
Norman was born in Ulverston, Lancashire (now part of the administrative county of Cumbria), on 6 September 1883 to Thomas Birkett, a draper, and his wife Agnes, who died in 1884 of tuberculosis. He attended the Wesleyan primary school in Ulverston until 1894, when he moved to Barrow-in-Furness Higher Grade School. Although intelligent, Birkett was not noted as a particularly academic student and spent as much time on practical jokes as he did on his studies. He left school in 1898, starting work as an apprentice in one of the draper&#x27;s shops owned by his father and beginning to preach. He was a popular local preacher on the local Methodist circuit, and, on deciding that he was unlikely to be a good draper, his father allowed him to leave the business in 1904 to become a minister under Charles Bedale. In 1905, Bedale suggested Birkett should go to Cambridge University to study history and theology. Birkett liked the idea, having previously conversed with A. C. Benson, the Master of Magdalene College, and applied to Emmanuel College, Cambridge. The college offered him a place, with the condition that he would have to pass an entrance examination and complete the responsions to be accepted into the university as a whole. He spent three months learning Latin and Greek and was accepted into the university in October 1907.

At Cambridge, Birkett preached on the local Methodist circuit and at The Leys School. He was also active in sport, playing rugby, football and golf. He first spoke at the Cambridge Union Society in his second term at Cambridge on the motion of &quot;this House would welcome the Disestablishment of the Church of England&quot;, and the &quot;Cambridge Review&quot; reported that it was &quot;a most interesting speech&quot;. In his second year, he was elected to the Emmanuel Debating Society Committee and spoke many times at the Union on subjects including Home Rule for Ireland, cruelty to animals and secular education. He befriended Arnold McNair, the Secretary of the Union, and McNair agreed to put Birkett&#x27;s name on the electoral papers for election to the Union Committee. Birkett failed to get in, but on running again in 1910 was elected Secretary of the Union by a margin of only six votes. He became vice-president the following term, and President the term after that. While Birkett was president, the &quot;Cambridge Review&quot; reported that there was &quot;no speaker more sure of pleasing the house&quot;, and the speech he gave when Theodore Roosevelt visited Cambridge was well received by both Roosevelt and the university as a whole.

He gained a Second Class in the Part I History Tripos in 1909, and won the English Essay Prize with an essay on political satire in English poetry. He won the same prize again in 1910, and that year gained first-class honours in his Theological Special Examination. By this point, he was having doubts about his future as a minister and consulted with the university Law Reader as to the possibility of a career as a barrister. On the Reader&#x27;s advice, Birkett took the Part 2 Law Tripos in 1911, passing with second-class honours. Birkett interviewed with the editors of &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot; in his search for a job to sustain him while he took the bar exam. He took a job as personal secretary to George Cadbury Junior, with a wage of £200 a year, which he planned to hold until he qualified as a barrister. After only a month of working for Cadbury, his salary was raised to £500, and he was offered a permanent position. While there, he continued his political work and spoke on behalf of the Liberal Party, cementing his reputation as an effective speaker by, on one occasion, holding the attention of more than a thousand people for an hour. He took the first part of the Bar Examination in 1912, but failed the paper on real property; he passed it on his second attempt, and was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple on 4 June 1913.

While working for Cadbury, Birkett befriended Ruth &quot;Billy&quot; Nilsson, and after he had proposed to her several times, she agreed to marry him. Nilsson gave up her position at Bourneville to move to London and they were married on 25 August 1920. They had two children, a daughter Linnea Birkett on 27 June 1923, and a son Michael Birkett on 22 October 1929. A keen golfer, he was a member of the Harewood Downs Golf Club, near Amersham, Buckinghamshire.

==Practice at the Bar and time as a member of parliament==
After qualifying as a barrister, he moved to Birmingham in 1914, choosing the city because he had some connections there thanks to his association with Cadbury, and began work at the chambers of John Hurst. His career was aided by the outbreak of World War I; many of the younger and fitter barristers were called up for war service, whilst Birkett himself, who was thirty when he joined the bar, avoided conscription as he was declared medically unfit. He was suffering from tuberculosis, and he returned to Ulverston for six months to recover. During his time in Birmingham, he continued his work as a minister, regularly preaching at the Baptist People&#x27;s Chapel.

Birkett became a popular defence counsel, something that on occasion caused him trouble; he was once forced to refuse a defendant&#x27;s request to act as his representative because Birkett was expected in a different court. He impressed the Bench in Birmingham so much that, in 1919, he was advised by a local Circuit Judge to move to London to advance his career. Although he was initially hesitant, saying that &quot;competition in London is on quite a different scale, and if I failed there, I would have lost everything I have built up here&quot;, a case he took in 1920 changed the situation. He acted as a junior for the prosecution in the so-called Green Bicycle Case against Edward Marshall Hall. Although he lost, he sufficiently impressed Marshall Hall for the latter to offer him a place in his chambers in London. He had no connections with the solicitors in London, and the clerk at his new chambers got around this lack of contacts by using him as counsel in cases involving Marshall Hall, who as a King&#x27;s Counsel could appear in court only when accompanied by a junior barrister such as Birkett.

===Member of Parliament===
His father had been a supporter of the Liberal Party, and Birkett had helped campaign for them during the 1906 general election. He had been invited to become the Liberal candidate for Cambridge in 1911, but he refused because he had no income; he did, however, help his employer George Cadbury, Jr. get elected as a Liberal Councillor in Birmingham and helped start a branch of the National League of Young Liberals in the city.
Birkett was the Liberal candidate for Birmingham King&#x27;s Norton in the 1918 general election, but lost to Herbert Austin. Birkett&#x27;s political career took off in 1923. He ran for Nottingham East in the 1923 general election, and was elected with a majority of 1,436 votes, a feat that was described as an &quot;overwhelming victory&quot; since the Conservative Party had held the seat since 1910 and had a majority of 4,000 at the previous election.

Birkett&#x27;s maiden speech in Parliament responded to a proposal by Charles Dukes, a Labour Party Member of Parliament, in favour of state pensions for widows with children, and wives whose husbands were unable to work because of injury. Birkett went further than the proposed change and suggested that pensions should be provided to unmarried mothers, deserted wives and divorced wives. His speech was well-received; the &quot;Nottingham Journal&quot; described it as making &quot;a most excellent impression&quot; on the House of Commons, and Charles Masterman called him &quot;a possible future Lord Chancellor&quot;. Because of his focus on his career as a barrister rather than as a politician, Birkett rarely appeared in the House of Commons, but he worked hard when he did attend. On one occasion, he spent all night in a Parliamentary session that ended at 6 a.m. and then attended a court session the next day.

He applied to become a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1924, since barristers who were also parliamentarians stood a higher chance of getting accepted than others. He was accepted on 15 April 1924 and sworn in on the same day. His promotion was met with approval from several noted judges, including Arthur Greer, later a Lord Justice of Appeal, who wrote that &quot;unless my judgement is very much astray, you will quickly acquire a leading place in the front row&quot;, a feeling which was echoed by other justices including William Finlay, who wrote that &quot;I am confident that you will rise to the top of the profession, and I shall very greatly rejoice when my confidence is justified.&quot; In his first year as a King&#x27;s Counsel Birkett earned £8,600, double what he had taken the previous year as a junior brief.

In 1924, the Campbell Case brought down the Labour minority government and forced a general election. Birkett returned to Nottingham East to campaign for his re-election, though he faced a much more difficult job than he had in 1923. The Conservative candidate, Edmund Brocklebank, was much stronger than in the previous election, and the left-wing vote was split because he was also campaigning against Tom Mann, a noted Communist. A few days before the election, the Zinoviev letter, allegedly addressed to the Communist Party, was published that mentioned organising uprisings in British colonies; fear of the &quot;socialist menace&quot; drove many voters to the right, and in the election on 29 October 1924, many Liberal members of parliament, including Birkett, lost their seats to Conservatives.

===Practice at the Bar in London===
While working with Marshall Hall, Birkett was involved in several notable criminal cases that helped cement his reputation as an outstanding speaker at the Bar.

In 1925, a case known as the &quot;Bachelor&#x27;s Case&quot; came up at the High Court of Justice between Lieutenant-Colonel Ian Dennistoun and his ex-wife Dorothy Dennistoun. When the Dennistouns divorced, Mr. Dennistoun could not pay ancillary relief. He instead promised that he would provide for his ex-wife in the future when he had the money. Some time after the divorce, Mr. Dennistoun married Almina Herbert, Countess of Carnarvon, the widow of Lord Carnarvon, a rich woman thanks to the terms of her husband&#x27;s will, who provided for her new husband. After hearing about this, Dorothy Dennistoun demanded the alimony money she had been promised. Lady Carnarvon saw this as blackmail and persuaded her new husband to take his wife to court for what Sir Henry McCardie, who tried the case, called &quot;the most bitterly conducted litigation I have ever known&quot;. Marshall Hall and Birkett both worked on the case representing Lady Carnarvon and Mr. Dennistoun, while Ellis Hume-Williams, one of the most respected divorce barristers of the day, represented Mrs. Dennistoun.

The case initially appeared to be going badly for Marshall Hall. An inept cross-examination on his part weakened his argument, and an illness made him irritable and short-tempered. On the advice of his clerk, he asked Birkett to make the closing address before the court, which turned the mood of the courtroom completely and an initially hostile jury decided to disregard the agreement of Mr. Dennistoun to pay ancillary relief to his former wife. Birkett&#x27;s performance made the front pages of many evening newspapers, including &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; which described Birkett as &quot;the greatest legal discovery of the year&quot; and called his speech &quot;a brilliant piece of advocacy&quot;. His work for this case and the newspaper coverage of it brought him to the attention of many London solicitors, and led to him earning £8,000 in the first seven months of 1925. In that year he made £12,000 overall, an amount which rose to £16,500 in 1926 and peaked in 1929 when he earned £33,500. On meeting Miles Malleson, an old friend from his time at Cambridge, he said in surprise &quot;did you know, Miles, that I am making more money than I thought existed in the world!&quot;

===Return to politics===
Birkett was returned as MP for Nottingham East at the general election on 31 May 1929 in which he won 14,049 votes, taking the seat with a majority of 2,939.
As the largest single party, the Labour Party formed a minority government and set about filling the ministerial posts. The Labour Party had few experienced lawyers in the House of Commons, so Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald attempted to lure prominent Liberal lawyers to fill the positions of Attorney General and Solicitor General for England and Wales. William Jowitt defected to the Labour Party in exchange for the position of Attorney General, and the position of Solicitor General was offered to Birkett. Birkett replied that &quot;he could not change his politics in twenty-five minutes, and even if the Liberal Party should disintegrate completely, he would not be seen taking refuge in the Labour ark&quot;.

Despite having to juggle his career at the Bar and as a member of parliament, Birkett kept up a good attendance in the House of Commons, and along with Sir John Simon he became the leading Liberal spokesperson on the legal side of legislation. His attack on a clause of the Finance Act 1930 drew much praise from both Liberal and Conservative politicians, including Winston Churchill, who said that &quot;I have rarely heard a speech more precisely directed at the object under debate, more harmoniously attuned to the character of Committee discussion, than the excellent statement the Honourable and learned Gentleman has just made&quot;. Birkett led the Liberal response to the Labour proposal of the Trade Disputes Bill 1931 and &quot;reduced it to tatters&quot;, although the Bill passed because of some Liberal abstentions. The speech was a particularly well-received one and led MacDonald to again offer the position of Solicitor General to Birkett, as the incumbent postholder James Melville was about to resign. Again Birkett refused, and Stafford Cripps was appointed. When the Liberal Party returned to power in 1931 in coalition with the Conservatives and National Labour as part of MacDonald&#x27;s National Government, it was expected that Birkett would be offered the position being a Liberal Member of Parliament, but by the time they proposed candidates for Solicitor General, the Liberals had exceeded their ministerial quota agreed to in the coalition. Birkett was offered a non-legal office but said that he &quot;could not contemplate a post that meant giving up my practice&quot;.

After an economic crisis in 1931, the King dissolved parliament and Birkett returned to Nottingham East to defend his seat; his main opponent was the Conservative, Louis Gluckstein, who had challenged him in the 1929 election. The Conservative Party&#x27;s support of protectionism met with approval from the electorate, as most were employed in industries which had suffered after the institution of free trade. Gluckstein won the general election on 27 October 1931 with a majority of 5,583 votes.

On 3 November, Birkett was informed that if he had been returned, the Prime Minister intended to make him Solicitor-General. Disillusioned with the circumstances of the election, Birkett &quot;[bade] farewell to East Nottingham&quot; and retired from politics. He was invited to become a Liberal candidate two more times; once in 1931 for Torquay and once in 1932 for North Cornwall. The second was a tempting offer; the seat had become vacant on the death of its previous holder, a National Liberal with a comfortable majority, and it was felt that Birkett was almost certain to be returned to Parliament. Despite this, he refused, disliking the National Liberal policies and the extent to which they had aligned themselves with the Conservative Party.

===Return to the Bar===
In 1930, Birkett was involved in the so-called Blazing Car murder case. On 6 November 1930, two men returning home in Northampton noticed a bright light in the distance and saw a man come out of a ditch at the side of the road, glance back toward the light and say &quot;looks like somebody has had a bonfire&quot;. The two young men ran toward the light, saw it was a burning car and fetched a policeman. When the fires died away, a body was found inside the boot of a car with a face so charred it was impossible to determine the identity of the man; the numberplate of the car was intact, however, and traced to an Alfred Arthur Rouse. Rouse was arrested and appeared at Northampton Crown Court on 26 January 1931, charged with the murder of an unknown man. He was defended by Donald Finnemore, and the Crown was represented by Birkett and Richard Elwes. Rouse was damned by a series of events. When arrested, he made statements such as &quot;I&#x27;m very glad it&#x27;s over&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m responsible&quot; and that the car engine had been off at the time of the fire, ruling out the possibility of accidental ignition. When he appeared as a witness, the defendant claimed that after giving an unknown man a lift, he had found that he was running out of petrol and had asked the passenger to take the spare can in the car and fill up the fuel tank. While he was doing this, Rouse testified that he went to the side of the road to urinate, and while there heard a large explosion. He said he saw a large flame and became convinced the petrol tank would explode. As such he ran away as fast as possible, at which point he ran into the two young men on the road.

The cross-examination of him and other witnesses by Birkett swayed the jury, and they took only fifteen minutes to find Rouse guilty of murder. After his appeal had been rejected by both the Court of Appeal and the Home Secretary, Rouse admitted that he had in fact committed the murder – although he never gave a reason – it was theorised that he had done so in an attempt to fake his own death. Despite his admission of guilt the identity of the victim has never been discovered.

In 1934, Birkett acted as counsel for the second of the two Brighton trunk murders, a case which was described as &quot;his greatest triumph in a capital case&quot;. In June 1934, a woman&#x27;s torso was found in a suitcase in Brighton railway station. The legs were discovered at King&#x27;s Cross station the next day, but her head and arms were never found, and the case is still unsolved. A woman by the name of Violette Kaye had disappeared, and the appearance of the first woman&#x27;s body prompted greater scrutiny on Kaye&#x27;s case. On 14 July, they interviewed Toni Mancini, Kaye&#x27;s boyfriend, who convinced them that the dead woman could not possibly be Kaye; the dead woman had been identified as around thirty five years old and five months pregnant, while Kaye was ten years older. Kaye was last seen alive on 10 May looking distressed in the doorway to her house and had been scheduled to visit her sister in London who received a telegram on 11 May reading &quot;Going abroad. Good job. Sail Sunday. Will write. Vi.&quot; in block capitals. The post office clerks could not remember who sent it, but experts testified that the handwriting on the telegram had similarities to that on a menu written by Mancini. On 14 May, with the help of another man, Mancini moved his belongings from the house he shared with Kaye, which included a large trunk which was too heavy to move by hand. Mancini had told people that he had broken up with Kaye and she had moved to Paris, and that before she left he had beaten her. He later said to a friend, &quot;What is the good of knocking a woman about with your fists? You only hurt yourself. You should hit her with a hammer same as I did and [chop] her up.&quot; A hammerhead was later found in the rubbish at his old house.

After the police had left on 14 July, Mancini got on a train to London. When the police arrived the next morning, they were unable to find Mancini but found Kaye&#x27;s body decomposing in the trunk in his new home. They immediately sent out a country-wide call for Mancini to be arrested, and he was picked up near London. He claimed he was not guilty, and stated during interviews with police that he had returned home to find Kaye dead. Fearing that with his criminal record, the police would not believe him, he had hidden the body in a trunk. While Mancini was in prison, his solicitor phoned Birkett and asked him to work as counsel for the defence, which Birkett agreed to do. In his defence, Birkett highlighted flaws in the prosecution&#x27;s case to introduce an element of doubt in the minds of the jury. His cross-examination of Sir Bernard Spilsbury, famous Home Office pathologist and potentially the most dangerous witness for the Crown, was seen as &quot;masterly&quot;. Birkett also emphasised the affectionate nature of the relationship between Kaye and Mancini before Kaye&#x27;s death. Despite strong evidence that he had committed the crime, including marks on the victim&#x27;s skull believed to be from a hammer and marks of blood on Mancini&#x27;s clothing, the jury found Mancini not guilty after two and a half hours of deliberations. Mancini confessed to the murder before dying.

In March 1936, Birkett defended Dr Buck Ruxton over the infamous Jigsaw Murders. Ruxton was found guilty of murdering his wife, Isabella, and their children&#x27;s nanny, Mary Rogerson, before dismembering their bodies and disposing of the parts in a ravine at Moffat, in the Scottish Borders. Ruxton was hanged at Strangeways Prison in May 1936.

In May 1937 Birkett was appointed Chairman of the Inter-Departmental Committee for Abortion set up by the Minister of Health and Home Secretary, preparing a report &quot;to inquire into the prevalence of abortion, and the law relating thereto, and to consider what steps can be taken by more effective enforcement of the law&quot;, something which occupied him for two years. During the summer of 1937, Birkett was asked to represent the English Bar at the annual meeting of the Canadian Bar Association in Toronto, where he was a popular speaker. In January 1938, he was asked to act as a Commissioner of Assize to open the Assize Court in Aylesbury, dealing with an average of 10 cases a day. After the outbreak of World War II in 1939, he became a member of a committee advising the Home Secretary on the detention of suspected enemy agents. The committee dealt with more than 1,500 cases in two years. Although the work was unpaid, he was knighted (as a Knight Bachelor) on 6 June 1941 as a reward for his work. He also delivered weekly radio broadcasts after the Friday night news to counter the broadcasts of William Joyce, known as Lord Haw Haw. The first broadcast took place on 9 February 1940, and they were considered to be a morale boost during the so-called Phoney War.

==Judicial work==
Birkett had been offered appointment to the High Court as early as 1928, but turned it down, saying that &quot;I wasn&#x27;t really drawn to the judicial office... I loved the Bar too much&quot;. After the death of the High Court judge Sir Anthony Hawke in October 1941, the Lord Chancellor Lord Simon offered Birkett the seat. Birkett considered it his &quot;public duty&quot; to join the bench and wrote back on 4 November accepting the offer. He was sworn in on 11 November 1941 and first sat on 24 November. He did not enjoy his time in the high courts, admitting that he &quot;missed the limelight&quot; of being an advocate, and, combined with ill-health, he suffered from depression in 1942. He was, however, a popular judge, although he felt he was too weak in his judgments because he &quot;did not desire to hurt people&#x27;s feelings&quot;. At one point, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; reported he was to be made Viceroy of India. For several weeks in 1943, he sat in the Court of Appeal before departing on an Assize visit. He fell ill after a few weeks with a combination of heart disease and pneumonia, and he returned home to recover. He suffered from more illness over the next year and considered resigning as a judge, as he felt that he could no longer trust his abilities as one. During his time in the High Court, he dealt with several notable cases including &quot;Constantine v Imperial Hotels Ltd&quot;, which reaffirmed the common law principle that innkeepers must not refuse accommodation to guests without just cause.

===Nuremberg trials===
On 30 August 1945, Birkett received a letter from the Lord Chancellor asking him to serve as the British judge at the Nuremberg Trials of German War Criminals. He accepted, saying that it was &quot;a great honour to be selected&quot;. But when he went to London to discuss it, he was informed that the Foreign Office wanted a more senior judge to be in attendance, ideally a Law Lord, but since no Law Lord was available, they had requested that a judge from the Court of Appeal should be appointed. Geoffrey Lawrence was made the main British judge, and Birkett was offered the position of alternate judge for the trials, which he accepted, although with less enthusiasm than he had shown when accepting the original offer. He became friends with the American judge Francis Biddle, although when they first met he accidentally confused him with Anthony Drexel Biddle and remarked how useful his diplomatic training would be in the trials.

The trial lasted from 18 October 1945 to 30 September 1946, and although Birkett did not have a vote in the proceedings as an alternate judge, his opinion was given weight, and it helped sway the decisions made by the main judges. After returning home from the trials, he received praise from both the Lord Chancellor, who said that &quot;The country owes much to him for vindicating our conceptions of an impartial trial under the rule of law&quot;, and from John Parker, the American alternate judge, who wrote that:

Although only an alternate member of the tribunal without a vote, his voice was heard in all of its deliberations, his hand drafted a large and most important part of its judgment, and no one connected with the tribunal, member or otherwise, had a greater part than he in shaping the final result. If, as I confidently believe, the work of the tribunal will constitute a landmark in the development of world order based on law, to Norman Birkett must go a large share of the credit for the success of the undertaking. To few men does the opportunity come to labour so mightily for the welfare of their kind.
After the judges returned home, Lawrence was made a Baron for his work at Nuremberg, but Birkett received nothing. The lack of reward for his work pushed him into depression, which he took many months to recover from. He was eventually made a Privy Counsellor in the 1947 Birthday Honours list, but he saw this as poor reward for the work he had put in at Nuremberg.

===Further judicial work===
The rest of his time in the High Court passed uneventfully, but he continued to be unhappy with his work as a judge, noting that &quot;I am nervous of myself, without much confidence in my judgment and hesitant about my sentences and damages and things of that kind. I have felt no glow of achievement in any summing up, though none of them have been bad.&quot;

He was again struck by depression in 1948 when Sir Alfred Thompson Denning and Sir John Singleton were both appointed to the Court of Appeal ahead of him, despite having been appointed to the High Court after him. On 30 July 1949, Birkett went to the Lord Chancellor and discussed the possibility of his appointment to the Court of Appeal, but left dissatisfied. On 14 November, a duodenal ulcer perforated, from which he spent six months recovering. In an attempt to appease him, the Lord Chancellor offered Birkett a peerage without salary on 8 May 1950, but he refused as he lacked the means to survive without paid employment. While speaking at a conference in Washington, D.C., on 31 August 1950, he received a telegram from the Lord Chancellor offering him appointment to the Court of Appeal; he immediately wired back his acceptance. He was sworn in on 2 October, and heard his first case the following day.

He found the work in the Court of Appeal dull, and his disappointment increased the longer he worked. As in the High Court, he felt uncertain about his judgements and unsure as to whether he was affecting the law. Despite his personal opinion of himself, the judiciary as a whole felt that his mix of humanity and common sense was beneficial to the court. During the 1951 Long Vacation he broadcast three talks for the BBC on the subject of international law and its growth and gave a speech for the Law Society titled &quot;The Lawyer&#x27;s Contribution to Society&quot;. Despite his unhappiness with his work in the Court of Appeal, he worked until 1956, when his long service as a judge allowed him to draw a pension. In his remaining time in the Court of Appeal, Birkett judged several notable cases, in particular &quot;Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v Boots Cash Chemists (Southern) Ltd&quot; [1953] 1 QB 401, and &quot;Entores Ltd v Miles Far East Corporation&quot; [1955] 2 QB 327, where the court made a landmark decision on acceptance of a contract in relation to Telex.

==Retirement==
On 13 June 1957 he became chairman of a committee of Privy Counsellors holding an inquiry into the Home Secretary&#x27;s use of telephone tapping. After twenty-nine meetings, Birkett drafted a report which he passed on to Parliament supporting the use of telephone taps and noting their effectiveness. On 9 December, a letter arrived from the Prime Minister offering him a peerage. He accepted, and his name appeared in the 1958 New Years Honours list; created Baron Birkett, &quot;of Ulverston in the County of Lancaster&quot;, and took his seat in the House of Lords on 20 February 1958. In the same year, he was awarded a LLD by the University of Cambridge, where the speaker said that Birkett was &quot;endowed with such a voice as Cicero declared to be first requisite of an orator&quot; and that &quot;in our own time there had been no one more skilled in swaying the mind of a jury.&quot; In February 1959, he appeared on the first episode of the BBC television program &quot;Face to Face&quot;, where he was described as &quot;one of the three or four greatest criminal lawyers of this century, and perhaps one of the three or four greatest criminal lawyers of all time&quot;. Outside politics and the law, he also served as Master of the Worshipful Company of Curriers four times.

Birkett tried to sit as regularly in the House of Lords as possible, and made his maiden speech on 8 April 1959 on the subject of crime in the United Kingdom. In May, he moved the first reading of the Obscene Publications Bill, which passed with support from both sides of the house. Privately, Birkett believed that &quot;there will never be a satisfactory law in England about obscenity. Our 1959 Act is the best we have yet done.&quot; In 1961, he was again invited by the BBC to give a series of talks on the BBC Home Service, this time titled &quot;Six Great Advocates&quot;. He picked Edward Marshall Hall, Patrick Hastings, Edward Clarke, Rufus Isaacs, Charles Russell and Thomas Erskine. He sat for the last time in the House of Lords on 8 February 1962, where he made a speech criticising an element of the Manchester Corporation Bill which would have water drained from Ullswater to meet the needs of the growing population in Manchester. His speech was &quot;deeply felt and eloquent&quot;, and when the votes were announced, Birkett and his supporters had won by 70 votes to 36. The Ullswater Yacht Club now holds an annual Lord Birkett Memorial Trophy Race on the lake.

The next morning he complained of heart trouble, collapsed shortly after lunch and was taken to the hospital. The doctors discovered that he had ruptured an important blood vessel and immediate surgery was needed to fix it. The operation failed to fix the problem, and he died early in the morning on 10 February 1962. His son, Michael, succeeded him as Baron Birkett.

<text>HMS &quot;Formidable&quot; was an ordered for the Royal Navy before the Second World War. After being completed in late 1940, she was briefly assigned to the Home Fleet before being transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet as a replacement for her crippled sister ship . &quot;Formidable&quot;″s aircraft played a key role in the Battle of Cape Matapan in early 1941, and they subsequently provided cover for Allied ships and attacked Axis forces until their carrier was badly damaged by German dive bombers in May.

Assigned to the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean in early 1942, &quot;Formidable&quot; covered the invasion of Diego Suarez in Vichy Madagascar in mid-1942 against the possibility of a sortie by the Japanese into the Indian Ocean. &quot;Formidable&quot; returned home for a brief refit before participating in Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa in November. She remained in the Mediterranean and covered the invasions of Sicily and mainland Italy in 1943 before beginning a lengthy refit.

&quot;Formidable&quot; made several attacks on the in Norway in mid-1944 as part of the Home Fleet. She was subsequently assigned to the British Pacific Fleet (BPF) in 1945 where she played a supporting role during the Battle of Okinawa and later attacked targets in the Japanese Home Islands. The ship was used to repatriate liberated Allied prisoners of war and soldiers after the Japanese surrender and then ferried British personnel across the globe through 1946. She was placed in reserve the following year and sold for scrap in 1953.

==Background and description==

The Royal Navy&#x27;s 1936 Naval Programme authorised the construction of two aircraft carriers. Admiral Sir Reginald Henderson, Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy, was determined not to simply modify the previous unarmoured design. He believed that carriers could not be successfully defended by their own aircraft without some form of early-warning system. Lacking that, there was nothing to prevent land-based aircraft from attacking them, especially in confined waters like the North and Mediterranean Seas. This meant that the ship had to be capable of remaining in action after sustaining damage, and that her fragile aircraft had to be protected entirely from damage. The only way to do this was to completely armour the hangar in which the aircraft would shelter, but putting that much weight so high in the ship allowed only a single-storey hangar due to stability concerns. This halved the aircraft capacity of the &quot;Illustrious&quot; class compared with the older unarmoured carriers, trading offensive potential for defensive survivability.

&quot;Formidable&quot; had a length of overall and at the waterline. Her beam was at the waterline and she had a draught of at deep load. She displaced at standard load as completed. Her complement was approximately 1,299 men upon completion in 1940. The ship had three Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one shaft using steam supplied by six Admiralty 3-drum boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , enough to give a maximum speed of . On sea trials, &quot;Formidable&quot; reached with . She carried a maximum of of fuel oil, which gave her a range of at .

The armoured flight deck had a usable length of , due to prominent &quot;round-downs&quot; at bow and stern to reduce air turbulence, and a maximum width of . A single hydraulic aircraft catapult was fitted on the forward part of the flight deck. The ship was equipped with two unarmoured lifts on the centreline, each of which measured . The hangar was long and had a maximum width of . It had a height of , which allowed storage of Lend-Lease Vought F4U Corsair fighters once their wingtips were clipped. The ship could accommodate up to 54 aircraft rather than the intended 36 after the adoption of &quot;outriggers&quot; on the flight deck during the war and the flattening of the &quot;round-downs&quot; that increased the usable length of the flight deck to to facilitate the use of a permanent deck park. The additional crewmen, maintenance personnel and facilities needed to support the extra aircraft severely crowded the ship. She was provided with of petrol.

===Armament, electronics and protection===
The ship&#x27;s main armament consisted of sixteen quick-firing (QF)  dual-purpose guns in eight twin-gun turrets that were mounted in sponsons on the side of the hull. The roofs of the gun turrets protruded above the level of the flight deck to allow them to fire across the deck at high elevations. The gun had a maximum range of . Her light anti-aircraft defences consisted of six octuple mounts for QF two-pounder 2 pdr () (&quot;pom-pom&quot;) anti-aircraft (AA) guns, two each fore and aft of the island and two in sponsons on the port side of the hull. The two-pounder gun had a maximum range of .

While under repair in late 1941, &quot;Formidable&quot;″s light AA armament was augmented by the addition of 10 Oerlikon autocannon in single mounts with a maximum range of . By the time of her last recorded refit in March 1944, she had exchanged one octuple &quot;pom-pom&quot; mount for a quadruple mount and had a total of 20 twin and 14 single 20 mm mounts. Before seeing combat against the Japanese, some were replaced by Bofors AA guns as the 20 mm shell was unlikely to destroy a kamikaze before it hit the ship. The Bofors gun had a maximum range of . By the war&#x27;s end the ship had all six of her original octuple &quot;pom-pom&quot; mounts, five single 40 mm power-operated mounts, seven single 40 mm &quot;Boffin&quot; mounts and 11 twin and 12 single 20 mm mounts.

&quot;Formidable&quot; was completed with a Type 79 early-warning radar. The specifics of the additional radars fitted during the war are not readily available, but she probably had, by the end of the war, a Type 277 surface-search/height-finding radar on top of the bridge and a Type 293 target-indicator radar on the foremast. She also probably mounted Type 279 and Type 281B early-warning radars, based on those fitted aboard her sister ship . In addition, Type 282 and Type 285 gunnery radars were mounted on the fire-control directors.

The &quot;Illustrious&quot;-class ships had a flight deck protected by of armour, and the internal sides and ends of the hangars were 4.5 inches thick. The hangar deck itself was thick and extended the full width of the ship to meet the top of the 4.5-inch waterline armour belt. The belt was closed by 2.5-inch transverse bulkheads fore and aft. The underwater defence system was a layered system of liquid- and air-filled compartments backed by a splinter bulkhead.

==Construction and service==

&quot;Formidable&quot; was ordered as part of the 1937 Naval Programme from Harland &amp; Wolff. She was laid down at their Belfast shipyard on 17 June 1937 as yard number 1007 and launched on 17 August 1939. Just before the launch ceremony was to begin, the wooden cradle supporting the ship collapsed, and the ship slid down the slipway while workmen were still underneath and around the ship. One spectator was killed by flying debris and at least 20 others were injured; &quot;Formidable&quot;, however, was not damaged. Because of the incident, the carrier was referred to as &quot;The Ship That Launched Herself&quot;. She was commissioned on 24 November 1940.

After a very brief work up, the Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers of 826 Naval Air Squadron and 829 Squadron and the Fairey Fulmar fighters of 803 Squadron flew aboard and she joined the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow on 12 December. Her stay there was brief as she, escorted by the heavy cruisers and , sailed on 18 December to protect convoys and search for the , which had recently attacked Convoy HX 84 in the North Atlantic. They failed to find the commerce raider and escorted a convoy to Cape Town, South Africa, arriving on 22 January 1941. Four days later the ship was ordered north to replace her sister &quot;Illustrious&quot; with the Mediterranean Fleet after she had been badly damaged by German dive bombers. En route, she took the opportunity to attack Italian forces in Italian Somaliland and Eritrea. They sank the steamer on 12 February for the loss of two Albacores.

===Battle of Cape Matapan===

Several weeks later, she made a cautious transit of the recently mined Suez Canal and reached Alexandria on 10 March. 829 Squadron was issued Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers to replace its losses. On 20 March &quot;Formidable&quot; escorted a convoy to Malta and flew off five aircraft for Crete while returning to Alexandria. On the morning of 27 March, major elements of the Italian Fleet were spotted en route to the sea lanes between Egypt and Greece and the carrier sailed later that afternoon with a force of three battleships, cruisers and destroyers under the command of Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham. Reinforced by three Fulmars from 806 Squadron, her air group numbered 13 Fulmars, 10 Albacores and 4 Swordfish. An Albacore spotted the leading Italian ships the next morning and six Albacores with torpedoes attacked . Two German Junkers Ju 88 bombers intervened, but they were driven off by the escorting pair of Fulmars. The attack failed and another strike force of three Albacores and two Swordfish was prepared. Shortly after launching them at 12:22, &quot;Formidable&quot; was attacked by a pair of torpedo-carrying Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers to no effect. Around 14:50, one Albacore torpedoed the Italian battleship, although the other aircraft missed. The hit briefly knocked out her engines and caused heavy flooding. Another air strike of six Albacores and two Swordfish was launched at 17:30 to finish off the battleship, but they mistook the for it in the fading light. 

The cruiser was struck by a torpedo from one of the aircraft, possibly from one of two Swordfish from 815 Squadron from Maleme, Crete, that joined &quot;Formidable&quot;″s aircraft before the attack. The mistake allowed the battleship to reach port. One Albacore was shot down by &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; and two others were forced to ditch after running out of fuel. Cunningham continued the pursuit of the Italian ships into the night. Unaware of the British pursuit, a squadron of cruisers and destroyers was ordered to return and help &quot;Pola&quot;. This squadron included &quot;Pola&quot;″s sister ships, &quot;Zara&quot; and &quot;Fiume&quot; while &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; and the other ships continued to Taranto. In the darkness and without radar the Italian cruisers were surprised and the three battleships plus &quot;Formidable&quot; were able to close to and open fire. After three minutes, &quot;Fiume&quot; and &quot;Zara&quot; had been destroyed. &quot;Formidable&quot; which was third in line behind and and ahead of received the order to open fire with her 4.5-inch guns although the order was almost immediately countermanded and she was ordered out of line to starboard as soon as it was realised such a valuable ship was so close to the Italian ships. Some of &quot;Formidable&quot;″s 4.5-inch guns fired a salvo in what was one of the few occasions in the Second World War in which an aircraft carrier fired her main armament at enemy warships.

On 18 April the Mediterranean Fleet sortied to bombard the primary Axis supply port of Tripoli and was attacked by a pair of SM.79 torpedo bombers from Rhodes. The torpedo-bombers were intercepted by a pair of Fulmars that damaged one bomber badly enough that it crash-landed back at its base, although one Fulmar was also forced to crash-land aboard &quot;Formidable&quot;. The next day Fulmars from 806 Squadron shot down one CANT Z.1007 bomber flying from Cyrenica to Sicily and a pair of Junkers Ju 52 transports flying fuel to North Africa. On the morning of 21 April, the carrier&#x27;s aircraft dropped flares to illuminate the port so it could be shelled by three battleships and a light cruiser. On the way home, a pair of Fulmars shot down a Dornier Do 24 flying boat.
During the Evacuation of Greece, &quot;Formidable&quot; provided air cover for Convoy GA 15 on 29 April. A Fulmar from 803 Squadron was forced to ditch on 2 May before the carrier returned to Alexandria the next day. She put to sea on 6 May to provide air cover for the convoys involved in Operation Tiger. On the morning of 8 May, a pair of Fulmars claimed to have shot down a pair of Z.1007s searching for the fleet; one Fulmar failed to return. Later that afternoon, the fighters shot down four German Heinkel He 111 bombers at the cost of one Fulmar forced to crash-land. Two Albacores and a Fulmar crashed due to non-combat causes during the day. The next day a pair of Fulmars from 806 Squadron badly damaged a Ju 88 reconnaissance bomber that crash-landed at its base in Sicily. As the fleet and the Tiger convoy approached Alexandria on 11 May, a pair of Fulmars attacked a formation of Ju 88s, damaging one bomber; one Fulmar and another Ju 88 were seen falling together towards the sea. Many of the Fulmars had been rendered unserviceable during the operation and &quot;Formidable&quot; was unable to provide air cover until they were repaired.

On 26 May the fleet sortied for a dawn raid on the base at Scarpanto the next day; the carrier mustered 12 Fulmars and 15 Albacores and Swordfish. Six Albacores and four Fulmars attacked the airbase, destroying one Ju 88 and damaging two others. Also damaged were an Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 transport and six Fiat CR.42 Falco fighters. Later that morning, as the fleet was returning to Egypt, the Fulmars shot down a He 111 and two Ju 88s for the loss of one Fulmar forced to land aboard the carrier and another forced to ditch. At 13:10 a formation of Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers was spotted from II./StG 2; based in Cyrenaica; they were searching for supply ships bound for Tobruk and not involved in the Battle of Crete. They hit &quot;Formidable&quot; with two bombs and blew the bow off her escorting destroyer . The bombs killed 12 men and wounded 10; one bomb passed completely through the outer part of the starboard forward flight deck and detonated before it hit the water, riddling the side of the hull with holes. A near miss also blew a large hole in the ship&#x27;s starboard side underwater. The pair of Fulmars on Combat Air Patrol (CAP) shot down one of the Stukas after it had dropped its bomb and were able to land aboard shortly afterwards but take-offs could not be made until 18:00.

&quot;Formidable&quot; arrived at Alexandria the following day and disembarked her air group. She received emergency repairs before departing on 24 July for permanent repairs at Norfolk Navy Yard in the United States, 829 Squadron flying aboard with its Albacores to provide anti-submarine patrols during the voyage. She arrived on 25 August, and the repairs were completed in early December. After several days of sea trials, she sailed for Britain in company with &quot;Illustrious&quot; on 12 December. During the night of 15/16 December, &quot;Illustrious&quot; collided with &quot;Formidable&quot;″s stern, but neither ship was seriously damaged. She was repaired at Belfast from 21 December 1941 to 3 February 1942 and embarked the Albacores of 818 Squadron and 820 Squadron and the Grumman Martlet fighters of 888 Squadron.

===Indian Ocean Raid===

&quot;Formidable&quot; sailed on 17 February to join the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean, escorting a convoy to Freetown, Sierra Leone, en route. One of her passengers on the voyage was Admiral Sir James Somerville, about to take up his appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Fleet. The ship arrived at Colombo, Ceylon, on 24 March and Somerville hoisted his flag aboard the battleship that same day. Two days after &quot;Formidable&quot;″s arrival, the Japanese First Air Fleet departed from Celebes (Sulawesi) in the Dutch East Indies to attack British forces in the Indian Ocean. Somerville was notified that the Japanese were planning to attack Ceylon on 28 March and ordered his fleet to assemble southeast of the island on 30 March to intercept them. Force A, consisting of &quot;Formidable&quot;, her sister and &quot;Warspite&quot;, was ordered to Addu Atoll to refuel on 3 April after the Japanese failed to attack as the British expected. A Royal Air Force Consolidated Catalina flying boat spotted them within range of Ceylon just three and a half hours after Force A arrived at the atoll on 4 April. Too far away to intercept them before they could attack Ceylon, Force A departed about eleven hours after arrival on a course that Somerville thought would allow him to attack by night while avoiding detection during the day. One of &quot;Indomitable&quot;″s Albacores spotted some of the Japanese carriers just before nightfall on 5 April, after the Japanese attacked Colombo, but further searches failed to locate them until 8 April when the Japanese were one day away from their intended target, Trincomalee, and still too far away to intercept. Force A refuelled at Addu Atoll on 9 April and was then ordered to Bombay to calm fears of a Japanese attack on India&#x27;s west coast.

Somerville was still uneasy about the possibility of another attack on Ceylon and ordered Force A to Kilindini Harbour, Mombasa, Kenya, on 24 April. En route (5–7 May), Force A helped protect the invasion of Vichy Diego Suarez, Madagascar, against a Japanese attack. &quot;Formidable&quot; arrived at Kilindini on 10 May and remained there until she departed on 29 May bound for Colombo. The ship alternated between Colombo and Kilindini for the rest of her time with the Eastern Fleet. During this time she took part in Operation Stab, a decoy invasion of the Andaman Islands, with &quot;Illustrious&quot;. Rear-Admiral Denis Boyd hoisted his flag over the ship on 24 August and she departed six days later to return home for a refit. She arrived at Rosyth on 21 September and her refit lasted until 18 October. She sailed that day for Scapa Flow where she embarked 24 Martlets of 888 and 893 Squadrons, 12 Albacores of 820 Squadron and 6 Supermarine Seafire fighters of 885 Squadron in preparation for the invasion of French North Africa.

===Operation Torch===
Assigned to Force H for Operation Torch, &quot;Formidable&quot; sailed on 30 October and provided cover in the Western Mediterranean against any attempt to interfere with the landings by Axis forces in Italy or France. Her Martlets shot down a pair of Ju 88s on 6 November and her Albacores laid a smoke screen in support of the landings at Algiers on 8 November. Two of her Albacores torpedoed and sank the on 17 November, after it had surrendered to a Supermarine Walrus amphibian which then departed the scene. She remained off the Algerian coast providing air support for Allied forces for the rest of the month, and one of her Seafires shot down a Ju 88 on 28 November.

&quot;Formidable&quot; was the only carrier in the Mediterranean after Torch until she was joined by &quot;Indomitable&quot; in mid-June 1943 as part of the buildup for the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky). The two carriers were east of the island in a position to intercept any attempt by the Italian fleet to attack the landings. After Sicily was secured, &quot;Formidable&quot; became the first carrier to enter Grand Harbour, Malta, since &quot;Illustrious&quot; in January 1941. The latter ship joined &quot;Formidable&quot; as a replacement for the torpedoed &quot;Indomitable&quot; in Force H for the landings at Salerno (Operation Avalanche) on 9 September. As in Husky, their role was to protect the invasion fleet from interference by the Italian Navy. The fighters aboard the smaller carriers protecting the forces ashore suffered heavy attrition during the early days of the operation and &quot;Formidable&quot; transferred 2 Seafires and 15 Martlets to as replacements for their losses.

===Norwegian operations===

In October, the carrier was transferred to the Home Fleet and departed Gibraltar for Greenock on 13 October together with the battleship . Six days later she was in Scapa Flow to begin patrols to Iceland in company with the battleships and and the American carrier that lasted for the next three weeks. On 13 November she flew off her air group and sailed for Belfast to begin a lengthy refit, arriving on 19 November. The refit was completed in early June and the ship spent the rest of the month working up. The 18 Corsairs of 1841 Squadron and the 24 Fairey Barracuda torpedo bombers of 827 Squadron and 830 Squadrons flew aboard on 29 June and &quot;Formidable&quot; sailed for Scapa Flow to train with the carriers and before launching an attack on the &quot;Tirpitz&quot; in Kaafjord on 17 July (Operation Mascot). Her Corsairs escorted the strike aircraft from the other carriers to the target; one was shot down by German flak. A smoke screen prevented most of the Barracudas from seeing their target and they failed to hit the &quot;Tirpitz&quot;. Upon the ship&#x27;s return to Scapa Flow, 827 and 830 Squadrons were replaced by 826 and 828 Squadrons, also flying Barracudas.

&quot;Formidable&quot;″s air group was reinforced by a dozen Corsairs of 1842 Squadron on 7 August in preparation for further attacks on &quot;Tirpitz&quot; (Operation Goodwood). The two Corsair squadrons were assigned to No. 6 Naval Fighter Wing aboard the carrier on 14 August. The first attack was on the morning of 22 August when &quot;Formidable&quot; launched 24 Corsairs and 12 Barracudas against the German battleship and nearby targets, all of which returned. A smoke screen again protected the &quot;Tirpitz&quot; and no damage was inflicted. Another attack scheduled for the afternoon had to be cancelled because of low clouds. A further attack could not be mounted until 24 August because of bad weather. The carrier contributed 23 Corsairs and 16 Barracudas, and 3 of the fighters were shot down over the target. The &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was lightly damaged by two bomb hits during this attack. A final attack was made five days later, again without effect.

The carrier arrived at Scapa Flow on 2 September where both Barracuda squadrons disembarked. She later sailed to Gibraltar, arriving on 21 September to begin a refit that, among other things, augmented her anti-aircraft outfit in preparation for operations in the Pacific. The Corsairs of No. 6 Naval Fighter Wing flew aboard on 1 January 1945, as did 18 Grumman TBF Avengers of 848 Squadron. After several weeks of working up, &quot;Formidable&quot; departed Gibraltar on 14 January to join the British Pacific Fleet (BPF). She arrived in Sydney, the BPF&#x27;s main base, on 10 March after several stops en route to refuel and embark stores and ammunition. On 20 March, Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser, commander of the BPF, inspected the ship and her crew.

===Pacific operations===
By this time &quot;Formidable&quot;″s air group had a strength of 36 Corsairs and 18 Avengers. She arrived in San Pedro Bay in the Philippines on 4 April to await the return of the BPF from their efforts to neutralise airfields on the Sakishima Islands, between Okinawa and Formosa, as part of the preparations for the landings on Okinawa. &quot;Formidable&quot; was called forward six days later to join the 1st Aircraft Carrier Squadron (1st ACS) of the BPF on operations as a replacement for &quot;Illustrious&quot;, which was in poor mechanical shape. She arrived on 14 April and contributed aircraft when the attacks recommenced two days later. The commander of 1842 Squadron was killed on the first day of operations while strafing buildings at Nobara airfield. After refuelling and two more days&#x27; attacks, the BPF sailed on 20 April for San Pedro Bay to replenish its ships for further operations.

The fleet returned to waters off Okinawa on 4 May and renewed its attacks on the airfields on the Sakishima Islands. Vice-Admiral Bernard Rawlings, second in command of the BPF, and his staff had determined that bombardment of Japanese gun positions by the heavy guns of battleships and cruisers might be a more effective method of destroying them than aerial attack. They detached &quot;King George V&quot; and &quot;Howe&quot;, as well as five cruisers, that morning to bombard Nobara and Hirara airfields of Miyako Island while fighters flew a protective CAP over them and spotted the fall of their shells. The loss of the most effective anti-aircraft ships was more important than anticipated and the Japanese were able to take advantage of the opportunity. The carrier had just launched two Corsairs for bombardment-spotting duties and the deck park of eleven Avengers was being moved forward to allow aircraft to land when an undetected Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter attacked at 11:31. The Zero first strafed the flight deck before any of &quot;Formidable&quot;″s guns could open fire and then turned sharply to dive into the forward flight deck despite the ship&#x27;s hard turn to starboard. The fighter released a bomb shortly before it would have impacted the deck and was destroyed by the bomb&#x27;s blast, although the remnants of the Zero struck &quot;Formidable&quot;.

 The detonation of the bomb put a large dent in the flight deck, around by and deep, with a hole in the center and much spalling from the underside. It killed 2 officers and 6 ratings, wounding 55 other crewmen. A fragment from the flight-deck armour penetrated the hangar-deck armour and passed through the centre-boiler uptakes, the centre-boiler room itself, and an oil tank before it came to rest in the inner bottom. The fragment severed the steam pipes in the centre-boiler room and forced its evacuation, cutting the ship&#x27;s speed to . The blast on the flight deck blew the Avenger closest to it over the side and set another one on fire. Shrapnel from the blast peppered the island, causing the bulk of the casualties, and severed many electrical cables, including those for most of the ship&#x27;s radars. The fires on the flight deck and in the hangar were extinguished by 11:55, and seven Avengers and a Corsair which were damaged beyond repair were dumped over the side. The bomb struck at the intersection of three armour plates and dented the plates over an area . The dent was filled by wood and concrete and covered by thin steel plates tack-welded to the deck so that she was able to operate aircraft by 17:00 and steam at a speed of . Thirteen of her Corsairs had been airborne at the time of the attack and they operated from the other carriers for a time. The damage to the boiler room and its steam pipes was repaired so that the centre boilers could be reconnected to the engines at 02:00 the next day.
The bombardment significantly reduced Japanese aerial activity on 5 May, although several of &quot;Formidable&quot;″s Corsairs, temporarily operating from her sister &quot;Victorious&quot;, shot down a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft at an altitude of . That evening the fleet withdrew to refuel and was back on station on 8 May although heavy rains forced the cancellation of the planned air strikes. On 9 May, another kamikaze pilot, Yoshinari Kurose, penetrated the CAP at low altitude and crashed his plane into &quot;Formidable&quot;″s flight deck and deck park at 17:05. The impact did little damage to the ship, but caused an explosion and large fire that destroyed 18 of her aircraft. One crewman, Petty Officer George Hinkins, was killed and four were wounded. The carrier was able to resume operations fifty minutes later, but with only four Avengers and eleven Corsairs still serviceable. Rawlings decided to immediately withdraw to give &quot;Victorious&quot; and &quot;Formidable&quot; more time to make repairs and to replenish their depleted air groups. He also revised the deployment of the BPF to counter the new low-level tactics of the Japanese by stationing the battleships and cruisers closer to the carriers, keeping the carriers closer together, and positioning radar-picket cruisers in the most likely directions of attack.

The BPF returned to action on 12 May and no Japanese aircraft were seen or detected that day or the next. One of &quot;Formidable&quot;″s Avengers made a successful landing aboard &quot;Indomitable&quot; with only one landing gear leg extended and no flaps on 13 May. The BPF continued its routine of two days of operations alternating with one or two days to replenish its ships for the next several days with minimal interference by the Japanese. On the morning of 18 May, armourers were loading ammunition into aircraft when a Corsair&#x27;s guns were accidentally fired into an Avenger, which caught fire. The overhead fire sprinklers were immediately turned on, but the fire could not be extinguished for nearly an hour, not least because the electric motors driving the steel-fire curtains had been damaged in the first kamikaze attack and could only be repaired by a dockyard. Twenty-one Corsairs and seven Avengers were either damaged or destroyed in the incident. Rawlings decided to detach &quot;Formidable&quot; early to give her extra time for repairs in Sydney and she was ordered to depart on 22 May.

====Operations off the Japanese coast====
The ship arrived on 31 May and was taken into the Captain Cook Dock at the Garden Island Dockyard for repairs, with the dock&#x27;s labour force being augmented with workers from the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. Two of the three armour plates damaged on 4 May were repaired, but the third had to be replaced by two 1.5-inch high-quality steel plates as there were not any armour plates of the required thickness available in Australia. Repairs were also made to the ship&#x27;s machinery, boilers and electrical systems. The island was enlarged with an admiral&#x27;s staff cabin and a radar workshop. Rear-Admiral Sir Philip Vian, commander of the 1st ACS, transferred his flag to &quot;Formidable&quot; when her repairs were complete.

Together with &quot;Victorious&quot; and &quot;King George V&quot;, &quot;Formidable&quot; departed Sydney on 28 June, bound for the BPF&#x27;s advance base at Manus Island, in the Admiralty Islands. Her air group now consisted of 36 Corsairs, 12 Avengers and 6 Grumman F6F Hellcats of 1844 Squadron. Two of the latter aircraft were photoreconnaissance versions. No. 6 Naval Fighter Wing was absorbed into the 2nd Carrier Air Group that controlled all of the aircraft on the carrier. The ships arrived on 4 July, refuelled, and departed two days later to join the American Third Fleet, already operating off the Japanese Home Islands. The BPF rendezvoused with the Americans on 16 July and commenced operations the next morning. &quot;Formidable&quot; flew off 28 Corsairs bound north of Tokyo on 17 July, but some of them were unable to locate their targets because of bad weather. Twenty-four Corsairs attacked targets near Tokyo the next day, before more bad weather halted flying operations until 24–25 July, when the BPF&#x27;s aircraft attacked targets near Osaka and the Inland Sea, crippling the escort carrier . After replenishing, airstrikes resumed on 28 and 30 July, sinking the escort near Maizuru. A combination of bad weather, refuelling requirements and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima delayed the resumption of air operations until 9 August.

During the morning, &quot;Formidable&quot; flew off a fighter sweep of a dozen Corsairs followed an hour later by Avengers that attacked Matsushima Air Field. A second fighter sweep, led by Lieutenant Robert Hampton Gray, RCNVR, senior pilot of 1841 Squadron, was diverted to attack Japanese warships located in Onagawa Wan, Miyagi Prefecture, with his eight Corsairs. Gray spotted two escort ships and led his aircraft into the attack. Intense flak set his engine on fire, but Gray continued his attack, skip bombing a bomb into the &quot;Etorofu&quot;-class escort &quot;Amakusa&quot;. The ship sank within five minutes with the loss of 157 lives. Gray&#x27;s aircraft rolled inverted shortly after releasing the bomb and crashed into the sea; he did not survive. Gray was later posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross (VC).

The attacks were repeated the next day, sinking two warships and numerous small merchantmen and destroying numerous railway locomotives and parked aircraft. The BPF had been scheduled to withdraw after 10 August to prepare for Operation Olympic, the invasion of Kyushu scheduled for November, and the bulk of the force, including &quot;Formidable&quot;, departed for Manus on 12 August. The Japanese surrender a few days later ended the war.

===Post-war actions===

&quot;Formidable&quot; arrived at Sydney on 24 August, and had her hangar refitted to accommodate Allied ex-prisoners of war and soldiers for repatriation. Having left her air group behind to maximise the numbers of passengers she could carry, the ship arrived at Manila on 30 September, where she loaded over 1,000 Australian former prisoners of war on 4 October and unloaded them at Circular Quay in Sydney on 21 October. She departed three days later, bound for Karavia Bay, New Britain, where she loaded 1,254 men of the Indian Army and continued on to Singapore where she loaded Indian ex-PoWs before delivering them to Bombay. There &quot;Formidable&quot; loaded an Indian Army infantry battalion for transport to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies to maintain law and order until Dutch colonial troops could take over. The ship then loaded elements of the 7th Australian Division and their equipment at Tarakan Island, Borneo, and picked up more Australians at Morotai; she arrived at Sydney on 6 December.

Vice-Admiral Vian addressed the ship&#x27;s crew on 27 December before she departed the following day with 800 naval personnel embarked for passage home. She arrived at Portsmouth on 5 February 1946. The dockyard there fitted her with more permanent accommodations in the hangar for more trooping duties and she loaded 480 personnel before departing for Sydney on 2 March. &quot;Formidable&quot; arrived there a month later and loaded 1,336 naval personnel as well as some Wrens and VAD nurses. She sailed on 12 April, stopping in Colombo to refuel and drop off 576 naval personnel, before arriving in Devonport on 9 May. She made her next voyage to Bombay and Colombo between 15 June and 25 July. The ship loaded 114 officers, 958 ratings and 11 VAD nurses in Singapore in August and another 319 ratings in Trincomalee before stopping in Malta to load 41 men of the Merchant Navy. &quot;Formidable&quot; made her last trooping voyage between Portsmouth and Singapore, delivering 1,000 Royal Marine Commandos to the latter, between 3 December and 3 February 1947.

===Decommissioning and disposal===
In early March 1947, &quot;Formidable&quot; steamed north to Rosyth for a brief refit before being reduced to reserve. She was paid off on 12 August and a later survey revealed that her wartime damage and poor material shape meant the ship was beyond economical repair at a time when money was very tight. She was towed to Spithead in mid-1949 and then to Portsmouth Royal Dockyard in November 1952. &quot;Formidable&quot; was sold for scrap in January 1953 and towed to Inverkeithing where she was broken up.

<text>A shot glass is a glass originally designed to hold or measure spirits or liquor, which is either imbibed straight from the glass (&quot;a shot&quot;) or poured into a cocktail (&quot;a drink&quot;). An alcoholic beverage served in a shot glass and typically consumed quickly, in one gulp, may also be known as a &quot;shooter&quot; or “shot”.
Shot glasses decorated with a wide variety of toasts, advertisements, humorous pictures, or other decorations and words are popular souvenirs and collectibles, especially as merchandise of a brewery.

== Name origin ==

The word &quot;shot&quot;, meaning a drink of alcohol, has been used since at least the 17th century, taken from the Old English &#x27;sceot&#x27; and is related to the German word .

== Earliest examples ==

Some of the earliest whiskey glasses in America from the late 1700s to early 1800s were called &quot;whiskey tasters&quot; or &quot;whiskey tumblers&quot; and were hand blown. They are thick, similar to today&#x27;s shot glasses, but will show a pontil mark or scar on the bottom, or a cupped area on the bottom where the pontil mark was ground and polished off. Some of these glasses even have hand-applied handles and decorations hand crafted using a grinding wheel.

In the early to mid-1800s, glass blowers began to use molds and several different patterns of &quot;whiskey tasters&quot; in several different colors were being made in molds. These glasses are also thick like today&#x27;s shot glass but they will have rough pontiled bottoms from being hand blown into the mold. By the 1870s to 1890s as glass making technology improved, the rough pontiled bottoms largely disappeared from glasses and bottles.

== Shot-measuring tools ==

=== Jigger ===
A jigger, also known as a measure, is a bartending tool used to measure liquor, which is typically then poured into a glass or cocktail shaker.

The term &quot;jigger&quot; in the sense of a small cup or measure of spirits or wine originates in the U.S. in the early 19th century. Many references from the 1800s describe the &quot;jigger boss&quot; providing jiggers of whiskey to Irish immigrant workers who were digging canals in the U.S. Northeast.

The style of double-ended jigger common today, made of stainless steel with two unequal sized opposing cones in an hourglass shape, was patented in 1893 by Cornelius Dungan of Chicago. Typically, one cone measures a regulation single shot, and the other some fraction or multiple—with the actual sizes depending on local laws and customs.

In the U.S. up until Prohibition, a jigger was commonly known to be about half a gill, or , but starting in the latter part of the 20th century, it is typically interpreted to be . The jiggers used in the U.K. are typically and sometimes . Jiggers may also hold other amounts and ratios, and can vary depending on the region and date of manufacture. Many jiggers may also have fractional markings on the inside of the bowl, to facilitate smaller measures of liquid.

=== Measuring shot glass ===

A measuring shot glass is graduated in smaller units such as half-ounces, teaspoons, tablespoons, or millilitres. They are useful for precise measurement of cocktail ingredients, as well as in cooking recipes that call for multiples of a smaller unit (e.g. several teaspoons), allowing the dispensing of the amount in a single measure.

<doc id="485339" wikidata="Q685555" url="?curid=485339" title="Illustrious-class aircraft carrier">
<text>The &quot;Illustrious&quot; class was a class of aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy that included some of the most important British warships in the Second World War. They were laid down in the late 1930s as part of the rearmament of British forces in response to the emerging threats of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan.

The &quot;Illustrious&quot; class comprised four vessels: HM Ships &quot;Illustrious&quot;, &quot;Formidable&quot;, &quot;Victorious&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot;. The last of these was built to a modified design with a second, half-length, hangar deck below the main hangar deck. Each of these ships played a prominent part in the battles of the Second World War. &quot;Victorious&quot; took part in the pursuit of the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;, &quot;Illustrious&quot; and &quot;Formidable&quot; played prominent parts in the battles in the Mediterranean during 1940 and 1941 and all three took part in the large actions of the British Pacific Fleet in 1945.

The later two ships of the &quot;Implacable&quot; class were also built to modified designs to carry larger air wings. and both had two hangar levels, albeit with a limited head room.

==Design and concept==
The &quot;Illustrious&quot; class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. They were different in conception to the Royal Navy&#x27;s only modern carrier at the time, their predecessor HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, and what may be described as their nearest American contemporaries, the &quot;Yorktown&quot; and &quot;Essex&quot; class carriers. The &quot;Illustrious&quot; class followed the &quot;Yorktown&quot; but preceded the &quot;Essex&quot;, the latter being designed after the US abandonment of the Second London Naval Treaty and its tonnage limitations.

Where other designs emphasised large air groups as the primary means of defence, the &quot;Illustrious&quot; class relied on their anti-aircraft armament and the passive defence provided by an armoured flight deck for survival, resulting in a reduced aircraft complement. Other carriers had armour carried on lower decks (e.g. the hangar deck or main deck); the unprotected flight deck and the hangar below it formed part of the superstructure, and were unprotected against even small bombs. However, the hangar could be made larger and thus more aircraft could be carried, but the differences in aircraft capacity between these carriers and their United States Navy (USN) counterparts is largely due to the some 100-foot-longer overall length of the US designs, and the USN&#x27;s operational doctrine, which allowed for a permanent deck park of aircraft to augment their hangar capacity. &quot;Illustrious&quot;″s hangar was 82% as large as ″s, but &quot;Enterprise&quot; typically carried 30% of her aircraft capacity in her deck park. &quot;Indomitable&quot;″s two hangars were actually larger than &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s, but she carried fewer aircraft because she did not have a large permanent deck park. In 1944/45 RN carriers began to carry a permanent deck park of similar size to their USN counterparts, and this increased their aircraft complement from 36 to an eventual 57 aircraft in the single-hangar carriers, and from 48 up to 81 in the double-hangar, 23,400-ton &quot;Implacable&quot; design, compared to 90–110 for the 27,500-ton US &quot;Essex&quot; class.

In the &quot;Illustrious&quot; class, armour was carried at the flight deck level—which became the strength deck—and formed an armoured box-like hangar that was an integral part of the ship&#x27;s structure. However, to make this possible without increasing the displacement it was necessary to reduce the overhead height of the hangars to in the &quot;Illustrious&quot; class hangars and in the upper hangar of the &quot;Indomitable&quot; and in her lower hangar; these compared unfavourably to the of the &quot;Yorktown&quot; class, in &quot;Essex class&quot; and in &quot;Lexington class&quot;. This restricted operations with larger aircraft designs, particularly post-war.

This armour scheme was designed to withstand 6&quot; cruiser shellfire or 500 pound bombs (and heavier bombs dropped from low height or which struck at an angle); in the Home and Mediterranean theatres it was likely that the carriers would operate within the range of shore-based aircraft, which could carry heavier bombs than their carrier-based equivalents. The flight deck had an armoured thickness of 3 inches, closed by 4.5-inch sides and bulkheads. There were 3-inch strakes on either side extending from the box sides to the top edge of the main side belt, which was of 4.5 inches. The main belt protected the machinery, petrol storage, magazines and aerial weapon stores. The lifts were placed outside the hangar, at either end, with access through sliding armoured doors in the end bulkheads.

Later in the war it was found that bombs which penetrated and detonated inside the armoured hangar could cause structural deformation, as the latter was an integral part of the ship&#x27;s structure.

Pre-war doctrine held that the ship&#x27;s own firepower, rather than its aircraft, were to be relied upon for protection, since in the absence of radar, fighters were unlikely to intercept incoming attackers before they could release their weapons. Accordingly, the &quot;Illustrious&quot; class was given an extremely heavy anti-aircraft armament. The armament was similar to &quot;Ark Royal&quot; with twin 4.5 inch turrets (in a new &quot;between-decks&quot; or countersunk design) arranged on the points of a quadrant. The guns were mounted sufficiently high so that they could fire across the decks; de-fuelled aircraft would be stowed in the hangar for protection during aerial attack. The &quot;Illustrious&quot; class were fitted with four HACS controlled High Angle Director Towers, for fire control of her 4.5 inch guns. &quot;Illustrious&quot; pioneered the use of radar to vector carrier-borne fighters onto attacking or shadowing aircraft, and a Fairey Fulmar fighter from &quot;Illustrious&quot; achieved the first radar directed kill on 2 September 1940.

==Ships in class==
===Fate of the class===

All four early ships were hard worked during the Second World War, with &quot;Illustrious&quot; and &quot;Formidable&quot; suffering and surviving heavy damage. Like their contemporary , they fought a long and consuming war, and, despite significant overhauls and repair of battle damage, were worn out by 1946, and were scrapped in the mid-1950s. Due to a variety of factors including Britain&#x27;s dire post-war finances, and the consequent reductions in the size of the Royal Navy post-war modernization was limited to just the last of the class; &quot;Victorious&quot;. Over eight years between 1950 and 1957 she was extensively rebuilt incorporating modern equipment (angled flight deck, steam catapults) to enable her to operate Cold War-era jet aircraft. Although &quot;Victorious&quot; completed a refit in 1967, a minor fire with a manpower shortage and reduction in the naval budgets mean she was not recommissioned but retired in 1968 and sold for scrap. &quot;Indomitable&quot; was given an extensive refit, including new boilers, from 1948 to 1950, then served as flagship of the Home Fleet and also saw service in the Mediterranean. She suffered a hangar deck petrol explosion and fire in early 1953. She was placed in reserve after Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s October 1953 Coronation Review and was then scrapped in 1955.

<doc id="485340" wikidata="Q706147" url="?curid=485340" title="Francis Biddle">
<text>Francis Beverley Biddle (May 9, 1886 – October 4, 1968) was an American lawyer and judge who was the United States Attorney General during World War II. He also served as the primary American judge during Nuremberg trials following World War II and a United States circuit judge of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

==Early life and education==
Biddle was born in Paris, France, while his family was living abroad. He was one of four sons of Frances Brown (née Robinson) and Algernon Sydney Biddle, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School of the Biddle family. He was also a great-great-grandson of Edmund Randolph (1753–1813) the seventh Governor of Virginia, the second United States Secretary of State, and the first United States Attorney General. He graduated from Groton School, where he participated in boxing. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1909 from Harvard College and a Bachelor of Laws in 1911 from Harvard Law School.

==Career==
Biddle first worked as a private secretary to Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. from 1911 to 1912. He spent the next 27 years by practicing law in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1912, he supported the presidential candidacy of former US President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s renegade Bull Moose Party. He was a special assistant to the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania from 1922 to 1926.

During World War I he served as Private in the United States Army from October 23 to November 30, 1918. After he enlisted, he was detailed to the Field Artillery Central Officer&#x27;s training school at Camp Taylor, Kentucky but the war ended during his training and he was discharged.

==Roosevelt administration==
In the 1930s, Biddle was appointed to a number of important governmental roles. In 1934 President Franklin D. Roosevelt nominated him to become Chairman of the National Labor Relations Board. On February 9, 1939, Roosevelt nominated Biddle to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, to a seat vacated by Joseph Buffington. The United States Senate confirmed Biddle on February 28, 1939, and he received his commission on March 4, 1939. He served only one year in the role before resigning on January 22, 1940, to become the United States Solicitor General. This also turned out to be a short-lived position when Roosevelt nominated him to the position of Attorney General of the United States in 1941. During this time he also served as chief counsel to the Special Congressional Committee to Investigate the Tennessee Valley Authority from 1938 to 1939.

===World War II===
During World War II, Biddle used the Espionage Act of 1917 to attempt to shut down &quot;vermin publications&quot;, which included Father Coughlin&#x27;s publication entitled &quot;Social Justice&quot;. Biddle prosecuted several prominent left-wing individuals and organizations under the Smith Act. In 1941, he authorized the prosecution of 29 Socialist Workers Party members in a move that was criticized by the American Civil Liberties Union. Under the act, he also tried unsuccessfully to have trade unionist Harry Bridges deported.

In 1942, Biddle became involved in a case in which a military tribunal appointed by Roosevelt tried eight captured Nazi agents for espionage and for planning sabotage in the United States as part of the German Operation Pastorius. Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Royall challenged Roosevelt&#x27;s decision to prosecute the Germans in military tribunals by citing &quot;Ex parte Milligan&quot; (1866), a case in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the federal government could not establish military tribunals to try civilians in areas that civilian courts were functioning, even during wartime. Biddle responded that the Germans were not entitled to have access to civilian courts because of their status as unlawful combatants. The US Supreme Court upheld that decision in &quot;Ex parte Quirin&quot; (1942) by ruling that the military commission that was set up to try the Germans was lawful. On August 3, 1942, all eight were found guilty and sentenced to death. Five days later, six of the eight were executed in the electric chair on the third floor of the District of Columbia jail. The other two were given prison terms since they had willingly turned their comrades over to the FBI. In 1948, both men were released from prison and returned to Germany.

====Japanese American Internment====
Biddle was one of the few top officials, along with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Secretary of Interior Harold L. Ickes, who opposed the wartime internment of Japanese Americans from the start. 

In 1943, after the internment had already taken place, he asked Roosevelt for the camps to be closed: &quot;The present practice of keeping loyal American citizens in concentration camps for longer than is necessary is dangerous and repugnant to the principles of our government.&quot; Roosevelt resisted, however, and the camps would not be closed for another year. In a postwar memoir, Biddle wrote that &quot;American citizens of Japanese origin were not even handled like aliens of the other enemy nationalities—Germans and Italians—on a selective basis, but as untouchables, a group who could not be trusted and had to be shut up only because they were of Japanese descent.&quot;

===African American civil rights===

Biddle strengthened his department&#x27;s efforts on behalf of African-American civil rights by instructing United States attorneys to direct their prosecutions against forced labor in the South away from the usual practice of charging &quot;peonage&quot;, which required them to find an element of debt, toward bringing charges of &quot;slavery&quot; and &quot;involuntary servitude&quot; against employers and local officials. On February 10, 1942, Biddle ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation to probe into the lynching of Cleo Wright in Sikeston, Missouri, which was the United States&#x27; first federal investigation of a civil rights case.

==Truman administration==

At U.S. President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s request, Biddle resigned after Roosevelt&#x27;s death. Shortly afterward, Truman appointed Biddle as a judge at the Nuremberg trials. Tom C. Clark, Biddle&#x27;s successor, told the story that Biddle was the first government official whose resignation Truman sought and that it was quite a difficult task. Biddle was amused by Truman&#x27;s stammering, but after it was over, he threw his arm around the President and said, &quot;See, Harry, now that wasn&#x27;t so hard.&quot;

In 1947, he was nominated by Truman as the US representative on the United Nations Economic and Social Council. However, after the Republican Party refused to act on the nomination, Biddle asked Truman to withdraw his name.

In 1950, he was named as chairman of the Americans for Democratic Action, a position that he held for three years. One decade later, he wrote two volumes of memoirs: &quot;A Casual Past&quot; in 1961 and &quot;In Brief Authority&quot; in 1962. His final position came as chairman of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial Commission from which he resigned in 1965.

==Personal life==
On April 27, 1918, Biddle was married to the poet Katherine Garrison Chapin. They had two sons:

* Edmund Randolph Biddle (1920–2000), who married Frances M. Disner
* Garrison Chapin Biddle (1923–1930)

Biddle died on October 4, 1968, of a heart attack at his summer home in Wellfleet, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod, at the age of 82. Biddle was interred at the St. Thomas&#x27; Church Cemetery in Whitemarsh Township, Pennsylvania.

==Writing==
Biddle&#x27;s writing skills had long been in evidence prior to the release of his memoirs. In 1927, he wrote a novel about Philadelphia society, &quot;The Llanfear Pattern&quot;. In 1942, he wrote of his close association with Oliver Wendell Holmes 30 years earlier with a biography of the jurist, &quot;Mr. Justice Holmes&quot;, which was adapted into a 1946 Broadway play and a 1950 film entitled &quot;The Magnificent Yankee&quot;. &quot;Democratic Thinking and the War&quot; was published in 1944. His 1949 book, &quot;The World&#x27;s Best Hope&quot;, looked at the role of the United States in the post-war era. He was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963.

==In popular culture==
Biddle was portrayed by Len Cariou in the 2000 miniseries &quot;Nuremberg&quot;. Biddle was also the subject of the 2004 play &quot;Trying&quot; by Joanna McClelland Glass, who had served as Biddle&#x27;s personal secretary from 1967 to 1968.

The ship was transferred to the British Pacific Fleet (BPF) at the end of the year and attacked Japanese-controlled oil refineries in Sumatra in January 1945 before joining the American forces in March as they prepared to invade the island of Okinawa in Operation Iceberg. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and the BPF joined the Americans in attacking the Japanese Home Islands in July and August. Following the end of hostilities she visited ports in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

After returning to the UK in early 1946, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was modified for transport duties, and ferried troops and civilians for the rest of the year before she was reduced to reserve. She was recommissioned in 1950 as a training ship for service with the Home Fleet Training Squadron, participating in exercises and making several port visits overseas. The Board of Admiralty decided that she was redundant in early 1954 and decommissioned her later that year. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was sold for scrap the following year.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Implacable&quot; class were ordered under the 1938 Naval Programme by the Chamberlain government as part of the general rearmament begun in response to the rise of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. The design originated as an improved version of the s and was intended to be faster and carry an additional dozen aircraft over the speed and 36 aircraft of the earlier ships. To remain within the limit allowed by the Second London Naval Treaty, these improvements could only be made by reducing armour protection. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was long overall and at the waterline. Her beam was at the waterline, and she had a draught of at deep load. The &quot;Implacable&quot;-class ships were significantly overweight and displaced at deep load. The ships had metacentric heights of at light load and at deep load as completed. &quot;Indefatigable&quot;″s complement was approximately 2,300 officers and ratings in 1945.

The ships had four Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one shaft, using steam supplied by eight Admiralty 3-drum boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , enough to give the &quot;Indefatigable&quot;-class ships a maximum speed of . On sea trials, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; reached a speed of with . She carried enough fuel oil to give her a range of at .

The armoured flight deck had a maximum width of . A single hydraulic aircraft catapult was fitted on the forward part of the flight deck. The &quot;Implacable&quot;-class carriers were equipped with two lifts on the centreline, the forward of which measured and served only the upper hangar, and the aft lift (), which served both hangars. The upper hangar was long and the lower hangar was long; both had a maximum width of . Each hangar had a height of only 14 feet which precluded storage of Lend-Lease Vought F4U Corsair fighters as well as many post-war aircraft and helicopters. Designed to stow 48 aircraft in their hangars, the use of a permanent deck park allowed the &quot;Implacable&quot; class to accommodate up to 81 aircraft. The additional crewmen, maintenance personnel and facilities needed to support these aircraft were housed in the lower hangar. The ships were provided with of aviation gasoline.

===Armament, electronics and protection===

The ship&#x27;s main armament consisted of sixteen quick-firing (QF)  dual-purpose guns in eight twin-gun turrets, four in sponsons on each side of the hull. Unlike the &quot;Illustrious&quot;-class ships, the roofs of the gun turrets were flat and flush with the flight deck. The gun had a maximum range of . &quot;Indefatigable&quot;″s light anti-aircraft defences included five octuple mounts for QF 2-pounder (&quot;pom-pom&quot;) anti-aircraft (AA) guns, two on the flight deck forward of the island, one on the aft part of the island, and two in sponsons on the port side of the hull. A single quadruple 2-pounder mount was also fitted on the port side of the hull. The 2-pounder gun had a maximum range of .

The ship was also fitted with 55 Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon in 17 single and 19 twin-gun mounts. These guns had a maximum range of , but some were replaced by 40 mm Bofors AA guns when the ships were transferred to the Pacific Theatre as the shell was unlikely to destroy a kamikaze before it hit the ship. The Bofors gun had a maximum range of . By August 1945, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; had 10 single Bofors guns, plus 14 twin and 12 single Oerlikon mounts. By April 1946 these had been reduced to 11 Bofors guns, 6 twin and 7 single Oerlikon guns.

Details of the &quot;Implacable&quot;-class ships&#x27; radar suite are not readily available. They were fitted with the Type 277 surface-search/height-finding radar on top of the bridge and a Type 293 target indicator radar on the foremast. , one of the &quot;Illustrious&quot;-class ships upon which &quot;Indefatigable&quot;″s design was based, also carried Type 279 and Type 281B early-warning radars. Type 282 and Type 285 gunnery radars were mounted on the fire-control directors.

The &quot;Implacable&quot;-class ships had a flight deck protected by of armour. The sides of the hangars were either or . The ends of the hangars were protected by 2-inch bulkheads and the armour of the hangar deck ranged from in thickness. The waterline armour belt was thick, but only covered the central portion of the ship. The belt was closed by 1.5 to 2-inch transverse bulkheads fore and aft. The underwater defence system was a layered system of liquid- and air-filled compartments as used in the &quot;Illustrious&quot; class. The magazines for the 4.5-inch guns lay outside the armoured citadel and were protected by 2 to 3-inch roofs, 4.5-inch sides and 1.5 to 2-inch ends.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Indefatigable&quot; was laid down by John Brown &amp; Co. at their shipyard in Clydebank on 3 November 1939 as Yard Number 565. She was launched on 8 December 1942 by Victoria of Hesse, Dowager Marchioness of Milford Haven. Captain Quintin Graham was appointed to command the ship in August 1943. While fitting out, in order to confound the enemy, a ruse known as Operation Bijou, initiated by London Controlling Section, was launched whereby it was made known that &quot;Indefatigable&quot; had already entered service. Ultra decrypts revealed that the Japanese believed the deception, with operatives including Malcolm Muggeridge and Peter Fleming supplying disinformation for more than a year, sufficient to make the enemy believe the vessel had gone to the Far East and returned to the Clyde for a refit, by which time she was actually finished.

The ship was commissioned on 8 December 1943 and began sea trials, which revealed many problems that required rectification and delayed her formal completion until 3 May 1944. While &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was still conducting builder&#x27;s trials, a de Havilland Mosquito landed aboard on 25 March, piloted by Lieutenant Eric Brown (this is often cited as the first landing by a twin-engined aeroplane on an aircraft carrier, but in fact a Potez 565 had landed on and taken off from the French carrier &quot;Béarn&quot; in 1936). The ship was assigned to the Home Fleet and was working up over the next several months while the Fairey Fireflies of 1770 Squadron flew aboard on 18 May. The squadron was followed by the Fairey Barracuda torpedo bombers of 826 Squadron in June.

===Norwegian operations===
&quot;Indefatigable&quot;″s first mission was a brief sortie on 1 July 1944 to provide air cover for the ocean liner that was ferrying American troops to Britain. Upon her return, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; embarked the Supermarine Seafire fighters of 887 Squadron and the Barracudas of 820 Squadron, completing No. 9 Naval Torpedo-Bomber Reconnaissance Wing, over the next week. Her first combat mission was an attack on the battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot; in Kaafjord on 17 July with two other Home Fleet carriers (Operation Mascot). She contributed 23 Barracudas and 12 Fireflies to the mission; the former attacked the battleship while the Fireflies strafed the flak positions defending her. A smoke screen prevented most of the Barracudas from seeing their target and they failed to hit &quot;Tirpitz&quot;. One Barracuda was forced to ditch near the carrier and its crew was rescued by the destroyer .

894 Squadron, equipped with Seafires, landed aboard after the attack on 24 July to complete No. 24 Naval Fighter Wing. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and several escort carriers attacked targets in Norway on 10 August, destroying 6 Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighters and sinking a minesweeper. For Operation Goodwood, a series of attacks on &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, the Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters of 1840 Squadron replaced the Barracudas of 826 Squadron. The first mission took place on the morning of 22 August when &quot;Indefatigable&quot; launched 12 Barracudas, 11 Fireflies, 8 Hellcats, and 8 Seafires against the German battleship and nearby targets. A smoke screen again protected &quot;Tirpitz&quot; and no damage was inflicted; two Seafires failed to return. Another attack was made later in the day without effect. A further attack could not be mounted until 24 August because of bad weather; for this mission the carrier contributed 12 Barracudas, 11 Fireflies and 4 Seafires, all of which returned. &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was lightly damaged by two hits during this attack, one a bomb and the other a armour-piercing bomb. The latter penetrated the armoured deck but failed to explode and would probably have inflicted serious damage, possibly even sinking the ship, had it done so. A final attack was made five days later, again without effect. 887 Squadron sank seven seaplanes at their at Banak during the operation.

===Indian Ocean and Pacific operations===

On 19 September 1944, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; sortied from Scapa Flow to attack targets near Tromsø, but the operation was cancelled because of bad weather. The ship underwent a brief refit at her builder&#x27;s yard between 28 September and 8 November. She became the flagship of the 1st Aircraft Carrier Squadron (1st ACS) when Rear Admiral Sir Philip Vian hoisted his flag on 15 November. The following day, King George VI inspected the ship; the ground crews later embarked for 820, 887, 894 and 1770 Squadrons. Their aircraft, 40 Seafires, 12 Fireflies, and 21 Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers, followed on 19 November, and she sailed for the Far East to join the British Pacific Fleet. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; arrived at Colombo, Ceylon, on 10 December and Vian transferred his flag to .

Together with &quot;Victorious&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot;, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; attacked an oil refinery at Pangkalan Brandan, Sumatra on 4 January 1945 (Operation Lentil). She embarked six photoreconnaissance Hellcats of 888 Squadron for the attack; her only contribution to the attack itself was the Fireflies of 1770 Squadron, which used RP-3 rocket projectiles on their targets. The squadron claimed to have shot down a Nakajima Ki-43 &quot;Oscar&quot;, for the loss of a Firefly that ran out of fuel and had to ditch next to the ship. After &quot;Indefatigable&quot;″s return, Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia Command, addressed the crew on 11 January.

En route to Sydney to prepare for operations in the Pacific, the BPF&#x27;s carriers attacked oil refineries near Palembang, Sumatra, on 24 and 29 January (Operation Meridian). The ship&#x27;s Seafires lacked the range to reach the targets so they were retained on combat air patrols (CAP) over the fleet for both attacks. She contributed 10 of her Avengers and all of her Fireflies to the first attack, which destroyed most of the oil storage tanks and cut the refinery&#x27;s output by half for three months. Five days later, the BPF attacked a different refinery and 820 Squadron again contributed 10 Avengers to the attack while 1770 Squadron added nine Fireflies. The latter squadron also flew two Fireflies on an armed reconnaissance mission over an airfield that lay between the carriers and their target. The attack was very successful at heavy cost, but the losses of &quot;Indefatigable&quot;″s squadrons are not available. Her Seafires shot down a Mitsubishi Ki-46 &quot;Dinah&quot; reconnaissance aircraft searching for the fleet and 5 Kawasaki Ki-48 &quot;Lily&quot; bombers that attacked at low level.

The BPF arrived in Sydney on 10 February; the crews received leave and the ships got some maintenance before they sailed for the BPF&#x27;s advance base at Manus Island, in the Admiralty Islands, on 27 February. They arrived on 7 March and exercised together before sailing for Ulithi on 18 March. The BPF joined the American Fifth Fleet there two days later to participate in the preliminary operations for the invasion of Okinawa. The British role during the operation was to neutralise airfields on the Sakishima Islands, between Okinawa and Formosa, beginning on 26 March. Her Seafires were again retained to defend the fleet and only her Avengers and Fireflies attacked the airfields. Her Seafire squadrons lacked 13 of their authorised strength of 50 pilots and could not sustain the pace of the first day of operations, when they flew 72 sorties. After a break at the end of the month to refuel, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; became the first British carrier to be hit by a kamikaze the day after flying operations resumed, when one of the Japanese planes evaded the CAP and struck the base of the carrier&#x27;s island on 1 April. The bomb it carried did not detonate and this limited casualties to 21 men killed and 27 wounded. Damage to the ship was minimal and the flight deck was back in operation thirty minutes later.

On 12 and 13 April, the BPF switched targets to airfields in northern Formosa. On the first day, a pair of Fireflies encountered five Mitsubishi Ki-51 &quot;Sonia&quot; dive bombers and shot down four of them. A flight of four Seafires on CAP spotted four Japanese fighters, three Mitsubishi A6M Zeroes and a Kawasaki Ki-61 &quot;Tony&quot; later that morning, and shot down one Zero. The BPF returned to the Sakishima Islands on 17 April before retiring to Leyte Gulf to rest and resupply. Wastage of Seafires to all causes was very heavy during the operation with 25 out of 40 lost or damaged beyond repair and only 5 replacements received. Their short range and lack of endurance was considered by Vian to be a severe handicap for the BPF, which returned to action on 4 May and again attacked targets in the Sakishima Islands. Its aircraft continued to do so until they flew their last missions of Operation Iceberg on 25 May. Statistics compiled by the BPF staff showed that 61 Seafires were lost or damaged beyond repair during both phases of the operation due to deck-landing accidents.
The BPF arrived back at Sydney on 5 June and sailed for Manus three weeks later. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was forced to remain behind as she required repairs to her machinery. Her air group flew aboard on 7 July (1772 Squadron and its Fireflies replacing 1770 Squadron) when she sailed for Manus. She reached the coast of Japan on 20 July and her aircraft began attacking targets near Osaka and in the Inland Sea four days later. Her Seafire squadrons had adapted larger external fuel tanks for their aircraft and they were no longer limited to CAP duty. The BPF&#x27;s aircraft crippled the escort carrier and sank numerous smaller ships on 24 July. After replenishing, airstrikes resumed on 28 and 30 July, the British sinking the escort near Maizuru. A combination of bad weather, refuelling requirements and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima delayed the resumption of air operations until 9 August. During the day, &quot;Indefatigable&quot;″s aircraft attacked targets in northern Honshu and southern Hokkaido. The attacks were repeated the next day, sinking two warships and numerous small merchantmen and destroying numerous railroad locomotives and parked aircraft.

The BPF had been scheduled to withdraw after 10 August to prepare for Operation Olympic, the invasion of Kyushu scheduled for November, and the bulk of the force departed for Manus on 12 August. &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, however, had been chosen to remain as part of the Allied occupation force. The next day her aircraft attacked targets in the vicinity of Tokyo. Flight operations resumed on the morning of the 15th after an operational pause to refuel. The first airstrike was tasked to attack Kisarazu Air Field with four Fireflies and six Avengers, escorted by eight Seafires, but was forced to divert to its secondary target because of bad weather. En route they were attacked by a dozen Zeros in the last British air combat of the war. The Japanese fighters shot down one Seafire on their first pass and crippled an Avenger. The Seafires claimed four Zeros shot down, four others probably shot down, and another four damaged. An Avenger also claimed one Zero as damaged. A Yokosuka D4Y &quot;Judy&quot; dive bomber attacked the carrier after the ceasefire went into effect, but its two bombs missed. After the ceasefire, &quot;Indefatigable&quot;″s aircraft continued to fly CAP and flew reconnaissance missions looking for Allied prisoners of war, dropping supplies to them as they were located.

===Post-war service===

On 17 August 1945, Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser, commander of the BPF, came aboard and addressed the crew. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; continued flying operations until she entered Sagami Bay on 5 September. She departed three days later for Manus en route to Sydney. The ship arrived at Sydney on 18 September and began a leisurely refit that lasted until 15 November. On 1 November, Captain Ian MacIntyre relieved Graham as captain of the ship. She became Vian&#x27;s flagship on 22 November and sailed to New Zealand to show the flag. She arrived in Wellington on 27 November and was opened for public tours, during which time the Prime Minister, Peter Fraser, also visited. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; then sailed to Auckland, arriving on 12 December, and was again opened for tours. She returned to Sydney for the holidays and visited Melbourne on 22 January 1946 before departing for home nine days later. Vian transferred his flag to her sister ship &quot;Implacable&quot; that day and the ship stopped off at Fremantle and Cape Town en route. While &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was visiting the latter city, she was opened to the public, and the Governor-General of South Africa toured the ship.
The carrier arrived at Portsmouth Dockyard on 16 March 1946. Her hangars were modified to accommodate over 1,900 passengers, including women, and she departed for Australia on 25 April carrying 782 RN personnel and 130 Australian war brides. Most of the RN personnel disembarked at Colombo and most of the war brides did the same at Fremantle. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; continued on to Sydney, where she embarked a complete naval hospital, with patients, and over 1,000 RN officers and ratings. She departed on 9 June and arrived at Plymouth on 7 July. Her next voyage involved transporting a much smaller number of men to Malta and Colombo; only 47 officers and 67 ratings, most of whom left the ship at Malta. When she arrived at Colombo on 15 August, she loaded a full complement of passengers from all three services to return to the UK. The ship arrived at Portsmouth on 9 September and her next voyage involved over 1,200 RN personnel and civilians ferried to Malta, Colombo, and Singapore where almost 1,300 personnel embarked. She returned to Portsmouth on 29 October and began a brief refit in preparation for her final trooping voyage. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; sailed empty for Norfolk, Virginia, where she loaded RN personnel before returning to Portsmouth on 21 November. The next month, she was placed in reserve and Captain MacIntyre retired on 7 January 1947.

The Admiralty decided to recommission &quot;Indefatigable&quot; for use as a training ship in mid-1949. Captain Henry Fancourt assumed command on 22 August to prepare for sea. The ship arrived at Devonport to begin the necessary modifications on 30 August and the following day Fancourt turned over command to the dockyard. Captain John Grindle was appointed to command on 24 March 1950 and the ship was recommissioned on 28 May. Two days later Captain Robert Sherbrooke, VC, relieved Grindle and &quot;Indefatigable&quot; began her sea trials on 28 June. She was inspected by Rear Admiral St John Micklethwaithe, Flag Officer Training Squadron, on 3 July and received her first trainees shortly afterwards. She participated in exercises with the Home Fleet and joined it in Gibraltar in September and October. On 12 March 1951 she sortied from Portland, flying Micklethwaite&#x27;s flag, to exercise with the Home Fleet before beginning a brief refit at Devonport in May. Captain John Grant relieved Sherbrooke on 6 June and the ship was opened to visitors as part of the Festival of Britain on 17 July. Five days later the visitors were stranded aboard ship overnight when a storm came up and forced &quot;Indefatigable&quot; to put to sea. The seas moderated the next day and the visitors departed in safety. Rear Admiral Royer Dick hoisted his flag aboard the carrier in September until she began a short refit at Devonport in January 1952.

&quot;Indefatigable&quot; joined &quot;Implacable&quot; for her annual winter visit to Gibraltar after completing her refit in February 1952. Over the summer she exercised with the Home Fleet and visited the Danish port of Aarhus, where she was visited by Queen Alexandrine of Denmark in July. Captain Ralph Fisher assumed command on 30 January 1953 and took her to sea three weeks later for exercises with the Home Fleet and her annual visit to Gibraltar. She returned to Portland in late March and visited Bournemouth at the end of May. She joined her sister and several other carriers on 9 June to sail for Spithead for the Coronation Fleet Review of Queen Elizabeth II on 15 June as one of a fleet of nine carriers. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; joined her sister for fleet exercises off the Scilly Isles and in the Bristol Channel in September and October before beginning her annual refit on 6 October. The Admiralty announced on 26 January 1954 that both ships would be replaced as training ships and reduced to reserve. This had no short-term impact on their activities as they sailed for the Western Mediterranean on their annual winter cruise. The ship exercised with the Home Fleet and made a port visit to Casablanca, Morocco, before visiting Gibraltar. Captain Hugh Browne assumed command on 10 May after Fisher had been promoted. The ship welcomed home Queen Elizabeth II and her husband four days later as they returned from their tour of the Commonwealth. The following month, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; exercised with the Home Fleet in Scottish waters and visited Aarhus again. In August she began transferring her training duties to the carrier and arrived at Rosyth on 2 September to be paid off, a process that took until the following month to complete. She was towed to Gareloch in June 1955 where she was listed for disposal. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was sold for scrap in September 1956 and subsequently broken up at Faslane.

<text>The London Docks were one of several sets of docks in the historic Port of London.

They were constructed in Wapping, downstream from the City of London between 1799 and 1815, at a cost exceeding £5½ million.

Traditionally ships had docked at wharves on the River Thames, but by the late 1700s more capacity was needed. They were the closest docks to the City of London until St Katharine Docks were built two decades later.

==London Dock Company==
The London Dock Company was formed in 1800, and work on the docks began in 1801. In 1864 they were amalgamated with St Katharine Docks.

== Physical description ==
The London Docks occupied a total area of about 30 acres (120,000 m2), consisting of Western and Eastern docks linked by the short Tobacco Dock. The Western Dock was connected to the Thames by Hermitage Basin to the south west and Wapping Basin to the south.

The Eastern Dock connected to the Thames via the Shadwell Basin to the east. The principal designers were the architects and engineers Daniel Asher Alexander and John Rennie.

The docks specialised in high-value luxury commodities such as ivory, spices, coffee and cocoa as well as wine and wool, for which elegant warehouses and wine cellars were constructed. The system was never connected to the railway network. The Port of London Authority took over the London Docks together with the rest of the enclosed docks in 1909.

== After containerisation of commercial shipping ==
The docks were closed to shipping in 1969 and sold to the borough of Tower Hamlets. The western portion of the London Docks was filled in with the (unrealised) intention of turning them into public housing estates. The land was still largely derelict when it was acquired in 1981 by the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC). It was subsequently redeveloped with over 1,000 individual properties centred on the old Tobacco Dock and Shadwell Basin.

The controversial &quot;Fortress Wapping&quot; printing works of Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News International corporation was constructed on the northern half of the infilled Western Dock. Hermitage Basin and Shadwell Basin survive. Wapping Basin is now a sports pitch and some of the Eastern Dock site is open space. A small canal runs across the southern part of the Western Dock site from Hermitage Basin to Tobacco Dock.

<doc id="485348" wikidata="Q2786571" url="?curid=485348" title="Alan Ralsky">
<text>Alan Ralsky ( 1945–2021) was a convicted American fraudster, best known for his activities as a spammer.

==Spamming==
Ralsky was one of the most prolific sources of junk e-mail worldwide. Unlike most spammers, he provided interviews to various newspapers, although he claimed to be a commercial e-mailer rather than a spammer. He claimed that he was a legitimate business that complied with all laws, but was convicted of spamming and other fraudulent activities in June 2009.

Ralsky apparently began his spamming career in 1996, when his licenses to sell insurance were revoked in Michigan and Illinois.

He gained much of his notoriety following a December 2002 interview with &quot;The Detroit News&quot;. The article was posted to Slashdot and the address of his newly built home was posted to Slashdot not long after that. Hundreds of Slashdot readers then searched the Internet for advertising mailing lists and free catalogs and signed him up for them. As a result, he was flooded with junk mail. In a &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; article on December 6, 2002, he is quoted as saying, &quot;They&#x27;ve signed me up for every advertising campaign and mailing list there is. These people are out of their minds. They&#x27;re harassing me.&quot;

==Legal timeline==
* In 1992 he served a fifty-day sentence for selling unregistered securities.
* On August 7, 1995, he pleaded guilty to federal bank fraud in Ohio. He served three years probation for a felony charge of falsifying banking records.
* On March 14, 1999, he pleaded guilty to misprision of felony in Michigan.
* In early October, 2005, a warrant was unsealed, showing the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) raided Alan Ralsky&#x27;s home in September. In the raid, the FBI took computers, financial records, and even the &quot;Detroit News&quot; article cited above. They then raided his son-in-law&#x27;s home. Ralsky&#x27;s business was not legally shut down, but he was unable to operate following the raid.

<text>The &quot;Implacable&quot;-class aircraft carrier consisted of two aircraft carriers built for the Royal Navy during World War II. Derived from the design of the , they were faster and carried more aircraft than the older ships. They were initially assigned to the Home Fleet when completed in 1944 and attacked targets in Norway as well as the . Subsequently, they were assigned to the British Pacific Fleet (BPF).

 was the first ship to go to the Pacific and attacked Japanese-controlled oil refineries in Sumatra en route. She participated in Operation Iceberg, the invasion of Okinawa in March–April 1945. ″s arrival in the Pacific was delayed by a refit and she did not begin operations against the Japanese until June. The sister ships participated in the attacks on the Japanese Home Islands in July and August. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was the only carrier chosen to continue operations after most of the BPF withdrew to prepare for further operations in early August. After the Japanese formal surrender in September, &quot;Implacable&quot; ferried Allied troops and prisoners of war back to Australia and Canada for the rest of the year.

The sisters returned home in 1946; &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was used for the rest of the year to transport troops before being placed in reserve in 1947 and &quot;Implacable&quot; became the training carrier for Home Fleet. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was converted into a training ship and reactivated in 1950 for service with the Home Fleet. &quot;Implacable&quot; was relegated to the reserve that same year and modified into a training ship in 1952. The sisters were scheduled for modernisation during the mid-1950s, but it was cancelled as the modernisation of the carrier in the queue ahead of them proved to be too expensive and lengthy. The sisters were decommissioned in 1954 and sold for scrap in 1955–1956.

== Background and description ==
The &quot;Implacable&quot; class had its origin as an improved version of the &quot;Illustrious&quot;-class aircraft carriers for the 1938 Naval Programme while still remaining within the available from the tonnage allowed by the Second London Naval Treaty. The initial change was to increase the carriers&#x27; speed to no less than which required the addition of a fourth steam turbine and associated propeller shaft. Offsetting the additional weight of the machinery meant reductions in armour thicknesses in the hangar deck and the bulkheads at the ends of the hangar. At the same time the Director of Naval Construction (DNC) was developing a different modified &quot;Illustrious&quot; design (Design D) to carry an additional dozen aircraft (a total of 48) in a lower hangar that also incorporated the additional machinery of the initial design with the sacrifice of even more armour. Hangar height was initially planned as in the upper hangar to accommodate the new Fairey Albacore torpedo bomber and in the lower hangar to accommodate taller amphibious aircraft, but a later change in policy raised the upper hangar height to . Design D was submitted to the Board of Admiralty on 2 August 1938 and approved on 17 November. In April 1939 the lower hangar&#x27;s height was reduced to 14 feet to compensate for the thickening of the hangar side armour to and the idea of carrying amphibians in the hangar was abandoned.

The &quot;Implacable&quot;-class ships were long overall and at the waterline. Their beam was at the waterline and they had a draught of at deep load. The ships were significantly overweight and displaced at deep load. Their complement was approximately 2,300 officers and enlisted men in 1945. They had metacentric heights of at light load and at deep load as completed.

The ships were fitted with four Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one shaft using steam supplied by eight Admiralty 3-drum boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , enough to give them a maximum speed of . On their sea trials, the ships reached speeds of with . The &quot;Implacable&quot; class carried a maximum of of fuel oil which gave them a range of at .

The armoured flight deck had a maximum width of . The arrestor cables, crash barricades, aircraft catapult and lifts were designed to handle aircraft up to in weight. The carriers were fitted with nine arrestor cables aft that were designed to stop landing, at speeds of up to . They were backed up by three crash barricades to prevent landing aircraft from crashing into aircraft parked on the ship&#x27;s bow. In case of damage to the rear flight deck, the &quot;Implacable&quot;-class ships also mounted three additional forward arrestor cables to permit aircraft to land over the bow. A single BH3 hydraulic catapult was fitted on the forward part of the flight deck to launch 20,000-pound aircraft at ; lighter aircraft could be launched at a maximum speed of . The ships were equipped with two lifts on the centreline, the forward of which measured and served only the upper hangar, and the aft lift () which served both hangars. The upper hangar was long and the lower hangar was long; both had a uniform width of . Both hangars had a height of only 14 feet which precluded storage of Lend-Lease Vought F4U Corsair fighters as well as many post-war aircraft and helicopters. In case of fire the upper hangar could be divided by two fire curtains and the lower hangar had one fire curtain. Designed to stow 48 aircraft in their hangars, the use of a permanent deck park allowed the &quot;Implacable&quot; class to accommodate up to 81 aircraft. The crewmen, maintenance personnel and facilities needed to support these additional aircraft were housed in the lower hangar. The ships were provided with of petrol, only enough for approximately five sorties per aircraft.

===Armament, electronics, and armour===
The ships&#x27; main armament consisted of sixteen QF Mark II dual-purpose guns in eight powered RP 10 Mk II** twin-gun turrets, four in sponsons on each side of the hull. Unlike the &quot;Illustrious&quot;-class ships, the roofs of the gun turrets were flat and flush with the flight deck. The gun had a maximum range of at an elevation of +45° and a ceiling of . Their light anti-aircraft defences included five octuple mounts for QF 2-pounder (&quot;pom-pom&quot;) anti-aircraft guns, two on the flight deck forward of the island, one on the aft part of the island and two in sponsons on the port side of the hull. A single quadruple 2-pounder mount was also fitted on the port side of the hull. The 2-pounder gun had a maximum range of . The two ships were also fitted with approximately sixty Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon in varying numbers of single and twin-gun mounts. These guns had a maximum range of , but many were replaced by 40 mm Bofors AA guns when the ships were transferred to the Pacific War as the 20 mm shell was unlikely to destroy a kamikaze before it hit the ship. The Bofors gun had a maximum range of . Two additional quadruple &quot;pom-pom&quot; mounts were added to &quot;Implacable&quot; before she joined the British Pacific Fleet in 1945. After the war, more Oerlikons were exchanged for Bofors guns. By April 1946, the sisters had 11–12 Bofors guns and 19–30 Oerlikons each.

The 4.5-inch guns were controlled by four Mk V* (M) fire-control directors, each mounting a Type 285 gunnery radar. Two of the directors were positioned on the flight deck, one each fore and aft of the island, a third was on the island, aft of the funnel, and the fourth director was on the port side of the hull, below the flight deck. Each director sent its data to a Fuze Keeping Clock AA fire-control system for gunnery calculations. Each &quot;pom-pom&quot; was provided with its own Mk IV director that carried a range-only Type 282 gunnery radar.

The specifics of the &quot;Implacable&quot;-class ships&#x27; radar suite is not readily available in published sources. They were fitted with the Type 277 surface-search/height-finding radar on top of the bridge and a Type 293 target indicator radar on the foremast. The ships probably carried Type 279 and Type 281B early-warning radars, based on the radars fitted aboard the &quot;Illustrious&quot;-class carrier late in the war.

The &quot;Implacable&quot;-class ships had a flight deck protected by of armour. The sides of the hangars were designed to be thick to protect the hangar from low-level attacks with semi-armour-piercing bombs, but were supposedly thickened to late in the design process at the cost of reducing the height of the lower hangar. Naval historian Norman Friedman wrote: &quot;Ironically, it appears that the ships were actually built with 1.5-inch ... armour.&quot; The ends of the hangars were protected by 2-inch bulkheads and the armour of the hangar deck ranged from in thickness.

The waterline armour belt was thick, but only covered the central portion of the ship to form the armoured citadel. The belt was closed by 1.5 to 2-inch transverse bulkheads fore and aft. The underwater defence system was a layered system of liquid- and air-filled compartments as used in the &quot;Illustrious&quot; class and was estimated to be able to resist a explosive charge. The magazines for the 4.5-inch guns lay outside the armoured citadel and were protected by 2 to 3-inch thick roofs, 4.5-inch sides and 1.5 to 2-inch ends.

===Planned modernisation===
The two &quot;Implacable&quot;s were tentatively scheduled to be modernised in 1953–55 with &quot;Implacable&quot; following &quot;Victorious&quot;. The draft Staff Requirements were drawn up in July 1951. This included combining the two hangars into a single hangar, strengthening the flight deck and aircraft handling equipment to deal with aircraft, enlarging the lifts to , adding a gallery deck between the hangar and the flight deck to accommodate the additional personnel required, the addition of steam catapults, and the increase of her aviation fuel stowage to . Other desired improvements were new boilers to increase her endurance, more space for the latest radars, and the replacement of her anti-aircraft armament with the British version of the 3&quot;/70 Mark 26 gun and sextuple mounts for the Bofors guns.

By October 1951, the estimated completion date for &quot;Victorious&quot;″s modernisation was already a year past the initial estimate of April 1954. &quot;Implacable&quot; was scheduled to begin her modernisation in April 1953 for completion in 1956, but the Director of Dockyards pointed out that existing schedules prevented her from beginning any earlier than April 1955 unless the modernisations of two cruisers and the guided missile test ship RFA &quot;Girdle Ness&quot; were delayed. The Controller of the Navy asked if the time and cost of the reconstruction could be reduced, but the minimum modifications were the most expensive as they involved structural alterations. The Controller ordered the Director of Dockyards to plan for rebuilding &quot;Implacable&quot; between June 1953 and December 1956 even after the latter protested that even a limited modernisation would require about three-quarters of the structural work of the original plan and that the shortage of skilled workers (already insufficient for &quot;Victorious&quot; by herself) would delay work on both ships. In order to reduce the amount of structural work, the requirement to replace the boilers was cancelled and the ship would receive existing radars instead of systems then still under development. In January 1952, the ship&#x27;s new armament was finalized at six twin-gun 3&quot;/70 mounts and three sextuple Bofors mounts. Five months later the Admiralty decided that &quot;Victorious&quot; would be the last fleet carrier modernised as experience showed that the process would take longer and cost more than was practicable.

==Ships==
==Construction and service ==

Two ships were originally planned, but only one carrier was included in the 1938 Naval Programme as the other was delayed a year by the government. While under construction, the ships had their forward lift enlarged to take non-folding aircraft like the Hawker Sea Hurricane and the early models of the Supermarine Seafire, the flight deck was widened abreast the forward lift, splinter protection was added as were seven diesel generators, each in their own watertight compartment. All these changes increased the ships&#x27; displacement by at deep load.

&quot;Implacable&quot;″s construction was suspended in 1940 in favour of escorts needed in the Battle of the Atlantic so that the two carriers were launched within days of each other. She embarked portions of her air wing for training in late August and was assigned to the Home Fleet on 7 October at Scapa Flow after working up. She joined ships searching for &quot;Tirpitz&quot; a week later and some of her Fairey Fireflies spotted the battleship off Håkøya Island near Tromsø. Subsequently, her Fireflies successfully attacked targets in Norway. In late October, the carrier&#x27;s Seafires arrived and she participated in Operation Athletic off the Norwegian coast, sinking four warships and two merchant ships and damaging a German submarine. In November and December, &quot;Implacable&quot; provided air cover for minelaying operations and attacked German shipping off the Norwegian coast. On 15 December she began a refit at Rosyth preparatory to her transfer to the BPF, which included augmenting her light AA armament.

When the refit was completed on 10 March 1945, the ship embarked an enlarged air wing with 81 aircraft (48 Seafires, 12 Fireflies, and 21 Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers), the largest number of aircraft aboard a British carrier up to that time. &quot;Implacable&quot; arrived at Sydney, Australia, in May and joined the other carriers of the 1st Aircraft Carrier Squadron (1st ACS) at Manus Island after their return from the invasion of Okinawa in June. On 14–15 June, the carrier attacked the Japanese naval base at Truk. After working up with the other carriers, the ship sailed with the 1st ACS on 6 July to rendezvous with the American carriers of Task Force 38 off the Japanese home island of Honshu ten days later. The British carriers began flying sorties against Japanese targets on Honshu on 17 July and &quot;Implacable&quot;″s aircraft, before departing the area on 11 August to replenish, flew over 1,000 sorties. She arrived at Sydney on 24 August and spent most of the rest of the year ferrying Allied prisoners of war and soldiers back to Australia and Canada. In January 1946, together with her sister &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and several other ships, she made a number of port visits in Australia and New Zealand. The ship was refitted in Sydney in preparation for her return home on 3 June where she became the deck-landing training carrier for the Home Fleet.

&quot;Implacable&quot; temporarily became a trials carrier in October 1947 as her own air group was not yet ready and she was refitted from October to December 1948 in preparation of service as the Home Fleet flagship. She embarked a squadron each of de Havilland Sea Hornets and Blackburn Firebrands in April 1949 and became the flagship of Admiral Sir Philip Vian on 29 April. A squadron of de Havilland Sea Vampires flew from her deck later that year and her air group was augmented by a squadron of Fairey Barracudas in 1950. &quot;Implacable&quot; was placed in reserve in September 1950 and slowly converted into a training ship by the addition of extra accommodation and classrooms, including the addition of a deckhouse on her flight deck. She was recommissioned in January 1952 as the flagship of the Home Fleet Training Squadron. Together with &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, she was present during the Coronation Fleet Review of Queen Elizabeth II on 15 June 1953. Four months later, &quot;Implacable&quot; ferried a battalion of troops from Plymouth to Trinidad in response to a crisis in British Guiana. She was decommissioned on 1 September 1954 and sold for breaking up on 27 October 1955.
While &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was still conducting builder&#x27;s trials, a de Havilland Mosquito landed aboard on 25 March 1944, piloted by Lieutenant Eric Brown. This was the first landing by a twin-engined aeroplane on a carrier. After working up the ship was assigned to the Home Fleet in early July 1944 with an air group of Seafires, Fireflies and Barracudas. On 17 July, she participated in Operation Mascot, an attack on &quot;Tirpitz&quot; that was foiled by German smoke screens. The following month, &quot;Indefatigable&quot;″s aircraft provided air cover to minelaying operations and attacked targets in Norway. She was also assigned to a series of attacks on &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, Operation Goodwood, in late August which failed to significantly damage the battleship.

&quot;Indefatigable&quot; was assigned to the BPF in November and she arrived in Colombo, Ceylon, on 10 December where she joined the 1st ACS. Together with the other carriers of the BPF, she attacked oil refineries in Sumatra in January 1945 (Operation Lentil and Operation Meridian) before sailing to Sydney to prepare for operations in the Pacific. The BPF joined the American Fifth Fleet at Ulithi on 20 March and attacked airfields on the Sakishima Islands, south of Okinawa, beginning on 26 March, as part of the preparations for Operation Iceberg. During these operations, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; became the first British carrier to be hit by a kamikaze when one penetrated the combat air patrol (CAP) and struck the base of her island on 1 April. The bomb carried by the kamikaze did not detonate and this limited casualties to 21 men killed and 27 wounded. Damage to the ship was minimal and the flight deck was back in operation thirty minutes later. After Okinawa had been secured, the BPF arrived back at Sydney on 7 June and &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was delayed rejoining operations as she required repairs to her machinery. She departed Manus on 12 July and reached the coast of Japan eight days later. Her aircraft began attacking targets in the Inland Sea on 24 July. Most of the BPF withdrew as planned on 10 August to prepare for Operation Olympic, the invasion of Kyushu scheduled for November, but &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and several other ships remained to represent Britain at the end of operations. The ship&#x27;s aircraft flew missions on 13 and 15 August; during the last of these missions, her Seafires shot down eight of twelve Mitsubishi A6M Zeros while losing one of their own and an Avenger gunner shot down another Japanese aircraft. After the ceasefire, her aircraft continued to fly CAP and flew reconnaissance missions looking for Allied prisoners of war.

&quot;Indefatigable&quot; arrived at Sydney on 18 September and began a leisurely refit that lasted until 15 November. After touring Australia and New Zealand, she arrived at Spithead on 15 March 1946 where she was modified to accommodate over 1,900 passengers. She ferried troops to and from Australia, Ceylon, Singapore and America for the rest of the year before being placed in reserve at the beginning of 1947. The ship was modified for use as a training ship and recommissioned in 1950 for service with the Home Fleet Training Squadron. She was decommissioned at Rosyth in October 1954 and towed to Gareloch in June 1955 where she was listed for disposal. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was sold for scrap in September 1956 and subsequently broken up.

<text>HMS &quot;Implacable&quot; was the name ship of her class of two aircraft carriers built for the Royal Navy during World War II. Upon completion in 1944, she was initially assigned to the Home Fleet and attacked targets in Norway for the rest of the year. She was subsequently assigned to the British Pacific Fleet (BPF) where she attacked the Japanese naval base at Truk and targets in the Japanese Home Islands in 1945. The ship was used to repatriate liberated Allied prisoners of war (PoWs) and soldiers after the Japanese surrender, for the rest of the year. &quot;Implacable&quot; returned home in 1946 and became the Home Fleet&#x27;s deck-landing training carrier, a role that lasted until 1950. She briefly served as flagship of the Home Fleet in 1950. During this time she participated in many exercises and made a number of port visits in Western Europe. She was placed in reserve in 1950 and converted into a training ship in 1952, and served as flagship of the Home Fleet Training Squadron. The ship was considered for a major modernisation in 1951–1952, but this was rejected as too expensive and time-consuming. &quot;Implacable&quot; was decommissioned in 1954 and sold for scrap the following year.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Implacable&quot; class had its origin as an improved version of the &quot;Illustrious&quot;-class aircraft carriers for the 1938 Naval Programme. They were designed to be faster, and to carry an additional dozen aircraft at the expense of reduced armour protection to remain within the available from the tonnage allowed by the Washington Naval Treaty. &quot;Implacable&quot; was long overall and at the waterline. Her beam was at the waterline and she had a draught of at deep load. The &quot;Implacable&quot;-class ships were significantly overweight and displaced at deep load. The ships had metacentric heights of at light load and at deep load as completed. &quot;Implacable&quot;″s complement was approximately 2,300 officers and ratings in 1945.

The ships were equipped with four Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one shaft using steam supplied by eight Admiralty 3-drum boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , enough to give them a maximum speed of . On sea trials, &quot;Implacable&quot; reached speeds of with . She carried a maximum of of fuel oil which gave her a range of at .

The armoured flight deck had a maximum width of . A single hydraulic aircraft catapult was fitted on the forward part of the flight deck. The &quot;Implacable&quot;-class carriers were equipped with two lifts on the centreline, the forward of which measured and served only the upper hangar, and the aft lift () which served both hangars. The upper hangar was long and the lower hangar was long; both had a maximum width of . Both hangars had a height of only 14 feet which precluded storage of Lend-Lease Vought F4U Corsair fighters as well as many post-war aircraft and helicopters. Designed to stow 48 aircraft in their hangars, the use of a permanent deck park allowed the &quot;Implacable&quot; class to accommodate up to 81 aircraft. The additional crewmen, maintenance personnel and facilities needed to support these aircraft were housed in the lower hangar. The ships were provided with of petrol.

===Armament, electronics and protection===
The ship&#x27;s main armament consisted of sixteen quick-firing (QF)  dual-purpose guns in eight twin-gun turrets, four in sponsons on each side of the hull. Unlike the &quot;Illustrious&quot;-class ships, the roofs of the gun turrets were flat and flush with the flight deck. The gun had a maximum range of . Her light anti-aircraft defences included five octuple mounts for QF 2-pounder (&quot;pom-pom&quot;) anti-aircraft (AA) guns, two on the flight deck forward of the island, one on the aft part of the island and two in sponsons on the port side of the hull. A single quadruple 2-pounder mount was also fitted on the port side of the hull. The 2-pounder gun had a maximum range of . The ship was also fitted with 61 Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon in 19 single and 21 twin-gun mounts. These guns had a maximum range of , but some were replaced by 40 mm Bofors AA guns when the ships were transferred to the Pacific Theater as the 20 mm shell was unlikely to destroy a kamikaze before it hit the ship. The Bofors gun had a maximum range of . Two additional quadruple &quot;pom-pom&quot; mounts were added to &quot;Implacable&quot; before she joined the British Pacific Fleet in 1945. By the end of the war, she had 4 single Bofors guns, plus 17 twin and 17 single Oerlikon mounts. By April 1946 these had been reduced to 12 Bofors guns, 8 twin and 14 single Oerlikon guns.

They were fitted with the Type 277 surface-search/height-finding radar on top of the bridge and a Type 293 target indicator radar on the foremast. The ships probably carried Type 279 and Type 281B early-warning radars, based on the radars fitted aboard the &quot;Illustrious&quot;-class carrier late in the war. In addition, Type 282 and Type 285 gunnery radars were mounted on the fire-control directors.

The &quot;Implacable&quot;-class ships had a flight deck protected by of armour. The sides of the hangars were either or . The ends of the hangars were protected by 2-inch bulkheads and the armour of the hangar deck ranged from in thickness. The waterline armour belt was thick, but only covered the central portion of the ship. The belt was closed by 1.5 to 2-inch transverse bulkheads fore and aft. The underwater defence system was a layered system of liquid- and air-filled compartments as used in the &quot;Illustrious&quot; class. The magazines for the 4.5-inch guns lay outside the armoured citadel and were protected by 2 to 3-inch roofs, 4.5-inch sides and 1.5 to 2-inch ends.

==Construction and service==

&quot;Implacable&quot; was laid down by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. at their shipyard in Clydeside on 21 February 1939, as Yard Number 672. Her construction was temporarily suspended in 1940–41, in favour of higher-priority ships needed to fight in the Battle of the Atlantic, before she was launched on 10 December 1942 by Queen Elizabeth. Captain Lachlan Mackintosh was appointed to command the ship in November 1943. She was commissioned on 22 May 1944, and began sea trials which revealed a significant number of problems that required rectification, so the ship was not formally completed until 28 August. &quot;Implacable&quot; was assigned to the Home Fleet and was working up over the next several months while the Fairey Fireflies of 1771 Squadron flew aboard on 10 September. The squadron was followed by the Fairey Barracuda torpedo bombers of 828 and 841 Squadrons that made up 2nd Naval TBR Wing later that month.

Her first mission was to locate the which had left its anchorage in Kaafjord in early October. &quot;Implacable&quot; departed Scapa Flow on 16 October, and a section of her Fireflies spotted the battleship off Håkøya Island near Tromsø two days later. No attack was mounted because the carrier lacked any single-seat fighters aboard to escort the strike aircraft, although they did damage a cargo ship before returning home. On 16 October, the Supermarine Seafires of 887 and 894 Squadrons of 24th Naval Fighter Wing landed aboard. In late October she participated in Operation Athletic off the Norwegian coast, where her aircraft sank six ships and damaged a German submarine for the loss of one Barracuda, while conducting the Royal Navy&#x27;s last wartime torpedo attack. On 1 November Captain Charles Hughes-Hallett relieved Mackintosh and assumed command of the ship. The Barracudas were replaced by the Seafires of 30th Naval Fighter Wing, which consisted of 801 and 880 Squadrons, on 8 November and the Seafires provided air cover for minelaying operations by escort carriers from 11 to 21 November. The next day, Admiral Sir Henry Ruthven Moore, Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, hoisted his flag in &quot;Implacable&quot; and the ship set sail to hunt for a convoy that had been reported near Alsten Island (Operation Provident) with the Seafires and Fireflies of 801, 880, and 1771 Squadrons aboard. Bad weather prevented aircraft from being launched until 27 November, but they located the convoy and sank two merchantmen, including , and damaged six others. MS Rigel was used as a German prisoner of war (POW) transport and the sinking resulted in more than 2,500 dead, mostly POWs. Upon her return to Scapa on 29 November, Moore lowered his flag, but Vice Admiral Sir Frederick Dalrymple-Hamilton, second in command of Home Fleet, hoisted his flag on 6 December for Operation Urbane, another minelaying operation during which her Fireflies helped to sink a German minesweeper. Dalrymple-Hamilton transferred his flag off &quot;Implacable&quot; when she returned to Scapa on 9 December. On 15 December she began a refit at Rosyth preparatory to her transfer to the British Pacific Fleet, which included augmenting her light AA armament.
Upon its completion on 10 March 1945, 801, 828, 880, and 1771 Squadrons reembarked with a total strength of 48 Seafires, 21 Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers and a dozen Fireflies, the largest air group aboard a British carrier thus far. &quot;Implacable&quot; departed six days later to join the BPF and arrived at Port Said, Egypt, on 25 March. While passing through the Suez Canal, a strong gust of wind forced her ashore and it took her escorting tugboats five hours to pull her off. Undamaged, she proceeded on her voyage and reached Sydney on 8 May 1945 (V-E Day).

&quot;Implacable&quot; arrived at the BPF&#x27;s main operating base at Manus Island, in the Admiralty Islands, on 29 May. A week later Rear Admiral Sir Patrick Brind hoisted his flag in preparation for Operation Inmate, an attack on the Japanese naval base at Truk in the Caroline Islands that began on 14 June. Having flown 113 offensive sorties over the two days of the attack, with only one loss of a Seafire to enemy action, the carrier and her escorts returned to Manus Island on 17 June. On 30 June 8th Carrier Air Group was formed, absorbing No. 24 Naval Fighter Wing, to control all of the air units aboard &quot;Implacable&quot;.

After working up, she sailed to join the main body of the BPF off the Japanese coast on 6 July, and rendezvoused with them ten days later. &quot;Implacable&quot; flew off eight Fireflies and a dozen Seafires against targets north of Tokyo on 17 July, but only the Fireflies were able to locate their targets because of bad weather. Eight Fireflies and twenty Seafires attacked targets near Tokyo the next day, before more bad weather halted flying operations until 24–25 July, when the BPF&#x27;s aircraft attacked targets near Osaka and the Inland Sea, crippling the escort carrier . After replenishing, airstrikes resumed on 28 and 30 July, the British sinking the escort near Maizuru. A combination of bad weather, refuelling requirements and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima delayed the resumption of air operations until 9 August. During the day, &quot;Implacable&quot;″s Seafires flew 94 sorties and her Fireflies flew 14 against targets in northern Honshu and southern Hokkaido for the loss of two Seafires. The attacks were repeated the next day, sinking two warships, numerous small merchantmen and destroying numerous railroad locomotives and parked aircraft. The BPF had been scheduled to withdraw after 10 August to prepare for Operation Olympic, the invasion of Kyushu scheduled for November, and the bulk of the force, including &quot;Implacable&quot;, departed for Manus on 12 August. Her aircraft flew over 1,000 sorties since her arrival the previous month.

===Post-war===

She arrived at Sydney on 24 August, and had her hangars refitted to accommodate Allied PoWs and soldiers for repatriation. Having left her air group behind to maximize the numbers of passengers she could carry, the ship arrived at Manila on 25 September, where she loaded over 2,000 British, American and Canadian PoWs. She dropped off the Americans at Pearl Harbor on 5 October and continued on to deliver British and Canadian passengers at Vancouver six days later. Opened for public tours, &quot;Implacable&quot; remained for a week before sailing to Hong Kong to pick up several hundred PoWs and continued onwards to Manila to load 2,114 more passengers. She delivered them to Balikpapan, Borneo, for transhipment to Britain. In their place the carrier embarked 2,126 men of the 7th Australian Division, and their equipment, to return to Australia. She arrived at Sydney on 17 November and sailed on 8 December to load more returning troops from Papua New Guinea. Arriving back at Sydney before Christmas, the ship had her additional bunks, etc., removed to return her to operational status.
In January 1946 her air group flew aboard, minus the disbanded 880 Squadron, and with 1790 Squadron replacing 1771 Squadron. After several days of flying exercises, &quot;Implacable&quot; made a port visit to Melbourne together with her sister &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and several other ships. She became the flagship of Vice Admiral Sir Philip Vian, the newly appointed second in command of the BPF on 31 January. She continued a relaxed schedule of training and port visits until she began a refit on 15 March in Sydney, that lasted until 29 April, when she put to sea to fly on her aircraft and to dump overboard the 16 Lend-Lease Avengers belonging to 828 Squadron (Britain had to either pay for them or dispose of them with the end of the war, and lacked the means to do the former). She sailed for home on 5 May and reached Devonport on 3 June, where Vian struck his flag.

&quot;Implacable&quot; became the deck-landing training carrier for the Home Fleet when she next put to sea in August. On 25 September Captain Aubrey Mansergh assumed command of the ship. Two months later she participated in an exercise with the Home Fleet and was lightly damaged when she collided with the light carrier while docking in Devonport on 7 November. On 1 February 1947, she joined the other ships of the Home Fleet as they rendezvoused with the battleship , which was serving as the royal yacht to escort King George VI as he set out for the first royal tour of South Africa. &quot;Implacable&quot; hosted the king and his family on 7 February, staging a small air show for them after which the queen addressed the crew. After leaving the royals, she made port visits at Freetown, Sierra Leone, and Dakar, Senegal before arriving in the Western Mediterranean for more training. Arriving home on 7 March, she began a lengthy refit at Rosyth on 17 April.
Upon its completion in October 1947 she embarked 813 Squadron, flying Blackburn Firebrand TF.5s, and resumed training. Captain John Stevens relieved Mansergh on 9 February 1948, as the latter had been promoted. In June and July, the ship participated in a series of demonstrations for students in the Royal Navy&#x27;s staff college. Among these was the first carrier landing by a Gloster Meteor jet-powered fighter, flown by Lieutenant-Commander Eric Brown, landings by prototypes of the Westland Wyvern and Short Sturgeon, rocket firing by Fireflies and an &quot;attack&quot; on &quot;Implacable&quot; by motor torpedo boats. She completed a 10-week refit on 10 November and resumed deck-landing practices. She sailed for Gibraltar on 27 February 1949 and 801 Squadron flew aboard on 5 March with its de Havilland Sea Hornets, the day after she arrived there. Admiral Sir Rhoderick McGrigor, commander-in-chief of Home Fleet, hoisted his flag aboard the carrier on 6 March before beginning a short exercise with some of the other ships of Home Fleet. She made port visits in Oslo and Bergen, Norway, in June, hosting King Haakon VII. While berthed at Portsmouth, King Abdullah I of Jordan visited on 19 August and the Prime Minister, Clement Attlee visited 10 days later. 702 Squadron flew aboard with seven de Havilland Sea Vampires in September to conduct carrier evaluations with the new fighter jets that lasted until 11 November. McGrigor was relieved by Admiral Vian ten days later.

&quot;Implacable&quot; spent February and March 1950 training in the Western Mediterranean and Captain H. W. Briggs assumed command on 1 April. She resumed flight training in the Irish Sea and off the western coast of Scotland until she made a port visit to Copenhagen in mid-July. King Frederik IX of Denmark inspected the ship on 18 July and Admiral Vian transferred his flag to &quot;Vanguard&quot; on 11 September. Two days later she was placed in reserve and slowly converted into a training ship by the addition of extra accommodation and classrooms. During this time she was considered for a major reconstruction that would combine her two hangars into a single hangar with a height of and allow her to operate aircraft. In addition her armament would be modernised and the fuel supply for her aircraft would be more than doubled. A similar reconstruction was then in progress for &quot;Victorious&quot;, but it proved to be much more expensive than planned and also took more time than had been estimated. Short of both time and money for the project, the Admiralty cancelled the modernisation in June 1952.

&quot;Implacable&quot; was recommissioned on 16 January 1952 as the flagship of the Home Fleet Training Squadron. On 13 February she arrived at Dover to serve as the port&#x27;s guard ship before and after the state funeral of King George VI, to salute royalty and heads of state arriving by sea. After its conclusion, the ship sailed for the western Mediterranean to rendezvous with her sister for exercises. In June the two sisters represented a fast troop convoy being attacked by aircraft during an air defence exercise. They visited Copenhagen in the next month before returning home. &quot;Implacable&quot; sailed for Gibraltar on 25 September and made a port visit to Lisbon, Portugal, before returning to Devonport for a refit. On 16 November she had an oil fire in her galley that damaged her electrical wiring badly enough to require extending her refit to 20 January 1953. She spent most of February and March in the western Mediterranean together with her sister, participating in exercises before sailing to Southampton for a brief refit.

For the Coronation Fleet Review of Queen Elizabeth II on 15 June, she flew the flag of Vice Admiral John Stevens, her former commanding officer, now Flag Officer, Home Fleet Training Squadron. On 5 September Rear Admiral H. L. F. Adams relieved Stevens and the ship joined &quot;Indefatigable&quot; for fleet exercises off the Scilly Isles and in the Bristol Channel the following month. She ferried the 1st Battalion, Argyll &amp; Sutherland Highlanders from Devonport to Trinidad in response to a crisis in British Guiana, and transported a battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers from Trinidad to Jamaica in October, returning home on 11 November. On 19 August 1954, she was relieved as flagship by the light carrier .

===Decommissioning and disposal===
&quot;Implacable&quot; was decommissioned on 1 September 1954 and sold to Thos. W. Ward for breaking up on 27 October 1955 after being towed to Gareloch. &quot;Implacable&quot; was scrapped at Inverkeithing beginning the following month.

<text>John Johnston Parker (November 20, 1885 – March 17, 1958) was an American politician and United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. He was an unsuccessful nominee for associate justice of the United States Supreme Court in 1930. He was also the United States alternate judge at the Nuremberg trials of accused Nazi war criminals and later served on the United Nations&#x27; International Law Commission.

==Early and family life==

Born on November 20, 1885, in Monroe, North Carolina, Parker was the oldest of four children born to Frances Ann (Johnston) and John Daniel Parker. He was a descendent of William Bradford, a founder of Plymouth Colony, in Massachusetts, and of associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States James Iredell. He was also a brother of Samuel I. Parker, first recipient of the army&#x27;s three highest decorations for valor.

Parker received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1907 from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was elected to membership in Phi Beta Kappa and was class president. He received a Bachelor of Laws in 1908 from the University of North Carolina School of Law. Following a legal apprenticeship in Greensboro, North Carolina, he practiced law in Monroe from 1909 to 1922, and then in Charlotte, North Carolina until 1925.

On November 23, 1910, he married Maria Burgwin Maffitt. They had three children: Sara Burgwin, John Jr., and Francis Iredell.

Parker ran unsuccessfully for political office on three occasions as a Republican. In 1910, he was a candidate for the United States House of Representatives from North Carolina&#x27;s 10th congressional district. In 1916, he was a candidate for Attorney General of North Carolina. Then, in 1920, he was a candidate for Governor of North Carolina.

From 1923 to 1924 Parker served as a special assistant to the Attorney General of the United States. He was tasked with prosecution of former Wilson Administration officials for alleged frauds associated with World War I demobilization. His efforts resulted in no indictments of convictions. Nonetheless, he made favorable impressions upon Justice Department colleagues, including then Attorney General and future Supreme Court Justice Harlan F. Stone.

==Federal judicial service==

Parker received a recess appointment from President Calvin Coolidge on October 3, 1925, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit vacated by Judge Charles Albert Woods. He was nominated to the same position by President Coolidge on December 8, 1925. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 14, 1925, and received his commission the same day. He was a member of the Conference of Senior Circuit Judges (now the Judicial Conference of the United States) from 1931 to 1948, and was a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States from 1948 to 1957. Parker served as Chief Judge from 1948 until his death in 1958.

==Unsuccessful Supreme Court nomination==

On March 21, 1930, Parker was nominated by President Herbert Hoover as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Edward Terry Sanford. His confirmation was opposed by the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) during confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. AFL president William Green specifically faulted Parker for a 1926 Fourth Circuit Court decision which he authored regarding the United Mine Workers, involving antitrust law and yellow-dog contracts. The NAACP joined the opposition in response to remarks Parker had made while a candidate for governor in 1920 about the participation of African Americans in the political process:


NAACP Acting Secretary Walter Francis White sent Parker a telegram asking Parker if he had been quoted correctly, and if he still held such views; Parker never replied. In response, the NAACP initiated a grassroots campaign against the nomination and White testified before the Judiciary Committee. On April 21, 1930, the committee voted 10–6 to forward the nomination to the full Senate with an adverse recommendation. Anticipating a close vote, White sent a telegram to Vice President Charles Curtis imploring him, if the vote ended in a tie, to cast his tie-breaking vote against confirmation. On May 7, 1930, the Senate rejected Parker&#x27;s nomination by a 39–41 roll call vote. This was the first Supreme Court nomination rejected by the Senate since that of Wheeler Hazard Peckham in 1894. Two days later, President Hoover nominated Owen Roberts to fill the vacancy; Roberts was swiftly confirmed on May 20, 1930.

==Later life and death==

From 1945 to 1946, Parker served as an alternate judge on the International Allied Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, Germany. In 1954, he was elected to serve on the United Nations&#x27; International Law Commission.

Parker died on in Washington, D.C., on March 17, 1958, while still in active judicial service. He was buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Charlotte, North Carolina.

<doc id="485352" wikidata="Q758686" url="?curid=485352" title="Audacious-class aircraft carrier">
<text>The &quot;Audacious&quot;-class aircraft carriers were a class of aircraft carriers proposed by the British government in the 1930s – 1940s and completed after the Second World War. The two ships built were heavily modified and diverged over their service lives. They were in operation from 1951 until 1979.

== History ==

The &quot;Audacious&quot; class was originally designed as an expansion of the with double storied hangars. However, it was realised that the hangar height would not be sufficient for the new aircraft that were expected to enter service, so the design was considerably enlarged.
Four ships were laid down between 1942 and 1943 during World War II as part of the British naval buildup – &quot;Africa&quot;, &quot;Irresistible&quot;, &quot;Audacious&quot; and &quot;Eagle&quot;. At the end of hostilities &quot;Africa&quot; and &quot;Eagle&quot; were cancelled. Work on the remaining two was suspended. They would be renamed and built to differing designs in the 1950s.

As the builds of &quot;Audacious&quot; (renamed &quot;Eagle&quot;) and &quot;Irresistible&quot; (renamed &quot;Ark Royal&quot;) progressed they differed so much that they effectively became the lead (and sole) ships of each of their own classes. They formed the backbone of the postwar carrier fleet, and were much modified.

<doc id="485353" wikidata="Q210651" url="?curid=485353" title="HMS Eagle (R05)">
<text>HMS &quot;Eagle&quot; was an of the Royal Navy, in service 1951–1972. Until the arrival of the s in the 21st century, she and her sister were the two largest Royal Navy aircraft carriers ever built.

She was laid down on 24 October 1942 at Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast as one of four ships of the &quot;Audacious&quot; class. These were laid down during the World War II as part of the British naval buildup during that conflict. Two were cancelled at the end of hostilities, and the remaining two were suspended. Originally called &quot;Audacious&quot;, she was renamed &quot;Eagle&quot; (the fifteenth Royal Navy ship to receive this name), taking the name of the cancelled third ship of the class on 21 January 1946. She was finally launched by Princess Elizabeth on 19 March 1946.

Although &quot;Eagle&quot; was completed in October 1951 without an angled flight deck, one was added three years later. In 1952 she took part in the first large NATO naval exercise, Exercise Mainbrace.

==Design and construction==
The s were intended as a larger follow-on to the of aircraft carriers with armoured hangars, with the design being modified before orders being placed to accommodate larger and heavier aircraft, which led to the displacement growing from the originally planned to by the time the ships were ordered. Four ships were ordered, although one, &quot;Africa&quot;, was cancelled before construction began.

The first of the class, &quot;Audacious&quot; was laid down at Harland &amp; Wolff&#x27;s Belfast shipyard on 24 October 1942. Construction was slowed by the need to concentrate resources on more urgent requirements, such as the construction of landing craft, and none of the ships of the class had been launched when the end of the Second World War brought large cuts in the shipbuilding programme for the Royal Navy. The third ship of the class, &quot;Eagle&quot;, which was only 26% complete, was canceled in December 1945, with &quot;Audacious&quot; being renamed &quot;Eagle&quot; on 21 January 1946. The newly renamed &quot;Eagle&quot; was launched by Princess Elizabeth on 19 March 1946, but construction of the two carriers was slowed for three years while the Royal Navy&#x27;s requirements for aircraft carriers was reviewed, it being eventually decided to complete &quot;Eagle&quot; to a similar standard to that planned in 1945, while &quot;Ark Royal&quot; would be completed to an improved design. &quot;Eagle&quot; was finally completed on 1 October 1951.

As built, &quot;Eagle&quot; was long overall, at the waterline and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of at deep load. Displacement was standard, with full load of up to . Eight Admiralty three-drum water-tube boilers fed steam to Parsons single-reduction geared steam turbines rated at which in turn drove four propeller shafts. This gave a speed of at deep load.

==Service==

&quot;Eagle&quot; started Sea trials on 31 October 1951, with initial flying trials starting on 14 February 1952 and the ship being accepted into service on 1 March 1952. &quot;Eagle&quot; continued to work up her crew, embarking an initial air wing equipped with two squadrons of Supermarine Attacker jet fighters, two squadrons of Fairey Firefly anti-submarine aircraft and a squadron of Blackburn Firebrand attack aircraft, and in September 1952, took part in the big NATO naval exercise, Exercise Mainbrace off the coast of Norway and Denmark.

In early 1953 &quot;Eagle&quot; visited the Mediterranean, before returning to home waters when in June she took part in the Fleet Review at Spithead to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. She joined the Mediterranean Fleet in February 1954, before returning to British waters in May.

&quot;Eagle&quot; was refitted at Devonport Dockyard from June 1954 to February 1955. In order to ease operations with jet aircraft, the ship was fitted with a 5.5 degree angled flight deck, which owing to the width of &quot;Eagle&quot;″s flight deck, could be accommodated without major structural changes, although it required the ship&#x27;s arrestor gear to be rearranged, and removal of nine Bofors guns (one Mark-6 six barrelled mount and three single mounts). A mirror landing aid was also fitted. Following work-up, &quot;Eagle&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean before taking part in the autumn NATO exercises in the North Atlantic. In May 1956, &quot;Eagle&quot; was deployed to Malta to work up for another stint in the Mediterranean Fleet.

&quot;Eagle&quot;″s first wartime service came in 1956, when she took part in the Suez Crisis with Captain H C D MacLean, DSC in command. The ship&#x27;s aircraft of that period included Westland Wyverns, Douglas Skyraiders, Hawker Sea Hawks and de Havilland Sea Venoms.

===Rebuild===

The Admiralty had originally planned to give &quot;Eagle&quot; a complete rebuild on the lines of , but due to high costs, plans to fit new geared steam turbines and a stretched hull were abandoned. &quot;Eagle&quot; was instead given a more austere but extensive modernization that provided greater radar and processing capability than the systems fitted to &quot;Victorious&quot;. The changes included major improvements to the accommodation, including the installation of air conditioning. The island was completely rebuilt and a 3D Type 984 radar was installed, with processing capacity to track and rank 100 targets, twice the capability of the early 984 system fitted to &quot;Hermes&quot; and &quot;Victorious&quot;. The flight deck was modified and included a new 2½ inch armoured deck with a full 8.5 degree angle, two new steam catapults (BS5s, stroke on the port side forward and stroke in the waist) were fitted as well as new arrester gear (DAX I) and mirror sights. As well as an overhaul of the DC electrical systems, AC generators were also fitted to give additional power.

It was decided that &quot;Eagle&quot; would have her anti-aircraft guns removed and replaced by the Seacat missile system, though her aft four 4.5 inch gun turrets were retained, and all of her original machinery and equipment would be fully overhauled.

In 1959 &quot;Eagle&quot; entered Devonport Dockyard to begin this extensive refit, and by May 1964 it was complete. Standard displacement had increased to around 44,100 tons (full load displacement was 54,100 tons) and &quot;Eagle&quot; was now the largest aircraft carrier in the Royal Navy. Total cost of the refit was £31 million. The refit was intended to extend her operational life for another 10 years, and she now operated Blackburn Buccaneer, de Havilland Sea Vixen, Supermarine Scimitar and Fairey Gannet aircraft, but water-cooled jet blast deflectors (needed to operate the RN Phantom fighters) were not fitted, and therefore the full potential of the ship was not realized. In 1964-5 it was claimed &quot;Eagle&quot; and the proposed CVA01 and half sized &quot;Hermes&quot; would be a viable three carrier fleet until 1980. &quot;Victorious&quot; would have been replaced by CVA01 in 1973. In reality the 1958 Royal Navy assessment was that with affordable modernization of the existing carrier fleet, only HMS &quot;Hermes&quot; would be effective after 1975, and she was too small. These assessments by the Director of Naval Construction in November 1958 were very accurate, taking into account the slower than expected pace of reconstruction, corrosion of war-built hulls, the obsolete power trains except in &quot;Victorious&quot;, and the cheap unsatisfactory mix of DC electrics with AC add-on generators where needed in &quot;Eagle&quot; and &quot;Ark Royal&quot;.

===Refit===
In early 1966 &quot;Eagle&quot; was refitted at Devonport once more and was fitted with a single DAX II arrestor wire (no.3, her other wires were DAX I). She was recommissioned in 1967.

&quot;Eagle&quot; was originally intended to receive a further refit that would have enabled her to comfortably operate the McDonnell Douglas Phantom (she had already successfully operated them in trials). Her two BS5 catapults fitted in her 1959–64 refit were already powerful enough to launch fully laden F-4s, but her Jet Blast Deflectors were still of the older steel plate design, and the reheated exhaust of the Phantom&#x27;s Rolls-Royce Spey engines required water-cooled deflector plates. It was also planned to fit bridle catchers to the catapults as a cost-saving measure, as the bridles would otherwise be lost after a single launch.

During the Phantom FG1 trials (involving three newly delivered aircraft operated by 700P NAS) the longer waist catapult was used, and a thick steel plate was chained to the deck behind the catapult to absorb the heat of the Phantom&#x27;s afterburners. The JBD was not used as it would have been damaged, and after each launch fire hoses sprayed water on the deck plate to cool it down before the next aircraft could be loaded onto the catapult.

While fitting adequate blast deflectors and other minor changes for Phantom operation were estimated to cost no more than £5 million in 1968, refitting the ship to operate with a modern airgroup of Phantoms into the late 1970s was clearly going to cost much more, and the new Conservative government in 1970 confirmed plans to convert to a Commando carrier and withdraw &quot;Eagle&quot;. In February 1972, the Secretary of State for Defence, Lord Carrington, estimated refitting &quot;Eagle&quot; to operate Phantoms would cost £25–30 million, and the overall manpower and cost requirements of operating two large strike carriers were beyond Britain, particularly as &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was expected to serve to the end of the 1970s with only two short refits. To preserve &quot;Eagle&quot; in maintained or unmaintained reserve would require refits, estimated at around £4 million, every 3–4 years, and maintenance crew of 350–400 Navy personnel for £1.5–2 million a year. Reactivation would take four and a half months to a year, while maintaining a Sea Vixen squadron was unjustified expense for aircraft that were obsolete. The refit of &quot;Ark Royal&quot; cost £32 million to allow operations of a fully modern airwing, though it was generally accepted that even after her return to service she considered to be in a significantly worse overall material state in comparison to &quot;Eagle&quot;. Of the 48 Phantom FG1s ordered for the FAA, 20 were diverted to the RAF equipping 43 Sqn, though some were loaned back to the Navy to equip the Phantom FG1 training unit 767 NAS which trained both RN and RAF Phantom crews until it was disbanded in 1972.

===Decommissioning===

The 1966 decision to run-down the RN fixed wing carrier fleet (&quot;Centaur&quot; had already been laid up as an accommodation ship, and &quot;Victorious&quot; was soon to be prematurely scrapped, following a minor fire) meant &quot;Eagle&quot;″s days were numbered. &quot;Eagle&quot; was paid off in January 1972 at Portsmouth after 20 years and 4 months of service, and was stripped of reusable equipment (radars and missile systems primarily), after which she was towed to Devonport where she was placed in reserve and moored in a stretch of the River Tamar known as the Hamoaze. In 1974, she was released from her moorings, towed up river, and secured in number 10 Dock, Devonport Dockyard, where she was further stripped of essential spares for &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, before being towed back to her mooring position.

Up until 1976 she was officially still in reserve, but having been exhausted as a source of spares for &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, &quot;Eagle&quot; was then sold for scrap and towed from Devonport on 14 October 1978 to Cairnryan near Stranraer to be broken up, clearing her mooring space for her sister and arriving there five days later. The lower hull of &quot;Eagle&quot; was still being broken up when her sister &quot;Ark Royal&quot; arrived at Cairnryan for demolition on 28 September 1980. One of her anchors (along with one of &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s) stands guard at the entrance to the Fleet Air Arm Museum in Yeovilton.

<text>HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; (R09) was an aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy and, when she was decommissioned in 1979, was the Royal Navy&#x27;s last remaining conventional catapult and arrested-landing aircraft carrier. She was the first aircraft carrier to be equipped with an angled flight deck at its commissioning; her sister ship, , was the Royal Navy&#x27;s first angle-decked aircraft carrier after modification in 1954. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was the only non-United States vessel to operate the McDonnell Douglas Phantom at sea.

==Construction and modifications==

&quot;Ark Royal&quot; was the sister ship to , which was initially named HMS &quot;Audacious&quot;, hence the name of the class. Four &quot;Audacious&quot;-class ships were laid down, but two (HMS &quot;Africa&quot; and the original HMS &quot;Eagle&quot;) were cancelled when the Second World War ended, and construction of the other two was suspended for several years. Both completed ships were extensively upgraded throughout their lifetimes.

A contract was placed with Cammell Laird on the River Mersey on , to build the first ship of the class. While it had been originally planned to name the ship &quot;Irresistible&quot;, this was changed to &quot;Ark Royal&quot; before ordering to commemorate the aircraft carrier lost in 1941. The ship, which was the largest warship ever to be built by Cammell Laird, was laid down at Laird&#x27;s Birkenhead shipyard on , as yard number 1119. Construction was slow, and was suspended after the end of the Second World War to allow the ship&#x27;s design to be updated to better suit her for the operation of modern aircraft. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was launched by Queen Elizabeth, wife of King George VI, on . She was completed on , and commissioned the next day at Devonport.

In this time, she underwent redesign and, when completed, she was markedly different from her sister ship. Shortly before her launch from the Cammell Laird shipyard, an image of the ship painted with her white undercoat was captured by the pictorialist photographer E. Chambré Hardman. This has been exhibited many times under the name &#x27;Where Great Ships Are Built&#x27; and later &#x27;Birth of the Ark Royal&#x27;. When commissioned, she had a 5.5° partially angled flight deck, two steam catapults capable of launching aircraft weighing up to , a deck-edge lift on the port side (the first British ship to be fitted with such a device), modified armament, and the new mirror landing system. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was the first ship to be constructed with an angled flight deck and steam catapults, as opposed to having them added after launching. These innovations allowed aircraft to land and take off from the carrier at the same time. Her flight deck as built was .
A further four years passed before she commenced her sea trials.

About a year after commissioning, her forward port guns were removed to improve aircraft operations over the angled deck. Four years later, the port deck-edge lift and the forward starboard 4.5 inch guns were also removed. After the 1964 refit, only one twin 4.5 inch gun mount remained aft on port and starboard side. From 1967 to February 1970, she underwent a refit which was a major rebuild to her structure, but only an austere update to her electronic equipment, and was confined to changes needed to operate the RN&#x27;s version of the Phantom. Prior to, and during the refit, concerns over costs, the age of the hull, and changing political opinions over naval requirements threatened the refit, and even a possibility that the ship could be scrapped. However, convincing arguments to retain and upgrade the carrier won through.

The refit cost around £30 million, far less than the modernisation of &quot;Eagle&quot;, but also added several improvements, which allowed her to comfortably operate the larger Phantom and Buccaneer Mk.2 aircraft. Her modifications included a full 8.5° angled flight deck, new and far more powerful steam catapults, bridle-catchers, heavy-grade jet-blast deflectors (both of which &quot;Eagle&quot; did not receive), and heavy-weight arrestor cables. Twelve hundred miles of new cabling was installed, but the ship was not completely rewired and retained old DC electrics. A modified island (with a different arrangement from &quot;Eagle&quot;), and a partially new electronic suite were also added, though some of her original radars, such as 983 height-finders were retained, and she did not receive the 3-D air-search radar set that her sister had fitted, instead two double-array 966 versions of the standard RN 965 long-range system were fitted and one of the new 986 sets. Significantly, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was the first and only RN carrier fitted with a USN carrier approach system, the AN/SPN-35 radar, increasing night aircraft operational capability and safety. Her flight deck size was increased port aft, giving her extra deck-park space for her air group that &quot;Eagle&quot; did not have. She was also fitted for four Seacat missile launchers, which were never installed, so she emerged from refit with no defensive armament except for Corvus decoy launchers. Significantly, there was little more than an overhaul of her steam turbines and boilers, meaning that mechanically she was very dated; however, the stripping-out of &quot;Eagle&quot; meant that for a time essential spares were available. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was then scheduled for at the most only five years&#x27; more service by a new government policy to scrap the carriers by 1975. Intensive maintenance as well as a new programme of continuous servicing and repair (with RN maintenance ships always in her task groups) kept her going until late 1978, though increasing mechanical and electrical failures led to her decommissioning in early 1979.

At her entry into service, the ship had a complement of up to 50 aircraft, comprising Sea Hawks, Sea Venoms, Gannets, Skyraiders, and various helicopters. As later aircraft types grew in size and complexity, her air group fell to below 40 when she left service in 1978.

==Operational history==
&quot;Ark Royal&quot; participated in many exercises as part of the British fleet and NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) squadrons, but saw no combat duty. She was not involved in the Suez Crisis in Egypt of 1956, about a year after her commissioning; she was on her way there when she ran a main propeller shaft bearing, and had to return to Devonport for a major refit. &quot;Eagle&quot; replaced her at Suez. In 1963, she carried out trials for a new type of Vertical/Short Take Off and Landing (V/STOL) aircraft, the Hawker P.1127, which later developed into the Hawker Siddeley Harrier. The same aircraft, now having been redesigned and developed as the British Aerospace Sea Harrier, was later accepted as the primary strike capability of the future third and last &quot;Ark Royal&quot; from 1980 onwards.

She was part of the Beira Patrol enforcing the naval blockade of Rhodesia in 1965. The 1966 Defence White Paper planned the end of British aircraft carriers in the early 1970s, but she went into dock for her refit to head off dockyard redundancies and the likely political issues. A new government re-examined the case for carriers, finding that shore-based aircraft could not provide adequate cover for British concerns &#x27;East of Suez&#x27;.

On 9 November 1970, whilst in the Mediterranean to participate in a NATO exercise, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; collided with &quot;Bravyy&quot;, a Soviet Navy which was shadowing her (a common practice during the Cold War). &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was slightly damaged, while the Soviet destroyer sustained minor damage and two missing crew. &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s commanding officer, Captain Raymond Lygo, was cleared of blame at the subsequent court martial.
The ship featured in the 1960s British television series &quot;Not Only... But Also&quot; starring Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. When commissions ended, items were fired off the catapult into the sea, including pianos and once a toilet complete with paying-off pennant.

By 1970, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; had a complement of 39 aircraft. This typically comprised twelve Phantom FG Mk.1s, of 892 Naval Air Squadron, fourteen Buccaneer S Mk.2s of 809 Squadron, four Gannet AEW (Airborne Early Warning) Mk.3s of B Flight 849 Squadron, six Sea King HAS Mk.1s of 824 Squadron, two Wessex HAR Mk.1s of the Ship&#x27;s Flight, and one Gannet COD Mk.4. later replaced by an AEW3. The Buccaneers doubled as tanker aircraft, using buddy refuelling pods, and as long-range reconnaissance aircraft with bomb bay-mounted camera packs. In July 1976, she represented Britain at the United States Bicentennial Celebration in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

In 1972, the Buccaneers aboard &quot;Ark Royal&quot; took part in a long-range strike mission over British Honduras in Central America shortly before its independence as a constitutional monarchy named Her Majesty&#x27;s Government of Belize to deter a possible invasion by Guatemala, which had long-standing territorial claims.

In 1977, under the flag of Admiral Sir Henry Leach KCB Commander-in-Chief Fleet, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; led the Royal Navy&#x27;s tribute to and celebrations of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Silver Jubilee at Spithead.

In the mid-1970s, the ship made a return to television. A major BBC documentary series, one of the earliest fly on the wall documentaries, &quot;Sailor&quot; was made, showing life on board the ship during a February-to-July 1976 Western Atlantic deployment. Her commanding officer at this time was Captain Wilfred Graham, a later Flag Officer Portsmouth, and the ship&#x27;s Commander (executive officer) was Commander David Cowling. The theme tune for the programme was Sailing by Rod Stewart – a song that came to be associated with the ship and her successor. She visited Fort Lauderdale, Florida, from 30 May until 14 June 1978.
She entered HMNB Devonport on 4 December 1978, and was decommissioned on 14 February 1979. Like her sister &quot;Eagle&quot;, she had a relatively short (24 year) life, and when the White Ensign lowered for the last time, the Royal Navy no longer had fixed-wing aircraft at sea, a situation that persisted until the acceptance into service of HMS Invincible in March 1980 and the completion of the conversion of HMS Hermes to operate the Sea Harrier in mid-1981. On 29 March 1980, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) announced that she would be sold for scrap, and so ended plans to preserve her. She left Devonport on 22 September 1980 under tow, to be scrapped at Cairnryan near Stranraer in Scotland, arriving on 28 September. When arriving at the breakers, her sister ship &quot;Eagle&quot; was in the final process of being broken up there. Breaking-up of &quot;Ark Royal&quot; took until 1983. During this period, many former crew travelled to the breakers&#x27; jetty at the remote corner of Loch Ryan to pay their last respects; some were reduced to tears when seeing the ship being torn to pieces. However, various parts of the ship remain as souvenirs or memorials; for instance, an anchor (along with an anchor from her sister ship &quot;Eagle&quot;) outside the Fleet Air Arm Museum at RNAS Yeovilton. One of her other anchors is in Armada Way, Plymouth, near Plymouth Hoe.
==Legacy==
While &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s career spanned 24 years from the time of her commissioning (her name was a household word), she spent as much time in refit; repair and reserve and modernisation as in commissioned service (12 years). It required a lot of effort from her engineers to keep her serviceable between yard periods. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; had been poorly preserved during her lengthy construction from 1942 to 1955, and much of her machinery was obsolete by her completion, including her dated DC electrics, supplemented later by some AC systems, resulting in a ship that experienced regular defects and mechanical failure. &quot;Eagle&quot; was a more reliable and well-built ship, and spent far more time at sea than her sister. The scrapping of &quot;Ark Royal&quot; in 1980, two years after &quot;Eagle&quot;, marked the end of conventional fixed-wing aircraft operations aboard Royal Navy carriers. She had borne so many innovations, yet her replacement was not equipped with any of these. There was some discussion about preserving her as a museum ship, and some private funds were raised; the MOD would not sanction these efforts. The Fleet Air Arm Museum has subsequently mimicked the ship&#x27;s island and flight deck in its central hall as an &quot;Aircraft Carrier Experience&quot; exhibition.

The remained in service after her, but had been converted to a helicopter commando carrier in 1971, and then as a V/STOL carrier. The much smaller could carry only vertical/short takeoff and landing aircraft and helicopters. The two new carriers, which were commissioned in 2017 and 2019, were originally designed to operate V/STOL aircraft. Despite expert advice, and in an attempt to reduce costs, the UK government requested that the new carriers be modified to operate conventional CATOBAR (catapult-assisted takeoff and barrier/arrested recovery) aircraft. Fitting electromagnetic catapults would have required huge structural changes and an upgrade of the ships&#x27; energy generation, which proved unfeasible, and resulted in a decision to return to the original configuration.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Fyodorovich Volchkov (; August 10, 1902 – 1978) was a judge during the Nuremberg trials after World War II. He was the alternate Soviet judge during the proceedings. Before taking up the practice of law he had worked in the film business.

== Life ==
As Arkady Poltorak writes in his book The Nuremberg Epilogue, Alexander Fedorovich was his colleague in the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. Volchkov worked for many years in the public prosecutor&#x27;s office and also worked in the Soviet embassy in Great Britain. As he dealt with issues of international law, he also worked as a lecturer in the pre-war years and, like Poltorak, found himself in the role of an enforcer of military justice during the Second World War. Thanks to his knowledge of international law and his command of English, Volchkov was appointed Deputy Representative of the Soviet Union at the International War Tribunal in Nuremberg.
