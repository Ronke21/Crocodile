<text>The Newfoundland and Labrador New Democratic Party (NL NDP) is a social democratic political party in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. It is a provincial section of the federal New Democratic Party. 

It was formed in 1961 as the successor to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and the Newfoundland Democratic Party. The party first contested the 1962 provincial election. The party won its first seat in the House of Assembly in 1984 and has been represented in the legislature since 1990.

Lorraine Michael was elected leader of the NL NDP at the party&#x27;s leadership election on May 28, 2006. She led the party during the 2007 and 2011 general elections, each time improving the party&#x27;s share of vote from the previous election. In the 2011 election, a record five NDP MHAs were elected under her leadership. Michael was succeeded by former Fish, Food and Allied Workers Union president, Earle McCurdy on March 7, 2015. Following McCurdy&#x27;s resignation in September 2017, Michael was named interim leader. In April 2018, MHA Gerry Rogers was elected leader. Rogers resigned the following year and economist Alison Coffin was acclaimed leader on March 5, 2019. In the 2021 provincial election, the party won two seats. In October 2021, MHA Jim Dinn was chosen as the party&#x27;s interim leader following the resignation of Alison Coffin. He was later acclaimed as the permanent leader.

==History==

===Founding===
The NL NDP is the successor party to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). The Newfoundland CCF was founded in 1955 when Sam Drover, a member of the Newfoundland House of Assembly for White Bay (Trinity North) left the provincial Liberal Party to sit as a member of the CCF. Drover became leader of the new provincial party, which fielded ten candidates, mostly in rural districts, in the 1956 provincial election. The CCF party failed to win any seats: Drover lost his own riding, winning 237 votes to the Liberal candidate&#x27;s 1,437.

The CCF did not run candidates in the 1959 election, but supported the Newfoundland Democratic Party. This party had been organised by the Newfoundland Federation of Labour with the support of the Canadian Labour Congress, to protest the Liberal government&#x27;s decertification of the International Woodworkers of America in the course of a logging strike. The Newfoundland Democratic Party ran eighteen candidates, none of whom was elected. The party was led by Ed Finn, Jr. In 1961, the federal New Democratic Party was founded in with the merger of the federal CCF and the Canadian Labour Congress. The Newfoundland Democratic Party followed suit becoming the Newfoundland New Democratic Party with Finn leading the NL NDP into the 1962 provincial election and Calvin Normore doing so in 1966.

===1962–1984===
Since the 1962 general election, the party has run candidates in all of Newfoundland and Labrador&#x27;s general elections. From 1962 to 1984, the party was led by seven different leaders and contested seven provincial elections. The party won an average of 3.3% of the vote in those elections and were unable to elect a candidate to the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly.

===Peter Fenwick years===
Peter Fenwick succeeded Fonse Faour as party leader in 1981. In a 1984 by-election, Fenwick won the Labrador riding of Menihek becoming the first New Democrat to be elected in the province. In the 1985 general election the party won 14% of the popular vote, nearly quadrupling their share of the vote they received three years earlier. Even with their successful results Fenwick was the only NL NDP candidate elected. In 1986, Gene Long won the party&#x27;s second seat in a by-election in the riding of St. John&#x27;s East (since renamed Signal Hill-Quidi Vidi). Also that year Fenwick was arrested, along with union representatives, for participating in a strike by the Newfoundland Association of Public Employees (NAPE). Fenwick retired from politics in 1989 and did not run in that year&#x27;s election. Cle Newhook replaced Fenwick as party leader and the NL NDP was once again left without representation after the 1989 election when both ridings they had held were won by Progressive Conservatives.

===Jack Harris years===
St. John&#x27;s lawyer and former Member of Parliament Jack Harris won back the riding of St. John&#x27;s East in a 1990 by-election after Progressive Conservative MHA Shannie Duff resigned to run for St. John&#x27;s Mayor. Harris took nearly 50% of the vote in the by-election beating the Liberal candidate by 740 votes. In 1992, Harris succeed Newhook as party leader and led the party into the 1993 general election. For the first, and only, time in the party&#x27;s history, they ran a full slate of candidates throughout the province. While they won almost 10,000 more votes than the previous election and increased their share of the popular vote from 3.4% to 7.4%, Harris remained the only New Democrat elected. The 1996 general election resulted in a landslide majority government for the Liberal Party, the New Democrats received only 4.45% of the vote and nominated candidates in only 20 of the provinces 48 ridings. Though the party suffered their worst electoral result in 14 years, Harris was easily re-elected in the new riding of Signal Hill-Quidi Vidi. He was re-elected to the Legislature in the 1999, and 2003 elections. Randy Collins was elected in Labrador West in 1999, and re-elected in 2003 before resigning in 2007. Harris resigned in 2006.

===Lorraine Michael===
Lorraine Michael won the leadership of the Newfoundland and Labrador NDP in 2006. After succeeding Harris as leader she was elected in his former district of Signal Hill-Quidi Vidi several months later. In the 2007 provincial election, Michael was the only New Democrat elected, though she increased her party&#x27;s share of the popular vote.

Between 2007 and 2011, polling for the NL NDP remained below 10%p in public opinion polls behind the Liberal Party and governing Progressive Conservatives. However, after the federal NDP&#x27;s success in the 2011 federal election, where they formed the official opposition, support for Michael&#x27;s New Democrats saw a surge in support. In a Corporate Research Associates (CRA) poll conducted just weeks after the federal election in May 2011, the NL NDP support rose to 20%. For the first time in its history the party was statistically tied for second place with the Liberal Party, who were at 22%. The New Democrats&#x27; gains came at the expense of the governing Progressive Conservatives who fell to 57%. The NL NDP surpassed the Liberals in polling in September 2011, and won just under 25% of the popular vote, and five seats, in the October 11, 2011, general election. The Progressive Conservatives won their third straight majority government and while the New Democrats placed second in the popular vote, they finished third behind the Liberal Party in seats.

On October 21, 2013, it was revealed that Michael had received a letter from her caucus over the previous weekend calling for a leadership election to be held in 2014. The caucus felt that without renewal in the party they would have trouble attracting quality candidates and public support in the 2015 election. In an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), Michael said she was shocked by the letter and felt betrayed by her caucus. Michael said she planned to sit down with her caucus before making a decision on what to do.

The letter led to a public fight within the NDP, particularly among the caucus. Both Gerry Rogers and George Murphy said they regretted sending the letter and supported Michael, while Dale Kirby and Chris Mitchelmore stood behind what they had written in the letter. Following the caucus meeting Michael agreed to having a vote on her leadership at the next annual general meeting of the party. Both Kirby and Mitchelmore later announced they were leaving the caucus to sit as Independent MHAs, and both men joined the Liberal Party in February 2014. The dispute over Michael&#x27;s leadership also led to members of the provincial executive to resign. In May 2014, a party convention reaffirmed her leadership with the support of 75% of delegates. Michael announced on January 6, 2015 that she would step down as leader after the party performed poorly in four recent by-elections. While she was resigning as leader, Michael also stated that she planned to seek re-election as an MHA. Her term as leader ended when her successor was chosen in a leadership election held on March 7, 2015.

===Earle McCurdy===

Three candidates sought to succeed Michael as leader: former Fish, Food and Allied Workers Union leader Earle McCurdy, former Labrador City town councilor Mike Goosney and former NDP official Chris Bruce.

McCurdy won the election with 68% of the vote on March 7, 2015. He did not win his seat in the 2015 provincial election. Therefore, Michael subsequently served as NDP House Leader in the following parliamentary sessions.

On September 19, 2017, McCurdy announced his resignation as Leader, effective September 30, 2017. Following McCurdy&#x27;s resignation, MHA and former leader Lorraine Michael was named interim leader.

===Gerry Rogers===
In April 2018, MHA Gerry Rogers was elected leader defeating economist Alison Coffin. Rogers was the first openly LGBTQ+ person to lead a political party in Newfoundland and Labrador. On February 12, 2019, Rogers announced she would be stepping down as leader and not seeking re-election in the upcoming 2019 election.

===Alison Coffin===
Memorial University economics professor and consultant Alison Coffin was acclaimed leader on March 5, 2019. Coffin led the party into the 2019 provincial election; despite only nominating 14 candidates (out of a possible 40) the party won three seats. Coffin won St. John’s East-Quidi Vidi holding it for the NDP, while the party led St. John’s Centre, and won an upset in Labrador West.

Coffin led the party into the 2021 provincial election. She was personally defeated in her district of St. John&#x27;s East-Quidi Vidi; while the party held St. John&#x27;s Centre and Labrador West. Coffin filed for a recount. On May 12, 2021, Supreme Court Justice Donald Burrage rejected Coffin&#x27;s bid for a recount, arguing that there was not sufficient evidence.

On October 16, 2021, Coffin lost a leadership review by party members. She later chose to resign on October 19 and was replaced by MHA Jim Dinn as interim leader.

===Jim Dinn===
In October 2021, MHA Jim Dinn was chosen as the party&#x27;s interim leader following the resignation of Alison Coffin. Prior to becoming a politician, Dinn had served as president of the Newfoundland and Labrador Teachers’ Association. On March 7, 2022, Torngat Mountains MHA Lela Evans joined the NDP caucus. On March 28, 2023, Dinn was acclaimed as permanent leader after the nomination deadline passed with no other candidates. On July 16, 2024, MHA Lela Evans rejoined the PC Party.

==Relationship with the federal party==
The NL NDP is affiliated with the federal New Democratic Party. Two of the three New Democratic Party Members of Parliament ever elected to the House of Commons of Canada from Newfoundland and Labrador went on to lead the provincial party: 
* Fonse Faour, who won a by-election in 1978 in the federal riding of Humber—St. George&#x27;s—St. Barbe, and was re-elected the following year in the 1979 federal election in the renamed riding of Humber—Port au Port—St. Barbe. Faour was defeated in the subsequent 1980 federal election. He then went on to serve as leader of the provincial party.
* Jack Harris, won a 1987 by-election in the riding of St. John&#x27;s East, but was defeated the following year in the 1988 federal election. Harris served as leader of the provincial party before being re-elected to represent St. John&#x27;s East in the 2008 federal election. Harris retired in 2021.

==Leaders==
* Sam Drover, 1955–1956. Although not elected as leader of the party, Samuel Drover effectively led the NL NDP&#x27;s predecessor party, the CCF, in the 1956 provincial election. In 1955, Drover had crossed the floor from the Liberal Party to sit in the opposition as a CCF MHA.
* Ed Finn, Jr., 1959–1963. Ed Finn became co-leader of the Newfoundland Democratic Party upon its inception in 1959, and assumed the leadership of the CCF and the New Democratic Party. Finn narrowly lost his bid for a seat in the House of Assembly in the 1962 provincial election when he ran for the NL NDP in Humber West. He left Newfoundland and Labrador in 1963 to pursue a career as a labour researcher, writer, and journalist.
*Calvin Normore, 1963—1966, led the party during the 1966 provincial election. Head of the Corner Brook Labor Council and vice-president of the Newfoundland Federation of Labour, he had been co-leader of the Newfoundland Democratic Party in 1959.

From 1966 to 1970, the Newfoundland and Labrador New Democratic Party was without a formal leader, relying instead upon local committees throughout the province, but Thoms was essentially de facto leader. He was a consistently outspoken voice for social democracy and social justice until his death in 1979.
* John Connors, 1970–1974. John Connors took the reins of the party in 1970 at a difficult time, as the electorate became sharply divided over whether to continue supporting the Liberal Party. Connors was a candidate for the NL NDP in the 1968 federal election, and was one of only three NL NDP candidates in the 1972 provincial campaign. He later pursued a career at the Marine Institute.
* Gerry Panting, 1974–1977. Gerald Panting led the party from 1974 to 1977. Panting was a distinguished historian and founder of the Maritime History Group at Memorial University of Newfoundland.

* John Greene, 1977–1980. A schoolteacher from Fogo Island, Greene led the NL NDP from 1977 to 1980 and played a significant role in building the party. He came close to winning a seat in the House of Assembly, giving a strong showing in the televised leaders debate. Due to his leadership the NL NDP became a recognized provincial party. This helped set the stage for the party&#x27;s later electoral success. Greene later became an author and remained active in various human rights organizations.
* Fonse Faour, 1980–1981. Fonse Faour served a one-year term a leader from 1980 to 1981 after serving as the party&#x27;s first Member of Parliament from Newfoundland and Labrador in the House of Commons.

He then became provincial party leader but resigned after a year due to the difficulties in maintaining his law practice while being party leader. Faour later worked in senior positions with the provincial public service and served as Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer of the Public Service Commission. In 2003, Faour was appointed to the trial division of the Newfoundland and Labrador Supreme Court.
* Peter Fenwick, 1981–1989. Leader from 1981 to 1989, in 1984 Fenwick set a landmark in provincial history by becoming the first New Democrat to be elected to the House of Assembly, sitting as the member for the former Labrador district of Menihek. He was re-elected in 1985. An outspoken leader, he was jailed in 1986 along with union representatives who participated in a strike by the Newfoundland Association of Public Employees.

Newhook now works as a consultant in St. John&#x27;s.
* Jack Harris, 1992–2006. First elected as Member of Parliament for St. John&#x27;s East in 1987, he was elected to the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly in the 1990 provincial election and was acclaimed leader of the NL NDP in 1992. He was re-elected to the Legislature in the 1993, 1996, 1999 and 2003 elections. In October 2008, Harris was a second time elected Member of Parliament for the riding of St. John&#x27;s East receiving 74.1% of the vote—the fifth-highest winning percentage in Canada.
* Lorraine Michael, 2006–2015, 2017-2018 &quot;(interim)&quot;.

<text>Vissarion Grigoryevich Belinsky (; – ) was a Russian literary critic of Westernizing tendency. Belinsky played one of the key roles in the career of poet and publisher Nikolay Nekrasov and his popular magazine &quot;Sovremennik&quot;. He was the most influential of the Westernizers, especially among the younger generation. He worked primarily as a literary critic, because that area was less heavily censored than political pamphlets. He agreed with Slavophiles that society had precedence over individualism, but he insisted the society had to allow the expression of individual ideas and rights. He strongly opposed Slavophiles on the role of Orthodoxy, which he considered a retrograde force. He emphasized reason and knowledge, and attacked autocracy and theocracy.

==Biography==
Born in Sveaborg, part of Helsinki, Vissarion Belinsky lived in the town of Chembar (now Belinsky in Belinsky District of Penza Oblast) and in Penza, where he studied in gymnazia (1825–1829). In 1829–1832 he was a student of Moscow University. In Moscow he published his first famous articles.

In 1839 Belinsky went to St. Petersburg, Russia, where he became a respected critic and editor of two major literary magazines: &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot; (&quot;Notes of the Fatherland&quot;), and &quot;Sovremennik&quot; (&quot;The Contemporary&quot;). In both magazines Belinsky worked with younger Nikolay Nekrasov.

He was unlike most of the other Russian intellectuals of the 1830s and 1840s. The son of a rural medical doctor, he was not a wealthy aristocrat. The fact that Belinsky was relatively underprivileged meant, among other effects, that he was mainly self-educated; this was partly due to being expelled from Moscow University for political activity. But it was less for his philosophical skill that Belinsky was admired and more for emotional commitment and fervor. “For me, to think, to feel, to understand and to suffer are one and the same thing,” he liked to say. This was, of course, true to the Romantic ideal, to the beliefs that real understanding comes not only from mere thinking (reason), but also from intuitive insight. This combination of thinking and feeling pervaded Belinsky&#x27;s life.

Ideologically, Belinsky shared, but with exceptional intellectual and moral passion, the central value of most of Westernizer intelligentsia: the notion of the individual self, a person (&quot;lichnost’&quot;(личность)), that which makes people human, and gives them dignity and rights. With this idea in hand (achieved through a complex intellectual struggle), he faced the world around him armed to do battle. He took on much conventional philosophical thinking among educated Russians, including the dry and abstract philosophizing of the German idealists and their Russian followers although maintaining the perspective of literary realism in his critical writings. In his words, “What is it to me that the Universal exists when the individual personality [&quot;lichnost’&quot;] is suffering.” Or: “The fate of the individual, of the person, is more important than the fate of the whole world.” Also upon this principle, Belinsky constructed an extensive critique of the world around him (especially the Russian one). He bitterly criticized autocracy and serfdom (as “trampling upon everything that is even remotely human and noble”) but also poverty, prostitution, drunkenness, bureaucratic coldness, and cruelty toward the less powerful (including women). 
Belinsky worked most of his short life as a literary critic. His writings on literature were inseparable from these moral judgments. Belinsky believed that the only realm of freedom in the repressive reign of Nicholas I was through the written word. What Belinsky required most of a work of literature was “truth.” This meant not only a probing portrayal of real life (he hated works of mere fantasy, or escape, or aestheticism), but also commitment to “true” ideas — the correct moral stance (above all this meant a concern for the dignity of individual people): As he told Nikolai Gogol (in a famous letter) the public “is always ready to forgive a writer for a bad book [i.e. aesthetically bad], but never for a pernicious one [ideologically and morally bad].” Belinsky viewed Gogol&#x27;s recent book, &quot;Correspondence with Friends&quot;, as pernicious because it renounced the need to “awaken in the people a sense of their human dignity, trampled down in the mud and the filth for so many centuries.”

Fyodor Dostoevsky read aloud at several public events Belinsky&#x27;s letter, which called for the end of serfdom. A secret press was assembled to print and distribute Belinsky&#x27;s letter. For these offenses Dostoevsky was arrested, convicted and condemned to death in 1849, a sentence later commuted to 4 years incarceration in the prison camps of Siberia.

In his role as perhaps the most influential liberal critic and ideologist of his day, Belinsky advocated literature that was socially conscious. He hailed Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Poor Folk&quot; (1845); however, Dostoevsky soon thereafter broke with Belinsky.

Inspired by these ideas, which led to thinking about radical changes in society&#x27;s organization, Belinsky began to call himself a socialist starting in 1841. 
Among his last great efforts were his move to join Nikolay Nekrasov in the popular magazine &quot;The Contemporary&quot; (&quot;Sovremennik&quot;), where the two critics established the new literary center of St. Petersburg and Russia. At that time Belinsky published his &quot;Literary Review for the Year 1847&quot;.

In 1848, shortly before his death, Belinsky granted full rights to Nikolay Nekrasov and his magazine, &quot;The Contemporary&quot; (&quot;Sovremennik&quot;), to publish various articles and other material originally planned for an almanac, to be called the Leviathan.

Belinsky died of consumption on the eve of his arrest by the Tsar&#x27;s police on account of his political views. In 1910, Russia celebrated the centenary of his birth with enthusiasm and appreciation.

His surname has variously been spelled &quot;Belinsky&quot; or &quot;Byelinski&quot;. His works, in twelve volumes, were first published in 1859–1862. Following the expiration of the copyright in 1898, several new editions appeared. The best of these is by S. Vengerov; it is supplied with profuse notes.

Belinsky early supported the work of Ivan Turgenev. The two became close friends and Turgenev fondly recalls Belinsky in his book &quot;Literary Reminiscences and Autobiographical Fragments&quot;. The British writer Isaiah Berlin has a chapter on Belinsky on his 1978 book &quot;Russian Thinkers&quot;. Here he points out some deficiencies of Belinsky&#x27;s critical insight:

He was wildly erratic, and all his enthusiasm and seriousness and integrity do not make up for lapses of insight or intellectual power. He declared that Dante was not a poet; that Fenimore Cooper was the equal of Shakespeare; that &quot;Othello&quot; was the product of a barbarous age...

But further on in the same essay, Berlin remarks:

Because he was naturally responsive to everything that was living and genuine, he transformed the concept of the critic&#x27;s calling in his native country. The lasting effect of his work was in altering and altering crucially and irretrievably, the moral and social outlook of the leading younger writers and thinkers of his time. He altered the quality and the tone both of the experience and of the expression of so much Russian thought and feeling that his role as a dominant social influence overshadows his attainments as a literary critic.
Berlin&#x27;s book introduced Belinsky to playwright Tom Stoppard, who included Belinsky as one of the principal characters in his trilogy of plays about Russian writers and activists: &quot;The Coast of Utopia&quot; (2002)

==Legacy==

<text>Trim () is a town in County Meath, Ireland. It is situated on the River Boyne and, as of the 2022 census, had a population of 9,563. The town is in a civil parish of the same name.

The town is noted for Trim Castle – the largest Norman castle in Ireland. One of the two cathedrals of the United Dioceses of Meath and Kildare – St Patrick&#x27;s cathedral – is located north of the river. Trim won the Irish Tidy Towns Competition in 1972, 1984, 2014 and 2022, and was the joint winner with Ballyconnell in 1974. Trim was historically the county town of Meath, but this title was passed on in 1898 to the larger, neighbouring town of Navan.

==History==
===Early history===
At an early date, a monastery was founded at Trim, which lay within the petty kingdom (&quot;tuath&quot;) of the Cenél Lóegairi. It is traditionally thought to have been founded by St. Patrick and left in the care of its patron saint Lommán, also locally known as Loman, who flourished sometime between the 5th and early 6th centuries. When domestic politics endangered the position of Lommán&#x27;s foundation, the church of Armagh assimilated Lommán into the dossier of St. Patrick, making him a disciple of that saint. Attackers burned the church several times in the twelfth century. The town was first captured by the English during the Norman invasion of Ireland and a castle was built. However, the town was recaptured and the castle burned by a massive Irish army under the command of Ruadhrí Ua Conchobair, King of Ireland. Later, it was refounded as an St. Mary&#x27;s Abbey under Augustinian rule. The abbey church was the sanctuary for &quot;Our Lady of Trim&quot;, a wooden statue reported to work miracles. The statue made Trim a major pilgrimage site from at least 1397. During the Reformation the statue was burned and Henry VIII dissolved the abbey. The abbey&#x27;s bell tower, the &quot;Yellow Steeple&quot;, is the primary remnant of St. Mary&#x27;s.

With the spelling &quot;Áth Truim&quot;, the bishopric is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see. Since it is not mentioned in either of the lists of the reduced number of sees approved by the Synod of Ráth Breasail (1111) and the Synod of Kells (1152), it was one of the monastic establishments that were no longer recognized as seats of bishops after the 12th-century reorganization of the Church in Ireland. Its territory was joined to that of Meath Diocese.

===Norman period===
Lying 61 m above sea level on the River Boyne, Trim became one of the most important Hiberno-Norman settlements in the Middle Ages. In the 15th century the Norman-Irish parliament met in Trim. Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington is reputed to have been born in Dangan Castle between Trim and Summerhill, and a large column to him was erected in the town in 1817. The town&#x27;s main feature is Ireland&#x27;s largest Norman castle, Trim Castle; other features include two ruined church complexes, the Boyne River for fishing, and the Butterstream Gardens, visited by Charles, Prince of Wales in the mid-nineties (no longer open to the public).
Trim Castle (or King John&#x27;s Castle) is Ireland&#x27;s largest Norman castle. It was built in the late 12th century following the Norman invasion of Ireland. Trim and the surrounding lands were granted to Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath, a Norman baron. Richard II of England stayed there before being ousted from power. Once a candidate to be the country&#x27;s capital, the town has also occupied a role as one of the outposts of the Pale, and sessions of the Irish Parliament were sometimes held here, as in 1542. It was also designated by Elizabeth I of England as the planned location for a Protestant Dublin University (known as Trinity College Dublin). However this was revised by Sir Francis Drake, who advocated the case for locating the university in Dublin.

===Later history===
In 1649 after the sacking of Drogheda, the garrison of Trim fled to join other Irish forces and the town was occupied by the army of Oliver Cromwell. There were many local disturbances in neighbouring villages in the Irish Rebellion of 1798, most infamously the battle on the Hill of Tara, following the dispersal of the Wexford rebellion. Trim was represented by Arthur Wellesley in the Irish Parliament from 1790 to 1797.

The 19th century saw the construction of Trim Courthouse, St. Loman&#x27;s Catholic church, St. Patrick&#x27;s Anglican church, the Wellington column, the current Bank of Ireland building, and Castle Street by Lord Dunsany, a major landowner. Following the Great Irish Famine of 1846–1849, the practices of agriculture in the hinterland altered, with a change in emphasis from tillage to stock raising. This resulted in a change in the business life of Trim. Trim developed as a market town for the productive agricultural hinterland. Some small-scale local industries were developed including envelope, and leather product manufacturing. Trim was also chosen as a location for the Timoney Engineering company to make Fire Tenders. However, in the main, the town continued to mainly be a service centre for its immediate area.

===20th century and contemporary===
During the Irish War of Independence, local companies of the Irish Republican Army took Trim RIC Barracks, a large structure located on the current site of the Castle Arch Hotel, secured the arms from the barracks and then burnt down the Barracks. A large part of the town was burned as a reprisal by the British Crown forces on 26 September 1920. The local members were drawn from Trim, Longwood, Ballivor and South Meath in general. The Lalor brothers from Castle St. were prominent members as well as the Duignans from High St and the Proctors. Records of the adventures of the Lalors rest in Navan library and recount the tales of one of the brothers hiding in the recently dug grave of Fr. Woods in the churchyard. Local memories recall the townspeople sheltering down by the Boyne for a few nights as the Black and Tans and the Auxiliaries burnt out several businesses and the town hall. Footage of the burning of J&amp;E Smyth can be viewed on the &#x27;Pathe&#x27; website. The newspapers reported the burning of the barracks and the subsequent looting and burning of the town and follow-up operations by the local IRA.

In later years, the Lalors who moved to the house across the road from the old Brothers school had a collection of memorabilia from those years including: letters from Collins sent from Frongoch (they kept the originals and forward duplicates to HQ), Éamon de Valera&#x27;s slippers and a Tricolour made by Constance Markievicz (with her name embroidered) that was to fly over the GPO during the 1916 Easter Rising. Their whereabouts now are unknown but photographs of their existence are on file in Navan library.

A new bridge was built on the Boyne in the 1980s to divert heavy traffic from the town. This was then enhanced by the construction, in stages, of an inner relief road, which now makes it possible for heavy traffic to achieve a complete by-pass of the town. The Watergate bridge was replaced in 2005.

As part of the Civil Service decentralization plan of the Irish government, Trim was chosen as the location of the headquarters for the state body known as the Office of Public Works. The movement of this state administration function to Trim resulted in Trim being the first location outside of Dublin to complete a decentralization move.

<text>The Brothers Creeggan was a Canadian alternative rock/jazz band composed of Jim Creeggan (upright bass, guitar, bass guitar, vocals), Andy Creeggan (guitar, piano, accordion, percussion, vocals) and Ian McLauchlan (drums). The group has released four albums: &quot;The Brothers Creeggan&quot; (1993), &quot;The Brothers Creeggan II&quot; (1997), &quot;Trunks&quot; (2000) and &quot;Sleepyhead&quot; (2002).

==Biography==
Growing up in Toronto, brothers Jim and Andy Creeggan started in music by recording cover songs of James Brown and George Thorogood on a rented 4-track. 
As teenagers, the pair performed in several groups, including the Synthetics, an a cappella quartet that won a 1987 Canadian talent contest in which Alanis Morissette was runner-up.
The brothers went on to become founding members of Barenaked Ladies. Andy left Barenaked Ladies in 1995 to pursue a musical composition degree at McGill University, while Jim continued as the band&#x27;s bassist.

The Brothers Creeggan released their self-titled debut album in 1993. The song &quot;Places&quot; features backing vocals by Alanis Morissette. 
The album &quot;was almost a demo thing,&quot; according to Andy. &quot;We finished it up and sent it to some friends.&quot; 
A second album, &quot;The Brothers Creeggan II&quot;, followed in 1997. Three years later, the duo added a third member, drummer Ian McLauchlan, and released their third album, &quot;Trunks&quot;. Andy said the album was &quot;definitely a natural evolution from the first two albums,&quot; as the songs on &quot;Trunks&quot; &quot;were more accessible and more continuous to each other.&quot; Jane Stevenson of Jam! called the album &quot;a delicate and sweet-sounding effort that combines the best of folk and jazz with gentle lead vocals from both Jim and Andy.&quot; 
Allmusic&#x27;s Theresa E. LaVeck described it as &quot;an extended evening lullaby: soft, sweet, and sleepy (think Simon &amp; Garfunkel lite).&quot;

The group&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Sleepyhead&quot;, was released on Nettwerk in 2002. Barenaked Ladies member Ed Robertson and singer-songwriter Sarah Harmer guest on album track &quot;Anna on the Moon&quot;. 
Tom Semioli of Allmusic said that with the album, &quot;the Brothers Creeggan have slipped a contemplative masterpiece into our midst.&quot;

The band went on hiatus in 2003. Jim stayed with the Barenaked Ladies; Andy went on to a solo career. On 13 July 2009, drummer Ian McLauchlan died of complications following heart surgery.

<text>International Thomson Organization (ITO) was a holding company, for interests in publishing, travel, and natural resources, that existed from 1978 to 1989. It was formed as a reorganization of the Thomson Organization, which had been founded by Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet (Lord Thomson of Fleet; 1894–1976) in 1959. It merged with Thomson Newspapers to become the Thomson Corporation in 1989.

ITO was formed in order to move the Thomson Organization&#x27;s operating base from Britain to Canada, so that it would not be subject to British monopolies legislation, foreign-exchange controls and dividend limitation. Under Roy Thomson&#x27;s son Kenneth Thomson, ITO sold its natural resources and continued expanding in publishing and media. In 1980, Thomson acquired Jane&#x27;s, an publishing company specializing in military intelligence. In 1981, it acquired the publishing operations of Litton Industries, including the &quot;Physicians&#x27; Desk Reference&quot;. By 1986, International Thomson had acquired business publisher Warren, Gorham &amp; Lamont; legal publishers Callaghan &amp; Company and Clark Boardman; and automotive publishers Ward&#x27;s. Other publishers acquired include Gale, Mitchell, and Thomson &amp; Thomson. In 1988, ITO acquired the British company Associated Book Publishers, which included Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Chapman &amp; Hall, The Law Book Company of Australasia, and Routledge. In 1989, ITO acquired Lawyers Cooperative Publishing, including subsidiaries Bancroft-Whitney and Research Institute of America.

<doc id="483107" wikidata="Q15317" url="?curid=483107" title="Helvetia">
<text>Helvetia () is a national personification of Switzerland, officially , the Swiss Confederation.

The allegory is typically pictured in a flowing clothing, with a spear and a shield emblazoned with the Swiss flag, and commonly with braided hair and a wreath as a symbol of confederation. The name is a derivation of the ethnonym , the name of the Gaulish tribe inhabiting the Swiss Plateau before the Roman conquest.

==History==
The fashion of depicting the Swiss Confederacy in terms of female allegories arose in the 17th century. This replaced an earlier convention, popular in the 1580s, of representing Switzerland as a bull ().

In the first half of the 17th century, no single allegory was identified as &quot;Helvetia&quot;. Rather, several allegories represented both virtues and vices of the confederacy. On the title page of his 1642 &quot;Topographia&quot;, Matthäus Merian depicted two allegorical figures seated below the title panel: one is the figure of an armed , representing Swiss military prowess and sovereignty, the other is a female &quot;Abundantia&quot; allegory crowned with a city&#x27;s ramparts.

Female allegories of individual cantons predate the single &quot;Helvetia&quot; figure. There are depictions of a &quot;Respublica Tigurina Virgo&quot; (1607), a &quot;Lucerna&quot; shown in 1658 with the victor of Villmergen, Christoph Pfyffer, and a &quot;Berna&quot; of 1682.

Over the next half-century, Merian&#x27;s &quot;Abundantia&quot; would develop into the figure of &quot;Helvetia&quot; proper. An oil painting of 1677/78 from Solothurn, known as , shows a female allegory standing on a pillar.
In 1672, an oil painting by Albrecht Kauw showed several figures labelled . These represent vices such as and , contrasting with the virtues of (not shown in the painting).

On 14 September 1672, a monumental baroque play by Johann Caspar Weissenbach was performed in Zug, entitled . 
The play is full of allegories illustrating the rise of &quot;Helvetia&quot; and her decadence after the Reformation. In the 4th act, the or &quot;Waning Helvetia&quot; is faced with and while the old virtues leave her. In the final scene, Christ appears to punish the wayward damsel, but the Mother of God and Bruder Klaus intercede, and the contrite sinner is pardoned.

Identification of the Swiss as &quot;Helvetians&quot; () becomes common in the 18th century, particularly in the French language, as in François-Joseph-Nicolas d&#x27;Alt de Tieffenthal&#x27;s very patriotic (1749–1753) followed by Alexander Ludwig von Wattenwyl&#x27;s (1754). Helvetia appears in patriotic and political artwork in the context of the construction of a national history and identity in the early 19th century, after the disintegration of the Napoleonic Helvetic Republic, and she appears on official federal coins and stamps from the foundation of Switzerland as a federal state in 1848.

==Name of Switzerland==

The Swiss Confederation continues to use the name in its Latin form when using any or all of its four official languages is inappropriate or inconvenient. Thus, the name appears on postage stamps, coins, and other uses; the full name, , is abbreviated for uses such as the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 and vehicle registration code CH, and the ccTLD, .ch.

Notably, translations of the term Helvetia still serve as the name for Switzerland in languages such as Irish, in which the country is known as , Greek, in which it is known as () and Romanian, in which it is known as . In Italian, is seen as archaic, but the demonym noun/adjective is used commonly as a synonym of . In French, Swiss people may be called . The German word is used as well as a synonym of and has a higher poetic value. is also more common in Germany; the German-speaking Swiss use or as poetic synonyms for their country.

<text>Ultrastructure (or ultra-structure) is the architecture of cells and biomaterials that is visible at higher magnifications than found on a standard optical light microscope. This traditionally meant the resolution and magnification range of a conventional transmission electron microscope (TEM) when viewing biological specimens such as cells, tissue, or organs. Ultrastructure can also be viewed with scanning electron microscopy and super-resolution microscopy, although TEM is a standard histology technique for viewing ultrastructure. Such cellular structures as organelles, which allow the cell to function properly within its specified environment, can be examined at the ultrastructural level.

Ultrastructure, along with molecular phylogeny, is a reliable phylogenetic way of classifying organisms. Features of ultrastructure are used industrially to control material properties and promote biocompatibility.

== History ==
In 1931, German engineers Max Knoll and Ernst Ruska invented the first electron microscope. With the development and invention of this microscope, the range of observable structures that were able to be explored and analyzed increased immensely, as biologists became progressively interested in the submicroscopic organization of cells. This new area of research concerned itself with substructure, also known as the ultrastructure.

== Applications ==
Many scientists use ultrastructural observations to study the following, including but not limited to:

*Human Tumors
*Chloroplasts
*Bone
*Platelets
*Sperm

== Biology ==
A common ultrastructural feature found in plant cells is the formation of calcium oxalate crystals. It has been theorized that these crystals function to store calcium within the cell until it is needed for growth or development.

Calcium oxalate crystals can also form in animals, and kidney stones are a form of these ultrastructural features. Theoretically, nanobacteria could be used to decrease the formation of calcium oxalate kidney stones.

== Engineering ==
Controlling ultrastructure has engineering uses for controlling the behavior of cells. Cells respond readily to changes in their extracellular matrix (ECM), so manufacturing materials to mimic ECM allows for increased control over the cell cycle and protein expression.

Many cells, such as plants, produce calcium oxalate crystals, and these crystals are usually considered ultrastructural components of plant cells. Calcium oxalate is a material that is used to manufacture ceramic glazes [6], and it also has biomaterial properties. For culturing cells and tissue engineering, this crystal is found in fetal bovine serum, and is an important aspect of the extracellular matrix for culturing cells. 

Ultrastructure is an important factor to consider when engineering dental implants. Since these devices interface directly with bone, their incorporation to surrounding tissue is necessary to optimal device function. It has been found that applying a load to a healing dental implant allows for increased osseointegration with facial bones. Analyzing the ultrastructure surrounding an implant is useful in determining how biocompatible it is and how the body reacts to it. One study found implanting granules of a biomaterial derived from pig bone caused the human body to incorporate the material into its ultrastructure and form new bone.

Hydroxyapatite is a biomaterial used to interface medical devices directly to bone by ultrastructure. Grafts can be created along with 𝛃-tricalcium phosphate, and it has been observed that surrounding bone tissue with incorporate the new material into its extracellular matrix. Hydroxyapatite is a highly biocompatible material, and its ultrastructural features, such as crystalline orientation, can be controlled carefully to ensure optimal biocompatibility. Proper crystal fiber orientation can make introduced minerals, like hydroxyapatite, more similar to the biological materials they intend to replace. Controlling ultrastructural features makes obtaining specific material properties possible.

<text>DirectPlay is part of Microsoft&#x27;s DirectX API. It is a network communication library intended for computer game development, although it can be used for other purposes.

DirectPlay is a high-level software interface between applications and communication services that allows games to be connected over the Internet, a modem link, or a network. It features a set of tools that allow players to find game sessions and sites to manage the flow of information between hosts and players. It provides a way for applications to communicate with each other, regardless of the underlying online service or protocol. It also resolves many connectivity issues, such as Network Address Translation (NAT).

Like the rest of DirectX, DirectPlay runs in COM and is accessed through component object model (COM) interfaces. By default, DirectPlay uses multi-threaded programming techniques and requires careful thought to avoid the usual threading issues. Since DirectX version 9, this issue can be alleviated at the expense of efficiency.

==Networking==
DirectPlay is built on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to allow it speedy communication with other DirectPlay applications. It uses TCP and UDP ports 2300 to 2400 and 47624.
==Interfaces==
*The primary interfaces (methods of access) for DirectPlay are:
**IDirectPlay8Server, which allows access to server functionality
**IDirectPlay8Client, which allows access to client functionality
**IDirectPlay8Peer, which allows access to peer-to-peer functionality
*Secondary interfaces are:
** Various lobby interfaces that allows players to find and prepare a game before it actually commences.
** Thread management interfaces that allows the programmer to fine-tune resource usage. This also allows for a general disabling of worker threads so that tricky multi-threaded issues are avoided at the cost of decreased responsiveness.
** Various network address translation (NAT) interfaces that make it easier for players behind routers to host games. Most players on broadband internet connections face this problem.
** Various voice communication interfaces known as &quot;DirectPlay Voice&quot; that make it easier to support audio communication and voice input in games.
** Various queue monitoring interfaces that allow the application to get feedback on how much data has been sent and received as requested. This allows an application to decrease/increase the amount of data sent in accordance with the capabilities of the receiver.

==DirectPlay Voice==
DirectPlay Voice was introduced in Windows Me as part of DirectX 7.1 for multiplayer games. It is a voice communications, recording and playback API that allows gamers to use voice chat in games written to take advantage of the API, through a DirectPlay network transport session itself.

==Current status==
DirectPlay was traditionally one of the components of DirectX that received less attention, but for DirectX version 8 it received a major overhaul and became a relatively lightweight networking library. However, as part of Microsoft&#x27;s unveiling of XNA in 2004, Microsoft announced that DirectPlay would be deprecated in favor of Games for Windows - Live technology already available on Xbox and being ported for use on Windows PCs. DirectPlay was supported in DirectX DLLs for the lifetime of Microsoft Windows XP. However, starting from the autumn of 2007, the headers and libraries — vital components if developers wanted to develop new programs utilizing the technology — were removed from the DirectX SDK. 

In Windows Vista, DirectPlay has been deprecated and DirectPlay Voice and DirectPlay&#x27;s NAT Helper have been removed. In Windows 10, DirectPlay is fully deprecated, and modern game development has transitioned to more current technologies like Xbox Live and other networking APIs.

<doc id="483112" wikidata="Q477958" url="?curid=483112" title="February 26 incident">
<text>The was an attempted &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in the Empire of Japan on 26 February 1936. It was organized by a group of young Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) officers with the goal of purging the government and military leadership of their factional rivals and ideological opponents.

Although the rebels succeeded in assassinating several leading officials (including two former prime ministers) and in occupying the government center of Tokyo, they failed to assassinate Prime Minister Keisuke Okada or secure control of the Imperial Palace. Their supporters in the army made attempts to capitalize on their actions, but divisions within the military, combined with Imperial anger at the coup, meant they were unable to achieve a change of government. Facing overwhelming opposition as the army moved against them, the rebels surrendered on 29 February.

Unlike earlier examples of political violence by young officers, the coup attempt had severe consequences. After a series of closed trials, nineteen of the uprising&#x27;s leaders were executed for mutiny and another forty were imprisoned. The radical Kōdōha faction lost its influence within the army, while the military, now free from infighting, increased its control over the civilian government, which had been severely weakened by the assassination of key moderate and liberal-minded leaders.

==Background==
===Army factional rivalry===

The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) had a long history of factionalism among its high-ranking officers, originally stemming from domainal rivalries in the Meiji period. By the early 1930s, officers in the high command had become split into two main informal groups: the Kōdō-ha &quot;Imperial Way&quot; faction led by General Sadao Araki and his ally General Jinzaburō Mazaki, and the Tōseiha &quot;Control&quot; faction identified with General Tetsuzan Nagata.

The Kōdō-ha emphasized the importance of Japanese culture, spiritual purity over material quality, and the need to attack the Soviet Union (&quot;Hokushin-ron&quot;), while the Tōsei-ha officers, who were strongly influenced by the ideas of the contemporary German general staff, supported central economic and military planning (total war theory), technological modernization, mechanization and expansion within China (&quot;Nanshin-ron&quot;). The Kōdō-ha was dominant in the IJA during Araki&#x27;s tenure as Minister of War from 1931 to 1934, occupying most significant staff positions, but many of its members were replaced by Tōsei-ha officers following Araki&#x27;s resignation.

===The &quot;young officers&quot;===
IJA officers were divided between those whose education had ended at the Army Academy (an undergraduate academy) and those who had advanced on to the prestigious Army War College (a graduate school for midlevel officers). The latter group formed the elite of the officer corps, while officers of the former group were effectively barred by tradition from advancement to higher-level staff positions. A number of these lesser-privileged officers formed the army&#x27;s contribution to the young, highly politicized group often referred to as the .

The young officers believed that the problems facing the nation were the result of Japan straying from the (an amorphous term often translated as &quot;national polity&quot;, it roughly signifies the relationship between the Emperor and the state). To them, the &quot;privileged classes&quot; exploited the people, leading to widespread poverty in rural areas, and deceived the Emperor, usurping his power and weakening Japan. The solution, they believed, was a &quot;Shōwa Restoration&quot; modeled on the Meiji Restoration of 70 years earlier. By rising up and destroying the &quot;evil advisers around the Throne&quot;, the officers would enable the Emperor to re-establish his authority. The Emperor would then purge those who exploited the people, restoring prosperity to the nation. These beliefs were strongly influenced by contemporary nationalist thought, especially the political philosophy of the former socialist Ikki Kita. Almost all of the young officers&#x27; subordinates were from poor peasant family or working class, and believed that the young officers truly understood their predicaments and spirits.

The loose-knit young officers group varied in size, but is estimated to have had roughly 100 regular members, mostly officers in the Tokyo area. Its informal leader was Mitsugi (Zei) Nishida. A former IJA lieutenant and disciple of Kita, Nishida had become a prominent member of the civilian nationalist societies that proliferated in Japan from the late 1920s. He referred to the army group as the faction. Involved at least to some extent in most of the political violence of the period, following the March and October incidents of 1931, the army and navy members of the group split and largely ended their association with civilian nationalists.

Despite its relatively small size, the Kokutai Genri-ha faction was influential, due in no small part to the threat it posed. It had sympathizers among the general staff and the Imperial Family, most notably Prince Chichibu, the Emperor&#x27;s brother (and, until 1933, his heir), who was friends with Nishida and other Kokutai Genri-ha leaders. Despite being fiercely anti-capitalist, the faction had also managed to secure irregular funding from &quot;zaibatsu&quot; leaders who hoped to shield themselves.

The exact nature of the relationship between the Kōdō-ha and the Kokutai Genri-ha was complicated, with historians treating the two factions either as the same entity or as two groups forming a larger whole. However, contemporary accounts and the writings of members of the two groups make clear they were actually distinct groups in a mutually beneficial alliance. The Kōdō-ha shielded the Kokutai Genri-ha and provided it with access, while they in exchange benefited from their perceived ability to restrain the radical officers.

===Political violence===
The years leading up to the February 26 Incident were marked by a series of violent outbursts by the young officers and their fellow nationalists against political opponents. Most notable was the May 15 Incident of 1932, in which young naval officers assassinated Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi. This incident is significant because it convinced the young army officers (who were aware of, but not involved in, the attack) of the need to utilize troops in any potential coup attempt. The ringleaders of the incident, as in the previous March and October incidents, received relatively light punishments.

The direct prelude to the February 26 Incident, however, was the 1934 Military Academy Incident (November Incident) and its consequences. In this incident, Captain Takaji Muranaka and Captain Asaichi Isobe, prominent members of the Kokutai Genri-ha, were arrested for planning a coup with a group of military cadets. Muranaka and Isobe admitted discussing such a coup, but denied having any plans to actually carry it out. The military court investigating the incident found there was insufficient evidence to indict, but Muranaka and Isobe were suspended by the army. The two were convinced that the incident was a Tōsei-ha attack on the young officers and began circulating a pamphlet calling for a &quot;housecleaning&quot; of the IJA and naming Tetsuzan Nagata as the &quot;chief villain&quot;. They were then expelled from the IJA.

It was at this time that the last Kōdō-ha officer in a prominent position, General Jinzaburō Mazaki, was forced out of office. The insidious and cantankerous Mazaki was generally disliked by his colleagues and his removal was not purely political but the young officers were enraged because, having become disillusioned with Araki for his failures to overcome resistance in the cabinet during his time as War Minister, Mazaki had become the focus of their hopes. Muranaka and Isobe released a new pamphlet attacking Nagata for the dismissal, as did Nishida.

On 12 August 1935, in the Aizawa Incident, Lieutenant-Colonel Saburō Aizawa, a member of the Kokutai Genri-ha and a friend of Mazaki, murdered Nagata in his office in retaliation. Aizawa&#x27;s public trial, which began in late January 1936, became a media sensation, as Aizawa and the Kokutai Genri-ha leadership, in collusion with the judges, turned it into a soapbox from which their ideology could be broadcast. Aizawa&#x27;s supporters in the mass media praised his &quot;morality and patriotism&quot;, and Aizawa himself came to be seen as &quot;a simple soldier who sought only to reform the army and the nation according to the true National Principle.&quot;

== Preparations ==
=== Deciding to act ===
The Kokutai Genri-ha had long supported a violent uprising against the government. The decision to finally act in February 1936 was caused by two factors. The first was the decision announced in December 1935 to transfer the 1st Division, to which most of the Kokutai Genri-ha&#x27;s officers belonged, to Manchuria in the spring. This meant that if the officers did not strike before then, any possible action would be delayed by years. The second was Aizawa&#x27;s trial. The impact of his actions had impressed the officers, and they believed that by acting while his trial was still in progress, they could take advantage of the favorable public opinion it was engendering.

The decision to act was initially opposed by Nishida and Kita when they learned of it. The pair&#x27;s relationship with most of the officers had become relatively distant in the years leading up to the uprising, and they were against direct action. However, once it was clear that the officers were determined to act anyway, they moved to support them. Another barrier to be overcome was opposition to the involvement of troops from Teruzō Andō, who had sworn an oath to his commander not to involve his men in any direct action. Andō&#x27;s position in the 3rd Infantry Regiment (the largest source of troops) was essential to the plot, so Muranaka and Nonaka spoke with him repeatedly, ultimately wearing down his resistance.

February 26 was chosen because the officers had been able to arrange to have themselves and their allies serve as duty officers on that date, facilitating their access to arms and ammunition. The date also allowed Mazaki to testify at Aizawa&#x27;s trial as scheduled on the 25th.

=== Planning and manifesto ===
The uprising was planned in a series of meetings held between 18 and 22 February by Nishida, Yasuhide Kurihara, Teruzō Andō, Hisashi Kōno, Takaji Muranaka and Asaichi Isobe. The plan decided upon was relatively simple. The officers would assassinate the most prominent enemies of the &quot;kokutai&quot;, secure control of the administrative center of the capital and the Imperial Palace, then submit their demands (the dismissal of certain officers and the appointment of a new cabinet led by Mazaki). They had no longer-term goals, believing that those should be left to the Emperor. It is believed that they were prepared to replace Hirohito with Prince Chichibu if necessary, however.

The young officers believed they had at least tacit approval for their uprising from a number of important IJA officers after making a number of informal approaches. These included Araki, Minister of War Yoshiyuki Kawashima, Jinzaburō Mazaki, Tomoyuki Yamashita, Kanji Ishiwara, Shigeru Honjō and their own immediate commanders, Kōhei Kashii and Takeo Hori. Kawashima&#x27;s successor as Minister of War later remarked that if all the officers who had supported the rebels had been forced to resign, there wouldn&#x27;t have been enough high-ranking officers left to replace them.

The young officers prepared an explanation of their intentions and grievances in a document entitled , which they wanted to be handed to the Emperor. The document was prepared by Muranaka, but written in Shirō Nonaka&#x27;s name as he was the highest-ranking officer involved in the plot. The document was entirely in line with Kokutai Genri-ha ideals, blaming the &quot;genrō&quot;, political leaders, military factions, &quot;zaibatsu&quot;, bureaucrats and political parties for endangering the &quot;kokutai&quot; through their selfishness and disrespect for the Emperor and asserting the need for direct action:&lt;br&gt;

Seven targets were chosen for assassination for &quot;threatening the kokutai&quot;:

The first four mentioned in the above list survived the attempted coup. Saionji, Saitō, Suzuki and Makino were targeted because they were the most influential Imperial advisers. Okada and Takahashi were moderate political leaders who had worked to restrain the military. Finally, Watanabe was targeted as a member of the Tōsei-ha and because he had been involved with Mazaki&#x27;s removal.

Saionji&#x27;s name was ultimately removed from the list, though the reasons why are disputed. Some of the officers&#x27; allies argued that he should be left alive to be used to help convince the Emperor to appoint Mazaki as prime minister, and this is commonly given as the reason. However, Isobe testified later that he had rejected these suggestions and continued to make arrangements for the attack on Saionji. According to his account, the attack was only canceled after the officers assigned to carry it out (teachers at a military school in Toyohashi, Aichi Prefecture) could not agree over the use of cadets in the operation.

===The Righteous Army===

From 22 February on, the seven leaders managed to convince eighteen other officers to join the uprising with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Non-commissioned officers (NCOs) were informed on the night of 25 February, hours before the attacks started. Although the officers insisted that all NCOs participated voluntarily and any orders given were merely &quot;pro forma&quot;, many of the NCOs argued later that they had been in no real position to refuse to participate. The soldiers themselves, 70% of whom were less than a month out of basic training, were not told anything before the coup began, though many were (according to the officers) enthusiastic once the uprising began.

The bulk of the Righteous Army was made up of men from the 1st Division&#x27;s 1st Infantry Regiment (11th and MG companies; 456 men) and 3rd Infantry Regiment (1st, 3rd, 6th, 7th, 10th, and MG companies; 937 men). The only other significant contribution was 138 men from the 3rd Imperial Guard Regiment. Including officers, civilians and men from other units, the total size of the Righteous Army was 1,558 men. An official count of 1,483 was given at the time; this number excludes the 75 men who participated in Nakahashi&#x27;s attempt to secure the Imperial Palace (see below).

The coup leaders adopted the name for this force and the password , adopted from the Meiji Restoration-era slogan, &quot;Revere the Emperor, Destroy the Shogunate&quot;. Allies were also to display a three-sen postage stamp when approaching the army&#x27;s lines.

==Uprising==

The night of 25 February brought heavy snowfall to Tokyo. This heartened the rebel officers because it reminded them of the 1860 Sakuradamon Incident in which &quot;shishi&quot; (political activists with ambitions) assassinated Ii Naosuke, the chief adviser to the Shōgun, in the name of the Emperor.

The rebel troops, divided into six groups, assembled their troops and left their barracks between 03:30 and 04:00. The attacks on Okada, Takahashi, Suzuki, Saito, the Ministry of War and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police headquarters occurred simultaneously at 05:00.

===1st Infantry Regiment===
====Okada Keisuke====

The attack on Okada consisted of 280 men from the 1st Infantry Regiment led by 1st Lieutenant Yasuhide Kurihara.

The troops surrounded the Prime Minister&#x27;s Residence and forced its guards to open the gates. Upon entering the compound and attempting to find the prime minister, however, they were fired upon by four policemen. All four were killed after wounding six of the rebel soldiers, but the gunfire succeeded in warning Okada of the danger. He was taken into hiding by his brother-in-law, Colonel Denzō Matsuo. Matsuo, who was said to have resembled Okada, was then discovered and killed by the troops. The soldiers compared Matsuo&#x27;s wounded face to a picture of the prime minister and concluded that they had succeeded in their mission. Okada escaped the next day, but this fact was kept a secret and he played no further role in the incident. After Matsuo&#x27;s death, Kurihara&#x27;s men assumed guard positions around the compound. They were joined by sixty men from the 3rd Imperial Guard (see below).

====Seizure of the Ministry of War====
Captain Kiyosada Kōda, accompanied by Muranaka, Isobe, and others, led 160 men to seize control of the Minister of War&#x27;s residence, the Ministry of War itself and the General Staff Office. Once this had been accomplished, they entered the residence and asked to see Minister Kawashima. When they were admitted to see him at 06:30, they read their manifesto aloud and handed him a document in which they made numerous demands of the army, including:

* The rapid resolution of the situation by Kawashima in a way that &quot;advanced the cause of the Restoration&quot;
* The prevention of the use of force against the Righteous Army
* The arrest of Kazushige Ugaki (Governor-General of Korea), Jirō Minami (commander of the Kwantung Army), Kuniaki Koiso (commander of the Korean Army), and Yoshitsugu Tatekawa for being &quot;the source of the destruction of military command&quot;.
* The immediate dismissal of Lieutenant Colonel Akira Mutō, Colonel Hiroshi Nemoto, and Major Tadashi Katakura from the Imperial Japanese Army for promoting &quot;factionalism&quot;
* The appointment of Araki as the new commander of the Kwantung Army.

As Minister of War (1924–27, 1929–31), Ugaki had overseen a reduction in size and modernization of the army. He had also failed to back the March Incident plotters (who had hoped to make him prime minister). Minami, Muto, Nemoto and Katakura were all prominent members of the Tōsei-ha faction. Katakura was also partly responsible for reporting the Military Academy Incident. When Isobe encountered him outside the Ministry of War later that morning, he shot him (non-fatally) in the head.

During this period, a number of officers sympathetic to the rebels were admitted, including General Mazaki, General Tomoyuki Yamashita, General Ryū Saitō and the Vice-Minister of War, Motoo Furushō. Saitō praised the young officers&#x27; spirit and urged Kawashima to accept their demands. Shortly before 09:00, Kawashima stated that he needed to speak with the Emperor and left for the Imperial Palace.

====Makino Nobuaki====
Captain Hisashi Kōno commanded a team consisting of seven members, including six civilians, to attack Makino, who was staying at Kōfūsō, part of the ryokan Itōya in Yugawara, Kanagawa Prefecture, with his family. Arriving at 05:45, they stationed two men outside, then entered the inn with weapons drawn, at which point policemen stationed inside opened fire, beginning a lengthy gunfight. A policeman notified Makino and his party of the attack and led them to a rear entrance. The assassins fired upon the group as they left, but did not realize that Makino had managed to escape. Kōno was wounded in the chest during the gunfire and one policeman, Yoshitaka Minagawa, was killed. As Kōno was carried from the fighting, the assassins set fire to the building. Hearing a single shot, Kōno believed Makino had shot himself inside the burning building. The men took Kōno to a nearby military hospital where all were arrested by military police.

====Attack on the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot;====
At approximately 10:00, Kurihara and Nakahashi boarded three trucks with sixty men and traveled from the Prime Minister&#x27;s Residence to the offices of the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot;, a prominent liberal newspaper. Charging into the building, the officers forced the newspaper employees to evacuate while yelling that the attack was &quot;divine retribution for being an un-Japanese newspaper&quot;. They then overturned and scattered the newspaper&#x27;s type trays (containing 4,000 different characters) on the floor, temporarily preventing the newspaper from publishing. Following the attack the men distributed copies of the uprising&#x27;s manifesto to nearby newspapers and returned to the Prime Minister&#x27;s Residence.

===3rd Imperial Guard===
====Takahashi Korekiyo====

1st Lieutenant Motoaki Nakahashi of the 3rd Imperial Guard assembled 135 men and, telling his commanders that they were going to pay their respects at Yasukuni Shrine (or Meiji Jingū; sources differ), marched to Takahashi&#x27;s personal residence. There he split his men in half and took one group to attack the residence while having the other stand guard outside. After the men smashed their way into the compound, confused servants led Nakahashi and Lieutenant Kanji Nakajima to Takahashi&#x27;s bedroom. There, Nakahashi shot the sleeping Takahashi with his pistol while Nakajima slashed him with his sword. Takahashi died without waking.

Once Takahashi was dead, Nakahashi sent the group that had participated in the attack to join the troops already at the Prime Minister&#x27;s Residence. He then accompanied the remaining group of men onward to the Imperial Palace.

====Attempt to secure the Imperial Palace====
Nakahashi and his 75 men entered the palace grounds using the western Hanzō Gate at 06:00. Nakahashi&#x27;s unit was the scheduled , and he told the commander of the palace guard, Major Kentarō Honma, that he had been dispatched to reinforce the gates because of the attacks earlier that morning. Honma had been informed of the attacks, so he found Nakahashi&#x27;s arrival unsurprising. Nakahashi was assigned to help secure the Sakashita Gate, the main entrance to the grounds directly in front of the Kyūden (the Emperor&#x27;s residence).

Nakahashi&#x27;s plan had been to secure the Sakashita Gate, then use flashlights to signal the nearby rebel troops at police headquarters to join him. Having gained control over access to the Emperor, the rebels would then be able to prevent anyone but Honjō and others they approved of from seeing him. Nakahashi had difficulty contacting his allies, however, and by 08:00 Honma had learned of his involvement in the uprising. Nakahashi was ordered at gunpoint to leave the palace grounds. He did so, joining Kurihara at the Prime Minister&#x27;s Residence. His soldiers remained at the gate until they were relieved at 13:00, at which point they returned to their barracks. For this reason, these 75 soldiers were not included in the government&#x27;s official tally of rebel forces.

===3rd Infantry Regiment===
====Saitō Makoto====
1st Lieutenant Naoshi Sakai led 120 men from the 3rd Infantry Regiment to Saitō&#x27;s private residence in Yotsuya. A group of the soldiers surrounded the policemen on guard, who surrendered. Five men, including Sakai, entered the residence and found Saitō and his wife Haruko on the second floor in their bedroom. They shot Saitō, who fell to the ground dead. His wife covered him with her body and told the soldiers, &quot;Please kill me instead!&quot; They pulled her off and continued to fire at Saitō. Haruko was wounded by a stray bullet. Following Saitō&#x27;s death, two officers led a group of men to attack General Watanabe. The rest left to assume a position northeast of the Ministry of War.

====Kantarō Suzuki====
Captain Teruzō Andō led 200 men of the 3rd Infantry Regiment to Suzuki&#x27;s private residence just across from the Imperial Palace in Kōjimachi. They surrounded and disarmed the police on guard, then a group entered the building. After Suzuki was discovered in his bedroom, he was shot twice (sources differ as to who fired the shots). Andō then moved to deliver a &quot;coup de grace&quot; with his sword, when Suzuki&#x27;s wife pleaded to be allowed to do it herself. Believing Suzuki to be mortally wounded, Andō agreed. He apologized to her, explaining that it was done for the sake of the nation. He then ordered his men to salute Suzuki and they left to guard the Miyakezaka junction north of the Ministry of War. Suzuki, although seriously wounded, would survive.
Andō had visited Suzuki at his home in 1934 to suggest that Araki be appointed prime minister following Saitō&#x27;s resignation. Suzuki had rejected the suggestion, but Andō had come away with a favorable impression of Suzuki.

====Watanabe Jōtarō====

Following the attack on Saitō, twenty men led by 2nd Lieutenant Tarō Takahashi and 2nd Lieutenant Yutaka Yasuda boarded two trucks and headed to Watanabe&#x27;s residence in Ogikubo, on the outskirts of Tokyo, arriving shortly after 07:00. Despite the two hours that had passed since the other attacks, no attempt had been made to warn Watanabe.

As the men attempted to enter the front of the residence, they were fired upon by military police stationed inside. Yasuda and another soldier were wounded. The soldiers then forced their way in through the rear entrance, where they encountered Watanabe&#x27;s wife standing outside their bedroom on the second floor. Shoving her aside, they found Watanabe using a futon for cover. Watanabe opened fire with his pistol, whereupon one of the soldiers fired a burst at him with a light machine gun. Takahashi then rushed forward and stabbed Watanabe with his sword. Watanabe&#x27;s nine-year-old daughter, Kazuko, witnessed his death as she hid behind a table nearby. The soldiers then boarded their trucks and left, taking their two wounded to a hospital, then assuming a position in northern Nagatachō.

====Tokyo Metropolitan Police headquarters====

Captain Shirō Nonaka took nearly a third of all the rebels&#x27; troops, 500 men from the 3rd Infantry Regiment, to attack the headquarters of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police, located directly south of the Imperial Palace, with the goal of securing its communication equipment and preventing the dispatch of the police&#x27;s . They met no resistance and soon secured the building, possibly due to a police decision to leave the situation in the hands of the army. Nonaka&#x27;s group was as large as it was because they were intended to move on to the palace itself.

After the occupation of the police headquarters, 2nd Lieutenant Kinjirō Suzuki led a small group to attack the nearby residence of Fumio Gotō, the Home Minister. Gotō was not home, however, and escaped the attack. This attack appears to have been the result of an independent decision by Suzuki rather than part of the officers&#x27; overall plan, however.

==Government response and suppression of the uprising==
===Opposition of the Court faction and Emperor===
The Imperial Palace learned of the uprising when Captain Ichitarō Yamaguchi, a supporter of rebel officers and duty officer for the 1st Infantry Regiment, informed his father-in-law, General Shigeru Honjō, the Emperor&#x27;s chief aide-de-camp and member of the Kōdō-ha, at about 05:00. Honjō then contacted his subordinates and the chief of the military police and headed to the palace. The Emperor himself learned of the incident at 05:40 and met with Honjō shortly after 06:00. He told Honjō to end the incident, although he was not specific as to how.

With Saitō dead and Suzuki gravely wounded, the Emperor&#x27;s chief remaining advisors were Kōichi Kido, Chief Secretary to the Lord Keeper; Kurahei Yuasa, Minister of the Imperial Household; and Vice-Grand Chamberlain Tadataka Hirohata. These officials met after learning of the attacks from Suzuki&#x27;s secretary. They took a hard line, advising the Emperor that he should demand that efforts be concentrated on suppressing the uprising and that he must not accept the resignation of the current government, as doing so would &quot;effectively be granting victory to the rebel army&quot;. It was after hearing this advice that Hirohito hardened his position.
Kawashima met with the Emperor at 09:30 after his meeting with the rebel officers at the Ministry of War. He read the officers&#x27; manifesto and demands aloud and then recommended the Emperor form a new cabinet to &quot;clarify the &quot;kokutai&quot;, stabilize national life, and fulfill national defense.&quot; The Emperor refused and demanded that Kawashima suppress the uprising. When the remaining members of Okada&#x27;s government, unaware that he was alive, attempted to resign that afternoon, Hirohito told them he would not allow it until the uprising had been suppressed.

===The Minister of War&#x27;s proclamation and &quot;de facto&quot; recognition===
The Supreme Military Council (SMC) held an unofficial meeting in the afternoon, attended by a number of other officers including Kashii, Yamashita, Kawashima and Hajime Sugiyama, Vice Chief of Staff. The SMC, while a prestigious part of the IJA, had little function in peacetime and had therefore become a body to which high-ranking officers could be appointed without actually granting them power. For this reason, by 1936 a number of Kōdō-ha generals, including Araki and Mazaki, had been made members.

The authority of this meeting was disputed; it had not been convened by the Emperor, and Sugiyama argued that it had no authority. Araki countered that the &quot;elders of the army&quot; had a moral obligation to resolve the situation. The Kōdō-ha members and their supporters controlled a clear majority of the council.

Despite the Emperor&#x27;s order to Kawashima that the uprising be suppressed, Araki proposed that a message be drafted to the rebels. This message, which came to be known as the &quot;Minister of War&#x27;s Proclamation&quot;, has become a point of controversy (it was issued in Kawashima&#x27;s name because of the unofficial nature of the SMC meeting). Araki and other participants argued later that it had been intended to persuade the officers to surrender. Others interpreted it as an endorsement of the uprising.

The proclamation read:
#The purpose of your actions has been reported to His Majesty.
#We recognize that your motives are based on a sincere desire to clarify the national polity.
#The current state of the national polity (including its defilement) is a matter of great regret to us.
#All the Supreme War Councilors have agreed to unite and move forward in accordance with the principles stated above.
#Beyond this everything depends upon His Majesty&#x27;s will.
Once approved, Yamashita brought the message to the rebels in the Ministry of War, who were pleased but somewhat confused by its vagueness. Some of the officers later testified that Yamashita claimed that the Emperor had approved the message, but Yamashita denied this.

Another point of controversy was the proclamation&#x27;s wording. Although the above text notes that the rebels&#x27; &quot;motives&quot; were recognized, another version of the text was distributed by Kashii (possibly at Kawashima&#x27;s instructions) shortly after 15:30 to military units in Tokyo. This version recognized the rebels&#x27; &quot;actions&quot; rather than their &quot;motives&quot;. This difference has been attributed to Kōdō-ha manipulation of the text after-the-fact. Araki, Yamashita and others claimed that what Kashii distributed was an earlier, unfinished draft of the proclamation.
Two other developments deepened the rebel officers&#x27; impression that their uprising had succeeded. At 15:00, shortly before the Minister of War&#x27;s message was released, Kashii, acting as commander of the Tokyo garrison, ordered a state of in the 1st Division&#x27;s operational area (which included the area being occupied by the rebel troops). This had the effect of formally placing the rebel troops within the chain of command under Lieutenant General Takeo Hori&#x27;s 3rd Infantry Regiment. Hori placed them under Colonel Satoshi Kofuji and charged them with maintaining law and order in their area. Thus, the rebel officers were no longer acting illegally by occupying their positions. As with the earlier Minister of War&#x27;s Proclamation, this order was later justified as an attempt to convince the rebel officers to end their occupation. The officers were, however, encouraged by the act and convinced that they were on the verge of success.

The second positive development was the declaration of martial law. The cabinet initially opposed this measure, as it feared it would be used to impose military rule (just as the young officers hoped), but they had no choice but to approve it after Kawashima insisted it was necessary to resolve the uprising. The Privy Council concurred, and the edict was signed by the Emperor at 01:20 on the 27th. Kashii was made chief of Martial Law Headquarters. In his first order, issued later that morning, he ordered the rebel troops to enforce martial law in the Kōjimachi area (which they were occupying.)

===Opposition within the military===
Despite the above developments, the position of the Righteous Army was less secure than it seemed. Most significantly, as noted above, the Emperor and his court officials had taken a hard line towards the uprising. In addition, the rebels also faced important opposition within the military as well, especially from the Army General Staff and navy. Many within the army were pleased by the assassinations because they had removed a number of the army&#x27;s opponents within the government. However, they could not accept the more radical social ideas included within a &quot;Shōwa Restoration&quot; and were not disposed to accept a Kōdō-ha-dominated cabinet. Others, such as Kanji Ishiwara, were infuriated at the rebel officers&#x27; use of troops without authorization.

The General Staff was effectively ruled by a triumvirate made up of the Chief of Staff, Vice Chief of Staff and Inspector General of Military Education. With Watanabe assassinated and the Chief of Staff (Prince Kan&#x27;in) ill and away from the capital, Vice Chief of Staff Sugiyama had full control. Sugiyama, a member of the Tōsei-ha, had from the beginning favored the forcible removal of the rebel occupation of the capital. His unwillingness to accept a new cabinet and present a united front with the SMC to the Emperor would ultimately be a major factor in the uprising&#x27;s collapse. Initially concerned about the uncertainty of the situation, however, he only called in reinforcements from outside Tokyo.
The Naval Staff had taken a similarly dim view of the uprising, at least partly due to the attacks on three admirals (Okada, Saitō and Suzuki). It summoned the 1st Fleet to Tokyo on 26 February. By the afternoon of 27 February forty warships were stationed in Tokyo Bay and the navy&#x27;s land forces (&quot;rikusentai&quot;) had been dispatched to defend naval installations in the city.

===Negotiations and stalemate===
Thus, by the evening of 26 February, the uprising had resulted in a stalemate. The Emperor and Sugiyama&#x27;s opposition had prevented the achievement of its primary goal: the appointment of a military-dominated cabinet centered around Mazaki. Although the Righteous Army had managed to achieve a degree of official recognition for their actions, it was obvious that they could not occupy their positions indefinitely. Their presence was their strongest bargaining chip, but even their supporters felt that it needed to end.

It was for this reason that Araki, Mazaki and most of the other members of the SMC met with Muranaka and Kurihara at the Ministry of War on the night of 26 February. There they congratulated the officers again, but asked that they return to their units and leave the rest to the SMC. The rebel officers refused, correctly pointing out that it was only because they had fully armed troops behind them the generals were prepared to listen, and again spoke of the need to promote the Shōwa Restoration and form a &quot;strong cabinet centered around the military&quot;. No agreement was reached.

This approach was followed by late-night negotiations at the Imperial Hotel between Ishiwara and Lieutenant Colonel Sakichi Mitsui, a supporter of the uprising. They reached a compromise: a new cabinet under Admiral Eisuke Yamamoto would be appointed and the rebel troops would return to their units. This compromise was rejected by both Sugiyama (who insisted the Emperor would not approve a new cabinet) and the rebel officers (who would only accept a Mazaki cabinet).

Finally a settlement seemed to have been reached when the rebel officers asked to see Mazaki on 27 February. Mazaki, accompanied by two other members of the SMC (Nobuyuki Abe and Yoshikazu Nishi), arrived at the Ministry of War at 16:00. Gathered there were all the rebel officers except Andō and Kurihara, who were in charge of the troops outside, and Kōno, who was still hospitalized. The rebels told Mazaki that they were entrusting everything to him. Mazaki thanked them, but explained that he could do nothing until they returned to their units. He also stated that he would fight them himself if they went against the Emperor&#x27;s wishes. The rebels replied that if they received a formal order to return, they would of course obey it. Following the meeting, both Mazaki and the rebel officers were relieved. Mazaki believed the rebel officers would leave without violence and the rebels were apparently convinced that a Mazaki cabinet would be formed shortly after they did so. Kashii issued orders for the troops to stay the night in the buildings they had occupied and reported to the Emperor that the situation would be resolved by the morning.

===The imperial command===
However, unknown to Kashii, Mazaki and the rebel officers, Sugiyama had already asked the Emperor at 08:20 to issue an imperial command authorizing the use of force against the Righteous Army. This was immediately granted and issued to Sugiyama, to be released at his discretion. Addressed to Kashii, the command ordered him to quickly evict &quot;the officers and men occupying the Miyakezaka area&quot;.
The Emperor had, by the end of 27 February, become increasingly impatient with the failure of the Army to suppress the uprising as he had ordered on the previous day. The Navy&#x27;s quick response satisfied him but the Army&#x27;s hesitation was inexplicable to the Emperor. He summoned Honjō throughout the day, demanding to know if the rebels had been suppressed. When Honjō spoke in defense of the officers&#x27; motives, the Emperor angrily replied &quot;killing my ministers is tantamount to strangling me with cotton wool&quot; and added that the rebels deserved no leniency. At one point, Hirohito became so impatient he threatened to assume personal command of the Imperial Guard and order them to attack the rebels himself.

The General Staff and Martial Law Headquarters decided to release the imperial command at 05:00 on the 28th. From this point on formal documents, which had previously used &quot;uprising&quot;, the word chosen by the rebel officers themselves, began to use the word instead.

At 08:00 the rebel officers&#x27; nominal superior, Major Kofuji, was told to inform the officers of the imperial command and order them to return to their units. However, Muranaka and Kōda had already heard of the command from Nakahashi. Believing the order to be a mistake, they went to see him. When they met Kofuji, he only told them to come to 1st Division Headquarters. There they met General Hori, who lied to them, telling them that no command had been issued. The relieved but skeptical officers left.

A meeting of the heads of the army – including Kawashima, Kashii and Sugiyama – had been held from the early morning onward (Araki and Mazaki had attempted to attend but had been told to leave, as the SMC had no authority). Kawashima and Kashii attempted to convince the group to avoid violence, but when 10:00 passed without any word of movement by the rebel officers, they approved the use of force. However, when Hori and Kofuji came to see Kashii at 10:40, the three agreed that it was too early to enact the imperial command. It has also been suggested that a lack of preparedness on the part of government forces was another factor. Either way, the action was delayed.

Yamashita visited the Ministry of War at 12:00 and told the rebel officers that the issuance of the imperial command was merely a matter of time and that they should &quot;take responsibility&quot;. Hori joined the group at 12:30 and confirmed Yamashita&#x27;s words. Shortly after, Kurihara, speaking for the group, asked that an Imperial messenger be sent. He said that the officers would commit suicide and the NCOs would take the soldiers back to their barracks. Yamashita, joined by Kawashima, immediately went to the Imperial Palace, where he informed Honjō of the officers&#x27; request for the Imperial Command for their suicide, perceived to be the only honourable way out for them. Honjō, thinking this was a good solution for all parties concerned, asked his majesty that the request be granted, but to his surprise, the Emperor flatly refused. His fury was such that he blurted &quot;If they want to die, do as they wish. Do it on their own. An Imperial Command is out of question&quot;.

Not all the rebels had been prepared to commit suicide. Andō had been infuriated at the idea, yelling that &quot;the generals want to use us as footstools and have us kill ourselves&quot;. His rejection of the idea and the Emperor&#x27;s refusal led to a change of heart among the officers. By 13:30 they had decided to fight. Kofuji learned this at 14:00, when he finally attempted to gather the officers to read them the imperial command and they refused to return to their units (the orders had to be formally given in order to be valid). Soon after, at 16:00, Martial Law Headquarters announced that force would be used and the rebel troops were removed from Kofuji&#x27;s command at 18:00. At 23:00 orders went out to begin preparations at 05:00 on 29 February for a general attack.

===Final hours===

By the morning of 29 February, the Righteous Army, consisting of less than 1,500, was surrounded by more than 20,000 loyal government troops and 22 tanks. The general attack was planned for 09:00. By 05:30 all civilians in the surrounding areas had been evacuated.

From 08:00 the IJA began a major propaganda push towards the rebel troops. Three planes scattered leaflets from the air, a giant ad balloon adorned with the words, &quot;The Imperial Command has been issued, do not resist the Army colors!&quot; was suspended nearby and a series of radio broadcasts were made over NHK. The broadcasts and leaflets assured soldiers it was not too late to return to their units and informed them of the imperial command. (The broadcasts would cause later problems, for they had promised all crimes would be forgiven.) These efforts, together with the hopeless odds, had a devastating effect. Desertions began shortly after midnight; by 10:00, many of the troops were gone.

Realizing the hopelessness, by noon all the officers except Andō had released their soldiers. Finally, at 13:00, Andō ordered his men to leave and unsuccessfully attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head. The rest assembled at the Ministry of War. There they met Yamashita and Ishiwara, who suggested that they commit suicide. They allowed the men to keep their sidearms and left. Colonel Nobutoki Ide, a member of the General Staff and Nonaka&#x27;s former commander, came to the building and called for Nonaka to come outside. Shortly afterwards, Nonaka shot himself. Isobe claimed that Nonaka was forced to commit suicide in an attempt to pressure the rest of the officers to do the same. The final rebel officer to commit suicide was Kōno, still hospitalized from the failed attack on Makino, who stabbed himself with a knife a week later. The remaining officers were arrested by military police at 18:00. They were all stripped of their rank.

==Aftermath==

===Trials===
The Emperor signed an ordinance on March 4, 1936, establishing a to try those involved in the uprising. All 1,483 members of the Righteous Army were interrogated, but ultimately only 124 were prosecuted: nineteen officers, 73 NCOs, nineteen soldiers and ten civilians. Of these, all of the officers, 43 NCOs, three soldiers and all of the civilians were found guilty. The trials related to the uprising took nearly eighteen months to complete.

The main trial of the ringleaders of the rebellion (the nineteen surviving officers, Isobe, Muranaka and two other civilians) began on 28 April. The trial was held in secret, and the defendants did not have rights to legal representation, call witnesses or appeal. The judges were not interested in hearing about the defendants&#x27; motives and intentions, and forced them to concentrate on their actions in their testimony. The trial was therefore far different from the ordinary court martial that Aizawa had faced a few months earlier. Charged with , the rebel officers argued that their actions had been approved by the Minister of War&#x27;s Proclamation and their incorporation into the martial law forces, and that they had never been formally presented with the imperial command. The verdicts were handed down on 4 June and the sentences on 5 July: all were found guilty and seventeen were sentenced to death.

Four more trials took place for those directly involved in the attacks: one for those NCOs involved in the attacks on Saitō, Watanabe and Tokyo police headquarters; one for those NCOs involved in the attacks on Okada, Takahashi, Suzuki and the Ministry of War; one for the soldiers involved in those attacks; one for the NCO and six civilians involved in the attack on Makino. A series of trials were also held for 37 men charged with indirectly supporting the rebellion. Twenty-four were found guilty, with punishments ranging from life imprisonment to a fine of JP¥45. The most noteworthy of these were Ichitarō Yamaguchi (life imprisonment), Ryu Saitō (five years) and Sakichi Mitsui (three years).

Kita and Nishida were also charged as ringleaders of the rebellion and tried in a separate trial. Their actions during the uprising had only been indirect (primarily providing support over the telephone) and as such they did not actually meet the requirements of the charge. The chief judge, Major-General Isao Yoshida, protested to the Ministry of War that the charges were improper. However, the Tōsei-ha generals now dominant in the IJA had decided that the two men&#x27;s influence had to be eliminated; Yoshida later wrote another judge to tell him that regardless of the lack of evidence, it had been decided that the two must die. They were sentenced to death on 14 August 1937.

The only significant military figure to be tried for involvement in the uprising was Mazaki, charged with collaborating with the rebel officers. Although his own testimony showed him to be guilty of the charge, he was found not guilty on 25 September 1937. This has been attributed to the influence of Fumimaro Konoe, who had become prime minister in June.

Fifteen of the officers were executed by firing squad on 15 July at a military prison in Shibuya. The execution of Muranaka and Isobe was delayed so that they could testify at Kita and Nishida&#x27;s trial. Muranaka, Isobe, Kita and Nishida were executed by firing squad at the same location on 14 August 1937.

===Change of government===
Despite the failure of the coup, the February 26 Incident had the effect of significantly increasing the military&#x27;s influence over the civilian government. The Okada cabinet resigned on 9 March and a new cabinet was formed by Kōki Hirota, Okada&#x27;s foreign minister. This transition was not without its problems, however. When the selection of Hirota was made clear and efforts began to assemble a cabinet, General Hisaichi Terauchi, the new cabinet&#x27;s Minister of War, made his displeasure with some of the selections clear. Hirota gave in to Terauchi&#x27;s demands and changed his selections, choosing Hachirō Arita over Shigeru Yoshida as Minister of Foreign Affairs.

This interference with cabinet selection was followed by a demand that only active-duty officers be allowed to serve as Minister of War and Minister of the Navy. Until this point reserve and retired officers had been allowed to serve in these positions. This demand was accepted and authorized by imperial commands on 18 May. This change would have far-reaching implications for the Japanese government, as it effectively gave veto power over government policies to the military services. By asking a minister to resign and refusing to appoint a new officer to serve as his replacement, the services could cause a government to fall at their pleasure. This fate would, in fact, meet Hirota less than a year later when Terauchi resigned over Hirota&#x27;s refusal to dissolve the Diet.

===Personnel changes within the Army===
Although only Mazaki faced criminal charges, this didn&#x27;t mean that the Kōdō-ha didn&#x27;t suffer any consequences from the incident. Under Terauchi&#x27;s auspices, , most notably Ishiwara and Akira Mutō, began a purge of the military. Of the twelve full generals in the army, nine were removed from active service by the end of April, including Kōdō-ha members Araki, Mazaki, Kawashima and Honjō. At the same time, other Kōdō-ha officers and their supporters were either removed from active service or sent to positions away from the capital, where they would be less able to influence policy. Among these were Yamashita, Kashii, Kofuji, Hori, Hashimoto and Yanagawa. Although other, non-Kōdō-ha officers were also targeted to a limited extent, the focus of the actions was clearly on eliminating Kōdō-ha influence. Almost every high-ranking officer who had helped support the Righteous Army during the uprising was therefore affected.

==Commemoration==

The parents, widows, and children of the executed rebels, who were prevented by the government from commemorating them until the end of the Second World War, formed the . They have established two sites in Tokyo commemorating the officers of the February 26 Incident. In 1952, shortly after the end of the Allied occupation of Japan, they placed a gravestone entitled in Kensōji, a temple in Azabu-Jūban, where the ashes of the executed men had been placed. The &quot;twenty-two&quot; signifies the nineteen men executed, the two who committed suicide (Nonaka and Kōno) and Aizawa. Then, in 1965, they placed a statue of Kannon, the Buddhist goddess of mercy, dedicated to the memories of the rebel officers and their victims at the former location of the Shibuya execution grounds.

<text>In marketing, customer lifetime value (CLV or often CLTV), lifetime customer value (LCV), or life-time value (LTV) is a prognostication of the net profit 
contributed to the whole future relationship with a customer. The prediction model can have varying levels of sophistication and accuracy, ranging from a crude heuristic to the use of complex predictive analytics techniques.
Customer lifetime value can also be defined as the monetary value of a customer relationship, based on the present value of the projected future cash flows from the customer relationship. Customer lifetime value is an important concept in that it encourages firms to shift their focus from quarterly profits to the long-term health of their customer relationships. Customer lifetime value is an important metric because it represents an upper limit on spending to acquire new customers. For this reason it is an important element in calculating payback of advertising spent in marketing mix modeling.

One of the first accounts of the term &quot;customer lifetime value&quot; is in the 1988 book &quot;Database Marketing&quot;, which includes detailed worked examples. Early adopters of customer lifetime value models in the 1990s include Edge Consulting and BrandScience.

==Purpose==

The purpose of the customer lifetime value metric is to assess the financial value of each customer. Don Peppers and Martha Rogers are quoted as saying, &quot;some customers are more equal than others.&quot; Customer lifetime value differs from customer profitability or CP (the difference between the revenues and the costs associated with the customer relationship during a specified period) in that CP measures the past and CLV looks forward. As such, CLV can be more useful in shaping managers’ decisions but is much more difficult to quantify. While quantifying CP is a matter of carefully reporting and summarizing the results of past activity, quantifying CLV involves forecasting future activity.

:Customer lifetime value: 
:&quot;The present value of the future cash flows attributed to the customer during his/her entire relationship with the company.&quot;

Present value is the discounted sum of future cash flows: each future cash flow is multiplied by a carefully selected number less than one, before being added together. The multiplication factor accounts for the way the value of money is discounted over time. The time-based value of money captures the intuition that everyone would prefer to get paid sooner rather than later but would prefer to pay later rather than sooner. The multiplication factors depend on the discount rate chosen (10% per year as an example) and the length of time before each cash flow occurs. For example, money received ten years from now must be discounted more than money received five years in the future.

CLV applies the concept of present value to cash flows attributed to the customer relationship. Because the present value of any stream of future cash flows is designed to measure the single lump sum value today of the future stream of cash flows, CLV will represent the single lump sum value today of the customer relationship. Even more simply, CLV is the monetary value of the customer relationship to the firm. It is an upper limit on what the firm would be willing to pay to acquire the customer relationship as well as an upper limit on the amount the firm would be willing to pay to avoid losing the customer relationship. If a customer relationship is viewed as an asset of the firm, CLV would present the monetary value of that asset.

One of the major uses of CLV is customer segmentation, which starts with the understanding that not all customers are equally important. CLV-based segmentation model allows the company to predict the most profitable group of customers, understand those customers&#x27; common characteristics, and focus more on them rather than on less profitable customers. CLV-based segmentation can be combined with a share of wallet (SOW) model to identify &quot;high CLV but low SOW&quot; customers with the assumption that the company&#x27;s profit could be maximized by investing marketing resources in those customers.

Customer lifetime value metrics are used mainly in relationship-focused businesses, especially those with customer contracts. Examples include banking and insurance services, telecommunications and most of the business-to-business sector. However, the CLV principles may be extended to transactions-focused categories such as consumer packaged goods by incorporating stochastic purchase models of individual or aggregate behavior. In either case, retention has a decisive impact on CLV, since low retention rates result in customer lifetime value barely increasing over time.

==Construction==

When margins and retention rates are constant, the following formula can be used to calculate the lifetime value of a customer relationship:

:formula_1

The model for customer cash flows treats the firm&#x27;s customer relationships as something of a leaky bucket. Each period, a fraction (1 less the retention rate) of the firm&#x27;s customers leave and are lost for good.

The CLV model has only three parameters: (1) constant margin (contribution after deducting variable costs including retention spending) per period, (2) constant retention probability per period, and (3) discount rate. Furthermore, the model assumes that in the event that the customer is not retained, they are lost for good. Finally, the model assumes that the first margin will be received (with probability equal to the retention rate) at the end of the first period.

The one other assumption of the model is that the firm uses an infinite horizon when it calculates the present value of future cash flows. Although no firm actually has an infinite horizon, the consequences of assuming one are discussed in the following.

Under the assumptions of the model, CLV is a multiple of the margin. The multiplicative factor represents the present value of the expected length (number of periods) of the customer relationship. When retention equals 0, the customer will never be retained, and the multiplicative factor is zero. When retention equals 1, the customer is always retained, and the firm receives the margin in perpetuity. The present value of the margin in perpetuity turns out to be the Margin divided by the Discount Rate. For retention values in between, the CLV formula tells us the appropriate multiplier.

==Methodology==

Simple commerce example

(Avg Monthly Revenue per Customer * Gross Margin per Customer) ÷ Monthly Churn Rate

The numerator represents the average monthly profit per customer, and dividing by the churn rate sums the geometric series representing the chance the customer will still be around in future months. 

For example:
$100 avg monthly spend * 25% margin ÷ 5% monthly churn = $500 LTV

A retention example

CLV (customer lifetime value) calculation process consists of four steps:
# forecasting of remaining customer lifetime (most often in years)
# forecasting of future revenues (most often year-by-year), based on estimation about future products purchased and price paid
# estimation of costs for delivering those products
# calculation of the net present value of these future amounts

Forecasting accuracy and difficulty in tracking customers over time may affect CLV calculation process.

Retention models make several simplifying assumptions and often involve the following inputs:

* Churn rate, the percentage of customers who end their relationship with a company in a given period. Churn rate + retention rate = 100%. Most models can be written using either churn rate or retention rate. If the model uses only one churn rate, the assumption is that the churn rate is constant across the life of the customer relationship.
* Discount rate, the cost of capital used to discount future revenue from a customer. Discounting is an advanced topic that is frequently ignored in customer lifetime value calculations. The current interest rate is sometimes used as a simple (but incorrect) proxy for discount rate.
* Contribution margin
* Retention cost, the amount of money a company has to spend in a given period to retain an existing customer. Retention costs include customer support, billing, promotional incentives, etc.
* Period, the unit of time into which a customer relationship is divided for analysis. A year is the most commonly used period. Customer lifetime value is a multi-period calculation, usually stretching 3–7 years into the future. In practice, analysis beyond this point is viewed as too speculative to be reliable. The number of periods used in the calculation is sometimes referred to as the model horizon.

Thus, one of the ways to calculate CLV, where period is a year, is as follows:

:formula_2

where formula_3 is yearly gross contribution per customer, formula_4 is the (relevant) retention costs per customer per year (this formula assumes the retention activities are paid for each mid year and they only affect those who were retained in the previous year), formula_5 is the horizon (in years), formula_6 is the yearly retention rate, formula_7 is the yearly discount rate. In addition to retention costs, firms are likely to invest in cross-selling activities which are designed to increase the yearly profit of a customer over time.

Simplified models

It is often helpful to estimate customer lifetime value with a simple model to make initial assessments of customer segments and targeting. If formula_3 is found to be relatively fixed across periods, CLV can be expressed as a simpler model assuming an infinite economic life (i.e., formula_9 ) :

:formula_10

Note: No CLV methodology has been independently audited by the Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) according to MMAP (Marketing Metric Audit Protocol).

== Uses and advantages ==

Customer lifetime value has intuitive appeal as a marketing concept, because in theory it represents exactly how much each customer is worth in monetary terms, and therefore exactly how much a marketing department should be willing to spend to acquire each customer, especially in direct response marketing.

Lifetime value is typically used to judge the appropriateness of the costs of acquisition of a customer. For example, if a new customer costs $50 to acquire (COCA, or cost of customer acquisition), and their lifetime value is $60, then the customer is judged to be profitable, and acquisition of additional similar customers is acceptable.

Additionally, CLV is used to calculate customer equity.

Advantages of CLV:
* management of customer relationship as an asset
* monitoring the impact of management strategies and marketing investments on the value of customer assets, e.g.: marketing mix modeling simulators can use a multi-year CLV model to show the true value (versus acquisition cost) of an additional customer, reduced churn rate, product up-sell
* determination of the optimal level of investments in marketing and sales activities
* encourages marketers to focus on the long-term value of customers instead of investing resources in acquiring &quot;cheap&quot; customers with low total revenue value
* implementation of sensitivity analysis in order to determinate getting impact by spending extra money on each customer
* optimal allocation of limited resources for ongoing marketing activities in order to achieve a maximum return
* a good basis for selecting customers and for decision making regarding customer specific communication strategies 
* a natural decision criterion to use in automation of customer relationship management systems 
* measurement of customer loyalty (proportion of purchase, probability of purchase and repurchase, purchase frequency and sequence etc.)

The disadvantages of CLV do not generally stem from CLV modeling per se, but from its incorrect application.

==Misuses and downsides==
===NPV vs. nominal prediction===
The most accurate CLV predictions are made using the net present value (NPV) of each future net profit source, so that the revenue to be received from the customer in the future is recognized at the future value of money. However, NPV calculations require additional sophistication including maintenance of a discount rate, which leads most organizations to instead calculate CLV using the nominal (non-discounted) figures. Nominal CLV predictions are biased slightly high, scaling higher the farther into the future the revenues are expected from customers.

===Net profit vs. revenue===
A common mistake is for a CLV prediction to calculate the total revenue or even gross margin associated with a customer. However, this can cause CLV to be multiples of their actual value, and instead need to be calculated as the full net profit expected from the customer.

Often ecommerce reporting systems will report lifetime revenue (LTR), rather than lifetime value based on net profit, due to the difficulty most ecommerce platforms have generating an accurate profit figure (i.e. calculating accurate sold item costs, marketing costs and delivery costs) on an order by order basis. Lifetime revenue can still be a very valuable and useful metric for ecommerce stores to report on in order to measure site performance.

===Segment inaccuracy===
Opponents often cite the inaccuracy of a CLV prediction to argue they should not be used to drive significant business decisions. For example, major drivers to the value of a customer such as the nature of the relationship are often not available as appropriately structured data and thus not included in the formula.

===Comparison with intuition===
More predictors, such as specific demographics of a customer group, may have an effect that is intuitively obvious to an experienced marketer but are often omitted from CLV predictions and thus cause inaccuracies in certain customer segments.

===Over-values current customers at the expense of potential customers===
The biggest problem with how many CLV models are actually used is that they tend to deny the very idea that marketing works (i.e., that marketing will change customer behavior). Low-value customers can be turned into high-value customers by effective marketing. Many CLV models use incorrect mathematics in that they do not take account of the value of a far greater number of middle-value customers, over-prioritizing a smaller number of high value customers. Additionally, these high-value customers may be saturated (i.e., not have the ability to buy any more products), may be the most expensive group to serve, and may be the most expensive group to reach by communication. The use of survey data is a viable way to collect information on potential customers.

===CLV is a dynamic concept, not a static model===
A customer lifetime value is the output of a model, not an input. If the model inputs change (e.g., marketing is effective and retention rates increase), the average CLV will increase. However, when engaging with customers in such way which cause detraction, the opposite may happen and average CLV will go down (e.g. the invoicing department sends them the wrong or unclear invoices).

<doc id="483120" wikidata="Q10564851" url="?curid=483120" title="Closure operator">
<text>In mathematics, a closure operator on a set &quot;S&quot; is a function formula_1 from the power set of &quot;S&quot; to itself that satisfies the following conditions for all sets formula_2

Closure operators are determined by their closed sets, i.e., by the sets of the form cl(&quot;X&quot;), since the closure cl(&quot;X&quot;) of a set &quot;X&quot; is the smallest closed set containing &quot;X&quot;. Such families of &quot;closed sets&quot; are sometimes called closure systems or &quot;Moore families&quot;. A set together with a closure operator on it is sometimes called a closure space. Closure operators are also called &quot;hull operators&quot;, which prevents confusion with the &quot;closure operators&quot; studied in topology. 

== History ==
E. H. Moore studied closure operators in his 1910 &quot;Introduction to a form of general analysis&quot;, whereas the concept of the closure of a subset originated in the work of Frigyes Riesz in connection with topological spaces. Though not formalized at the time, the idea of closure originated in the late 19th century with notable contributions by Ernst Schröder, Richard Dedekind and Georg Cantor.

== Examples ==

The usual set closure from topology is a closure operator. Other examples include the linear span of a subset of a vector space, the convex hull or affine hull of a subset of a vector space or the lower semicontinuous hull formula_3 of a function formula_4, where formula_5 is e.g. a normed space, defined implicitly formula_6, where formula_7 is the epigraph of a function formula_8.

The relative interior formula_9 is not a closure operator: although it is idempotent, it is not increasing and if formula_10 is a cube in formula_11 and formula_12 is one of its faces, then formula_13, but formula_14 and formula_15, so it is not increasing.

In topology, the closure operators are &quot;topological&quot; closure operators, which must satisfy

: formula_16

for all formula_17 (Note that for formula_18 this gives formula_19).

In algebra and logic, many closure operators are finitary closure operators, i.e. they satisfy

: formula_20

In the theory of partially ordered sets, which are important in theoretical computer science, closure operators have a more general definition that replaces formula_21 with formula_22. (See .)

== Closure operators in topology ==

The topological closure of a subset &quot;X&quot; of a topological space consists of all points &quot;y&quot; of the space, such that every neighbourhood of &quot;y&quot; contains a point of &quot;X&quot;. The function that associates to every subset &quot;X&quot; its closure is a topological closure operator. Conversely, every topological closure operator on a set gives rise to a topological space whose closed sets are exactly the closed sets with respect to the closure operator.

== Closure operators in algebra ==
Finitary closure operators play a relatively prominent role in universal algebra, and in this context they are traditionally called &quot;algebraic closure operators&quot;. Every subset of an algebra &quot;generates&quot; a subalgebra: the smallest subalgebra containing the set. This gives rise to a finitary closure operator.

Perhaps the best known example for this is the function that associates to every subset of a given vector space its linear span. Similarly, the function that associates to every subset of a given group the subgroup generated by it, and similarly for fields and all other types of algebraic structures.

The linear span in a vector space and the similar algebraic closure in a field both satisfy the &quot;exchange property:&quot; If &quot;x&quot; is in the closure of the union of &quot;A&quot; and {&quot;y&quot;} but not in the closure of &quot;A&quot;, then &quot;y&quot; is in the closure of the union of &quot;A&quot; and {&quot;x&quot;}. A finitary closure operator with this property is called a matroid. The dimension of a vector space, or the transcendence degree of a field (over its prime field) is exactly the rank of the corresponding matroid.

The function that maps every subset of a given field to its algebraic closure is also a finitary closure operator, and in general it is different from the operator mentioned before. Finitary closure operators that generalize these two operators are studied in model theory as dcl (for &quot;definable closure&quot;) and acl (for &quot;algebraic closure&quot;).

The convex hull in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space is another example of a finitary closure operator. It satisfies the &quot;anti-exchange property:&quot; If &quot;x&quot; is in the closure of the union of {&quot;y&quot;} and &quot;A&quot;, but not in the union of {&quot;y&quot;} and closure of &quot;A&quot;, then &quot;y&quot; is not in the closure of the union of {&quot;x&quot;} and &quot;A&quot;. Finitary closure operators with this property give rise to antimatroids.

As another example of a closure operator used in algebra, if some algebra has universe &quot;A&quot; and &quot;X&quot; is a set of pairs of &quot;A&quot;, then the operator assigning to &quot;X&quot; the smallest congruence containing &quot;X&quot; is a finitary closure operator on &quot;A x A&quot;.

== Closure operators in logic ==
Suppose you have some logical formalism that contains certain rules allowing you to derive new formulas from given ones. Consider the set &quot;F&quot; of all possible formulas, and let &quot;P&quot; be the power set of &quot;F&quot;, ordered by ⊆. For a set &quot;X&quot; of formulas, let cl(&quot;X&quot;) be the set of all formulas that can be derived from &quot;X&quot;. Then cl is a closure operator on &quot;P&quot;. More precisely, we can obtain cl as follows. Call &quot;continuous&quot; an operator &quot;J&quot; such that, for every directed class &quot;T&quot;,
:&quot;J&quot;(lim &quot;T&quot;) = lim &quot;J&quot;(&quot;T&quot;). 

This continuity condition is on the basis of a fixed point theorem for &quot;J&quot;. Consider the one-step operator &quot;J&quot; of a monotone logic. This is the operator associating any set &quot;X&quot; of formulas with the set &quot;J&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) of formulas that are either logical axioms or are obtained by an inference rule from formulas in &quot;X&quot; or are in &quot;X&quot;. Then such an operator is continuous and we can define cl(&quot;X&quot;) as the least fixed point for &quot;J&quot; greater or equal to &quot;X&quot;. In accordance with such a point of view, Tarski, Brown, Suszko and other authors proposed a general approach to logic based on closure operator theory. Also, such an idea is proposed in programming logic (see Lloyd 1987) and in fuzzy logic (see Gerla 2000).

=== Consequence operators ===
Around 1930, Alfred Tarski developed an abstract theory of logical deductions that models some properties of logical calculi. Mathematically, what he described is just a finitary closure operator on a set (the set of &quot;sentences&quot;). In abstract algebraic logic, finitary closure operators are still studied under the name &quot;consequence operator&quot;, which was coined by Tarski. The set &quot;S&quot; represents a set of sentences, a subset &quot;T&quot; of &quot;S&quot; a theory, and cl(&quot;T&quot;) is the set of all sentences that follow from the theory. Nowadays the term can refer to closure operators that need not be finitary; finitary closure operators are then sometimes called finite consequence operators.

== Closed sets ==
The closed sets with respect to a closure operator on &quot;S&quot; form a subset &quot;C&quot; of the power set P(&quot;S&quot;). Any intersection of sets in &quot;C&quot; is again in &quot;C&quot;. In other words, &quot;C&quot; is a complete meet-subsemilattice of P(&quot;S&quot;). Conversely, if &quot;C&quot; ⊆ P(&quot;S&quot;) is closed under arbitrary intersections, then the function that associates to every subset &quot;X&quot; of &quot;S&quot; the smallest set &quot;Y&quot; ∈ &quot;C&quot; such that &quot;X&quot; ⊆ &quot;Y&quot; is a closure operator.

There is a simple and fast algorithm for generating all closed sets of a given closure operator.

A closure operator on a set is topological if and only if the set of closed sets is closed under finite unions, i.e., &quot;C&quot; is a meet-complete sublattice of P(&quot;S&quot;). Even for non-topological closure operators, &quot;C&quot; can be seen as having the structure of a lattice. (The join of two sets &quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot; ⊆ P(&quot;S&quot;) being cl(&quot;X&quot; formula_23 &quot;Y&quot;).) But then &quot;C&quot; is not a sublattice of the lattice P(&quot;S&quot;).

Given a finitary closure operator on a set, the closures of finite sets are exactly the compact elements of the set &quot;C&quot; of closed sets. It follows that &quot;C&quot; is an algebraic poset.
Since &quot;C&quot; is also a lattice, it is often referred to as an algebraic lattice in this context. Conversely, if &quot;C&quot; is an algebraic poset, then the closure operator is finitary.

=== Pseudo-closed sets ===
Each closure operator on a finite set &quot;S&quot; is uniquely determined by its images of its &quot;pseudo-closed&quot; sets.
These are recursively defined: A set is pseudo-closed if it is not closed and contains the closure of each of its pseudo-closed proper subsets. Formally: &quot;P&quot; ⊆ &quot;S&quot; is pseudo-closed if and only if
* &quot;P&quot; ≠ cl(&quot;P&quot;) and 
* if &quot;Q&quot; ⊂ &quot;P&quot; is pseudo-closed, then cl(&quot;Q&quot;) ⊆ &quot;P&quot;.

== Closure operators on partially ordered sets ==
A partially ordered set (poset) is a set together with a &quot;partial order&quot; ≤, i.e. a binary relation that is reflexive (), transitive ( implies ) and antisymmetric ( implies &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot;). Every power set P(&quot;S&quot;) together with inclusion ⊆ is a partially ordered set.

A function cl: &quot;P&quot; → &quot;P&quot; from a partial order &quot;P&quot; to itself is called a closure operator if it satisfies the following axioms for all elements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; in &quot;P&quot;.

More succinct alternatives are available: the definition above is equivalent to the single axiom

:&quot;x&quot; ≤ cl(&quot;y&quot;) if and only if cl(&quot;x&quot;) ≤ cl(&quot;y&quot;)

for all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; in &quot;P&quot;.

Using the pointwise order on functions between posets, one may alternatively write the extensiveness property as id&quot;P&quot; ≤ cl, where id is the identity function. A self-map &quot;k&quot; that is increasing and idempotent, but satisfies the dual of the extensiveness property, i.e. &quot;k&quot; ≤ id&quot;P&quot; is called a kernel operator, interior operator, or dual closure. As examples, if &quot;A&quot; is a subset of a set &quot;B&quot;, then the self-map on the powerset of &quot;B&quot; given by &quot;μA&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) = &quot;A&quot; ∪ &quot;X&quot; is a closure operator, whereas &quot;λA&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) = &quot;A&quot; ∩ &quot;X&quot; is a kernel operator. The ceiling function from the real numbers to the real numbers, which assigns to every real &quot;x&quot; the smallest integer not smaller than &quot;x&quot;, is another example of a closure operator.

A fixpoint of the function cl, i.e. an element &quot;c&quot; of &quot;P&quot; that satisfies cl(&quot;c&quot;) = &quot;c&quot;, is called a closed element. A closure operator on a partially ordered set is determined by its closed elements. If &quot;c&quot; is a closed element, then &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;c&quot; and cl(&quot;x&quot;) ≤ &quot;c&quot; are equivalent conditions.

Every Galois connection (or residuated mapping) gives rise to a closure operator (as is explained in that article). In fact, &quot;every&quot; closure operator arises in this way from a suitable Galois connection. The Galois connection is not uniquely determined by the closure operator. One Galois connection that gives rise to the closure operator cl can be described as follows: if &quot;A&quot; is the set of closed elements with respect to cl, then cl: &quot;P&quot; → &quot;A&quot; is the lower adjoint of a Galois connection between &quot;P&quot; and &quot;A&quot;, with the upper adjoint being the embedding of &quot;A&quot; into &quot;P&quot;. Furthermore, every lower adjoint of an embedding of some subset into &quot;P&quot; is a closure operator. &quot;Closure operators are lower adjoints of embeddings.&quot; Note however that not every embedding has a lower adjoint.

Any partially ordered set &quot;P&quot; can be viewed as a category, with a single morphism from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot; if and only if &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot;. The closure operators on the partially ordered set &quot;P&quot; are then nothing but the monads on the category &quot;P&quot;. Equivalently, a closure operator can be viewed as an endofunctor on the category of partially ordered sets that has the additional &quot;idempotent&quot; and &quot;extensive&quot; properties.

If &quot;P&quot; is a complete lattice, then a subset &quot;A&quot; of &quot;P&quot; is the set of closed elements for some closure operator on &quot;P&quot; if and only if &quot;A&quot; is a Moore family on &quot;P&quot;, i.e. the largest element of &quot;P&quot; is in &quot;A&quot;, and the infimum (meet) of any non-empty subset of &quot;A&quot; is again in &quot;A&quot;. Any such set &quot;A&quot; is itself a complete lattice with the order inherited from &quot;P&quot; (but the supremum (join) operation might differ from that of &quot;P&quot;). When &quot;P&quot; is the powerset Boolean algebra of a set &quot;X&quot;, then a Moore family on &quot;P&quot; is called a closure system on &quot;X&quot;.

The closure operators on &quot;P&quot; form themselves a complete lattice; the order on closure operators is defined by cl1 ≤ cl2 iff cl1(&quot;x&quot;) ≤ cl2(&quot;x&quot;) for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;P&quot;.

<text>GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP) is a free library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic, operating on signed integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers. There are no practical limits to the precision except the ones implied by the available memory (operands may be of up to 232−1 bits on 32-bit machines and 237 bits on 64-bit machines). GMP has a rich set of functions, and the functions have a regular interface. The basic interface is for C, but wrappers exist for other languages, including Ada, C++, C#, Julia, .NET, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Python, R, Ruby, and Rust. Prior to 2008, Kaffe, a Java virtual machine, used GMP to support Java built-in arbitrary precision arithmetic. Shortly after, GMP support was added to GNU Classpath.

The main target applications of GMP are cryptography applications and research, Internet security applications, and computer algebra systems.

GMP aims to be faster than any other bignum library for all operand sizes. Some important factors in doing this are:
* Full words are the basic type for all arithmetic.
* Different algorithms are used for different operand sizes; algorithms which are more efficient with large numbers are not used when dealing with small numbers.
* Assembly language (specialized for different processors) is used in the most common inner loops to optimize them as much as possible.

The first GMP release was made in 1991. It is constantly developed and maintained.

GMP is part of the GNU project (although its website being off gnu.org may cause confusion), and is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

GMP is used for integer arithmetic in many computer algebra systems such as Mathematica and Maple. It is also used in the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL).

GMP is needed to build the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).

== Examples ==

Here is an example of C code showing the use of the GMP library to multiply and print large numbers:
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;gmp.h&gt;

int main(void) {
 mpz_t x, y, result;

 mpz_init_set_str(x, &quot;7612058254738945&quot;, 10);
 mpz_init_set_str(y, &quot;9263591128439081&quot;, 10);
 mpz_init(result);

 mpz_mul(result, x, y);
 gmp_printf(&quot; %Zd\n&quot;
 &quot;*\n&quot;
 &quot; %Zd\n&quot;
 &quot;--------------------\n&quot;
 &quot;%Zd\n&quot;, x, y, result);

 /* free used memory */
 mpz_clear(x);
 mpz_clear(y);
 mpz_clear(result);

 return 0;


This code calculates the value of 7612058254738945 × 9263591128439081.

Compiling and running this program gives this result. (The codice_1 flag is used if compiling on Unix-type systems.)
 7612058254738945
 9263591128439081
70514995317761165008628990709545
For comparison, one can write instead the following equivalent C++ program. (The codice_2 flags are used if compiling on Unix-type systems.)
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;gmpxx.h&gt;

int main() {
 mpz_class x(&quot;7612058254738945&quot;);
 mpz_class y(&quot;9263591128439081&quot;);

 std::cout « &quot; &quot; « x « &quot;\n&quot;
 « &quot;*\n&quot;
 « &quot; &quot; « y « &quot;\n&quot;
 « &quot;--------------------\n&quot;
 « x * y « &quot;\n&quot;;

 return 0;

<text>Schizaeales is an order of ferns (class Polypodiopsida).

==Description==
While the three clades of Schizaeales are all well-distinguished from one another by numerous morphological characters, members of the order all have dimorphic fertile and sterile fronds and lack well-defined sori. Their sporangia have a horizontal annulus that lies below and completely encircles the top of the sporangium. The two genera &quot;Actinostachys&quot; and &quot;Schizaea&quot; (except for &quot;Microschizaea&quot;) in the family Schizaeaceae have subterranean gametophytes without chlorophyll.

==Classification==
In the molecular phylogenetic classification of Smith et al. in 2006, the Schizaeales were placed in the leptosporangiate ferns, class Polypodiopsida. Three families, Anemiaceae, Lygodiaceae, and Schizaeaceae were recognized. The linear sequence of Christenhusz et al. (2011), intended for compatibility with the classification of Chase and Reveal (2009) which placed all land plants in Equisetopsida, reclassified Smith&#x27;s Polypodiopsida as subclass Polypodiidae and placed the Schizaeales there, with the same three families. The classification of Christenhusz and Chase (2014) placed all members of the Schizaeales in a more broadly defined Schizaeaceae, reducing the three existing families to subfamilies as Anemioideae, Lygodioideae, and Schizaeoideae. The PPG I classification (2016) returned to the three-family definition of the order.

Historically, the ferns in this order were once all lumped into the family Schizaeaceae in the old order Filicales. However, although they are demonstrably related, these ferns differ markedly, and so three groups have now been elevated to family status:

* The family Schizaeaceae are generally small ferns with forking fronds and a distinctive, somewhat non-fern-like, appearance.
* The family Anemiaceae look very fern-like and are typically terrestrial or epipetric.
* The family Lygodiaceae, or climbing ferns, look very ferny but are highly distinctive in their growth habit: the rachis of the frond is long and flexible, with indeterminate growth, so that the fronds form climbing or trailing vines.

At one time some workers believed the water ferns (order Salviniales) to be allied to this order because of certain structural similarities, but modern cladistic studies have ruled out any special alliance.

==Evolution==
Schizaeales had a northern hemisphere concentration as late as the Mesozoic, but by the Quaternary, there was a clear shift to a southern hemisphere distribution.

<doc id="483128" wikidata="Q1558808" url="?curid=483128" title="Stalwarts (politics)">
<text>The Stalwarts were a faction of the Republican Party that existed briefly in the United States during Reconstruction and the Gilded Age during the 1870s and 1880s. Led by U.S. Senator Roscoe Conkling—also known as &quot;Lord Roscoe&quot;—Stalwarts were sometimes called &quot;Conklingites&quot;. Other notable Stalwarts included Benjamin Wade, Charles J. Folger, George C. Gorham, Chester A. Arthur, Thomas C. Platt, and Leonidas C. Houk. The faction favored Ulysses S. Grant, the eighteenth President of the United States (1868–1876), running for a third term in the 1880 United States presidential election.

The designation of &quot;Stalwart&quot; to describe the faction was coined by James G. Blaine, who would later lead the rival &quot;Half-Breed&quot; faction during the Garfield administration. Blaine and his political organization formed an informal coalition with the Stalwarts during the presidency of Rutherford B. Hayes, supporting patronage and advocating on behalf of Southern blacks. The Maine Senator also frequently joined Stalwarts in voting against nominations of reformers by President Hayes who received the support of Democrats and staunch Half-Breed Republicans. Blaine applied the term to commend Conkling&#x27;s faction as devoted loyalists to the Republican Party&#x27;s principles.

Stalwarts were the traditional &quot;Old Guard&quot; Republicans, who advocated for the civil rights of African-Americans and opposed Rutherford B. Hayes&#x27;s efforts to enact civil service reform. They were pitted against the &quot;Half-Breeds&quot; (classically liberal moderates) for control of the Republican Party. The most prominent issue between Stalwarts and Half-Breeds was patronage. The Half-Breeds worked to enact moderate civil service reform, and finally helped pass the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act. This was signed by Arthur, who became President after the assassination of James A. Garfield, a Half-Breed. Stalwarts favored traditional machine politics.

==Background==
During the American Civil War and afterwards, congressional Radical Republicans feuded with Conservative Republicans who generally opposed efforts by Radical Republicans to rebuild the Southern U.S. under an economically mobile, free-market system and thrived politically on antipathy towards civil rights and black suffrage, and with Moderate Republicans, who were less enthusiastic than Radical Republicans about Black suffrage even though they otherwise embraced civil equality and the expansion of federal authority during the American Civil War. 

Over time, the power of the Radical Republicans disintegrated as members became disenchanted with the associated corruption during the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant. Many remaining Radicals, unwavering in their tactic of &quot;waving the bloody shirt&quot; and their defense of black civil rights, formed the Stalwarts, including but not limited to Roscoe Conkling, Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, John A. Logan, Zachariah Chandler, Benjamin Butler, William B. Allison, Benjamin Wade, and Oliver P. Morton.

==Characteristics==

The Stalwarts were mostly identifiable through their support of the presidency and re-election of Ulysses S. Grant. The 1880 Republican National Convention was the event in which the group participated most prominently. Of the Stalwarts present, most were from former Confederate states, with others being from New York, Illinois, and Pennsylvania, home to some prominent Republican leaders. Deemed as loyalists to the policies pursued under the Grant administration, they stood in favor of hard money, high tariffs, waving the bloody shirt, and Southern Republicanism led by freedmen and carpetbaggers.

Although commonly described as &quot;conservative&quot;, Stalwarts were not uniformly bound on ideology aside from their advocacy of spoils system politics and African-American civil rights. Some members, including John A. Logan, broke with the standard Republican Party position on the issue of protective tariffs and favored lower rates.

Stalwarts were more cautious in policy than non-Stalwarts, preferring to avoid controversial policies popular with other Republicans, such as a higher protective tariff. This caution led the Stalwarts to support the nomination of Grant, a popular former president, at the 1880 Republican National Convention.

==Hayes presidency==
===Conkling rebukes Hayes in Port Collector fight===
The Collector of the Port of New York was a powerful and prized political position, with the officeholder being able to control a central location of trade between the United States and other nations. New York had for many years hitherto been managed by the powerful patronage machine of Conkling, with opponents of the New York boss vying for control.

President Hayes attempted to wrest control of the Port from Conkling to no avail, twice picking his own political acolytes to the post only to have the nominations defeated in the Senate by the New York senator, who successfully rallied Republicans to his side. Among Hayes&#x27; earlier nominations to the post of New York Collector of Customs was Theodore Roosevelt Sr., the father of future president Theodore Roosevelt. The nomination of Roosevelt Sr. was defeated due to overwhelming Republican opposition in the U.S. Senate. The Stalwarts&#x27; opposition towards Roosevelt Sr. was joined by James G. Blaine, while Half-Breeds George F. Hoar and Stanley Matthews voted for the nomination.

Conkling later managed to secure the position of New York Customs House boss for close machine ally and future president Chester A. Arthur.

===Hayes and Sherman fire Arthur===
Arthur&#x27;s tenure was marked with corruption and extensive preference of party loyalties over qualifications. He was known to have turned a blind eye to corruption in the New York Customs House, in addition to hiring thousands of Republicans for government jobs on the mere basis of partisan affiliation.

Following an investigation of the Customs House in 1877, President Hayes and Secretary of the Treasury John Sherman, a Half-Breed, fired Arthur the following year. This decision was criticized even by congressional members of the Blaine faction, who began to distance themselves from Hayes. The Hayes administration subsequently emerged victorious in several intraparty battles, successfully nominating Edwin Atkins Merritt and Silas W. Burt to prominent positions in New York. Although Republican opposition towards Hayes considerably eroded in contrast to the defeat of Roosevelt Sr.&#x27;s nomination, the Stalwarts and Blaine faction remained, at this point, informally united in persistent antipathy towards the president&#x27;s reform advocacy.

==1880 Republican National Convention==
In 1880, Stalwarts led by Conkling, Logan, and Simon Cameron fiercely advocated nominating former president Ulysses S. Grant for a non-consecutive, third presidential term. The Half-Breeds advocated the nomination of Senator George F. Edmunds of Vermont, while the Blaine faction sought a presidential term for James G. Blaine. Although Grant had previously pushed for some degree of civil service reform as president, he became disenchanted with Hayes&#x27; efforts to effectively dismantle the Stalwarts&#x27; patronage machines. Conkling, who previously was a close ally to Grant during the latter&#x27;s presidency, once again became a right-hand man.

The Stalwarts, in a bid for power within their own party in spite of their loss of power due to the rise in popularity of the Democratic Party, stubbornly supported the nomination of Ulysses S. Grant, who, if elected, would be serving a third, non-consecutive term. Bitter factionalism emerged, primarily between the Conkling and Blaine wings of the party. Chief allies of Blaine, William P. Frye and Eugene Hale, proved unable to thoroughly debate the shrewd Conkling, who &quot;humiliated&quot; Frye in a manner deemed &quot;half sneer and half insult.&quot;

A stalemate ensued between the Half-Breeds, Blaine faction, and the Stalwarts, so a compromise was struck by the Blaine faction and supporters of John Sherman to nominate James A. Garfield, with Chester A. Arthur, former Collector of the Port of New York, as his running mate, to satisfy the Stalwarts and thereby ensure their support for the general election. 
For the vice presidential pick, Garfield at first proposed nominating Treasury of the Secretary John Sherman, a staunch Half-Breed, Moderate Republican, and supporter of civil service reform who Stalwarts loathed. In an appeal to party unity for both factions to be somewhat pleased, Conkling ally Chester &quot;Chet&quot; Arthur became Garfield&#x27;s running mate, to the horror of Half-Breeds who pejoratively dubbed him as Conkling&#x27;s &quot;creature.&quot; The pair narrowly would win the general election in November that year.

== Decline ==
After the Republican victory in November 1880, President Garfield and Conkling fought bitterly and publicly over patronage in Conkling&#x27;s home state of New York. Garfield, with assistance and advice from Blaine, won the battle, and Conkling and Platt resigned from the Senate, convinced that they would be easily re-elected by the New York legislature. However, Garfield was shot by a self-proclaimed &quot;Stalwart of the Stalwarts&quot;, Charles J. Guiteau, on July 2, 1881, and Arthur became President of the United States upon Garfield&#x27;s death on September 19, 1881. The shock of the assassination broke both Conkling&#x27;s power and that of the Stalwarts, and Conkling&#x27;s former protege Arthur helped to create civil service reforms in his term, in part because he felt that he had to follow up on and finish Garfield&#x27;s work.

The Pendleton Act passed with no Senate Republican opposition. Remaining Senate Stalwarts, including John A. Logan, William B. Allison, J. Donald Cameron, voted for passage. Only seven House Republicans (being Benjamin F. Marsh, James S. Robinson, Robert Smalls, William Robert Moore, Orlando Hubbs, John Robert Thomas, and George Washington Steele) voted against passage of the Pendleton Act.

In the 1884 United States presidential election, Conkling and Platt opposed the Republican Party renomination of their former ally Arthur. The nomination went to James G. Blaine, who Conkling continued loathing and refused to lend any support to in spite of the vice presidential selection going to Stalwart John A. Logan. When asked to campaign for the ticket, Conkling remarked: &quot;I don&#x27;t engage in criminal practice.&quot;

In some states such as Wisconsin, the term &quot;stalwart&quot; continued to be used in reference to the conservative element of those states&#x27; Republican parties in contrast to the progressive elements, well into the 1930s.

<text>The &quot;North Carolina&quot; class were a pair of fast battleships, and , built for the United States Navy in the late 1930s and early 1940s.

In planning a new battleship class in the 1930s, the US Navy was heavily constrained by international treaty limitations, which included a requirement that all new capital ships have a standard displacement of under . This restriction meant that the navy could not construct a ship with the firepower, armor, and speed that they desired, and the balancing uncertainty that resulted meant that the navy considered fifty widely varying designs.

Eventually, the General Board of the United States Navy declared its preference for a battleship with a speed of , faster than any in US service, with a main battery of nine /50 caliber Mark B guns. The board believed that these ships would be balanced enough to effectively take on a multitude of roles. However, the acting Secretary of the Navy authorized a modified version of a different design, which in its original form had been rejected by the General Board. This called for a ship with twelve 14-inch guns in quadruple turrets and protection against guns of the same caliber. In a major departure from traditional American design practices, this design prioritized firepower at the cost of speed and protection. After construction had begun, the United States invoked a so-called &quot;escalator clause&quot; in the international treaty to increase the class&#x27; main armament to nine /45 caliber Mark 6 guns.

Both &quot;North Carolina&quot; and &quot;Washington&quot; saw extensive service during the Second World War in a variety of roles, primarily in the Pacific Theater where they escorted fast carrier task forces, such as during the Battle of the Philippine Sea, and conducted shore bombardments. &quot;Washington&quot; also participated in a surface engagement, the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, where its radar-directed main batteries fatally damaged the Japanese battleship . Both battleships were damaged during the war, with &quot;North Carolina&quot; taking a torpedo hit in 1942 and &quot;Washington&quot; colliding with in 1944. After the end of the war, both ships remained in commission for a brief time before being laid up in reserve. In the early 1960s, &quot;North Carolina&quot; was sold to the state of North Carolina as a museum ship, and &quot;Washington&quot; was broken up for scrap.

== Background ==
After the end of the First World War, several navies continued and expanded naval construction programs that they had started during the conflict. The United States&#x27; 1916 program called for six s and five battleships; in December 1918, the administration of President Woodrow Wilson called for building an additional ten battleships and six battlecruisers. The 1919–1920 General Board proposals planned for slightly smaller, but still significant, acquisitions beyond the 1916 plan: two battleships and a battlecruiser for the fiscal year 1921, and three battleships, a battlecruiser, four aircraft carriers and thirty destroyers between the fiscal years 1922 and 1924. The United Kingdom was in the final stages of ordering eight capital ships (the G3 battlecruisers, with the first&#x27;s keel laying in 1921, and N3-class battleships, to be laid down beginning in 1922). Imperial Japan was, by 1920, attempting to build up to an 8-8 standard of eight battleships and eight battlecruisers or cruisers with the , , , and classes. Two ships from these designs were to be laid down per year until 1928.

With the staggering costs associated with such programs, the United States&#x27; Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes invited delegations from the major maritime powers—France, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom—to come together in Washington, D.C. to discuss, and hopefully end, the naval arms race. The subsequent Washington Naval Conference resulted in the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty. Along with many other provisions, it limited all future battleships to a standard displacement of and a maximum gun caliber of 16 inches. It also decreed that the five countries could not construct another capital ship for ten years and could not replace any ship that survived the treaty until it was at least twenty years old. The 1936 Second London Naval Treaty kept many of the Washington treaty&#x27;s requirements but restricted gun size on new warships to 14 inches.

The treaties heavily influenced the design of the &quot;North Carolina&quot; class, as can be attested to in the long quest to find a ship that incorporated everything the US Navy considered necessary while remaining under 35,000 long tons.

== Design ==

=== Early ===
With the end of the capital ship construction &quot;holiday&quot; approaching, the General Board began preparations for a new class of battleships in May–July 1935, and three design studies were submitted to them. &quot;A&quot; would be armed with nine guns in triple turrets, all forward of the bridge; capable of 30 knots; and armored against 14-inch shells. &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; would both be over , able to reach , and armored against 14-inch shells. The major difference between the two was the planned main battery, as &quot;B&quot; had twelve 14-inch guns in triple turrets, while &quot;C&quot; had eight 16-inch/45-caliber guns in dual turrets. &quot;A&quot; was the only one to remain within the 35,000-ton displacement limit set in the Washington Naval Treaty and reaffirmed in the Second London Naval Treaty. When the Bureau of Ordnance introduced a &quot;super-heavy&quot; 16-inch shell, the ships were redesigned in an attempt to provide protection against it, but this introduced severe weight problems; two of the designs were nearly over the treaty limit.

Although these original three studies were all &quot;fast&quot; battleships, the General Board was not committed to the higher maximum speeds. It posed questions to the Naval War College, asking for their opinion as to whether the new class should be a &quot;conventional&quot; ship with an eight-nine, 16-inch main battery, or rather one akin to &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; or &quot;C&quot;.

Five more design studies were produced in late September 1935, which had characteristics of 23–30.5 knots, eight or nine 14- or 16-inch guns, and a standard displacement between . Designs &quot;D&quot; and &quot;E&quot; were attempts at fast battleships with 16-inch guns and protections against the same, but their displacement was greater than the Washington Naval Treaty allowed. Design &quot;F&quot; was a radical attempt at a hybrid battleship-carrier, with three catapults mounted fore and eight 14-inch guns aft. It was reportedly favored by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, but as aircraft launched from catapults were necessarily inferior to most carrier- or land-based aircraft because of the floats used to land, nothing came of the design. Designs &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; were slower 23-knot ships with nine 14-inch guns; in particular, &quot;H&quot; was thought to be a very well balanced design by the Preliminary Design section of the Bureau of Construction and Repair. However, the General Board finally decided to use faster ships, which &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; were not.

These studies demonstrated the difficulty the designers faced with a displacement of 35,000 tons. They could choose a faster ship, able to steam at 30 knots, but that would force them to mount a lighter armament and armor than contemporary foreign battleships. Alternatively, they could choose a lower maximum speed and mount heavier guns, but fitting in adequate protection against newer 16-inch guns would be extremely difficult. The Preliminary Design section drew up five more studies in October, based upon &quot;A&quot; with additional armor or a scaled-down &quot;B&quot;; all used 14-inch guns and called for at least 30 knots. Two called for four turrets, but they would be too heavy and mount less armor. Another, &quot;K,&quot; would have a belt and deck, giving it a immune zone against the United States&#x27; super-heavy 14-inch shell. While &quot;K&quot; was liked by the naval constructors, its designed standard displacement of 35,000 tons left little room for error, modifications, or improvements. The final two designs, &quot;L&quot; and &quot;M,&quot; would use quadruple turrets to save weight (similar to the French ) while still mounting 12 guns.

Many officers in the United States Navy supported the construction of three or four fast battleships for carrier escorts and to counter Japan&#x27;s . These included the acting Secretary of the Navy and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William Standley, the president of the Naval War College Admiral William S. Pye, a small majority (9–7) of senior officers at sea, and five of six line officers engaged in strategic planning as part of the War Plans Division, although at least one officer believed that an aerial attack would also be capable of sinking the &quot;Kongō&quot;s. With the above recommendations, the General Board selected &quot;K&quot; to undergo further development.

=== Final ===
At least 35 different final designs were proposed. All numbered with Roman numerals (&quot;I&quot; through &quot;XVI-D&quot;), the first five were completed on 15 November 1935. They were the first to employ so-called &quot;paper&quot; weight reductions: not counting certain weights towards the ship&#x27;s 35,000 long ton treaty limit that were not specifically part of the definition of standard displacement. In this case, even though there was designed storage room for 100 shells per main battery gun and an extra 100 rounds, the weight of the rounds did not figure toward the treaty-mandated limit.

These final designs varied greatly in everything but their standard displacements and speeds. Just one was over the treaty displacement limit; every other design called for 35,000 long tons. Only five planned for a top speed of under ; of those, only one was lower than : &quot;VII&quot;, with . &quot;VII&quot; returned to a lower speed to obtain more firepower (twelve 14-inch guns in triple turrets) and protection; as such, the design called for only and a length of only . Most other plans called for or , although a few had lengths between and . Several different gun mountings were examined, including eight, nine, ten, eleven, and twelve 14-inch guns; eight 14-inch guns in two quadruple turrets, and even one design with two quadruple 16-inch guns.
One specific design, &quot;XVI,&quot; was a , ship with twelve 14-inch guns, a belt, and a deck thick. Produced on 20 August 1936, the Bureau of Ordnance found many problems in it. For example, model tests showed that at high speeds, waves generated by the hull would leave certain lower parts of the ship uncovered by water or adequate armor, including around the explosive magazines, and the Bureau believed that hits around this part of the hull were easily possible when fighting at ranges between . Other problems included the design&#x27;s defense against aircraft-dropped bombs, as the Bureau thought the formula used to calculate its effectiveness was not realistic, and the tapering of a fore bulkhead below the waterline could worsen underwater shell hits because the mostly unarmored bow could easily be penetrated. The proposed solutions for these issues were all impractical: added patches of armor around the magazines could neutralize the effectiveness of the ship&#x27;s torpedo-defense system, and deepening the belt near the bow and stern would put the ships over the 35,000 long ton limit. The General Board detested this design, saying it was &quot;not ... a true battleship&quot; due to its speed and armor problems.

To address these problems, a final set of designs was presented by the Preliminary Design section in October 1936. Designated &quot;XVI-B&quot; through &quot;XVI-D,&quot; they were all modifications of the &quot;XVI&quot; plan. These added an extra of length to &quot;XVI&quot; for greater speed, but the resulting weight increase meant that only eleven 14-inch guns could be mounted with a thin belt. Another gun could be traded for a belt, and yet another could be swapped for more speed and an extra tenth of an inch of belt armor; this became design &quot;XVI-C&quot;. The General Board liked &quot;XVI-C&quot; very much, seeing in it a ship that had enough protection to fight—and survive—in a battle line formed with the US&#x27; older battleships while also having enough speed to operate in a detached wing with aircraft carrier or cruiser commerce raiding groups.

However, one member of the Board, Admiral Joseph Reeves—one of the principal developers of the United States&#x27; aircraft carrier strategy—disliked &quot;XVI-C&quot; because he believed that it was not fast enough to work with the fast carriers, and it was not powerful enough to justify its cost. Instead, he advocated a development of the previously rejected &quot;XVI&quot;, adding additional underwater protection and patches of armor within the ship to make the magazines immune to above- and below-water shell hits from and beyond. The immune zone&#x27;s outer limit was increased from to . After further revisions, Reeves went to Standley, the Chief of Naval Operations, who approved &quot;XVI&quot; in its newly modified form over the hopes of the General Board, who still thought that &quot;XVI-C&quot; should be built. Standley&#x27;s only addition to the characteristics was to be able to switch from quadruple 14-inch to triple turrets if the &quot;escalator clause&quot; in the Second London Naval Treaty was invoked.

With these parameters now set, &quot;XVI&quot; would become the basis of the &quot;North Carolina&quot; class&#x27; as-built design despite additional back and forth over the design&#x27;s final particulars. These included an increase in armor; something allowed by the finding of more on-paper weight savings; the armor&#x27;s slope was increased from 10° to 13°, and eventually settled at 15°; a months-long debate on the propulsion machinery&#x27;s layout was finally concluded, and other minor changes.

=== The &quot;escalator clause&quot; ===

Although the Second London Naval Treaty stipulated that warship guns could be no larger than 14 inches, a so-called &quot;escalator clause&quot; was included at the urging of American negotiators in case any country that had signed the Washington Naval Treaty refused to adhere to this new limit. The provision allowed signatory countries of the Second London Treaty—France, the United Kingdom and the United States—to raise the limit from 14 to 16 inches if Japan or Italy still refused to sign after 1 April 1937. When figuring potential configurations for the &quot;North Carolina&quot;s, designers focused most of their planning on 14-inch weaponry; Standley&#x27;s requirement meant that a switch from 14- to 16-inch, even after the ships&#x27; keels had been laid, was possible. Japan formally rejected the 14-inch limit on 27 March 1937, meaning that the &quot;escalator clause&quot; &quot;could&quot; be invoked. There were hurdles that still needed to be overcome, though: Roosevelt was under heavy political pressure and, as a result, was reluctant to allow the 16-inch gun.

Admiral Reeves also came out strongly in favor of the larger weapon. In a two-page letter to Secretary of the Navy Claude A. Swanson and indirectly to Roosevelt, Reeves argued that the 16-inch gun&#x27;s significantly greater armor penetration was of paramount importance, drawing examples from the First World War&#x27;s Battle of Jutland, where some battleships were able to survive ten or twenty hits from large guns, but other battlecruisers were blown up in three to seven hits because the shells were able to cut through the armor protecting magazines and turrets. Reeves also argued that the larger gun would favor the &quot;indirect method&quot; of shooting then being developed, where airplanes would be used to relay targeting information to allied battleships so that they could bombard targets that were out of their sight or over the horizon, because new battleships being built by foreign powers would have more armor. Reeves believed that if the 14-inch gun was adopted, it would not be able to penetrate this larger amount of protection, whereas the 16-inch would be able to break through.

In a final vain attempt, Roosevelt&#x27;s Secretary of State Cordell Hull sent a telegram on 4 June to the Ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew instructing him that the United States would still accept a cap of 14-inch guns if he could get Japan to as well. The Japanese replied that they could not accept this unless the number of battleships was also limited; they wanted the United States and the United Kingdom to agree to having an equal number of battleships with Japan, but this was a condition that the two countries refused to accept. On 24 June, the two &quot;North Carolina&quot;s were ordered with the 14-inch weapons, but on 10 July, Roosevelt directed that they be armed with triple 16-inch instead.
== Specifications ==
=== General characteristics ===
The &quot;North Carolina&quot; was long at the waterline and long overall. The maximum beam was while waterline beam was due to the inclination of the armor belt. In 1942, the standard displacement was while full load displacement was , while maximum draft was . At design combat displacement of , the mean draft was and (GM) metacentric height was . As designed, the crew complement was 1,880 with 108 officers and 1,772 enlisted. By 1945, the considerable increase in anti-aircraft armament and their crew accommodations had increased full load displacement to , while crew complement increased to 2,339 with 144 officers and 2,195 enlisted. After the end of World War II, the crew complement was reduced to 1,774.

The &quot;North Carolina&quot; class hull feature a bulbous bow and had an unusual stern design for the time by placing the two inboard propulsion shafts in skegs. This was theorized to improve flow conditions to the propellers. Initial model basin testing for various stern configurations suggested that the skeg arrangement could reduce resistance, although later testing during the design process of the battleship would indicate an increase in drag. The skegs improved the structural strength of the stern by acting as girders and also provided structural continuity for the torpedo bulkheads. However, the skegs also contributed to severe vibration problems with the class that required extensive testing and modifications to mitigate. The problem was particularly acute near the aft main battery director, which required additional reinforcing braces due to the vibrations. Nevertheless, skegs would be improved and incorporated in the designs of all subsequent American battleships, with vibration problems largely eliminated on the &quot;Iowa&quot; class battleships.

=== Armament ===
&quot;North Carolina&quot; and &quot;Washington&quot; were principally armed with nine /45 caliber (cal) Mark 6 guns and twenty /38 cal Mark 12 guns. Their lighter armament consisted of varying numbers of /75 caliber, .50 caliber machine guns, Bofors 40 mm and Oerlikon 20 mm.

==== Main battery ====
Mounted on both the &quot;North Carolina&quot; class and the follow-up , the nine 16 in/45 were improved versions of the guns mounted on the s, hence the designation of &quot;Mark 6&quot;. A major alteration from the older guns was the Mark 6&#x27;s ability to fire a new armor-piercing (AP) shell developed by the Bureau of Ordnance. At full charge with a brand-new gun, the heavy shell would be expelled at a muzzle velocity of . At a reduced charge, the same shell would be fired at . Barrel life—the approximate number of rounds a gun could fire before needing to be relined or replaced—was 395 shells when using AP, although if only practice shells were used this figure was significantly higher: 2,860. Turning at 4 degrees a second, each turret could to 150 degrees on either side of the ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;16/45&quot;&gt;DiGiulian, &quot;16&quot;/45 (40.6 cm) Mark 6&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The guns could be elevated to a maximum inclination of 45 degrees; turrets one and three could depress to −2 degrees, but due to its superfiring position, the guns on turret two could only depress to 0 degrees.

Each gun was long overall; its bore and rifling length were and , respectively. Maximum range with the heavy AP shell was obtained at an inclination of 45 degrees: . At the same elevation a lighter high capacity (HC) shell would travel . The guns weighed not including the breech; the turrets weighed .

When firing the same shell, the 16-inch/45 Mark 6 had a slight advantage over the 16-inch/50 Mark 7 when hitting deck armor—a shell from a 45 cal gun would be slower, meaning that it would have a steeper trajectory as it descended. At , a shell from a 45 cal would strike a ship at an angle of 47.5 degrees, as opposed to 38 degrees with the 50 cal.

==== Secondary battery ====
The &quot;North Carolina&quot;s carried ten Mark 28 Mod 0 enclosed base ring mounts, each supporting twin 5-inch/38-caliber Mark 12 guns&lt;ref name=&quot;5/38&quot;&gt;DiGiulian, 5&quot;/38 (12.7 cm) Mark 12&lt;/ref&gt; Originally designed to be mounted on destroyers built in the 1930s, these guns were so successful that they were added to a myriad of American ships during the Second World War, including every major ship type and many smaller warships constructed between 1934 and 1945. They were considered to be &quot;highly reliable, robust and accurate&quot; by the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Ordnance.

The 5-inch/38 functioned as a dual purpose gun. However, this did not mean that it possessed inferior anti-air abilities; as established during 1941 gunnery tests conducted on board &quot;North Carolina&quot;, the gun possessed the ability to consistently shoot down aircraft flying at , which was twice as far as the effective range of the earlier single purpose 5-inch/25 anti-air gun.

Each 5-inch/38 weighed almost without the breech. The entire mount weighed . It was long overall, had a bore length of , and had a rifling length of . The gun could fire shells at about ; about 4,600 could be fired before the barrel needed to be replaced. Minimum and maximum elevations were −15 and 85 degrees, respectively. The guns&#x27; elevation could be raised or lowered at about 15 degrees per second. Loading was possible at any elevation. The mounts closest to the bow and stern could aim from −150 to 150 degrees; the others were restricted to −80 to 80 degrees. They could be turned at about 25 degrees per second.

==== Smaller weaponry ====
The remaining weaponry on board the two &quot;North Carolina&quot;s was composed of differing numbers of 1.1&quot;/75 caliber guns, .50 caliber machine guns, Bofors 40 mm and Oerlikon 20 mm cannons. Although the ships were originally designed to carry only four quadruple 1.1 in and twelve .50 caliber, this was greatly increased and upgraded during the war.

On both ships, two more quadruple sets of 1.1 in guns were added in place of two searchlights amidships. After it was torpedoed in 1942, &quot;North Carolina&quot; had these removed and ten quadruple sets of 40 mm guns added. Fourteen were present by June 1943, while a fifteenth mount was added on top of the third main turret that November. &quot;Washington&quot; retained its six 1.1 in quads until the middle of 1943, when ten quad 40 mm guns replaced them. By August, it had fifteen. The two ships carried these through to the close of the war.

The .50 caliber machine guns did not have the range or power needed to combat modern aircraft and were scheduled for replacement by equal numbers of 20 mm guns, but nothing immediately came of the proposal. In fact, both &quot;North Carolina&quot; and &quot;Washington&quot; carried 20 mm and .50 caliber guns for most of 1942. In April, &quot;North Carolina&quot; had, respectively, forty and twelve, while &quot;Washington&quot; had twenty and twelve. Two months later, the number of 20 mm guns remained the same, but twelve .50 caliber guns had been added. By September, &quot;Washington&quot; had twenty more 20 mm guns added, for a total of forty, but five were removed—along with all of the .50 caliber guns—shortly thereafter when two quadruple sets of 1.1 in guns were added. In its refit after being torpedoed, &quot;North Carolina&quot; had an additional six 20 mm guns added and all of its .50 caliber weapons removed. &quot;Washington&quot; had sixty-four 20 mm weapons by April 1943, prior to one single mount being replaced by a quadruple mount, and &quot;North Carolina&quot; had fifty-three by March 1944. In April 1945, &quot;North Carolina&quot; was assigned to have fifty-six 20 mm, while &quot;Washington&quot; was assigned seventy-five. In August 1945, the ships both had eight twin 20 mm mounts; &quot;North Carolina&quot; also carried twenty single, while &quot;Washington&quot; carried one quad and sixty-three single.

=== Electronics ===

Both &quot;North Carolina&quot; and &quot;Washington&quot;, designed prior to radar, were originally fitted with many fire-control and navigational optical range-finders. The former lasted until 1944, when it was replaced by a Mark 27 microwave radar supplemented by a Mark 3 main armament fire control radar. The range-finders were removed in favor of additional 20 mm guns sometime between the end of 1941 and mid-1942. In addition, the ships were commissioned with two Mark 38 directors and were originally fitted with a CXAM air search, two Mark 3s and three Mark 4 secondary armament.

By November 1942, &quot;North Carolina&quot; had an additional Mark 4 and a SG surface search radar added. The normal battleship configuration was present aboard &quot;North Carolina&quot; in April 1944, with SK and SG radars (air and surface search, respectively), a backup SG, and Mark 8s to direct its main battery. All of the Mark 4s remained for the secondary battery, and one of the older Mark 3s was still present, possibly as a backup for the Mark 8s. An SK-2 dish replaced the older SK radar and Mark 12s and 22s superseded the Mark 4s in September of that year. Aside from never receiving an SK-2, &quot;Washington&quot; was the recipient of similar upgrades.

Both ships underwent extensive refits near the end or after the war. &quot;North Carolina&quot; received a secondary air search set (SR) and a SCR-720 zenith search radar on the forward funnel. At the end of the war, it had an SP surface-search, a SK-2 air-search, a Mark 38 main battery fire control system with Mark 13 and 27 radars, a Mark 37 secondary battery fire control system with Mark 12, 22 and 32 radars, and a Mark 57 smaller weaponry fire control system, with a Mark 34 radar. In March 1946, &quot;Washington&quot; had a SK fore and a SR aft, a SG both fore and aft, and a TDY jammer (which could scramble radar on other ships).

=== Propulsion ===
The ships in the &quot;North Carolina&quot; class were equipped with four General Electric geared turbines and eight Babcock &amp; Wilcox three-drum express type boilers. The ships&#x27; powerplant incorporated several recent developments in turbine equipment, including double helical reduction gears and high-pressure steam technology. &quot;North Carolina&quot;″s boilers supplied steam at and as hot as . To meet the design requirement of , the engine system was originally designed to supply , but the new technologies increased this output to . Despite this increase, the maximum speed for the ships did not change, since the modifications to the powerplant were incorporated later in the design process. The turbines that had already been installed could not fully take advantage of the higher pressure and temperature steam, and so the level of efficiency was not as high as it should have been. When going astern, the engines provided .

The engine system was divided into four engine rooms, all on the centerline. Each room contained a turbine and two boilers, without any division between the boilers and turbines. This was done to limit the risk of capsizing should the ship sustain heavy flooding in the engine rooms. The engine rooms alternated in their layout: the first and third engine rooms were arranged with the turbine on the starboard side and its corresponding boilers on the port, this was reversed in the second and fourth rooms. The forward-most engine room powered the starboard outer shaft, the second turbine drove the outer screw on the port side, the third engine supplied power to the inner starboard propeller, and the fourth turbine drove the port-side inner screw. All four screws had four blades; the two outer propellers were in diameter and the inner pair were wide. Steering was controlled by a pair of rudders.

At the time of their commissioning, the ships had a top speed of , though by 1945, with the addition of other equipment, such as anti-aircraft weaponry, their maximum speed was reduced to . The increases in weight also reduced the ships&#x27; cruising range. In 1941, the ships could steam for at a cruising speed of ; by 1945, the range at that speed was reduced to . At , the range was considerably lower, at .

Electrical power was supplied by eight generators. Four were turbo-generators designed for naval use; these provided 1,250 kilowatts each. The other four were diesel generators that supplied 850 kilowatts each. Two smaller diesel generators—each provided 200 kilowatts—supplied emergency power should the main system be damaged. Total electrical output was 8,400 kilowatts, not including the emergency generators, at 450 volts on an alternating current.

=== Armor ===

The &quot;North Carolina&quot; class incorporated &quot;all or nothing&quot; armor which weighed 41% of the total displacement; it consisted of an &quot;armored raft&quot; that extended from just forward of the first gun turret to just aft of the rear gun turret. They had a main armored belt of Class A armor that was thick amidships, inclined at 15°, and backed by Special Treatment Steel (STS). This tapered down to on the lower edge of the belt. The ships had three armored decks; their main deck was thick. The second, thickest deck was of Class B armor laminated on STS for a total of . In the outboard sections of the hull the plating was Class B laminated on STS. The third and thinnest deck was thick inboard, and outboard. The first deck was designed to cause delay-fuzed projectiles to detonate, while the thicker second deck would protect the ships&#x27; internals. The third deck was intended to protect against shell splinters that might have penetrated the second deck; it also acted as the upper support for the torpedo bulkheads. The conning tower was connected to the armored citadel by a thick communications tube. Armor thickness for the conning tower itself ranged from on both sides to on the front and rear. The roof was thick and the bottom was thick.

The main battery turrets were heavily armored: the turret faces were thick, the sides were thick, the rear sides were thick, and the roofs were thick. Sixteen–inch-thick armor was the maximum width factories were able to produce at the time of the ships&#x27; design; by 1939, however, it was possible to create -thick plates. These were not installed because it was estimated that the conversion would delay completion of the ships by 6 to 8 months. The barbettes that held the turrets were also strongly protected. The front portion was , the sides increased to 16 in, and the rear portion reduced to . The 5-inch gun turrets, along with their ammunition magazines, were armored with STS plates.

The side protection system incorporated five compartments divided by torpedo bulkheads and a large anti-torpedo bulge that ran the length of the &quot;armored raft&quot;. The outer two compartments, the innermost compartment and the bulge would remain empty, while the third and fourth compartments would be filled with liquid. The system was reduced in depth at either end by the forward and rear gun turrets. In these areas, the fifth compartment was deleted; instead, there was an outer empty compartment and two liquid-filled spaces, backed by another empty compartment. To compensate for the reduced underwater protection system, these sections received additional armor plating, up to in thickness. The complete system was deep and designed to withstand warheads of up to of TNT. Underwater protection was rounded out by a triple bottom that was deep. The bottom layer was thick and was kept filled with fluid, while the upper thick layer was kept empty. The triple bottom was also heavily subdivided to prevent catastrophic flooding should the upper layer be penetrated.

=== Construction ===
Two ships, each to cost about $50 million, were authorized in January 1937. Five shipyards submitted bids to build one of the two planned ships. Three were privately run corporations: Bethlehem Shipbuilding, New York Shipbuilding and Newport News Shipbuilding. The other two, the New York Naval Shipyard and Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, were run by the government. When bids were reviewed, the privately run shipyards&#x27; submissions ranged from $46 to 50 million, while their government counterparts came in at $37 million. Newport News was unique among these in refusing any fixed monetary value in favor of a &quot;cost-plus %&quot; price, but this led to the rejection of their bid out of hand.

The bids from private companies were heavily influenced by the legislation of the New Deal. The Vinson–Trammell Act limited profit from a ship&#x27;s construction to 10 percent, while the Walsh–Healey Public Contracts Act specified a minimum wage and required working conditions for workers. The latter act greatly affected the ability of the navy to acquire steel, as the text of the law caused friction between executives in the industry, who greatly disliked the forty-hour work week and minimum wage requirements, and their workers—who themselves were embroiled in a separate dispute pitting the union of the skilled workers, the American Federation of Labor, against the union of the unskilled, the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Amid the unrest, the navy ran into difficulties trying to acquire 18 million pounds of steel to build six destroyers and three submarines; many more pounds than this would be needed for the new battleships.

The private shipyards, however, had their own labor problems, so much so that one author described the navy&#x27;s issues as &quot;minimal&quot; compared to their shipbuilding counterparts. This increased the price of the battleships to $60 million each, so the Bureau of Steam Engineering and Bureau of Construction and Repair recommended to their superiors that the $37 million tenders from the two navy yards be accepted. This was confirmed by Roosevelt, as the private shipyards&#x27; bids were seen as unjustly inflated. The contracts for &quot;North Carolina&quot; and &quot;Washington&quot;—names had been officially chosen on 3 May 1937—were sent to the New York and Philadelphia yards, respectively, on 24 June 1937. Shortly after this announcement, Roosevelt was bombarded with heavy lobbying from citizens and politicians from Camden and the state of New Jersey, in an ultimately futile attempt to have the construction of &quot;North Carolina&quot; shifted to Camden&#x27;s New York Shipbuilding; such a contract would keep many men employed in that area. Roosevelt refused, saying that the disparity in price was too great. Instead, the company was awarded two destroyer tenders in December 1937, and .

Construction of the &quot;North Carolina&quot; class was slowed by the aforementioned material issues, the changes made to the basic design after this date—namely the substitution of 16-inch for 14-inch guns—and the need to add both length and strength to the slipways already present in the navy yards. Increased use of welding was proposed as a possible way to reduce weight and bolster the structural design, as it could have reduced the ships&#x27; structural weight by 10%, but it was used in only about 30% of the ship. The costs associated with welding and an increase in the time of construction made it impractical.

=== &quot;North Carolina&quot; ===
 was laid down on 27 October 1937, the first battleship begun by the United States since the never-completed &quot;South Dakota&quot; class of the early 1920s. Although &quot;North Carolina&quot; was launched on 13 June 1940 and commissioned on 9 April 1941, it did not go on active duty because of acute longitudinal vibrations from its propeller shafts. A problem shared with its sister &quot;Washington&quot; and some other ships like , it was only cured after different propellers were tested aboard &quot;North Carolina&quot;, including four-bladed and cut-down versions of the original three-bladed. This testing required it to be at sea, and the many resulting trips out of New York Harbor to the Atlantic Ocean caused it to be nicknamed &quot;The Showboat&quot;.

After a shakedown cruise in the Caribbean Sea and participation in war exercises, &quot;North Carolina&quot; transited the Panama Canal &quot;en route&quot; to the Pacific War. Joining Task Force (TF) 16, the battleship escorted the aircraft carrier during the invasions of Guadalcanal and Tulagi on 7 August 1942, and continued to accompany the carrier when it moved to be southeast of the Solomons. The Battle of the Eastern Solomons began when Japanese carriers were spotted on 24 August; although American planes were able to strike first by sinking the light carrier , a strike group from a different force, formed around the fleet carriers and , attacked TF 16. In an intense eight-minute battle, &quot;North Carolina&quot; shot down 7–14 aircraft and was relatively undamaged, though there were seven near-misses and one crewman was killed by strafing. &quot;Enterprise&quot; took three bomb hits.
&quot;North Carolina&quot; then joined the carrier ″s screen, and protected it while support was rendered to American troops fighting on Guadalcanal. Although it dodged one torpedo on 6 September, it was not able to avoid another on the 15th. Out of a six-torpedo salvo from the , three hit the carrier , one hit , one missed, and one struck &quot;North Carolina&quot;. A warhead hit on the port side below the waterline at a point that was just behind the number one turret. It created a hole, allowed about of water into the ship—which had to be offset with counter-flooding, meaning that another entered—killed five men, and wounded twenty. Although &quot;North Carolina&quot; could steam at soon after the explosion, it was later forced to slow to to ensure that temporary shoring did not fail. Structural damage beneath the first turret rendered it unable to fire unless in absolute need, and the main search radar failed. As this was the first torpedo to strike a modern American battleship, there was a large amount of interest from various officers and bureaus within the navy in learning more about it. The conclusions were seen as a vindication by some who believed that too much had been sacrificed in the design of the &quot;North Carolina&quot;s—the torpedo defense system had come close to breaking near one of the most important areas of the ship (a magazine), after all—and the General Board called for the fifth and sixth s, and , to have a torpedo bulge added outside their magazines. However, the new Bureau of Ships opposed this on the basis that the system performed as it was supposed to; in any case, no modifications were made.

Repaired and refitted at the facilities in Pearl Harbor, &quot;North Carolina&quot; operated as a carrier escort for &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot; for the remainder of 1942 and the majority of 1943 while they provided cover for supply and troop movements in the Solomons. In between, it received advanced fire control and radar gear in March, April and September 1943 at Pearl Harbor. In November, &quot;North Carolina&quot; escorted &quot;Enterprise&quot; while the carrier launched strikes upon Makin, Tarawa and Abemama. On 1–8 December it bombarded Nauru before returning to carrier screening; it accompanied while that carrier launched attacks on Kavieng and New Ireland.

Joining Task Force 58 in January 1944, &quot;North Carolina&quot; escorted aircraft carriers as the flagship of Vice Admiral Willis A. Lee, Commander, Battleships, Pacific Fleet (ComBatPac) for much of the year, providing support for airborne strikes on Kwajalein, Namur, Truk (twice), Saipan, Tinian, Guam, Palau, Woleai, and Hollandia in January–April. Also in April, &quot;North Carolina&quot; destroyed defensive installations on Ponape before setting course for Pearl Harbor for repairs to a damaged rudder. With repairs completed, the battleship joined with &quot;Enterprise&quot; on 6 June for assaults within the Marianas; as part of these, &quot;North Carolina&quot; used its main battery to bombard Saipan and Tanapag.

In late June, &quot;North Carolina&quot; was one of the American ships which took part in the so-called &quot;Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot;, where a majority of attacking Japanese aircraft were shot down out of the air at little cost to the American defenders. Problems with its propeller shafts then caused the battleship to sail to the Puget Sound Navy Yard to receive an . It returned to active duty in November and to its carrier escort tasks in time to be hit by a typhoon. &quot;North Carolina&quot; protected carriers while they provided air cover for invasion fleets and launched attacks on Leyte, Luzon, and the Visayas. Surviving another typhoon, one which sank three destroyers, &quot;North Carolina&quot; continued escort duty when naval aircraft struck Formosa, Indo-China, China, the Ryukyus and Honshu in January and February 1945. During the invasion of Iwo Jima, the battleship provided bombardment support for troops ashore.
During the assault on Okinawa, &quot;North Carolina&quot; screened carriers and bombarded targets ashore. Although it was able to shoot down three kamikazes on 6 April, it was also struck by a shell during that time in a friendly fire incident; three were killed and forty-four injured. The battleship shot down a plane on the 7th and two on the 17th. After receiving another overhaul from 9 May to 28 June, this one in the naval yard at Pearl Harbor, &quot;North Carolina&quot; operated as both a carrier escort and shore bombardier for the remainder of the war. Of note was a 17 July bombardment of the industrial area in Hitachi, Ibaraki in company with fellow battleships , , and , along with smaller warships.

In August, members of &quot;North Carolina&quot;″s crew and Marine contingent were sent ashore to assist in occupying Japan. After the official surrender, these men were brought back aboard and the battleship sailed to Okinawa. As part of Operation &quot;Magic Carpet&quot;, soldiers were embarked to be returned to the United States. Passing through the locks of Panama Canal on 8 October, it weighed anchor in Boston on the 17th. After an overhaul in the New York Naval Yard, it participated in exercises off New England before beginning a midshipman training cruise in the Caribbean.

&quot;North Carolina&quot; was decommissioned in Bayonne, New Jersey on 27 June 1947; it remained in the reserve fleet in until 1 June 1960, when it was from the Naval Vessel Register. Instead of the scrapping that faced most of the United States&#x27; battleships, &quot;North Carolina&quot; was sold to the state of North Carolina for $250,000 on 8 August 1961 to be a museum ship. It was dedicated in Wilmington on 29 April 1962 as a memorial to the citizens of the state who died in the Second World War. Listed on the United States&#x27; National Register of Historic Places and designated as a National Historic Landmark on 1 January 1986, it remains there today, maintained by the USS North Carolina Battleship Commission.

=== &quot;Washington&quot; ===

 was laid down on 14 June 1938, launched on 1 June 1940 and commissioned on 15 May 1941 at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Although commissioned, its engine had not yet been run at full power—like its sister, &quot;Washington&quot; had major problems with longitudinal vibrations, which were only tempered after many tests conducted aboard &quot;North Carolina&quot;. The fixes made it possible to run builder&#x27;s trials, which &quot;Washington&quot; did on 3 August 1941; loaded at about , the propulsion plant was run up to , and repeated the performance again in February 1942, achieving .

In early 1942 Rear Admiral John W. Wilcox chose &quot;Washington&quot; as the flagship of Task Force 39. On 26 March 1942, &quot;Washington&quot;, along with &quot;Wasp&quot;, , and various smaller ships, sailed to bolster the British Home Fleet. During the voyage, Wilcox fell into the ocean; he was seen soon after by the destroyer , face down in the water, but due to rough seas they were unable to retrieve the body. It is not known what exactly happened; he could have simply been caught by a wave and washed overboard, but there has been speculation that he suffered a heart attack. The force reached the main anchorage of the Home Fleet, Scapa Flow, on 4 April.

&quot;Washington&quot; and the other ships of TF 39 participated in exercises with the Home Fleet until late April. Along with certain British units, the task force departed the British Isles as TF 99. They escorted some of the Arctic convoys which were carrying vital cargo to the Soviet Union. While carrying out this duty, an accompanying British battleship, HMS &quot;King George V&quot;, accidentally rammed a destroyer, cutting it in two. Directly behind &quot;King George V&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot; passed through the same stretch of sea and received damage from exploding depth charges. Though damage to the hull was minimal—limited to only one leaking fuel tank—many devices on board the ship were damaged, including main battery range finders, circuit breakers, three fire-control and the search radars. The American ships then put in at an Icelandic port, Hvalfjörður, until 15 May; they returned to Scapa Flow on 3 June. On 4 June, &quot;Washington&quot; hosted the commander of US naval forces in Europe, Admiral Harold Rainsford Stark, who set up a temporary headquarters on the ship for the next few days. On 7 June, King George VI of the United Kingdom inspected the battleship.
&quot;Washington&quot; left the North Sea bound for the United States on 14 July with an escort of four destroyers; upon arrival at the New York Naval Yard on the 23rd, it was given a full overhaul which took a month to be completed. It set sail for the Panama Canal and the Pacific Ocean on 23 August and reached its destination, Tonga Island, on 14 September, where it became the flagship of Admiral Willis &quot;Ching&quot; Lee. Over the coming months, &quot;Washington&quot; would be focused upon the safe arrival of supply convoys to the men fighting on Guadalcanal. On 13 November, three formations of Japanese ships were discovered on course for Guadalcanal, one of them aiming to bombard Henderson Field while night gave them protection from aircraft. The first Japanese bombardment force was driven back by an American cruiser-destroyer force. On 14 November, the Japanese organized another sortie to neutralize the airfield. &quot;Washington&quot;, , and four destroyers were sent to intercept the Japanese force that night. The Japanese, composed of the fast battleship , two heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and nine destroyers, initially sank three US destroyers and inflicted significant topside damage to &quot;South Dakota&quot;. However, &quot;Washington&quot; remained undetected and at midnight fired on &quot;Kirishima&quot; from , point blank range for &quot;Washington&quot;″s 16-inch/45-caliber guns. &quot;Washington&quot; fired seventy-five 16-inch and one hundred and seven 5-inch rounds during the melee, scoring 20 main and seventeen secondary battery hits, knocking out &quot;Kirishima&quot;&#x27;s steering and main battery and causing uncontrollable progressive flooding. &quot;Kirishima&quot; capsized at 03:25 on the morning of 15 November 1942, with 212 crewmen lost. Radar-directed fire from &quot;Washington&quot;″s secondary battery also damaged destroyer so severely it had to be scuttled. Soon after the battle, the Japanese began evacuating Guadalcanal.

Until April 1943, &quot;Washington&quot; stayed near its base in New Caledonia, providing protection for convoys and battle groups that were supporting the Solomons campaign. Returning to Pearl Harbor, it practiced for battle and underwent an overhaul before returning to the combat zone in late July. From August to the end of October, &quot;Washington&quot; operated out of Efate. It then joined with four battleships and six destroyers as Task Group (TG) 53.2 for exercises; &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and also participated. TG 52.2 then voyaged to the Gilbert Islands to add additional firepower to the strikes currently hitting them. Departing in late November, &quot;Washington&quot; first steamed to Makin to provide protection for ships there, then Ocean Island to prepare to bombard Nauru with its sister &quot;North Carolina&quot;, all four &quot;South Dakota&quot;-class battleships, and the carriers &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; and . All of the capital ships struck before dawn on 8 December; the aircraft carriers struck again soon after. The ships then sailed back to Efate, arriving on 12 December. On Christmas, &quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;North Carolina&quot;, and four destroyers left Efate for gunnery practice. By late January, it was made part of TG 50.1 to escort the fast carriers in that group as they launched strikes on Taroa and Kwajalein. It also moved in to hit Kwajalein with its guns on 30 January.
Before dawn on 1 February, with the sky still shrouded in darkness, &quot;Washington&quot; collided with when the latter left formation to fuel four destroyers. &quot;Indiana&quot; had radioed that it was going to make a turn to port out of the formation, but soon after starting the turn, its captain ordered a reversal, back to starboard. About seven minutes later, it came into view of lookouts aboard &quot;Washington&quot; at a range of . Although crews on both ships frantically tried to avoid the other, it was to no avail; &quot;Washington&quot; gave &quot;Indiana&quot; a glancing blow, scraping down a large aft portion of the ship&#x27;s starboard side. &quot;Washington&quot;″s fore end was severely damaged, with about of its bow hanging down and into the water. Ten men, six from &quot;Washington&quot;, were killed or listed as missing. After temporary reinforcements to the damaged section, it was forced to sail to Pearl Harbor to be fitted with a false bow to make possible a voyage to Puget Sound. Once there, it received a full overhaul, along with a new bow; this work lasted from March until April. &quot;Washington&quot; did not enter the war zone again until late May.

&quot;Washington&quot; next participated in the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, serving again as a carrier escort ship, though it was detached on the 13th to fire on Japanese positions on Saipan and Tinian. With the sortie of a majority of the remaining ships in the Imperial Japanese Navy spotted by American submarines, &quot;Washington&quot;, along with six other battleships, four heavy cruisers and fourteen destroyers covered the aircraft carriers of TF 58; on the 19th, with the attack of many aircraft, the Battle of the Philippine Sea began. Able to beat off the attacks, &quot;Washington&quot; refueled and continued escorting carriers until it formed a new task group with three battleships and escorts. After a lengthy stop at Enewetak Atoll, it supported troops assaulting Peleliu and Angaur before returning to screening duties. This duty lasted from 10 October to 17 February 1945.

The battleship bombarded Iwo Jima from 19–22 February in support of the invasion there before escorting carriers which sent aircraft raids against Tokyo and targets on the island of Kyūshū. On 24 March and 19 April, &quot;Washington&quot; bombarded Okinawa; it then departed for Puget Sound to receive a refit, having been in action for the majority of the time since its refit in March–April 1944. This lasted through V-J Day and the subsequent formal ceremony aboard &quot;Missouri&quot;, so &quot;Washington&quot; received orders to voyage to Philadelphia, where it arrived on 17 October. Here it was modified to have an additional 145 bunks so it could participate in Operation Magic Carpet. Sailing to Southampton with a reduced crew of 84 officers and 835 crew, it brought 185 army officers and 1,479 enlisted men back to the United States; this was the only voyage it would make in support of the operation. The battleship was placed into reserve at Bayonne, New Jersey on 27 June 1947, after only a little more than six years of service. &quot;Washington&quot; was never reactivated. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1960—exactly 21 years to the day since its launch—she was sold on 24 May 1961 to be scrapped.

== Post-war alteration proposals ==

&quot;North Carolina&quot; and &quot;Washington&quot; remained in active duty in the years immediately after the war, possibly because their crew accommodations were more comfortable and less cramped than the four &quot;South Dakota&quot;s. The ships received alterations during this period; the Ship Characteristics Board (SCB) directed in June 1946 that four of the quadruple-mounted 40 mm guns be removed, though only two were actually taken off each ship. The 20 mm weapons were also reduced at some point so that both ships were decommissioned with sixteen twin mounts. &quot;North Carolina&quot; and &quot;Washington&quot; were decommissioned on 27 June 1947 and subsequently moved to the reserve fleet.

In May 1954, SCB created a class improvement project for the &quot;North Carolina&quot;s which included twenty-four 3-inch/50 guns directed by six Mark 56s. A month later, the SCB chairman voiced his belief that the &quot;North Carolina&quot;s and &quot;South Dakota&quot;s would be excellent additions to task forces—if they could be faster. The Bureau of Ships then considered and discarded designs that would move these ships at , four knots faster than their current attainable speed. In order for a &quot;North Carolina&quot; to attain 31 knots, would be required. This, in turn, would necessitate the installation of an extremely large power plant, one which would not fit into the ship even if the third turret was removed. If the outer external belt armor were removed, would still be required. However, no matter if the belt was taken off or not, all of the hull form aft would have to be greatly modified to accept larger propellers. The last strike against the project was the high estimated cost of $40 million, which did not include the cost of activating battleships that had been out of commission for ten years.

Later calculations proved that the &quot;North Carolina&quot;s could be lightened from 44,377 long tons to around , at which 210,000 shp would suffice. At the trial displacement figure of , even would be enough; the 210,000 figure was derived from a 12.5% overestimation to account for a fouled bottom or bad weather. A similar power plant to the one used in the &quot;Iowa&quot; class (generating ) would be enough, and if the third turret was removed there would be no problems with weight, but there was not enough space within the &quot;North Carolina&quot;s. When compared, the current power plant measured , but &quot;Iowa&quot;″s was . Lastly, there would be an issue with the propellers; the &quot;Iowa&quot; class&#x27; were wide, while the &quot;North Carolina&quot;s were . In the end, no conversions were undertaken.

Designs for helicopter carriers also contained a plan for a conversion of the &quot;North Carolina&quot;s. At a cost of $30,790,000, the ships would have been able to embark 28 helicopters, 1,880 troops, of cargo and of oil. All of the 16-inch and 5-inch guns would have been removed, though the number one turret would have remained so that weights added on the stern half of the ship could be balanced. In place, the ships would have received sixteen 3-inch guns in twin mounts. Displacement would be lowered slightly to a fully loaded weight of about , while speed would not have changed. It was estimated that the ships could serve for about fifteen to twenty years at a cost of about $440,000 a year for maintenance. However, it was found that a purpose-built helicopter carrier would be more economical, so the plans were shelved.

<text>Hafenstraße is a street in St. Pauli, a quarter of Hamburg, Germany, known for its legalized squats. The squats were occupied in 1981 and became a figurehead for autonomist and anti-imperialist politics. After a prolonged battle with the city council which involved demonstrations of over 10,000 people, the buildings were legalized in the 1990s. Today they are owned by a self-organised cooperative.

== Occupation ==
Hafenstraße (German &quot;Hafen&quot; – harbour; &quot;Straße&quot; – street) is a common German abbreviation of &quot;St. Pauli-Hafenstraße&quot;, a street in St. Pauli, a quarter of Hamburg, Germany.

The Hafenstraße occupation began in 1981, when twelve buildings were squatted. They were to become extremely important symbols for the German squatters movement and for urban activists more generally. Students who were already living there joined with autonomists to save the buildings on Hafenstraße and Bernhard-Nocht-Straße from being demolished. The apartment blocks had been constructed in 1900 and were in serious need of renovation. It was not noticed that the buildings had been squatted until 1982, when the owner SAGA immediately reported the trespass and the police evicted the squatters. The buildings were quickly reoccupied. The squatters then signed a three-year temporary use contract and argued they should be permitted to restore the buildings themselves. This led to conflict with the city council, which repeatedly attempted to evict them.

== History ==
As well as building a permanent fortress to resist evictions, the squatters organized a pirate radio station and a Volxküche (cafe) which was founded in 1982 and still exists. Christian Lochte, head of the Department for Protection of the Constitution of Hamburg, claimed that women from the Red Army Faction were living at Hafenstraße and the Hamburgische Electricitäts-Werke (HEW -Hamburg Energy Company) frequently raided the buildings. In June 1984, Hafenstraße was widely condemned after a woman was raped and tortured by three squatters; the three perpetrators were beaten up, had their heads shaved and were ejected from the houses. The controversy generated debate about sexism and violence in the autonomist movement. One apartment in the buildings became a women-only space.

In the 1980s, Hafenstraße became a centre for autonomist and anti-imperialist politics. If the factions disagreed on an issue, they were united in the defence of the houses. Other struggles included publicising the hunger strike of imprisoned RAF members in 1984 and protesting the death of antifascist Günter Sare in 1985. At New Year in 1986, the Hafentage (Harbour Days) were organised by the Autonomen and Danish squatters from the BZ-movement attended. When several apartments were evicted, the squatters fought back by setting fires in 13 department stores. As well as housing activists, the building housed homeless people, youths, and refugees.

Hafenstraße became known nationally and even internationally. As well as being a local symbol against gentrification and for the right to the city, the project became a centre for left-wing social movements such as anti-nuclear and anti-imperialist protests. Resistance to eviction culminated in street battles before the end of the contract in 1986, when 12,000 people marched to defend the squats. Black bloc tactics developed in Germany around this time. A pirate radio station, Radio Hafenstraße, was set up and autonomen launched a coordinated arson attack on 13 department stores throughout the city, causing over $10,000,000 in damages. Hamburg intellectual Jan Philipp Reemtsma offered to buy the houses for the symbolic price of 1 DM from the Senate, but the offer was rejected. When negotiations failed in 1987, the squatters readied themselves for more fighting and the mayor, Klaus von Dohnanyi went against the feeling of his party (SPD) and offered to resolve the situation peacefully. In response, senator Alfons Pawelczyk mobilised thousands of police officers and the squatters built barricades. In November 1987, a contract was signed at the last minute and the barricades were dismantled again. Dohnanyi later received the Theodor Heuss medal for managing the conflict; he had previously described Hafenstraße as a &quot;wound in the city&quot; (&quot;eine Wunde in der Stadt&quot;). Indicating the international attention paid to the events in Hamburg, a &quot;New York Times&quot; article was written about Hafenstraße and entitled &quot;Squatters Win! (A Check book Did It)&quot;.

The Hamburg Higher Regional Court announced the contract was void in 1993, leading to more discussions. New mayor Henning Voscherau offered to fix the contract dispute if Hafenstrasse inhabitants agreed with nearby developments and social housing was built. In February 1995, the Hamburg Senate finally decided to sell the remaining houses to the inhabitants for around 2 million Deutsche Marks. The co-operative Alternativen am Elbufer (Alternatives beside the Elbe) then took on the ownership. In October 2007, a new house was built for 40 people at Bernhard-Nocht-Straße 26. In March 2019, a drugs raid resulted in 19 arrests.

== Murals ==
Hafenstraße has long been known for its murals, which are painted on the fronts or on the side of buildings next to empty lots. In 1987, the squatters painted the slogan &quot;Boycott &#x27;Israel&#x27;! Goods, kibbutzim, and beaches&quot;. Israel was written in apostrophes to emphasise its illegitimacy. The mural formed part of a broader campaign against the sale of Israeli goods in Hamburg which was endorsed by civil rights activists such as Uri Davis who saw Israel&#x27;s treatment of Palestinians in the same light as how South Africa treated its black population under apartheid. In 2018, a new mural in support of the Kurdish Women&#x27;s Protection Units (YPJ) was unveiled on one building.

== Legacy ==
In 1998, &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper referred to Hafenstraße as &quot;the most famous squat in the world&quot;. Bands such as Die Goldenen Zitronen emerged from the scene around the Hafenstraße. Rasmus Gerlach made two documentary films about the Hafenstraße: &quot;Die Hafentreppe&quot; (1991) and &quot;Hafenstraße im Fluss&quot; (2010). In 2010, he commented that &quot;it is the only attempt at utopia by the German left that has survived to this day&quot; (&quot;sie ist der einzige Utopie-Versuch der Bundesrepublikanischen Linken, der bis heute überlebt hat&quot;).

<text>A labradoodle () is a crossbreed dog created by crossing a Labrador Retriever and a Standard or Miniature Poodle. Labradoodles were intended to be a good choice for people allergic to canine dander.

The Australian Labradoodle Association, an organization run by labradoodle breeders, says they are &quot;generally considered healthy dogs&quot;. However, they also state that hip and elbow dysplasia are common problems affecting labradoodles. Other ailments include eye diseases and Addison&#x27;s disease. Wally Conron of Australia, who is credited with inventing the breed, has commented that healthy labradoodles are &quot;few and far between&quot; and most are &quot;crazy or have a hereditary problem&quot;.

== Breeding history ==
===Origins===
Australian breeder Wally Conron introduced the cross-breed to the Royal Guide Dog Association of Australia in Victoria. Conron hoped that the combination of the low-shedding coat of the poodle, along with the gentleness and trainability of a Labrador retriever, would provide a guide dog suitable for people with allergies to fur and dander. He hoped the catchy name and claims regarding allergies would offset the stigma associated with mixed breeds and thus help him sell his litter.

Sultan, a dog from this litter, displayed all the qualities Conron was seeking and worked as a guide dog for a woman in Hawaii for ten years.

Conron has since repeatedly stated that he regrets initiating the trend for this type of crossbreed and maintains it caused &quot;a lot of damage&quot; and &quot;a lot of problems&quot;, largely stemming from the genetic unpredictability of combining breeds. He felt he was to blame both for the spate of unethical breeders producing labradoodle puppy mills and for creating a &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, adding that problems were being bred into the dogs rather than selectively breeding away from problems and towards a recognizable standard. Conon is further quoted as claiming that &quot;for every perfect one, you&#x27;re going to find a lot of crazy ones.&quot;

===Follow-on guide-dog breeding programmes===

Currently, as with other mixed breeds, labradoodles are not considered a purebred or breed by the AKC and other major kennel club associations in North America and across the world. Technically, they are a hybrid of two pure breeds rather than a new breed. In 2010 the AKC began allowing owners of mixed breeds to register their dogs through an alternative listing programme to receive an AKC ID number.

Guide Dogs Victoria no longer breeds labradoodles, although they are bred by other guide and assistance dog organizations in Australia and elsewhere. The Association for the Blind of Western Australia has introduced labradoodles into their training programme. Their first, Jonnie, graduated in November 2010. Labradoodles are now widely used around the world as guide, assistance, and therapy dogs. They are also popular family dogs.

==Appearance and temperament==

Because the labradoodle is a cross between two dog breeds and not a breed itself, puppies in the early mixed generations do not have consistently predictable characteristics. The first crossing of a poodle with a labrador results in variations in appearance, size, coat, and temperament. So while most labradoodles share some common traits, their appearance and behavioural characteristics are widely variable.

Labradoodles&#x27; hair can be anywhere from wiry to soft, and may be straight, wavy, or curly. Labradoodles often display an affinity for water and strong swimming ability from their parent breeds. Like most Labrador retrievers and poodles, labradoodles are generally friendly, energetic, and good with families and children.

However, since this mix is a mix of two very smart dogs, they themselves are highly intelligent and likely to destroy or chew if not properly mentally and physically fulfilled.

==Types==

===Breeding line issues===
Others are breeding labradoodle to labradoodle over successive generations, and trying to establish a new dog breed. These dogs are usually referred to as &quot;multigenerational&quot; (multigen) labradoodles or multigeneration Australian labradoodles. 
===Australian labradoodle breeding programme===
Australian labradoodles also differ from labradoodles in general, in that they may also have other breeds in their ancestry. English and American cocker spaniel × poodle crosses (i.e. cockapoos). Two Irish water spaniels and soft-coated Wheaten Terriers were used in some Australian labradoodle lines. Curly Coated Retrievers were used too, but these lines were unsatisfactory and are no longer used for breeding. Disagreements within the programme have led to some groups continuing with different lines as in the case of the Australian Cobberdog.

===Coat texture and color===
Labradoodle coats are divided into three categories: wool, fleece, or hair.

Labradoodles&#x27; coat colors include chocolate, cafe, parchment, cream, gold, apricot, red, black, silver, chalk, lavender, and blue-ish gray. Coat patterns can be solid, white abstract markings, parti, phantom, or tri-coloured.
===Size===

Labradoodles can be different sizes, depending on the size of sire and dam used, and their size-names generally follow the names used for poodles: miniature, medium, and standard. Miniature labradoodles typically weigh around 18-28 lbs, medium around 26-45 pounds and standard can be from 45-75 lbs.

==Health==
Labradoodles can have problems common to their parent breeds. Poodles and Labrador retrievers can have hip dysplasia. The parent breeds can also have a number of eye disorders. There have also been cases of neurological disorders, including epilepsy.

===Joint dysplasia===
Elbow dysplasia is a known common issue in the parent breeds, similar to hip dysplasia. This issue becomes more prevalent as a result of rapid growth during the puppy stage.

===Congenital eye diseases===

One study has found that UK labradoodles have a higher incidence (4.6%) of multifocal retinal dysplasia (MRA) compared to Labrador retrievers. Cataracts are common as well (3.7%) but prevalence is comparable to that of Labradors.

===Addison&#x27;s disease===
There is evidence of some occurrence of Addison&#x27;s disease in the Australian labradoodle.

===Ear infections===
Labradoodles are very prone to ear infections due to their long floppy ears.

<text>The cockapoo, also known as a cockerpoo (portmanteau of &quot;cocker spaniel&quot; and &quot;poodle&quot;), is a dog crossbreed bred from the Cocker Spaniel and the Poodle, most commonly the Miniature Poodle.

==History==
The cockapoo was first bred as a designer dog in the United States with the aim of producing a healthy companion dog that, it is claimed by its supporters, does not inherit many of the health defects common in the two parent breeds due to hybrid vigor. If both parents are healthy this can be true and the crossbreed is typically more genetically diverse than purebred dogs; however, &quot;hybrid vigor&quot; indicates an increased probability of health rather than a definite one for any specific animal. Cocker Spaniels and Poodles have been deliberately crossed in the United States since the 1960s.

In 2022, cockapoos were one of the most expensive dog varieties in the United Kingdom, costing an average of . Between 2019 and 2020, the average price in the UK rose by 168 percent, a result of increased demand caused by a national lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Dimensions and appearance==

As with most animal crossbreeds, there is a great deal of variability in the cockapoo&#x27;s dimensions and appearance. All colors or combinations of colors can be found, though most commonly they are white and brown. The coat can also be straight, wavy, or curled. Individual dogs that weigh less than are labelled toy cockapoos, dogs that weigh between miniature cockapoos and dogs weighing over standard cockapoos. Cockapoos can vary in temperament and in need for exercise.

==Crossbreeding==
In order to promote the crossbreed in the United States, a dedicated club has been formed, the Cockapoo Club of America.

Cockapoos are available in F1, F2, and F2B, which is dependent on the parent dogs. An F1 cockapoo is bred from a purebred poodle and a cocker spaniel. This can also be called a first-generation cockapoo. When two F1 cockapoos are bred together this creates an F2 cockapoo, and there are many other combinations breeding back towards the original poodle or cocker spaniel breed.

== Temperament ==

Cockapoos are known for their affectionate nature and lively personalities, inheriting intelligence from both parents&#x27; breeds – the Cocker Spaniel and Poodle. This intelligence makes them generally easy to train, as they are eager learners and quick at mastering new tricks. It’s encouraged that owners enroll their cockapoos in puppy training classes for proper obedience and socialization. Cockapoos are energetic and require attention, exercise, and training to prevent boredom and potential recklessness. It&#x27;s important to note that, due to their sociable nature, if left alone for too long cockapoos have been known to develop separation anxiety.

== Health ==
Crossbreeds like cockapoos are generally healthy, and are known to have fewer predisposed health conditions compared to some purebred dogs. However, owners should be aware of common health concerns such as allergies, glaucoma, hip dysplasia, and progressive retinal issues.

<doc id="483149" wikidata="Q190723" url="?curid=483149" title="Gustavo Kuerten">
<text>Gustavo &quot;Guga&quot; Kuerten (; born 10 September 1976) is a Brazilian former professional tennis player. He was ranked as the world No. 1 in men&#x27;s singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals for 43 weeks, including as the year-end No. 1 in 2000. Kuerten won 20 ATP Tour-level singles titles, including three majors at the French Open in 1997, 2000, and 2001, as well as the 2000 Tennis Masters Cup. He also won eight doubles titles. Kuerten is regarded, alongside Maria Bueno, as one of the best Brazilian tennis players of all time. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2012. In 2016, Kuerten was a torch bearer for the Rio Olympics.

==Professional career==
As a junior player in South America, Kuerten won many of the most important tournaments in the region. He often played in an age group above his.

After two years as a professional, Kuerten rose to the position of No. 2 player in Brazil, behind Fernando Meligeni, and he had his then highest point by helping the Brazil Davis Cup team defeat Austria in 1996 and reach the competition&#x27;s first division, the World Group.

Following his unexpected victory in the 1997 French Open – which was not only his maiden ATP Tour victory but also the first time he had reached a professional ranking final – Kuerten had a difficult year and a half, adjusting to his sudden fame and the pressure of being expected to win. 1998 was the worst year in his career that was not related to injuries. The pressure for him to become an &quot;ambassador&quot; for tennis in Brazil was made evident after his early defeat to a then unknown Marat Safin in the 1998 French Open: the entire body of Brazilian journalists that had been dispatched to Paris to cover the event immediately returned home, leaving the rest of the tournament unaccounted for in Brazil.

Like many South American players, his favorite court surface is clay. He won three Grand Slam titles, all of them at the French Open, played on the red clay courts of Roland Garros. He won these titles in 1997, 2000 and 2001. In every one of the three French Open victories he defeated Russia&#x27;s Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the quarterfinals and two top 10 players on his way to the title. Kuerten became the world No. 1 player in 2000.

Kuerten won at least one title a year between 1997 and 2004. The streak came to an end in 2005, when injuries and below-average performances kept him from winning tournaments. He was also a regular participant for Brazil in the Davis Cup.

===1997: Entering the top 10===

Fresh from winning a Challenger title, Kuerten unexpectedly won the 1997 French Open, the first Brazilian to win a Grand Slam singles title since Maria Bueno at the 1966 U.S. Open. The tournament was only his third grand slam, setting a record for any player in the open era, tied with Mats Wilander. He remains the only player to win a Challenger and a Grand Slam in consecutive weeks. Victories over former champions of the previous four French Opens – Thomas Muster (1995) in the third round in five sets, Yevgeny Kafelnikov (1996) in the quarterfinals in five sets and Sergi Bruguera (1993, 1994) in the final – make him the third-lowest ranked Grand Slam Champion (ranked 66th), and his victory led to him entering the Association of Tennis Professionals top 20. Only Mark Edmondson (ranked 212th) and Goran Ivanišević (ranked 125th) were ranked lower than Kuerten when winning a Grand Slam singles title.

He received his French Open trophy from former champions Björn Borg and Guillermo Vilas. When called to the stage to receive the winner&#x27;s trophy, Kuerten reverently bowed a few times to his childhood idol Borg, who was waiting at the top of the stairs to shake his hand. Later, during the ceremony, Vilas whispered something in Kuerten&#x27;s ear that caused him to laugh during the speech of the chairman of the event. Kuerten later refused to reveal what it was that Vilas had said, claiming it would be inelegant to do so, but journalists that were equipped with powerful lenses were able to read Vilas&#x27;s lips, and it was revealed that he had said in Spanish something like: &quot;Get ready kid, it&#x27;s going to rain women on your lap!&quot;.

===1999: Top 5 debut===
He established himself as the leading clay court player of his generation in 1999, and he became one of three South Americans to complete the year in the top 10 in all the history of the ATP rankings. In April he won the Monte-Carlo Masters beating the Chilean Marcelo Ríos. In May he won the Rome Masters, beating Patrick Rafter in the final. In June he reached the quarterfinals at the French Open, losing to unseeded eventual runner-up Andriy Medvedev. At Wimbledon, he became the first Brazilian to reach the quarterfinals since Thomaz Koch in 1968. He was defeated by Andre Agassi in the quarterfinals, but had lost just one set until that stage. In July, he defeated Sébastien Grosjean 9–7 in the fifth set of the 1999 Davis Cup quarterfinal between Brazil and France. That match lasted 4 hours and 43 minutes. He also became the first Brazilian to qualify for the ATP Tennis Masters Cup, today known as the Nitto ATP Finals, winning a match but failing to get past round robin.

===2000: World No. 1===
After another solid clay court swing, Kuerten won his second French Open title by defeating Magnus Norman (who had beaten him a few weeks earlier in the final of the Rome Masters) on his 11th match point. Kuerten became the first South American to finish the year as World No. 1 in the history of the ATP rankings (since 1973). It was a close contest with young up-and-comer Marat Safin at the year&#x27;s last event, the Tennis Masters Cup (in its first year under that name) in Lisbon, Portugal, with one loss meaning that Safin would have been No. 1. Despite Safin having 4 chances to finish the year as world No. 1, Kuerten defied all odds and finished the year at No. 1 by beating Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi in back-to-back matches on an indoor hard court. He broke an eight-year hold of players from the U.S. on the year-end No. 1 position. He also became the first South American to finish in Top 5 in consecutive years since Guillermo Vilas of Argentina in 1977–78.

===2001: Continued dominance, start of injuries===
In 2001, he won his third French Open crown, joining former greats Björn Borg (6), Ivan Lendl (3) and Mats Wilander (3) with three or more French Open titles in the Open Era; former champion Jim Courier presented him with the trophy. His road to the title saw him save a match point against fourth round opponent Michael Russell. He also won the biggest hardcourt title of his career in August at the Cincinnati Masters, where he defeated Patrick Rafter in the final. At the US Open he was seeded first but lost in the quarterfinals in straight sets to seventh-seeded Yevgeni Kafelnikov.

Injuries started to plague Kuerten as he lost 8 of the next 9 matches to conclude the year. Despite being the favorite to finish as world No. 1 for the second consecutive year, his poor season ending showing saw Lleyton Hewitt overtake him. He led the ATP in prize money for the second straight year, with US$4,091,004.

===2004===
At the Australian Open Kuerten reached the third round for the first, and only, time in his career by defeating Ivan Ljubičić in the second round in four sets but subsequently lost to Paradorn Schrichapan. In an injury-ridden year, Kuerten won one ATP Tour title, which he did at home, by winning the Brasil Open for the second time. In that year, the tournament had been moved from September to February, and the surface had been changed from hard to clay, as a result of a compromise with the Buenos Aires Open, in Argentina, and the Viña del Mar Open, in Chile, to tighten up a clear South American tournament circuit. With his victory, Kuerten became the only player to win the title on both surfaces, having previously won it in 2002.

Kuerten was responsible for the only defeat of Roger Federer in a Grand Slam event in 2004. In Kuerten&#x27;s only previous encounter against Federer on clay, in the Hamburg Masters 2002, Federer defeated Kuerten 6–0, 1–6, 6–2. When they met again in the third round at the French Open in 2004, it was Federer who was in dominant form, the world no. 1, and expected to win against the injury-ridden Kuerten. Instead, it was Kuerten who overpowered and dominated Federer, beating him in straight sets. This would remain the last time that Federer was defeated in any Grand Slam prior to the quarterfinals stage until his round 2 loss against Serhiy Stakhovsky at Wimbledon in 2013.

On 1 September Kuerten announced that he would be withdrawing from the ATP Tour for an indefinite period of time, in order to undergo detailed exams of his operated hip, which had reportedly started to bother him again. He did not play again for the rest of the year.

===2006===
In the first months of 2006, injuries and weak performances kept Kuerten from reclaiming his status as a top world player. Ranked out of the top 200, Kuerten was no longer the top player in Brazil (currently behind Ricardo Mello and Flávio Saretta) and was expected to need wildcards to play any of the main tournaments of the season. His main attempt to come back, at the 2006 Brasil Open, was cut short in the first round. Following this debacle, Kuerten managed to obtain wildcards to play in the two North American Masters Series events, Miami and Indian Wells, but injuries forced Kuerten to withdraw from both. The French Tennis Federation had announced that Kuerten, as a three-time champion, would have every chance of being granted a wildcard to play at the 2006 French Open, provided that he managed to remain active throughout the 2006 season leading up to the French Open. Because Kuerten had been inactive in the Men&#x27;s Tour since mid-February, he was not granted the wildcard to play, thus missing the French Open for the first time in his professional career.

===2007===
Kuerten&#x27;s form did not improve in 2007. Because his ranking was not high enough to qualify for ATP Tour tournaments, Kuerten relied on wild cards to enter those events. Kuerten finished with a 2–7 win–loss record for the year. In November, Gustavo Kuerten&#x27;s younger brother, Guilherme, who had cerebral palsy, died.

=== 2008 ===
Kuerten made an announcement that he expected 2008 to be his final year of play. Kuerten chose to devise his schedule around tournaments that had sentimental value to him, such as the French Open, the Brasil Open, and the Miami Masters. After two first-round defeats in singles (Costa do Sauípe, l. to Berlocq and Miami, l. to Grosjean), Kuerten won his first ATP Masters Series level match in a long time, partnering Nicolás Lapentti, in Miami, against Feliciano López and Fernando Verdasco.

====Retirement====
On 25 May 2008, Gustavo Kuerten played his last professional singles match in front of 15,000 spectators at Roland Garros. He arrived on court wearing his &#x27;lucky&#x27; uniform, the same blue &amp; yellow one that he wore in 1997 when he won his first French Open tournament. Despite saving a match point against his opponent Paul-Henri Mathieu, he finally lost in three sets (6–3, 6–4, 6–2)—his result in the final of French Open in 1997. He was honored after the game by the tournament organizers and by all the fans present for what he has achieved throughout his career.

==Playing style==
Kuerten embraced the baseline style of play, with heavy topspin on his ground strokes and a solid serve that enabled him to wear down his opponents from the back of the court. Kuerten, however, emphasized offensive baseline play as opposed to the traditional defensive baseline play favoured by classic clay court specialists, and unlike them, his first serve was his biggest weapon. He played right-handed with a single-handed backhand using a western grip. The arcing backhand played with topspin was his trademark shot. He was one of the earliest adopters to play with polyester strings which allowed him to swing for pace and at the same time create the topspin needed to control the ball.

== Davis Cup ==
Kuerten was first called to play for Brazil in the Davis Cup in 1996, when he became the second-best ranked player in the country (to Fernando Meligeni). Since then, Kuerten has always answered the invitations to play, claiming that it was a unique opportunity to represent his country.

In the 1999 and 2000 seasons, Kuerten took criticism from his fans, who accused him of not giving 100% in the Davis Cup matches. They claimed he was more concerned with sparing his energy for the ATP tournaments. At one point, Kuerten interrupted a match to argue with a fan who had shouted out for him to apply himself to the match at hand.

In 2004, following the country&#x27;s unexpected defeat to Canada in the Repechage match, and the country&#x27;s demotion to the American Group I after having been defeated by Sweden in that year&#x27;s First Round, discontent with the politics of the Brazilian Tennis Confederation spilled over. Kuerten refused to play for Brazil in the American Group I. The unexpected firing of then captain of the Brazilian team, Ricardo Accioly, was the trigger. Kuerten thought it was an arbitrary decision, since it was made without consulting the players. In his view that was just the last in a sequence of questionable decisions made by organization&#x27;s board.

All other professional Brazilian players followed Kuerten&#x27;s lead, as well as the newly appointed captain, former player Jaime Oncins. As a result, Brazil had to play the first round in the Zonal Group with a team made up of junior players (which was only possible after much negotiation, during which time the country was at risk of forfeiting the Round, which would have resulted in automatic demoting to the American Group II), which resulted in a defeat and the possibility of demotion to the American Group II.

The protest continued, and as a result, Brazil had to play the Repechage match again with a junior team, and was demoted to the American Group II for the 2005 season. As of 2005, following the fall of the BTC board in the aftermath of the protest, Kuerten and the other players have decided to return to the team, now captained by former player Fernando Meligeni. Kuerten, however, had to delay his return beyond the end of the players&#x27; strike, since his hip injuries kept him off courts between September 2004 and May 2005. He returned in the Tie with the Netherlands Antilles, valid for the Second Round of the American Zonal Group II, which was played in Santa Catarina, Brazil (on clay) between July 15 and July 17, 2005.

==Equipment and sponsors==
During his career, Kuerten used Head racquets with Luxilon polyester strings. He wore Diadora clothes, changing them on a short period for Olympikus and Head. In 2012, after his retirement, he signed a sponsor deal with French brands Lacoste (for clothes) and Peugeot (for TV commercials). Kuerten also has his own clothes and glasses brand, named &quot;Guga Kuerten&quot;.

==Personal life==
Kuerten was born in Florianópolis in southern Brazil. He began playing tennis when he was six, an early start to a life and career marked by family tragedy. His father, Aldo, a former amateur tennis player, died of a heart attack in 1985 while umpiring a junior tennis match in Curitiba, when Kuerten was eight years old. His older brother, Raphael, is currently his business manager. His youngest brother, Guilherme, suffered prolonged oxygen deprivation and consequently irreparable brain damage during birth, and as a result suffered from cerebral palsey until his death in 2007. Kuerten was deeply affected by his brother&#x27;s daily struggles, later donating the entire prize money from one tournament he has won every year of his professional career so far to a hometown NGO that provides assistance for people suffering from similar disabilities. He gave every trophy he won to his younger brother as a souvenir, including the three miniature replicas of the French Open men&#x27;s singles trophy.

As a young player, Kuerten first learned from Carlos Alves. Alves would continue to coach Kuerten for the next 8 years. When he was 14 years old, Kuerten met Larri Passos who would be his coach for the following 15 years. Passos convinced Kuerten and his family that the youth was talented enough to make a living out of playing tennis. The two started traveling all over the world to participate in junior tournaments. Kuerten turned professional in 1995.

In 2000, he founded the Gustavo Kuerten Institute, a non-profit philanthropic association based in Florianópolis in support of children and disabled people.

Since retirement he has settled down in his place of birth, the Brazilian island of Florianópolis, where he is an active member in the lakeside district of Lagoa da Conceição. He still enjoys teaching and playing tennis with the local enthusiasts. In his hometown, he is known as the &quot;Cachorro Grande&quot; (&quot;Big Dog&quot;). He is an avid surfer.

Kuerten was accepted to a drama course at CEART, the Center of Arts of Santa Catarina State University (UDESC) in Florianópolis. He began his studies there on 16 February 2009.

In November 2010, on his brother Guilherme&#x27;s birthday, he married Mariana Soncini and the couple have a daughter and a son.

In October 2016 he was in court for tax evasion, related to income earned from copyright and image rights between 1995 and 2002, and in November was ordered to pay 7 million R$ (appr. US$2 million).

His favourite football team is Brazilian Avaí Futebol Clube. He is a distant cousin to model and TV presenter, Renata Kuerten.

==Awards and honors==
In 1998, 2002 and 2004 Kuerten received the Prix Orange Roland Garros Award for sportsmanship from the association of tennis journalists. In his homeland Brazil he was awarded the Prêmio Brasil Olímpico in 1999 and was named Athlete of the Year in 1999 and 2000. He received the ATP Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year Award in 2003. Kuerten was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2012. In June 2016 he became their global ambassador, representing the organisation, especially in South America. In 2005, &quot;Tennis Magazine&quot; put him in 37th place in its list of &quot;The 40 Greatest Players of the &quot;Tennis&quot; Era&quot;.

In 2010, Kuerten was presented with the ITF&#x27;s highest accolade, the Philippe Chatrier Award, for his contributions to tennis. That same year he won the Mercosur Konex Award from Argentina as the best tennis player of South America in that decade.

Kuerten won the International Club&#x27;s prestigious Jean Borotra Sportsmanship Award in 2011.

On 16 February 2016, the central court of Rio Open was named after him, officially Guga Kuerten court.

On 5 August 2016, he relayed the Olympic Torch into Maracanã Stadium during the Opening Ceremonies for 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, relaying off to Hortencia Marcari.

<text>Valery Pavlovich Chkalov (; ; – 15 December 1938) was a test pilot awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union (1936).

==Early life==
Chkalov was born to a Russian family in 1904 in the upper Volga region, the town of Vasilyevo (the town is now named Chkalovsk in his honour), which lies near Nizhny Novgorod.

He was the son of a ship boiler-maker at the Vasselyevo Ship Yard on the River Volga. His mother died when he was six years old. Chkalov studied in the technical school in Cherepovets but later returned to his home town to work as an apprentice in the shipyard alongside his father. He then got a job as a stoker on a river dredger: the &quot;Bayan&quot; (later renamed the &quot;Mikhail Kalinin&quot;).

He saw his first plane in 1919 and decided to join the Red Army&#x27;s air force, joining first at age 16 as a mechanic. He trained as a pilot at the Yegoryevsk Training School and graduated in 1924 joining a fighter squadron.

Chkalov married Olga Orekhova, a schoolteacher from Leningrad, in 1927. In the early 1930s he became a test pilot. His feats included doing 250 loop-the-loops in 45 minutes. His youngest daughter was a posthumous child.

==Achievements==
From 1935 he led the stunt section of the Soviet air force, used in public displays. This included the 1 May celebrations over Red Square at which point he met Stalin for the first time.

Chkalov achieved several milestones in aviation. In 1936 and 1937, he participated in several ultra long flights, including from Moscow, Soviet Union to Vancouver, Washington, United States &quot;via&quot; the North Pole in a Tupolev ANT-25 airplane (18–20 June 1937), a non-stop distance of . The flight pioneered the polar air route from Europe to the American Pacific Coast.

He was planning the world&#x27;s first non-stop flight around the planet when he died.


==Death==
Chkalov died on 15 December 1938 while piloting a prototype of the Polikarpov I-180 fighter, which crashed during its maiden test flight. The series of events leading up to the crash is not entirely clear. Neither of the aircraft&#x27;s two chief designers, Nikolai Polikarpov and Dmitry Tomashevich, approved the flight, and no one had signed a form releasing the prototype from the factory. In any case, Chkalov took off and made a low altitude circuit around the airfield. For the second circuit, Chkalov flew farther away, climbing to over 2,000 m (6,560 ft) even though the flight plan specifically forbade exceeding 600 m (1,970 ft). Chkalov apparently miscalculated his landing approach and came in short of the airfield, but when he attempted to correct his approach the engine cut out. Chkalov was able to avoid several buildings, but struck an overhead powerline. He was thrown from the cockpit, sustaining severe injuries, and died two hours later. His ashes are interred in the Kremlin Wall.

The official government investigation concluded that the engine cut out because it became too cold in the absence of the cowl flaps. Others hypothesised that Chkalov had advanced the throttle too fast and thus flooded the engine. As a result of the crash, Tomashevich and several other officials, who urged the first flight, were immediately arrested. Years later, fellow test pilot Mikhail Gromov blamed the designers for flawed engine cooling and Chkalov himself for deviating from the flight plan. Chkalov&#x27;s son claimed that a plan to assassinate his father had been in the works in the months preceding his death, but the circumstances of the crash make foul play unlikely. Despite the opinion of some, after Chkalov&#x27;s death Polikarpov&#x27;s reputation with Stalin was left intact, and Polikarpov continued to design aircraft.
==Commemoration==
The village of Vasilyevo where Chkalov was born is now the town of Chkalovsk (Nizhny Novgorod Oblast). The city of Orenburg bore the name Chkalov from 1938 to 1957. There was a Chkalov Street in Moscow (part of Moscow&#x27;s Garden Ring), now renamed Zemlyanoy Val; its namesakes in Nizhny Novgorod and several other Russian cities still exist. Nizhny Novgorod also has a staircase down to the Volga named after him with a statue of him at the top of it. In 1975, a monument to Chkalov&#x27;s 1937 polar flight was dedicated at Pearson Airpark in Vancouver, Washington and a street in east Vancouver was named Chkalov Drive.

A was named &quot;Chkalov&quot; but was renamed &quot;Komsomolets&quot; in 1958.

The metro rail systems of Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Nizhny Novgorod each have a &quot;Chkalovskaya&quot; station. Yekaterinburg Metro also opened one in 2012.

One of 16 Russia&#x27;s Tu-160 bombers was named after Valery Chkalov.

A musical duet, Отряд имени Валерия Чкалова (&quot;Detachment named after Valery Chkalov&quot;), recorded their first album in 1983.

A monument to Chkalov in Dnipro, Ukraine was dismantled in December 2022. The monument had been erected in 1981. Chkalov was not connected with Dnipro in any way. In February 2023 a monument to Chkalov in Kyiv, Ukraine was dismantled. It was dismantled as soon as the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy had revoked the monument cultural heritage site status. On 13 July 2023 Valery Chkalov Park in Kyiv was renamed Literature Park.

Moldova is also home to streets named after the pilot. One of them located in the city of Chișinău, is most well known for its comically short length of 41 meters making it the shortest street in the country. However at least 3 more streets all over the country bear the pilot&#x27;s name, from Găgăuzia to Lipcani and Iargara

<text>, also known by the abbreviations and SAS, are a Japanese rock band formed in Kanagawa in 1974.

The band is composed of Keisuke Kuwata (lead vocals and guitars), Yuko Hara (vocals and keyboards), Kazuyuki Sekiguchi (bass), (drums) and (percussion). In addition to the present lineup, former guitarist had worked in the band until 2001.

After the contract with Victor Entertainment, the band released their top ten charting debut single &quot;Katte ni Sindbad&quot; in 1978. Since then, Southern has been one of the best-selling music groups in Japan the past 30 years, selling more than 47 million albums and singles in Japan alone. They have had over 40 top ten hit singles and 16 No. 1 albums on the Japan&#x27;s Oricon Charts as of 2008.

Their 1998 compilation &quot;Umi no Yeah!!&quot; has sold more than 3.3 million copies and became the best-selling double album in Japanese history. Commercially their most successful song &quot;Tsunami&quot;, released in 2000, has sold over 2.9 million units in Japan alone, and provided the band with the honor of winning the 42nd Japan Record Awards. The band was also acclaimed and ranked No. 1 in HMV Japan&#x27;s 2003 list of &quot;100 most influential Japanese musicians&quot;. In 2007, &quot;Rolling Stone Japan&quot; ranked their album &quot;&quot; No. 32 on a list of the greatest Japanese rock albums of all time. They are also the only group to ever have 44 songs on the Oricon Top 100 weekly single chart simultaneously.

The band has occasionally gone into hiatus while individual members worked on solo and other projects and did so again between 2008 and 2013.

==History==

===Early years===
In 1974, a prototype of the band, composed of Aoyama Gakuin University students who belonged to the popular music club &quot;Better Days&quot;, was formed by Keisuke Kuwata. In their early days, the band changed its name frequently, such as &quot;Onsen Anma Momohiki Band&quot;, &quot;Piston Kuwata and the Cylinders&quot;, and &quot;Keisuke Kuwata and the Hitchcock Gekijou&quot;. Finally, when keyboardist Yuko Hara joined the group, they chose a permanent name. Named after the &quot;Fania All-Stars&quot; and &quot;Southern rock&quot; by Kuwata&#x27;s friend.

After several changes of members, they tried for &quot;Yamaha EastWest &#x27;77&quot;, the contest of amateur musicians by the Yamaha Music Foundation. At this contest, Kuwata won a prize for the &quot;best vocalist&quot;. When the band participated in this contest, Hiroshi Matsuda and Hideyuki Nozawa, two members who were not Aoyama Gakuin&#x27;s students joined them, and all the members of the group were then assembled.

On June 25, 1978, their debut single &quot;Katte ni Sindbad&quot; was released from Victor Entertainment. Its title was named after two hit songs in Japan in 1977, &quot;Katte ni Shiyagare&quot; by Kenji Sawada and &quot;Nagisa no Sindbad&quot; by Pink Lady In addition, the release date of their debut single was Sawada&#x27;s 29th birthday. The song featured Kuwata&#x27;s impressive coarse-grained vocals like a tongue twister. To promote their first single, they appeared on various TV programs. The weird costumes they dressed in and their eccentric performance made an unforgettable impact on listeners. Their single gradually climbed the charts and peaked at No. 3 on the Japan&#x27;s Oricon Singles Chart in autumn of the same year.

Because of the sales promotion of &quot;Katte ni Sindbad&quot; and the following single &quot;Kibun Shidai de Semenaide&quot;, they were considered performers of novelty songs. However, &quot;Itoshi no Ellie&quot;, their third single released on March 25, 1979, was sufficient to overturn their comedic public image. This pop-ballad was highly regarded by many Japanese music critics and artists, including Hiroshi Miyagawa and Kosetsu Minami. The song is regarded as one of the most notable songs by the Southern All Stars. In 1988, a cover version by Ray Charles was featured in a Suntory Limited TV advertisement. It was released as a single in Japan only, and reached No. 3 on the Oricon. The cover version by Charles became the best-selling single performed by a Western artist in 1989.

Two months after Southern released their debut single, their first album, &#x27;, was released. The band was not able to devote ample time to recording and songwriting for &#x27;, their second album. &quot;10 Numbers Carat&quot; featured their breakthrough ballad &quot;Itoshi no Ellie&quot;, which was released only eight months after their debut album. Kuwata&#x27;s angry look on the album cover mirrored his exhaustion. Hence, the leader of the band wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the quality of the album and has stated that the album was &quot;trash&quot;.

===The first half of the 1980s===
In 1980, the band started a serial project called &quot;Five Rock Show&quot; and released five singles every month. Due to a lack of sales promotion, each single succeeded only moderately. However, thanks to the success of their early singles in the late &#x27;70s, they had built up a solid fan base and high popularity on the album chart in Japan. Since &quot;&quot;, their third album released in 1980, all of their studio albums have reached the top consecutively. That album featured two songs featuring vocals by band members, Yuko Hara&#x27;s &quot;Watashi wa Piano&quot; and Matsuda&#x27;s &quot;Matsuda no Komoriuta&quot;. The former was covered by girl-pop singer Mizue Takada in the same year and became a top ten hit.

On January 24, 1982, the band released the single &quot;Chako no Kaigan Monogatari&quot;. Kuwata wanted a commercial hit and wrote this one more in the typical Japanese kayōkyoku style. In addition, as a vocalist, he imitated the lisping vocals of Toshihiko Tahara, one of the most popular Japanese male idol singers at that time. Such popular expression generally received favorable reaction from the public and became the band&#x27;s most successful single since &quot;Itoshi no Ellie&quot;. Following the success of the single, their fifth studio album, &quot;&quot;, was bigger than ever. The album reached No. 3 on Oricon&#x27;s 1982 year-end chart, and later became that year&#x27;s best-selling album. One of the highlights of &quot;Nude Man&quot;, &quot;Natsu o Akiramete&quot; was recorded by distinguished comedian and singer Naoko Ken the same year. Her cover version sold 300,000 copies and became one of her most successful works as a singer.

After the hit of &quot;Chako no Kaigan Monogatari&quot;, Kuwata married Hara on his 26th birthday. They invited their fans to their wedding ceremony.

Throughout Southern&#x27;s career, Kuwata has featured extremely erotic expressions in many of his self-written songs and the band&#x27;s sales promotions. &quot;I Love You wa Hitorigoto&quot;, Kuwata composition released as Hara&#x27;s first solo single in 1981, was banned due to suggestive lyrics including the term &quot;motel&quot;. The cover of the band&#x27;s 1983 single &quot;Body Special II&quot; featured the breast of a topless woman. Such explicit expression from Kuwata and his band&#x27;s music has continued to date.

In 1983 and 1984, two albums &#x27; and &#x27; were released. Both of these albums featured mainly adult-oriented rock rendition songs. With &quot;Miss Brand-New Day&quot;, a successful single and one of the highlights on &quot;Ninkimono de Ikō&quot;, the band gradually built up a definite reputation in the changeable Japanese music industry.

In 1985, the band released double studio album &quot;&quot;, which is now considered one of their best albums. To promote this blockbuster, extensive advertisement including an impressive TV commercial starring distinguished comedian Sanma Akashiya was used. Such large-scale promotion brought about rumors that the band might break up. In fact, in the process of recording, conflict arose between the Kuwata and Sekiguchi. It is said that they devoted over 1,800 hours to the recording of this album. The process did not always go smoothly, but the end product proved overwhelmingly successful. The album was highly praised by critics and listeners alike, and Kuwata was very satisfied with the favorable reception. In addition, Hara conceived his child the same year, so he suspended the group&#x27;s career temporarily. Around 1986, he began work on solo projects, including the . Other band members also began various solo projects.

===Projects with Takeshi Kobayashi===
&quot;Kanashii Kimochi (Just a Man in Love)&quot;, Keisuke Kuwata&#x27;s successful solo debut single released in 1987, was produced and arranged by Takeshi Kobayashi. Kobayashi started his career in the late &#x27;70s, and collaborated with numerous Japanese musicians, including Ryuichi Sakamoto, Yosui Inoue, Taeko Onuki, Hiroshi Takano and Kenji Omori. Through the recording of the solo material, Kuwata recognized Kobayashi&#x27;s abundant and practical ability, and decided to continue this strong combination for his career. In the late 1980s and the early 1990s, Kobayashi participated in many projects with Southern. Kuwata praised Kobayashi&#x27;s capability as a partner, and joked at a live performance, &quot;Even if he is unwilling to be part of my projects, I&#x27;ll force him to be involved in my career!&quot;

On June 25, 1988, ten years after Southern debuted, they returned to the Japanese music scene with a single &quot;Minna no Uta&quot; produced by Kobayashi. Their 1989 single &quot;Sayonara Baby&quot; reached the top on the Oricon Singles Chart, and it became their first No. 1 hit on that chart. That same year, a 4-CD box-set compilation entitled &quot;Suika&quot; was released. Regardless of its size/price, the album reached No. 1 and sold more than 300,000 units.

===1990s===
In the 1990s, the Japanese music industry prospered more than during other decades. Southern continued to enjoy commercial success and remained one of the mainstream groups of Japanese popular music throughout the 1990s.

In 1990, Southern released a , which became a million-seller.

That same year, Kuwata directed a film called &quot;Inamura Jane&quot;. The movie was not well-received, but the was very successful, reaching No. 1 on the Oricon Albums Chart and selling over 1 million copies, eventually becoming the best-selling Japanese soundtrack album of all time. &quot;Manatsu no Kajitsu&quot;, a song written by Kuwata, was released as the lead single from the album, and climbed to the top 5 on the charts. In 1991, Hong Kong singer Jacky Cheung covered the ballad in Chinese and enjoyed huge commercial success in several Asian countries. Dozens of other cover versions followed, from Asia to Europe; one of these is a Tagalog-language version sung by Donna Cruz, entitled &quot;Isang Tanong, Isang Sagot&quot;, released in 1997.

The soundtrack also included another highlight, &quot;Kibō no Wadachi&quot;. Having appeared on the album only, the song is well known as one of Southern&#x27;s most significant songs.

In 1991, Kazuyuki Sekiguchi left the band temporarily to overcome health problems, not returning until 1995. The next year, 1992, the remaining members released two singles &quot;Shulaba-La-Bamba&quot; and &quot;Namida no Kiss&quot; simultaneously. The latter marked the top of the Oricon Singles Chart for 7 weeks and sold more than 1.5 million copies. It was their first million-selling single and finally marked the top five on the Japanese Year-End singles chart for 1992. Two months from the release of those successful singles, their tenth studio album, &quot;&quot;, was released. At first, Kuwata planned to release it as a double album, but finally decided to omit some of the songs, including 1991 No. 1 hit single &quot;Neo Bravo!!&quot; The album has sold nearly 1.8 million copies.

In 1993, the remix EP &quot;Enoshima&quot; was released under the pseudonym project &quot;Z-Dan&quot;. It sold more than 900,000 copies and won the 8th Japan Gold Disc Award&#x27;s &quot;Compilation Album of the Year&quot; prize. The same year, the band released their second million-selling single &quot;Erotica Seven&quot;. The strong partnership between Kuwata and Kobayashi ended in the band&#x27;s holiday song released as a single &quot;Christmas Love&quot; in the autumn of that year. However, the two have collaborated from time to time after the temporary parting, such as Kuwata and Mr. Children&#x27;s successful charity single &quot;Kiseki no Hoshi&quot; released in 1995.

Throughout 1994, Kuwata worked as a solo artist again, and Southern released no new material. The next year, the band restarted with &quot;Mampy no G-Spot&quot;, an obscene song released as a single only. From this single, Sekiguchi, who had left the band in 1991, appeared again. &quot;Anatadake o -Summer Heartbreak-&quot;, the other song released in 1995 provided the group with their 3rd million-seller single. Later, Kuwata mentioned that &quot;Summer Heartbreak&quot; is one of his favorites. The next year, the band released two singles &quot;Ai no Kotodama -Spiritual Message-&quot; and &quot;Taiyō wa Tsumi na Yatsu&quot;, the former selling over million copies. &quot;&quot;, their 11th album, featured successful singles including two million-sellers, has sold more than 2.5 million copies to become one of the best-selling albums of 1996. It has remained the band&#x27;s most successful studio album to date.

=== &quot;Tsunami&quot; and Omori&#x27;s independence ===
On January 26, 2000, their 44th single, &quot;Tsunami&quot; was released. It was used as theme song of &quot;Mirai Nikki III&quot;, a popular part of the TBS program called &quot;Un-nan no Hontoko!&quot;, and made a strong impression on many people. The song reached No. 1 on the Oricon Singles Chart for five weeks, finally selling more than 2.9 million units. It is the third best-selling single in Japan of the last 40 years. On New Year&#x27;s Eve of 2000, &quot;Tsunami&quot; won the 42nd Japan Record Awards. After the enormous success of the single, the band became more conservative. They now release fewer singles and all of them have become hits.

After the concert tour in 2000, Takashi Omori announced a stop in work, and he left the band in August 2001. Omori and his wife were well known as pious and influential Soka Gakkai adherents. This caused various rumors in the press about religious problems between himself and other members and many fans.

By the early 2000s, each member had actively pursued solo projects. Particularly, Kuwata produced three million-selling records and one album around 2001 and 2002.

===Recent years===
In October 2005, their latest double-album &quot;&quot; was released. The album debuted at No. 1 in Japan and has sold over a million units to date. Southern will release their sixteenth album, &quot;Thank You So Much&quot;, in March 2025.

<text>Anemia is a genus of ferns. It is the only genus in the family Anemiaceae in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Alternatively, the genus may be placed as the only genus in the subfamily Anemioideae of a more broadly defined family Schizaeaceae, the family placement used in &quot;Plants of the World Online&quot; . Its species are sometimes called flowering ferns, but this term is more commonly applied to ferns of the genus &quot;Osmunda&quot;. Fronds are dimorphic; in fertile fronds, the two lowermost pinnae are highly modified to bear the sporangia.

Ferns in this genus have chromosome numbers based on &quot;x&quot;=38: &quot;n&quot;=38, 76, 114.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Anemia&quot; was first described by the Swedish botanist Olof Swartz in 1806. The family Anemiaceae was created by Johann Link in 1841. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), &quot;Anemia&quot; includes &quot;Mohria&quot; and &quot;Colina&quot; and is the only genus in the family. Some sources do not separate the family Anemiaceae from Schizaeaceae.

<text>Orenburg (, ), formerly known as Chkalov (1938–1957), is the administrative center of Orenburg Oblast, Russia. It lies in Eastern Europe, along the banks of the Ural River, being approximately southeast of Moscow.

Orenburg is close to the border with Kazakhstan. It was the capital of the Kazakh ASSR from 1920 to 1925.

==Etymology==

Several historians have tried to explain the origins of the city&#x27;s name. It was traditionally accepted that the word &quot;orenburg&quot; means a fortress on the River Or. In all probability, the word combination &quot;orenburg&quot; was proposed by , the founder of the city. In 1734, in accordance with his project, a package of governmental documents was worked out. This was the starting point for Orenburg as a fortress city near the meeting of the Or and Ural rivers.

On 7 June 1734, &quot;A Privilege for Orenburg&quot; (tsar&#x27;s edict) was ordered by Empress Anna Ioannovna.

While the construction site of the main fortress changed many times (down the River Ural), the name &quot;Orenburg&quot; has not changed since its founding in 1743. Between 1938 and 1957, the city was referred to as Chkalov, named after the famous Soviet pilot Valery Chkalov, although he was not born in and never lived in Orenburg, and never visited Orenburg. In 1954, Chkalov&#x27;s five-meter bronze sculpture was erected on the occasion of his 50th birth anniversary; this was installed on a seven-meter pedestal on the Boulevard (the riverside promenade of the city, commonly named &quot;Belovka&quot;).

==History==
In 1734, the Russian Empire began to expand its dominance and influence in Asia by building a fortified city called Orenburg on its eastern border (Southern Urals). For this purpose, in 1735, Ivan Kirilov, a cartographer and statistician, began to develop the settlement at the confluence of the rivers Or and Ural, and the first settlement was chosen during his expedition. He claimed that the town was needed &quot;to open a transit route to Bukhara, Badakhshan, Balkh and India&quot; and that &quot;riches in the form of gold, lapis lazuli and garnets could be obtained from it&quot;. After his death, a new manager of the Orenburg expedition, Vasily Tatishchev, was appointed who did not consider the place suitable for building a city. Therefore, in 1739 he began preparations for the construction of a new town with the old name on Krasnaya Gora (Red Mountain), downstream of the Ural (Yaik)River. The old settlement was named the Orsk fortress (now the city of Orsk).

On August 6, 1741, the new town was laid out. However, its construction never started. The place on Krasnaya Gora was not suitable for the construction of the city, as it was treeless, rocky and far from the river. A new manager of the Orenburg expedition Ivan Neplyuev was appointed, and on April 19, 1743, Orenburg was built up on the third attempt, at the place where the Berd settlement was earlier located, 75 km (46miles) from the Krasnaya Gora. In the summer of 1742, Neplyuev was assigned to build the city on the site of the rivers Yaik and Sakmara. The new place, surrounded by forests and fields where the Yaik and Sakumara rivers converge, was chosen by Neplyuev himself. Today it is the historical center of the city. The town built on the Red Mountain was named Krasnogorsk. Thus, in 1743 Ivan Neplyuev founded Orenburg on thesite of present-day Orsk, about 250 kilometers west of the Urals. This third Orenburg served as an important military outpost on the border with the nomadic Kazakhs. It became the center of the Orenburg Cossacks. In the first half of the 18th century, the Russian Empire constructed the , a series of forty-six forts, including Orenburg, to prevent Kazakh and Dzungar raids into Russian territory. 

Orenburg played a major role in Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion (1773–1774), the largest peasant revolt in Russian history. At the time, it was the capital of a vast district and the seat of the governor. Yemelyan Pugachev besieged the city and its fortress from nearby Berda from October 1773 to March 26, 1774. The defense was organized by Governor of Orenburg lieutenant-general Reinsdorf.
General Golytsin defeated Pugachev at Berda, and later again at Kargala (north of Orenburg). Most of the city was left in ruins, and thousands of inhabitants had died in the siege. Government forces crushed revolt towards the end of 1774 by General Michelsohn at Tsaritsyn. Further reprisals against rebel areas were carried out by General Peter Panin.

Alexander Pushkin visited Orenburg in 1833 during a research trip for his books &quot;The History of Pugachev&quot; and his famous novel &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. He met his friend Vladimir Dal here, who would later write the first serious dictionary of the Russian language.

Orenburg was the base for General Perovsky&#x27;s expeditions against the Khanate of Khiva in the 1830s through 1850s. After the incorporation of Central Asia into the Russian Empire, Orenburg became a trading station and, since the completion of the Trans-Aral Railway, a prominent railway junction en route to the new Central Asian possessions and to Siberia.

Orenburg functioned as the capital of the Kirghiz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (in present-day Kazakhstan) within Russia from 1920 to 1925. When that republic was renamed Kazakh Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic in 1925, Orenburg joined Russia and Kyzylorda became the new capital. Almaty became the capital in 1929 after the construction of the Turkestan–Siberia Railway. Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was promoted to union republic status as the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic Kazakh SSR in 1936. Orenburg remained in Russia. From 1938 to 1957, the city bore the name Chkalov () (after the prominent test pilot Valery Chkalov). The city&#x27;s distance from the German invasion during World War II led many Soviet enterprises to flee there, helping to spur the city&#x27;s economic growth.

== Administrative and municipal status ==
Orenburg is the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative centre of Orenburgsky District, even though it is not a part of it.

City public transport includes bus, trolleybus and also &quot;marshrutkas&quot; (fixed-route cabs).

<text>A nuclear-powered icebreaker is an icebreaker with an onboard nuclear power plant that produces power for the vessel&#x27;s propulsion system. Although more expensive to operate, nuclear-powered icebreakers provide a number of advantages over their diesel-powered counterparts, especially along the Northern Sea Route where diesel-powered icebreaker operations are challenging due to the heavy power demand associated with icebreaking, limited refueling infrastructure along the Siberian coast, and the endurance required. , Russia is the only country that builds and operates nuclear-powered icebreakers, having built a number of such vessels to aid shipping along the Northern Sea Route and Russian arctic outposts since the Soviet era.

== History of nuclear-powered icebreakers ==

The first nuclear icebreaker was the Soviet vessel &quot;Lenin&quot;, which was launched in 1957 as the world’s first nuclear-powered surface vessel and the first civilian-operated nuclear vessel. An experimental nuclear-powered vessel, &quot;Lenin&quot; began icebreaking service along the Northern Sea Route in 1959 and continued to do so until 1989. From 1967 to 1971 &quot;Lenin&quot; was refurbished, with new capabilities developed in the process. 

The second-generation nuclear-powered icebreakers, &quot;Arktika&quot; class (Project 10520 and 10521), utilized an improved reactor design and turbo-electric propulsion train to deliver significantly improved icebreaking performance, allowing the vessels to provide year-round icebreaking service along the Northern Sea Route and conduct voyages into the Arctic Ocean.

As natural gas exploration increased along the Siberian coast, the Murmansk Shipping Company (MSCO) found that the existing &quot;Arktika&quot;-class were challenging to operate within the shallow coastal deltas. To fill this capability gap, they ordered two slightly smaller shallow-draught icebreakers from Wärtsilä Marine Helsinki Shipyard in Finland and installed their nuclear powerplants at Baltic Shipbuilding in Leningrad (today St. Petersburg).

In the late 1980s, the Central Design Bureau &quot;Iceberg&quot; began designing a replacement for the &quot;Arktika-&quot; and &quot;Taymyr&quot; classes. The program called for a series of icebreaker designs ranging from smaller diesel-powered auxiliary icebreakers to two nuclear-powered icebreaker types, 60-megawatt &quot;line icebreaker&quot; (LK-60Ya) and 110-megawatt &quot;icebreaker-leader&quot; (LK-110Ya).

The LK-60Ya was realized as Project 22220, the first of which was laid down in 2013 and commissioned in 2020. Although similar in size and propulsion power to the preceding &quot;Arktika&quot;-class, Project 22220 is a dual-draft vessel capable of operating at shallower draft, allowing it to perform roles of both &quot;Arktika&quot;- and &quot;Taymyr&quot; classes. The first LK-110Ya-type icebreaker, realized as Project 10510, was laid down in 2021. When completed, the lead vessel &quot;Rossiya&quot; will be the largest nuclear icebreaker in the world.

Although Russia has historically been the only country to build and operate nuclear-powered icebreakers, several other countries have expressed interest in doing so. In 2019, China announced plans that it would build a nuclear-powered icebreaker similar to the Russian Project 22220. , construction on this proposed nuclear icebreaker has not commenced.

== Use of nuclear-powered icebreakers ==

=== Commercial icebreaking ===

The Northern Sea Route runs along the Siberian coast from the principal ports of Murmansk to Petropavlovsk and Vladivostok. The route includes sections of the Barents Sea, the Pechora Sea, the Kara Sea, the Laptev Sea, and the Eastern Siberian Sea to the Bering Strait. It provides the only feasible means to deliver heavy equipment, such as natural gas production modules or military vehicles, to communities along the Siberian coast and the Russian Arctic islands. Key ports served along the Siberian coast are Dikson, Tiksi, Pevek, and the Yamal Peninsula.

During the winter, the ice along the Northern Sea Route varies in thickness from . The ice in central parts of the Arctic Ocean is on average thick. Nuclear-powered icebreakers can force through this ice at speeds up to . In ice-free waters, the maximum speed of the nuclear-powered icebreakers is as much as .

Two types of nuclear-powered icebreakers are used along the Northern Sea Route: the heavy &quot;Arktika&quot;-class and shallow draft &quot;Taymyr&quot;-class. With a draft of the &quot;Arktika&quot;-class vessels are unable to navigate the shallow river deltas leading to several key Siberian ports. The smaller &quot;Taymyr&quot;-class provides icebreaking service in these regions, particularly the Yenisei River to Dikson.

=== Scientific exploration ===
The icebreakers have also been used for a number of scientific expeditions in the Arctic. On August 17, 1977, was the first surface vessel in the world to reach the North Pole.

=== Arctic tourism ===

Since 1989 the &quot;Arktika&quot;-class nuclear-powered icebreakers have also been used to ferry tourists to the North Pole. Each participant pays up to US$25,000 for a cruise lasting three weeks. &quot;Sibir&quot; was used for the first two tourist cruises in 1989 and 1990. In 1991 and 1992, the tourist trips to the North Pole were undertaken by &quot;Sovetskiy Soyuz&quot;. During the summer of 1993, &quot;Yamal&quot; was used for three tourist expeditions in the Arctic. The last two vessel of the &quot;Arktika&quot;-class (&quot;Yamal&quot; and &quot;50 Let Pobedy&quot;) contain a separate accommodation section for tourists.

Quark Expeditions chartered &quot;50 Let Pobedy&quot; for expeditions to the North Pole in 2008. The vessel&#x27;s maiden voyage to the North Pole embarked in Murmansk, on June 24, 2008. The ship carried 128 guests in 64 cabins in five categories. &quot;50 Let Pobedy&quot; completed a total of three expeditions to the North Pole in 2008 for the polar adventure company. and offering it for a North Pole cruise.

== Nuclear-powered icebreaker classes ==

=== Russian nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet ===
Russia&#x27;s nuclear-powered icebreaking fleet is owned by the federal government. Initially, the icebreakers were operated by the Murmansk Shipping Company (MSCO); however, in 2008 they were transferred to the state-owned corporation Rosatom and operated by the subsidiary Atomflot. Rosatom is also responsible for the safe navigation of vessels along the Northern Sea Route.

==== Icebreakers ====

* &quot;Lenin&quot;: an experimental 16,000 tonne, 134 meter long icebreaker commissioned in 1957. The Lenin was initially powered by three OK-150 (90MWt) nuclear reactors, which were replaced with two OK-900 (171MWt) reactors in 1971. &quot;Lenin&quot; was decommissioned in 1989 and has since been converted to a museum ship in its former homeport of Murmansk.

<doc id="483173" wikidata="Q2625091" url="?curid=483173" title="Branch point">
<text>In the mathematical field of complex analysis, a branch point of a multivalued function is a point such that if the function is formula_1-valued (has formula_1 values) at that point, all of its neighborhoods contain a point that has more than formula_1 values. Multi-valued functions are rigorously studied using Riemann surfaces, and the formal definition of branch points employs this concept.

Branch points fall into three broad categories: algebraic branch points, transcendental branch points, and logarithmic branch points. Algebraic branch points most commonly arise from functions in which there is an ambiguity in the extraction of a root, such as solving the equation formula_4 for formula_5 as a function of formula_6. Here the branch point is the origin, because the analytic continuation of any solution around a closed loop containing the origin will result in a different function: there is non-trivial monodromy. Despite the algebraic branch point, the function formula_5 is well-defined as a multiple-valued function and, in an appropriate sense, is continuous at the origin. This is in contrast to transcendental and logarithmic branch points, that is, points at which a multiple-valued function has nontrivial monodromy and an essential singularity. In geometric function theory, unqualified use of the term &quot;branch point&quot; typically means the former more restrictive kind: the algebraic branch points. In other areas of complex analysis, the unqualified term may also refer to the more general branch points of transcendental type.

==Algebraic branch points==

Let formula_8 be a connected open set in the complex plane formula_9 and formula_10 a holomorphic function. If formula_11 is not constant, then the set of the critical points of formula_11, that is, the zeros of the derivative formula_13, has no limit point in formula_8. So each critical point formula_15 of formula_11 lies at the center of a disc formula_17 containing no other critical point of formula_11 in its closure.

Let formula_19 be the boundary of formula_17, taken with its positive orientation. The winding number of formula_21 with respect to the point formula_22 is a positive integer called the ramification index of formula_15. If the ramification index is greater than 1, then formula_15 is called a ramification point of formula_11, and the corresponding critical value formula_22 is called an (algebraic) branch point. Equivalently, formula_15 is a ramification point if there exists a holomorphic function formula_28 defined in a neighborhood of formula_15 such that formula_30 for integer formula_31.

Typically, one is not interested in formula_11 itself, but in its inverse function. However, the inverse of a holomorphic function in the neighborhood of a ramification point does not properly exist, and so one is forced to define it in a multiple-valued sense as a global analytic function. It is common to abuse language and refer to a branch point formula_33 of formula_11 as a branch point of the global analytic function formula_35. More general definitions of branch points are possible for other kinds of multiple-valued global analytic functions, such as those that are defined implicitly. A unifying framework for dealing with such examples is supplied in the language of Riemann surfaces below. In particular, in this more general picture, poles of order greater than 1 can also be considered ramification points.

In terms of the inverse global analytic function formula_35, branch points are those points around which there is nontrivial monodromy. For example, the function formula_37 has a ramification point at formula_38. The inverse function is the square root formula_39, which has a branch point at formula_40. Indeed, going around the closed loop formula_41, one starts at formula_42 and formula_43. But after going around the loop to formula_44, one has formula_45. Thus there is monodromy around this loop enclosing the origin.

==Transcendental and logarithmic branch points==
Suppose that &quot;g&quot; is a global analytic function defined on a punctured disc around &quot;z&quot;0. Then &quot;g&quot; has a transcendental branch point if &quot;z&quot;0 is an essential singularity of &quot;g&quot; such that analytic continuation of a function element once around some simple closed curve surrounding the point &quot;z&quot;0 produces a different function element. 

An example of a transcendental branch point is the origin for the multi-valued function

:formula_46

for some integer &quot;k&quot; &gt; 1. Here the monodromy group for a circuit around the origin is finite. Analytic continuation around &quot;k&quot; full circuits brings the function back to the original.

If the monodromy group is infinite, that is, it is impossible to return to the original function element by analytic continuation along a curve with nonzero winding number about &quot;z&quot;0, then the point &quot;z&quot;0 is called a logarithmic branch point. This is so called because the typical example of this phenomenon is the branch point of the complex logarithm at the origin. Going once counterclockwise around a simple closed curve encircling the origin, the complex logarithm is incremented by 2&quot;i&quot;. Encircling a loop with winding number &quot;w&quot;, the logarithm is incremented by 2&quot;i w&quot; and the monodromy group is the infinite cyclic group formula_47.

Logarithmic branch points are special cases of transcendental branch points.

There is no corresponding notion of ramification for transcendental and logarithmic branch points since the associated covering Riemann surface cannot be analytically continued to a cover of the branch point itself. Such covers are therefore always unramified.

==Examples==

* 0 is a branch point of the square root function. Suppose &quot;w&quot; = &quot;z&quot;1/2, and &quot;z&quot; starts at 4 and moves along a circle of radius 4 in the complex plane centered at 0. The dependent variable &quot;w&quot; changes while depending on &quot;z&quot; in a continuous manner. When &quot;z&quot; has made one full circle, going from 4 back to 4 again, &quot;w&quot; will have made one half-circle, going from the positive square root of 4, i.e., from 2, to the negative square root of 4, i.e., −2.
* 0 is also a branch point of the natural logarithm. Since &quot;e&quot;0 is the same as &quot;e&quot;2&quot;i&quot;, both 0 and 2&quot;i&quot; are among the multiple values of ln(1). As &quot;z&quot; moves along a circle of radius 1 centered at 0, &quot;w&quot; = ln(&quot;z&quot;) goes from 0 to 2&quot;i&quot;.
* In trigonometry, since tan(/4) and tan (5/4) are both equal to 1, the two numbers /4 and 5/4 are among the multiple values of arctan(1). The imaginary units &quot;i&quot; and −&quot;i&quot; are branch points of the arctangent function arctan(&quot;z&quot;) = (1/2&quot;i&quot;)log[(&quot;i&quot; − &quot;z&quot;)/(&quot;i&quot; + &quot;z&quot;)]. This may be seen by observing that the derivative (&quot;d&quot;/&quot;dz&quot;) arctan(&quot;z&quot;) = 1/(1 + &quot;z&quot;2) has simple poles at those two points, since the denominator is zero at those points.
* If the derivative &quot;ƒ&quot; &#x27; of a function &quot;ƒ &quot; has a simple pole at a point &quot;a&quot;, then &quot;ƒ&quot; has a logarithmic branch point at &quot;a&quot;. The converse is not true, since the function &quot;ƒ&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) = &quot;z&quot;α for irrational α has a logarithmic branch point, and its derivative is singular without being a pole.

== Branch cuts ==
Roughly speaking, branch points are the points where the various sheets of a multiple valued function come together. The branches of the function are the various sheets of the function. For example, the function &quot;w&quot; = &quot;z&quot;1/2 has two branches: one where the square root comes in with a plus sign, and the other with a minus sign. A branch cut is a curve in the complex plane such that it is possible to define a single analytic branch of a multi-valued function on the plane minus that curve. Branch cuts are usually, but not always, taken between pairs of branch points.

Branch cuts allow one to work with a collection of single-valued functions, &quot;glued&quot; together along the branch cut instead of a multivalued function. For example, to make the function

:formula_48

single-valued, one makes a branch cut along the interval [0, 1] on the real axis, connecting the two branch points of the function. The same idea can be applied to the function ; but in that case one has to perceive that the &quot;point at infinity&quot; is the appropriate &#x27;other&#x27; branch point to connect to from 0, for example along the whole negative real axis.

The branch cut device may appear arbitrary (and it is); but it is very useful, for example in the theory of special functions. An invariant explanation of the branch phenomenon is developed in Riemann surface theory (of which it is historically the origin), and more generally in the ramification and monodromy theory of algebraic functions and differential equations.

=== Complex logarithm ===
The typical example of a branch cut is the complex logarithm. If a complex number is represented in polar form &quot;z&quot; = &quot;r&quot;ei&quot;θ&quot;, then the logarithm of &quot;z&quot; is
:formula_49
However, there is an obvious ambiguity in defining the angle &quot;θ&quot;: adding to &quot;θ&quot; any integer multiple of 2 will yield another possible angle. A branch of the logarithm is a continuous function &quot;L&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) giving a logarithm of &quot;z&quot; for all &quot;z&quot; in a connected open set in the complex plane. In particular, a branch of the logarithm exists in the complement of any ray from the origin to infinity: a &quot;branch cut&quot;. A common choice of branch cut is the negative real axis, although the choice is largely a matter of convenience.

The logarithm has a jump discontinuity of 2i when crossing the branch cut. The logarithm can be made continuous by gluing together countably many copies, called &quot;sheets&quot;, of the complex plane along the branch cut. On each sheet, the value of the log differs from its principal value by a multiple of 2i. These surfaces are glued to each other along the branch cut in the unique way to make the logarithm continuous. Each time the variable goes around the origin, the logarithm moves to a different branch.

=== Continuum of poles ===

One reason that branch cuts are common features of complex analysis is that a branch cut can be thought of as a sum of infinitely many poles arranged along a line in the complex plane with infinitesimal residues. For example,

: formula_50

is a function with a simple pole at &quot;z&quot; = &quot;a&quot;. Integrating over the location of the pole:

: formula_51

defines a function &quot;u&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) with a cut from −1 to 1. The branch cut can be moved around, since the integration line can be shifted without altering the value of the integral so long as the line does not pass across the point &quot;z&quot;.

==Riemann surfaces==
The concept of a branch point is defined for a holomorphic function ƒ:&quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; from a compact connected Riemann surface &quot;X&quot; to a compact Riemann surface &quot;Y&quot; (usually the Riemann sphere). Unless it is constant, the function ƒ will be a covering map onto its image at all but a finite number of points. The points of &quot;X&quot; where ƒ fails to be a cover are the ramification points of ƒ, and the image of a ramification point under ƒ is called a branch point.

For any point &quot;P&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; = ƒ(&quot;P&quot;) ∈ &quot;Y&quot;, there are holomorphic local coordinates &quot;z&quot; for &quot;X&quot; near &quot;P&quot; and &quot;w&quot; for &quot;Y&quot; near &quot;Q&quot; in terms of which the function ƒ(&quot;z&quot;) is given by
:formula_52
for some integer &quot;k&quot;. This integer is called the ramification index of &quot;P&quot;. Usually the ramification index is one. But if the ramification index is not equal to one, then &quot;P&quot; is by definition a ramification point, and &quot;Q&quot; is a branch point.

If &quot;Y&quot; is just the Riemann sphere, and &quot;Q&quot; is in the finite part of &quot;Y&quot;, then there is no need to select special coordinates. The ramification index can be calculated explicitly from Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula. Let γ be a simple rectifiable loop in &quot;X&quot; around &quot;P&quot;. The ramification index of ƒ at &quot;P&quot; is
:formula_53
This integral is the number of times ƒ(γ) winds around the point &quot;Q&quot;. As above, &quot;P&quot; is a ramification point and &quot;Q&quot; is a branch point if &quot;e&quot;&quot;P&quot; &gt; 1.

==Algebraic geometry==
In the context of algebraic geometry, the notion of branch points can be generalized to mappings between arbitrary algebraic curves. Let ƒ:&quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; be a morphism of algebraic curves. By pulling back rational functions on &quot;Y&quot; to rational functions on &quot;X&quot;, &quot;K&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is a field extension of &quot;K&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;). The degree of ƒ is defined to be the degree of this field extension [&quot;K&quot;(&quot;X&quot;):&quot;K&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;)], and ƒ is said to be finite if the degree is finite.

Assume that ƒ is finite. For a point &quot;P&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;, the ramification index &quot;e&quot;&quot;P&quot; is defined as follows. Let &quot;Q&quot; = ƒ(&quot;P&quot;) and let &quot;t&quot; be a local uniformizing parameter at &quot;P&quot;; that is, &quot;t&quot; is a regular function defined in a neighborhood of &quot;Q&quot; with &quot;t&quot;(&quot;Q&quot;) = 0 whose differential is nonzero. Pulling back &quot;t&quot; by ƒ defines a regular function on &quot;X&quot;. Then
:formula_54
where &quot;v&quot;&quot;P&quot; is the valuation in the local ring of regular functions at &quot;P&quot;. That is, &quot;e&quot;&quot;P&quot; is the order to which formula_55 vanishes at &quot;P&quot;. If &quot;e&quot;&quot;P&quot; &gt; 1, then ƒ is said to be ramified at &quot;P&quot;. In that case, &quot;Q&quot; is called a branch point.

<text>The Thomson Corporation was one of the world&#x27;s largest information companies. It was established in 1989 following a merger between International Thomson Organization and Thomson Newspapers. In 2008, it purchased Reuters Group to form Thomson Reuters. The Thomson Corporation was active in financial services, healthcare sectors, law, science and technology research, as well as tax and accounting sectors. The company operated through five segments (2007 onwards): Thomson Financial, Thomson Healthcare, Thomson Legal, Thomson Scientific and Thomson Tax &amp; Accounting.

Until 2007, Thomson was also a major worldwide provider of higher education textbooks, academic information solutions and reference materials. On 26 October 2006, Thomson announced the proposed sale of its Thomson Learning assets. In May 2007, Thomson Learning was acquired by Apax Partners and subsequently renamed Cengage Learning in July. The Thomson Learning brand was used to the end of August 2007.

Subsequently, on 15 October 2007, Educational Testing Service (ETS) finalized acquisition of Thomson&#x27;s Prometric. Thomson sold its global network of testing centres in 135 countries, for a reported $435 million. Prometric now operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of ETS.

On 15 May 2007, the Thomson Corporation reached an agreement with Reuters to combine the two companies, a deal valued at $17.2 billion. On 17 April 2008, the new company was created under the name of Thomson Reuters. The chief executive officer of Thomson Reuters is Jim Smith, and the chairman is David Thomson, formerly of the Thomson Corporation. Although it was officially a Canadian company and remained Canadian owned, Thomson was run from its operational headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, in the United States.

==History==
The Thomson Corporation grew from a single Canadian newspaper, the &quot;Timmins Daily Press&quot;, acquired in 1934 by Roy Thomson (later to become 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet), into a global media concern. Thomson acquired his first non-Canadian newspaper, the &quot;Independent&quot; of St. Petersburg, Florida, in 1952. He was told by the UK Government that to qualify for a peerage, in keeping with other press barons in London, he would have to reside in the UK. 
Accordingly, he moved to Edinburgh and invited newspaper owners to sell to him. In this expansion in the United Kingdom the first to come forward and be bought was &quot;The Scotsman&quot; in 1953. He had no experience of television but saw the profits it made in the US and successfully founded Scottish Television in 1957, locating its headquarters and studios in the Theatre Royal, Glasgow. He founded the Thomson Organization in 1959. In the 1960s, Thomson&#x27;s UK publishing realm expanded to include Thomson Publication (UK), a consumer magazine and book publishing house, and &quot;The Times&quot;. In 1965, Thomson Newspapers, Ltd. was formed as a publicly traded company in Canada.

Roy Thomson&#x27;s prolific endeavours in publishing earned him the hereditary title Lord Thomson of Fleet in 1964. Thomson&#x27;s interests moved beyond publishing with the creation of Thomson Travel and acquisition of Britannia Airways in 1965 and 1971, and a foray into a consortium exploring the North Sea for oil and gas. Thomson used its oil profits to buy small newspapers in the United States, starting with the acquisition of Brush-Moore Newspapers in 1967 for $72 million, at the time the largest sale of newspapers. By the end of the 1970s, Thomson Newspapers&#x27; circulation in the United States had surpassed the 1 million mark. In 1974, it was rumored to be planning a takeover of Speidel Newspapers. The Thomson Organization was reorganised into the International Thomson Organization in 1978 in order to move its operating base from Britain to Canada, so that it would not be subject to British monopolies legislation, foreign‐exchange controls and dividend limitation. The International Thomson Organization and Thomson Newspapers merged in 1989, creating the Thomson Corporation. Over the years, the company has withdrawn from its holdings in the oil and gas business, the travel industry and department stores.

When Kenneth Thomson took over from his father Roy in 1976, the company was worth about $500 million. At Kenneth&#x27;s death in June 2006, the company was valued at about $29.3 billion.

===Transition to business information===
In 1978, the acquisition of Wadsworth Publishing provided Thomson with its first entry into specialised information, college textbooks and professional books. (In 2007, Thomson Learning, including the Wadsworth imprint, was sold and renamed as Cengage Learning.)

Starting in the mid-1990s, Thomson invested further in specialised information services (but this time providing them in digital format) and began selling off its newspapers. That was about the time Richard J. Harrington, an accountant, became chief executive officer of the company. One of the first moves came when Thomson spent $3.4 billion to acquire the West Publishing Company, a legal information provider in Eagan, Minnesota.

In recent years, Thomson provided much of the specialised information content the world&#x27;s financial, legal, research and medical organizations rely on every day to make business-critical decisions and drive innovation. While it remained a publishing company, early and aggressive investment in electronic delivery had become a key company goal. &quot;Except for its educational division, which still publishes a substantial number of conventional textbooks, Thomson had the good fortune to move into these businesses as customers were demanding electronic delivery of their information&quot;, according to a 3 July 2006 article. &quot;In some markets, Thomson was able to move past other players who were more cautious about digital conversion.&quot;

In 2003, the Thomson Corporation bought the Chilton automotive assets. Also in 2003, Thomson acquired the software company Elite Information Group and medical education company Gardiner-Caldwell. Also in 2003, Thomson sold its medical magazine publishing units to Advanstar Communications. Thomson also acquired the publisher Techstreet.

In 2004, Thomson acquired Tradeweb. In late 2004, the company sold its Thomson Media group to Investcorp. The B2B publishing group, which features such titles as &quot;American Banker, National Mortgage News&quot;, and &quot;The Bond Buyer&quot;, was renamed SourceMedia.

In 2005, Thomson acquired medical education company Physicians World.

In October 2006, the company confirmed it would sell the Thomson Learning market group in three parts. The first part, corporate education and training (NETg), has agreed to be sold to Skillsoft for $285 million. Apax announced its acquisition of Thomson&#x27;s higher education business on 11 May 2007, for $7.5 billion in cash assets.

In 2007, Thomson sold Thomson Medical Education (including Physicians&#x27; World and Gardiner-Caldwell) to private equity firm ABRY Partners. The group was renamed KnowledgePoint360.

==Brands==
Some of Thomson&#x27;s brands are better known than the company name itself. Its brands include Thomson ONE, Westlaw, FindLaw, BARBRI, Pangea3, Physician&#x27;s Desk Reference (now published digitally as the &quot;Prescriber&#x27;s Digital Reference&quot;), RIA, Thomson Tax and Accounting (tax and accounting software and services for accountants), Creative Solutions, Quickfinder, DISEASEDEX (now merged with IBM Watson Health), DrugREAX, Medstat, Thomson First Call (now a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group, known as Refinitiv), Checkpoint, EndNote (now produced by Clarivate, an independent company), Derwent World Patents Index (now produced by Clarivate), SAEGIS (now produced by Clarivate), MicroPatent, Aureka (now owned by Clarivate), Faxpat, OptiPat, Just Files, Faxpat, OptiPat, Just Files, Corporate Intelligence, InfoTrac (now owned by Cengage), Delphion, Arco Test Prep (now owned by Cengage), Peterson&#x27;s Directories (now owned by Cengage), NewsEdge, TradeWeb, Web of Science (now produced by Clarivate) and the Arden Shakespeare (now published by Bloomsbury Publishing). Thomson formerly owned Jane&#x27;s Information Group, now owned by Montagu Private Equity. These information sources are produced by the many companies of Thomson, including West Publishing, Thomson Financial, ISI (now owned by Clarivate), Thomson Gale (now owned by Cengage), Dialog Corporation (now owned by Clarivate), Brookers, Carswell, CCBN, Course Technology (now owned by Cengage), Gardiner-Caldwell, IHI, Lawbook Co, Wadsworth (now owned by Cengage), Thomson CompuMark (now owned by Clarivate) and Sweet &amp; Maxwell.

Thomson Reuters New Zealand Limited has been publishing and updating information on New Zealand law since 1910, formerly as John Friend Ltd, to Brooker and Friend Ltd, to Brookers, to Thomson Brookers&#x27;.

Thomson had divested many of its traditional media assets – or combined them with digital products – and had moved toward a larger reliance on information technology services and products.

==Restatements==
On 1 January 2004, Thomson adopted a new accounting standard, which required restatement of all prior periods. The company restated its financial reports accordingly.

==Corporate governance==
Members of the last board of directors of Thomson were as follows: David K.R. Thomson (chairman of the board since 2002), W. Geoffrey Beattie, Richard Harrington, Ron D. Barbaro, Mary Cirillo, Robert Daleo, Steven Denning, Maureen Darkes, Roger Martin, Vance Opperman, John M. Thompson, Peter Thomson, Richard Thomson and John A. Tory.

The Thomson family owned 70% of the company.

When Kenneth Thomson died in June 2006, control of the family fortune passed on to David K.R. Thomson under a plan put together decades earlier by company founder Roy Thomson.

&quot;David, my grandson, will have to take his part in the running of the organisation and David&#x27;s son, too,&quot; Roy wrote in his 1975 autobiography. &quot;With the fortune that we will leave to them go also responsibilities. These Thomson boys that come after Ken are not going to be able, even if they want to, to shrug off these responsibilities.&quot;

The Thomson family controlled the Thomson Corporation through a family-owned entity, the Woodbridge Company, based in Toronto. (Along with 70% of Thomson Corporation, Woodbridge also owns a 40% stake in CTVglobemedia, which now owns the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; daily newspaper in Toronto and CTV, Canada&#x27;s largest commercial TV network.) David K.R. Thomson and his brother, Peter Thomson, became co-chairmen of Woodbridge after their father&#x27;s death.

<doc id="483186" wikidata="Q5273959" url="?curid=483186" title="Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons">
<text>The Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons (DANAS) is a multivolume work published by Naval Historical Center of the U.S. Department of the Navy&#x27;s Naval History &amp; Heritage Command. It covers naval aviation in much the same way as the &quot;Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships&quot; (&quot;DANFS&quot;) covers commissioned vessels.

Two volumes have been published to date: Volume 1, covering the history of attack and strike fighter squadrons, and Volume 2, covering the history of patrol squadrons. Additional volumes are forthcoming.

The squadron histories are quite detailed, typically including sections on lineage, insignia and nickname, chronology of significant events, home port assignments, commanding officers, aircraft assigned, major overseas deployments, airwing assignments, and unit awards received.

&quot;DANAS&quot; volumes are available online and as PDF files on CD-ROM.

==Publication data==
Volume 1 (1995) includes about 140 histories and other data covering every squadron in the attack (VA, VAH, VAK, VAL, and VAP) and strike fighter (VFA) communities from the time the first of these commands was established in 1934, through the publication of this volume in 1995. There are seven appendixes, including such things as technical information and drawings for aircraft assigned to the squadrons covered, carrier deployments by year, and lineage listings for the squadrons. A glossary, bibliography, and index are also included. The information was compiled by Roy A. Grossnick, the head of the Naval History and Heritage Command&#x27;s Naval Aviation History Office.

Volume 2 (2000) contains 154 histories covering every patrol squadron (VP, VPB, VP(H) and, VP(AM)) in existence between 1922 and 2000. Fourteen appendixes cover technical information on patrol aircraft, submarines sunk by patrol squadrons, air-to-air claims for Navy and Marine Corps patrol aircraft during World War II, a listing of patrol squadron shore bases, etc. A glossary, bibliography, and index are also included.

This book provides an opportunity to learn about the origins, achievements, and traditions of patrol aviation as it relates to the naval heritage of the United States. It was written by a professional historian and retired Navy Captain Michael D. Roberts.

Subsequent volumes in the series will cover other components of U.S. naval aviation. In 2000, the staff of the History &amp; Heritage Command&#x27;s Aviation History Branch was in the early stages of work on Volume 3, containing the histories and lineage of all U.S. Navy fighter squadrons.

==Reference use==
Because the &quot;DANAS&quot; is a work of the U.S. government, its content is in the public domain, and the text is often quoted verbatim in other works.

<text>In cryptography, a key distribution center (KDC) is part of a cryptosystem intended to reduce the risks inherent in exchanging keys. KDCs often operate in systems within which some users may have permission to use certain services at some times and not at others.

==Security overview==
For instance, an administrator may have established a policy that only certain users may back up to tape. Many operating systems can control access to the tape facility via a &quot;system service&quot;. If that system service further restricts the tape drive to operate only on behalf of users who can submit a service-granting ticket when they wish to use it, there remains only the task of distributing such tickets to the appropriately permitted users. If the ticket consists of (or includes) a key, one can then term the mechanism which distributes it a KDC. Usually, in such situations, the KDC itself also operates as a system service.

==Operation==
A typical operation with a KDC involves a request from a user to use some service. The KDC will use cryptographic techniques, mostly using symmetric encryption, to authenticate requesting users as themselves. It will also check whether an individual user has the right to access the service requested. If the authenticated user meets all prescribed conditions, the KDC can issue a ticket permitting access. 

In most (but not all) cases the KDC shares a key with each of all the other parties.
The KDC produces a ticket based on a server key.
The client receives the ticket and submits it to the appropriate server.
The server can verify the submitted ticket and grant access to user submitting it.

==Examples==
Security systems using KDCs include Kerberos. (Actually, Kerberos partitions KDC functionality between two different agents: the AS (Authentication Server) and the TGS (Ticket Granting Service).)

<doc id="483203" wikidata="Q2491168" url="?curid=483203" title="Lygodium">
<text>Lygodium (climbing fern) is a genus of about 40 species of ferns, native to tropical regions across the world, with a few temperate species in eastern Asia and eastern North America. It is the sole genus in the family Lygodiaceae in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Alternatively, the genus may be placed as the only genus in the subfamily Lygodioideae of a more broadly defined family Schizaeaceae, the family placement used in &quot;Plants of the World Online&quot; . Per recent molecular evidence, Lygodiaceae is thought to have diverged relatively early from the other members of the Schizaeales due to the relatively high level of synonymous sequence divergence between the families within the Schizaeales.

==Description==
&quot;Lygodium&quot; are unusual in that the rachis, or midrib, of the frond is thin, flexible, and long, the frond unrolling with indeterminate growth and the rachis twining around supports, so that each frond forms a distinct vine. The fronds may be from long, depending on the species. They are also easily identifiable by their possession of apical buds that lay dormant until damage to the rachis occurs, allowing them a high degree of endurance.

== Range ==
&quot;Lygodium&quot; is a wide ranging genus with native populations existing in Asia, Australasia, Africa, and North and South America. The genus is largely pan-tropical, with the center of diversity being Pacific islands, such as Borneo, the Philippine islands, and New Guinea. There do exist several species tolerant of temperate climates such as &quot;Lygodium palmatum&quot;, which is endemic to the Appalachian region of eastern North America, and &quot;Lygodium japonicum&quot;, which is native to Japan, but highly invasive in the Southeastern United States. For more on this, refer to the &quot;As invasive species&quot; section below. The lack of extant &quot;Lygodium&quot; species in Europe is commonly attributed to the Pleistocene glaciation wiping them out. Similar extirpations did not occur in other high middle and high latitude areas, such as the United States and Japan that do have &quot;Lygodium&quot; populations at present. This discrepancy is thought to be due to the East-West orientation of the European Alps preventing southward migration of &quot;Lygodium&quot; members, among other extirpated species, while the relatively North-South orientations of the Appalachian mountains and Japanese Alps allowed such southward migration.

==Uses==
&quot;Lygodium&quot; species, known as &quot;nito&quot;, are used as a source of fibers in the Philippines. The fibers are used as material for weaving, most notably of traditional salakot headgear.

==As invasive species==
Some &quot;Lygodium&quot; species are now considered very problematic invasive weeds in the southeastern United States. Populations of &quot;Lygodium&quot; have increased more than 12-fold over the past decade, as noted by Florida&#x27;s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences.

Japanese climbing fern (&quot;Lygodium japonicum&quot;) was added to the Florida Noxious Weed List in 1999. It is also a major problem in pine plantations, causing contamination and harvesting problems for the pine straw industry. Old World climbing fern (&quot;Lygodium microphyllum&quot;) infests cypress swamps and other hydric sites, forming a monoculture. This massive infestation displaces all native flora and fauna, completely changing the ecosystem of the area.

Plants in this genus have basal chromosome counts of &quot;n=28, 29, 30&quot;.

<doc id="483204" wikidata="Q353901" url="?curid=483204" title="Iwane Matsui">
<text>was a general in the Imperial Japanese Army and the commander of the expeditionary force sent to China in 1937. He was convicted of war crimes and executed by the Allies for his involvement in the Nanjing Massacre.

Born in Nagoya, Matsui chose a military career and served in combat during the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05). He volunteered for an overseas assignment there shortly after graduating from the Army War College in 1906. As Matsui rose through the ranks, he earned a reputation as the Japanese Army&#x27;s foremost expert on China, and he was an ardent advocate of pan-Asianism. He played a key role in founding the influential Greater Asia Association.

Matsui retired from active duty in 1935 but was called back into service in August 1937 at the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War to lead the Japanese forces engaged in the Battle of Shanghai. After winning the battle Matsui succeeded in convincing Japan&#x27;s high command to advance on the Chinese capital city of Nanjing. The troops under his command who captured Nanjing on December 13 were responsible for the notorious Nanjing Massacre.

Matsui finally retired from the army in 1938. Following Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II he was convicted of war crimes at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE) and executed by hanging. He and other convicted war criminals were enshrined at Yasukuni Shrine in 1978, an act that has stirred controversy.

==Early life and military career, 1878–1906==
Iwane Matsui was born in Nagoya on July 27, 1878. He was the sixth son of Takekuni Matsui, an impoverished samurai and former retainer to the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Owari during the Tokugawa shogunate. After completing elementary school, his parents insisted that he continue his education, but Matsui worried about his father&#x27;s debts and did not want to burden him financially. Though he was a short, thin, and sickly young man, Matsui opted for a career in the Army, because in Japan at that time military schools charged the lowest tuition fees.

Matsui enrolled in the Central Military Preparatory School in 1893 and in 1896 was accepted into the Imperial Japanese Army Academy. Matsui was an excellent student and graduated second in his class in November 1897. His classmates included the future generals Jinzaburō Masaki, Nobuyuki Abe, Shigeru Honjō, and Sadao Araki.

In 1901, Matsui was admitted into the Army War College, an elite institution which accepted only about ten percent of annual applicants. Matsui was still taking classes there in February 1904, when the College closed due to the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War. He was immediately sent overseas where he served in Manchuria as a company commander in a combat unit of the 6th Regiment. During the Battle of Shoushanpu, he was wounded in action and most in his company were killed. At war&#x27;s end, Matsui resumed his studies at the Army War College, and graduated at the top of his class in November 1906.

==The &quot;China expert&quot;, 1906–31==
Matsui had a lifelong interest in Chinese civilization. His father was a scholar of Chinese classics and Matsui studied the Chinese language during his military education. Matsui was a fervent admirer of the recently deceased Sei Arao (1858–1896), a &quot;continental adventurer&#x27; (&quot;tairiku rōnin&quot;) and pan-Asianist army officer from his hometown who had served in China. Arao believed that China and Japan, as the two strongest powers in Asia, had to forge a close trading and commercial partnership under Japanese hegemony to resist Western imperialism, an idea which Matsui incorporated into his own worldview. After graduating from the Army War College, Matsui immediately requested to be stationed in China. Only one other officer had made this request, since a posting in China was considered undesirable at the time. Matsui&#x27;s stated ambition was to become &quot;a second Sei Arao&quot;.

At first the Army General Staff gave Matsui an assignment in France, but in 1907 he got his wish to go to China, where he worked as an aide to the military attaché and did intelligence work. Matsui worked in China between 1907 and 1911, and then again as resident officer in Shanghai between 1915 and 1919. In 1921 Matsui was posted to Siberia as a staff officer, but returned in 1922 to China where he served until 1924 as an advisor to Zhang Zuolin in the Chinese city of Harbin and did intelligence work for Japan&#x27;s Kwantung Army.

Due to his extensive experience in China Matsui became recognized as one of the most important of the Japanese Army&#x27;s &quot;China experts&quot;, and he was well known in the Army for his love of things Chinese and his hobby of writing Chinese poetry. His work took him throughout China, and he came to know many prominent Chinese soldiers and politicians. Matsui formed an especially warm friendship with Sun Yat-sen, the first president of the Republic of China. In 1907 when a young Chiang Kai-shek (then a Chinese soldier) wanted to study abroad, Matsui helped him find a place to stay in Japan.

===Head of intelligence===
Matsui quickly rose through the ranks and in 1923 was promoted to the rank of major general. Between 1925 and 1928 he would serve in the influential post of Chief of the Intelligence Division of the Army General Staff. He was the first &quot;China expert&quot; to be appointed to that position and would have a major influence determining Japan&#x27;s foreign policies toward China.

As Chief of the Intelligence Division, Matsui was a strong supporter of Chiang Kai-shek, who was attempting to end the civil war in China and unify the country under his leadership. Matsui hoped that Chiang would succeed and form a strong partnership with Japan to resist both Western influence in Asia and communism. However, Matsui&#x27;s tenure in office was punctuated by a series of crises. Against Matsui&#x27;s advice the Japanese government sent troops to the Chinese city of Jinan in 1928 to protect Japanese property and civilians, but they ended up clashing with the Chinese Army. Matsui headed to Jinan to help settle the affair, but while he was still there Japanese army officers assassinated Zhang Zuolin, the warlord leader of Manchuria. Matsui, who had been a supporter of Zhang, immediately left for Manchuria to find out what had happened. He demanded that the officers responsible for the assassination be punished.

In December 1928 Matsui left his post as Chief of the Intelligence Division in order to make an official, year-long trip to Europe. Matsui was interested in France as well as China; he spoke fluent French and had already done work for the Japanese Army in both France and French Indochina.

==Matsui&#x27;s pan-Asian vision, 1931–37==
Sino-Japanese relations plummeted in September 1931 when the Kwantung Army invaded Manchuria. At the time Matsui was back in Japan commanding the 11th Division, but at the end of the year he was sent to Geneva, Switzerland, to attend the World Disarmament Conference as an army plenipotentiary.

At first Matsui condemned the invasion as the work of renegade army officers, but he was equally stung by what he believed were unfair denunciations of Japan itself by Chinese delegates to the League of Nations. Matsui suspected that the Western powers and the League of Nations were deliberately attempting to provoke conflict between Japan and China. Matsui believed that the 30 million Manchurians had been relieved by the Japanese invasion and conquest, which he called &#x27;the Empire&#x27;s sympathy and good faith&#x27; and that the solution to the larger regional problem was for the nations of Asia to create their own &quot;Asian League&quot;, which would &quot;extend to the 400 million people of China the same help and deep sympathy that we have given Manchuria&quot;.

After returning to Japan in late 1932, Matsui abruptly appeared at the office of the Pan-Asia Study Group, a Tokyo-based think tank, and presented its members with a bold plan to expand their small organization into an international mass movement. Matsui persuaded them to adopt his ideas, and in March 1933 the study group was rechristened the Greater Asia Association (大亜細亜協会 &quot;Dai-Ajia Kyōkai&quot;), described by the historian Torsten Weber as &quot;the single most influential organization to propagate pan-Asianism between 1933 and 1945.&quot; The goal of the Greater Asia Association was to promote &quot;the unification, liberation, and independence of the Asian peoples&quot;, and Matsui would use the organization as a powerful vehicle to promote his &quot;Asian League&quot; concept both in Japan and abroad. The writings he published with the Association were widely read by Japan&#x27;s political and military elites.

In August 1933 Matsui was dispatched to Taiwan to command the Taiwan Army, and then on October 20 was promoted to the rank of general, the highest rank in the Japanese Army. While in Taiwan, he took the opportunity to set up a branch of the Greater Asia Association, which declared Matsui its &quot;honorary advisor&quot;. He then returned to Japan in August 1934 to take a seat on Japan&#x27;s Supreme War Council.

Meanwhile, Sino-Japanese relations continued to deteriorate and Matsui too was gradually souring toward the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek, the same government he had strongly promoted back when serving as Chief of the Intelligence Division. In the first issue of the Greater Asia Association&#x27;s official bulletin, put out in 1933, Matsui denounced China&#x27;s leaders for having &quot;sold out their own country of China and betrayed Asia&quot; due to their allegedly pro-Western attitudes. Over time he gravitated toward a group within the Army General Staff led by General Tetsuzan Nagata, which was advocating that Japan use military force to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek.

Matsui&#x27;s career came to an abrupt end in August 1935 when Nagata, a member of the so-called &quot;Control Faction&quot;, was assassinated by a member of the rival Imperial Way Faction. By this point Matsui was fed up with the ruthless factional infighting that had divided the Japanese Army, and so he decided that he would take responsibility for the scandal and resign from active duty in the Army.

===A general in the reserves===
Now that he was a reservist, Matsui had more time to pursue his pan-Asian project. Between October and December 1935 he toured the major cities of China and Manchukuo speaking to Chinese politicians and businessmen about pan-Asianism and setting up a new branch of the Greater Asia Association in Tianjin. Upon his return to Japan in December 1935 he became President of the Greater Asia Association. In February and March 1936, amid ongoing tension with China, Matsui made a second trip to China, this time on a government-sponsored goodwill tour. Matsui met personally with Chiang, and though he found little common ground with him, they at least were united in their anti-communism. Matsui came out of the meeting believing that joint anti-communism could be the basis for Sino-Japanese cooperation in the future. Then in December 1936, following the Xi&#x27;an Incident, Chiang agreed to join with the Chinese Communist Party to resist Japan, a move that Matsui viewed as a personal betrayal.

==At war in China, 1937–38==
In July 1937, following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, full-scale war broke out between Japan and China. Initially limited to northern China, the fighting spread in August to Shanghai. The Japanese government decided to send two divisions of reinforcements to drive the Chinese Army from Shanghai, which would be organized as the Shanghai Expeditionary Army (SEA). Due to a shortage of active duty generals, the Army General Staff opted to pull someone from the reserves to lead the new army and on August 15 Matsui was officially appointed commander of the SEA. The reason why Matsui was selected is not entirely clear, but his reputation as a &quot;China expert&quot; was likely a major factor. The historian Ikuhiko Hata argues that at the time the Army General Staff was hoping to seek a settlement with China once Shanghai had been secured for Japan, and Matsui, because of his close friendships with China&#x27;s leaders, was seen as an ideal candidate to conduct the negotiations. Matsui declared that his mission would be &quot;to make the Chinese people recognize that Japanese troops are the real friends of China&quot;, and likewise stated that &quot;I am going to the front not to fight an enemy but in the state of mind of one who sets out to pacify his brother.&quot; However, one of his old acquaintances in the Chinese Army remarked in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;There can be no friendship between us while there is war between China and Japan.&quot;

While sailing to Shanghai Matsui adopted a plan drawn by the Japanese Navy to divide the SEA between two landing sites north of Shanghai, Wusong and Chuanshakou, and then use the former force to attack Shanghai directly and the latter force to encircle the Chinese Army. On August 23 Matsui oversaw the landing operation from aboard his flagship the &quot;Yura&quot;. The initial landings went well, but increasingly intense fighting ensued on land and casualties mounted. Matsui had never believed that he had been given enough soldiers to handle the job and was continuously pressing the high command for more reinforcements. He himself was not able to go ashore in Shanghai until September 10, but that was the same day on which the Army General Staff informed him that three additional divisions would be deployed under his command. Still, even this infusion of new troops proved insufficient to dislodge the Chinese. He had mistakenly judged at the beginning of October that the Chinese Army was about to withdraw from Shanghai and had ordered concentrated infantry charges on the Chinese positions in the expectation that the campaign would be wrapped up before November. In fact the SEA was still battering Chinese defensive lines at Nanxiang and Suzhou Creek at that point. The turning point of the campaign did not come until November 5 when an entirely new army, the 10th Army led by Heisuke Yanagawa, landed south of Shanghai and forced the Chinese Army to make a hasty retreat. Shanghai had finally fallen by November 26.

The fighting also took a toll on Chinese civilians, and even at the height of the battle Matsui took a special interest in the plight of Chinese refugees. In October he ordered that improvements be made to living conditions in Chinese refugee camps and later he made a large personal donation of $10,000 to the French humanitarian Father Jacquinot to help him in establishing a &quot;safety zone&quot; for Chinese civilians in Shanghai.

===Road to Nanjing===
On November 7 Matsui was appointed commander of the Central China Area Army (CCAA), a new position created to provide unified leadership to the SEA and the 10th Army. Matsui continued to command the SEA as well until Prince Asaka was appointed to take over from him on December 2. Nonetheless, the Army General Staff was keen on keeping the war as contained as possible and so at the same time that it created the CCAA it also laid down an &quot;operation restriction line&quot; forbidding the CCAA from leaving the vicinity of Shanghai.

However, Matsui had made it clear to his superiors even before he had left Japan in August that he was determined to capture the capital city of China, Nanjing, which lay 300 kilometers west of Shanghai. Matsui forcefully asserted that the war with China would not end until Nanjing was in their control, and he envisaged that the fall of Nanjing would result in the total collapse of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s government. After Chiang&#x27;s fall Matsui hoped to play a role in forming a new government in China which, according to his own conception, would be a democracy that would better serve the interests of both Japan and the people of China. However, the historian Tokushi Kasahara also sees personal motives behind Matsui&#x27;s insistence on capturing Nanjing. Kasahara suspects that Matsui, as an aging general with a relatively undistinguished military record, desperately wanted to crown his career with one last battlefield victory like the capture of the Chinese capital.

Ultimately it was Heisuke Yanagawa&#x27;s 10th Army which, on November 19, abruptly crossed the operation restriction line and began advancing on Nanjing. In response to this flagrant act of insubordination, Matsui, it is claimed, made some effort to restrain Yanagawa, but he also insisted to the high command that marching on Nanjing was the right course of action. On December 1 the Army General Staff finally came around and approved an operation against Nanjing, though by then many of Japan&#x27;s units in the field were already well on their way.

Matsui had gotten his way, but he still understood that his troops were tired from the fighting in Shanghai. He therefore decided to advance slowly with the aim of securing the city within two months. Nevertheless, his subordinates refused to play along and instead raced with one another to be the first to Nanjing. Matsui revised his plans only upon discovering that his own armies were well ahead of their scheduled operational targets. It is again argued that Matsui was unable to restrain the men under his command, and that, since Matsui was an elderly general pulled from retirement, most of his younger and brasher subordinates had little respect for his orders and assumed that he would be back in the reserves and shortly out of their way. Matsui&#x27;s command problems were made further complicated by the fact that, between December 5 and 15, he was frequently bedridden due to bouts of tuberculosis, which he had first shown symptoms of on November 4. Though ill, he forced himself to press on with his duties, issuing orders from his sickbed. On December 7 he moved his command post from Shanghai to Suzhou to be closer to the frontlines, and on December 9 he ordered that a &quot;summons to surrender&quot; be dropped by airplane over Nanjing. Because the Chinese Army defending Nanjing did not respond, the next day Matsui approved an all-out attack on the city. The CCAA suffered significant casualties fighting along the mountainous terrain just north of the city because Matsui had forbidden his men from using artillery there to prevent any damage from coming to its two famous historical sites, Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum. Although the Chinese garrison defending Nanjing collapsed under pressure of the Japanese attack within a few days, instead of formally surrendering the Chinese soldiers simply threw away their uniforms and weapons and then merged with the city&#x27;s civilian population. The Japanese occupied Nanjing on the night of December 12/13. Japanese soldiers in the city then massacred prisoners of war and engaged in random acts of murder, looting, torture, and rape which are collectively known as the Nanjing Massacre.

===The Nanjing Massacre===
Matsui and his staff officers in the CCAA had been especially intent on ensuring that the property and citizens of third party nations were not harmed in order to avoid causing an international incident; they had foreseen the possibility that their troops might disobey orders upon entering Nanjing, as many of them were poorly disciplined reservists. To forestall this possibility, Matsui tacked a lengthy addendum entitled &quot;Essentials for Assaulting Nanjing&quot; onto the comprehensive operational orders that he passed down to all units on December 7. In &quot;Essentials&quot; Matsui instructed each of his divisions to only allow one of their regiments into the city itself in order to reduce the Japanese Army&#x27;s contact with Chinese civilians, and he reminded all his subordinates that criminal acts such as looting or arson would be severely punished, though in the court martial ledger for December 20, Matsui, taking note of raping and looting incidents, wrote that &#x27;the truth is that some such acts are unavoidable&#x27;. Ultimately, Matsui&#x27;s orders were again disobeyed. Most of the buildings and civilian homes outside Nanjing had been burned down by the Chinese Army to deprive the Japanese of shelter, so Matsui&#x27;s subordinate commanders decided on their own that they had no choice but to station all their men within the city itself.

Nevertheless, Matsui&#x27;s instructions said nothing about treatment of Chinese POWs. Matsui inadvertently contributed to the atrocity in a major way when he demanded on December 14 that his triumphal entrance into Nanjing be scheduled for the early date of December 17. At the time his subordinates in Nanjing objected because they were still in the process of scrambling to apprehend all the former Chinese soldiers hiding in the city and had no facilities in which to hold them. Regardless, Matsui held firm, and in many cases his men responded to the conundrum by ordering that all their prisoners be executed immediately after capture. Most of the large-scale massacres that took place within Nanjing occurred in the days immediately prior to Matsui&#x27;s entrance into the city.

On December 16 Matsui spent the day recovering from his malaria at the Tangshuizhen hot springs east of Nanjing, and then the next day he rode into Nanjing itself at the head of a large victory parade. It is not clear to what extent Matsui was aware of the atrocities perpetrated in Nanjing. His former Chief of Staff in the SEA later testified that Matsui had been informed of &quot;a few cases of plunder and outrage&quot; shortly after entering the city, and Matsui&#x27;s own field diary also mentions being told that Japanese troops had committed acts of rape and looting. Matsui commented in his field diary, &quot;The truth is that some such acts are unavoidable.&quot; When a representative from the Japanese Foreign Ministry came to investigate the matter, Matsui admitted that some crimes had occurred and he blamed his subordinate commanders for allowing too many soldiers into the city in violation of his orders. After the war, Matsui&#x27;s aide-de-camp Yoshiharu Sumi claimed that not long after the capture of Nanjing Matsui caught wind of a plan by some of his subordinates to massacre Chinese POWs and upon hearing of this he immediately put a stop to it. However researchers have since discovered that Sumi&#x27;s testimony contained a large number of inaccuracies.

Matsui left Nanjing on December 22 and returned to Shanghai, though reports of scandalous incidents perpetrated by Japanese soldiers in Nanjing continued to filter in to his headquarters over the following month. When Matsui returned to Nanjing on February 7, 1938, for a two-day tour he assembled his subordinates, including Prince Asaka and Heisuke Yanagawa, and harangued them for failing to prevent &quot;a number of abominable incidents within the past 50 days&quot;.

===Final days in China===
The capture of Nanjing had not led to the surrender of the Nationalist Government as Matsui had predicted and the war with China continued. Undeterred, Matsui began planning out new military operations in places such as Xuzhou and Zhejiang province soon after he had returned to Shanghai. The other big task occupying his time in January and February 1938 was his plan to establish a new Chinese government in Central China. Matsui was bound and determined to press forward with his ambition to found a new regime to rival Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Nationalist Government, and though he did not finish the job before leaving office, the Reformed Government of the Republic of China would eventually come into being in March 1938. However, the leaders of Japan&#x27;s Army General Staff showed scant interest in his plan to create a new government in China and they also repeatedly refused to approve any new military campaigns under his command. By the beginning of February Matsui was contemplating suicide to protest their lack of enthusiasm.

By then, there was already a movement within the Army General Staff to have Matsui removed from his post. Reports of the atrocities in Nanjing had reached the Japanese government and some within the Army General Staff blamed Matsui for mishandling the crisis and causing Japan international embarrassment. Some even wanted him court-martialed for negligence. Even so, the Japanese government was not planning on dismissing Matsui solely because of the Nanjing Massacre. The Foreign Ministry was displeased by anti-Western statements Matsui had made after becoming CCAA commander, including his comment that he did not recognize the neutrality of foreign concessions in Shanghai, and the Army General Staff was concerned about Matsui&#x27;s severe personality conflicts with his subordinate commanders, which were interfering with the chain of command. The Army Minister Hajime Sugiyama told General Shunroku Hata that the inability of Matsui and his subordinates to coordinate and cooperate with one another was the reason he was being removed.

On February 10 Matsui received a messenger from the Army General Staff who informed him, much to Matsui&#x27;s chagrin and disappointment, that he would soon be relieved of command and replaced with Shunroku Hata. Ultimately, the Army General Staff did not punish Matsui but they did shake up the whole field command in China and Matsui was just one of eighty senior officers, including Asaka and Yanagawa, who were all recalled at the same time.

==Life in retirement, 1938–46==

Matsui sailed out of Shanghai on February 21, 1938, and landed back in Japan on February 23. Though the time and place of his return to Japan had been kept secret by the military, reporters quickly caught wind of his return and soon Matsui was being greeted everywhere he went by cheering crowds. Later that year Matsui bought a new home in Atami in Shizuoka Prefecture and from then until 1946 he spent his winters living in Atami and his summers living at his old house on Lake Yamanaka.

In spite of retiring from the military, Matsui hoped to get another job in China working with the Japanese-sponsored government there. Ultimately, he instead accepted the position of Cabinet Councillor, an advisory post, in June 1938. He continued to serve in this capacity until January 1940 when he resigned to protest Prime Minister Mitsumasa Yonai&#x27;s opposition to an alliance with Nazi Germany.

It was also in 1940 that Matsui commissioned the construction of a statue of Kannon, the bodhisattva of mercy, and then had a special temple built in Atami to enshrine it. He named it the Koa Kannon, which means the &quot;Pan-Asian Kannon&quot;, and he consecrated it in honor of all the Japanese and Chinese soldiers who perished during the Second Sino-Japanese War. At the time &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Matsui&#x27;s act, noting that &quot;few Western generals have ever devoted their declining years to the memory of the men who died in their battles&quot;. Henceforth, on every single day that Matsui spent in Atami for the rest of his life he prayed in front of the Koa Kannon once early in the morning and once in the evening.

Throughout this time Matsui remained active in the pan-Asian movement. Although the Greater Asia Association was reorganized several times between 1942 and 1945, at no point did Matsui ever cease to serve as either the President or Vice President of the organization. Following Japan&#x27;s entrance into World War II in December 1941, Matsui strongly advocated that Japan grant independence to the new territories it had occupied during the war and then form an alliance of Asian states to combat the Allied Powers. Between June and August 1943 Matsui undertook a tour of Asia, including China, Indochina, Singapore, Thailand, Burma, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines in order to promote his ideas. Matsui met with Wang Jingwei in China and with Subhas Chandra Bose, the head of the Indian National Army, in Singapore. He also caused a diplomatic incident in Indochina, which was still nominally under French colonial rule, when he delivered a speech demanding that it be granted full independence. Matsui&#x27;s efforts played a key role in the creation and consolidation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which was the culmination of Matsui&#x27;s lifelong vision of an &quot;Asian League&quot; united against the West.

In addition to the Greater Asia Association, Matsui also served throughout the war as President of the Association for the National Defense Concept, a virulently anti-Western and anti-Semitic organization founded in February 1942 to support the Japanese war effort. In 1945 as the Allies bore down on the Philippines Matsui declared over the radio that Japan would never withdraw from the Philippines &quot;even though Tokyo should be reduced to ashes.&quot; Soon after he also stated his plans to speak at a lecture meeting on August 20 opposing any surrender. Nevertheless, on August 15, 1945, at his home in Atami Matsui heard Emperor Hirohito announce that Japan had surrendered unconditionally to the Allies.

The Allied occupation of Japan began soon after. On November 19 the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers issued an arrest warrant for Matsui on suspicion of war crimes. Matsui was ill with pneumonia at the time and so was given until March to recover. One of Matsui&#x27;s final acts before going to prison was to ask his wife to adopt their longtime maid Hisae as their daughter. He also converted from Shintoism to Buddhism and asked that his wife do the same. On March 6, 1946, he surrendered himself in to Sugamo Prison.

==On trial in Tokyo, 1946–48==
On April 29, 1946, Iwane Matsui became one of twenty-eight individuals formally indicted before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE), a tribunal established by the Allies of World War II to try Japanese war criminals. The prosecution charged Matsui with Class A war crimes or &quot;crimes against peace&quot;, alleging that he had participated in a conspiracy to wage aggressive war against other countries, and also with Class B/C war crimes or &quot;conventional war crimes&quot;, alleging that he was responsible for the Nanjing Massacre of 1937 to 1938.

Matsui had told friends before going to Sugamo Prison that at the IMTFE he planned to defend not only himself but also Japan&#x27;s wartime conduct as a whole. Matsui insisted that Japan had acted defensively against aggression by foreign powers and that Japan&#x27;s war aims were to liberate Asia from Western imperialism. Concerning the origins of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Matsui called it &quot;a fight between brothers within the &#x27;Asian family and stated that the war was fought against the Chinese, not &quot;because we hate them, but on the contrary because we love them too much. It is just the same in a family when an elder brother has taken all that he can stand from his ill-behaved younger brother and has to chastise him in order to make him behave properly.&quot;

On the matter of the Nanjing Massacre, Matsui admitted that he was aware of a few isolated crimes committed by individual soldiers, including acts of rape, looting, and murder, but he adamantly denied that any large-scale massacres had occurred in the city. Still, Matsui admitted to the IMTFE that he bore &quot;moral responsibility&quot; for the wrongdoing of his men. He denied that he bore &quot;legal responsibility&quot; because, he claimed, it was the military police of each division who were in charge of prosecuting individual criminal acts, not the army commander. However, Matsui also testified that he had urged that any offenders be sternly punished, a statement which, the prosecution quickly noted, implied that he did have some level of legal responsibility.

Ultimately the IMTFE dismissed most of the accusations laid against Matsui. Of the thirty-eight counts he was charged with, Matsui was found not guilty of thirty-seven, including all charges relating to Class A war crimes. The judges rejected Matsui&#x27;s membership in the Greater Asia Association as being evidence that he was involved in the &quot;conspiracy&quot; to wage wars of aggression.

Nonetheless, for his role in the Nanjing Massacre, he was convicted and sentenced to death under Count 55, charging defendants with having &quot;deliberately and recklessly disregarded their legal duty to take adequate steps to secure the observance and prevent breaches&quot; of the laws of war. The IMTFE delivered the following verdict on November 12, 1948.The Tribunal is satisfied that Matsui knew what was happening. He did nothing, or nothing effective to abate these horrors. He did issue orders before the capture of the city enjoining propriety of conduct upon his troops and later he issued further orders to the same purport. These orders were of no effect as is now known, and as he must have known... He was in command of the Army responsible for these happenings. He knew of them. He had the power, as he had the duty, to control his troops and to protect the unfortunate citizens of Nanking. He must be held criminally responsible for his failure to discharge this duty.Historian Yuma Totani notes that this verdict represents &quot;one of the earliest precedents for command responsibility in the history of international law.&quot;

Shortly after hearing the verdict Matsui confided to his prison chaplain, Shinsho Hanayama, his feelings about the atrocities in Nanjing and the rebuke he delivered to his subordinates on February 7, 1938. He blamed the atrocities on the alleged moral decline of the Japanese Army since the Russo-Japanese War, and said,The Nanjing Incident was a terrible disgrace ... Immediately after the memorial services, I assembled the higher officers and wept tears of anger before them, as Commander-in-Chief ... I told them that after all our efforts to enhance the Imperial prestige, everything had been lost in one moment through the brutalities of the soldiers. And can you imagine it, even after that, these officers laughed at me ... I am really, therefore, quite happy that I, at least, should have ended this way, in the sense that it may serve to urge self-reflection on many more members of the military of that time.On the night of December 22, 1948, Matsui met fellow condemned inmates Hideki Tojo, Akira Mutō, and Kenji Doihara at the prison chapel. As the oldest member of the group, Matsui was asked to lead them in shouting three cheers of banzai to the Emperor. Then he led the group up to the gallows where they were all hanged simultaneously shortly after midnight on the morning of December 23, 1948.

Soon after Matsui was executed, he was cremated and the US Army took away his ashes to prevent a memorial from being created. However, unbeknownst to them, some of the ashes had been hidden by the owner of the crematorium. He later brought these ashes to the shrine Matsui had founded, the Koa Kannon, and they remain there to this day. In 1978, all seven war criminals executed by the IMTFE, including Iwane Matsui, were officially enshrined in Yasukuni Shrine in a secret ceremony conducted by head priest Nagayoshi Matsudaira. This event did not become publicly known until the following year.

==Assessments and perception==
In Japan the majority of the historical literature on Iwane Matsui&#x27;s life focuses on his role in the Nanjing Massacre. He has both sympathizers, who depict him as &quot;the tragic general&quot; who was unjustly executed, and detractors, who assert that he had the blood of a massacre on his hands. Among his detractors is the historian Yutaka Yoshida, who believes that Matsui made six serious mistakes which contributed to the massacre. Firstly, he insisted on advancing on Nanjing without ensuring proper logistical support which forced his men to rely on plunder. Secondly, he established no policies to protect the safety of Chinese POWs. Thirdly, he permitted an excessively large number of soldiers to enter the city of Nanjing. Fourthly, he did not cooperate sufficiently with the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone. Fifthly, he insisted that his triumphal entrance into Nanjing be held at an early date, a demand which his subordinate commanders responded to by increasing the speed and severity of their operations. Finally, he spent too much time on political maneuvering and neglected his duties as commander. The historian Keiichi Eguchi and the researcher Toshio Tanabe likewise find that Matsui bears responsibility for urging the government to march on Nanjing, which led directly to the massacre. Tanabe concurs with Yoshida that Matsui should have put in place policies to protect Chinese POWs and should not have ordered a premature triumphal entrance into the city of Nanjing.

Nevertheless, other historians like Masahiro Yamamoto have argued that the death sentence was too severe a penalty for Matsui&#x27;s crime of mere negligence in failing to stop the massacre. The journalist Richard Minear also points out that Matsui&#x27;s penalty was disproportionately severe compared to the other convicted defendants. Kuniaki Koiso was found guilty on four counts and Mamoru Shigemitsu was found guilty on five counts, in both cases including one count of negligence, and both were given prison sentences. Matsui, by contrast, was found guilty of only one count of negligence but was sentenced to death. The historian Tokushi Kasahara argues that the prosecution at the IMTFE did not attempt seriously to investigate all those who were involved in the Nanjing Massacre, and instead just decided to make Matsui the sole scapegoat for the whole atrocity.

Matsui has a somewhat infamous reputation in China today. The popular nonfiction author Takashi Hayasaka asserts that he often heard Matsui referred to as &quot;the Hitler of Japan&quot; by Chinese citizens during his travels in the city of Nanjing because of Matsui&#x27;s connection to the Nanjing Massacre. However, Matsui&#x27;s name was not always notorious in China for this reason. In 1945 the Chinese Communist Party denounced Matsui as a war criminal because of his propaganda work for an ultranationalist group, rather than for the Nanjing Massacre. Historian Masataka Matsuura notes that the focus within current scholarship on Matsui&#x27;s role in the Nanjing Massacre has distracted from the fact that his pan-Asianism was the defining characteristic of his life.

<text>.name is a generic top-level domain (gTLD) in the Domain Name System of the Internet. It is intended for use by individuals for representation of their personal name, nicknames, screen names, pseudonyms, or other types of identification labels.

==History==
The top-level domain was founded by Hakon Haugnes and Geir Rasmussen and initially delegated to Global Name Registry in 2001, and become fully operational in January 2002. Verisign was the outsourced operator for .name since the .name launch in 2002 and acquired Global Name Registry in 2008.

In late September 2007, security researchers accused Global Name Registry of harboring hackers by charging fees per WHOIS lookup. The policy of selling detailed registration info about domains in &quot;name&quot; for US$2 each was criticized as hindering community efforts to locate and clean up malware-spreading hosts, zombies, and botnet control servers located in &quot;name&quot;. The registry offers unlimited lookups to approved users who sign a 10-page legal agreement.

In November 2009, internationalized domain names (IDNs) became available for second- and third-level domain names. IDNs are domain names that are represented by user applications in the native character set of a language.

==Structure==
When the TLD &quot;name&quot; was first launched, only third-level registrations and forwarded e-mail addresses were available. Second-level registrations became available in January 2004. The original intended structure of domain names was &quot;first.last.name&quot;, so that individuals could get a domain corresponding to their name.

The purpose of this sharing of second-level names was to ensure that the highest number of people possible could get an email address that included their last name. This sharing did not impact any other people with the same last name, and research by Global Name Registry showed that a majority of the world&#x27;s population does not have an overlapping firstname–lastname combination.

==Usage==
Subdomains of &quot;name&quot; may be registered at the second-level (&quot;john&quot;.name) and the third-level (&quot;john&quot;.doe.name). It is also possible to register an e-mail address of the form &quot;john@doe.name&quot;. Email forwarding will be operated by Verisign. The target address can be specified by an additional EPP mapping. The second-level domain of third-level subdomains is shared, and may not be registered by individuals.

The WHOIS service for &quot;name&quot; is available at whois.nic.name. Domain name registrations are available from accredited ICANN registrars.

<text>Sugamo Prison (&quot;Sugamo Kōchi-sho&quot;, Kyūjitai: , Shinjitai: ) was a prison in Tokyo, Japan. It was located in the district of Ikebukuro, which is now part of the Toshima ward of Tokyo, Japan.

==History==

Sugamo Prison was originally built in 1895, using the prisons of Europe as a model. By the 1930s it became known for housing political prisoners, including many communists and other dissenters who fell foul of the Peace Preservation Laws in the 1930s and 1940s. Allied spies were also incarcerated there, including Richard Sorge who was hanged in the prison on November 7, 1944. The prison also was used to hold captured Allied officers during World War II as well as airmen.

The prison was not damaged during the bombing of Tokyo in World War II, and was taken over by the Allied occupation forces during the occupation of Japan to house suspected war criminals as they awaited trial before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. After the conclusion of the trials, Sugamo Prison was used to incarcerate some of the convicted and was the site of the execution of seven inmates sentenced to death by hanging on December 23, 1948. The prison was also the execution site for 51 Japanese war criminals who were condemned in the Yokohama War Crimes Trials. The last 7 executions were carried out on April 7, 1950.

The original compound was only in size. The construction of exterior fencing expanded the facility to double the original size. After being captured and re-purposed by Allied forces, the facility was operated by the United States’ Eighth Army. Under the U.S. occupation, Sugamo Prison was administered by 400–500 soldiers. There were approximately 2500 military personnel assigned to duty at the prison, but no more than 500 at any given time. The prison was operated by occupation authorities from December 1945 through May 1952. The structure housed some 2000 Japanese war criminals during its operation.

The prisoners ate Japanese food prepared by Japanese personnel and served by the prisoners themselves. There were occasions when former Prime Minister Hideki Tojo served food to all the other class &quot;A&quot; prisoners. Some of the vegetables used in these meals were grown within the compound. On May 31, 1958, the last 18 Japanese war criminals still serving time in Sugamo Prison were paroled.

After the end of the occupation of Japan, Sugamo Prison passed to Japanese civilian government control. Most of the remaining war criminals were pardoned or paroled by the government. In 1962 its function as a prison ended. In 1971 the prison buildings were dismantled.

In 1978, the Sunshine 60 Building, at its completion the tallest skyscraper in Japan, was built on the former site of Sugamo Prison. All that is left to commemorate the prison is a stone on which is engraved, in Japanese, &quot;Pray for Eternal Peace.&quot; A water drainage outlet from the prison has been preserved in the park in front of the Tokyo International University Ikebukuro Campus, which stands on part of the former prison grounds.

<text>Westlaw is an online legal research service and proprietary database for lawyers and legal professionals available in over 60 countries. Information resources on Westlaw include more than 40,000 databases of case law, state and federal statutes, administrative codes, newspaper and magazine articles, public records, law journals, law reviews, treatises, legal forms and other information resources.

Most legal documents on Westlaw are indexed to the West Key Number System, which is West&#x27;s master classification system of U.S. law. Westlaw supports natural language and Boolean searches. Other significant Westlaw features include KeyCite, a citation checking service, which customers use to determine whether cases or statutes are still good law, and a customizable tabbed interface that lets customers bring their most-used resources to the top. Other tabs organize Westlaw content around the specific work needs of litigators, in-house corporate practitioners, and lawyers who specialize in any of over 150 legal topics. Most customers are attorneys or law students, but other individuals can also obtain accounts.

==History==
Westlaw was created in 1975 by West Publishing, a company whose headquarters have been in Eagan, Minnesota, since 1992; West was acquired by the Thomson Corporation in 1996. Several of Thomson&#x27;s law-related businesses outside the United States have their own Westlaw sites, and Westlaw&#x27;s foreign content is available online. For instance, Westlaw Canada from Carswell includes the Canadian Abridgment and KeyCite Canada, and Westlaw UK provides information from Sweet &amp; Maxwell and independent law reports, case analysis and case status icons. More recently, Westlaw China was introduced, with laws and regulations, cases, digests, and status icons (similar to KeyCite flags), for the law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Westlaw Ireland (IE) was established in 2002, covering information found in Round Hall publications as well as legislation, books, cases, current awareness and full-text articles from many of the country&#x27;s notable legal journals. Westlaw is used in over 68 countries.

Westlaw is descended from QUIC/LAW, a Canadian computer-assisted legal research project operated by Queen&#x27;s University from 1968 to 1973. The original name stood for &quot;Queen&#x27;s University Investigation of Computers and Law.&quot; It was directed by Hugh Lawford and Richard von Briesen, and the original code was based on an internal IBM text search project called INFORM/360. The IBM code turned out to be incomplete and required substantial modifications. In 1973, the project was commercialized in the form of a new company called QL Systems and a new product name, QL/SEARCH. In 1976, QL Systems licensed the QL/SEARCH software to West Publishing as the original foundation for what would become Westlaw.

West&#x27;s chief competitor in the legal information retrieval market is LexisNexis. (Ironically, Lawford and von Briesen sold what by then was called QuickLaw to LexisNexis in 2002.) Both Westlaw and LexisNexis started in the 1970s as dial-up services with dedicated terminals. The earliest versions used acoustic couplers or key phones; then smaller terminals with internal modems. Westlaw&#x27;s terminal was known as WALT, for West Automatic Law Terminal.

Around 1989, both started offering programs for personal computers that emulated the terminals, and when Internet access became available, an Internet address (such as westlaw.com) became an alternative that could be selected within the &quot;Communications Setup&quot; option in the client program, instead of a dial-up number. West&#x27;s program was known as Westmate. It was based on Borland C++ around 1997, and then changed to a program compiled on a Microsoft platform that incorporated portions of Internet Explorer. This was the first program to incorporate HTML; prior to that, Westmate had &quot;jumps&quot; indicated by triangles instead of &quot;links.&quot; Shortly after that, both publishers started developing web browser interfaces, with Westlaw&#x27;s being notable for the use of &quot;web dialogs&quot;, emulating the piling of open books on a table. Westmate was discontinued on June 30, 2007.

West introduced WestlawNext on February 8, 2010. The main advances are that a user can start a search without first selecting a database, which is helpful because WestLaw has over 40,000 databases, and the search screen allows one to click checkboxes to select the jurisdiction and nature of material wanted. A new search algorithm, referred to as WestSearch, executes a federated search across multiple content types. Users can either enter descriptive terms or Boolean connectors and select a jurisdiction. Documents are ranked by relevance. WestlawNext also supports retrieving documents by citation, party name or KeyCite reference. An overview page enables users to see the top results per content type, or to view all results for a particular content type. Filters can also be applied to refine the result list even further. On the results page, users can also see links to related secondary sources relevant to their research. WestlawNext also provides folders for storing portions of the research selected by the user.

The classic Westlaw.com platform was retired in August 2015. WestlawNext was renamed &quot;Thomson Reuters Westlaw&quot;, effective in February 2016.

==Features==

===KeyCite===
KeyCite is a case citator used in United States legal research that provides a list of all the authorities citing a particular case, statute, or other legal authority.

Verification of citations is necessary, because lawyers must determine whether a case has been reversed, overruled, or modified by a subsequent case before citing it in court. Further, when interpreting a statute it is necessary to examine previous judicial interpretations. The United States judiciary operates under the principle of &quot;stare decisis&quot; – a system of legal precedents – to ensure the courts deliver consistent rulings on similar legal issues, regardless of the political or social status of the parties involved. As such, legal professionals must be certain that the legal citations they use to reinforce their arguments are accurate and still &quot;good law.&quot;

KeyCite leverages Westlaw technologies, West&#x27;s attorney-authored case law headnotes and the West Key Number System to determine and immediately alert legal professionals that case law they are reviewing has been either overturned, or may have history that deems the precedential value of the opinion invalid.

KeyCite was introduced to Westlaw in 1997 and was the first citator to seriously challenge Shepard&#x27;s Citations, on which American legal professionals had relied for generations. Shepard&#x27;s had become such a necessary part of American legal research that the process of citation checking is still informally referred to as &quot;Shepardizing.&quot;

In 2004, KeyCite was the most-used citation checking service in an annual survey of law firm technology use conducted by the American Bar Association.

===Associated software and websites===
WestCheck is software that extracts citations from a word processing document and submits them to KeyCite or to Westlaw for retrieval of full text documents. The software consists of a standalone program and word processor add-in, either of which may be used, and a web site with the same functionality.

West also provides BriefTools, which replaces West CiteLink, and provides citation checking and file retrieval services within a word processing document. Another version only inserts Westlaw links into documents.

West CiteAdvisor formats citations and creates a table of authorities. Like WestCheck, it is available online at citeadvisor.westlaw.com, or as software for a word processor.

Westlaw CourtExpress allows searching of court docket information.

Westlaw Watch allows users to manage periodic monitoring of news and other databases for topics of interest.

Westlaw WebPlus provides a web search engine with a focus on legal information sites.

The Westlaw Litigator website provides access to legal calendaring and other litigation related applications.

Westlaw Today curates legal news and email alerts written by attorneys and Reuters reporters.

===Key Number System===
The West Key Number System is a master classification system of U.S. law, and is claimed to be &quot;the only recognized legal taxonomy.&quot; The West Key Number System was created by West Publishing Company and can be described as a highly detailed index of over 110,000 legal topics and sub-topics. The index serves as the backbone for legal information published by West, which appears in the company&#x27;s print publications, and now on Westlaw.

===The West Education Network (TWEN)===

TWEN is Westlaw&#x27;s online courseware that is specifically tailored for law schools. It is used as an online extension of the classroom. Teachers use it to post syllabi, PowerPoint presentations, class materials and announcements. TWEN is also used for emailing, forum posting, live chats, polling, linking to CALI Lessons and posting/submitting assignments. (In terms of this range of functionality, TWEN is similar to other educational systems such as Blackboard, marketed by Blackboard Inc.).

Law school professors occasionally use it for their classes, and it is used by librarians and career services offices. Students can also create and manage their own courses for law reviews, journals and any student organization.

==Criticism and controversies==

===Identity theft controversy===
In February 2005, after the ChoicePoint identity theft incidents became public, U.S. Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) publicized the fact that Westlaw has a database containing a large amount of private information on practically all living Americans. Besides widely available information such as addresses and phone numbers, Westlaw also includes Social Security numbers (SSNs), previous addresses, dates of birth, and other information lawyers use to do background checks on behalf of their clients. While there is no known case of identity theft involving Westlaw, the company responded to the controversy by announcing it had eliminated access to full SSNs for 85 percent of its clients who previously could retrieve this information, mostly lawyers and government agencies.

===Legal disputes===
In the mid-1980s, Westlaw sued LexisNexis over copyright infringement. LexisNexis&#x27;s &quot;star pagination&quot; system, a feature that let users of either research system find the printed page of a case without looking to the actual book, was found to infringe West&#x27;s copyrights by the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. After Lexis&#x27; appeals were turned down by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, the company entered into an agreement to pay West $50,000 per year to license West&#x27;s pagination and text corrections. No other publisher was offered similar terms, and the terms of the agreement were kept secret until they came out during discovery in the &quot;Matthew Bender / HyperLaw v. West&quot; lawsuit.

In the mid-1990s, Alan Sugarman, who runs HyperLaw, sued West. The District Court in New York and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that West did not have copyright on the corrections it made on opinions or on the internal pagination.

<text>The Colossi of Memnon ( or &quot;es-Salamat&quot;) are two massive stone statues of the Pharaoh Amenhotep III, which stand at the front of the ruined Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III, the largest temple in the Theban Necropolis. They have stood since 1350 BC, and were well known to ancient Greeks and Romans, as well as early modern travelers and Egyptologists. The statues contain 107 Roman-era inscriptions in Greek and Latin, dated to between AD 20 and 250; many of these inscriptions on the northernmost statue make reference to the Greek mythological king Memnon, whom the statue was then – erroneously – thought to represent.

Scholars have debated how the identification of the northern colossus as &quot;Memnon&quot; is connected to the Greek name for the entire Theban Necropolis as the Memnonium.

== Description ==
The twin statues depict Amenhotep III (fl. 14th century BC) in a seated position, his hands resting on his knees and his gaze facing eastwards (actually ESE in modern bearings) towards the river. Three shorter figures are carved into the front throne alongside his legs: these are his wife Tiye and mother Mutemwiya. The middle between Amenhotep III&#x27;s ankles would have been an unidentified daughter, although it has been destroyed. The side panels depict the Nile god Hapi.

The statues are made from blocks of quartzite sandstone which was quarried at el-Gabal el-Ahmar (near modern-day Cairo) and transported overland to Thebes (Luxor). The stones are believed to be too heavy to have been transported upstream on the Nile. The blocks used by later Roman engineers to reconstruct the northern colossus may have come from Edfu (north of Aswan). Including the stone platforms on which they stand – themselves about – the colossi reach in height and weigh an estimated 720 tons each. The two figures are about apart. The size of the statues makes them visible up to over 10 miles away. Regarding their size; they stood as the guardians of Amenhotep III&#x27;s mortuary temple. Amenhotep III&#x27;s process of immortalizing himself in statuary was prevalent, His approach to statuary representation and inscriptions had supported his ideology as being much more than the king of kings. His titles repeatedly called him the &quot;good god&quot;. Suzanne Bickel describes the height of both colossi were accessible to the surrounding public as a method of allowing all to worship Amenhotep III himself and the gods at his temple.

Both statues are quite damaged, with the features above the waist virtually unrecognizable. The southern statue comprises a single piece of stone, but the northern figure has a large extensive crack in the lower half and above the waist consists of 5 tiers of stone. These upper levels consist of a different type of sandstone, and are the result of a later reconstruction attempt, which William de Wiveleslie Abney attributed to Septimius Severus. It is believed that originally the two statues were identical to each other, although inscriptions and minor art may have varied.

The original function of the Colossi was to stand guard at the entrance to Amenhotep&#x27;s memorial temple (or mortuary temple): a massive construct built during the pharaoh&#x27;s lifetime, where he was worshipped as a god-on-earth both before and after his departure from this world. In its day, this temple complex was the largest and most opulent in Ancient Egypt. Covering a total of , even later rivals such as Ramesses II&#x27;s Ramesseum or Ramesses III&#x27;s Medinet Habu were unable to match it in area; even the Temple of Karnak, as it stood in Amenhotep&#x27;s time, was smaller.

== Floods ==
Amenhotep III had positioned the mortuary temple in front of the floodplain of the Nile in an effort to fill a lake in front of the Colossi. Furthermore, this lake acted as a water retention reservoir and prevented the temple from flooding completely during high inundations. Hourig Sourouzian felt that Amenhotep III did not plan for the site to flood altogether as the surrounding wall for the mortuary temple behind the Colossi was constructed primarily of mud brick.

With the exception of the Colossi, however, very little remains today of Amenhotep&#x27;s temple. It stood on the edge of the Nile floodplain, and successive annual inundations gnawed away at its foundations – a 1840s lithograph by David Roberts shows the Colossi surrounded by water – and it was not unknown for later rulers to dismantle, purloin, and reuse portions of their predecessors&#x27; monuments.

== Roman era inscriptions ==
The statues contain 107 Roman-era inscriptions in Greek and Latin, dated between 20-250CE; these inscriptions allowed modern travellers to connect the statues to the classical Greek and Latin literature. Many of the inscriptions include the name &quot;Memnon&quot;. Several of the inscriptions refer to sounds emitted by the statues, the most famous being poetry by Julia Balbilla recording multiple visits during November 130 CE in a party that included the Emperor Hadrian and his wife Vibia Sabina. Of the 107 Roman-era inscriptions: 61 of them are written in Greek, 45 are written in Latin, and one bilingual text is written.

They were first studied in detail by Jean-Antoine Letronne in his 1831 &quot;La statue vocale de Memnon considérée dans ses rapports avec l&#x27;Égypte et la Grèce&quot; and then catalogued in the second volume (1848) of his &quot;Recueil des inscriptions grecques et latines de l&#x27;Égypte&quot;.
== Earthquakes ==

Soon after its construction the temple was destroyed by an earthquake, recently dated by the Armenian Institute of Seismology to around 1200 BC, which left only the two huge colossi at the entrance still standing. These were further destroyed by an earthquake in 27 BC, after which they were partly reconstructed by the Roman authorities.

The 1200 BC earthquake also opened numerous chasms in the ground which meant that many statues were buried, some in pristine condition. These have been the subject of extensive restoration and excavation conducted by the Armenian/German archaeologist Hourig Sourouzian, who has revealed that the complex consisted of three pylons, each fronted by colossal statues, while at the far end a rectangular Temple complex consisted of a peristyle court surrounded by columns. So far four of the statues have been re-erected, with eight waiting to be re-erected, while some 200 statues or pieces of statues are in the Luxor Museum, some on display, others in store awaiting conservation.

== Name ==
The modern Arabic name is Kom el-Hatan, but it is generally known by the Roman name as the Temple of Memnon. Memnon was a hero of the Trojan War and King of Ethiopia, who led his armies from Africa into Asia Minor to help defend the beleaguered city of Troy but was ultimately slain by Achilles. Memnon (whose name means or ) was said to be the son of Eos, the goddess of dawn. He was associated with colossi built several centuries earlier, because of the reported cry at dawn of the northern statue (see below), which became known as the . Eventually, the entire Theban Necropolis became generally referred to as the Memnonium making him &quot;Ruler of the west&quot; as in the case of the god Osiris who was called chief of the west.

in the 19th century, William de Wiveleslie Abney noted that &quot;(t)he Arabs called these statues &#x27;Shama&#x27; and &#x27;Tama&#x27;, and when speaking of them together gave them the appelation of Sanamât, or the idols.&quot;

== Sounds ==

In 27 BCE, a large earthquake reportedly shattered the northern colossus, collapsing it from the waist up and cracking the lower half. Following its rupture, the remaining lower half of this statue was then reputed to &quot;sing&quot; on various occasions – always within an hour or two of sunrise, usually right at dawn. The sound was most often reported in February or March, but this is probably more a reflection of the tourist season rather than any actual pattern.

The earliest report in literature is that of the Greek historian and geographer Strabo, who said that he heard the sound during a visit in 20 BCE, by which time it apparently was already well-known. The description varied; Strabo said it sounded &quot;like a blow&quot;, Pausanias compared it to &quot;the string of a lyre&quot; breaking, but it also was described as the striking of brass or whistling. Other ancient sources include Pliny (not from personal experience, but he collected other reports), Pausanias, Tacitus, Philostratus and Juvenal. In addition, the base of the statue is inscribed with about 90 surviving inscriptions of contemporary tourists reporting whether they had heard the sound or not.

The legend of the &quot;Vocal Memnon&quot;, the luck that hearing it was reputed to bring, and the reputation of the statue&#x27;s oracular powers became known outside of Egypt, and a constant stream of visitors, including several Roman emperors, came to marvel at the statues. The last recorded reliable mention of the sound dates from 196. Sometime later in the Roman era, the upper tiers of sandstone were added (the original remains of the top half have never been found); the date of this reconstruction is unknown, but local tradition places it circa 199, and attributes it to the Roman Emperor Septimius Severus in an attempt to curry favour with the oracle (it is known that he visited the statue, but did not hear the sound).

Various explanations have been offered for the phenomenon; these are of two types: natural or man-made. Strabo himself apparently was too far away to be able to determine its nature: he reported that he could not determine if it came from the pedestal, the shattered upper area, or &quot;the people standing around at the base&quot;. If natural, the sound was probably caused by rising temperatures and the evaporation of dew inside the porous rock.

Similar sounds, although much rarer, have been heard from some of the other Egyptian monuments (Karnak is the usual location for more modern reports). Perhaps the most convincing argument against it being the result of human agents is that it did cease, probably due to the added weight of the reconstructed upper tiers.

Since the northernmost statue is commonly associated with the renowned acoustic phenomenon, much of the literature and cultural discourse tends to overlook the southern counterpart. Despite its significance as a key structure commissioned by Amenhotep III, this oversight persisted. As a result, many Greco-Roman travelers, drawn by the mystique of the site, would etch their names upon the colossi during their visits, leaving behind inscriptions that reflect their fascination and desire for posterity.

<text>Iosif Samuilovich Shklovsky (sometimes transliterated &quot;Josif, Josif, Shklovskii, Shklovskij&quot;; ; 1 July 1916 – 3 March 1985) was a Soviet astronomer and astrophysicist. He is remembered for his work in theoretical astrophysics and other topics, as well as for his 1962 book on extraterrestrial life, the revised and expanded version of which was co-authored by American astronomer Carl Sagan in 1966 as &quot;Intelligent Life in the Universe&quot;.

He won the Lenin Prize in 1960 and the Bruce Medal in 1972. Asteroid 2849 Shklovskij and the crater Shklovsky (on the Martian moon Phobos) are named in his honor. He was a Corresponding Member of Soviet Academy of Sciences since 1966.

==Early life==
Shklovsky was born in Hlukhiv, a city in the Ukrainian part of the Russian Empire, into a poor Ukrainian Jewish family. After graduating from the seven-year secondary school, he worked as a foreman on building Baikal Amur Mainline. In 1933 Shklovsky entered the Physico-Mathematical Faculty of the Moscow State University.

There he studied until 1938, when he took a Postgraduate Course at the Astrophysics Department of the Sternberg State Astronomical Institute and remained working in the Institute until the end of his life. He died in Moscow, aged 68.

==Research==
He specialized in theoretical astrophysics and radio astronomy, as well as the Sun&#x27;s corona, supernovae, and cosmic rays and their origins. He showed, in 1946, that the radio-wave radiation from the Sun emanates from the ionized layers of its corona, and he developed a mathematical method for discriminating between thermal and nonthermal radio waves in the Milky Way. He is noted especially for his suggestion that the radiation from the Crab Nebula is due to synchrotron radiation, in which unusually energetic electrons twist through magnetic fields at speeds close to that of light. Shklovsky proposed that cosmic rays from supernova explosions within 300 light years of the sun could have been responsible for some of the mass extinctions of life on earth.

In 1959, Shklovsky examined the orbital motion of Mars&#x27;s inner satellite Phobos. He concluded that its orbit was decaying, and noted that if this decay was attributed to friction with the Martian atmosphere, then the satellite must have an exceptionally low density. In this context, he voiced a suggestion that Phobos might be hollow, and possibly of artificial origin. This interpretation has since been refuted by more detailed study, but the apparent suggestion of extraterrestrial involvement caught the public imagination, though there is some disagreement as to how seriously Shklovsky intended the idea to be taken. However, Shklovsky and Carl Sagan argued for serious consideration of &quot;paleocontact&quot; with extraterrestrials in the early historical era, and for examination of myths and religious lore for evidence of such contact.

His 1962 book, Вселенная, жизнь, разум (&quot;Universe, Life, Intelligence&quot;), was expanded upon and re-issued in 1966 with American astronomer Carl Sagan as co-author under the title &quot;Intelligent Life in the Universe&quot; (1966). This was the first comprehensive discussion of this field. Discussing the biological as well as astronomical issues of the subject, its unique format, alternating paragraphs written by Shklovsky and Sagan, demonstrated the deep mutual regard between the two and allowed them to express their views without compromise.

In 1967, before the discovery of pulsars, Shklovsky examined the X-ray and optical observations of Scorpius X-1 and correctly concluded that the radiation comes from an accreting neutron star.

==Quotes==
In the September 1965 issue of &quot;Soviet Life&quot;, he made the following statement regarding prospects for the future of humanity:

:&quot;Profound crises lie in wait for a developing civilization and one of them may well prove fatal. We are already familiar with several such critical (situations):&quot;
::&quot;(a) Self-destruction as a result of a thermonuclear catastrophe or some other discovery which may have unpredictable and uncontrollable consequences.&quot;
::&quot;(b) Genetic danger.&quot;
::&quot;(c) Overproduction of information.&quot;
::&quot;(d) Restricted capacity of the individual&#x27;s brain which can lead to excessive specialization, with consequent dangers of degeneration.&quot;
::&quot;(e) A crisis precipitated by the creation of artificial intelligent beings.&quot;

==Personal life==
His memoir, &quot;Five Billion Vodka Bottles to the Moon: Tales of a Soviet Scientist,&quot; was published posthumously in 1991 by W.W. Norton &amp; Co.

In &quot;Five Billion Vodka Bottles to the Moon&quot;, Shklovsky recalled his visit to Philip Morrison, who in 1959 had co-authored with Cornell University colleague Giuseppe Cocconi the paper in Nature magazine which marks the beginning of the modern search for extraterrestrial life, and their discussion of such issues. Bitter over Soviet anti-semitism, of the five pioneer investigators of the field, Cocconi, Morrison, Cornell University&#x27;s Frank Drake (of the 1961 Project Ozma and the Drake equation), Sagan, and Shklovsky, Shklovsky was quite aware of sharing his Jewish identity with Sagan. Indeed, Sagan&#x27;s Jewish heritage was also Ukrainian Jewish.

He was known for his sharp wit and extreme likability. Colleagues in the astronomy department at the University of California, Berkeley, remember fondly his visit there in the 1970s. Well known for his &quot;Intelligent Life in the Universe&quot;, he was asked by a graduate student if UFO sightings are as common in the Soviet Union as in the United States. &quot;No,&quot; he replied. &quot;In this area the Americans are far more advanced than us.&quot;

==Geography==

Xylokastro is situated on the coast of the Gulf of Corinth, 30 km northwest of Corinth, near the mouth of the river Trikalitikos. Apart from the narrow strip of land along the coast, where the town Xylokastro lies, the municipal unit is mountainous. The Greek National Road 8a (Corinth - Patras) passes through the town. The Xylokastro railway station is served by trains between Kiato and Aigio.

==History==

The town took its name from a wooden castle (), probably built in the 13th century. It was also known as Solo Castro. The village Stylia was known as &quot;Viladusa&quot; by the Venetians in the 18th century.

==People==
* Vlassis Bonatsos (1949 - October 14, 2004 in Athens, Greece), a Greek actor

<doc id="483222" wikidata="Q3366499" url="?curid=483222" title="Manitoba Liberal Party">
<text>The Manitoba Liberal Party () is a political party in Manitoba, Canada. Its roots can be traced to the late 19th century, following the province&#x27;s creation in 1870.

==History==
=== Origins and early development (to 1883) ===
Originally, there were no official political parties in Manitoba, although many leading politicians were affiliated with parties that existed at the national level. In Manitoba&#x27;s first Legislative Assembly (1871–1874), the leader of the opposition was Edward Hay, a Liberal who represented the interests of recent anglophone immigrants from Ontario. Not a party leader as such, he was still a leading voice for the newly transplanted &quot;Ontario Grit&quot; tradition. In 1874, Hay served as Minister of Public Works in the government of Marc-Amable Girard, which included both Conservatives and Liberals.

During the 1870s, a Liberal network began to emerge in the city of Winnipeg. One of the key figures in this network was William Luxton, owner of the Manitoba Free Press newspaper and himself a member of the Manitoba legislature on two occasions. Luxton was not initially supportive of Premier Robert A. Davis (1874–1878), but endorsed the Davis ministry after he brought John Norquay into cabinet (Davis&#x27; early supporters were primarily from the francophone community, and Norquay&#x27;s presence gave the ministry greater credibility among the anglophone population). Luxton subsequently supported Davis and Norquay against Conservative Orangeman Thomas Scott, a leader of the local opposition (not to be confused with the figure executed by Louis Riel in 1870).

Although the Davis administration was on favourable terms with federal Liberal Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie (1873–1878), his successor Norquay was more closely aligned with the federal Conservatives. This was partly a matter of necessity. As a small province, Manitoba needed to be on favourable terms with whatever party was in power at the federal level. As such, when John A. Macdonald&#x27;s Conservatives were returned to power in 1878, the local balance of power began to shift. Luxton&#x27;s Liberal network supported Norquay against Scott in 1878 and 1879, but was subsequently marginalized by the Norquay government. In 1882, Norquay forged a new alliance with the province&#x27;s Conservatives.

=== Leadership of Thomas Greenway (1883–1904) ===
In 1882, Thomas Greenway formed a new organization known as the Provincial Rights Party, which called for greater provincial control over resources and the railway.

Based in the province&#x27;s rural areas, this group soon surpassed the Winnipeg Liberals as the dominant opposition to Norquay. After the election of 1883, Greenway united the opposition MLAs into the Manitoba Liberals (which were soon recognized as a &quot;de facto&quot; political party). For the next 21 years, Greenway&#x27;s control over the party would be unchallenged.

Following the 1888 general election, Greenway&#x27;s Liberals took power and formed Manitoba&#x27;s first declared partisan government. As premier, Greenway ended federal disallowance of Manitoba railway legislation and the Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s monopoly, bringing the Northern Pacific into the province to induce competition in freight rates.

The Greenway government&#x27;s most notable feat in office was curtailing the rights of Manitoba&#x27;s French Canadian population. Manitoba had been founded as a bilingual province, but Greenway&#x27;s government provoked the Manitoba Schools Question, ending the educational rights of (predominantly French) Catholics, and making the public school system entirely English and Protestant. English became the province&#x27;s sole official language.

Greenway was able to win large majorities in 1892 and 1896, based largely on single-issue populism relating to the schools question. After this was resolved in 1897, his government became increasingly directionless.

In 1899, the Liberals were defeated by the Hugh John Macdonald-led Manitoba Conservative Party.

The Liberals were unable to regain their previous support base in the decade that followed. Greenway continued to lead the party through a disastrous 1903 campaign, winning only 9 seats. He resigned in 1904 to run for federal office as MP for Lisgar.

=== Early 20th century ===
Charles Mickle was chosen parliamentary leader on December 5, 1904, and led the party until a provincial convention was held in late March 1906. That convention acclaimed Edward Brown as the party&#x27;s new leader. Brown failed to win a seat in the 1907 election, however, and resigned shortly thereafter. Mickle again became the party&#x27;s legislative leader, and served as leader of the opposition until leaving politics in 1909.

Tobias Norris became Liberal leader in 1910. When the Tories under Rodmond Roblin resigned amid scandal in 1915, Norris became the province&#x27;s premier, and retained the position until 1922. The Norris Liberals introduced temperance laws, suffrage for women, workers compensation, compulsory education, and minimum wage, as well as the establishment of a public-nursing system, rural farm credit, regulation of industrial conditions, and a mother&#x27;s allowance for widowed dependent mothers.

The Norris administration&#x27;s relationship with the Liberal Party of Canada under Wilfrid Laurier was often antagonistic. Norris withdrew funding for French-language education in 1916, at a time when the federal Liberals were attempting to regain the support of Quebec nationalists. The Manitoba Liberals also supported Robert Borden&#x27;s Union government in the election of 1917 (see Conscription Crisis of 1917), and were not reconciled with the &quot;Laurier Liberals&quot; until 1922. Even then, they refused to officially re-align themselves with the federal party.

The Liberals were swept from power in 1922 by the United Farmers of Manitoba, who were also known as the Progressive Party. Norris continued to lead the party through most of the 1920s, but was replaced by Hugh Robson before the 1927 election (which was again won by the Progressives). Robson, in turn, resigned on January 3, 1930. He was replaced as parliamentary leader by James Breakey. In 1931, Murdoch Mackay was selected as the party&#x27;s official leader.

=== Liberal-Progressive Party: Merger with the Progressives ===
Pressured by William Lyon Mackenzie King, Mackay brought the Liberals into a coalition with Premier John Bracken&#x27;s Progressives before the 1932 election. The national Progressive Party had been largely absorbed into the Liberal Party of Canada by this time, and King believed that it was foolish to divide the resources of the parties within Manitoba. He was especially concerned that the Conservatives could recapture the provincial government if the Liberals and Progressives were not united.

For the election of 1932, the provincial government referred to itself as &quot;Liberal-Progressive&quot; (effectively a fusion of the parties, albeit one dominated by Progressives). A small group of Liberals, led by St. Boniface mayor David Campbell, opposed the merger and ran as &quot;Continuing Liberals&quot;. They were resoundingly defeated. After the election, the Liberals of Manitoba were absorbed into the Progressive Party. Two non-coalition Liberals were elected in 1936, but they were not intended to represent a rival party.

Despite being dominated by Progressives, the merged party soon became popularly known as the &quot;Liberal Party of Manitoba&quot;. The federal Progressive Party had long since disappeared, and the &quot;Progressive&quot; name had little continued meaning in Manitoba politics.

==== 1940s and 1950s ====
In 1940, Bracken&#x27;s Liberal-Progressives forged an even broader coalition, bringing the Conservatives, Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, and Social Credit in a &quot;non-partisan&quot; government. This coalition governed the province until 1950, although the CCF left in 1943.

The Liberal-Progressive governments were cautious and moderate. Bracken&#x27;s government undertook few major initiatives, and was unfriendly to labour issues even during its alliance with the CCF. Following World War II, the government of Stuart Garson (who replaced Bracken as premier in January 1943) led a program of rapid rural electrification, but was otherwise as cautious as Bracken&#x27;s. Garson left provincial politics in 1948 to join the federal Liberal Cabinet of Louis St. Laurent.

The government of Garson&#x27;s successor, Douglas Lloyd Campbell, was socially conservative and generally opposed to state intervention of any sort. The educational system remained primitive (it was dominated by one-room schoolhouses well into the 1950s), and no significant steps were taken on language or labour issues. The province did modernize its liquor laws during this period, however. Despite its Liberal-Progressive label, Campbell&#x27;s government was one of the most right-wing provincial governments in Canada. It had somewhat frosty relations with the federal Liberals in the 1950s despite Garson being an influential cabinet minister.

The Liberal-Progressives lost their majority in the 1958 provincial election by the Progressive Conservatives under Dufferin Roblin. Campbell initially hoped to stay in office with a minority government supported by the CCF, but this was brought to nothing, and the CCF threw its support to a PC minority government. However, the Manitoba PCs were dominated by Red Tories, and Roblin&#x27;s government was actually well to the left of Campbell&#x27;s government.

=== Manitoba Liberal Party: Declining popularity (1960s–1970s) ===
Gildas Molgat, a protégé of Campbell, became party leader in 1961. Earlier that year, the party had formally renamed itself as simply the &quot;Manitoba Liberal Party,&quot; over only scattered objections from Progressive diehards. Molgat prevented the Liberals from falling to third-party status during the 1960s, but never posed a serious threat to Roblin&#x27;s government.

Robert Bend, a former minister under Campbell, came out of retirement to lead the party in 1969. However, Bend&#x27;s rural populism did not play well with urban voters. Under his leadership, the party adopted a &quot;cowboy&quot;/&quot;rodeo&quot; theme for the campaign, which made it look and sound dated. The election that followed was an unmitigated disaster; the party dropped to only five seats, the fewest it had ever won. Bend himself was unsuccessful in his bid to succeed Campbell in his own riding. A succession of leaders, including Israel Asper (1970–1975), Charles Huband (1975–1978), and Doug Lauchlan (1980–1982) were unable to prevent the party&#x27;s decline.

Well into the 1970s, the party was considered very right-wing for its time, despite the Liberal label. This was especially true under Asper&#x27;s leadership; during his tenure as party leader Asper supported laissez-faire economics and an end to the welfare state—putting it to the right of the Tories. The party largely distanced itself from its right-wing past in the mid-1970s. By this time, however, the province was polarized between the Tories and the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP, successor to the Manitoba CCF), and the Liberals were unable to present themselves as a viable alternative. The party bottomed out in the 1981 election, when it was completely shut out of the legislature for the first time ever.

=== 1980s–1990 ===
In 1984, the party chose Sharon Carstairs as its new leader. She was elected to the assembly in the 1986 election, and in the 1988 election, led the party to 20 seats—its best showing since 1953—and official opposition status. This was precipitated by the unpopularity of Howard Pawley&#x27;s New Democratic government, which allowed the Liberals to win the support of many centre-left voters.

The Liberals&#x27; resurgence sparked hopes that they could win the next election. This proved to be a temporary recovery. The NDP revived under Gary Doer, and the Liberals slipped back into third place in the 1990 election with only seven seats, against 20 for the NDP and 30 for the Conservatives. Many in the party felt Carstairs had squandered their best chance of winning government in three decades.

=== Further decline (1993–2013) ===
Carstairs was replaced as leader by Paul Edwards in 1993. By the time the 1995 election was called, the party had managed to recover to a strong second-place position in the polls. They ran a poor campaign, however, and were again overtaken by the NDP well before election day. Despite having almost 24% of popular support, the Liberals won only three seats and lost official party status. Edwards, who was defeated in his own riding, stepped down as party leader in 1996.

The leadership convention of 1996 exposed deep divisions in the party, as Ginny Hasselfield defeated Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Kevin Lamoureux by only 21 votes. Two of the party&#x27;s three MLAs (Lamoureux and Gary Kowalski) subsequently sat as &quot;Independent Liberals&quot;, and there were threats of legal action between Hasselfield and Lamoureux. The party was only reunited when Hasselfield resigned in 1998, replaced by former federal Member of Parliament (MP) Jon Gerrard.

Liberal Party support fell by 10% in the election of 1999, which allowed Gary Doer&#x27;s New Democrats to regain centre-left support and win government. Gerrard became the party&#x27;s only MLA, winning election in the upscale riding of River Heights, Carstairs&#x27; old riding. The party failed to recover much of its support base in the 2003 election, although Lamoureux was able to regain his seat in north Winnipeg to become the party&#x27;s second MLA.

Despite Lamoureux&#x27;s re-election, the Liberal popular vote fell in 2003 even through the party managed to field a full slate of candidates (they were 7 shy in 1999). The Liberals did have more second-place finishes than in the previous election, which appeared to be a sign of a rebound. If the party had any momentum to build upon, it was negated by a weak campaign in the 2007 provincial election. Gerrard and Lamoureux were both re-elected, but the party&#x27;s popular support declined to just above 12%. They also had fewer second-place finishes than they had in 1999.

=== Minor party (2010s–present) ===
The 2011 provincial election resulted in Jon Gerrard being the only Liberal MLA being elected. He subsequently announced his intention to resign as party leader after serving in the position for 15 years.

On October 26, 2013, the Manitoba Liberal Party held a leadership convention in Winnipeg. The contested nomination saw three individuals put their name forward: Bob Axworthy (younger brother of Lloyd Axworthy, former MP, federal Minister of various portfolios, and MLA), Rana Bokhari, and Dougald Lamont. Bokhari was elected leader of the party with 431 ballots cast.

In preparation of the 2016 Manitoba general election, the Liberals nominated candidates in all 57 ridings. The party initially had high hopes for the election after a strong showing by the federal Liberals in the 2015 federal election, in which they took all but one seat in Winnipeg. By the time of the writ, Elections Manitoba disqualified four candidates due to improper paperwork and a fifth for being an enumerator while collecting signatures for her candidacy. The Liberals found their pre-writ polling of approximately 25% fall to 14% on Election Day, gaining two seats. Bokhari would finish third in her own seat of Fort Rouge. On May 7, 2016, Bokhari announced that she would not lead the party into the next election but would remain on as leader until her successor was chosen, though she would ultimately resign in September to enter the private sector. Judy Klassen, one of the two new Liberal MLAs elected in 2016 along with Cindy Lamoureux, served as the interim leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party until June 13, 2017, when she stepped down to become a leadership candidate. Dougald Lamont would ultimately be elected Manitoba Liberal leader at the October 21, 2017 Liberal leadership election, defeating Cindy Lamoureux on the second ballot by eight votes.

On July 17, 2018, Lamont won a by-election in St. Boniface, becoming the party&#x27;s fourth MLA and giving the Liberals official party status for the first time in 23 years. The by-election followed the resignation of former NDP Premier Greg Selinger.

Lamont led the Manitoba Liberals into the 2019 provincial election with four MLAs, though Judy Klassen would not seek re-election. The three other incumbent Liberal MLA were returned, with Lamont being re-elected in St. Boniface, while Gerrard was re-elected in River Heights, and Cindy Lamoureux won in Tyndall Park. 

Lamont remained the Liberal leader into the 2023 provincial election. The party, however, would suffer a nearly four-point swing away in terms of vote percentage and would return only one MLA, as the New Democrats were swept into power. Gerrard and Lamont lost their seats to New Democrats Mike Moroz and Robert Loiselle respectively, though Lamoureux improved her vote percentage by a small margin. Lamont would resign as leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party that evening. Gerrard&#x27;s defeat in River Heights would mark the first time a New Democrat held the seat, the first time since 1999 that a Liberal would not, and only the second time since 1986 that a Liberal would not hold the seat after PC MLA Mike Radcliffe held the seat from 1995 to 1999.

On October 17, 2023, Cindy Lamoureux was appointed as the interim party leader.

<doc id="483232" wikidata="Q701503" url="?curid=483232" title="Prince Yasuhiko Asaka">
<text>was the founder of a collateral branch of the Japanese Imperial Family and a general in the Imperial Japanese Army during the Japanese invasion of China and the Second World War. He was the son-in-law of Emperor Meiji and uncle by marriage of Emperor Hirohito. As the commander of Japanese forces outside Nanjing in December 1937, Asaka presided over the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers and civilians in what came to be known as the Nanjing Massacre.

After Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II, General Douglas MacArthur granted immunity to the country&#x27;s Imperial Family. As a result, Asaka was never tried for his involvement in the Nanjing Massacre by SCAP authorities. Nonetheless, by 1947, he and his children were stripped of their imperial status. He later converted to Catholicism and died of natural causes at the age of 93.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Prince Yasuhiko came from Kyoto, the eighth son of Prince Kuni Asahiko and the court lady Tsunoda Sugako. Prince Kuni Asahiko was the youngest prince descended from the Fushimi-no-miya, one of the four branch houses of the imperial dynasty &quot;(shinnōke)&quot; entitled to provide a successor to the throne. In 1872, the Emperor Meiji granted him the title Kuni-no-miya and authorization to begin a new collateral branch of the imperial family. Prince Yasuhiko was a half-brother of Prince Higashikuni Naruhiko, Prince Nashimoto Morimasa, Prince Kaya Kuninori, and Prince Kuni Kuniyoshi, the father of the future Empress Kōjun, the consort of Emperor Shōwa (Hirohito).

=== Marriage and family ===
On 10 March 1906, the Emperor Meiji granted Prince Yasuhiko the title Asaka-no-miya and authorization to begin a new branch of the imperial family. On 6 May 1909, Prince Asaka married Nobuko, Princess Fumi (7 August 1891 – 3 November 1933), the eighth daughter of Emperor Meiji. Prince and Princess Asaka had four children:

# ; married in 1931 Marquis Nabeshima Naoyasu.
# ; married Todo Chikako, the fifth daughter of Count Todo Takatsugu. They had two daughters, Fukuko and Minoko and a son Tomohiko.
# , renounced membership in the imperial family and created Marquis Otowa, 1936. Killed in action during the Battle of Kwajalein.
# ; married Count Ogyu Yoshiatsu.

===Military career===
Like the other imperial princes of the Meiji period, it was expected that Prince Yasuhiko would pursue a career in the military. He received his early education at the Gakushūin Peers&#x27; School and the Central Military Preparatory School, before graduating from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy on 27 May 1908. Commissioned a second lieutenant of infantry on 25 December, Prince Asaka was promoted to lieutenant in December 1910, captain in August 1913, major in July 1918, and lieutenant-colonel in August 1922.

Between 1920 and 1923, Prince Asaka studied military tactics at the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in France, along with his half-brother Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni and his cousin Prince Naruhisa Kitashirakawa (1887–1923). However, on 1 April 1923, he was seriously injured in an automobile accident in Perriers-la-Campagne (Normandy) that killed Prince Kitashirakawa; the accident left Prince Asaka with a limp for the rest of his life.
Princess Asaka traveled to France to nurse her husband. Prince and Princess Asaka also visited the United States in 1925. During that period, Prince and Princess Asaka became enthralled with the Art Deco movement. Upon returning to Japan that same year, The Prince and Princess began arranging for a new mansion to be built in the Art Deco style in Tokyo&#x27;s Shirokanedai neighborhood. The house, currently the Tokyo Metropolitan Teien Art Museum, was completed in May 1933, but Princess Asaka died a few months later.

While these events were occurring, Prince Asaka had risen through the ranks of the military. After being promoted to the rank of colonel in August 1925, in December 1929, he rose to the rank of major general and was subsequently appointed an instructor at the Army Staff College in 1930. On 1 August 1933, he was promoted to lieutenant general and assumed command of the First Imperial Guards Division. In December 1935, he was appointed a member of the Supreme War Council, which gave him a very influential position with Emperor Hirohito.

However, during the abortive February 26 Incident in 1936, Prince Asaka pressed the Emperor to appoint a new government that would be acceptable to the rebels, especially by replacing Prime Minister Keisuke Okada with Kōki Hirota. The Prince&#x27;s pro-Imperial Way Faction political sentiments, as well as his connections to other right-wing army cliques, caused a rift between himself and the Emperor. It was perhaps due to this rift that Prince Asaka was transferred to the Japanese Central China Area Army (under the aging General Iwane Matsui) in China in 1937.

===Role in the Nanjing Massacre===
In November 1937, Prince Asaka became temporary commander of the Japanese forces outside Nanjing, then capital of China, because General Matsui was ill. As temporary commander of the final assault on Nanjing between 2 and 6 December 1937, he issued the order to &quot;kill all captives&quot;, thus providing official sanction for what became known as the &quot;Nanjing Massacre&quot; or the &quot;Rape of Nanjing&quot; (12 December 1937 – 10 February 1938).

While Prince Asaka&#x27;s responsibility for the Nanjing Massacre remains a matter of debate, the sanction for the massacre and the crimes committed during the invasion of China might ultimately be found in the ratification, made on 5 August 1937 by Emperor Hirohito, of the proposition of the Japanese army to remove the constraints of international law on the treatment of Chinese prisoners.In February 1938, both Prince Asaka and General Matsui were recalled to Japan. Matsui went into virtual retirement, but Prince Asaka remained on the Supreme War Council until the end of the war in August 1945. He was promoted to the rank of general in August 1939 but held no further military commands. In 1944, he colluded with Prince Higashikuni, his nephew Prince Takamatsu, and former Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe (1895–1945) to oust the Hideki Tojo cabinet.

====Immunity from prosecution====
Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers (SCAP) officials interrogated Prince Asaka about his involvement in the Nanjing Massacre on 1 May 1946, but did not bring him before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East for prosecution. Indeed, for politico-strategic and geopolitical reasons, General Douglas MacArthur decided to support the Imperial family and to grant immunity to all its members. Matsui, on the other hand, was tried, convicted, and executed for failing to prevent the massacre.

===Postwar life as a commoner===
On 14 October 1947, Asaka Yasuhiko and his children lost their imperial status and privileges and became ordinary citizens, as part of the American Occupation&#x27;s abolition of the collateral branches of the Japanese Imperial family. He and his son were purged from holding any political or public office because they had been officers in the Imperial Japanese Army. His Art Deco mansion in Shirokanedai was seized by the government and now houses the Tokyo Metropolitan Teien Art Museum.

The former prince, Asaka Yasuhiko, moved to Atami, on the Izu Peninsula south of Tokyo. Asaka converted to Catholicism on 18 December 1951, and he was the first Imperial clansman to do so. He spent most of his time playing golf. He also took an active interest in golf course development and in the 1950s was the architect of the Plateau Golf Course at the Dai-Hakone Country Club. Asaka Yasuhiko died of natural causes on 12 April 1981 at his home in Atami, Shizuoka prefecture. He was 93 years old.

<text>Carswell is a Canadian information source servicing legal, tax, accounting, and human resource professionals. Founded in 1864, it was purchased by the International Thomson Organization in 1987, and has since been a subsidiary of its successors, The Thomson Corporation (1989-2008), and Thomson Reuters (2008-).

==Modern day==
Carswell offers products, services, customized training, and technical support to practitioners and organizations across Canada and beyond. With headquarters in Toronto, Ontario, Carswell provides products and services in a range of formats, including books, looseleaf services, journals, newsletters, CD-ROMs, and online products. Les Éditions Yvon Blais, a specialized legal publisher in the Quebec market, has been part of Carswell since 1996. Lexpert, Canada&#x27;s leading source of news and information about the business of law, was acquired in 2004 then subsequently sold in 2019 to HAB Press, a division of Key Media. The Cyberbahn Group, a leading provider of corporate and commercial searches, company registrations, and litigation services in Canada, joined Carswell in 2008 and was later sold to Dye &amp; Durham in 2019. Canada Law Book joined Carswell in 2010.

Carswell was named one of Canada&#x27;s 50 Best Employers by The Globe and Mail Report on Business magazine in 2004, 2005, and 2006. Maclean&#x27;s Magazine named Carswell one of Canada&#x27;s Top 100 Employers and one of Greater Toronto&#x27;s Top Employers.

<doc id="483242" wikidata="Q313410" url="?curid=483242" title="European route E55">
<text>European route E55 is an E-route. It passes through the following cities:
Helsingborg ... Helsingør – Copenhagen – Køge – Vordingborg – Nykøbing Falster – Gedser ... Rostock – Berlin – Lübbenau – Dresden – Teplice – Prague – Tábor – Linz – Salzburg – Villach – Tarvisio – Udine – Palmanova – Venice – Ravenna – Cesena – Rimini – Fano – Ancona – Pescara – Canosa di Puglia – Bari – Brindisi ... Igoumenitsa – Preveza – Rhion – Patrai – Pyrgos – Kalamáta.

From Helsingborg, the route was supposed to continue northward through Sweden and into Finland, but a decision was made to keep the E4 designation in Sweden, formerly used for a European route from Lisbon to Helsinki. The E55 is not and has not been signposted in Sweden. Since 2018, the E55 is not signposted between Helsingør and Køge in Denmark, but is signposted south of Køge.

<text>A slipmat is a circular piece of slippery cloth or synthetic materials disk jockeys place on the turntable platter instead of the traditional rubber mat.

Unlike the rubber mat which is made to hold the record firmly in sync with the rotating platter, slipmats are designed to slip on the platter, allowing the DJ to manipulate a record on a turntable while the platter continues to rotate underneath. This is useful for holding a record still for slip-cueing, making minute adjustments during beatmatching and mixing and pulling the record back and forth for scratching. They are also very commonly used simply as decoration for when a record isn&#x27;t on the turntable.

The slipmat was invented by hip-hop pioneer Grandmaster Flash to improve its sound and move the vinyl counterclockwise without causing too much drag and too much friction. In a Washington Post interview, he recalls “My mother was a seamstress so I knew different types of materials,” he continues. Having settled on felt, Flash encountered another issue. “The problem with felt is that it draped, it was limp,” he recalls. “So I ran home and got a copy of my album and I bought just enough felt to cut out two round circles the same size as a 33’ LP and—when my mother wasn&#x27;t looking—I turned the iron all the way up high and I used my mother&#x27;s spray starch. I sprayed it until this limp piece of felt became—I called it a wafer, like what you get in church at Easter. Today it&#x27;s called a slipmat.”

<text>MLS Cup is the annual championship game of Major League Soccer (MLS) and the culmination of the MLS Cup playoffs. The game is held in November or December and pits the winner of the Eastern Conference Final against the winner of the Western Conference Final. The MLS Cup winner is awarded the title of league champion.

MLS uses a playoff tournament following the regular season to determine its annual league champion, a method used by other major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. This format differs from most soccer leagues around the world, which consider the club with the most points at the end of the season to be the champion; MLS honors that achievement with the Supporters&#x27; Shield.

The winner of MLS Cup is awarded one of the country&#x27;s four berths in the following season&#x27;s CONCACAF Champions Cup. The three Canadian teams of MLS do the same in addition to the zonal competition, the Leagues Cup, or with victory in the lock-out based Canadian Championship—if a team wins multiple berths, the Champions Cup berth tied to the game is passed on to the highest-placed U.S.-based team in the overall regular season table that did not already qualify.

The inaugural MLS Cup was held on October 20, 1996, in which D.C. United defeated the LA Galaxy. The Galaxy are the most successful team in MLS Cup history, winning a record sixth title in 2024.

Three trophy designs have been used for MLS Cup: the Alan I. Rothenberg Trophy from 1996 through 1998, a redesigned Alan I. Rothenberg Trophy from 1999 through 2007, and the Philip F. Anschutz Trophy since 2008.

==History==

=== D.C. United dynasty ===
MLS Cup&#x27;s roots trace back to the foundation of Major League Soccer, when the league decided to hold a championship format similar to its contemporary North American sports leagues. The first few editions of the game were dominated by D.C. United, who appeared in the first four MLS Cup finals, winning three.

The inaugural MLS Cup in 1996 featured D.C. United and LA Galaxy. The Galaxy went ahead 2–0 early in the second half, but their lead was relinquished towards the end of the match when Tony Sanneh pulled one back in the 72nd minute. Nine minutes later, Shawn Medved tied the match at two, resulting in overtime between the two sides. Four minutes into overtime, Eddie Pope gave United the golden goal victory.

In 1997, the second league cup final was contested at RFK Stadium, where United won back-to-back titles, a feat that would not be accomplished for another decade (when the Houston Dynamo won the 2006 and 2007 finals). The game ended 2–1 in United&#x27;s favor over the Colorado Rapids, who would not win a championship until 2010. Jaime Moreno was declared Man of the Match for his goal in the 37th minute of play. This season was also the first time in league history any MLS team won the regular season (Supporters&#x27; Shield) and postseason title in the same season.

D.C. United&#x27;s run ended the third year, when they made a third run to the MLS Cup finals, only to lose to the expansion side Chicago Fire by 2–0. However the following year, United repeated their &quot;double&quot; of winning both the Supporters Shield and MLS Cup the same season. This time, it was a 2–0 win over the Galaxy in the 1999 MLS Cup final.

=== Rise of the California Clásico ===

For the first time since 1997, the 2000 MLS Cup final saw a new club reach the finals along with the Fire. This time the Kansas City Wizards, now known as Sporting Kansas City, won their first MLS Cup with a 1–0 victory over the Fire.

From 2001 through 2005, the MLS Cup finals saw a rising of the California Clásico when intrastate rivals L.A. Galaxy and the San Jose Earthquakes clashed in the 2001 final. The match also saw the rise of U.S. national Landon Donovan who won a Newcomer of the Year award and tallied the equalizer in the Earthquakes 2–1 championship victory over the Galaxy.

With the largest crowd in MLS Cup history at hand, the New England Revolution took on the Galaxy in the 2002 finals. For the match, over 61,000 fans were in attendance at Gillette Stadium to witness the final. In the second period of sudden-death overtime, the Galaxy nabbed their first MLS Cup title, and sparked the start of a string of MLS Cup losses for the Revolution.

The 2003 final saw the league leaders for that season go head-to-head. Two clubs that had MLS Cup experience, the Fire and Earthquakes, played for the final that year. The two clubs had successful regular season campaigns with the Fire winning their first Supporters&#x27; Shield, and the Earthquakes being the Western Conference regular season and post-season champions as well as having the second best overall regular season record. In a hotly contested match, the Earthquakes won with their second MLS Cup title with a 4–2 score making it the highest scoring MLS Cup final in league history (six goals).

After a four-year absence, United made their fifth trip to MLS Cup, playing against the Wizards for MLS Cup 2004. The match had four goals scored in the first 25 minutes, with United rallying for a 3–1 lead. Midway through the second half, United had relinquished a penalty kick. Josh Wolff scored for Kansas City, bringing the game within a goal. D.C. United was able to retain the lead, by winning their fourth MLS Cup title, by a score of 3–2.

For the 2005 season, the Earthquakes, as the Supporters&#x27; Shield winners, fell to the Galaxy in the Playoffs. The Galaxy went on to win MLS Cup, matching the Earthquakes at two.

=== Format changes ===

Until 2005, the MLS Cup championship games had been dominated by clubs that had either won or had come close to winning the Supporters Shield. In the 2005 MLS Cup championship, the match was won by the LA Galaxy, which won the league title while having a ninth-place overall record. The Wizards had a better record, but did not qualify for the playoffs because they finished 5th in the Eastern Conference, in spite of an 8th-place overall record. The result prompted MLS to create new wild-cards that were used starting in 2006, where a certain number of clubs per conference could qualify, and the next best overall teams regardless of conference would also qualify. That prompted debates about the league switching to a single table and a balanced schedule. The single table has yet been instituted, but in 2010 the league instituted a balanced schedule. Starting in the 2012 season, the league resumed an unbalanced schedule.

=== Scudetto era ===

At the start of the 2006 season, MLS created their version of the &quot;scudetto&quot; (Italian for &quot;small shield&quot;), a symbol worn on the jersey by the team who won the previous season&#x27;s Serie A (the top Italian league).

The MLS scudetto was originally a curved, triangular badge featuring a backdrop of the American flag behind a replica of the Alan I. Rothenberg MLS Cup trophy. First worn by LA Galaxy in 2006, following their 2005 MLS Cup title, the Houston Dynamo wore the same triangular scudettos in 2007 and 2008 during their dual-cup run. It was redesigned after the 2008 season after the change to the MLS Cup trophy. It is now an oval-shaped black badge with the Philip F. Anschutz Trophy in the middle. The MLS scudetto was worn by the winning team the season following the victory. It is only during the subsequent season (two years after winning the championship), that the team adds a star – a common soccer signifier of titles won – above the team logo. The team can display the star on other items beside their jersey in the year after winning the Cup, but only if the scudetto is not shown. The Columbus Crew was the first team to wear the redesigned scudetto. Real Salt Lake wore the scudetto in 2010 after winning their first MLS cup in 2009. A year after the Colorado Rapids also wore it after their cup run in 2010 for the 2011 season. Finally, the LA Galaxy wore the scudetto after winning MLS Cup in 2011, ironically, it was the last team to do so. After the 2012 season, MLS decided not to use the scudetto for upcoming season and instead the defending MLS Cup champions would have a gold star above one or more silver stars indication the team&#x27;s MLS Cup wins, followed by an additional silver star added to the lined stars the following season. The LA Galaxy were the first to receive the gold star above the team&#x27;s three silver stars for the 2013 season.

=== &quot;Buffalo Bills&quot; of MLS ===

While the Galaxy won its second MLS Cup trophy and the Houston Dynamo earned consecutive cups, the New England Revolution went on a run of making three consecutive MLS Cup finals, losing all of them. Two of their three losses were in extra time, while the other was lost on penalty kicks. The infamy gave the club the title of being the Buffalo Bills (an NFL American football team) of MLS. This was in reference to the Buffalo Bills&#x27; Super Bowl games in the early 1990s, in which they lost in four consecutive appearances. In the 2005 final, the Revolution lost to the LA Galaxy, a rematch of 2002, in the final. In a match held at Pizza Hut Park (now Toyota Stadium) in Frisco, Texas, the Galaxy defeated the Revolution by a score of 1–0 thanks to a 105th-minute overtime goal from Galaxy midfielder and Guatemalan international, Guillermo Ramírez. Ramírez&#x27;s goal sealed the Galaxy&#x27;s second MLS Cup title, and left the Revs searching once again.

In 2006, the championship was once again played in Frisco at Pizza Hut Park. This time the Revolution took on the Houston Dynamo. Both were coming off a successful season in which they fell short of winning the Supporters&#x27; Shield. A sellout crowd of 22,427 attended the match. Revolution forward Taylor Twellman scored an overtime goal in the 113th minute to give the Revolution the 1–0 lead. However, Dynamo captain and forward Brian Ching immediately tied the score following the Revolution&#x27;s goal. The match went to penalties, in which the Dynamo won 4–3. This left the Revolution for a second consecutive year searching for league glory. It was also the first time in league history that a club lost consecutive MLS Cups.

In the 2007 final, the Revolution and Dynamo played each other once again for the 2007 cup. Played in Washington, D.C., at RFK Stadium, a crowd just shy of 40,000 witnessed the championship. The announced crowd of 39,859 made it the largest MLS Cup crowd since 2002. The Revolution had a successful season, earning its first U.S. Open Cup title. The Revolution wanted its first MLS Cup crown, and wanted to win its first &quot;Double&quot; in club history. Houston, finishing just shy once again to D.C. United of winning the MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield, was determined to finish its second season with some hardware, and to defend its MLS Cup title. The match went in the Revolution&#x27;s favor early on, as the Revolution&#x27;s captain, Twellman, netted in the 20th minute to give New England a 1–0 lead. However, midway through the second half, the Dynamo retaliated. Dynamo striker Joseph Ngwenya leveled things at one apiece in the 61st minute, and MLS Cup Man of the Match Dwayne De Rosario gave the Dynamo a 2–1 lead in the 74th. The goal proved to be the winning goal, as the Dynamo earned the first back-to-back MLS Cup titles since D.C. United in 1996 and 1997.

=== Underdogs winning the cup ===

Early in the 2008 Major League Soccer season, the league announced that the championship would be returning to The Home Depot Center (now known as Dignity Health Sports Park). Throughout the regular season, the league was dominated by the Columbus Crew, who finished the season with 57 points, and secured the Supporters&#x27; Shield title with three matches remaining before the 2008 MLS Cup Playoffs. Traditionally, the Shield winners only rarely made it to the league championship, in spite of usually being the heavy favorites going into the playoffs. However, for the first time in eight years, a regular season champion made it to MLS Cup. The Sigi Schmid-led club made their first run to the championship, along with their opponents the New York Red Bulls. For the Crew, being the Shield winners, their run to the final was a bit expected. The Red Bulls making the final was seen as a large surprise, possibly even a fluke. The Red Bulls did not qualify for the playoffs until the last day of the season, where they were the weakest team, in terms of regular season record, to qualify for the playoffs. The match ended up being dominated by the Crew as Columbus defeated New York with ease, 3–1. The point gap between the two clubs was the largest in history, and the scoreline between the two clubs made it tied for the largest margin of victory in MLS Cup history. New York&#x27;s run to the finals was further emphasized as a fluke when the club had the worst record in 2009.

The following championship saw two intra-conference clubs meet in the final for the second consecutive year, this time at Seattle&#x27;s Qwest Field (later CenturyLink Field and now Lumen Field). The Western Conference regular season and postseason champions, LA Galaxy took on Real Salt Lake, who finished fifth in the West. Although the Sounders FC management had originally planned on capping the seats available in Qwest Field to 35,700, surging demand led to the release of an additional 10,000 seats, expanding the total capacity to roughly 45,700. The announced crowd was 46,011. The crowd size was the first championship crowd since 2002 to draw over 45,000 spectators. Televised on ESPN, it was the first time that the MLS championship match was televised on the cable network; the first thirteen were carried on ABC. In the 41st minute, Galaxy striker Mike Magee scored, only for Salt Lake&#x27;s Robbie Findley to make the tying goal in the 61st. The stalemate was not broken in regulation nor overtime, requiring penalty kicks to decide the match. Thanks to a strike from Salt Lake&#x27;s Robbie Russell, Salt Lake won their first major trophy. By winning the championship, they gained entry into the 2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League. There, they made it to the final, only to lose to Monterrey of Mexico.

At the 2010 season&#x27;s end, six teams from the Western Conference qualified for the playoffs, whereas only two clubs from the East qualified, making it the largest disparity between the two conferences in league history. The league&#x27;s seeding at the time awarded conference winners earned the top seeds, the two weakest Western Conference teams, San Jose Earthquakes and Colorado Rapids were seeded against the Eastern Conference champion, New York Red Bulls and runner-up Columbus Crew, respectively. Some cited this as an unfair advantage for the Rapids and Earthquakes, as both teams made the semi-finals. In the end, the Rapids played FC Dallas for MLS Cup 2010, winning 2–1 in overtime.

=== LA Galaxy dynasty ===

Between the 2011 and 2014 MLS Cups, the LA Galaxy appeared in three MLS Cup finals, having the most success in MLS Cup in a short period of time since United&#x27;s late 1990s dynasty. The only final that the Galaxy did not win, came in 2013, where they lost in the 2013 Western Conference semi-finals to eventual runner-up, Real Salt Lake. During that time, the Galaxy became the first MLS franchise to win five MLS Cups, when they won MLS Cup 2014. These teams contained several high-profile players including Landon Donovan, Robbie Keane, Gyasi Zardes, David Beckham and Omar Gonzalez.

Some claim that the Galaxy&#x27;s dynasty began in 2009, when they reached the playoffs for the first time since 2005, and marched to the finals, only to lose on penalties to Real Salt Lake. In 2010, and again, in 2011, the Galaxy won consecutive Supporters&#x27; Shield, and completed the league double winning both the Shield and MLS Cup in 2011. This was the first time this had been accomplished since the Columbus Crew achieved it in 2008. In the 2011 MLS Cup final, the Galaxy defeated the Houston Dynamo, 1–0 off a 72nd minute Donovan goal. The goal was scored off a Galaxy counter where Beckham fed a through ball to Donovan who slotted it past Hall. The 2012 final featured both the Galaxy and Dynamo again, making it the first since 2007 that an MLS Cup final was a rematch of the previous final. Again, the Galaxy won the final, this time coming from behind to defeat the Dynamo by a 3–1 scoreline. The match was Beckham&#x27;s final MLS match.

During the 2013 season, the Galaxy&#x27;s chance to three-peat was thwarted by Real Salt Lake. Salt Lake defeated the Galaxy, 2–1 on aggregate, to advance to MLS Cup, where they eventually lost to Sporting Kansas City.

The following season, the Galaxy reached MLS Cup again, playing the New England Revolution, making it a rematch of MLS Cup 2002 and MLS Cup 2005. In extra-time a Robbie Keane goal propelled the Galaxy to their fifth MLS match, a victory in the 2014 MLS Cup.

=== Expansion teams from Cascadia, Canada, and Atlanta ===

The Portland Timbers won the 2015 MLS Cup, defeating the Columbus Crew 2–1. Portland&#x27;s Diego Valeri scored the fastest goal in MLS Cup history at 27 seconds when Crew goalkeeper Steve Clark made a fundamental error after he miscontrolled his defender&#x27;s back-pass while Valeri had advanced towards the ball to strike at the opportunity.

The Seattle Sounders FC faced Toronto FC in the 2016 MLS Cup, which was played at BMO Field in Toronto on the evening of December 10, 2016. The temperature at the start of the match was (, when adjusted for wind chill), with strong winds coming off Lake Ontario. The field was watered shortly before the match, and resultant field was described as icy by players. Seattle Sounders FC defeated Toronto FC 5–4 in a penalty shoot-out after a scoreless match of 90 minutes regular time and 30 minutes overtime. The Sounders did not register a single shot on goal, becoming the first club to do so in an MLS Cup final. The Sounders, despite a very poor start and mid-season managerial change, became the second team from the Pacific Northwest to win the cup, after Portland in 2015.

In the 2017 MLS Cup, Toronto FC and Seattle faced off in a rematch of the previous edition, also at BMO Field. Toronto FC won the match 2–0, and became the first Canadian team to win MLS Cup, and the first MLS team to complete a domestic treble, after winning the Canadian Championship and Supporters&#x27; Shield earlier in the year.
Atlanta United FC, in their second season as an expansion team, won the 2018 edition of MLS Cup by defeating the Portland Timbers 2–0. The match, hosted in Atlanta at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, was attended by 73,019 spectators and broke the MLS Cup attendance record set in 2002 by New England. The club became the second-youngest to win an MLS Cup, behind the 1998 Chicago Fire, and brought the first professional sports championship for the city of Atlanta since 1995.

In the 2019 MLS Cup, Toronto FC and Seattle Sounders FC both overcame underdog status in their respective conferences to contest a third final in four years, this time playing at Seattle&#x27;s home ground. Seattle Sounders FC duly won their second MLS Cup, taking the final match 3–1 at CenturyLink Field in front of a Sounders record attendance of 69,274.

The 2020 edition, which marked the end of a season dramatically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, saw the Sounders return to MLS Cup, this time facing Columbus Crew at the latter&#x27;s home of Mapfre Stadium in Columbus, Ohio. The Crew won 3–0 in front of a crowd restricted to 1,500, in the stadium&#x27;s last playoff game.

== Broadcasting ==

=== United States ===

MLS Cup was aired on English-language networks ABC from 1996 to 2008 and ESPN from 2009 to 2014. ESPN/ABC and Fox alternate as MLS Cup Final broadcasters since 2015, with the MLS Cup 2019 on ABC, their first MLS match since 2008. ABC also air four playoff matches including the MLS Cup 2021. MLS Cup has also been aired on Spanish-language networks TeleFutura in 2007 and 2008, Galavision from 2009 to 2011, TeleFutura/UniMás from 2012 to 2018, and Univision in 2019. ABC previously had Spanish announcers under secondary audio program.

From 2015 to 2022, all MLS Cup playoff games are televised on ESPN, Fox Sports, or Univisión networks. UniMás will air two exclusive playoff matches, while ESPN and its affiliated networks will split the rest of the contests – including MLS Cup – with Fox Sports. Univision, UniMás and TUDN also airs the MLS Cup playoffs in Spanish.

With the new Apple TV deal beginning 2023, FOX Sports will be the only linear broadcaster of MLS, and will carry select MLS Cup playoff matches, and every MLS Cup with no alternate broadcaster starting 2023.

=== Canada ===
MLS Cup coverage in Canada started in 2007, with the addition of Toronto FC to the league. MLS Cup bounced around different networks in the first three seasons of the league&#x27;s presence in Canada; what was then the bold network aired the 2007 Cup Final, with CBC airing the next year&#x27;s Final and GolTV Canada airing the Final the year after that. Since 2010, TSN has aired MLS Cup on its networks; this includes Toronto FC&#x27;s victory in 2017.

In French, RDS has exclusive rights to MLS, and thus MLS Cup.

== Format ==

Over the history of the MLS Cup playoffs, numerous formats have been used.

From 1996 to 1999 and 2003 to 2006, the top four teams per conference qualified for the playoffs.

In 2000 and 2001, the three division winners plus the next five teams with the next best records made the playoffs.

In 2002, the top 8 teams qualified for the playoffs regardless of conference.

In 2007, the top two teams per conference plus the next four teams with the next most points qualified.

At the end of the 2008 season, the top three teams of each conference made the playoffs; in addition, the clubs with the next two highest point totals, regardless of conference, were added to the playoffs. In the first round of this knockout tournament, aggregate goals over two matches determined the winners; the Conference Championships were one match each, with the winner of each conference advancing to MLS Cup. In all rounds, the tie-breaking method was two 15-minute periods of overtime, followed by penalty kicks if necessary. The away goals rule was not used.

At the end of the 2009 and 2010 seasons, the top two teams of each conference made the playoffs; in addition, the clubs with the next four highest point totals, regardless of conference, were added to the playoffs. In the first round of this knockout tournament, aggregate (total) goals over two matches determined the winners; the Conference Championships were one match each, with the winner of each conference advancing to MLS Cup. In all rounds, the tie-breaking method was two 15-minute periods of extra time, followed by penalty kicks if necessary. The away goals rule was not used.

At the 2011 season&#x27;s end, the top three clubs in each of the league&#x27;s two conferences earned the six automatic spots in the Conference Semifinals. The wild card entrants, seeded seventh through tenth, entered based upon their overall position in the overall league standings. The new format was assembled so that the lowest seed to qualify out of the wild card rounds will play against the Supporters&#x27; Shield winner. The highest wild-card seed remaining will play the conference champion that did not win the Shield. The play-in games and Conference Finals were single matches, with the higher-seeded club hosting. The conference semi-finals were a two-leg aggregate series. MLS Cup was held at a predetermined venue.

From 2012 to 2014, the playoff structure was further tweaked with the elimination of the wild card slots. The ten playoff berths were awarded to the top five teams in each conference. In each conference, the No. 4 seeded hosted the No. 5 seed in a single match for a place in the conference semi-finals against the best team in its conference. The Conference Semifinals remained two-legged while the finals changed from a single match to a two-leg aggregate series. Finally, MLS Cup was held at the home field of the finalist with the highest point total during the regular season. The away goals rule was used but did not apply after extra time.

From 2015 to 2018, the top six teams per conference qualified for the playoffs (12 total teams). The first round involved each conference&#x27;s No. 3 seed hosting the No. 6 seed, and the No. 4 hosting No. 5. In the Conference Semifinals, the top seed played the lowest remaining seed, and the No. 2 seed played the next lowest seed.

In the 2019, 2021, and 2022 seasons, the top seven teams per conference qualified for the playoffs, with only the best-ranked team in each conference earning a first-round bye. Each round is still single-elimination. The playoff brackets were fixed, as the league abolished re-seeding. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the top ten teams from the Eastern and top eight teams from the Western conference qualified for the playoffs in the 2020 season, with single-elimination remaining intact. The top six Eastern teams earned byes to the first round while teams seeded 7–10 and competed in play-in games. The lowest-ranked team to advance from the play-in round advanced to play the conference&#x27;s first-placed team while the highest-ranked remaining team from that round advanced to face the conference&#x27;s runner-up. In the Western Conference, the top eight teams competed in their first round with no byes.

The playoffs expanded to nine teams per conference in 2023 with the re-addition of a best-of-three series. The eighth and ninth seeds play a wild card match, with the winner advancing to face the best-ranked team in their conference in Round One while teams ranked 2–7 face each other, with the higher seed hosting. The Conference Semifinals, Conference Final, and MLS Cup final remain single-elimination matches hosted by the team with the better regular season record in late November and early December; as before, without re-seeding.

==Sponsorship==

Since the 2023 edition, the presenting sponsor of MLS Cup has been German automotive company Audi. The company had already been the presenting sponsor of the MLS Cup playoffs and the MLS Golden Boot.

== Champions ==
The winner of Major League Soccer&#x27;s MLS Cup, the final match of the MLS Cup Playoffs, determines that season&#x27;s league champion. The playoff tournament is organized by the league at the conclusion of the regular season in a format similar to other North American professional sports leagues. The tournament is open to the top nine clubs of the Eastern and Western Conferences.

The first MLS Cup final was played on October 20, 1996. To date, the record for the most championships is held by the LA Galaxy with six cup titles. The record for the most championships lost is held by the New England Revolution, who lost the game five times during their history. The championship has been won by the same team in two or more consecutive years on three occasions.

==Records and statistics==

=== MLS Cup titles ===

, 19 of the 32 teams that have played in the league have appeared at an MLS Cup final, and 15 have won a championship. The LA Galaxy has appeared at and won MLS Cup the most times, with six championships in ten appearances. The New England Revolution has appeared five times as a finalist, but has not won an MLS Cup. The Chicago Fire won MLS Cup in their inaugural season in 1998; the only previous professional American soccer team to win a league championship in their inaugural season was the Philadelphia Atoms in the 1973 NASL season.

=== MLS Cup finalists records in CONCACAF competition ===

For most of the league&#x27;s history, only U.S. teams were eligible to fill MLS based qualification slots for CONCACAF competitions. Canadian teams, even MLS Cup participants, had to qualify by winning the separate Canadian Championship; , the only Canadian winner has been 2017 MLS Cup champion Toronto FC, who also won the Canadian Championship that year. However, starting with the 2024 CONCACAF Champions Cup, Canadian clubs could qualify via MLS slots.

Notes


== Trophies ==
Culminating the championship, the winning team is presented with a trophy, known as the Philip F. Anschutz Trophy, named for the contributions and investment to American soccer and MLS by Philip Anschutz. Typically, the award presentation is held on a podium in the center of the field, where the league commissioner will award the team with the cup.

Before the actual award presentation, the finalists are awarded with silver medals with the league&#x27;s logo imprinted on them. The champions are then presented with gold medals, before the trophy is handed to the winning team&#x27;s captain.

In cup history, the MLS Cup champions have been awarded with three different trophies. For the first three MLS Cup finals, the winning team was awarded with the Alan I. Rothenberg Trophy, named for Rothenberg&#x27;s contributions to American soccer. The Rothenberg Trophy was a dark gold trophy that had two handles around a soccer ball, with the league&#x27;s logo imprinted on the plaque. In 1999, the Rothenberg Trophy was redesigned with a soccer ball placed on a beacon. In 2008, the trophy was redesigned again to its present state and renamed the Philip F. Anschutz Trophy.

== Venues ==

In MLS Cup history, eight matches have been played in the Greater Los Angeles area (once at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, six times at Dignity Health Sports Park (formerly StubHub Center and Home Depot Center) in Carson, California, and once at Banc of California Stadium). Columbus, Ohio is alone in second place having hosted MLS Cup final 4 times (3 held at the Historic Crew Stadium and one at Lower.com Field). Three markets are tied for having hosted MLS Cup the third-most number of times, with three matches each: the Greater Boston metro area (twice contested at Foxboro Stadium and once at Gillette Stadium, both in Foxborough, Massachusetts), Washington, D.C. (all played at RFK Stadium), and Toronto (all held at BMO Field).

Through the 2011 season every MLS Cup had been played at a predetermined site (i.e., announced before the playoff participants were known). On the day before the 2011 Cup, MLS announced that starting in 2012, Cup finals would be hosted by the participant with the highest point total during the regular season. As is the case with awarding the Supporters&#x27; Shield, if the two finalists are tied on points, the team with the most wins hosts the final. For example, at MLS Cup 2022, Los Angeles FC and the Philadelphia Union both finished with 67 points, but LAFC had two more wins and thus hosted the final.

Before the 2012 Cup and the change to awarding the final to the participant with the higher point total, only three teams played the match on their home field. In the 1997 MLS Cup final, D.C. United won the match in their home stadium over Colorado Rapids, RFK Stadium. The same occurrence applied in the 2002 MLS Cup final, where the LA Galaxy defeated the New England Revolution 1–0, in the Revolution&#x27;s home stadium Gillette Stadium. As a result, the 1997 and 2002 MLS Cup finals drew the largest crowds in MLS Cup history prior to the 2012 change to the higher point total hosting.
In 2011, the LA Galaxy won their 2011 MLS Cup match in their home stadium (Home Depot Center), 1–0, over the Houston Dynamo. The Galaxy became the second team (and first since D.C. United in 1997) to win the Cup at home.

After MLS adopted its current criteria for awarding the MLS Cup match, the first three Cup finals were won by the hosts. The 2012 MLS Cup saw a rematch of the 2011 Cup at the same site, with the Galaxy successfully defending the title with a 3–1 win. In 2013, Sporting Kansas City became the third team to win the cup in their home stadium (Sporting Park) when they beat Real Salt Lake in the penalty kicks, which was the longest shootout in MLS Cup history. Then, in 2014, the Galaxy defeated the New England Revolution 2–1 at the renamed StubHub Center in a match that was also notable as the final competitive match for U.S. national team all-time leading goal scorer Landon Donovan. The pattern was broken in 2015, however, when the Portland Timbers defeated the Columbus Crew in the Crew&#x27;s home stadium.

Through the 2011 season, MLS typically announced the championship location either prior to the start of its respective season, or even a few weeks into the campaign. For the 2011 championship, the league selected Home Depot Center in Carson, California, making it a fourth time the league&#x27;s championship had been hosted at the venue.

To date, the coldest MLS Cup final was the 2013 championship game played in Kansas City, Kansas at Sporting Kansas City&#x27;s Sporting Park where the temperature was . The hottest MLS Cup final was the 2005 championship game played in Frisco, Texas at FC Dallas&#x27;s Pizza Hut Park where the temperature was 75 °F (23 °C).

The 2010 edition of MLS Cup was the first final in league history to be played outside of the United States. The match was played in Canada at Toronto&#x27;s BMO Field, the home ground of MLS club Toronto FC.

=== Stadiums ===
&quot;Italics&quot; indicate a stadium that is now inactive.

== Most Valuable Player ==
Following each championship, a player on the winning club is awarded with the title of being the Most Valuable Player (MVP). Usually, but not necessarily, the winner of the award is the player who scores the game-winning goal, or sets up the game-winning goal. This is the case of the 2007, 2008, 2010, 2017, 2019 and 2020 recipients, who all scored game-winning goals, or assisted multiple goals for the winning side.

Exceptions to this occurred in 2000, 2009, 2016, and 2021 where the Most Valuable Player award went to goalkeepers Tony Meola, Nick Rimando, Stefan Frei, and Sean Johnson, respectively. Meola and Frei, with the Kansas City Wizards and Seattle Sounders FC, both earned shutouts for their respective teams in the cup. Rimando and Johnson made two saves in a penalty shoot-out to give Real Salt Lake the title over the LA Galaxy and New York City FC the title over Portland Timbers, respectively.

=== List of MVP award recipients ===

== Players with multiple MLS Cup titles ==
At least 40 players have won two MLS Cups, mostly for teams with sequential or near-sequential titles (D.C. 1996–1999, San Jose 2001 and 2003, LA Galaxy 2002 and 2005, and 2011–2012, and Houston 2006–2007). Brian Mullan is the only player to have won the Cup with four different teams, while players that have won it with three different teams include: Craig Waibel, Alejandro Moreno, Ezra Hendrickson, and Darlington Nagbe.

<text>A bleep censor is the replacement of profanity and classified information with a beep sound (usually a ), used in public television, radio and social media.

==History==

Bleeping has been used for many years as a means of censoring TV and radio programs to remove content not deemed suitable for &quot;family&quot;, &quot;daytime&quot;, &quot;broadcasting&quot;, or &quot;international&quot; viewing, as well as sensitive classified information for security. The bleep censor is a software module, manually operated by a broadcast technician. A bleep is sometimes accompanied by a digital blur pixelization or box over the speaker&#x27;s mouth in cases where the removed speech may still be easily understood by lip reading.

In subtitles, bleeped words are usually represented by &quot;[bleep]&quot;. Sometimes the phrases &quot;[expletive]&quot;, &quot;[beep]&quot;, &quot;[censored]&quot;, and &quot;[explicit]&quot; are used, while it is also common (though less so) to see hyphens (e.g. abbreviations of the word &quot;fuck&quot; like &quot;f—k&quot; &quot;f---&quot;), a series of X&#x27;s, or asterisks and other non-letter symbols (e.g. ****, f***, f**k, f*ck, f#@k or f#@%), remaining faithful to the audio track. The characters used to denote censorship in text are called grawlixes. Where open captions are used (generally in instances where the speaker is not easily understood) a blank is used where the word is bleeped. Occasionally, bleeping is not reflected in the captions, allowing the unedited dialogue to be seen. Sometimes, a &quot;black bar&quot; can be seen for a closed caption bleep.

Bleeping is mostly used in unscripted programs such as documentaries, radio features, and panel games, since scripted productions are designed to suit the time of their broadcast. For example, on the Discovery Channel, bleeping is extremely common. In the case of scripted comedies, most bleeping may be used for humorous purposes, and other sound effects may be substituted for the bleep tone for comical effect; examples of this include a slide whistle, a baby cooing, dolphin noises, or the &quot;boing&quot; of a spring. Some scripted comedies purposely incorporate bleeping for comedic purposes; for example, profanity in the American sitcom &quot;Reno 911!&quot; is always bleeped as the show is presented in a mockumentary style, while a recurring joke used in sketches by Australian comedy group Aunty Donna features the bleep appearing slightly too late, resulting in the original profanity being clearly heard before it is immediately followed by a bleep that either serves no purpose or interrupts what the speaker was saying after they had already used profanity.

Other uses of bleeping may include reality television, infomercials, game shows, and daytime/late night talk shows, where the bleep conceals personally identifying information such as ages, surnames, addresses/hometowns, phone numbers, and attempts to advertise a personal business without advanced or appropriate notice, in order to maintain the subject&#x27;s privacy (as seen for subjects arrested in episodes of &quot;Traffic Cops&quot; or &quot;COPS&quot;).

When films are edited for daytime/nighttime TV, broadcasters may prefer not to bleep swearing, but cut out the segment containing it, replace the speech with different words, or cover it with silence or a sound effect.

Bleeping is commonly used in English-language and Japanese-language broadcasting, but is sometimes and rarely used in some other languages (such as Arabic, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Icelandic, Filipino, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Korean, Norwegian, Hebrew, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, Polish, Russian, Thai and Turkish), displaying the varying attitudes between countries; some are more liberal towards swearing, less inclined to use strong profanities in front of a camera in the first place, or unwilling to censor. In the Philippines and Ecuador, undubbed movies on television have profanity muted instead of bleeped.

On live TV airings, live TV broadcastings prefer to mute the sound to censor profanity rather than bleep over it. This was already the case on March 27, 2022, when American television broadcasters muted the sound during a live broadcast of the Oscars after Will Smith slapped Chris Rock and shouted, &quot;Keep my wife&#x27;s name out your fucking mouth!&quot;, to which Rock responded, &quot;Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me!&quot;. Nevertheless, the complete verbal exchange between Smith and Rock was broadcast uncensored in other countries like Japan, Australia, and Argentina.

Bleeping frequently occurs in videos on the Internet. YouTube videos often have profanity bleeped or muted out as YouTube policy specifies that videos including profanities may be &quot;demonetized&quot; or stripped of ads. Beginning in 2019, the bleep censor began to be more often used for censoring out words related to sensitive and contentious topics to evade algorithmic censorship online, especially on Meta and TikTok platforms.

==Regulations==

=== Advertising in the United Kingdom ===
Under the Ofcom guidelines, television and radio commercials are not allowed to use bleeps to obscure swearing under BACC/CAP guidelines. However, this does not apply to program trailers or cinema advertisements and &quot;fuck&quot; is bleeped out of two cinema advertisements for Johnny Vaughan&#x27;s Capital FM show and the cinema advertisement for the &quot;Family Guy&quot; season 5 DVD. An advert for esure insurance released in October 2007 uses the censor bleep, as well as a black star placed over the speaker&#x27;s mouth, to conceal the name of a competitor company the speaker said she used to use. The Comedy Central advert for &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot; had a version of &quot;Kyle&#x27;s Mom&#x27;s a Bitch&quot; where vulgarities were bleeped out, though the movie itself did not have censorship, and was given a 15 rating, despite a high amount of foul language.

A Barnardo&#x27;s ad, released in summer 2007, has two versions: one where a boy can be heard saying &quot;fuck off&quot; four times which is restricted to &quot;18&quot; rated cinema screenings, and one where a censor bleep sound obscures the profanity which is still restricted to &quot;15&quot; and &quot;18&quot; rated films. Neither is permitted on UK television.

Trailers for programs containing swearing are usually bleeped until well after the watershed, and it is very rare for any trailer to use the most severe swear words uncensored.

=== United States ===

In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission has the rights to regulate indecent broadcasts. However, the FCC does not actively monitor television broadcasts for indecency violations, nor does it keep a record of television broadcasts. Reports must be documented exclusively by the public and submitted in written form, whether by traditional letter or e-mail.

The FCC is allowed to enforce indecency laws during 6 a.m. – 10 p.m. local time. In addition, for network broadcasts, offensive material seen during watershed in one time zone may be subject to fines and prosecution for stations in earlier time zones: for instance, a program with offensive content broadcast at 10 p.m. Eastern Time/Mountain resulted in many stations being fined because of this detail. It falls out of watershed at 9 p.m. Central Time/Pacific Time. To compensate, a channel may only air uncensored material after 1 a.m. Eastern Time so that the broadcast is in watershed in the contiguous United States. For example, Comedy Central only airs uncensored after 1 a.m. so that Eastern Time, Central Time, Mountain Time, and Pacific Time all have it past 10 p.m.

Cable and satellite channels are subject to regulations on what the FCC considers &quot;obscenity&quot;, but are exempt from the FCC&#x27;s &quot;indecency&quot; and &quot;profanity&quot; regulations, though many police themselves, mainly to appeal to advertisers who would be averse to placing their ads on their programs.

Some television and cinematic productions work around the requirement of a censor bleep by writing dialogue in a language that the intended audience is unlikely to understand (for example, Joss Whedon&#x27;s &quot;Firefly&quot; used untranslated Chinese curses to avoid being &quot;bleeped&quot;, while the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episodes &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; and &quot;Elementary, Dear Data&quot; have the character of Captain Jean-Luc Picard utter the French obscenity, &quot;merde&quot;, which is equivalent to &quot;shit&quot; in English.).

The &quot;Arthur&quot; episode &quot;Bleep&quot; censored out a bad word that D.W. says in the story in order to have an episode about swearing without needing to expose child viewers to the word.

<text>Schering-Plough Corporation was an American pharmaceutical company. It was originally the U.S. subsidiary of the German company Schering AG, which was founded in 1851 by Ernst Christian Friedrich Schering. As a result of nationalization, it became an independent company. In 1971, the Schering Corporation merged with Plough, Inc. (founded by Memphis-based entrepreneur Abe Plough in 1908) to form Schering-Plough. On November 4, 2009 Merck &amp; Co. merged with Schering-Plough with the new company taking the name of Merck &amp; Co.

Schering-Plough manufactured several pharmaceutical drugs, the most well-known of which were the allergy drugs Claritin and Clarinex, an anti-cholesterol drug Vytorin, and a brain tumor drug Temodar. These are now available from Merck &amp; Co.

Schering-Plough also owned and operated the major foot care brand name Dr. Scholl&#x27;s and the skin care line Coppertone. These also became a part of the new company.

, Schering-Plough had 1.4% market share in the U.S., placing it seventeenth in the top twenty pharmaceutical corporations by sales compiled by IMS Health.

Schering-Plough was a full member of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), a membership which is also maintained by the new Merck &amp; Co.

==History==
===Pharmaceuticals and consumer products===
Schering was founded in 1851 by Ernst Christian Friedrich Schering as Schering AG in Germany.

Plough, Incorporated was founded by the Memphis, Tennessee area entrepreneur Abe Plough (1892–1984) in 1908. He borrowed $125 from his father to start the business at age sixteen. As a one-man business, he mixed &quot;Plough&#x27;s Antiseptic Healing Oil,&quot; a &quot;sure cure for any ill of man or beast,&quot; and sold it off a horse-drawn buggy.

Plough&#x27;s acquisitions included St Joseph&#x27;s Aspirin for children, Maybelline cosmetics, and Coppertone skin care products. Plough also had a broadcasting division, operating radio stations in Atlanta, Georgia (WPLO-AM &amp; FM); Baltimore, Maryland (WCAO-AM &amp; FM); Boston, Massachusetts (WCOP-AM &amp; FM); Chicago, Illinois (WJJD-AM &amp; FM); and Memphis, Tennessee (WMPS-AM &amp; FM).

Following the entry of the United States into World War II in 1941, U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt ordered Schering AG&#x27;s U.S. assets be seized. These became the Schering Corporation. The company was placed under a government administratorship until 1952, when it was released, and its assets sold to the private sector.

In 1957, Schering acquired White Laboratories.

In 1971, the Schering Corporation merged with Plough, Inc. At the time of the merger, Abe Plough became Chairman of the combined company.
In 2000, Schering-Plough bought a new campus in Summit, New Jersey from Novartis.

On March 12, 2007, Schering-Plough Corp. purchased Organon BioSciences, the drug unit of Netherlands-based Akzo Nobel, for $14.4 billion, giving the US pharmaceutical company an array of women&#x27;s health products and numerous late-stage pipelines of experimental medicines. &quot;Organon&quot; itself was founded in 1923 by Dr. Saal van Zwanenberg, the president of Zwanenberg&#x27;s Slachterijen en Fabrieken.

On November 4, 2009 Schering-Plough merged with Merck &amp; Co. and through a reverse merger, Merck became a subsidiary of Schering-Plough, which renamed itself Merck.

===Animal health===
====Coopers Animal Health====
One of Schering-Plough&#x27;s plants, in Upper Hutt, New Zealand was the largest single site for the production of veterinary vaccines in the world. This was primarily because New Zealand&#x27;s isolation has formed a natural quarantine, leaving the country free of rabies, foot and mouth, scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and many other livestock diseases. It formerly had echinococcosis, but this has been eradicated. The site was known locally as Coopers Animal Health, a trademark which originated in the 1850s with a British company, Cooper &amp; Nephews; the Coopers brand name was still in use by Schering-Plough in Australia, but not elsewhere.

====Intervet====
As a result of the acquisition of Organon BioSciences, Schering-Plough bolstered its animal health business with the Akzo Nobel subsidiary Intervet, obtained control of the active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturer, Diosynth and gained access to human vaccine production through the subsidiary Nobilon. The three companies comprising Organon BioSciences were Organon, Diosynth, and Intervet. HomeAgain continues to use the Intervet name owned by Merck.

====Merck Animal Health, MSD Animal Health====
After the merger of Schering-Plough with Merck the animal health division was still known as Intervet/Schering-Plough Animal Health. A merger of Merial and Intervet/Schering-Plough was planned in 2010 but was abandoned in March 2011. On June 29, 2011, the company announced that the animal health division would now be known as Merck Animal Health in the United States and Canada; it is now called MSD Animal Health elsewhere in the world.

<doc id="483260" wikidata="Q2029282" url="?curid=483260" title="Religious discrimination">
<text>Religious discrimination is treating a person or group differently because of the particular religion they align with or were born into. This includes instances when adherents of different religions, denominations or non-religions are treated unequally due to their particular beliefs, either by the law or in institutional settings, such as employment or housing.

Religious discrimination or bias is related to religious persecution, the most extreme forms of which would include instances in which people have been executed for beliefs that have been perceived to be heretical. Laws that only carry light punishments are described as &quot;mild forms of religious persecution&quot; or &quot;religious discrimination&quot;. In recent years, terms such as religism and religionism have also been used, but &quot;religious discrimination&quot; remains the more widely used term.

Even in societies where freedom of religion is a constitutional right, adherents of minority religions sometimes voice their concerns about religious discrimination against them. Insofar as legal policies are concerned, cases that are perceived to be cases of religious discrimination might be the result of interference in the religious sphere by other spheres of the public that are regulated by law.

==History==

===Ancient===

Jews also faced religious discrimination in the Roman Empire. The low point was the expulsion of Jews from Jerusalem and subsequent paganization of the city during the reign of Emperor Hadrian (117–138 AD), which led to the Jewish diaspora.

Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire was widespread. Christianity threatened the polytheistic order of the Roman Empire because of the importance of evangelism in Christianity. Under the Neronian persecution, Rome began to discriminate against monotheists who refused to worship the Roman gods. Nero blamed Christians for the Great Fire of Rome (64 AD). During the Decian persecution, Valerianic persecution, and Diocletianic Persecution, Christians were slaughtered by being thrown to wild beasts, churches were destroyed, priests were imprisoned, and scriptures were confiscated. 

Religious discrimination against Christians ended with the Edict of Milan (313 AD), and the Edict of Thessalonica (380 AD) made Christianity the official religion of the empire. By the 5th century Christianity became the dominant religion in Europe and took a reversed role, discriminating against pagans, heretics, and Jews.

===Medieval===
In the Middle Ages, antisemitism in Europe was widespread. Christians falsely accused Jews of Jewish deicide, blood libel, and well poisoning, and subjected them to expulsions, forced conversions, and mandatory sermons. In the Papal States, Jews were required to live in poor segregated neighbourhoods called ghettos. Historians note that religious discrimination against Jews tended to increase during negative economic and climatic shocks in Europe, such as when they were scapegoated for causing the Black Death.

During the Islamic Golden Age, many Jewish, Christian, Zoroastrian, and Pagan lands came under Muslim rule. As People of the Book, Jews, Christians, and Mandaeans living under Muslim rule became dhimmis with social status inferior to that of Muslims. Although Sharia law granted dhimmis freedom of religion, they were subjected to religious discrimination as second-class citizens and had to pay a jizya tax. They could not proselytize Muslims, marry Muslims (in the case of dhimmi men), build or repair churches and synagogues without permission, perform loud religious rituals such as the ringing of church bells, carry weapons, or ride horses and camels. These discriminatory laws forced many Christians into poverty and slavery.

During the First Crusade (1096), Christian knights recaptured the Holy Land from Muslim rule, massacring most of the Muslims and Jews in Jerusalem. This led to the creation of Catholic-ruled Crusader states, most notably the Kingdom of Jerusalem. In these kingdoms Jews, Muslims, and Orthodox Christians had no rights, being considered property of the crusader lords.

===Modern===
In early modern Europe, there was a religious conflict between Catholics and Protestants taking place in many countries. In early modern Britain, the Act of Uniformity 1548 compelled the Church of England to use only the Book of Common Prayer for its liturgy. There were several other Acts of Uniformity as the conflict continued well into the 19th century. When Catholicism became the sole compulsory religion in early modern France during the reign of Louis XIV, the Huguenots had to leave the country en masse.

During the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the late modern period, particularly ever since the Great Turkish War (1683), discrimination against religious minorities worsened. The destruction of churches and the expulsion of local Christian communities became commonplace. Tolerance policies were abandoned in Ottoman Albania, in favor of reducing the size of Albania&#x27;s Catholic population through Islamization.

Antisemitism in the Russian Empire was widespread, as Imperial Russia contained the world&#x27;s largest Jewish population at the time. Jews were subject to discriminatory laws such as the May Laws (1882), which restricted them from certain locations, jobs, transactions, schools, and political positions. They were also targeted in frequent anti-Jewish riots, called pogroms.

==In Asia==

=== Pakistan ===

Religious discrimination in Pakistan is a serious issue. Several incidents of discrimination have been recorded with some finding support by the state itself. In a case of constitutionally sanctioned religious discrimination, non-Muslims in Pakistan cannot become prime minister or president, even if they are Pakistani citizens. Pakistan&#x27;s Blasphemy Law, according to critics, &quot;is overwhelmingly being used to persecute religious minorities and settle personal vendettas&quot;. Ahmadiyya Muslims have been subject to significant persecution and are sometimes declared &#x27;non-Muslims&#x27;.

=== China ===
Uyghurs or Uighurs are an ethnic and religious minority group in China. Their identity is based on the Islamic religion and has roots in the former East Turkistan culture. They reside in Xinjiang, an autonomous region situated in the west of the country. This group is persecuted by the Chinese government due to its perceived threat to the nation&#x27;s security and identity. The Chinese government believes that the Uyghurs have separatist, extremist, and terrorist thoughts. It has detained around one million Uyghurs in camps. According to the Chinese government, these camps are created to re-educate the minority Muslims by learning about the negative consequences of extremism. Detainees are punished in these camps. The treatment of the Uyghurs violates their human rights because they are forcibly sent to the camps for an indefinite period of time. The discrimination against the Uyghurs comes in many forms. Some apparent restrictions include banning religious veils or robes in public. The training camps serve to inculcate beliefs that are congruent with the beliefs of the Chinese Communist Party. 
Subjected to abuse and suppression in China, some Uyghurs who were seeking refuge resettled in different parts of the world. In June 2021, it was reported that the Uyghurs were being detained even outside China. Following the diplomatic relations of China with the UAE, Uyghurs living in Dubai were subjected to arrest, prolonged detention and deportation to China. China allegedly requested for the deportation of Uyghurs from three Arab countries, including the UAE. The global influence of Beijing has even resulted in the expansion of religious discrimination against the Uyghur Muslims who are residing abroad.

=== India ===
Although the Constitution of India prohibits discrimination based on religion discrimination and religious violence in India are frequent, sometimes even involving the function of government. For example dalit people who are not Hindu, Sikh, or Buddhist are not covered by the &quot;Scheduled Castes&quot; laws and hence dalit Christians and Muslims do not receive the affirmative action political representation and educational placement, welfare benefits, and hate crimes protections accorded to their fellows. Dalits worshipping the same gods as Hindus were previously considered to be of a different religion and in the early twentieth century the question &quot;Is he a Hindu or Pariah?&quot; had currency.

==In the Middle East==

===Algeria===
Apostasy and proselytization is punishable by Algerian law. Prison sentences for those that practice Christianity do occur.

===Egypt===
Apostasy and proselytization

Violence against the Christian minority is common. 

Coptic Christians face many barriers to building and renovating Coptic churches.

===Iraq===
Christian Assyrians in Iraq have suffered from discrimination since Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Arabization policies in the 1980s.

===Morocco===
Apostasy and proselytization is punishable by Moroccan law. Prison sentences for those that leave Islam do occur.

=== Iran ===
Throughout the contemporary history of Iran, ethnic and religious minorities have experienced religious discrimination. Since most of the people of Iran follow the Shia religion, most of the official and unofficial laws of this country are influenced by the Shia religion. 

Before the 1979 revolution, there were laws in Iran that allowed religious minorities to participate in elections, have representatives in the parliament, and even reach the highest government positions. After the revolution of 1979, the laws regarding religious minorities were changed. In the current constitution of Iran, only followers of Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrianism and Sunnis are allowed to perform their religious ceremonies in private and they do not have the right to propagate and spread their religion in public places (proselytize). 

Also, Iran&#x27;s constitution does not recognize other religious minorities such as Baha&#x27;is, Buddhists, Hindus, and Atheists. Adherents of these belief systems are not allowed to express their beliefs, but they are deprived of their various rights, including working in government and non-government jobs, etc.

According to the current apostasy laws of Iran, no Muslim has the right to change his (or her) religion, and if he changes his religion, they can be punished by prison and execution. After the Islamic Revolution in 1979 until 2023, all important political and security posts and positions in the country have been assigned to the followers of the Shia religion.

Javid Rahman, the UN rapporteur on Iran affairs, criticized the violation of human rights in Iran at the 77th session of the UN General Assembly. He accused the Iranian government of always ignoring the rights of ethnic and religious minorities in the country and involving them in various judicial cases. In this report, he demanded the release of dissident prisoners and the recognition of the rights of religious and political minorities in Iran.

Kameel Ahmady, an anthropologist and developer of the book From Border to Border (a book about the situation of ethnic and religious minorities in Iran) and his colleagues believes that the legal discriminations in the country&#x27;s laws regarding ethnic and religious minorities must be removed.

In economic terms, Sunni rural areas lack important infrastructure. It is believed that the majority of the country’s facilities are concentrated in the central provinces. In terms of culture, some ethnic and religious minorities believe that they face restrictions on holding regional festivals and conferences. The national and local media do not cover and represent the cultures and traditions of these regions as the people believe they deserve, and do not provide media services related to the local and regional cultures of Different religions groups. Most Baluchis, as well as some Kurds, have different religious orientations than the state’s official religion. These groups feel that the religious beliefs of government officials lead to the political, cultural, social and economic oppression of indigenous peoples.

==In Western countries==

===United States===

Religious discrimination in the history of the United States dates back to the first Protestant Christian European settlers, composed mostly of English Puritans, during the British colonization of North America (16th century), directed both towards Native Americans and non-Protestant Roman Catholic European settlers. (&quot;See also&quot; Colonial history of the United States).

In a 1979 consultation on the issue, the United States Commission on Civil Rights defined religious discrimination in relation to the civil rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Whereas religious civil liberties, such as the right to hold or not to hold a religious belief, are essential for Freedom of Religion (in the United States secured by the First Amendment), religious discrimination occurs when someone is denied &quot;the equal protection of the laws, equality of status under the law, equal treatment in the administration of justice, and equality of opportunity and access to employment, education, housing, public services and facilities, and public accommodation because they exercise their right to religious freedom&quot;.

===Canada===
In Canada, during 1995-1998, Newfoundland had only Christian schools (four of them, Pentecostal, Roman Catholic, Seventh-day Adventist, and inter-denominational (Anglican, Salvation Army and United Church)). The right to organize publicly supported religious schools was only given to certain Christian denominations, thus tax money was used to support a selected group of Christian denominations. The denominational schools could also refuse the admission of a student or the hiring of a qualified teacher on purely religious grounds. Quebec has used two school systems, one Protestant and the other Roman Catholic, but it seems this system will be replaced with two secular school systems: one French and the other English.

Ontario had two school systems going back before Confederation. The British North America Act (1867) gave the Provinces jurisdiction over education. Section 93 of the BNA Act offered constitutional protection for denominational schools as they existed in law at the time of Confederation. Like &quot;Public schools&quot;, Catholic schools are fully funded from kindergarten to grade 12. However, profound demographic changes of the past few decades have made the province of Ontario a multicultural, multi-racial, and multi-religious society. The thought that one religious group is privileged to have schools funded from the public purse is often considered unacceptable in a pluralistic, multicultural, secular society. Although it&#x27;s also true that the people who send their children to those schools have a form that directs their tax dollars to that school system.

Canadian faith-based university Trinity Western University (TWU) is currently facing a challenge from members of the legal and LGBT community to its freedom to educate students in a private university context while holding certain &quot;religious values&quot;, such as the freedom to discriminate against other people, including requiring students to sign a chastity oath, and denying LGBT students the same rights as straight students. TWU faced a similar battle in 2001 (&quot;Trinity Western University v. British Columbia College of Teachers&quot;) where the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that TWU was capable to teach professional disciplines.

On June 16, 2019, Quebec banned public servants in positions of authority from wearing visible religious symbols. The legislation was erected with the goal of promoting neutrality. Prime Minister Trudeau argues that the ban goes against the fundamental rights of the Canadian people.

===European Union===
The Court of Justice of the European Union applies aspects of formal equality and substantive equality when evaluating religious discrimination.

====Germany====

Scientologists in Germany face specific political and economic restrictions. They are barred from membership in some major political parties, and businesses and other employers use so-called &quot;sect filters&quot; to expose a prospective business partner&#x27;s or employee&#x27;s association with the organization. German federal and state interior ministers started a process aimed at banning Scientology in late 2007, but abandoned the initiative a year later, finding insufficient legal grounds. Despite this, polls suggest that most Germans favor banning Scientology altogether. The U.S. government has repeatedly raised concerns over discriminatory practices directed at individual Scientologists.

====Greece====
In Greece since the independence from the Muslim Ottomans rule in the 19th century, the Greek Orthodox Church has been given privileged status and only the Greek Orthodox church, Roman Catholic, some Protestant churches, Judaism and Islam are recognized religions. The Muslim minority alleges that Greece persistently and systematically discriminates against Muslims.

Recently, professor Nick Drydakis (Anglia Ruskin University) examined religious affiliation and employment bias in Athens, by implementing an experimental field study. Labor market outcomes (occupation access, entry wage, and wait time for call back) were assessed for three religious minorities (Pentecostal, evangelical, and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses). Results indicate that religious minorities experience employment bias. Moreover, religious minorities face greater constraints on occupational access in more prestigious jobs compared to less prestigious jobs. Occupational access and entry wage bias is highest for religious minority women. In all cases, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses face the greatest bias; female employers offered significantly lower entry wages to Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses than male employers.

===Mexico===
According to a &quot;Human Rights Practices&quot; report by the &quot;U.S. State department&quot; on Mexico note that &quot;some local officials infringe on religious freedom, especially in the south&quot;. There is a conflict between Catholic/Mayan syncretists and Protestant evangelicals in the Chiapas region.

===United Kingdom===
Within the United Kingdom (UK), Northern Ireland has a long history of discrimination based on the religious and political affiliations of Roman Catholics (Nationalists) and Protestants (Loyalists). Some discrimination against Catholics was based on the idea that they were disloyal to the State. In a speech on 19 March 1935, a member of the Northern Ireland government Basil Brooke spoke on the issue of employment based on religion: &quot;I recommend those people who are loyalists not employ Roman Catholics, ninety-nine percent of whom are disloyal.&quot; In November of 1934 the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland James Craig stated that his administration was a &quot;Protestant Government for a Protestant People.&quot; Discrimination based on religion in Northern Ireland is alleged to have occurred in the areas of housing allocation, employment, voting rights, state benefits and with the Gerrymandering (or discriminatory Electoral boundary delimitation to ensure election results.

An analysis of the 1,095 Northern Ireland government appointments in 1951 showed that Nationalists (comprising 34 percent of the population) received only 11.8 percent of positions in local government bodies: Borough, County, Urban and Rural District Councils. A system known as Plural voting provided for property owners to cast multiple votes in elections. Plural voting ended in the UK in 1948 but remained in effect in Northern Ireland until 1969. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) was founded in 1967. Several of the demands made by NICRA were for &quot;One Man One Vote&quot;, the end of gerrymandering and discrimination based on religion.

<doc id="483263" wikidata="Q1256823" url="?curid=483263" title="Three-fifths Compromise">
<text>The Three-fifths Compromise was an agreement reached during the 1787 United States Constitutional Convention over the inclusion of slaves in a state&#x27;s total population. This count would determine: the number of seats in the House of Representatives; the number of electoral votes each state would be allocated; and how much money the states would pay in taxes. Slave holding states wanted their entire population to be counted to determine the number of Representatives those states could elect and send to Congress. Free states wanted to exclude the counting of slave populations in slave states, since those slaves had no voting rights. A compromise was struck to resolve this impasse. The compromise counted three-fifths of each state&#x27;s slave population toward that state&#x27;s total population for the purpose of apportioning the House of Representatives, effectively giving the Southern states more power in the House relative to the Northern states. It also gave slaveholders similarly enlarged powers in Southern legislatures; this was an issue in the secession of West Virginia from Virginia in 1863. Free black people and indentured servants were not subject to the compromise, and each was counted as one full person for representation.

In the United States Constitution, the Three-fifths Compromise is part of Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3.
Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) later superseded this clause and explicitly repealed the compromise.

==Text==
In the U.S. Constitution, the Three-fifths Compromise is part of Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3:
==Drafting and ratification in the Constitution==
===Confederation Congress===
The three-fifths ratio originated with an amendment proposed to the Articles of Confederation on April 18, 1783. The amendment was to have changed the basis for determining the wealth of each state, and hence its tax obligations, from real estate to population, as a measure of ability to produce wealth. The proposal by a committee of the Congress had suggested that taxes &quot;shall be supplied by the several colonies in proportion to the number of inhabitants of every age, sex, and quality, except Indians not paying taxes&quot;. The South immediately objected to this formula since it would include slaves, who were viewed primarily as property, in calculating the amount of taxes to be paid. As Thomas Jefferson wrote in his notes on the debates, the Southern states would be taxed &quot;according to their numbers and their wealth conjunctly, while the northern would be taxed on numbers only&quot;.

After proposed compromises of one-half by Benjamin Harrison of Virginia and three-fourths by several New Englanders failed to gain sufficient support, Congress finally settled on the three-fifths ratio proposed by James Madison. But this amendment ultimately failed, falling two states short of the unanimous approval required to amend the Articles of Confederation (New Hampshire and New York opposed it).

===Federalist Papers 54–55===
Madison explained the reasoning for the 3/5 in Federalist No. 54 &quot;The Apportionment of Members Among the States&quot; (February 12, 1788) as:

&quot;We subscribe to the doctrine,&quot; might one of our Southern brethren observe, &quot;that representation relates more immediately to persons, and taxation more immediately to property, and we join in the application of this distinction to the case of our slaves. But we must deny the fact, that slaves are considered merely as property, and in no respect whatever as persons. The true state of the case is, that they partake of both these qualities: being considered by our laws, in some respects, as persons, and in other respects as property...Let the case of the slaves be considered, as it is in truth, a peculiar one. Let the compromising expedient of the Constitution be mutually adopted, which regards them as inhabitants, but as debased by servitude below the equal level of free inhabitants, which regards the SLAVE as divested of two fifths of the MAN...The federal Constitution, therefore, decides with great propriety on the case of our slaves, when it views them in the mixed character of persons and of property. This is in fact their true character. It is the character bestowed on them by the laws under which they live; and it will not be denied, that these are the proper criterion; because it is only under the pretext that the laws have transformed the negroes into subjects of property, that a place is disputed them in the computation of numbers; and it is admitted, that if the laws were to restore the rights which have been taken away, the negroes could no longer be refused an equal share of representation with the other inhabitants.

Madison later expanded further in Federalist No. 55 &quot;The Total Number of the House of Representatives&quot; (February 15, 1788) as explaining that the 3/5 had to do with estimating the population size of slaves at the time as well:

Within three years a census is to be taken, when the number may be augmented to one for every thirty thousand inhabitants; and within every successive period of ten years the census is to be renewed, and augmentations may continue to be made under the above limitation. It will not be thought an extravagant conjecture that the first census will, at the rate of one for every thirty thousand, raise the number of representatives to at least one hundred. Estimating the negroes in the proportion of three fifths, it can scarcely be doubted that the population of the United States will by that time, if it does not already, amount to three millions.

===Constitutional Convention===
During the Constitutional Convention, the compromise was proposed by delegate James Wilson and seconded by Charles Pinckney.

When he presented his plan for the frame of government to the Convention on its first day, Charles Pinckney of South Carolina proposed that for the purposes of apportionment, a &quot;House of Delegates&quot; be determined through the apportionment of &quot;one Member for every thousand Inhabitants 3/5 of Blacks included.&quot; The Convention unanimously accepted the principle that representation in the House of Representatives would be in proportion to the relative state populations, but it initially rejected his proposal regarding apportionment of the black population along with the rest of his plan. Delegates opposed to slavery proposed that only free inhabitants of each state be counted for apportionment purposes, while delegates supportive of slavery opposed the proposal, wanting slaves to count in their actual numbers.

The proposal to count slaves by a three-fifths ratio was first presented on June 11, and agreed to by nine states to two with only a brief debate. It was debated at length between July 9 and 13 (inclusive) when it was initially voted down by the members present at the Convention six to four. A few Southern delegates, seeing an opportunity, then proposed full representation for their slave population; most states voted no. Seeing that the states could not remain united about counting the slaves as five-fifths without some sort of compromise measure, the ratio of three-fifths was brought back to the table and agreed to by eight states to two.

===Debate===

Gouverneur Morris from New York doubted that a direct tax, whose burden on Southern states would be increased by the Three-fifths Compromise, could be effectively leveled on the vast United States. The primary ways of generating federal revenue, he said, would be excise taxes and import duties, which would tax the North more than the South; therefore, the taxation provision was irrelevant, and the compromise would only increase the number of pro-slavery legislators.

Northern delegates argued only voters should be accounted for. Southern delegates countered, claiming slaves counted just as much as voters, despite Northerners questioning why slaves should be held by Southerners.

===Compromise and enactment===
After a contentious debate, the compromise that was finally agreed upon—of counting &quot;all other persons&quot; as only three-fifths of their actual numbers—reduced the representation of the slave states relative to the original proposals, but improved it over the Northern position. An inducement for slave states to accept the Compromise was its tie to taxation in the same ratio, so that the burden of taxation on the slave states was also reduced.

A contentious issue at the 1787 Constitutional Convention was whether slaves would be counted as part of the population or would instead be considered property and, as such, not be considered in determining representation of the states in the House of Representatives and the Electoral College. The Southern states wanted each slave to count as a full person, whereas the Northern states did not want them to count at all. Elbridge Gerry asked, why should &quot;blacks, who were property in the South&quot;, count toward representation &quot;any more than the Cattle &amp; horses of the North&quot;?

Although slave states argued that slaves should be considered persons in determining representation, they wanted them considered property if the new government were to levy taxes on the states on the basis of population. Delegates from states where slavery had become rare argued that slaves should be included in taxation, but not in determining representation.

The proposed ratio was a ready solution to the impasse that arose during the Constitutional Convention. In that situation, the alignment of the contending forces was the reverse of what had been obtained under the Articles of Confederation in 1783. In amending the Articles, the North wanted slaves to count for more than the South did because the objective was to determine taxes paid by the states to the federal government. In the Constitutional Convention, the more important issue was representation in Congress, so the South wanted slaves to count for more than the North did.

==Before the Civil War==
By excluding two-fifths of slaves in the legislative apportionment based on population (as provided in the constitution), the Three-fifths Compromise provided reduced representation in the House of Representatives of slave states compared to the free states. Viewed the opposite way, by including three-fifths of slaves in the legislative apportionment (even though they had no voting rights), the Three-fifths Compromise provided additional representation in the House of Representatives of slave states compared to the free states, if representation had been considered based on the non-slave population. Based on the latter view, in 1793, for example, Southern slave states had 47 of the 105 seats, but would have had 33 had seats been assigned based on free populations. In 1812, slave states had 76 seats out of 143 instead of the 59 they would have had; in 1833, 98 seats out of 240, instead of 73. As a result, Southern states had additional influence on the presidency, the speakership of the House, and the Supreme Court until the American Civil War. In addition, the Southern states&#x27; insistence on equal numbers of slave and free states, which was maintained until 1850, safeguarded the Southern bloc in the Senate as well as Electoral College votes.

Historian Garry Wills has speculated that without the additional slave state votes, Jefferson would have lost the presidential election of 1800. Also, &quot;slavery would have been excluded from Missouri ... Jackson&#x27;s Indian removal policy would have failed ... the Wilmot Proviso would have banned slavery in territories won from Mexico ... the Kansas-Nebraska bill would have failed.&quot; While the Three-fifths Compromise could be seen to favor Southern states because of their large slave populations, for example, the Connecticut Compromise tended to favor the Northern states (which were generally smaller). Support for the new Constitution rested on the balance of these sectional interests.

===Debate===
Before the Civil War aspects of the Constitution were subject for significant debate by abolitionists. The Garrisonian view (William Lloyd Garrison (1805–1879), a prominent American abolitionist best known for his widely read anti-slavery newspaper &quot;The Liberator&quot; of the 1830s) of the Constitution was that it was a pro-slavery document and only completely dividing the Union could satisfy the cause of anti-slavery.

Following a bitter series of public debates including one with George Thompson, Frederick Douglass took another view, pointing to the Constitution as an anti-slavery document:

But giving the provisions the very worse construction, what does it amount to? I answer—It is a downright disability laid upon the slaveholding States; one which deprives those States of two-fifths of their natural basis of representation. A black man in a free State is worth just two-fifths more than a black man in a slave State, as a basis of political power under the Constitution. Therefore, instead of encouraging slavery, the Constitution encourages freedom by giving an increase of “two-fifths” of political power to free over slave States. So much for the three-fifths clause; taking it at is worst, it still leans to freedom, not slavery; for, be it remembered that the Constitution nowhere forbids a coloured man to vote.

==After the Civil War==
Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) later superseded Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3 and explicitly repealed the compromise. It provides that &quot;representatives shall be apportioned ... counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.&quot; A later provision of the same clause reduced the Congressional representation of states who denied the right to vote to adult male citizens, but this provision was never effectively enforced. (The Thirteenth Amendment, passed in 1865, had already eliminated almost all persons from the original clause&#x27;s jurisdiction by banning slavery; the only remaining persons subject to it were those sentenced for a crime to penal servitude, which the amendment excluded from the ban.)

After the Reconstruction Era came to an end in 1877, the former slave states subverted the objective of these changes by using terrorism and other illegal tactics to disenfranchise their black citizens, while obtaining the benefit of apportionment of representatives on the basis of the total populations. These measures effectively gave white Southerners even greater voting power than they had in the antebellum era, inflating the number of Southern Democrats in the House of Representatives as well as the number of votes they could exercise in the Electoral College in the election of the president.

The disenfranchisement of black citizens eventually attracted the attention of Congress, and, in 1900, some members proposed stripping the South of seats, related to the number of people who were barred from voting. In the end, Congress did not act to change apportionment, largely because of the power of the Southern bloc. The Southern bloc comprised Southern Democrats voted into office by white voters and constituted a powerful voting bloc in Congress until the 1960s. Their representatives, re-elected repeatedly by one-party states, controlled numerous chairmanships of important committees in both houses on the basis of seniority, giving them control over rules, budgets and important patronage projects, among other issues. Their power allowed them to defeat federal legislation against racial violence and abuses in the South, until overcome by the civil rights movement.

==Historical interpretation==
There is a persistent and sometimes contentious debate among historians, legal scholars, and political scientists over whether the Three-Fifths Compromise should be construed to support the notion that slaves were conceived of not only demographically, but also ontologically, three-fifths of a person or whether the three-fifths was purely a statistical designation used to determine how many representatives Southern states would have in Congress. A frequent claim made in favor of the former argument is that previous electoral precedent held that one man was equivalent to one vote, and the fact that the compromise explicitly tied personhood to votes provides a basis for an ontological reading of the compromise as implying that enslaved people lacked full personhood. Supporters of the statistical argument dispute that ontological considerations were present in the mind of Congress at the time or that the Three-Fifths Compromise had any regard for such notions in its purpose and function. However, it is generally agreed upon and historiographically reflected that enslaved people had no legal recourse or standing to challenge or participate in any kind of electoral legislation or activities of their own accord, which was confirmed 70 years later by the Supreme Court in &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;. This inequality in electoral rights did not substantively change until after the passage of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Nineteenth Amendments as well as the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

<doc id="483267" wikidata="Q76993" url="?curid=483267" title="Glückel of Hameln">
<text>Glückel of Hameln (; also spelled Glückel, Glüeckel, Gllckl Hamel or Glikl of Hamelin; also known as Glikl bas Judah Leib) ( – September 19, 1724) was a German Jewish businesswoman and diarist. Written in her native tongue of Western Yiddish over the course of thirty years, her memoirs were originally intended to be an ethical will for her children and future descendants. Glückel&#x27;s diaries are the only known pre-modern Yiddish memoirs written by a woman. &quot;The Memoirs of Glückel of Hameln&quot; provide an intimate portrait of German-Jewish life between the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries and have become an important source for historians, philologists, sociologists, literary critics, and linguists.

== Background ==

=== Naming conventions ===
Glückel was a popular name in the Middle Ages. The name “Glückel” is diminutive of &quot;Glück,&quot; the German translation of the Hebrew name “Mazal,” meaning “good fortune.” Mazal was exclusively used by Sephardic Jews, while Ashkenazi Jews used either the German variations of &quot;Glück&quot; and &quot;Glueck&quot; or the Yiddish version &quot;Glick.&quot; The ending &quot;el&quot; is a diminutive which indicates &quot;little&quot; or &quot;little one&quot; and was used in the Yiddish and German variations of Glückel, Glukel, Glukil, Glickel, and Glikel. The pseudo-aristocratic variation &quot;Glückel von Hameln&quot; was used by the editor of the memoir&#x27;s first publication in Yiddish.

Despite being referred to by many different variations, her preferred name would have most likely have been &quot;Glikl bas Judah Leib,&quot; meaning &quot;Glikl daughter of Judah Leib,&quot; in keeping with Jewish naming traditions of her time.

==Life and death==
Glückel was born into a wealthy family in the city of Hamburg in 1646 or 1647, one of six children born to Judah Joseph Leib and his second wife Beila. She had one brother, Wolf, and five sisters: Rebekah, Elkel, Hendele, and Mate. Her father was a successful diamond trader and &quot;parnas&quot;, a leader in the Jewish community; her mother was also involved in business. In 1649, when Glückel was less than three years old, her family and the rest of Hamburg&#x27;s Ashkenazic Jewish community was expelled to Altona. Her father had been so respected in Hamburg that he was the first German Jew permitted to return. Glückel&#x27;s father ensured that all of his children were both pious and well-educated, including his daughters. Although she was unable to study the Torah, Glückel received a formal education in a Cheder, the traditional Jewish primary school, where she learned Hebrew and the basics of Judaism.

When she was twelve years old, Glückel was betrothed to Hayyim of Hameln, whom she married in 1660 at the age of fourteen. After the marriage, the couple lived in the groom&#x27;s parents’ home in Hameln. A year after their marriage, the couple moved in with Glückel&#x27;s parents in Hamburg, where Hayyim began dealing in gold and became an affluent businessman. A year after that, they became parents for the first time. Glückel assisted her husband in trading seed pearls, eventually taking over the family business when he died in 1689. She was one of few women who traveled by themselves to conduct trade at European markets and fairs. In addition to her business dealings, Glückel also maintained an extremely active social life which often required extensive travel. Her memoirs tell of travels to cities as varied as Amsterdam, Bamberg, Danzig, Hanover, Hildesheim, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Leipzig, Berlin, Vienna, Metz, and Paris.

Glückel and Hayyim had a total of fourteen children, thirteen of whom survived to adulthood: Zipporah (c. 1661), Nathan (c. 1663), Mata (c. 1666), Mordechai (c. 1670), Hannah (c. 1672), Loeb (c. 1673), Esther (c. 1677), Joseph (c. 1677), Hendelchen (c. 1678), Samuel (c. 1680), Freudchen (c. 1684), Moses (c. 1685), and Miriam (c. 1686). Glückel took great pride in the fact that many of her children were married into some of the most prominent Jewish families of Europe.

In 1700, eleven years after Hayyim&#x27;s death, Glückel remarried. Although she had rejected a number of proposals, she finally acquiesced as she believed that remarrying would ultimately benefit her children by protecting their future. Her second husband was Cerf Levy, a successful banker and &quot;parnas&quot; from Metz. Two years after their marriage, Levy failed financially, losing not only his own fortune but hers as well. Still deep in the throes of bankruptcy, Levy died in 1712, leaving Glückel a widow for the second time. Ever fearful of becoming a burden to her children, Glückel lived alone until falling too ill to care for herself in 1715. At the age of seventy, after much pleading from her children, she moved in with her daughter Esther and her son-in-law Moses.

Glückel died from natural causes on September 19, 1724, in Metz.

== &quot;The Memoirs of Glückel of Hameln&quot; ==
===History of the memoirs===
In 1691, two years after the death of her beloved husband, Glückel began writing her memoirs in an attempt to comfort herself during her immense grief. At the time she was a 46-year-old widow with twelve children, eight of whom remained unmarried. She initially stopped writing the diaries in 1699, shortly before her second marriage to Cerf Levy, but resumed in 1715 while she was living with her daughter following her second husband&#x27;s death. Glückel completed the seventh and final book in 1719.

Glückel was born two years before the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. She lived through, and subsequently wrote about, many other notable historical events, including but not limited to Charles X Gustav of Sweden&#x27;s war on Denmark, the Khmelnytsky Uprising of 1648, the expulsion of the Jewish population of Hamburg to Altona, the scandal of the &quot;Messianic pretender&quot; Sabbatai Zevi, the Franco-Dutch War, and the War of the Spanish Succession. Glückel&#x27;s stories reveal much about the often frightening and precarious situation under which the Jews of northern Germany lived during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.

Glückel&#x27;s diaries, a rare account of an ordinary woman, provide a glimpse into day-to-day life among the Jewish inhabitants of northern Germany in the 17th century. The diaries are the sole pre-modern diary written by a woman in Yiddish. Glückel tells of how she guided the financial and personal destinies of her children through marriage arrangements, engaged in business travel and trade, and generally spent her life promoting the welfare of her large family. Glückel wrote of both her own and her first husband&#x27;s families in great detail because she wanted her children to know about their lineage. She was explicit that the works were to be preserved for future generations, fearing that her children&#x27;s children or grandchildren would one day know nothing of their family history.

The memoirs amalgamate several Jewish literary traditions: the &quot;Tsava&#x27;ah&quot;, or ethical will; the &quot;Tekhines&quot;, or women&#x27;s prayer books; the &quot;Sefer musar&quot;, or book of moral instruction; the &quot;Mayse bukh&quot;, or Yiddish storybook; and the &quot;Family Scroll.&quot;

=== Book One ===
The opening pages of Glückel&#x27;s book include details of her reasons for writing, as well as the underlying beliefs that will come to define her entire narrative. She explains that she began writing her memoirs following the death of her husband of nearly thirty years, Hayyim of Hameln. She explicitly states that she does not wish to write a book of morals for her children to follow; she believes that the Torah provides all of the necessary instructions and thus should be studied diligently. She also states that she intends to complete the memoirs as a series of &quot;seven little books.&quot;

Book One provides much of the backstory of Glückel&#x27;s life. In this book, Glückel tells of her childhood in Hamburg. Though the second chapter begins with her birth, there is almost no reference to her childhood and upbringing except to mention that her father ensured that all of his children, male and female, received both secular and religious education. She mentions that her mother worked making gold and silver lace. Glückel recalls experiences of anti-semitism and how her community was severely impacted by the expulsion of Jews to Altona around 1650. Glückel illustrates her family&#x27;s importance in the community by noting that her father was the first German Jew allowed to resettle in Hamburg. She has memories of the so-called &quot;Swedish Winter&quot; when the Swedes went to war with the King of Denmark, a monarch who she remembered as great man and friend to the Jews. Glückel also tells of the devastating effect that the plague had on Hamburg&#x27;s Jewish community, including the death of her grandmother.

Glückel reveals that her father had been a widower when he married her mother. She remembers the circumstances of her sister Hendele&#x27;s engagement to the son of Reb Gumpel of Cleves, in which Hendele received 1,800 Reichsthalers as her dowry, the most anyone had ever been dowered in Hamburg. Glückel recalls that the match been the most important in all of Germany and that &quot;the whole world admired its excellence and the size of the dowry.&quot;

=== Book Two ===
Book Two is one of the shortest of the seven books, and it is also the most joyful. This book begins with Glückel&#x27;s betrothal to Hayyim of Hameln at age twelve and their marriage two years later; the relationship was arranged by her father. After Glückel and Hayyim were married in Hameln, they moved in with his parents where she was &quot;alone with strangers in a strange world.&quot; She recalls her first impressions of Hameln being &quot;a dull shabby hole&quot; and &quot;back-country town where lived only two Jews.&quot; She was ultimately not discouraged by her new surroundings, however, because of how well she was treated by her in-laws, especially her father-in-law, Joseph Hameln.

She spends most of the second book giving details about Hayyim&#x27;s family. She tells the story of Hayyim&#x27;s eldest brother, Moses, who was shot and killed while being robbed on the way to his own wedding. Joseph&#x27;s second son, Abraham, was a brilliant Talmud scholar who faced many hardships in his life, including difficulties conceiving without what was rumored to be mystical intervention. Hayyim had a sister named Yenta, who experienced great personal turmoil after marrying the son of the wealthy Sussmann Gans of Minden-on-the-Weser. The fourth child of the family, Samuel, studied in Poland and married the daughter of the prominent Rabbi Sholem of Lemberg. Glückel never met the fifth child, Isaac, who died at age fifty in Frankfort-on-the-Main. Glückel writes very little about Hayyim&#x27;s sister Esther, stating instead that &quot;all the world knows the excellent woman she was.&quot; The seventh child, Loeb, lived in Bonn. He died young &quot;but in riches and honor.&quot; Hannah was the eighth child who, like Loeb, also died very young; she, however, was without any wealth. Hayyim was the ninth child, referred to in this book as &quot;your faithful father.&quot; He is not discussed at length in the chapter, however, as Glückel advises that the details will be found in the coming pages instead.

=== Book Three ===
Signs of Glückel&#x27;s business acumen begin to appear in Book Three. She reveals that her husband took business and financial advice from her and no one else, stating that he did nothing in business without her knowledge. Glückel mentions that she drafted a business contract when her husband took ill on a trading trip to Leipzig, a prime example of her husband&#x27;s utmost confidence in her business capabilities. Hayyim&#x27;s illness in Leipzig was particularly stressful for Glückel because of the well-known danger that the city posed to Jews. Although Jews were allowed to do business at the Leipzig Fair due to the high taxes they paid, they had not been allowed to live in Saxony since 1537. Glückel knew that if Hayyim had died in Leipzig, it would have been difficult to recover his body for a proper Jewish burial and that all of his possessions would be forfeited, resulting in major personal as well as financial damages.

In this book, Glückel tells of the commotion caused by the false prophet Sabbatai Zevi and how it impacted her family. As the plague continues, Glückel explains of the difficulty of conducting trade and receiving mail, as well as the strange illness and remarkable recovery of her daughter Zipporah, to whom she refers as the &quot;Virgin of Peinholz.&quot; Over the course of Book Three, Glückel gives birth to two more daughters, Mata and Hannah. Unfortunately, at age three, Mata contracted a mysterious and painful illness which made her hands and feet swell; she died four weeks later.

=== Book Four ===
Glückel has another child in this volume, a son named Mordecai. Glückel gives more insight into her social and economic status by mentioning that she employs a servant named &quot;Elegant Sam,&quot; who had been a replacement for a &quot;Clumsy Sam.&quot; Zipporah follows in her mother&#x27;s footsteps and is also engaged at age twelve, and the townspeople place bets on her marriage. Glückel tells of her embarrassment when, during the marriage ceremony, it was discovered that the &quot;ketubah,&quot; or Jewish marriage contract, had not been written; although the wedding proceeded without the official contract, this went against custom and Glückel feared that the community would react negatively. Zipporah&#x27;s wedding is the first of many which are described at length in the memoirs. Glückel mentions the attendance of nobility as well as the performance of the &quot;Dance of Death.&quot; Glückel suffers the loss of her beloved sister Hendel, who is buried in Emmerich. She mentions the dangers of sailing from Wangerooge to Hamburg due to pirates. By this time, her son Nathan is fifteen and becomes involved in the family business. Glückel and Hayyim have another daughter, Esther.

Glückel details many economic woes, including the loss of 11,000 Reichsthalers in one year. In a stroke of bittersweet luck, Glückel&#x27;s father dies after suffering from gout and she gives birth to her son, Loeb, after sitting shiva. Glückel details the distribution of her father&#x27;s will, which left 1,600 Reichsthalers to her mother and about 1,400 Reichsthalers to each of his children; although Glückel&#x27;s husband and brother-in-law were entitled to a claim of half the share of a son, they insisted that the money be given to Glückel&#x27;s mother and her children only. Glückel details the excellent treatment of her mother by her sons-in-law after she became a widow. Glückel notes that her mother&#x27;s age at widowhood was forty-four and remarks on the fact that she never remarried. Glückel also mentions the existence of other female-authored wills, indicating that her memoirs were not an anomaly for the time.

She gives her impressions of the war between the King of France, Holland, and the Emperor. Hayyim again falls ill on a business trip, this time in Halberstadt. Glückel&#x27;s father-in-law had died three years before she began writing the fourth book, and she tells a story about her daughter Hannah&#x27;s experience with a ghostly presence the night before he died. She writes of her husband&#x27;s experience with s&quot;hneim asar chodesh&quot;, the twelve-month period of mourning for one&#x27;s parent. Her mother-in-law died two years later at age eighty-two and was buried next to her husband. Glückel celebrates her daughter Esther and son Nathan both becoming engaged, but she also mourns losing an unnamed child in infancy. She describes her experience of giving birth every two years, a period which had begun with her daughter Hendele; two sons, Samuel and Moses, and two daughters, Freudchen and Miriam, followed. The book ends with the death of Hayyim, the &quot;crown of [her] head,&quot; in 1689. She laments being left with eight unmarried children and mentions that the four married children also still need help.

=== Book Five ===
Book Five deals extensively with the sickness and eventual death of Hayyim. On January 11, 1689, he fell on a sharp stone, agitating his already long-suffering and &quot;badly twisted bowels.&quot; Hayyim initially refused to call for a doctor for want of privacy, but he eventually calls for Abraham Lopez, a physician and &quot;chirurgeon-barber.&quot; Glückel offers her body to console or comfort her dying husband, but he refuses her because she is &quot;unclean&quot; due to menstruation and had not visited the &quot;mikveh&quot;. Hayyim dies on Shabbat while reciting the first lines of the prayer Shema Yisrael: &quot;Hear O&#x27;Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One!&quot; He is buried January 16, 1689, after which the customary week of mourning commenced. Glückel describes her grief in great detail and also reveals that she felt that she was forgotten by the community after the mourning period ended.

Hayyim died 20,000 Reichsthalers in debt, but Glückel&#x27;s business acumen ensured that the debts were completely cleared within a year. Life gradually returns to normal as Glückel officially takes over control of the business and family. She describes difficulty with her son Loeb&#x27;s marriage plans as well as business decisions. After Loeb falls deep into debt after going into business for himself in Berlin, she begins to see the city as cursed. This feeling deepens after her daughter Hendele falls sick and dies there, only seventeen weeks after she got married. She describes how a trusted Talmud teacher misled her son Joseph at the age of fourteen. Glückel recalls the murders of Abraham Metz and Aaron ben Moses, a story which illustrates the complicated relationships that existed between Jews and Gentiles in Hamburg.

=== Book Six ===
Book Six opens with a sense of deep regret. Glückel describes her second marriage as the &quot;change in life [she] sought to avoid.&quot; She interprets her second marriage as a punishment for her sins, especially for not committing herself to God after Hayyim&#x27;s death. She tells of her secret betrothal to Cerf Levy, a widower from Metz, which occurred in June 1699. She relates the story of King Jedijah from Araby to illustrate how even good intentions, such as her desire to protect her children by remarrying, can sometimes go terribly wrong.

Although Glückel agrees to the marriage with the assurance that her new husband was a wise businessman who would offer her &quot;nothing but abundance,&quot; she recalls her extreme hesitation. She details difficulties with both her new step-children and the Levy family&#x27;s staff which included two manservants, two maids, and &quot;numerous lackeys.&quot; Glückel describes how distraught she was after she learned her troubled son Loeb had died, expressing her grief with the story of King David and his son Absalom. Glückel ends Book Six expresses her fears for her family with a desperate plea for God&#x27;s forgiveness: &quot;May the Almighty God spare us and Israel from further evil, and in His great mercy and grace forgive us sinners all our debts, and lead us back to the Holy Land, that our eyes may see the rebuilding of Thy holy house and our glory restored!&quot;

=== Book Seven ===
According to Glückel, the final book &quot;contains both pleasures and pains, as does the world itself.&quot; In this book, both her son Samuel and her second husband die. Samuel dies less than two years after the move to Metz and leaves behind a pregnant widow. After twelve years of marriage, Cerf dies on July 24, 1712. Glückel was unable to recover even her initial dowry because his business was in such a state of ruin at the time of his death. She recalls the dissatisfaction of living in the home of Jacob Marburg, an otherwise unidentified Metz resident who provided her with a room which featured &quot;neither hearth nor chimney.&quot; Being old and ill, she had difficulty getting up the twenty-two stairs which led to her bedroom. Despite her previous protests, Glückel eventually gives in to her son-in-law Moses Krumbach&#x27;s demands to move in with him and his wife, Esther. In 1715, she finally moves in with her daughter and son-in-law and experiences life in a rapidly changing Metz. The memoirs close with the following passage:&quot;In the month of Nisan, 5479 [March–April 1719], a woman was kneeling by the bank of the Moselle, washing her dishes. It was about ten o&#x27;clock at night, and of a sudden it became as light as day, and the woman looked in the Heavens, and the Heavens were opened, like unto a...[word illegible]...and sparks flew therefrom; and then the Heavens closed, as one closes a curtain, and all was dark again. God grant that it be for our good!&quot;

=== Translations ===
The original manuscript was lost, but a copy made by Glückel&#x27;s son Moses survived. The family copy was used to create the first printed edition entitled &quot;Zikhroynes&quot; (Yiddish for &quot;Memoirs&quot;), which was edited by David Kaufmann and published in 1896. Bertha Pappenheim, one of Glückel&#x27;s great-granddaughters, published the first German translation of the &quot;Memoirs&quot; in 1910. In 1913, an alternate abridged German translation by Alfred Feilchenfeld was published and, due to its immense popularity, went into its fourth edition by 1923. Feilchenfeld&#x27;s edition eventually became the basis of the first English translation by Marvin Lowenthal, published in 1932 and reissued in 1960 and 1977. In 1962, Beth-Zion Abrahams offered a more accurate English translation of the original Kaufmann edition. An abridged Hebrew translation based on the Feilchenfeld edition was published by A. Z. Rabinowitz in Tel Aviv in 1930. Joseph Berenfeld completed a full translation of the memoirs into modern Yiddish in 1967.

==Legacy and descendants==
The permanent exhibition at the Jewish Museum Berlin (&quot;Jüdisches Museum Berlin&quot;) featured Glückel of Hameln from 2001 to 2017. &quot;Two Millennia of German-Jewish History&quot; was broken down into fourteen periods spanning from the Middle Ages to the present, with Glückel representing the Baroque period. The exhibit has been closed since 2017 for a complete redesign and is expected to re-open on August 23, 2020. It is still unclear if Glückel will be featured in the new redesign.

Her memoirs have been adapted several times. Margoa Winston&#x27;s fictionalized &quot;Glückel Von Hameln: a Dramatization of Her Autobiography&quot; appeared in print in 1941. Adrienne Cooper and Frank London of the Great Small Works theater troupe brought the memoirs to the stage in the early 2000s. The production combined puppetry with European storytelling traditions and was performed in both Yiddish and English.

In 2016, a street in Hamburg was named after Glückel. Glückel-von-Hameln-Straße is located in the borough of Altona, the same place to which her family and all other Hamburg Jews were exiled in 1648.

Because her family lineage is so well documented, it has been possible to identify many of her descendants. Among these are notable figures such as Bertha Pappenheim, Heinrich Heine, and Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch.

<doc id="483269" wikidata="Q1617382" url="?curid=483269" title="Province of New Hampshire">
<text>The Province of New Hampshire was an English colony and later a British province in New England. It corresponds to the territory between the Merrimack and Piscataqua rivers on the eastern coast of North America. It was named after the English county of Hampshire in southern England by Captain John Mason in 1629, its first named proprietor. In 1776, the province established an independent state and government, the State of New Hampshire, and joined with twelve other colonies to form the United States.

Europeans first settled New Hampshire in the 1620s, and the province consisted for many years of a small number of communities along the seacoast, Piscataqua River, and Great Bay. In 1641 the communities were organized under the government of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, until Charles II issued a colonial charter for the province and appointed John Cutt as President of New Hampshire in 1679. After a brief period as a separate province, the territory was absorbed into the Dominion of New England in 1686. Following the collapse of the unpopular Dominion, on October 7, 1691 New Hampshire was again separated from Massachusetts and organized as an English crown colony. Its charter was enacted on May 14, 1692, during the coregency of William and Mary, the joint monarchs of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Between 1699 and 1741, the province&#x27;s governor was often concurrently the governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay. This practice ended completely in 1741, when Benning Wentworth was appointed governor. Wentworth laid claim on behalf of the province to lands west of the Connecticut River, east of the Hudson River, and north of Massachusetts, issuing controversial land grants that were disputed by the Province of New York, which also claimed the territory. These disputes resulted in the eventual formation of the Vermont Republic and the U.S. state of Vermont.

The province&#x27;s economy was dominated by timber and fishing. The timber trade, although lucrative, was a subject of conflict with the crown, which sought to reserve the best trees for use as ship masts. Although the Puritan leaders of Massachusetts ruled the province for many years, the New Hampshire population was religiously diverse, originating in part in its early years with refugees from opposition to religious differences in Massachusetts.

From the 1680s until 1760, New Hampshire was often on the front lines of military conflicts with New France and the Abenaki people, seeing major attacks on its communities in King William&#x27;s War, Dummer&#x27;s War, and King George&#x27;s War. The province was at first not strongly in favor of independence, but with the outbreak of armed conflict at Lexington and Concord many of its inhabitants joined the revolutionary cause. After Governor John Wentworth fled New Hampshire in August 1775, the inhabitants adopted a constitution in early 1776. Independence as part of the United States was confirmed with the 1783 Treaty of Paris.

==Before colonization==
Prior to English colonization, the area that is now northeastern New England was populated by bands of the Abenaki, who lived in sometimes-large villages of longhouses. Depending on the season, they would either remain near their villages to fish, gather plants, engage in sugaring, and trade or fight with their neighbors, or head to nearby fowling and hunting grounds; later they also farmed tobacco and the &quot;three sisters&quot;: corn, beans, and squash. The seacoast was explored in the early years of the 17th century by English and French explorers, including Samuel de Champlain and John Smith.

==Early English settlement==
Permanent English settlement began after land grants were issued in 1622 to John Mason and Sir Ferdinando Gorges for the territory between the Merrimack and Sagadahoc (Kennebec) rivers, roughly encompassing present-day New Hampshire and western Maine. Settlers, whose early leaders included David Thomson, Edward Hilton and his brother William Hilton, began settling the New Hampshire coast as early as 1623, and eventually expanded along the shores of the Piscataqua River and the Great Bay. These settlers were mostly intending to profit from the local fisheries. Mason and Gorges, neither of whom ever came to New England, divided their claims along the Piscataqua River in 1629. Mason took the territory between the Piscataqua and Merrimack, and called it &quot;New Hampshire&quot;, after the English county of Hampshire.

Conflicts between holders of grants issued by Mason and Gorges concerning their boundaries eventually led to a need for more active management. In 1630, Captain Walter Neale was sent as chief agent and governor of the lower settlements on the Piscataqua (including Strawbery Banke, present-day Portsmouth), and in 1631 Captain Thomas Wiggin was sent to govern the upper settlements, comprising modern-day Dover, Durham and Stratham. After Mason died in 1635, the colonists and employees of Mason appropriated many of his holdings to themselves. Exeter was founded in 1638 by John Wheelwright, after he had been banished from the neighboring Massachusetts Bay Colony for defending the teachings of Anne Hutchinson, his sister-in-law. In the absence of granting authority from anyone associated with the Masons, Wheelwright&#x27;s party purchased the land from local Indians. His party included William Wentworth, whose descendants came to play a major role in colonial history. Around the same time, others unhappy with the strict Puritan rule in Massachusetts settled in Dover, while Puritans from Massachusetts settled what eventually became Hampton.

Because of a general lack of government, the New Hampshire settlements sought the protection of their larger neighbor to the south, the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In 1641, they collectively agreed to be governed from Massachusetts, provided the towns retained self-rule, and that Congregational Church membership was not required for their voters (as it was in Massachusetts). The settlements formed part of that colony until 1679, sending representatives to the Massachusetts legislature in Boston. Mason&#x27;s heirs were in the meantime active in England, seeking to regain control of their territory, and Massachusetts was coming under increasing scrutiny by King Charles II. In 1679, Charles issued a charter establishing the Province of New Hampshire, with John Cutt as its first president.

==First royal charters==
In January 1680, Cutt took office, ending Massachusetts governance. However, Cutt and his successor, Richard Waldron, were strongly opposed to the Mason heirs and their claims. Consequently, Charles issued a second charter in 1682 with Edward Cranfield as governor. Cranfield strongly supported the Mason heirs, making so many local enemies in the process that he was recalled in 1685. In 1686, the territory was brought into the Dominion of New England, an attempt to unify all of the New England colonies into a single government. The New Hampshire towns did not suffer as much under the rule of Sir Edmund Andros as did Massachusetts. After word of the Glorious Revolution reached Boston, Massachusetts authorities conspired to have Andros arrested and sent back to England. This left the New Hampshire towns without any colonial administration, just as King William&#x27;s War erupted around them. Subjected to significant French and Indian raids, they appealed to Massachusetts Governor Simon Bradstreet, who oversaw them until William III and Mary II issued new, separate charters in 1691 for both Massachusetts and New Hampshire.

==1691 charter==
Samuel Allen, a businessman who had acquired the Mason claims, was appointed the first governor under the 1691 charter. He was equally unsuccessful in pursuing the Mason land claims, and was replaced in 1699 by the Earl of Bellomont. Bellomont was the first in a series of governors who ruled both New Hampshire and the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Until 1741 the governorships were shared, with the governor spending most of his time in Massachusetts. As a result, the lieutenant governors held significant power. The dual governorship became problematic in part because of territorial claims between Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Since the southern border of the original Mason grant was the Merrimack River, and the Massachusetts charter specified a boundary three miles north of the same river, the claims conflicted, and were eventually brought to the king&#x27;s attention. In 1741, King George II decreed what is now the border between Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and separated the governorships, issuing a commission to Benning Wentworth as New Hampshire governor.

Wentworth broadly interpreted New Hampshire&#x27;s territorial claims, believing that territories west of the Connecticut River belonged to New Hampshire. In a scheme that was effective at lining his own pockets, he sold land grants in this territory for relatively low prices, but required parts of the grants to be allocated to himself. These grants brought New Hampshire into conflict with the Province of New York, the other claimant to the territory. King George III in 1764 ruled in New York&#x27;s favor, setting off a struggle between the holders of the New Hampshire Grants and New York authorities that eventually resulted in the formation of the state of Vermont. The controversy also resulted in the replacement of Wentworth by his nephew John, who would be the last royal governor of the province.

Since the province was on the northern frontier bordering New France, its communities were frequently attacked during King William&#x27;s War and Queen Anne&#x27;s War, and then again in the 1720s during Dummer&#x27;s War. Because of these wars the Indian population in the northern parts of the province declined, but settlements only slowly expanded into the province&#x27;s interior. The province was partitioned into counties in 1769, later than the other twelve colonies that revolted against the British Empire.

==American Revolution==
Twelve other colonies joined with New Hampshire in resisting attempts by the British Parliament to impose taxes. After the American Revolutionary War began in April 1775, the province recruited regiments that served in the Siege of Boston, and was the first former European colony to formally establish an independent government, as the State of New Hampshire, in January 1776.

==Demographics==
From 1630 to 1780, the population of New Hampshire grew from 500 to 87,802. In 1623, the first permanent English settlements, Dover and Rye, were established, while Portsmouth was the largest city by 1773 with a population of 4,372. The black population in the colony grew from 30 in 1640 to 674 in 1773 (ranging between 1 and 4 percent of the population), but declined to 541 (or 0.6 percent of the population) by 1780.

In New Hampshire, unlike some of the other New England Colonies, the Puritan Congregational church was not the established church in the colony. Following the First Great Awakening (1730–1755), the number of regular places of worship in New Hampshire had grown to 46 in 1750 (40 Congregational, five Presbyterian, and one Anglican), and to 125 regular places of worship by 1776 (78 Congregational, 27 Presbyterian, 13 Baptist, four Friends, two Episcopal, and one New Light Congregational).

<text>The Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) is a relief service, and peace agency representing fifteen Mennonite, Brethren in Christ and Amish bodies in North America. The U.S. headquarters are located in Akron, Pennsylvania; the Canadian headquarters is located in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

==History==
Founded in Chicago, Illinois, MCC held its first meeting on September 27, 1920. Its original goal was to provide food for Mennonites starving in Ukraine. MCC soon realized that it could not help only their Mennonite brothers and sisters and began to help anyone in need. MCC (Canada) was founded in 1963.

The initial work of MCC focused on:
:1920–1925: famine relief work in Ukraine.
:1925–1930: inactive
:1930–1937: colonization of Russian Mennonite and Bruderhof refugees in Paraguay and Brazil.
:1939–present: relief work; initially in Poland, then (1940) England and France.
:1941–1947: administration of Civilian Public Service (CPS) as part of National Service Board for Religious Objectors.
:1950s: administration of 1-W service, the replacement of CPS, for draftees classified as conscientious objectors.

===Famine in Ukraine===
The Mennonites of Molotschna sent a committee to North America in the summer of 1920 to alert American Mennonites of the dire conditions in war-torn Ukraine. Their plight succeeded in uniting various branches of Mennonites to form Mennonite Central Committee in an effort to aid these Russian Mennonites. P. C. Hiebert of the Mennonite Brethren Church initially chaired the organization, with secretary Levi Mumaw of the (Old) Mennonite Church and attorney Maxwell Kratz of the General Conference Mennonite Church. Other Mennonite conferences joined later.

The new organization planned to provide aid to Ukraine via existing Mennonite relief work in Istanbul. The Istanbul group, mainly Goshen College graduates, produced three volunteers, who at great risk entered Ukraine during the ongoing Russian Civil War. They arrived in the Mennonite village of Halbstadt just as General Wrangel of the White Army was retreating. Two of the volunteers withdrew with the Wrangel army, while Clayton Kratz, who remained in Halbstadt (Molotschna) as the Red Army overran the village, was never heard from again.

A year passed before official permission was received from the Soviet government to do relief work among the villages of Ukraine. Kitchens provided 25,000 people a day with rations over a period of three years beginning in 1922, with a peak of 40,000 servings during August of that year. Fifty Fordson tractor and plow combinations were sent to Mennonite villages to replace horses that had been stolen and confiscated during the war. This relief effort cost $1.2 million.

===Voluntary service===
Lois Gunden volunteered for the Mennonite Central Committee in 1941 and established an orphanage for refuge children of the Spanish Civil War and Jewish children from Rivesaltes internment camp. The children that she rescued were malnourished, in poor health, and had lice. She was awarded the title Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem for her efforts to care for and protect children.

As Civilian Public Service started to wind down in 1946, MCC began exploring a peacetime service program that would continue the types of projects performed by CPS. The new program, Voluntary Service, had several aims.
It would provide young people with a way to voluntarily perform Christian service for up to a year as a means of testifying more widely to the gospel and its way of love and nonresistance. Projects were to help alleviate human need in a culturally sensitive manner. The program would operate as an internship in Christian service, developing the workers&#x27; service motivation, witness and religious conviction. It would provide Mennonite young people with an opportunity to express appreciation for the material blessings, religious and other national liberties and to contribute to the well-being of the nation. Finally, it was hoped that some individuals would decide to devote their careers to full-time ministry or missionary service.

The first Voluntary Service unit started during the summer of 1946 in association with the CPS unit at Gulfport, Mississippi .

==Activities==
MCC was an early proponent of fair trade through its Ten Thousand Villages program.

Funds for MCC&#x27;s worldwide relief and service projects are raised through independent Mennonite relief sales. Around 45 sales are held throughout the United States and Canada, raising US$5 million annually. Many of these sales feature quilts handmade by Mennonite and Amish volunteers, auctions, artwork, crafted woodwork, homemade foods, antiques, crafts, plants, children&#x27;s activities, and musical programs. Most of the goods and labor are donated, and 78.2% of the funds raised go directly into the field.

MCC focuses its development efforts in areas such as food security and livelihoods, health, education, peace and justice, and fair trade. It responds to disaster situations, as well as focusing its efforts on the longer-term issues of economic and social policy.

MCC maintains offices in both Washington, D.C., and Ottawa to advocate to the American and Canadian federal governments, respectively. MCC also has an international advocacy office at the United Nations in New York City. As of 2015, Ewuare Osayande served as the group&#x27;s Anti-Oppression Coordinator.

===Peacemaking===
MCC also takes an active role in advocating for peace both in North America and around the world, seeking &quot;to be a witness against forces that contribute to poverty, injustice and violence.&quot; In North America, MCC established the Mennonite Conciliation Service (MCS) in 1979 to encourage Mennonites and others to actively pursue peaceful resolution of conflicts. MCS was a pioneer in the burgeoning field of conflict resolution in the 1980s and director Ronald S. Kraybill led early mediation workshops in Northern Ireland which eventually led to the establishment of the Northern Ireland Mediation Network. John Paul Lederach took over MCS in 1989 when Kraybill moved on to South Africa, and in the years following, MCC moved active peace building into the forefront of its work abroad.

Responding in part to the establishment of active Mennonite-led peace centers that had emerged in the 80s and 90s, such as the Conflict Transformation Program at Eastern Mennonite University, the Lombard Mennonite Peace Center in Lombard, Illinois, a group of peace builders at Fresno Pacific University, the Peace and Justice Network of the Mennonite Church and other activities, MCS was discontinued in 2004. But the Peace Office of MCC continues to advocate peace interests broadly in the US and in MCC programming abroad. Internationally, MCC partners with local organizations to reduce violence in the aftermath of conflict or war.

MCC advocates for exemption from military service. Alternative service for conscientious objectors is promoted as their witness to New Testament Scriptures. MCC keeps a &quot;conscientious objector registry&quot; in Canada, taking statements from Canadians in the hope that they will be recognized by the Canadian government should the government restart drafting citizens into the military.

<text>Alvin Curling (born November 15, 1939) is a Jamaican-born Canadian politician. He was Canada&#x27;s envoy to the Dominican Republic from 2005 to 2006. A former politician in Ontario, Canada, he was Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario until he resigned on August 19, 2005 to accept his diplomatic appointment. He had been a Liberal MPP for twenty years, from 1985 to 2005.

==Background==

Curling was educated at Seneca College and at York University in Toronto. He began working as an educator in 1972, and served as President of the World Literacy of Canada organization from 1981 to 1984, as well as working in the Jamaican Canadian Association.

==Politics==

===In government===
He was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1985 as a Liberal in the suburban Toronto riding of Scarborough North. Curling defeated Progressive Conservative candidate Carole Noble by about 8,000 votes. His personal total of 30,504 votes was a provincial record at the time.

The Liberals formed a minority government after this election, and Curling was appointed Minister of Housing on June 26, 1985. He was the first Black Canadian to hold a cabinet-level position in Ontario. During his time as minister of Housing, he expanded the parameters of Ontario&#x27;s rent control program, and announced a $500 million initiative for new urban housing. Curling was easily re-elected in the provincial election of 1987, and was appointed Minister of Skills Development on September 29, 1987. He served in this capacity until August 2, 1989, when he was dropped from cabinet.

====Cabinet positions====

===In opposition===
The Liberals were defeated by the NDP in the 1990 election, although Curling managed to retain his riding by about 4,000 votes. He was also re-elected without much difficulty in the face of Progressive Conservative majority governments of 1995 and 1999 in the redistributed riding of Scarborough—Rouge River. From 1996 to 1999, he served as Deputy House Leader for the Liberals.

In December 1995, he gained notoriety for his 18-hour filibuster-like protest against the Mike Harris government&#x27;s Omnibus Bill 26. When Curling was ordered expelled from the legislature for refusing to vote, he was ordered by the speaker to leave the chamber. He refused to leave his seat, and a knot of fellow Liberal and NDP opposition members formed a cordon around him to prevent his physical removal. The standoff lasted throughout the night and into the next morning when the house was adjourned. Reports stated that when legislature staff saw Frances Lankin, NDP MPP and a former prison guard, among the cordon, they backed off. Curling claimed his protest was meant to highlight a lack of public consultation in the Harris government&#x27;s bill. The incident led to a discussion amongst the party house leaders and an agreement was reached to review the bill clause by clause.

Curling supported Joseph Cordiano for the Ontario Liberal Party leadership in 1996 (&quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;, November 21, 1996).

===Speaker of the Legislature===

The Liberals returned to power following the provincial election of 2003, and Curling was elected Speaker of the Legislature without opposition on November 19, 2003.

Curling soon faced criticism over as charges of partisanship and how objectively he was performing his duties as Speaker. Opposition MPPs, including New Democrat Peter Kormos and Conservative John Baird, noted that Curling favoured his Liberal colleagues, sanctioning Conservative and NDP members for behaviour he would more often let slide from Liberals. Curling had also been criticized for attending Liberal Party fundraiser while Speaker, as previous Speakers had avoided attending such events which was seen as compromising the impartiality of the office. In late March 2005, Kormos announced plans to introduce a resolution calling on Curling to resign from the post, and it was rumoured Conservatives were considering a similar call.

==After politics==
Curling resigned his seat in the Legislative Assembly on August 19, 2005, to accept a diplomatic posting as Canada&#x27;s ambassador to the Dominican Republic. He was recalled from this position in 2006 following the defeat of the federal Liberal government.

Curling held a position as Senior Fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI) in Waterloo, Ontario, from June 2007 until May 2010. He also served as Co-Chair of the Premier&#x27;s Task Force on the Review of the Roots of Youth Violence. In the mid-2000s, Curling was honoured by the government of Jamaica with the Order of Distinction; he holds the rank of Commander. In 2014, he was made a Member of the Order of Ontario for having &quot;played an important role in shaping government policy addressing youth violence&quot;.
