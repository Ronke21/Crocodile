<text>Live oak or evergreen oak is any of a number of oaks in several different sections of the genus &quot;Quercus&quot; that share the characteristic of evergreen foliage. These oaks are generally not more closely related to each other than they are to other oaks. When the term live oak is used in a specific rather than general sense, it most commonly refers to the group of species under &quot;Quercus&quot; sect. &quot;Virentes&quot;, which includes the southern live oak (&quot;Quercus virginiana&quot;), the first species so named, and an icon of the Old South.

The name &quot;live oak&quot; comes from the fact that evergreen oaks remain green and &quot;live&quot; throughout winter, when other oaks are dormant and leafless. The name is used mainly in North America, where evergreen oaks are widespread in warmer areas along the Atlantic coast from southeast Virginia to Florida, west along the Gulf Coast to Louisiana and Mexico, and across the southwest to California.

Evergreen oak species are also common in parts of southern Europe and south Asia, and are included in this list for the sake of completeness. These species, although not having &quot;live&quot; in their common names in their countries of origin, are colloquially called live oaks when cultivated in North America.

According to the Live Oak Society the oldest southern live oak is believed to be the Seven Sisters Oak located in Mandeville, Louisiana with an estimated age of 500–1,000 years.

The southern live oak is the official state tree of Georgia.

The Seal of Texas includes a live oak branch.

==Wood and lumber==

Live oak was widely used in early American butt shipbuilding. Because of the trees&#x27; short height and low-hanging branches, lumber from live oaks was used in curved parts of the frame, such as knee braces (single-piece, L-shaped braces that spring inward from the side and support the deck), in which the grain runs perpendicular to structural stress, making for exceptional strength. Live oaks were not generally used for planking because the curved and often convoluted shape of the tree did not lend itself to being milled to planking of any length. &quot;The world&#x27;s oldest floating ship, the USS Constitution, launched in 1797, got its nickname &quot;Old Ironsides&quot; during the War of 1812 after its hull, made in part of live oak, proved equal to the fearsome cannons of the British&quot;. 

Loggers had cut down most of the live oak trees in southern Europe by the latter half of the 19th century. Live oak timber from the United States was similarly sought and exported until metal-hulled commercial vessels became the norm in the early part of the 20th century. Live oak lumber is rarely used for furniture, because it warps and twists while drying.

The wood of live oaks continues to be used occasionally in shipbuilding—and in tool handles for its strength, energy absorption, and density, although modern composites are often substituted with good effect. Dry Southern live oak lumber has a specific gravity of 0.88, among the highest of North American hardwoods.

<text>Hit the Deck is a musical with music by Vincent Youmans, lyrics by Clifford Grey and Leo Robin and book by Herbert Fields. It was based on the 1922 play &quot;Shore Leave&quot; by Hubert Osborne. The title refers to a nautical slang term that means to prepare for action (general) or to drop to a prone position on the ground (as a defensive response to hostile fire). The musical is set in China and Newport, Rhode Island, and on a ship traveling between the two locations.

The original production was staged at the Belasco Theatre on Broadway, opening on April 25, 1927, and running for 352 performances. Charles King played Bilge and Louise Groody played Loulou. The show&#x27;s co-producers were Youmans and Lew Fields, and Lew Fields co-directed with Alexander Leftwich. The production ran for 352 performances.

The first London production opened at the Hippodrome on July 3, 1927 and ran for 277 performances. It starred Stanley Holloway. In &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, Ivor Brown praised Holloway for a singing style &quot;which coaxes the ear rather than clubbing the head.&quot;

<text>Saint John&#x27;s Eve, starting at sunset on 23 June, is the eve of the feast day of Saint John the Baptist. This is one of the very few feast days marking a saint&#x27;s birth, rather than their death. The Gospel of Luke (Luke 1:26–37, 56–57) states that John was born six months before Jesus; therefore, the feast of John the Baptist was fixed on 24 June, six months before Christmas. In the Roman calendar, 24 June was the date of the summer solstice, and Saint John&#x27;s Eve is closely associated with Midsummer festivities in Europe. Traditions are similar to those of May Day and include bonfires (St John&#x27;s fires), feasting, processions, church services, and gathering wild plants.

== History ==

Saint John&#x27;s Day, the feast day of Saint John the Baptist, was established by the undivided Christian Church in the 4th century A.D., in honour of the birth of Saint John the Baptist, which the Christian Bible records as being six months before Jesus. As the Western Christian churches mark the birth of Jesus on 25 December (Christmas), the feast marking the birth of Saint John (Saint John&#x27;s Day) was set six months before.

In the ancient Roman world, 24 June was the traditional date of the summer solstice and 25 December the date of the winter solstice, both of which were marked by festivals.

Within Christian theology, John the Baptist &quot;was understood to be preparing the way for Jesus&quot;, with stating &quot;He must increase, but I must decrease&quot;; this is symbolized in the fact that the sun&#x27;s height in the sky and length of the day &quot;begins to diminish&quot; after the summer solstice and begins to increase after the winter solstice. By the 6th century A.D., several churches were dedicated to Saint John the Baptist and a vigil, Saint John&#x27;s Eve, was added to the feast day. Christian priests held three Masses for the celebration.

The historian Ronald Hutton states that the &quot;lighting of festive fires upon St. John&#x27;s Eve is first recorded as a popular custom by Jean Belethus, a theologian at the University of Paris, in the early twelfth century&quot;, but is undoubtedly much older. In England, the earliest reference to this custom occurs on in the 13th century A.D., in the &quot;Liber Memorandum&quot; of the parish church at Barnwell in the Nene Valley, which stated that parish youth would gather on the day to light fires, sing songs and play games.

In the 16th century A.D., the English historian John Stow, described the celebration of Saint John&#x27;s Day:
== Widespread customs ==

Fire is the most typical element associated with Saint John&#x27;s Eve celebrations. Bonfires (commonly called Saint John&#x27;s Fires in various languages) were lit in honour of St. John on Saint John&#x27;s Eve and Saint John&#x27;s Day, and served to repel witches and evil spirits. A Christian interpretation of carrying lighted torches on St John&#x27;s Eve is that they are &quot;an emblem of St. John the Baptist, who was &#x27;a burning and shining light,&#x27; and the preparer of the way of Christ&quot;. These traditions are very similar to those of May Day.

Saint John&#x27;s Day is also a popular day for infant baptisms and in the 19th century, &quot;baptisms of children who had died &#x27;pagans&#x27; were acted out&quot;. In Sweden, young people visited holy springs as &quot;a reminder of how John the Baptist baptised Christ in the River Jordan.&quot; On Saint John&#x27;s Eve in Switzerland, goatsbeard and masterwort were fashioned into a cross and then were taken to one&#x27;s local church, where they were blessed by a Christian priest.

Today, common Saint John&#x27;s Eve and Saint John&#x27;s Day traditions include processions, church services, Saint John&#x27;s bonfires, fireworks, and feasting.

== Night on Bald Mountain ==
Modest Mussorgsky&#x27;s composition &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; was originally titled &quot;St. John’s Night on the Bare Mountain,&quot; based on the story &quot;&quot; by Nikolai Gogol. The first version appeared in 1867 and was revised around 1872 and again in 1880. In this last version he added a hauntingly beautiful quiet ending; in which a church bell announces the dawn, and daybreak chases away the evil spirit. &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; is in the soundtrack of Walt Disney’s movie &quot;Fantasia&quot;.

== By country ==

=== Brazil ===

Festas Juninas (June Festivals, &quot;festivities that occur in the month of June&quot;), also known as festas de São João, are the annual Brazilian celebrations adapted from European Midsummer that take place in the southern midwinter. These festivities, which were introduced by the Portuguese during the colonial period (1500–1822), are celebrated during the month of June nationwide. The festival is mainly celebrated on the eves of the Catholic solemnities of Saint Anthony, Saint John the Baptist, and Saint Peter. In many cities in the interior of the country these festivals attract millions of tourists and have a significant impact in the local economy.

=== Canada ===

In Quebec, Canada, the celebration of St John&#x27;s Day was brought to New France by the first French colonists. Great fires were lit at night. According to the Jesuit Relations, the first celebrations of St John&#x27;s Day in New France took place around 1638 on the banks of the Saint Lawrence River on the evening of June 23, 1636 with a bonfire and five cannon shots. In 1908, Pope Pius X designated John the Baptist as the patron saint of the French-Canadians.

=== Croatia ===
Croats celebrate &quot;Ivanjske krijesove&quot;, also called &quot;Ivanjdan&quot; or &quot;Svitnjak&quot; in Western Herzegovina and coastal Croatia, is celebrated on June 23 in Croatia. People light large bonfires in honor of Saint John Baptist; the celebration can also be connected to the old Slavic traditions for Kresnik (South Slavic version of Perun) the god of Sun. The locals bring firewood to a designated place and light a bonfire at sunset; young people attempt to jump over as it burns. Rivalries between villages on who makes the bigger bonfire is common, leading to competitions between village folk.

=== Denmark ===

Saint John&#x27;s Eve (&quot;Sankthansaften&quot;) is celebrated in the same manner in Denmark as the Walpurgis Night is in Sweden. At dusk large bonfires are lit all over the country, typically accompanied by communal singing of &quot;Midsommervisen&quot; by Holger Drachmann. Atop each bonfire often an effigy of a witch is placed (harking back to the days of witch trials, when real women were burned at the stake). 
Traditionally, the bonfires were lit to fend off witches, but today - when the witch effigy catches fire - she is said to be &quot;flying away to Brocken&quot; (Danish: &quot;Bloksbjerg&quot;), which can be interpreted as helping the witch on her way. On Saint John&#x27;s Eve and Saint John&#x27;s Day, churches arrange Saint John&#x27;s services and family reunions also occur, which are an occasion for drinking and eating.

=== England ===
The feast of St. John the Baptist is one of the quarter days in England. A Christian monk of Lilleshall Abbey, in the 15th century, wrote:
The town of Midsomer Norton, in Somerset, England, is sometimes said to be named after the Feast Day of St John the Baptist, which is also the dedication of the parish church. Wynkyn de Worde (d. 1534) cooked a special soup for the occasion in the manner of his ancestors.

It was the custom in Yorkshire for every family who had come to live in the parish within the last year to put a table outside their house, on St. John&#x27;s Eve, and place on it bread and cheese and beer and offer this to anyone who passed by. Any of the parish might help themselves and, if the fortunes of the family ran to it, would be invited indoors for a further supper and a festive evening. By this means the newcomers to the parish made many acquaintances and friends, and were helped to see themselves as having a definite place in the local community.

The festival of Golowan in Penzance, Cornwall was created in 1991 to revive the celebration of the Feast of St John. Today it is marked by a torchlit procession, but in the 19th century and earlier the town was the scene of bonfires, burning tar barrels, and homemade fireworks on the principal streets.

=== Estonia ===

Estonians celebrate the eve of the St John (June 23) with bonfires. On the islands of Saaremaa and Hiiumaa, old fishing boats may be burnt in the large pyres set ablaze. Young lovers wander through the forest looking for a lucky fern flower that is said to bloom on only this night. Estonians all around the country will gather with their families, or at larger events to celebrate with singing and dancing. The celebrations carry on usually through the night, they are the largest and most important of the year, and the traditions are almost identical to Finland and similar to neighbours Latvia and Sweden.

In France, the &quot;Fête de la Saint-Jean&quot; (feast of St John), traditionally celebrated with bonfires (le feu de la Saint-Jean) that are reminiscent of Midsummer&#x27;s pagan rituals, is a Catholic festivity in celebration of Saint John the Baptist. It takes place on June 24, (St John&#x27;s day). Nowadays it is seldom celebrated. In certain French towns, a tall bonfire is built by the inhabitants in order to be lit on St John&#x27;s Day. In the Vosges region and in the Southern part of Meurthe-et-Moselle, this huge bonfire is named &quot;chavande&quot;.

=== Germany ===
Germany sees a number of Midsummernight festivals around &quot;Johannistag&quot; (St. John&#x27;s Day, 24 June).

=== Greece ===
The eve of St John&#x27;s feast, a time rich in tradition and folklore, is celebrated with a variety of customs that include leaping over bonfires, engaging in the Klidonas divination ritual for love and marriage, and the early morning harvest of wild oregano. St John is revered under several epithets, notably &quot;Riganas&quot; (the oregano bearer) and &quot;Lampadiaris&quot; (the bonfire bearer), which reflect these customs. While the tradition of lighting bonfires was prevalent up until the 1970s, it has since seen a resurgence only as a cultural performance, preserving the rich heritage of this celebration.

Giorgios Seferis&#x27;s poem &quot;Fires of St John&quot; vividly captures the essence of this event, portraying the ignition of bonfires and the enduring belief among young women that they could discover their future husbands during these festivities. This blend of ritual, belief, and cultural practice underscores the enduring significance of St John&#x27;s eve in the tapestry of local traditions.

=== Hungary ===
On June 21 Hungarians celebrate &quot;Saint Ivan&#x27;s Night&quot; (Szentiván-éj) (derived from the Slavic form of John, translated as Jovános, Ivános, Iván in Hungarian). The whole month of June was once called Month of St. Ivan until the 19th century. Setting fires is a folklore tradition this night. Girls jumped over it, while boys watched the spectacle. Most significant among the customs of the summer is lighting the fire of Midsummer Night (szentiváni tűzgyújtás) on the day of St. John (June 24), when the sun follows the highest course, when the nights are the shortest and the days the longest. In the Middle Ages it was primarily an ecclesiastical festivity, but from the 16th century on the sources recall it as a folk custom. 

=== Ireland ===
In some rural parts of Ireland, particularly in the north-west, Bonfire Night is held on St. John&#x27;s Eve (), when bonfires are lit on hilltops. The celebration is also called a &quot;Tine Cnámh&quot;, literally Bone Fire. Often lit by the oldest present, the youngest present would throw in a bone as part of the celebrations. As part of some customs after the dancing and celebrations were over, revellers would bring home a spent ember from the fire, this was thrown into a field to bring good fortune in the year to come.

In his poem &quot;The Sisters,&quot; published in 1861, Limerick poet Aubrey Thomas de Vere describes &quot;Bonfire Night&quot; or &quot;St. John&#x27;s Day Eve&quot; in a post-Great-Famine world that still lay in ruins:

Irish St. John&#x27;s Day Eve traditions included: A few days before, children and youth would solicit donations for the bonfires – it was considered bad luck to refuse them. The point of the bonfires was to draw God&#x27;s blessings on the summer crops. Attendees would leap over the bonfires. Bonfire ashes would be scattered on the crops for good luck. Most troublesome local weeds would be burned in the bonfire to help stave them off. Men would walk through their fields with lit torches and then toss those torches on the bonfire for crop blessing.

People gathering at the bonfires would bring food and drink, with potatoes roasted around the fire. Cattle would be driven through the ashes of the bonfires. At this time of year, St John&#x27;s Wort and foxgloves would be gathered; the wort was believed to ward off witchcraft and both were used medicinally.

In coastal areas of Ireland, fishermen&#x27;s boats and nets would be blessed by priests on St John&#x27;s Eve. A communal salmon dinner was traditionally served on this day in Portballintrae, County Antrim. The sweet milky dish goody was also served, which sometimes would be prepared at the bonfire in a large pot to be served to younger people.

Ballaghkeen, a village in County Wexford, where the church is dedicated to St John the Baptist, holds its Patron day on the first Sunday in July, this Sunday being the closest to the Old Calendar date for St John&#x27;s Day. In some parts of Ireland, bonfires were lit on the Eve of Saints Peter and Paul (June 28) instead of St John&#x27;s Eve. The tradition was known as &quot;Little St John’s Day&quot;.

=== Italy ===
The feast of Saint John the Baptist has been celebrated in Florence from medieval times, with festivals sometimes lasting three days from 21 to 24 June. In medieval Florence, St John&#x27;s Day was &quot;an occasion for dramatic representations of the Baptist&#x27;s life and death&quot; and &quot;the feast day was marked by processions, banquets, and plays, culminating in a fireworks show that the entire city attended.&quot;

Such celebrations are held nowadays in Cesena from 21 to 24 June also with a special street market. Saint John the Baptist is the patron saint of Genoa, Florence and Turin where a fireworks display takes place during the celebration on the river. In Turin Saint John&#x27;s cult is also well-established since medieval times when the city stops work for two days and people from the surrounding areas gather to dance around the bonfire in the central square. In Genoa and coastal Liguria it is traditional to light bonfires on the beaches on Saint John&#x27;s Eve to remember the fires lit to celebrate the arrival of Saint John&#x27;s relics to Genoa in 1098. Since 1391 on the 24th of June a great procession across Genoa carries the relics to the harbour, where the Archbishop blesses the city, the sea, and those who work on it.

=== Jersey ===
In Jersey most of the former midsummer customs are largely ignored nowadays. The custom known as Les cônes d&#x27;la Saint Jean was observed as late as the 1970s - horns or conch shells were blown. Ringing the bachîn (a large brass preserving pan) at midsummer to frighten away evil spirits survived as a custom on some farms until the 1940s and has been revived as a folk performance in the 21st century.

=== Latvia ===
=== Lithuania ===
=== Norway ===

In Norway, as elsewhere in Scandinavian countries, this event is celebrated with a communal bonfire. The event is also known as &quot;Jonsok&quot;, meaning &quot;wake of Saint John&quot;.

=== Paraguay ===
The religious festival of San Juan, on June 24, begins the night of the vigil (June 23), with music, songs, dances and games around a large bonfire. An essential element of the festival is fire, an extremely important element for the Guarani culture related to wisdom. Neighbors gather to participate in games and contests that often have traditional Guarani names. The most dangerous of the games is &quot;pelota tata&quot; a rag ball soaked in oil or kerosene. The ball ignites and turns into a ball of fire that circulates among the crowd and is kicked by people to try to scare it away. The &quot;tatá ári jehasa&quot; is also dangerous: It means walking barefoot on a meter bed of coals.

They also play &quot;toro candil&quot;, where someone wears a helmet in the shape of a bull&#x27;s head with flaming horns and runs among the crowd pretending to be a bull. The &quot;yvyra sy&#x27;ĩ&quot; (&quot;Spanish&quot; &quot;árbol resvaloso&quot; &quot;English&quot; &quot;resplendent tree&quot;) is the contest of trying to climb a greased mast, which has some prize hanging from the tip. The &quot;Casamiento Koyguá&quot; (Koyguá Marriage) is a simulated peasant wedding for fun, there is another version that would be the &quot;Casamiento Forzado&quot; (Forced Marriage) where a woman and a man are accused and forced to marry with all the details of a wedding. The &quot;kambuchi jejoká&quot; is a piñata made with a ceramic jar, which has to be broken with a wooden stick while the participant is blindfolded. The festival ends when &quot;el Judas Kai&quot; is lit, a life-size doll filled with explosives and fireworks. Many time it&#x27;s made to look like a hated or unpopular person in the community.

=== Philippines ===

In the Philippines, the festival is a thanksgiving celebration done through the traditional “basaan” (dousing of water among children and grown-ups) on the streets as a way of sharing Saint John&#x27;s blessings. Parades, street dance competitions and other activities liven up the annual celebration.

=== Poland ===

Conventional Polish celebrations of midsummer are a mix of pagan and Christian influences. In Poland the festival is known as &#x27;noc świętojańska&#x27; (Christian) or &#x27;Noc Kupały&#x27; (Kupala Night) and &#x27;sobótka&#x27; (pagan). Traditional folk rituals include groups of young men and women singing ritual songs to each other. The young women may wear crowns fashioned from wild flowers, which are later thrown into a nearby pond or lake. The boys/young men may then swim out to claim one of the crowns. Bonfires (and bonfire jumping) are also part of the proceedings.

=== Portugal ===
There are St John&#x27;s street parties in many cities, towns and villages, mainly between the evening on the 23rd and the actual St.John&#x27;s Day on the 24th of June. St John&#x27;s night in Porto (Festa de São João do Porto) has been described as &quot;one of Europe&#x27;s liveliest street festivals, yet it is relatively unknown outside&quot; Portugal. The actual Midsummer, St John&#x27;s day, is celebrated traditionally more in Porto, Braga, and in the Azores, where it is known as Sanjoaninas and celebrated from the 21st to the 30th of June.

=== Puerto Rico ===
A night-long celebration called &quot;Noche de San Juan&quot; is held in Puerto Rico, which was originally named by Christopher Columbus in 1493 as &quot;San Juan Bautista (Saint John the Baptist)&quot; in honor of the saint. After sunset, Puerto Ricans travel to a beach or any accessible body of water (e.g. river, lake or even bathtub) and, at midnight, plunge backwards into it three, seven, or twelve times. This is done to cleanse the body from bad luck and to gain good luck for the following year. It is also customary to stroll the historic district of Old San Juan in the island&#x27;s capital city, which still bears the name of the saint.

=== Shetland Isles ===
The Johnsmas Foy festivities in the Shetland Isles, where the people are still proud of their Nordic roots also take place in the week building up to the 23/24 June. Lerwick holds a Midsummer carnival.

=== Spain ===
The traditional midsummer party in Spain is the celebration in honour of Saint John (, , ) and takes place on the evening of June 23. This midsummer tradition is especially strong in coastal areas of Spain, like in Galicia, where San Xoán festivals take place all over the region; bonfires are lit and a set of firework displays usually takes place. On the Mediterranean coast, especially in Catalonia and the Valencian Community, the celebration includes bonfires too, along very popular dance parties (&quot;verbenas&quot;), and there are also traditional special foods for the day, such as Coca de Sant Joan.

There is also a large festival in Ciutadella, Menorca, along with many other different cities and towns all across Spain having their own unique traditions associated with the date. In the city of Alicante, the Bonfires of Saint John are the most important local festival, and take place from 20 to 24 June.

Bonfires are also used in the Basque Country to celebrate San Juan Eguna (the feast of St. John the Baptist), which marks the Basque Summer Solstice. In some towns the celebration is supplemented with more festivities and dances.

In Castile and León it is highlighted the Firewalking Festival of San Pedro Manrique (Soria), where barefoot men cross the live coals of a prepared bonfire.

=== Sweden ===

This holiday is normally referred to as &#x27;midsummers eve&#x27; or Midsommar in Sweden. Originally a pre-Christian tradition, the holiday has during history been influenced by Christian traditions and the celebration of Saint John, but not as much as to it changing name, as in neighbouring Norway and Denmark. A central symbol nowadays is the &#x27;midsummer pole&#x27;, a maypole that is risen on the same day as midsummers eve. The pole is a high wooden pole covered in leaves and flowers. Participants dance around the pole and sing songs. Other traditions include eating pickled herring with fresh potatoes, often the first from the seasons harvest, served with sourcream and chives, and often accompanied by drinking snaps. It is the biggest holiday of the year in Sweden besides Christmas, and with Sweden being a part of the vodka-belt, getting drunk and feasting all the whole day and night is common.

One Swedish midsummer tradition is that girls should pick seven flowers from seven different fields. The flowers should then be put under the pillow during the midsummer eve night. This night is supposedly magic and the girl is then while sleeping supposed to dream of her future husband.

Another tradition common in Sweden is to make midsummer wreaths of flowers.

=== United States ===
Historically, this date has been venerated in the practice of Louisiana Voodoo. The famous Voodoo priestess Marie Laveau was said to have held ceremonies on the Bayou St. John, in New Orleans, commemorating St John&#x27;s Eve. Many New Orleans residents still keep the tradition alive.

<text>Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Utopia (1996) is a science fiction novel by American writer Roger MacBride Allen, set in Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; universe.

==Plot summary==
Utopia takes place five years into the reign of Alvar Kresh as the governor of Inferno, who is now married to roboticist Fredda Leving. The re-terraforming effort is doing fairly well, but many believe it is still doomed to failure. The plot centers around a plan created by an Infernal named Davlo Lentrall to use a comet, named comet Grieg after the old governor, to dig a channel creating a northern sea.

Norlan Fiyle, who has been working as an intelligence broker, found out about this plan early and informed the Settlers, the Ironheads, and the New Law robots of the plan. The issue is complicated by the fact that the plan calls for the comet to land essentially on top of the new law robot city of Valhalla.

Tonya Welton, the leader of the settlers on Inferno, is upset by this plan having seen similar plans fail in the past. She orders her security people to grab Davlo and destroy his work. Although they were successful in destroying his data, the attempt to capture Davlo himself failed due to quick thinking on the part of Commander Justen Devray, now the head of the Combined Inferno Police, and the help of Davlo&#x27;s robot Kaelor.

Unfortunately, the location of comet Grieg is lost. Davlo and Fredda Leving attempt to extract this information from Kaelor&#x27;s memory, but he ends up killing himself rather than release the information which might cause harm to humans. Davlo&#x27;s guilt over the death of his robot eventually leads him to oppose the comet plan altogether. Eventually the information is retrieved when Jadelo Gildern, who had previously stolen the data from Davlo&#x27;s office, provides Governor Kresh with the missing data.

While trying to decide whether to implement the comet plan, Kresh pays a visit to the terraforming control system. The system consists of a robotic unit, called Unit Dee, working with a non-sentient Settler unit, Unit Dum, they are collectively referred to as the Twins. We learn that in order to avoid First Law conflicts, Unit Dee is being lied to and told that the entire terraforming project is really an elaborate simulation and that no actual human beings are involved. Significant care must be taken to ensure that Dee does not learn the truth. Dee confirms that Davlo&#x27;s plan, if successful, stands a good chance of repairing Inferno&#x27;s ecology. The comet project is given the go-ahead and work commences to evacuate the areas near the impact site.

As the impact approaches, Simcor Beddle and Jadelo Gildern develop a plan to use a burrowing bomb, normally used for geological surveys, to destroy Valhalla before the new law robots have time to finish evacuating. On the way there though, Simcor&#x27;s aircar is attacked, his robots killed, and a demand, to stop the comet and deliver money into a bank account or Beddle will die, is written on the door.

Kresh&#x27;s robot Donald, who heard of this incident, is forced by the First Law to act. He contacts robots in the area, who begin performing a search, and tells Dee that she is being lied to about the simulation. This causes Dee to shut down, leaving the people on the ground with few options for the final steering of the comet.

Meanwhile, Devray tries to find Beddle. He tries putting money in the account mentioned in the demand and finds that it is automatically transferred to one of Gildern&#x27;s accounts. Devray brings in Gildern, and also questions Fiyle, from whom he learns about Beddle&#x27;s plan to destroy the New Law robots. Caliban turns himself in preemptively. The three talk while in jail, and Caliban manages to deduce what has happened to Beddle and rushes off to save him. While flying there, Caliban sends out a hyperwave message to tell the other robots that are searching to go back and that the situation is under control. Caliban goes to Valhalla, where he finds several New Law robots dead and Prospero holding Beddle prisoner, with a setup where if Beddle tries to leave, he will set off the bomb. Prospero was attempting to kill Beddle while avoiding the New First Law. Caliban is left with a choice of whom to let live, and kills Prospero, saving Beddle shortly before the comet hits.

In the meantime, Dee finally wakes up and asks to talk to Kresh. She verifies that she was in fact being lied to. She asks Kresh if he believes Caliban&#x27;s message about saving Beddle. When Kresh says that he does believe it, Dee decides that she can manage the comet without First Law conflict.

<text>Reek Sunday (), Garland Sunday or [[Crom Dubh]] Sunday (Irish: &quot;Domhnach Crom Dubh&quot;) is an annual day of pilgrimage in Ireland. 

On the last Sunday in July, thousands of pilgrims climb Ireland&#x27;s holiest mountain, Croagh Patrick (764 metres) in County Mayo. It is held in honour of Saint Patrick who is said to have spent forty days fasting on the mountain in the 5th century. Masses are held at the summit, where there is a small chapel. Some climb the mountain barefoot, as an act of penance, and some carry out &#x27;rounding rituals&#x27;, which were formerly a key part of the pilgrimage. This involves praying while walking sunwise around features on the mountain: seven times around the cairn of Leacht Benáin (Benan&#x27;s grave), fifteen times around the circular perimeter of the summit, seven times around Leaba Phádraig (Patrick&#x27;s bed), and then seven times around three ancient burial cairns known as Reilig Mhuire (Mary&#x27;s cemetery). Until 1970, it was traditional for pilgrims to climb the mountain after sunset.

The pilgrimage has been held yearly for at least 1,500 years. It is likely that it pre-dates Christianity and was originally a ritual associated with the festival of Lughnasadh. 

The earliest surviving mention of a pilgrimage at Croagh Patrick is from the year 1113, when the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; record that &quot;a ball of fire came on the night of the feast of Patrick on Cruacháin Aighle [Croagh Patrick] and destroyed thirty of those fasting&quot;. Historically, pilgrimages were made to the mountaintop on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, the Feast of the Assumption, and the last Friday in July (Crom Dubh&#x27;s Friday).

Today, most pilgrims climb Croagh Patrick from the direction of Murrisk Abbey to the north. Originally, most pilgrims climbed the mountain from the east, following the Togher Patrick (&quot;Tochár Phádraig&quot;) pilgrim path from Ballintubber Abbey. This route is dotted with prehistoric monuments. The &quot;Tochár Phádraig&quot; may have originally been the main route to the mountain from Cruachan, seat of the Kings of Connacht. The &quot;Tochar Phadraig&quot; was revived and reopened by Pilgrim Paths of Ireland.

Between 15,000 and 30,000 pilgrims participate, compared to a yearly climbing total of more than 100,000. The Archbishop of Tuam leads the climb each year. Up to 300 personnel from eleven mountain rescue teams from across Ireland are involved, including the local Mayo Mountain Rescue Team, for whom it is the busiest day of the year. Also involved is the Air Corps, Irish Cave Rescue Organisation (ICRO) the Order of Malta, Civil Defence Ireland and members of the Garda Síochána. Injuries ranging from cuts and broken bones to hypothermia and cardiac arrest occur each year. The climb takes two hours, on average, and one and a half hours to descend.

==Annual climbs==
===1999===
In 1999, 25,000 pilgrims took part in the climb in ideal conditions. Archbishop Michael Neary of Tuam spoke on the mountain of the improving quality of life which Ireland was experiencing in the late 1990s.

===2002===
Michael Neary spoke of the fear created by banking and commerce as well as by the Church and state at a meeting with pilgrims in Westport prior to the 2002 climb. Pilgrims came from Australia, Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Rain created difficult climbing conditions on the day.

===2006===
Around 20,000 people took part in 2006 during particularly bad weather of wind and rain. Archbishops Seán Brady and Michael Neary said Mass on top, with Neary appealing for kindness and goodwill to be shown to immigrant families. Twenty-three people were airlifted or stretchered off the mountain with illnesses and injuries; two of these were hospitalised. The first analytic survey was conducted when 11,000 pilgrims were interviewed. Two-thirds of them were men, one-third were women, five percent came from outside Ireland, and two percent climbed in their bare feet.

===2007===
Over 30,000 pilgrims climbed Croagh Patrick on Reek Sunday in 2007. There were some minor foot injuries, whilst one man had a suspected cardiac arrest on the mountain.

===2008===
Over 25,000 pilgrims took part in 2008. The Mass on the summit, celebrated by Michael Neary, was broadcast live worldwide for the first time by RTÉ. He spoke of consumer values that he felt were seducing society. Over 20 priests were involved in the event. Injuries were very few.

===2009===
Only 18,000 pilgrims climbed the mountain in 2009. Weather conditions were particularly bad with many choosing to climb the mountain the previous day. Between five and six children contracted hypothermia. Some participants sustained minor cuts, others complained of coronary problems, whilst one woman was airlifted off the mountain after breaking her ankle the day before, and a man was airlifted to hospital after having a suspected cardiac arrest on the mountain. Prior to the climb, Mayo Mountain Rescue Team advised pilgrims to carry some sort of footwear but not flip-flops, sandals, stiletto heels or wellingtons; it was the first time they had issued such advice. Pilgrims were also told to use a stick for walking, wear multiple layers of clothing and to scale the mountain at a slow pace. Archbishop Michael Neary said before the 2009 climb that people were &quot;searching desperately&quot; for hope in the &quot;menacing desert&quot; of the recession. In his homily on the mountain, Neary talked of the effects the recession had on family life.

===2010===
Michael Neary led the 2010 National Pilgrimage to Croagh Patrick involving about 20,000 people. The Mayo Mountain Rescue Team, which responds to about 50 emergency calls to the mountain annually, called for safety maintenance work to be carried out in an area where the increased number of climbers, all year round, has caused significant erosion.

===2013===
The climb on 28 July 2013 took place in sunny weather and was undertaken by between 15,000 and 20,000 people. Ash and blackthorn sticks were for sale at €3 each, or for rent at €1.50. Drought conditions during July made it unusually dry underfoot on the day of the climb. Nearly 300 volunteers with Mayo Mountain Rescue, the Irish Cave Rescue Organisation, the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps, Civil Defence Ireland, and an Air Corps helicopter were in attendance and on standby. There were 17 reported injuries, including two which required airlifts. A woman who suffered a head injury on the peak was treated by Mayo Mountain Rescue and a 67-year-old tourist who suffered suspected cardiac problems mid-descent was treated by Order of Malta Ambulance Rescue and First aid teams, before being winched into a helicopter by Irish Air Corps and transported to hospital. The weather for the day was very good, with winds being very mild in comparison to other years.

===2015===
The climb on 26 July 2015 was cancelled. Met Éireann issued a yellow weather alert for the day until 3 pm forecasting heavy rain. Hundreds ignored that warning and traversed up the peak regardless. Locally it was estimated to be as many as 10,000 attempted.

Many are believed to have been forced to turn back and Mayo Mountain Rescue Team confirmed to TheJournal.ie that ten people have been treated for hypothermia.

===2016===
Twenty to twenty five thousand people participated in the 2016 Reek Sunday pilgrimage, which was led by the Archbishop of Tuam, Dr Michael Neary, with the Papal Nuncio, Archbishop Charles John Brown. Volunteers from all twelve Irish mountain rescue teams, including 120 members of the Order of Malta, were present as part of a safety plan coordinated by members of the Mayo Mountain Rescue team. A detachment from the Air Corps was on duty with a helicopter to rescue any casualties from the mountain.

=== 2017 ===
At least 25,000 people took part in the 2017 Reek Sunday pilgrimage. One of the first to climb the mountain, beginning the climb at 7 am, was the Archbishop of Tuam, Dr Michael Neary, accompanied by Bishop Fintan Monahan, Bishop of Killaloe, and Gearóid Dullea, executive secretary of the Irish Catholic Bishops Conference. Archbishop Neary celebrated Mass in the mountaintop oratory at 11 am. Thirteen people were injured, three of whom were airlifted off the mountain.

=== 2018 ===
An estimated 5,000 people took part in the 2018 Reek Sunday. Archbishop of Tuam Michael Neary led the pilgrimage up the mountain. Hourly masses were also celebrated at the summit. Mayo Mountain Rescue Team organised and co-ordinated rescue and emergency care services. Good weather conditions kept casualties to a minimum, although one 46-year-old man had to be airlifted to hospital in Galway with chest pains.

=== 2019 ===
Thousands of people have taken part in the 2019 pilgrimage on Croagh Patrick. Rescue teams assisting just over 20 people for mostly minor injuries. Misty weather at the summit early in the day gave way to clear conditions as the afternoon progressed. The Archbishop of Tuam, Dr Michael Neary celebrated mass on the summit in the morning. Afterwards he spoke of the appeal of the climb for generations of people. Dr Neary said there was something of a parable in the manner in which people approached the day, assisting others and ensuring that those in difficulty were given support on their journey. A range of agencies spent the day on standby to assist with the treatment of those with injuries. The Irish Air Corps airlifted a small number of people from the mountain, while Order of Malta, Mountain Rescue and Civil Defence teams patrolled the route to cater for all incidents that arose.

== Pilgrimages across Ireland ==
The annual pilgrimage to Croagh Patrick parallels numerous smaller local pilgrimages across the Island of Ireland on the last Sunday of July. These pilgrimages typically involve the climbing of a local mountain, visitation to a local Holy Well, or both. The status of these pilgrimages varies across the country, with some having been continuously practiced, some having ceased, and some being revived. 

In Keash, County Sligo, during the early 20th century Garland Sunday procedures involved the visiting of the local holy well, King Cormac&#x27;s Well, before ascending Keash Hill, the local hill which houses the Caves of Kesh. This was followed by sports and the picking of bilberries. This pilgrimage is still performed however overtime practice has shifted. In the pilgrimage done today the Holy Well visited before climbing Keash Hill is now Tobernalt Holy Well.

The Máméan pass on Binn Chaonaigh, County Galway was also climbed on this day. The practice ended in the 19th century but was revived in 1979 and occurs annually. 

Until the 19th century Slieve Donard in County Down was climbed on the last Sunday of July. The earliest known date of such a pilgrimage was dated to 1645, though the practice is believed to extend even further into the past.

Slievecallan in County Clare was once visited on the last Sunday of July, known locally as &quot;Domhnach Crom Dubh&quot;. On the top of the mountain there is a lawn called &quot;Buaile na Gréine&quot; On this lawn is supposed to have stood &quot;Altóir na Gréine&quot;. Local legends say on this altar sacrifices were supposedly offered to Pagan Gods and that the practice was then Christianized.

Drung Hill, County Kerry was, until 1880, visited on Garland Sunday. This was a day of public celebration, with a cattle fair held by the hill and singing, dancing and games played at the summit followed by an evening meal. The practice of baking a cake to be cut buy the best dancers in the celebration or by an engaged couple was a distinct characteristic of this event. The Holy Well at the peak of the mountain is also believed to have had ritual significance on this date. This festival has been connected to Lughnasa.

Similar practices can be found in Knocknadobar, County Kerry. Where on the last Sunday of July, festivities such as games and singing took placer at the base of the mountain. The pilgrimage to the peak briefly ceased but was revived in 1885.

Pilgrimages were made to numerous other locations at at this time of year, such as to the peaks of Mount Brandon, and Church Mountain and to a Holy Well in Ballyfa, County Galway

<text>The Wound Man is a surgical diagram which first appeared in European medical manuscripts of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The illustration acted as an annotated table of contents to guide the reader through various injuries and diseases whose related cures could be found on the text&#x27;s nearby pages. The image first appeared in a printed book in 1491 when it was included in the Venetian &quot;Fasciculus medicinae&quot;, likely Europe&#x27;s first printed medical miscellany. Thereafter it circulated widely in printed books until well into the seventeenth century. The Wound Man has since become a recognisable figure in popular culture.

==Description==
The Wound Man illustrates various injuries that a person might receive through war, accident, or disease: cuts and bruises from multiple weapons, rashes and pustules, thorn scratches, and the bites of venomous animals. The figure also includes some schematic anatomical outlines of several organs within his unusual, transparent abdomen. 
In earlier manuscript versions, the figure is surrounded by numbers and phrases which indicate where in the accompanying treatise a healer might find a particular helpful procedure. For instance, in a German Wound Man now in the Wellcome Library, London (MS 49), the spider crawling up the man&#x27;s thigh is labelled &quot;&quot;Wo eine spynne gesticht,&quot; 20&quot; (&quot;When a spider bites, 20&quot;), directing the reader to paragraph 20 of the book for an appropriate cure. Similarly, written along the large spear piercing the figure&#x27;s left side and penetrating into his stomach is the legend &quot;&quot;So der gross viscus wund wirt&quot;, 14&quot; (&quot;If the large intestine is injured, 14&quot;). Turning to the corresponding cure number 14, the reader finds:

Despite these injuries, however, the Wound Man is still depicted as standing defiantly alive. This reaffirms the fact that the figure was not intended as a threatening one: instead it explained and glorified the cures and medical treatments available in the texts that he accompanied.

==In popular culture==
The Wound Man continues to be referenced in popular culture: 

In the 1980 novel &quot;Red Dragon&quot; by Thomas Harris, it is mentioned that Will Graham was tipped off to the fact that Hannibal Lecter was a serial killer from this diagram, as Lecter killed his sixth victim in this manner. A further reference to the diagram is made by the character Clarice Starling in the sequel novel &quot;Hannibal&quot;. 
The Wound Man is also referenced in season 1, episode 6 of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Hannibal&quot; TV series in 2013, and again visually and by name in season 2, episode 7 of the same show.

The Royal College of Emergency Medicine uses a Wound Man as a supporter in its heraldic achievement.

The Wound Man from von Gersdorff&#x27;s 1519 treatise is used as the cover of &quot;The Practical&quot; by Stone Franks.

The Wound Man from von Gersdorff&#x27;s 1519 treatise is used as the weapon list for the tabletop roleplaying game Mörk Borg.

===Stories not involving the Three Laws of Robotics===
Stories that are about Asimov&#x27;s positronic robots that do not obey the Three Laws of Robotics are:

*&quot;Let&#x27;s Get Together&quot; robots are used as parts of a bomb that will explode when they get together.
*In &quot;Someday&quot; there are non-positronic computers which tell stories and do not obey the Three Laws.
*In &quot;Sally&quot; there are positronic brain cars who can damage men or disobey without problems. No other kinds of robots are seen, and there is no mention of the Three Laws.
*In &quot;. . . That Thou Art Mindful of Him&quot; robots are created with a very flexible Three Laws management, and these create little, simplified robots with no laws that actually act against the Three Laws of Robotics.

===Robot stories not included===
This collection includes most of Asimov&#x27;s robot short stories. Missing ones were either written after its publication, or formed the text connecting the stories in &quot;I, Robot&quot;.

The six Asimov robot short stories not included in this book are:
* &quot;Robot Dreams&quot; (found in the anthology of the same title)
* &quot;Robot Visions&quot; (found in the anthology of the same title)

<doc id="474743" wikidata="Q208372" url="?curid=474743" title="Malév Hungarian Airlines">
<text>MALÉV Ltd. (), which did business as MALÉV Hungarian Airlines (, abbreviated &quot;MALÉV&quot;, ), was the flag carrier of Hungary from 1946 until 2012. Its head office was in Budapest, with its main hub at Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport. The airline flew to over 50 cities in 34 countries with a fleet of 22 aircraft. Malév joined the Oneworld alliance on 29 March 2007. On 3 February 2012, Malév ceased operations and on 14 February 2012 was declared insolvent by the Metropolitan Court of Budapest.

==History==

===Beginnings===
Hungarian civil aviation was pioneered by airlines such as &quot;Aero Rt.&quot; (founded 1910), &quot;Magyar Aeroforgalmi Rt.&quot; (Maefort) and &quot;Magyar Légiforgalmi Rt.&quot; (MALÉRT (mɒleːrt)). The widespread devastation of World War II forced these airlines to suspend airline service in 1940–44, and they were ultimately replaced by Maszovlet as the national airline after the war. Maszovlet was founded on 29 March 1946, as the Hungarian-Soviet Civil Air Transport Joint Stock Company (&quot;Magyar-Szovjet Polgári Légiforgalmi Rt.&quot; also known as &quot;MASZOVLET&quot;), as a merger between &quot;Malert&quot;, &quot;Maefort&quot; and the Hungarian part of &quot;Aeroflot&quot;.

The initial fleet consisted of 21-seat Li-2 passenger aircraft (the Soviet-licensed DC-3) and 3-seat Po-2 &quot;taxis&quot;, used for precision air mail: sacks of mail were dropped from the aircraft when flying over its destination. In 1950, Malév&#x27;s operating base moved from Budaörs to the newly opened airport at Ferihegy, where it remained.

On 25 November 1954, Hungary acquired all the Soviet shares of MASZOVLET, and renamed the company MALÉV. Ilyushin Il-14 twin piston-engined transport aircraft were acquired in the late 1950s. Operations were expanded, with flights extending to nearby countries and, following the 1965 acquisition of Ilyushin Il-18 turbine propeller airliners, and the subsequent 1968 purchase of jet-powered Tupolev Tu-134s from the Soviet Union, across Europe and the Middle East. In the summer of 1974, the Tupolev-154 was brought into scheduled service.

Even before the political changes of 1989 and the arrival of democracy, Malév had begun phasing out its Soviet-era planes with the introduction of the airline&#x27;s first Western-designed aircraft, a Boeing 737-200 on 18 November 1988. With that, Malév was the second airline in the then-communist COMECON countries of Central Europe to operate a Western-built aircraft. (TAROM – Romanian Airlines started operating the BAC 1-11 in 1968 and the Boeing 707 in 1974. LOT – Polish Airlines was the third with its Boeing 767-300 aircraft launched in April 1989).

The company&#x27;s logo, which turned out to be its last, was designed by graphic designer László Zsótér (DLA) in 1986 and consecutively adopted during the following years.

===1990s–2007: Modernisation===
The last Soviet-built Tupolev Tu-154 aircraft was withdrawn from service in 2001. In 2003, MALÉV began replacing its Boeing 737 Classic aircraft with 737 Next-Generation planes. It then ran a fleet of 18 Boeing 737 Next Generations, as well as 4 Bombardier Dash 8 Q-400s for short-haul routes.

From 1999 to 2007, the Hungarian State Privatization Company ÁPV Plc. (Állami Privatizációs és Vagyonkezelő Rt.) owned 99.5% of Malév shares. The other 0.5% were in the hands of small shareholders. József Váradi was CEO from 1999 to 2003. He later founded Wizz Air. ÁPV Plc. repeatedly tried to privatise Malév, finally selling it to AirBridge Zrt.

===2007–2011: In private hands===
AirBridge acquired 99.9% of the airline in February 2007. It had 1,785 staff members, as of 31 December 2007.

Despite Czech Airlines&#x27; offer to sponsor Malév as an associate member of the SkyTeam alliance, and MALÉV&#x27;s codeshare agreements with several SkyTeam carriers, Malév joined Oneworld on 29 March 2007.

On 12 July 2007, Lloyd Paxton was appointed CEO of MALÉV. Paxton replaced János Gönci, who remained on the board of directors as an adviser. Paxton was the first MALÉV CEO to come from the airline industry. He had been with British Airways for over 35 years and more recently with Air Astana. Two months later, on 14 September 2007, Lloyd Paxton resigned as CEO of MALÉV, replaced by Péter Leonov. In January 2009, Ballo Anatoly Borisovich became the chairman.

On 18 March 2009, the Russian state-owned Vnesheconombank took a 49% minority stake in AirBridge Zrt., the shareholder of the struggling airline, and gave managing control to Russian flag carrier Aeroflot. The Hungarian government retained 51% majority ownership. Martin Gauss, former CEO of DBA and Cirrus Airlines as well as a Boeing 737 pilot was elected CEO on 15 April 2009. During the management of Martin Gauss, MALÉV reached a load factor above industry average among &quot;traditional&quot; airlines, comparable to that of low-cost airlines. One of the reasons of the departure of Martin Gauss as CEO of MALÉV was the benefit ceiling established by the newly elected government, led by Viktor Orbán, in 2010, where a ceiling of €8000 gross monthly salary (approx €5000 net) was set for all managers, governing state-owned companies.

In 2009, Malév became the second airline outside of the former Soviet Unionafter the Italian ItAli Airlinesto order the Russian Sukhoi Superjet 100, when it signed a letter of intent for 15 planes with an option for 15 more. News organizations speculated that the deal was influenced by minority owner Vneshekonombank and partner airline Aeroflot. The order was suspended in 2011, one year before Malév ceased operations.

The airline was renationalised in February 2010, with Hungarian state holding company MNV acquiring a 95% stake in the airline. The remaining 5% remained with AirBridge. In December 2010, the European Commission began an investigation into illegal government subsidies of Malév.

===2012: Financial collapse and cessation of operations===
On 9 January 2012, the European Union considered the state aid received by MALÉV illegal and ordered Hungary to recover it from the company. The European Commission ordered MALÉV to repay various forms of state aid received from 2007 to 2010, totalling 38 billion forints (€130 m; $171 m), a sum equal to its entire 2010 revenue. At the end of January 2012, MALÉV announced that it could no longer fund its own operations, and requested more subsidies from the Hungarian government. After having two planes seized at foreign airports by creditors, MALÉV immediately ceased all flight activity on 3 February 2012, after 66 years of continuous operation. The airline&#x27;s total debts were 60 billion forints (US$270.5 million) at the time of shutdown. The shutdown occurred at 6 am Western European Time on 3 February 2012. On 14 February 2012, the Metropolitan Court of Budapest declared MALÉV Ltd. insolvent. Hitelintézeti Felszámoló Nonprofit Kft. (Credit Institutional Liquidator Nonprofit Ltd.) received the appointment as the liquidator of MALÉV Ltd.

==Corporate affairs==
===Business figures===
Before its closure, the airline had 2,600 employees and almost half of the air traffic at Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport. In 2011 about 40% of the revenues at Budapest airport originated from Malév operations, and during that year the airline served 3.2 million passengers.

===Head office===

MALÉV&#x27;s head office was located inside the Lurdy House (&quot;Lurdy Ház&quot;) in Budapest., an office and shopping complex that opened in 1998. Previously the airline head office was located elsewhere in Budapest. In the 1960s and 1970s it was in &quot;Vörösmarty tér 5. (District V)&quot;, and in the 1990s it was in &quot;Roosevelt tér 2&quot;. The airline signed a lease agreement in the spring of 2011 with Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport agreeing to relocate its headquarters to three office buildings between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 in the airport by the summer of 2012, but these plans were cancelled due to the shutdown.

===Ownership===
The airline was privatised in the 1990s. In December 1993, ÁPV Plc. sold 40,316 &quot;A&quot; series shares to the airline&#x27;s employees. In 1998 ÁPV Plc. held 64.089% of the company (4,929,954 shares), Alitalia-Linee Aeree Italiane held 30% (2,307,693 shares), Simest held 5% (384,615 shares), private entities held 0.333% (25,577 shares), and several local governments held the rest of the company. Local governments with stakes in Malév were Agárd, Balatonlelle, Budapest, Debrecen, Budapest District 5, and Budapest District 18.

In 2007 the Russian brothers Alexander and Boris Abramovich acquired 49% of AirBridge Zrt as part of a privatisation program of the Hungarian government. After the AiRUnion alliance of the Abramovich brothers went bankrupt in 2009, Vnesheconombank took over the Abramovich stake.

The government of Hungary re-nationalized the airline on 26 February 2010, after Malev experienced changes in ownership and financial difficulties. The government held 95% of the airline while AirBridge Zrt held 5%. AirBridge Zrt was 51% owned by Kálmán Kiss and Magdolna Költő, two Hungarian individuals (very likely straw owners), and 49% owned by Boris Abramovich. Prior to 26 February 2010, AirBridge Zrt held 99.95% of Malév and minor shareholders held 0.05%.

==Destinations==

MALÉV Hungarian Airlines offered scheduled services to about fifty destinations in Europe and the Middle East; charter flights were also flown. Flights to Africa, East Asia, and North America had been terminated. Services on the Budapest-Toronto and Budapest-New York-JFK routes were suspended in mid-November 2007. Then, on 23 July 2008, MALÉV announced the cancellation of the New York and Toronto flights; these had been operated since the early 1990s.

===Codeshare agreements===
Malév Hungarian Airlines had codeshare agreements with the following airlines, beside oneworld members:

===Retired fleet===
Over the years, Malév had in the past operated a variety of aircraft, including:

==Incidents and accidents==
; 23 December 1954: Lisunov Li-2P HA-LIF force-landed near Polná, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic) due to icing; while landing, the left landing gear collapsed; all 33 on board survived (one person was injured), but the aircraft was written off. On the same day Li-2P HA-LII belly-landed near Bratroňov, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic) due to icing; all 19 on board survived, but the aircraft was also written off.
; 13 July 1956: Flight 622, a Lisunov Li-2T (HA-LIG), was hijacked by seven people who demanded to be taken to West Germany; the aircraft landed safely at Ingolstadt Air Base with no casualties to the 20 passengers and crew on board.
; 13 October 1956: Lisunov Li-2P HA-LID was hijacked shortly after takeoff from Szombathely Airport by four armed men who wanted to be flown to the West; of the 19 on board, one died and two were injured.
; 9 June 1957: Li-2P HA-LIM stalled and crashed short of the runway at Ferihegy Airport while attempting to return following engine failure; no casualties.
; 6 August 1961: Douglas TS-62 HA-TSA crashed in a residential area in Budapest while on a sightseeing flight due to crew negligence and loss of control, killing all 27 on board and another three on the ground.
; 23 November 1962: Flight 355, an Ilyushin Il-18V (HA-MOD), crashed at Le Bourget Airport, probably as the result of a stall; all 21 on board died.
; 17 February 1964: VEB 14P HA-MAH was burnt out in a hangar fire at Ferihegy Airport.
; 19 November 1969: Tupolev Tu-134 HA-LBA overran the runway on landing at Atatürk Airport, collapsing the landing gear and injuring the navigator (in the nose); there were no other casualties, but the aircraft was written off.
; 28 August 1971: Flight 731, an Ilyushin Il-18V (HA-MOC), crashed into the sea on approach to Copenhagen Airport, killing 32; 2 survived. Dezső Szentgyörgyi, who was piloting the Il-18V at the time of the crash and also the top-scoring Hungarian ace of World War II, was among those who were killed.
; 16 September 1971:Flight 110, operated by Tupolev Tu-134 HA-LBD, crashed near Boryspil International Airport, Kiev in bad weather, following two missed approaches, after a generator failure caused the crew to switch to batteries; all 49 on board died.
; 15 January 1975: MALÉV Flight 801, a Ilyushin Il-18V (HA-MOH), was being ferried from East Berlin to Budapest when it crashed on approach to Ferihegy Airport due to weather, poor visibility, poor CRM and possible spatial disorientation, killing the nine crew.
; 30 September 1975: Malév Flight 240, a Tupolev Tu-154, crashed in the Mediterranean Sea off Lebanon for reasons unknown, killing all 60 on board.
; 21 September 1977: Flight 203, a Tupolev Tu-134 (HA-LBC), flying from Istanbul to Budapest with an intermediate stop at Bucharest struck level ground on approach, probably as a result of flying at reduced power, unnoticed by the crew. Of the 53 on board, 29 died.
; 29 March 1989: Two teenagers from Czechoslovakia armed with grenades and shotguns hijacked Flight 640 at Prague Ruzyně Airport, and flew the Tupolev Tu-154B with 15 hostages to Frankfurt Airport before surrendering.
; 4 July 2000: Flight 262, a chartered Tupolev Tu-154 (HA-LCR), landed on its belly at Thessaloniki Airport in Greece. The crew had not successfully lowered the landing gear and the aircraft skidded on the runway. The aircraft was able to become airborne again as the pilots applied full throttle. It circled until the crew managed to lower the landing gear and landed safely. There were no injuries, but the aircraft was written off, and was used for fire training until 2018, after which it was scrapped.

<text>EconMult is a general fleet model to be used in fisheries modelling. EconMult has been developed since 1991 as a part of the Multispecies management programme by the Norwegian Research Council at the Norwegian College of Fishery Science (University of Tromsø, Norway).

==Model resolution and key variables==
EconMult is a discrete time simulation model where the fleet activity is controlled by two variables: &quot;Number of vessels (v)&quot; (within each fleet segment) and &quot;Number of fishing days d)&quot; (within each time interval). &quot;The biomass units&quot; (x) are exogenous variables. The model resolution is determined by four structural variables: &quot;Number of fleet groups j)&quot;, &quot;Number of targeted species n)&quot;, &quot;Number of biomass units i)&quot; (which may be more than one within each targeted species) and &quot;Period length&quot; (time step in the simulation). The number of vessels and fishing days therefore are presented in fleet (columns)-targeted species (rows) matrices, while the biomass units is presented in a column vector (X):

==Catch production==
A &quot;fishery&quot; is in EconMult defined as a unique fleet/targeted species combination. The total catch within each fishery may include all biomass units defined in the model. Each biomass unit vessel catch is computed by Cobb–Douglas production function, applying two input variables: &quot;number of fishing days d)&quot; and &quot;biomass unit x)&quot;. In the matrix below each column represents a fleet group and each row a targeted species so each element in the matrix is a fishery and gives the vessel catch of the biomass units represented. The biomass units represent all the targeted species. Each catch is represented a Cobb–Douglas production equation as shown in the vessel yield matrix (Y):

formula_1

The corresponding fleet catches are

formula_2

&quot;α&quot; &quot;β&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are parameters, the first two known as output elasticities of effort and biomass respectively, &quot;q&quot; is often referred to as &quot;the catchability coefficient&quot;. All the three parameters have the same dimension as the matrix above, e.g. the catchability coefficient:

<doc id="474749" wikidata="Q6663209" url="?curid=474749" title="Lo Wu">
<text>Lo Wu () is an area in North District, New Territories, Hong Kong. It lies on the border between Hong Kong and mainland China, specifically the Luohu District of Shenzhen in mainland China. The area is most notable as the location of the most heavily used immigration control point for passengers travelling to and from mainland China. It is where the Lo Wu station is located.
==History==

Lo Wu () was known as (Lo Wu, shell lake) in Cantonese. (lo) and (lo) are two characters with same consonant and vowel but of different tones.

Lo Wu was mentioned in the list of withdrawn villages during Qing era against remaining resistance of former Ming.

At the time of the 1911 census, the population of Lo Wu was 8.

==Location==

Lo Wu is located at junction of Sheung Yue River and Sham Chun River. East of Lo Wu is a hill named Sandy Ridge, known as Sha Ling to locals, which is one of the major cemeteries located in Hong Kong. The entire Lo Wu area was divided in 1898 by the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory.

For many years, a British Army camp had lain at the base of Crest Hill, so called because a regimental badge had been carved into its slopes. Latterly, Royal Artillery survey units occupied the largely tented camp below the hill, with duties including observation into the People&#x27;s Republic from the outlook post on topping Crest Hill. In February 1950, during a period of assaults on the mainland from Formosa, an aircraft of the Koumingtang flew illegally over Hong Kong to bomb the railway to Guangzhou beyond Lo Wu.

Between 1898 and 1949, there was no border patrol in the area, and as a result, people were free to travel between Hong Kong and China. In 1952, in an effort to combat illegal immigration and smuggling, the Hong Kong Government established the Frontier Closed Area, which included the Lo Wu area.

The border crossing facility is only accessible by the Lo Wu station of the East Rail line. For those who are not residents within the Frontier Closed Area, and are not crossing the border, a Closed Area Permit is required. Applications for Closed Area Permits outside the Closed Area can be made at the Sheung Shui Police station in Fanling.

== MTR East Rail line Lo Wu station ==
Lo Wu station is the northern terminus of the East Rail line of Hong Kong, sitting in the southern bank of the Sham Chun River, the Frontier Closed Area on Hong Kong&#x27;s northern frontier. The station serves as a primary checkpoint for rail passengers between Hong Kong and mainland China.

==Land boundary control point==
Lo Wu Immigration Control Point () is a passenger cross border point between Hong Kong and mainland China. It operates daily from 6:30 am to midnight. During peak hours, holidays and weekends, the waiting time for entries and exits through Lo Wu is shorter than the other 3 control points because it has the largest visitors&#x27; handling capacity. Of all passenger departures (including non-residents) from Hong Kong for mainland China, 90% go through the land border control points of Lo Wu, Lok Ma Chau, Man Kam To and Sha Tau Kok, with Lo Wu accounting for 85% of total departures.

Lo Wu is the most popular border crossing for people travelling to mainland China because most people take the East Rail line, which is more convenient compared to other means of transport. By passing through Lo Wu, one can reach the busiest commercial zone of Shenzhen in the shortest period of time.

Starting from 5 July 2002, a returning Hong Kong resident aged 18 or above who has spent at least 24 hours outside Hong Kong may bring in 60 cigarettes duty-free for his own use. Starting from 1 August 2010, however, this duty-free allowance has been reduced to 19. Under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, an incoming passenger must declare dutiable cigarettes to a Customs officer and pay the duty on them.

===24-hour border crossing through Lo Wu===

In mid-December 2002, the Hong Kong government announced that the Lok Ma Chau immigration control point bordering the Huanggang Port Control Point on the Shenzhen side shall take the lead to provide round-the-clock passenger service just before Chinese New Year. Vehicles and container trucks have already been moving both ways throughout the night at this control point.

However, 24-hour border-crossing at Lo Wu control point is still undergoing vigorous debates mainly arguing about the limited number of passengers at night. In addition, higher costs and noise pollution are likely to be created. Kowloon-Canton Railway chairman Michael Tien has once said that it is absolutely impossible to run railway services round-the-clock because of the difficulties in maintenance. This new policy has both advantages and disadvantages. It is clear that trade and transportation and logistic links between mainland China and Hong Kong will flourish. However, it may also cause some social problems since it eases the way to go from Hong Kong to mainland China.

===Safety problems at the land boundary control point===

Lo Wu is within the Closed Area along the long border. Usually, only travellers wanting to pass through Lo Wu to reach Shenzhen are allowed to enter the area. Citizens wishing to enter the area for other purposes require special approval from the Hong Kong Police Force.

An incident happened in 2000, involving a boy named Yu Man-Hon (Chinese name: 庾文翰), who was mentally disabled. He was missing at the Lo Wu boundary control point. The controversy arose when the fifteen-year-old ran across the boundary control point, without any identification. In the confusion, and due to the lack of understanding by border officers on both sides, he was mistakenly released into mainland China and has not been heard from since. The officials were criticised for a lack of awareness and for failure to recognise Yu&#x27;s mental disability, letting him free to roam in an unfamiliar place. His parents are still searching for him; as the chances of finding him are diminishing, chances of finding him are unlikely.

== Developments in Lo Wu ==
Due to its strategic location as a gateway to Hong Kong and in the CBD of Shenzhen, the Luohu District has flourished with many top-grade office buildings. Nevertheless, the Lo Wu area in Hong Kong is remote from the city centre, and far from urban development. As it is lying within the Closed Area, access is restricted, development is impossible and the area has largely remained rural. Relatively cheaper prices of durable goods, gourmet dining and entertainment in the Shenzhen side has hit the retail industry of Hong Kong, particularly in Sheung Shui and Fanling in the North District.

There is change afoot. Despite the pleas of environmental groups the closed area is to be opened to &#x27;selective&#x27; development, despite its splendid isolation for the past 50 years, threatening an unduplicated abundance of local fauna and flora.

==Improvement Projects in Lo Wu==

===Sham Chun River===

In May 1995, the governments of Hong Kong and Shenzhen jointly completed the environmental impact assessment study of the Sham Chun River Stage 1 works (), which comprised the construction of two new, wider and deeper river sections of about 3.2 km long at Lok Ma Chau and Liu Pok () to replace existing river bends. The governments of Hong Kong and Shenzhen were committed to implementing a comprehensive environmental monitoring and audit programme.

=== Lo Wu Bridge ===
==Correctional institution==

Established in 1997 on the site of what in the previous decade had been a detention camp, which in its turn occupied what had since the British reoccupation of Hong Kong in 1945 been the site of a largely tented British Army camp. The camp was occupied in 1950 by the 15 Observation and 173 Locating Batteries of the Royal Artillery, housed largely in tented accommodation. The 15 Observation Battery was subsequently retitled as the 15 Locating Battery, moving to Korea with the UN forces early in 1951.

After a period of service as a detention camp for Boat People escaped from Vietnam, permanent buildings were constructed for the current minimum security institution for male adult prisoners only. With a capacity for 182 prisoners, it is situated at 163 Ho Sheung Heung Road. In response to the growing importance of the reformation of offenders, the Correctional Services Department (CSD) has set up a new division to focus on rehabilitation services for inmates since January 1998.

The new Rehabilitation Division is headed by Assistant Commissioner (Rehabilitation) and comprises about 380 staff in five units. With the establishment of the Rehabilitation Division, they strive to formulate strategies for the long-term development of rehabilitation services for inmates, to strengthen the co-ordination / connection with the relevant statutory prison sentence review boards, and other concerned bodies on rehabilitation matters of inmates, and to identify the gaps and overlaps in existing rehabilitation services for inmates.

==Lo Wu Saddle Club==

The Lo Wu Saddle Club, a horse riding establishment that is open to members as well as the general public, is situated at Ho Sheung Heung ().

The Club was formerly a camp for the British Army. There have been equines of one sort or another at Lo Wu Camp for over 30 years. The Camp was built to house over 10 British Army Mules, which were used as pack animals for forays into the hills and along the border, as well as for drills and formal parades. Originally known as the RASC the name was changed to the 81st Pack Troop of the Royal Corps of Transport.

Later, horses joined the mules and the Hong Kong Services Saddle Club (HKSSC) came into being, under the command of the Royal Army Vet Corps. The HKSSC was the first and for some time the only place in Hong Kong where riding instruction was given. All other riding establishments were strictly for leisure only. The Army was also the first to hold competitions on the fields here and at the Shek Kong Airfield.

In 1994 with the beginning of withdrawal of British troops from Hong Kong, HKSSC was on the verge of closure. In June of that year a group of keen horse lovers, determined to maintain a base for their riding activities, negotiated a lease on the Lo Wu Camp and took over the administration of what is now known as &quot;Lo Wu Saddle Club&quot;.

Themes and objectives of the Club are, among others, promotion of equestrian sport and the care of horses. These are achieved through avenues such as giving of riding instruction to all levels of riders, holding of horse shows and clinics, involvement in the Hong Kong Equestrian Federation and the Pony Club, provision of community services and establishing ties with other places (e.g. Beijing, France, Ireland and New Zealand) and with international trainers.

Today, having seen the very beginning of equestrian in Hong Kong, the Club continues to encourage appreciation of the sport.

== Education ==

There is a primary school called the Lo Wu Public School (). It was established by the local inhabitants of the village in Lo Wu Village.

<doc id="474752" wikidata="Q153026" url="?curid=474752" title="Euroregion">
<text>In European politics, the term Euroregion usually refers to a transnational co-operation structure between two (or more) contiguous territories located in different European countries. Euroregions represent a specific type of cross-border region.

==Scope==
Euroregions usually do not correspond to any legislative or governmental institution and do not have direct political power. Their work is limited to the competencies of the local and regional authorities which constitute them. They are usually arranged to promote common interests across the border and to cooperate for the common good of the border populations.

==Criteria==
The Association of European Border Regions sets the following criteria for the identification of Euroregions:

* an association of local and regional authorities on either side of the national border, sometimes with a parliamentary assembly
* a transfrontier association with a permanent secretariat and a technical and administrative team with own resources
* of private law nature, based on non-profit-making associations or foundations on either side of the border in accordance with the respective national law in force
* of public law nature, based on inter-state agreements, dealing among other things, with the participation of territorial authorities

It is difficult to associate one legal framework with the term &quot;Euroregion&quot;, as they operate across country borders and vary widely in their particular forms.

==Naming conventions==
The naming convention for Euroregions is as varied as the forms of the regions themselves. The most common local names for a Euroregion include &quot;euregio&quot;, &quot;euregion&quot;, &quot;euroregion&quot;, &quot;eurorégion&quot;, &quot;euroregión&quot;, &quot;euroregione&quot;, &quot;euro-região&quot;, , &quot;europaregion&quot;, &quot;euroregiune&quot;, &quot;grande région&quot;, (), &quot;regio&quot;, &quot;conseil&quot;, or &quot;council&quot;.

==List of Euroregions==
The cooperating regions usually have different (local) names in each participating country. The regions are listed in alphabetical order of the corresponding English names. Listed are also the particular participating countries and the year the euroregion was founded.

<doc id="474753" wikidata="Q346588" url="?curid=474753" title="Lars Porsena">
<text>Lars Porsena (or Porsenna; Etruscan: ) was an Etruscan king (lar) known for his war against the city of Rome. He ruled over the city of Clusium (Etruscan: ; modern Chiusi). There are no established dates for his rule, but Roman sources often place the war at around 508 BC.

==War against Rome==

Lars Porsena came into conflict with Rome after the revolution that overthrew the monarchy there in 509 BC, resulting in the exile of the semi-legendary last king of Rome, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. The deposed monarch, whose family was of Etruscan origin, tried and failed to retake the throne a number of times before appealing to Porsena for assistance, since at that time Clusium was said to be a very powerful Etruscan city.

At this point, however, the histories diverge. According to most mainstream Roman accounts, including Livy, Porsena attacked and besieged Rome, but was sufficiently impressed by particular acts of Roman bravery in defending the city that he chose to make peace. Other accounts, however, suggest that Porsena was at least partially successful in subduing the city. None of the accounts, however, suggests that Tarquinius Superbus was returned to the throne. Thus, if Lars Porsena did indeed capture Rome, he may have done so with the intent of controlling it himself, not restoring the former dynasty.
Accounts of the war include a number of matters directly concerning Porsena. One story tells that, during his siege of Rome, a Roman youth named Gaius Mucius sneaked into the Etruscan camp with the approval of the Senate, intent on assassinating Porsena. However, when Mucius came into the king&#x27;s presence, he could not distinguish Porsena from his secretary, who was similarly attired. Mucius was captured after stabbing the secretary. Brought before Porsena, he defiantly said that some other Roman would succeed in assassinating the king. To prove his valour, Mucius then thrust his right hand into a sacrificial fire, thereby earning for himself and his descendants the cognomen Scaevola (&quot;lefty&quot;). Astonished and impressed by the young man&#x27;s courage, Porsena gave Mucius his freedom and dismissed him from the camp. According to Livy, Porsena sought peace by treaty immediately afterward.

Another tale of the war concerns the Roman hostages taken by Porsena as part of the treaty. One of the hostages, a young woman named Cloelia, fled the Etruscan camp, leading away a group of Roman virgins. Porsena demanded that she be returned, and the Romans consented. On her return, however, Porsena was so impressed by her bravery that he asked her to choose half the remaining hostages to be freed. She selected all the youngest Roman boys. Afterwards the Romans gave Cloelia the unusual honour of a statue at the top of the Via Sacra, showing Cloelia mounted on a horse—that is, as an &quot;eques&quot;.

Livy also recounts that during his own time, public auctions of goods at Rome were by tradition referred to as &quot;selling the goods of king Porsena&quot;, and that this somehow relates to the war with Clusium. Livy concludes most likely it is because, when Porsena departed Rome, he left behind as a gift for the Romans his stores of provisions.

In 507 BC, Porsena once again sent ambassadors to the Roman senate, requesting the restoration of Tarquinius to the throne. Legates were sent back to Porsena, to advise him that the Romans would never re-admit Tarquinius, and that Porsena should out of respect for the Romans cease requesting Tarquinius&#x27; readmittance. Porsena agreed, even asking Tarquinius to continue his exile outside Clusium. Porsena also restored to the Romans their hostages, and also the lands of Veii that had been taken from Rome by treaty. Livy records that, by these matters, a faithful peace between Porsena and Rome was created.

==War with Aricia==

In 508 BC, after the siege of Rome, Porsena split his forces and sent part of the Clusian army with his son Aruns to besiege the Latin city of Aricia. The Aricians in turn sent for assistance from the Latin League and from Cumae, and the Clusian army was defeated in battle.

==Tomb==
According to most accounts, Lars Porsena was buried in an elaborate tomb in (or under) the city he ruled. Pliny the Elder describes Porsena&#x27;s tomb as having a 50 Roman foot high rectangular base with sides 300 feet long (approx. 15 x 89 m). It was adorned by pyramids and massive bells.

Porsena&#x27;s tomb would have been razed to the ground together with the rest of the city of Clusium in 89 BC by the Roman general Cornelius Sulla.

==Fictional treatment==

The story of Lars Porsenna and the Roman hostage Cloelia is the basis of the libretto (1762) by Pietro Metastasio. The French writer Madeleine de Scudéry wrote in 1661.

&quot;Lays of Ancient Rome&quot; (1842) by Thomas Babington Macaulay tells the legendary story of the Roman Horatius defending the bridge into Rome against Lars Porsena&#x27;s oncoming Etruscan army.

Robert Graves&#x27; &quot;I, Claudius&quot; (1934) features a fictional conversation between the emperor-to-be Claudius and the historians Livy and Pollio about the accuracy of Livy&#x27;s histories, specifically bringing up the questions of whether Lars Porsena took Rome, and whether the story about Scaevola is true. The Etruscan king also supplies the title of Graves&#x27; essay &quot;Lars Porsena or The Future of Swearing and Improper Language&quot; (1927).

<text>The olive-backed oriole (Oriolus sagittatus), or white-bellied oriole, is a very common medium-sized passerine bird native to northern and eastern Australia and south-central New Guinea. The most wide-ranging of the Australasian orioles, it is noisy and conspicuous.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The olive-backed oriole was originally described in the genus &quot;Coracias&quot; by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1801.

===Subspecies===
Four subspecies are recognized: 
* &quot;O. s. magnirostris&quot; - : Found in south-central New Guinea
* &quot;O. s. affinis&quot; - : Originally described as a separate species. Found in north-western and north-central Australia
* &quot;O. s. grisescens&quot; - : Found on Cape York Peninsula (north-eastern Australia) and islands of the Torres Strait
* &quot;O. s. sagittatus&quot; - : Found in eastern Australia

==Description==
Not bright in colour, it is olive-backed with small dark streaks, with a light chest having black streaks. Females have cinnamon-edged wings and both sexes have reddish bills and eyes.

==Distribution and habitat==
Where the green oriole specialises in damp, thickly vegetated habitats in the tropical far north, the olive-backed oriole is more versatile, preferring more open woodland environments, and tolerating drier climates (but not desert). While common to very common in the north, olive-backed orioles are less frequently seen in the south, but nevertheless reach as far as south-eastern South Australia. Their range is from the very north of Western Australia across the east and south coasts to Victoria and the corner of South Australia. Most birds breed during the tropical wet season, but some migrate south to breed in the southern summer.

<text>The Norwegian Institute of Marine Research () is a national consultative research institute which is owned by the Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs. The institute performs research and provides advisory services in the fields of marine ecosystems and aquaculture.

With a staff of almost 1100, the Institute of Marine Research is the largest centre of marine research in Norway, and among the largest in Europe. The institute has a highly qualified scientific staff, high-technology research stations and laboratories in Austevoll, Bergen (head office), Flødevigen (Arendal) and Matre, a department in Tromsø and several vessels.

The primary responsibility of the Institute of Marine Research is to provide advice to national authorities, society and industry regarding questions related to the ecosystems of the Barents Sea, the Norwegian Sea, the North Sea and the Norwegian coastal zone and in the field of aquaculture. The institute is heavily engaged in development aid activities through its Centre for Development Cooperation in Fisheries.

Norwegian Fisheries Investigations (&quot;Norske Fiskeriundersøgelser&quot;) was initiated in Oslo in 1864. In 1900 the investigations was located to Bergen, and in 1947, the institute was separated as a research institute under the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries. To further ensure its independence, the institute became an independent institution in 1989.

Among important scientific contributions was Johan Hjort&#x27;s pivotal work on «Fluctuations in the Great Fisheries of Northern Europe» (1914). Einar Lea&#x27;s use of ASDIC to find herring schools (1947) and the use of Echo Integration for estimating fish abundance (Midtun &amp; Hoff, 1962) are also notable.

<text>The figbirds are a genus (&quot;Sphecotheres&quot;) in the family of Old World orioles found in wooded habitats in Australia, New Guinea, and the Lesser Sundas. 

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Formerly, the three species have been considered conspecific, but all major authorities now consider them as separate species. The split is primarily based on differences in measurements, plumage, and biogeography.

===Species===
Three species are recognized:
==Description==
They are strongly sexually dimorphic, with males having olive-green upperparts, a black head, and (uniquely for the family) distinct bright red facial skin. Females are drab-coloured, being dull brownish above, and white below with strong dark streaking. They have greyish facial skin, and a greyish-black bill.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Compared to the &quot;typical&quot; Old World orioles of the genus &quot;Oriolus&quot;, the figbirds are more frugivorous (though they also take some small insects, nectar, and seeds) and gregarious, even breeding in small, loose colonies (at least for the Australasian figbird; the nesting habits are still unknown for the other two species).

<doc id="474767" wikidata="Q845218" url="?curid=474767" title="Viologen">
<text>Viologens are organic compounds with the formula (C5H4NR)2n+. In some viologens, the pyridyl groups are further modified.

Viologens are called so, because these compounds produce violet color on reduction [violet + Latin &quot;gen&quot;, generator of]. 

The viologen paraquat (R = methyl), is a widely used herbicide. As early as in the 1930s, paraquat was being used as an oxidation-reduction indicator, because it becomes violet on reduction.

Other viologens have been commercialized because they can change color reversibly many times through reduction and oxidation. The name viologen alludes to violet, one color it can exhibit, and the radical cation (C5H4NR)2+ is colored intensely blue.

==Types of viologens==
As bipyridinium derivatives, the viologens are related to 4,4&#x27;-bipyridyl. The basic nitrogen centers in these compounds are alkylated to give viologens:
:(C5H4N)2 + 2 RX → [(C5H4NR)2]2+(X−)2 
The alkylation is a form of quaternization. When the alkylating agent is a small alkyl halide, such as methyl chloride or methyl bromide, the viologen salt is often water-soluble. A wide variety of alkyl substituents have been investigated. Common derivatives are methyl (see paraquat), long chain alkyl, and benzyl.

==Redox properties==
Viologens, in their dicationic form, typically undergo two one-electron reductions. The first reduction affords the deeply colored radical cation:
: [V]2+ + e− [V]+
The radical cations are blue for 4,4&#x27;-viologens and green for 2,2&#x27;-derivatives. The second reduction yields a yellow quinoid compounds:
: [V]+ + e− [V]0

The electron transfer is fast because the redox process induces little structural change. The redox is highly reversible. These reagents are relatively inexpensive among redox-active organic compounds. They are convenient colorimetric reagents for biochemical redox reactions.

==Research==
Their tendency to form host–guest complexes is key to the molecular machines recognized by the 2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
Viologens are used in the negative electrolytes of some experimental flow batteries. Viologens have been modified to optimize their performance in such batteries, e.g. by incorporating them into redox-active polymers.

Viologen catalysts have been reported to have the potential to oxidize glucose and other carbohydrates catalytically in a mildly alkaline solution, which makes direct carbohydrate fuel cells possible.

==Modified viologens and related compounds==
Diquat is an isomer of viologens, being derived from 2,2&#x27;-bipyridine (instead of the 4,4&#x27;-isomer). It also is a potent herbicide that functions by disrupting electron-transfer.
Extended viologens have been developed based on conjugated oligomers such as based on aryl, ethylene, and thiophene units are inserted between the pyridine units. The bipolaron di-octyl bis(4-pyridyl)biphenyl viologen 2 in &quot;scheme 2&quot; can be reduced by sodium amalgam in DMF to the neutral viologen 3.

The resonance structures of the quinoid 3a and the biradical 3b contribute equally to the hybrid structure. The driving force for the contributing 3b is the restoration of aromaticity with the biphenyl unit. It has been established using X-ray crystallography that the molecule is, in effect, coplanar with slight nitrogen pyramidalization, and that the central carbon bonds are longer (144 pm) than what would be expected for a double bond (136 pm). Further research shows that the diradical exists as a mixture of triplets and singlets, although an ESR signal is absent. In this sense, the molecule resembles Tschischibabin&#x27;s hydrocarbon, discovered during 1907. It also shares with this molecule a blue color in solution, and a metallic-green color as crystals.

Compound 3 is a very strong reducing agent, with a redox potential of −1.48 V.

== Applications ==
The widely used herbicide paraquat is a viologen. This application is the largest consumer of this class of compounds. The toxicity of the 2,2&#x27;-, 4,4&#x27;-, or 2,4&#x27;-bipyridylium-based viologens is related to their ability to form stable free radicals. This redox activity allows these species to interfere with the electron transport chain in the plant.

Viologens have been commercialized as electrochromic systems because of their highly reversible and dramatic change of color upon reduction and oxidation. In some applications, N-heptyl viologens are used. Conducting solid supports such as titania and indium tin oxide have been used.

<text>DFI Retail Group Holdings Limited (formerly known as Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited) is a Hong Kong–based retail company with legal bases in Bermuda and Singapore. A subsidiary of the Jardine Matheson Group, it is a major East and Southeast Asian retailer involved in the processing and wholesaling of food and health and beauty products. Jardine Strategic, a publicly listed holding company, has an attributable 78 percent stake in the firm. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange, with secondary listings on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX).

The head office is in the Devon House in Taikoo Place, Quarry Bay, Hong Kong.

As of 31 December 2020, the Group, its associates and joint ventures operated over 9,997 outlets; Wellcome/Food World (supermarkets), a controlling stake in Maxim&#x27;s Catering (foodservice), Cold Storage (supermarkets), Jasons Market Place/Market Place by Jasons/Jasons Food Hall (high end supermarkets), Hero (supermarkets), Mannings/Guardian (health and beauty) stores; it also operates 7-Eleven (convenience stores) throughout the region, and IKEA (home furnishings) stores in Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia and Taiwan.

The group and its associates and joint ventures operated over 9,997 outlets, employed over 220,000 people and had total annual sales in excess of US$28.2 billion.

==History==

Dairy Farm was set up in 1886 by Sir Patrick Manson, a Scottish surgeon, and five well known Hong Kong businessmen. They initially aimed to improve the health of Hong Kong people by providing them with non-contaminated cows&#x27; milk and to import a herd of dairy cattle so as to decrease the price of milk by more than half. The farm was located in Pok Fu Lam.

In 1890, Dairy Farm built a low-rise brick and stucco building on Lower Albert Road in Central for use as a cold storage warehouse. This warehouse was later renovated and expanded in 1913 to include a dairy shop, a room for meat smoking, a cold storage room for winter clothes and residency for its manager. The building later evolved into the company headquarters until the company moved in the 1970s. The abandoned building was acquired by the Hong Kong Fringe Club, a non-profit-making arts organisation in 1984, and has been carefully restored. This distinctive 19th century building, now known as the Old Dairy Farm Depot, is a well-known landmark in Central providing a wide variety of cultural activities and performances.

In 1904, Dairy Farm began importing frozen meat and opened its first retail store at the Central District depot. The second Dairy Farm store was established on Nathan Road, Kowloon towards the end of the war in 1918. Amongst other things, this store provided fishing boats in Hong Kong with large amounts of ice.

In 1960, Dairy Farm and Lane Crawford formed a merged food retailing operations and renamed these supermarkets as Dairy Lane under Dairy Lane Limited. This joint business was undone by the acquisition of the Wellcome chain in 1964.

In 1972, Dairy Farm was acquired by Hong Kong Land, a Jardines subsidiary. In 1986 Dairy Farm was relisted on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange after it was demerged from Hong Kong Land. Dairy Farm acquired a 50% interest in Maxim&#x27;s at the same time from Hong Kong Land. The 7-Eleven convenience store chain in Hong Kong and Singapore was acquired from Jardine Matheson in 1989.

Since 1999, Dairy Farm has continued to expand its footprint by acquiring supermarket and other retail operations in Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. Notably, it also acquired IKEA Hong Kong, Taiwan in 2002 and began Ikea&#x27;s Indonesian operation in 2014.

In May 2012, Dairy Farm bought a 50% stake in the Rustan Supercenters, Inc., the Rustan group&#x27;s supermarket chain. 36% came from the Tantoco family and 14% from the Spinnaker group. Its holdings increased to 64% in 2015 and 100% in 2017. On March 23, 2018, the entire stake was sold to Robinsons Retail Holdings, Inc. through a stock swap, yielding Dairy Farm 18.25% of Robinsons Retail Holdings, Inc. stock. In 2018, therefore, Rustan Supercenters are fully acquired by Robinsons Retail Holdings the 20.00% of which is owned by Mulgrave Corporation and GCH Investments, wholly owned subsidiaries of Dairy Farm.

As of June 2011, Dairy Farm is 78% owned by Jardine Matheson Holdings.

In August 2021, Dairy Farm rebranded its trading name to DFI Retail Group. On 5 May 2022, the company subsequently changed its legal name to DFI Retail Group Holdings Limited, effectively phased out the Dairy Farm branding.

==Discontinued operations==
*In 1998, Dairy Farm sold out its 49% interest in Nestlé Dairy Farm, set up in 1992 to develop dairy products factories throughout China, to Nestlé; on the merger of Kwik Save with Somerfield, Dairy Farm sold its 11% holding for US$290 million. Dairy Farm acquired 25% of the &quot;No Frills&quot; Kwik Save Group in 1987; Sold the 108-store Simago chain in Spain acquired in 1990.
*In March 2000, Dairy Farm sold its half share in DFI Géant, the Taiwan hypermarket opened in 1998 back to Casino, its joint venture partner.
*In 2001, the company sold the 287-store Franklins chain in Australia which it acquired in 1978. Its Hong Kong–based distribution business, Sims Trading, was sold to CITIC Pacific.
*In June 2002, the 61-store Woolworths chain in New Zealand acquired in 1990, was sold for US$337 million.

== Controversy ==
Wellcome, a major food retailer owned by Dairy Farm Group, have been cited by the Taiwanese government for 33 labor violations in Taiwan. These include instances of maintaining unsafe work spaces that potentially endangered employees, having staff members work unpaid overtime beyond legal limitations, and refusing pay and rest time to employees.

<doc id="474781" wikidata="Q472210" url="?curid=474781" title="Particle in a ring">
<text>In quantum mechanics, the case of a particle in a one-dimensional ring is similar to the particle in a box. The Schrödinger equation for a free particle which is restricted to a ring (technically, whose configuration space is the circle formula_1) is

:formula_2

== Wave function ==

Using polar coordinates on the 1-dimensional ring of radius R, the wave function depends only on the angular coordinate, and so
:formula_3

Requiring that the wave function be periodic in formula_4 with a period formula_5 (from the demand that the wave functions be single-valued functions on the circle), and that they be normalized leads to the conditions

:formula_6,

and

:formula_7

Under these conditions, the solution to the Schrödinger equation is given by

:formula_8

== Energy eigenvalues ==

The energy eigenvalues formula_9 are quantized because of the periodic boundary conditions, and they are required to satisfy

:formula_10, or
:formula_11

The eigenfunction and eigenenergies are
:formula_12
:formula_13 where formula_14

Therefore, there are two degenerate quantum states for every value of formula_15 (corresponding to formula_16). Therefore, there are formula_17 states with energies up to an energy indexed by the number formula_18.

The case of a particle in a one-dimensional ring is an instructive example when studying the quantization of angular momentum for, say, an electron orbiting the nucleus. The azimuthal wave functions in that case are identical to the energy eigenfunctions of the particle on a ring.

The statement that any wavefunction for the particle on a ring can be written as a superposition of energy eigenfunctions is exactly identical to the Fourier theorem about the development of any periodic function in a Fourier series.

This simple model can be used to find approximate energy levels of some ring molecules, such as benzene.

== Application ==

In organic chemistry, aromatic compounds contain atomic rings, such as benzene rings (the Kekulé structure) consisting of five or six, usually carbon, atoms. So does the surface of &quot;buckyballs&quot; (buckminsterfullerene). This ring behaves like a circular waveguide, with the valence electrons orbiting in both directions. To fill all energy levels up to n requires formula_19 electrons, as electrons have additionally two possible orientations of their spins. This gives exceptional stability (&quot;aromatic&quot;), and is known as the Hückel&#x27;s rule.

Further in rotational spectroscopy this model may be used as an approximation of rotational energy levels.

<text>Loughborough High School is an independent school for girls in Loughborough, Leicestershire, England. It is one of five independent schools known collectively as the Loughborough Schools Foundation (LSF), Loughborough Grammar School for boys, Fairfield Preparatory School and Loughborough Amherst School, and the newly founded Loughborough Nursery. All five of the Schools are autonomous, and yet they share the same vision and educational ethos, supported by a united board of governors. Founded on 11 March, 1850, it is believed to be one of the country&#x27;s oldest independent schools for girls.

==History==

===Founding===
The Loughborough Schools Foundation (formerly Loughborough Endowed Schools) was founded after Thomas Burton, a prosperous wool merchant from Loughborough, willed money for priests to pray for his soul upon his death in 1495; these priests went on to found the boys school that would become Loughborough Grammar School (LGS). It was not until 1850, when the boys school moved to a new site to the south of Loughborough town centre and it became more socially acceptable to educate women, that the foundation was extended to girls and Loughborough High School (LHS) was founded.

The school celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2000, when it was visited by The Princess Royal.

===School Hymn===
Loughborough Schools Foundation school hymn entitled &quot;Our Father by whose servant(s)&quot; was created originally for Loughborough Grammar School by Old Loughburian George Wallace Briggs and, in more recent times, has been adopted as a school hymn by the Foundation. The servant in the song refers to Thomas Burton, and the &quot;Five Hundred Years Enduring&quot; in verse 2 (originally &quot;Four Hundred Years Enduring&quot;) is unique to the founding year of the Loughborough Schools Foundation.

==Campus==
LHS is situated on a multi-acre campus on the south side of Loughborough town centre; the three Schools are adjacent to one another, laid out along Burton Walks. The main bulk of the LHS part of the campus faces onto a central quadrangle. The east-side of the quad, closest to the main access of Burton Walks, is occupied by what is the oldest building which houses the administration, including the Headmistress&#x27; study and the Cope library. This building continues around the north side where it contains the great hall, art studios, technology rooms and a lecture room. Attached to the end of this building are the Cloisters and Rokeby which largely comprise classrooms, the staff room and a sixth form common room. Within the centre of the quad is a large patch of grass that, up until recent years, was used as grass tennis courts. Other general classroom buildings facing the quad are the Chesterton Building to the west and the Charles Block to the south. The drama building is to the south and, on the other side of Burton Walks, is the Loughborough Schools Foundation Music Department, a separate building shared between the Foundation as a music facility.

Also on the other side of Burton Walks are the Parkin Sports Centre, recently completed in 2019, the science buildings and astroturf pitch, the latter of which is shared with the rest of the Foundation. Other campus buildings include the Fairfield Preparatory School, the gate house, and houses for the headmaster of LGS and the headmistress of LHS. Across Burton Street (adjacent to Burton Walks) and along Gray Street is Loughborough Amherst School (formerly Our Lady&#x27;s Convent School).

==Pupils==
LHS is an all-girls school, educating those from the ages of 11 to 18, however there are some joint lessons in the sixth form with the all-boys Loughborough Grammar and the co-educational Loughborough Amherst, both part of the Foundation. In the past it was (like the present Grammar School) a boarding school, however in recent years all-female boarding has gradually ceased.

==Academics==
Candidates sit an entrance examination to gain admission to the school, usually at the age of 10, so as to enter year 7 at the age of 11. There is also a 13+ exam, for those wishing to enter at Year 9, and a 16+ exam for girls wishing to enter at Sixth Form level (Year 12.)

Girls are entered for GCSE examinations in Year 11, AS-levels in Year 12 and A Levels in Year 13. Girls usually take 9/10 subjects for GCSE, 1 for AS-level and 3 for A-level.

==Extracurricular activities==

===Music and Drama===
The construction of a new Music Department by the Foundation in 2006 enabled a greater level of co-operation than had previously been possible. Two orchestras, a choir and a number of swing/jazz bands are among the ensembles run at the Music School, and these perform regularly at school concerts and elsewhere. The Schools&#x27; Big Band and Concert Band have competed nationally at the English Concert Band Festival, and these bands also tour abroad regularly.

Girls from the High School also regularly appear in joint dramatic productions, at the 182-seat Drama Studio located within the Queen&#x27;s Building at the Grammar School, the Drama Studio at the High School or the Hodson Hall.

===Sport===
LHS has teams in hockey, netball, cross country and athletics, and competes to national level and regularly win leagues and championships. Rounders, football, rugby and tennis are also taught.

===Other===
The school runs an active Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award scheme and a number of clubs and societies run regularly, including a debating society.

The school engages in regular charity fund-raising events, including non-uniform days and cake sales.

Girls are allowed to join the Foundation Combined Cadet Force in Year 10.

==House system==
LHS operates a house system; every girl is placed in one of four houses:

*Burton (Yellow)
*Fearon (Purple)
*Hastings (Green)
*Storer (Blue)

The houses are named after notable people within the founding of both the Endowed Schools and the social architecture of Loughborough town centre. Burton is named after Thomas Burton, the founder of the Loughborough Endowed Schools and Hastings after Henry Hastings, 1st Baron Loughborough. Storer is named after Johnathan Storer who, in 1713, founded a charity conveying cottages and land in Loughborough to eleven trustees, allowing the purchase of wheat to make bread and clothing, which was distributed to poor people living in the town. Fearon is named for Archdeacon Henry Fearon who in 1870 financed the oldest edifice in Market Square, the drinking fountain, allowing Loughborough to gain its first piped water supply. The house system provides internal competition in a number of sporting disciplines as well as extracurricular activities, including music and drama. Each house possesses a House Captain and a Games Captain in addition to the Housemistress.

<text>Ian Page (born 19 June 1960) is a British musician, gamebook author, and vocalist in the band Secret Affair.

==Career==
Teaming up with guitarist David Cairns while at school, Ian Page formed power pop/punk band New Hearts and signed to CBS Records in 1977, releasing two singles and touring with the Jam before the demise of the New Hearts in 1978.

Continuing to work with Cairns and forming Secret Affair, the two songwriters spent the second half of 1978 writing songs that would form the basis of the first two Secret Affair albums. Page sang lead vocals in the group and is also credited as the band&#x27;s trumpeter and keyboardist on the sleeve of their first album, &quot;Glory Boys&quot;. In a period of a little over two years, the band posted five releases in the UK Singles Chart, and released three albums. The debut single &quot;Time for Action&quot; sold 198,000 copies and reached number 13 in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, giving them their highest chart position. Lesser chart success followed with &quot;Let Your Heart Dance&quot;, &quot;My World&quot; and &quot;Sound of Confusion&quot;.

Secret Affair regularly appeared on UK television show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and were cover stars of many UK magazines, including &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, &quot;Sounds&quot; and &quot;Smash Hits&quot;. Likened to Jimmy Pursey, Ian Page was often asked to appear on UK television programmes, although his opinionated views sometimes alienated as many potential fans as they won over.

After the split of Secret Affair in 1982, Page released two solo singles – &quot;Too Young&quot; and &quot;Unity Street&quot; – under the name of Ian Page and Bop before leaving music. In his lyrics he had often railed against the music industry and his decision to quit the business was borne out of the same frustration.

By the mid-1980s, he turned fantasy author, and wrote a series of spin-off books in the Lone Wolf universe titled &quot;The World of Lone Wolf&quot;.

In 1999, he returned to the live stage, touring with his band Ian Page and The Affair (Bob Clarke – drums, Jerry Lee – guitar, Ian Jones – bass), performing a mixture of his own hits, soul covers and new material. Starting off with a show at Colchester Arts Centre,playing a mix of Secret Affair tunes and soul covers , followed by a performance at Londons Forum as part of the Mods May day 99 gig, 20 years on from the original Mods May day gig, introduced on to stage that day by Tony Clark who went on to be The Affairs manager touring with the band all over the UK, Europe and Scandinavia. With this band he released a series of singles, including &quot;Prove It&quot;. He parted company with this band in 2007, having recorded the largest part of an as yet unreleased album.

In 2002, he once again teamed up with Dave Cairns to reform Secret Affair, initially for three gigs in the UK, including a performance at London&#x27;s Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire. They returned in June the following year, playing at The Scala in London to promote the release of &quot;Time For Action: The Anthology&quot; (Sanctuary), a major CD retrospective of hits, rarities and previously unreleased tracks. The concert was filmed and released on DVD. In 2005, Page and Cairns attempted to mend their sometimes fractious relationship and started work on a fourth Secret Affair album, recording five new songs. The album eventually came to fruition in 2012, entitled &quot;Soho Dreams&quot;, entirely financed by the band without any record company involvement. In 2017, they continued to tour and record as Secret Affair and celebrate their 40th anniversary in 2019 with a 14 date UK April/May spring tour.

== Personal life ==
Page lives in Essex and is a Tottenham Hotspur F.C. supporter.

<doc id="474795" wikidata="Q942847" url="?curid=474795" title="Electronic Road Pricing">
<text>The Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system is an electronic toll collection scheme adopted in Singapore to manage traffic by way of road pricing, and as a usage-based taxation mechanism to complement the purchase-based Certificate of Entitlement system. There are a total of 93 ERP gantries located throughout the country, along expressways and roads leading towards the Central Area. As of July 2024, only 19 ERP gantries are in operation and are all in expressways where congestion continues to be severe.

The ERP was implemented by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) on April 1, 1998 to replace the preceding Singapore Area Licensing Scheme (ALS) that was first introduced on 11 August 1974 after successfully stress-testing the system with vehicles running at high speed. The system uses open road tolling; vehicles do not stop or slow down to pay tolls.

Singapore was the first city in the world to implement an electronic road toll collection system for purposes of congestion pricing. Its use has inspired other cities around the world in adopting a similar system, particularly London&#x27;s Congestion Charge Zone (CCZ), Stockholm&#x27;s congestion tax, and New York City&#x27;s Central Business District Tolling Program. It has also been proposed in San Francisco.

==The system==
===Current system===

The scheme consists of ERP gantries located at expressways where traffic was being built up during peak hours. The gantry system is actually a system of sensors on two gantries, one in front of the other. Cameras are also attached to the gantries to capture the rear license plate numbers of vehicles. No new gantries have been implemented since January 2016.

A device known as an In-vehicle Unit (IU) is affixed on the lower right corner of the front windscreen within sight of the driver, in which a stored-value card, the NETS CashCard, is inserted for payment of the road usage charges. The second generation IU accepts Contactless NETS FlashPay and EZ-Link. The cost of an IU is S$150. It is mandatory for all Singapore-registered vehicles to be fitted with an IU if they wish to use the priced roads.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd sold the IU technology to Singapore, and the project was spearheaded by a consortium comprising Philips Singapore Pte Ltd., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Miyoshi Electronic Corporation and CEI Systems and Engineering (now known as CSE Global Ltd.) in 1995 through an open tender.

When a vehicle equipped with an IU passes under an ERP gantry, a road usage charge is deducted from the CashCard in the IU. Sensors installed on the gantries communicate with the IU via a dedicated short-range communication system, and the deducted amount is displayed to the driver on an LCD screen of the IU.

===ERP 2.0 system===
The ERP 2.0 system is a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) based system, as opposed to the current system with physical gantries located along expressways, as well as roads and arterial roads leading to the CBD. With the new system, the ERP scheme will move towards a distance based charging policy, instead of the current system, where a fixed toll is charged when vehicles pass through a physical ERP gantry. 

It is anticipated that there will no longer be any need for physical ERP gantries when the system is fully implemented and activated. After all the vehicles are installed with the new OBU, existing ERP gantries will be removed with new visual markers or signs to indicate ERP charging locations.

Current IU systems will be replaced by onboard units (OBUs) with one-piece units for motorcycles and three-piece units for other vehicles, due to the fact that the current IU system is not operable with the SimplyGo card system that was being introduced in 2017.

Co-developed by NCS Group and MHI Engine System, the Onboard Unit (OBU) will be rolled out in phases and the installation is slated to be completed by 2025. The OBU consists of three components for all vehicles, except for motorcycles, which will remain a one-piece unit.

The three-piece units consists of an antenna, processing unit and a touchscreen display. The antenna and touchscreen display will be affixed on the lower right corner of the front windscreen within sight of the driver, while the processing unit is located on the right side of the passenger side footwell for the three-piece unit. 

The OBU is expected to have various features, including being able to display real-time traffic information, and facilitate couponless parking and automatic payment.

Vehicle owners can choose to not install the touchscreen display, but will be unable to adjust the volume of the OBU. Other features such as a future payment system that will be introduced to the OBU, live traffic data and updates, can be accessed via smartphone applications developed with software development kits released by LTA.

Road users are able to use Contactless e-Purse Application Specification (CEPAS) cards, which can inserted into the processing unit.

LTA announced that the distance-based charging policy will not be implemented in the near future, with no concrete date on when the new policy will take place. The current ERP charges will remain the same, with the OBUs able to work the same as the IUs when passing through a physical ERP gantry. The physical gantries will be removed in a 3-phase plan after the installation of OBUs is completed in all vehicles.

===Toll charges===

The charge for passing through a gantry depends on the location and time. Foreign visitors driving foreign-registered private vehicles on priced roads, during the ERP operating hours, could choose to either rent an IU or pay a daily flat fee of S$5 regardless how many ERP gantries entered, the payment is done and information is stored by Autopass Card until the vehicle leaves Singapore. Foreign-registered commercial vehicles, however, are required to install an IU.

If a vehicle owner does not have sufficient value in their CashCard (or EZ-Link) when passing through an ERP, the owner receives a fine by post within two weeks. The violator must pay the ERP charges plus a $10 administration fee within two weeks of the notice. Online payment is allowed; listing just the Vehicle Registration Number is required. Otherwise, a penalty of S$70 is issued by registered post to the vehicle owner, which rises to S$1000, or one month in jail, if not settled within 30 days.

== History ==
=== ERP 1.0 ===
A lightweight version of the ERP technology has been implemented for use on parking, and is known as the Electronic Parking System (EPS). It has been adopted by several carpark operators and has replaced the use of autopay tickets or parking coupons. These parking systems have also typically switched to charging by the minute.

In an effort to improve the pricing mechanism and to introduce real-time variable pricing, Singapore&#x27;s Land Transport Authority, together with IBM, ran a pilot from December 2006 to April 2007, with a traffic estimation and prediction tool (TrEPS), which uses historical traffic data and real-time feeds with flow conditions from several sources, to predict the levels of congestion up to an hour in advance. By accurate estimating prevailing and emerging traffic conditions, this technology is expected to allow variable pricing, together with improved overall traffic management, including the provision of information in advance to alert drivers about conditions ahead, and the prices being charged at that moment.

This system integrates with the various LTA&#x27;s traffic management existing systems, such as the Green Link Determining System (GLIDE), TrafficScan, Expressway Monitoring Advisory System (EMAS), Junction Electronic Eyes (J-Eyes), and the Electronic Road Pricing system. The pilot results were successful, showing overall prediction results above 85 percent of accuracy. Furthermore, when more data was available, during peak hours, average accuracy raised near or above 90 percent from 10 minutes up to 60 minutes predictions in the future.

During 2020, ERP was mostly suspended due to circuit breaker measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. 

In 2021, the LTA stated that the existing ERP system, which was about 22 years old at that time, was &quot;reaching the end of its operational life&quot;.

During COVID-19, rate reviews were more frequent in February, April, May, August, September and November. After COVID-19, rate reviews were only reduced to February and August.
=== ERP 2.0 ===
According to a paper presented in the World Roads Conference 2006, the LTA had been testing a system based on the Global Positioning System that may eventually replace the current Electronic Road Pricing system. The proposed system was said to be able to overcome the inflexibility of having physical gantries, which &quot;are not so flexible when it comes to re-locating them&quot;. 

In 2010, then-Transport Minister Raymond Lim announced that a new ERP system was being considered and a tender for the new system would be announced later. Subsequently, a tender was called and in 2016, NCS and MHI Engine System were jointly awarded the contract to install the new ERP 2.0 system for S$556 million, which was less than ST Electronics&#x27;s bid of S$1.2 billion. It was reported that the rollout of the new ERP system would begin in 2020. Then-Chief Executive of LTA stated at the time that the NCS-MHI bid &quot;came within our budget&quot; and was superior to ST Electronics&#x27;, and he was confident that NCS-MHI would be able to &quot;execute the project in a commercially-viable way&quot; notwithstanding the large difference between the bids. 

The ERP 2.0 system was said to replace the existing IU with a more sophisticated OBU the size of a smartphone with various features. The new OBU was intended to be able to provide real-time traffic information and alert drivers of toll roads and the associated charges well in advance. 

In September 2020, the initial design of the OBU for vehicles other than motorcycles, such as cars, was criticised as being clunky, inelegant and bulky.

It was also reported that as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore in 2020, the fitting of the new OBUs would be delayed to the second half of 2021, with the new ERP system expected to become operational in mid 2023.

In November 2021, the deployment was delayed again to the second half of 2023 due to a global shortage of microchips for the OBUs. Then-Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat also stated that the technology required for distance-based charging &quot;is still several years away&quot;.

Some commentators described the OBU design as &quot;old-fashioned&quot;, stating that &quot;the tech is too old&quot; and observed that the new OBU would require more space and more wiring than the existing IU.

In October 2023, LTA announced that the new system would begin to replace the existing ERP system from November 2023 onwards. All vehicles are expected to be fitted with the new on-board units by the end of 2025 but the system will not be turned on until further notice.

In March 2024, it was reported that various motorists using the ERP 2.0 system had complained about the location of the card reader component of the OBU. In cars, the card reader was generally installed in the passenger footwell, which made it difficult for drivers to insert or remove their CEPAS card from the driver&#x27;s seat. In response, the LTA stated that it would make changes to the system to allow drivers to temporarily deactivate their CEPAS card using the touchscreen without having to remove the card physically. The LTA also stated that it would allow drivers to decide where to install the card reader component, subject to space constraints in the relevant vehicle and technical feasibility. 

As of April 2024, more than 13,000 vehicles had been fitted with the new OBUs, of which about 75% were company vehicles, such as buses and motorcycles.

In May 2024, the LTA refuted allegations that the new OBUs did not comply with international standards. According to the LTA, the OBU had been tested against the International Electrotechnical Commission’s IEC-60068 and IEC-60529 and therefore &quot;meets the relevant global benchmarks for electronic devices&quot; and &quot;when properly installed, it is safe and reliable to use in our operating environment&quot;.

==Impact==
A study on the long-term effects of congestion pricing in Singapore claimed that &quot;traffic congestion had not been eliminated—it had merely been shifted in time and location&quot; and that the average travel time has increased. 

In contrast, another report stated that road traffic decreased by nearly 25,000 vehicles during peak hours, with average road speeds increasing by about 20%. Within the restricted zone itself, traffic has gone down by about 13% during ERP operational hours, with vehicle numbers dropping from 270,000 to 235,000. It has been observed that car-pooling and public transport has increased, while the hours of peak vehicular traffic has also gradually eased and spread into off-peak hours, suggesting a more productive use of road space. In addition, it has been noted that average road speeds for expressways and major roads remained the same, despite rising traffic volumes over the years.

In some cases, the implementation of an ERP gantry along a road may move the traffic to outer roads or shift would-be car users towards public transport. One instance of this is that the ERP gantries have been said to have caused traffic to increase substantially in the arterial roads. In response, congestion on the East Coast Parkway was relieved with the opening of Marina Coastal Expressway on 29 December 2013. The rising traffic has prompted the LTA to encourage more Singaporeans to switch to public transport as part of the country&#x27;s general &quot;car-lite society&quot; plan, by building more MRT train lines and introducing more bus services. The full completion of the Downtown MRT line on 21 October 2017 complements the Pan Island Expressway. The Thomson–East Coast MRT line also runs largely parallel to the Seletar Expressway and East Coast Parkway.

==Adoption by other metropolitan areas==
In Ontario, Canada, an electronic road pricing system is used on Highway 407 to collect tolls electronically and billed to the owner of the car by taking a picture of its license plate.

The ERP system attracted the attention of transport planners and managers in other metropolitan areas, particularly those in Europe and the United States. For example, the London congestion charge was introduced on 17 February 2003, after London officials visited Singapore to study the ERP system, and used it as a reference for the London system. London&#x27;s charge area was expanded in 2007.

The Stockholm congestion tax is also a congestion pricing system implemented as a tax which is levied on most vehicles entering and exiting central Stockholm, Sweden. The congestion tax was implemented on a permanent basis on 1 August 2007, after a seven-month trial period was held between 3 January 2006 and 31 July 2006.

In 2007, Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, implemented a corridor congestion pricing scheme called Salik which works on similar principles. In January 2008, Milan introduced a traffic charge scheme as a one-year trial, called Ecopass, and exempts high emission standard vehicles and some alternate fuel vehicles. This tax was substituted in 2012 by the Area C system, which places a charge on nearly all vehicles entering the city centre during weekdays.

A similar system is expected to be operational on selected roads in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia by early 2019.

<text>Peace One Day is a non-profit organisation whose objective is to institutionalise the International Day of Peace. It was founded in 1999 by British documentary filmmaker and actor Jeremy Gilley.

==History==

In 1999, Jeremy Gilley desired there should be one single day when all countries vowed not to wage war: a worldwide ceasefire and day of non-violence. He established Peace One Day. The United Nations had already declared the third Tuesday of September the International Day of Peace, Peace One Day aimed to resolve the confusion on which calendar day it fell, and on 7 September 2001, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution formally establishing the UN International Day of Peace an annual Peace Day of global ceasefire and non-violence on 21 September.

The former UK ambassador to the United Nations, Jeremy Greenstock, credited Peace One Day&#x27;s campaign with playing a central role in the new resolutions processes and commented that &quot;the need for such an enhanced approach was originally brought to our attention by a United Kingdom-based non-governmental organisation, Peace One Day&quot;.

Currently, Jeremy Gilley and his organisation are focused upon institutionalising the International Day of Peace.

== Campaigns ==
===Peace Day in Afghanistan===

In 2007, Jeremy Gilley and Peace One Day Ambassador Jude Law travelled to Jalalabad and Kabul to meet with representatives from the United Nations, the Afghan government, and other organisations. They initiated a campaign alongside WHO, UNICEF, and the Ministry of Public Health, which resulted in providing 1.4 million children with the monovalent P3 polio vaccine in southern Afghanistan and selected areas in eastern Afghanistan.

In 2008 there was a 70 per cent drop in violent incidents on Peace Day in Afghanistan following pledges by President Hamid Karzai and UN forces for a day of non-violence, and by 2010 the campaign had resulted in the immunisation against polio of 4.5 million children in areas hitherto unreachable due to conflict.

===One Day One Goal===

In 2008, Peace One Day launched the One Day One Goal initiative – aiming to host football matches in all member states of the United Nations on the International Day of Peace. The campaign quickly garnered attention, gaining support from figures such as David Beckham, Gary Lineker, and Victor Wanyama.

The success of their One Day One Goal prompted similar campaigns, such as Try for Peace – supported by figures such as Sir Clive Woodward and Maggie Alphonsi.

===Try For Peace===

Peace One Day launched a campaign that saw thousands of people playing all different forms of rugby in countries across the globe in the spirit of peace and reconciliation on 21 September. Supporters included Sir Clive Woodward (2003 Rugby World Cup winning Head Coach and 2012 Team GB Director of Sport) and Maggie Alphonsi (former flanker for Saracens W.R.F.C. and England). Highlights of the campaign included matches in Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda.

===Set For Peace===

This campaign saw DJs such as Idris Elba, Paul van Dyk, David Morales, Capital FM&#x27;s Andi Durrant and thousands of others around the world play sets for peace to bring people together on 21 September. Notable Set for Peace events took place in the DRC, Japan, Spain and The Maldives.

===One Day One Dance===

One Day One Dance has seen thousands of people all over the world dancing on or around Peace Day, 21 September. From flash mobs in Lithuania and Cayman Islands, to school performances in Russia and Kenya, amateurs and professionals came together to stand for peace, with hundreds of dances taking place every year around world in the name of peace. The campaign encompasses all forms of dance at every level and has seen activation by organisations as diverse as Hong Kong Ballet and Zumba.

===Coca-Cola===

In 2009, Coca-Cola for the first time in its history launched a special-edition charity can on behalf of the non-profit organisation, Peace One Day.

===Adidas &amp; Puma===

In 2009, Peace One Day led an initiative that brought together Adidas and Puma for the first time in decades on Peace Day 21 September. The sportswear companies symbolically ended their feud with a handshake and a football match on the day.

===Peace Day Burger===

For Peace Day 2012, Peace One Day coordinated action between Burger King, Denny&#x27;s, Wayback, Krystal, Giraffas to create a single burger from five brands on Peace Day. The pop-up shop distributed 1,500 Peace Day Burgers to raise money for the Peace One Day.

===Innocent Drinks===

In 2012, Innocent Drinks sponsored Peace One Day&#x27;s Global Truce 2012 initiative.

===Peace Day in The Great Lakes===

In 2013, Peace One Day launched a three-year campaign in African Great Lakes to promote the International Day of Peace, and to manifest community action. The project raised awareness of Peace Day in Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

===Cyber Non-violence===

In 2019, Peace One Day launched a new campaign focussed on the reduction of cyber violence, seeking to decrease online hate speech, racism, bullying and ridicule on Peace Day 21 September. The campaign utilises the hashtags #CyberNonViolence #OnlineNonViolence #PeaceDay21&quot;.

===Make Tea Time Peace Time===

In 2020, Peace One Day partnered with Lipton Ice Tea for the Peace One Day Live Global Digital Experience on Peace Day 21 September. Alongside the broadcast, Lipton and Peace One Day launched a campaign called &#x27;Make Tea Time Peace Time&#x27;. To share the message, Lipton and Peace One Day took over iconic clock towers and landmarks around the world, including Australia, Malaysia, UAE, France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, Mexico, Guatemala and Brazil.

Radio presenter and host Roman Kemp, supported the unveiling of the light installation at King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras.

The call to action, &quot;Tea Time. Peace Time&quot;, illuminated buildings and billboards crossing six time zones, in countdown to support Peace One Day reaching a potential audience of more than 4 billion people in just 24 hours.

<text>Pinus canariensis, the Canary Island pine, is a species of gymnosperm in the conifer family Pinaceae. It is a large, evergreen tree, native and endemic to the outer Canary Islands of the Atlantic Ocean.

==Description==
&quot;Pinus canariensis&quot; is a large evergreen tree, growing to tall and diameter at breast height, exceptionally up to tall and girth ( diameter). The green to yellow-green leaves are needle-like, in bundles of three, long, with finely toothed margins and often drooping. A characteristic of the species is the occurrence of epicormic shoots with single (not in threes) glaucous (bluish-green) juvenile leaves growing from the lower trunk, but in its natural area this only occurs as a consequence of fire or other damage. The cones are long, wide, glossy chestnut-brown in colour and frequently remaining closed for several years (serotinous cones). Its closest relatives are the chir pine (&quot;P. roxburghii&quot;) from the Himalayas, the Mediterranean pines &quot;P. pinea&quot;, &quot;P. halepensis&quot;, &quot;P. pinaster&quot; and &quot;P. brutia&quot; from the eastern Mediterranean.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Pinus canariensis&quot; was first described in 1825 by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle, who attributed the name to Christen Smith. It has been placed in subsection &quot;Pinaster&quot; of subgenus &quot;Pinus&quot;, section &quot;Pinus&quot;. The other species in the subsection are mainly Mediterranean in distribution, with one species (&quot;P. roxburghii&quot;) from the Himalayas.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is native and endemic to the outer Canary Islands (Gran Canaria, Tenerife, El Hierro and La Palma). It is a subtropical pine and does not tolerate low temperatures or hard frost, surviving temperatures down to about . Within its natural area, it grows under extremely variable rainfall regimes, from less than to several thousands, mostly due to differences in mist-capturing by the foliage. Under warm conditions, this is one of the most drought-tolerant pines, living even with less than of rainfall per year.

The native range has been somewhat reduced due to over-cutting so that only the islands of Tenerife, La Palma, and Gran Canaria still have large forests, with extensive replanting of deforested areas since 1940. Really big trees are rare due to past over-cutting. It is the tallest tree in the Canary Islands, with the tallest specimen, &#x27;Pino de las Dos Pernadas&#x27; near Vilaflor on Tenerife, being 56.7 m tall.

==Fossil record==
Fossils of &quot;Pinus canariensis&quot; have been described from the fossil flora of Kızılcahamam district in Turkey which is of early Pliocene age. Fossil cones including seeds of &quot;Pinus canariensis&quot; are known from the late Miocene of Abkhazia, from the Vienna Basin and the Canary Islands. Numerous cone casts including seeds of &quot;Pinus canariensis&quot; from the early Pleistocene, were recovered on Kallithea, Rhodes.

== Ecology ==
This pine is one of the most fire-resistant conifers in the world, due to several beneficial adaptations. In particular, &quot;Pinus canariensis&quot; is one of the few pine species that can epicormically resprout after losing its needles in a fire.

== Uses ==
The tree&#x27;s long needles make a significant contribution to the islands&#x27; water supply, trapping large amounts of cloud droplets as fog drip. This comes from the moist air coming off the Atlantic with the prevailing north eastern wind (locally called &quot;alisios&quot; or &quot;tiempo norte&quot;); the fog drip measured under trees can be up to 20 times the rainfall measured in the open away from trees at the same site. The condensation after dropping to the ground is quickly absorbed by the soil, and percolates down to the underground aquifers.

The aromatic wood, especially the heartwood, is among the finest of pine woods, being hard, strong and durable. The wood of the Canary island pine is now becoming popular as a tonewood for soundboards for guitars and other string instruments.

&quot;Pinus canariensis&quot; is a popular ornamental tree in warmer climates, such as in private gardens, public landscapes, and as street trees. In mainland Spain, South Africa, Sicily, Australia, and California, it has become a naturalised species from original landscape uses.

==In culture==
It is the vegetable symbol of the island of La Palma.

Severe winters restrict the northern limits of their range, while favorable weather conditions lead to a northward extension of their breeding range. Their preferred habitat is in dense cover in forest, farm edges, and suburban areas. This wren is the state bird of South Carolina.

Seven recognized subspecies occur across the range of these wrens and they differ slightly in song and appearance. The birds are generally inconspicuous, avoiding the open for extended periods of time. When out in the open, they energetically investigate their surroundings and are rarely stationary. After finding a mate, pairs maintain a territory and stay together for several years. Both males and females give out alarm calls, but only males sing to advertise territory. Carolina wrens raise multiple broods during the summer breeding season, but can fall victim to brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds, among other species. Some populations have been affected by mercury contamination.

==Taxonomy==
The Carolina wren was first described under the name of &quot;Sylvia ludoviciana&quot; by John Latham in 1790. Louis Pierre Vieillot considered all wrens under the genus &quot;Troglodytes&quot; and called the Carolina wren &quot;Troglodytes arundinaceus&quot;, but placed it subsequently in a separate genus &quot;Thryothorus&quot; (initially misspelled &quot;Thriothorus&quot;) that he created in 1816. 

===Etymology===
The genus name &quot;Thryothorus&quot; is of Greek origin from the combination of the noun θρύον : &quot;thrýon&quot; (&quot;rush, reed&quot;) and the adjective θοῦρος : &quot;thoũros&quot; (&quot;rushing, impetuous&quot;; derivative of verb θρῴσκειν : &quot;thrōskein&quot; to leap up, spring, jump at). Thus, &quot;Thryothorus&quot; 
means &#x27;reed jumper&#x27;.

Its specific name &quot;ludovicianus&quot; is a post-classical Latin term for &quot;Ludovicus&quot; (derivative from Louis XIV) that means &#x27;of Louisiana&#x27; that identifies the locality of the specimen collected near New Orleans.

===Species===
&quot;Thryothorus&quot; used to be the largest genus in the family Troglodytidae, with 27 species, but molecular phylogenetic studies revealed that it represented a polyphyletic assemblage of at least four independent clades now recognized at the genus level. The Carolina wren is now the only species within this genus.

The seven recognized subspecies of the Carolina wren are:

*&quot;T. l. ludovicianus&quot; (Latham, 1790) – southeast Canada (southern Ontario, irregularly in eastern and southern Quebec) and the eastern United States (southern Wisconsin and New England southward to Texas and northern Florida)
*&quot;T. l. miamensis&quot; Florida wren (Ridgway, 1875) – Florida from approximately 30°N (Gainesville) region southward through the rest of the state
*&quot;T. l. nesophilus&quot; Dog Island wren (Stevenson, 1973) – Dog Island in northwestern Florida
*&quot;T. l. burleighi&quot; – Burleigh&#x27;s Carolina wren (Lowery, 1940) Offshore islands off of the Mississippi coast: Cat Island, Ship Island (Mississippi), and Horn Island
*&quot;T. l. lomitensis&quot; – Lomita wren (Sennett, 1890) southern Texas to the extreme northeast of Mexico (Tamaulipas)
*&quot;T. l. berlandieri&quot; – Berlandier&#x27;s wren (S. F. Baird, 1858) - northeastern Mexico (eastern Coahuila, Nuevo León, and southwestern Tamaulipas)
*&quot;T. l. tropicalis&quot; – northeastern Mexico (eastern San Luis Potosí and southern Tamaulipas)
*&quot;T. ludovicianus&quot; is traditionally placed within its own genus as its only representative of North America, but recent DNA work suggests it is closely allied with the Bewick&#x27;s wren. A distinct population in the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico, Belize, Nicaragua, and in Guatemala is treated as a separate species, either known as Cabot&#x27;s wren or white-browed wren (&quot;Thryothorus albinucha&quot;). It is considered a subspecies of &quot;T. ludovicianus&quot; by some authors, however.

==Description==

At long, with a wingspan and a weight of about , the Carolina wren is a fairly large wren; the second largest in the United States species after the cactus wren. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the culmen is and the tarsus is . Sexual dimorphism is slight with males being larger than their mates. A study indicated that of 42 mated pairs, every male but one was larger than the female of the pair. The males were on average 11 percent heavier along with having longer wing chords. 
Several differences are seen among the subspecies. For &quot;T. l. ludovicianus&quot;, the crown is rich brown that appears more chestnut-colored on its rump and upper tail coverts. Shoulders and greater coverts are a rich brown, with a series of small white dots on the lesser primary coverts. The secondary coverts are rich brown with a darker brown barring on both webs; the bars on the primaries are on the outerwebs only, but darker and more noticeable. The rectrices are brown with 18 to 20 bars that span across the tail. The white supercilious streak borders thinly with a black above and below, and extends above and beyond its shoulders. The ear coverts are speckled gray and grayish-black. Its chin and throat are grey that becomes buff on its chest, flank and belly, though the latter two are of a warmer color. The underwing coverts sport a grayish buff color. Its iris is reddish-brown, the upper mandible is lemon-colored and paler at the base and lower mandible. The legs are flesh-colored.

As for the other subspecies in contrast to &quot;T. l. ludovicianus&quot;, &quot;T. l. berlandieri&quot; is of a slightly smaller build, but possesses a larger bill, the upperparts are duller brown with deeper colored underparts, &quot;T. l. lomitensis&quot; is of a duller color (than either &quot;ludovicianus&quot; or &quot;berlandieri&quot;) with its underparts either pale or almost white, &quot;T. l. miamensis&quot; contains darker rusty chestnut upperparts and deeper colored below. &quot;T. l. burleighi&quot; is duller and sootier with less distinct tail markings, &quot;T. l. mesophilus&quot; has paler underparts and a whiter supercilium, and &quot;T. l. tropicalis&quot; is darker than all races, and contains heavier bars than &quot;T. l. berlandieri&quot;.

===Plumage===
The juvenile &quot;T.l. ludovicianus&quot; is similar in appearance, but the plumage is generally paler; a softer texture, buff-tipped wing coverts, and a paler superciliary streak. In August and September, the partial plumage molt for the post-juvenile wrens is darker in color and affects the contour plumage, wing coverts, tail and develops a whiter superciliary stripe. The post-nuptial molt for adults in the same time period is more pronounced in color than the spring molt, with both sexes similar in appearance.

===Life span===

Survival rates differ by region. A male captured in Arkansas lived to be at least 73 months old, and in Alabama, the oldest female and male captured were six and ten years old, respectively. In a survival probability mark-and-recapture study conducted within the Southeastern United States from 1992 to 2003, roughly 90 percent of the banded wrens died within 10 years.

===Similar species===
The easiest species to confuse with the Carolina wren is Bewick&#x27;s wren, which differs in being smaller but with a longer tail, grayer-brown above and whiter below. The Carolina and white-browed wrens differ from the house wren in being larger, with a decidedly longer bill and hind toe; their culmen has a notch behind the tip.

==Habitat and distribution==

These birds are largely resident, and will only disperse beyond their range after mild winters. Carolina wrens sporadically breed as far north as Maine and Quebec after mild winters. In certain parts of their range, such as most of Iowa, prolonged periods of snow can curtail potential expansion. Permanent breeding locations range from eastern Nebraska, southern Michigan, southeast Ontario and the New England states to Mexican states such as Coahuila, Nuevo León, San Luis Potosí and Tamaulipas and the Gulf Coast of the United States. Local occurrences with infrequent and likely breeding locations include southeast South Dakota, central Kansas, eastern Colorado, western Oklahoma and Texas as far as Maine and New Brunswick. There have been occasional vagrants spotted in Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

The range of the wrens increased northward and westward in several regions over the past few centuries. In Massachusetts, the wrens had expanded westward and northeastward from its former southeastern location in approximately 35 years, in New York the population increased three-fold in roughly 25 years, while in the midwest states of Ohio and Michigan, numbers have increased since the mid-1800s and early 1900s, respectively. Expansion around Ontario occurred since early reports in 1890 and 1905. Explanations given include infrequent winter storms in the 20th century, expanded forest habitats, and the wrens taking advantage of urban areas containing feeders, especially in winter. From 1966 to 2015 the Carolina wren experienced a greater than 1.5% annual population increase throughout most of its northern range, extending from southern Maine to southern Nebraska.

Carolina wrens adapt to various habitats. Natural habitats include various types of woodland such as oak hardwoods and mixed oak-pine woodlands, ash and elmwoods, hickory-oak woodlands with a healthy amount of tangled undergrowth. The preferred habitats are riparian forest, brushy edges, swamps, overgrown farmland, and suburban yards with abundant thick shrubs and trees, and parks. It has an affinity for dilapidated buildings and unkempt yards in man-made areas. Subspecies &quot;burleighi&quot; and &quot;neophilus&quot; inhabit slash pine and palmettos.

==Behavior==

===Song and calls===

Carolina wrens sing year round and at any point during the daytime, with the exception of performing during the most harsh weather conditions. Males alone sing, and have a repertoire of at least twenty different phrase patterns and on average, thirty two. One of these patterns is repeated for several minutes, and although the male&#x27;s song can be repeated up to twelve times, the general number of songs range from three to five times in repetition. While singing, the tail of the birds is pointed downward. Some general vocalizations have been transcribed as &quot;teakettle-teakettle-teakettle&quot; and &quot;cheery-cheery-cheery&quot;. Various descriptions of the &quot;teakettle&quot; song include &quot;whee-udel, whee-udel, whee-udel&quot;, &quot;che-wortel, che-wortel&quot; and &quot;túrtee-túrtee-túrtee&quot; and familiar names and phrases such as &quot;sweet heart, sweet heart&quot;, &quot;come to me, come to me&quot;, &quot;sweet William&quot;, and &quot;Richelieu, Richelieu&quot;.

Males are capable of increasing their repertoire through song learning, but due to their sedentary nature and territorial defense habits, the song learning must occur within the first three months of life. Geographic barriers affect song repertoire size from male wrens, as one study indicated that distances separated as close as by water barriers can have the same effect as that of a distance of in the mainland with no barriers.

Female Carolina wrens possess song control regions that would appear to make them capable of singing with repertoires like the male. Due to vocalizations that they occasionally make with the male, it has been suggested that song perception plays a role and is of behavioral relevance.
Different subspecies have variations in songs and calls, such as &quot;miamensis&quot; having a more rapid song that contains more notes than the races that are further north.

Their songs can be confused with the Kentucky warbler. The song patterns are similar, but the warbler&#x27;s songs are described as richer, with more ringing and a hurried pace. Other bird species with songs described as akin to the wren are the flicker, Baltimore oriole, grey catbird, and more specifically the &quot;peto, peto, peto&quot; call of the tufted titmouse and the whistle of the northern cardinal. Occasionally, the wrens mimic other species; in Pennsylvania this trait has caused the bird to be also known as the &#x27;mocking wren&#x27;.

===Sexual selection===
A 2006 study suggested that the correlation of tail length and body size in males, wing length in females, and lifespan for both sexes were signs of individual quality, and the wrens of high quality tend to mate with like individuals. The courting and antagonistic encounters that involve the tail fanning and wing drooping was suggested to be a possible signaling use. Age and life experience are not thought of as significant for potential mates due to their relatively short lifespan and sedentary lifestyle. Due to the large size of male wrens and the male&#x27;s vigor in defending its territory, intrasexual selection was given as a possible explanation for the sexual dimorphism.

===Territorial and predator defense===
Both sexes are involved in defending the territory. One aspect of territorial defense involves identifying the proximity of the threat based on the loudness of bird song as well as the level of degradation of the calls. In experiments involving playback, the wrens are capable of discriminating between degraded and undegraded songs, as well as degraded songs in the same acoustic conditions, and can detect changes of acoustic properties within their territories, such as songs under foliage. Song degradation can also be used to determine the proximity of potential intruders. If the song of a bird appears to be degraded, the wrens will assume that the threat is distant and not respond; if the song is not degraded, they respond by attacking. Not all birds within their territory are potential enemies. Some species of birds that are neighbors are designated as dear enemies by the wrens, and the responses to neighbors and intruders in their territories differ by the season. In spring, the wrens respond more aggressively toward neighbors, though in the fall, no major discrepancy in responses is shown. When protecting their nest, alarm calls are the general response. The wrens judge the size of the potential threat, such as a blue jay and avoid the risk of injury when attacking. Countersinging produced by intruder birds is more likely to be taken as an aggressive threat to male Carolina wrens.

Both males and females utilize calls in alarm situations, especially in territorial disputes and encounters with predators. Males alone produce the &quot;cheer&quot; call, which can sound indistinct. In southern regions of their range, the sound males use in alarm disputes is a ringing &quot;pink&quot; or &quot;p&#x27;dink&quot; sound. Females are the only ones that can perform the paired &quot;dit-dit&quot; or chatter sounds. The former can be used in territorial disputes with predators, and with at least northern populations the songs are used in alternation with the males &quot;cheer&quot; chant. The chatter is used exclusively with territorial encounters with male song, and the song can either follow or overlap her mate&#x27;s song.

===Feeding===
Carolina wrens spend the majority of their time on or near the ground searching for food, or in tangles of vegetation and vines. They also probe bark crevices on lower tree levels, or pick up leaf-litter in order to search for prey. Their diet consists of invertebrates, such as beetles, true bugs, grasshoppers, katydids, spiders, ants, bees, and wasps. Small lizards and tree frogs also make up the carnivorous portion of their diet. Vegetable matter, such as fruit pulp and various seeds, makes up a small percentage of their diet. In the northern portion of their range, they frequent bird feeders.

===Movement===
Carolina wrens are wary, and are more often heard than seen. When on the ground, they move in jerky hops pillaging through various objects, whether man-made or natural. While moving abruptly, they pause momentarily for chattering or singing. When stationary, they move in twitched motions, jerking their breast around. They also sun- or sand-bathe. The wrens also displays a skittish behavior when encountered by humans, as they can be seen thrusting off into cover slowly if approaching is detected. However, they occasionally seek out humans that are near, so long as there is no movement from them. Other movements involve being capable of crawling like a creeper and hanging upside-down like a nuthatch.

Flights are generally of short duration, rapid, low-leveled, and wavelike. The wings during flight are flapped rapidly, and are frequently used during foraging. They are also capable of flying vertically from the base of a tree to the top in a single wing assisted bound.

===Breeding===

Carolina wrens are both genetically and socially monogamous and will usually mate for life. Mate changing is rare, and there has been one possible observation of polygamy. During the winter season, males are more responsible for guarding the territory. Females vary in succeeding to maintain winter territories without a mate. It has been suggested that the possibility of desertion and decline in care-taking from males along with the need for security in resources year-round prevent extra pair copulations from females, as the mortality rate for Carolina wrens peaks during the winter. Along with thermoregulatory benefits, roosting is thought to reinforce pair-bonding and prevent divorce between mates.

The nests are arch-shaped structures with a side entrance and built of dried plants or strips of bark, as well as horsehair, string, wool and snake sloughs. The male obtains nesting materials while the female remains at the site to construct the nest. Nests are located in fragmented or complete cavities in trees, or in man-made structures such as bird-boxes, buildings, tin cans, mailboxes or unorthodox places such as pockets of hanging jackets in sheds or in a tractor in everyday use. Nests are from from the ground and are rarely higher. They occasionally can be built in sloping locations or at ground level.

Egg laying dates and clutch size vary by region; in Texas the time period is from late February to late August, in Iowa it ranges from late April to June. The clutch size is generally 3 to 6 eggs, but can reach as high as seven in Texas. The eggs are creamy white with brown or reddish-brown spots, and are more heavily marked at the broad end. The eggs are incubated by the female for 12–16 days. After the young hatch, they are fed exclusively on invertebrates and they fledge in 12–14 days. As many as three broods may be raised by a pair in a single breeding season. In one study, three of the 70 fledglings remained or defended territory adjacent to the natal area.

Male and females are involved in the process of provisioning at similar rates throughout most nest stages, with the males providing slightly more in the nestling stages. Both sexes increase their provision rates as the nestlings grow in age.

==Predation and threats==
Although Carolina wrens are fairly common, brood parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird is common, with up to 25% of Carolina wren nests being affected in certain regions such as Oklahoma and Alabama. Cowbird parasitism peaks in April at 41%, and is as low as 8% and 0% in July and August, respectively. Female cowbirds sometimes eject Carolina wren eggs before laying their own, and even if host eggs are retained, the size of cowbird eggs negatively affect the hatching success of wren eggs. As a result, cowbirds may have a significant impact on the reproductive success of wrens. The feeding rate for cowbird nestlings is higher than wren feeding rates, and some have been raised to independence. This also can be detrimental to the survival of wren nestlings. A rare instance of brood-parasitism by a house finch has been recorded. The rate of brood parasitism is thought to be lower in more natural and concealed nesting locations. Body parasites such as the larvae of blowflies feed on nestlings and the blood loss weakens nestlings. Fellow species of wren such as Bewick&#x27;s wren and the winter wren compete for nesting locations and food, respectively.

In Virginia, some Carolina wrens populations show high levels of mercury in their blood and this is acquired from feeding all-year-round on spiders. Spiders being at a higher trophic level contain a higher concentrations of mercury (through biomagnification) than herbivorous invertebrates. As these wrens are year-round residents, they are at a higher risk than other species to acquire mercury in their blood. Nest abandonment and failure to raise young are more common with higher mercury content. Exposure, and prolonged periods of cold, ice, and snow is thought to affect the wren nestling and adult populations, respectively. Wrens that outlast those winters reside in sheltered areas during the season.

Among the top predators of adult Carolina wrens are domestic cats, and snakes such as the timber rattlesnake. Raccoons and black rat snakes also feed on wren eggs and nestlings.

==In culture==

In 1930, the South Carolina Federated Women&#x27;s club adopted the Carolina wren as the unofficial state bird over the eastern mourning dove and pushed for its official state adoption until 1939, when the South Carolina Legislature named the northern mockingbird as the state bird. In 1948, the legislature repealed their previous decision, and the wren became the official state bird.

In 2000, the Carolina wren was featured on the back of the South Carolina edition of the 50 State Quarters.

<text>Luohu District is a district of Shenzhen, China, located north of the New Territories of Hong Kong, east of Futian District, southeast of Longgang District, southwest of Pingshan District, and west of Yantian District. It is one of the oldest parts of the city, having represented Shenzhen as a fishing village before 1953 and a market town from 1953 to 1979, when Bao&#x27;an County was promoted to a prefecture-level city and renamed Shenzhen.

==History==
Prior to the establishment of Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SEZ), an original town called Shenzhen (or Shum Chun; Sham Chun) Hui () was located within the current Luohu district. It was of size 350,000 m2 and has a population of little less than 30,000. The town centred at the present-day Dongmen, where a Tin Hau Temple once stood.

The name Shenzhen was first mentioned in 1410 though the town was only first documented in 1688 but was believed to be inhabited long before this. The market town prospered and expanded out of its boundaries in the early 20th century, following the completion of the Kowloon–Canton Railway, which the town was a stopping station. The town was occupied by Japanese forces between 1942 and 1945. It was promoted from market town to an official town status in 1950. In 1953, the administrative centre of San On County was moved to Shum Chun from Nantou.

After Shenzhen was promoted to city status in October 1979, Luohu district was established as the first district in Shenzhen. Several small mountains were flattened to facilitate its infrastructure during initial construction phases. In November 1997, Yantian area became an independent administrative district.

Some of the tallest and most recognizable buildings in Shenzhen, including Shun Hing Square, KK100 and the Guomao Building are located within the district.
==Geography==
The size of Luohu district is about and contains 10 subdistricts.

Luohu is located in the southern part of Shenzhen, with Futian district on its west, Yantian district on its east, and Longgang district on its north. The Shenzhen River, which separates the district from North District, Hong Kong forms its southern limits.

It is also one of the six administrative districts of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SEZ) of Shenzhen City of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Luohu has an uneven geography and contains a number of natural fresh water sources, including Donghu (), Honghu (), and Xianhu (), among others. Shuiku (), or &quot;Water Reservoir&quot;, is also located in Luohu and is an important source of water for both Shenzhen and Hong Kong.

Shenzhen&#x27;s highest peak, Wutong Mountain (944m) () is in Luohu District.

The district&#x27;s west boundary with Futian is Hongling Road, and its east boundary with Yantian is Wutong Mountain.

<text>In image processing and photography, a color histogram is a representation of the distribution of colors in an image. For digital images, a color histogram represents the number of pixels that have colors in each of a fixed list of color ranges, that span the image&#x27;s color space, the set of all possible colors.

The color histogram can be built for any kind of color space, although the term is more often used for three-dimensional spaces such as RGB or HSV. For monochromatic images, the term intensity histogram may be used instead. For multi-spectral images, where each pixel is represented by an arbitrary number of measurements (for example, beyond the three measurements in RGB), the color histogram is &quot;N&quot;-dimensional, with N being the number of measurements taken. Each measurement has its own wavelength range of the light spectrum, some of which may be outside the visible spectrum.

If the set of possible color values is sufficiently small, each of those colors may be placed on a range by itself; then the histogram is merely the count of pixels that have each possible color. Most often, the space is divided into an appropriate number of ranges, often arranged as a regular grid, each containing many similar color values. The color histogram may also be represented and displayed as a smooth function defined over the color space that approximates the pixel counts.

Like other kinds of histograms, the color histogram is a statistic that can be viewed as an approximation of an underlying continuous distribution of color values.

==Overview==

Color histograms are flexible constructs that can be built from images in various color spaces, whether RGB, rg chromaticity or any other color space of any dimension. A histogram of an image is produced first by discretization of the colors in the image into a number of bins, and counting the number of image pixels in each bin. For example, a Red–Blue chromaticity histogram can be formed by first normalizing color pixel values by dividing RGB values by R+G+B, then quantizing the normalized R and B coordinates into N bins each. A two-dimensional histogram of Red-Blue chromaticity divided into four bins (&quot;N&quot;=4) might yield a histogram that looks like this table:

A histogram can be N-dimensional. Although harder to display, a three-dimensional color histogram for the above example could be thought of as four separate Red-Blue histograms, where each of the four histograms contains the Red-Blue values for a bin of green (0-63, 64-127, 128-191, and 192-255).

The histogram provides a compact summarization of the distribution of data in an image. The color histogram of an image is relatively invariant with translation and rotation about the viewing axis, and varies only slowly with the angle of view. By comparing histogram signatures of two images and matching the color content of one image with the other, the color histogram is particularly well suited for the problem of recognizing an object of unknown position and rotation within a scene. Importantly, translation of an RGB image into the illumination invariant rg-chromaticity space allows the histogram to operate well in varying light levels.

1. What is a histogram?

A histogram is a graphical representation of the number of pixels in an image. In a more simple way to explain, a histogram is a bar graph, whose X-axis represents the tonal scale(black at the left and white at the right), and Y-axis represents the number of pixels in an image in a certain area of the tonal scale. For example, the graph of a luminance histogram shows the number of pixels for each brightness level(from black to white), and when there are more pixels, the peak at the certain luminance level is higher.

2. What is a color histogram?

A color histogram of an image represents the distribution of the composition of colors in the image. It shows different types of colors appeared and the number of pixels in each type of the colors appeared. The relation between a color histogram and a luminance histogram is that a color histogram can be also expressed as “Three Luminance Histograms”, each of which shows the brightness distribution of each individual Red/Green/Blue color channel.

==Characteristics of a color histogram==

A color histogram focuses only on the proportion of the number of different types of colors, regardless of the spatial location of the colors. The values of a color histogram are from statistics. They show the statistical distribution of colors and the essential tone of an image.

In general, as the color distributions of the foreground and background in an image are different, there might be a bimodal distribution in the histogram.

For the luminance histogram alone, there is no perfect histogram and in general, the histogram can tell whether it is over-exposure or not, but there are times when you might think the image is over exposed by viewing the histogram; however, in reality it is not.

==Principles of the formation of a color histogram==

The formation of a color histogram is rather simple. From the definition above, we can simply count the number of pixels for each 256 scales in each of the 3 RGB channel, and plot them on 3 individual bar graphs.

In general, a color histogram is based on a certain color space, such as RGB or HSV. When we compute the pixels of different colors in an image, if the color space is large, then we can first divide the color space into certain numbers of small intervals. Each of the intervals is called a bin. This process is called color quantization. Then, by counting the number of pixels in each of the bins, we get the color histogram of the image.

The concrete steps of the principles can be viewed in Example 1.

==Examples==

===Example 1===

Given the following image of a cat (an original version and a version that has been reduced to 256 colors for easy histogram purposes), the following data represents a color histogram in the RGB color space, using four bins. 

Bin 0 corresponds to intensities 0-63 

Bin 1 is 64-127 

Bin 2 is 128-191 and Bin 3 is 192-255.



===Example 2===



Application in camera:

Nowadays, some cameras have the ability to show the 3 color histograms when we take photos. 

We can examine clips (spikes on either the black or white side of the scale) in each of the 3 RGB color histograms. If we find one or more clipping on a channel of the 3 RGB channels, then this would result in a loss of detail for that color.

To illustrate this, consider this example:

1. We know that each of the three R, G, B channels has a range of values from 0-255 (8 bit). So consider a photo that has a luminance range of 0-255.

2. Assume the photo we take is made of 4 blocks that are adjacent to each other and we set the luminance scale for each of the 4 blocks of original photo to be 10, 100, 205, 245. Thus, the image looks like the topmost figure on the right. 

3. Then, we overexpose the photo a little, say, the luminance scale of each block is increased by 10. Thus, the luminance scale for each of the 4 blocks of new photo is 20, 110, 215, 255. Then, the image looks like the second figure on the right.

There is not much difference between both figures, all we can see is that the whole image becomes brighter (the contrast for each of the blocks remain the same).

4. Now, we overexpose the original photo again, this time the luminance scale of each block is increased by 50. Thus, the luminance scale for each of the 4 blocks of the new photo is 60, 150, 255, 255. The new image now looks like the third figure on the right.

Note that the scale for the last block is 255 instead of 295, for 255 is the top scale and thus the last block has clipped! When this happens, we lose the contrast of the last 2 blocks, and thus, we cannot recover the image no matter how we adjust it.

To conclude, when taking photos with a camera that displays histograms, always keep the brightest tone in the image below the largest scale 255 on the histogram in order to avoid losing details.

==Drawbacks and other approaches==

The main drawback of histograms for classification is that the representation is dependent on the color of the object being studied, ignoring its shape and texture. Color histograms can potentially be identical for two images with different object content which happens to share color information. Conversely, without spatial or shape information, similar objects of different color may be indistinguishable based solely on color histogram comparisons. There is no way to distinguish a red and white cup from a red and white plate. Put it another way: histogram-based algorithms have no concept of a generic &#x27;cup&#x27;, and a model of a red and white cup is no use when given an otherwise identical blue and white cup. Another problem is that color histograms have high sensitivity to noisy interference such as lighting intensity changes and quantization errors. High dimensionality (bins) color histograms are also another issue. Some color histogram feature spaces often occupy more than one hundred dimensions.

Some of the proposed solutions have been color histogram intersection, color constant indexing, cumulative color histogram, quadratic distance, and color correlograms. Although there are drawbacks of using histograms for indexing and classification, using color in a real-time system has several advantages. One is that color information is faster to compute compared to other invariants. It has been shown in some cases that color can be an efficient method for identifying objects of known location and appearance.

Further research into the relationship between color histogram data to the physical properties of the objects in an image has shown they can represent not only object color and illumination but relate to surface roughness and image geometry and provide an improved estimate of illumination and object color.

Usually, Euclidean distance, histogram intersection, or cosine or quadratic distances are used for the calculation of image similarity ratings. Any of these values do not reflect the similarity rate of two images in itself; it is useful only when used in comparison to other similar values. This is the reason that all the practical implementations of content-based image retrieval must complete computation of all images from the database, and is the main disadvantage of these implementations.

Another approach to representative color image content is two-dimensional color histogram. A two-dimensional color histogram considers the relation between the pixel pair colors (not only the lighting component). A two-dimensional color histogram is a two-dimensional array. The size of each dimension is the number of colors that were used in the phase of color quantization. These arrays are treated as matrices, each element of which stores a normalized count of pixel pairs, with each color corresponding to the index of an element in each pixel neighborhood. For comparison of two-dimensional color histograms it is suggested calculating their correlation, because constructed as described above, is a random vector (in other words, a multi-dimensional random value). While creating a set of final images, the images should be arranged in decreasing order of the correlation coefficient.

The correlation coefficient may also be used for color histogram comparison. Retrieval results with correlation coefficient are better than with other metrics.

==Intensity histogram of continuous data==

The idea of an intensity histogram can be generalized to continuous data,
say audio signals represented by real functions or images represented by functions with two-dimensional domain.

Let formula_1 (see Lebesgue space), then the cumulative histogram operator formula_2 can be defined by:
:formula_3.
formula_4 is the Lebesgue measure of sets.
formula_5 in turn is a real function.
The (non-cumulative) histogram is defined as its derivative.
:formula_6.

<text>Forrest Grady &quot;Spec&quot; Towns (February 6, 1914 – April 9, 1991) was an American track and field athlete. He was the 1936 Olympic champion in the 110 m hurdles and broke the world record in that event three times.

Born in Fitzgerald, Georgia, Towns grew up in Augusta, Georgia, where he played football in high school at Richmond Academy. In 1933, he earned a football scholarship to the University of Georgia (UGA) after a sports journalist had seen him high jumping in his backyard.

Rather than high jumping, Towns specialized in the high hurdles, winning NCAA and AAU titles in the 120 y hurdles event in 1935. It was the beginning of a 60 race winning streak, lasting until 1937.

In 1936, Towns was named to the American Olympic team, becoming the first Georgian to achieve this. During the Olympics in Berlin, Germany, Towns became the world record holder with 14.1, and he won the Olympic gold in 14.2. Also, he became the first Georgian to earn Olympic Gold. Shortly after the Games, he became the first hurdler under 14 seconds. At a race in Oslo, he dramatically improved the world record to 13.7 – a time that would stand until 1950.

After college, Towns became head track and field coach at his alma mater, Georgia, a position he held until 1975. In 1991, he died of a heart attack in Athens, Georgia at age 77. He was honored at the University with the naming of the Spec Towns Track, and an annual meet called the Spec Towns Invitational.

Towns was the official starter for the first-ever Peachtree Road Race on July 4, 1970.

<doc id="474832" wikidata="Q1537957" url="?curid=474832" title="Gordie Howe hat trick">
<text>A Gordie Howe hat trick is a variation on ice hockey&#x27;s hat-trick. It is accomplished when a player collects a goal, an assist, and a fight in the same game. It is named after Hall of Famer Gordie Howe.

The term was coined by a 1950s New York sportswriter, although Howe himself accomplished the feat only twice in his five-decade career. Howe&#x27;s son Marty once remarked, &quot;The Gordie Howe hat trick should really be a goal, an assist and a cross-check to the face. That might be more accurate.&quot;

==Incidents==
The first known Gordie Howe hat trick was achieved by Hockey Hall of Fame defenceman Harry Cameron of the Toronto Arenas on December 26, 1917, in a 7–5 win against the Montreal Canadiens.

Howe himself accomplished his first Gordie Howe hat trick on October 11, 1953, when he scored a goal, assisted on Red Kelly&#x27;s goal, and fought the Toronto Maple Leafs&#x27; Fernie Flaman. The second occurrence was on March 21, 1954, once again versus the Maple Leafs. Howe scored the opening goal, assisted on two Ted Lindsay goals, and fought Ted &quot;Teeder&quot; Kennedy.

===Multiples===
The &quot;Double Gordie&quot;, involving two players who each tallied a goal, an assist, and fought each other, has occurred on five occasions:
* On April 9, 1981 Brad Park (who recorded 1G, 3A) fought Bobby Smith (who recorded 1G, 1A)
* On March 9, 2010, Fedor Tyutin (who recorded 1G, 2A) fought Ryan Getzlaf (who recorded 1G, 1A) 
* On January 10, 2012, Adam Henrique (who recorded 1G, 1A) fought Jarome Iginla (who recorded 1G, 2A)
* On October 30, 2023 Liam O&#x27;Brien (who recorded 1G, 1A) fought Nick Foligno, and Jack McBain (who recorded 2G, 2A) fought Jarred Tinordi (the first time in 35 years that 2 players of the same team got a Gordie Howe hat trick)
* On October 9, 2024 J. T. Miller (who recorded 1G, 1A) fought Anthony Mantha (who recorded 1G, 1A) 

In the April 9, 1981 playoff game between the Minnesota North Stars and the Boston Bruins where Brad Park and Bobby Smith completed a Double Gordie, Bryan Maxwell also completed a Gordie Howe Hat Trick of his own. The North Stars won the game 9–6.

===Debut variations===
A Gordie Howe hat trick that included a player&#x27;s first NHL goal occurred on November 19, 2014, when Steve Pinizzotto was called up by the Edmonton Oilers and he made his 2014–15 season debut against his previous team, the Vancouver Canucks.

On December 29, 2018, Tyler Lewington of the Washington Capitals, playing in just his second career NHL game, against the Ottawa Senators, became the only player to complete a Gordie Howe hat trick with all three components being NHL career firsts, including his first assist on a goal by Tom Wilson and his first fight against Zack Smith.

===Consecutive days===
Doug Risebrough of the Montreal Canadiens became the first NHL player to register a Gordie Howe hat trick on consecutive days, on February 15 and 16, 1975, both games against the Chicago Black Hawks. Jacob Trouba of the New York Rangers became the second to do it on December 7, 2021 against the Blackhawks and the following night against the Colorado Avalanche.

===Women&#x27;s hockey===
Tereza Vanišová of the Ottawa Charge was the first woman to record a Gordie Howe hat trick in the Professional Women&#x27;s Hockey League (PWHL). She recorded the feat in a game against the Boston Fleet on February 20, 2025. Her fight against Jill Saulnier only resulted in a roughing penalty, but was considered to be the first fight in PWHL history. Vanišová&#x27;s goal was is in the dying seconds of regulation, tying the game 2–2. The team went on to lose in overtime.

==Leaders==
Although he played a record 2,421 professional hockey games, Gordie Howe himself achieved only two &quot;Gordie Howe hat tricks&quot; in his NHL career.

The all-time leaders in Gordie Howe hat tricks are Rick Tocchet with 18 and Brendan Shanahan (who would later become the NHL&#x27;s chief disciplinarian) with 17. Next is Brian Sutter with 16, then Tiger Williams and Wilf Paiement with 15 each.

<doc id="474834" wikidata="Q674738" url="?curid=474834" title="Greensleeves">
<text>&quot;Greensleeves&quot; is a traditional English folk song. A broadside ballad by the name &quot;A Newe Northen Dittye of ye Ladye Greene Sleves&quot; was registered by Richard Jones at the London Stationers&#x27; Company in September 1580, and the tune is found in several late 16th-century and early 17th-century sources, such as &quot;Ballet&#x27;s MS Lute Book&quot; and &quot;Het Luitboek van Thysius&quot;, as well as various manuscripts preserved in the Seeley Historical Library in the University of Cambridge.

==Origin==
A broadside ballad by this name was registered at the London Stationer&#x27;s Company in September 1580, by Richard Jones, as &quot;A Newe Northen Dittye of ye Ladye Greene Sleves&quot;. Six more ballads followed in less than a year, one on the same day, 3 September 1580 (&quot;Ye Ladie Greene Sleeves answere to Donkyn hir frende&quot; by Edward White), then on 15 and 18 September (by Henry Carr and again by White), 14 December (Richard Jones again), 13 February 1581 (Wiliam Elderton), and August 1581 (White&#x27;s third contribution, &quot;Greene Sleeves is worne awaie, Yellow Sleeves Comme to decaie, Blacke Sleeves I holde in despite, But White Sleeves is my delighte&quot;). It then appears in the surviving &quot;A Handful of Pleasant Delights&quot; (1584) as &quot;A New Courtly Sonnet of the Lady Green Sleeves. To the new tune of Green Sleeves&quot;.

It is a common myth that Greensleeves was written by King Henry VIII. However, Henry did not write Greensleeves as the piece is based on an Italian style of composition that did not reach England until after his death.

==Lyrical interpretation==
A possible interpretation of the lyrics is that Lady Green Sleeves was a promiscuous young woman, perhaps even a prostitute. At the time, the word &quot;green&quot; had sexual connotations, most notably in the phrase &quot;a green gown&quot;, a reference to the grass stains on a woman&#x27;s dress from engaging in sexual intercourse outdoors.

An alternative explanation is that Lady Green Sleeves was, through her costume, incorrectly assumed to be sexually promiscuous. Her &quot;discourteous&quot; rejection of the singer&#x27;s advances supports the contention that she is not.

In Nevill Coghill&#x27;s translation of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, he explains that &quot;green [for Chaucer&#x27;s age] was the colour of lightness in love. This is echoed in &#x27;Greensleeves is my delight&#x27; and elsewhere.&quot;

===Alternative lyrics===
Christmas and New Year texts were associated with the tune from as early as 1686, and by the 19th century almost every printed collection of Christmas carols included some version of words and music together, most of them ending with the refrain &quot;On Christmas Day in the morning&quot;. One of the most popular of these is &quot;What Child Is This?&quot;, written in 1865 by William Chatterton Dix.

==Early literary references==
In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; (written c. 1597; first published in 1602), the character Mistress Ford refers twice to &quot;the tune of &#x27;Greensleeves&#x27;&quot;, and Falstaff later exclaims:

These allusions indicate the song was already well known at that time.

==Form==

&quot;Greensleeves&quot; can have a ground either of the form called a &quot;romanesca&quot;; or its slight variant, the &quot;passamezzo antico&quot;; or the &quot;passamezzo antico&quot; in its verses and the &quot;romanesca&quot; in its reprise; or of the Andalusian progression in its verses and the &quot;romanesca&quot; or &quot;passamezzo antico&quot; in its reprise. The romanesca originated in Spain and is composed of a sequence of four chords with a simple, repeating bass, which provide the groundwork for variations and improvisation.

==Uses==

* The tune was used (as &quot;My Lady Greensleeves&quot;) as the slow march of the London Trained Bands in the 16th and 17th centuries. Later the 7th (City of London) Battalion London Regiment, which claimed descent from the Yellow Regiment of London Trained Bands, adopted the tune as its quick march during World War I, replacing &quot;Austria&quot; (to the same tune as the Imperial Austria Anthem), which had been used until then.
* Greensleeves is the tune for the classic Christmas carol What Child Is This?.
* The 17th century English ballad, &quot;Old England Grown New&quot; is a version of &quot;Greensleeves&quot;, also sometimes known as &#x27;The Blacksmith&#x27; after another broadside ballad of the time.
* Ralph Vaughan Williams incorporated &quot;Greensleeves&quot; as the song &quot;Alas, My Love, You Do Me Wrong&quot; for Mistress Ford in Act III of his 1928 opera &quot;Sir John in Love&quot;. Its contrasting middle section is founded on another folk tune: &quot;Lovely Joan&quot;. In 1934 the song was arranged for strings and harp, with Vaughan Williams&#x27;s blessing, by Ralph Greaves (1889–1966); this is the familiar &quot;Fantasia on Greensleeves&quot;.
* Gustav Holst incorporated the tune into the final movement of his Second Suite in F for Military Band, interwoven with the primary theme, &quot;Dargason&quot;. He later adapted the movement for strings, still using both folk tunes, in his St Paul&#x27;s Suite.
* The tune was the basis for &quot;Home in the Meadow&quot;, a recurring song throughout the 1962 epic film &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;.
* In the United Kingdom, the &quot;Greensleeves&quot; tune is popular as a standard chime for ice cream vans.
* Belgian singer Jacques Brel used the tune for the basis of his 1964 song Amsterdam.
* Instrumental versions of &quot;Greensleeves&quot; were used in the long-running original &quot;Lassie&quot; television series, both in a seven-part 1966 story and as the show&#x27;s theme song for its last three seasons (1970–73).
* Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen includes an adaptation of the song, titled &quot;Leaving Green Sleeves&quot; in his 1974 album New Skin for the Old Ceremony, in which the chord progression and lyrical content of the first two verses are retained.
* The melody of &quot;Greensleeves&quot; is used repeatedly as a motif in SIX, a musical about the wives of Henry VIII.
* In Hong Kong, &quot;Greensleeves&quot; is used as background music in the listening tests of the city&#x27;s university entrance exams, the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination.
* In Hong Kong, upon the opening of the MTR&#x27;s Tuen Ma line in 2021, a video of a young rail enthusiast singing the lyrics &quot;I&#x27;m really excited about the opening of Tuen Ma line&quot; to the tune of &quot;Greensleeves&quot; became a viral internet meme. The MTR created its own edition of the song for the extension of the East Rail line in 2022.
* In Mr. Sunshine, a Korean drama, this music is used on several occasions.

<text>The Limehouse Link tunnel is a long tunnel under Limehouse in East London on the A1203 road. The tunnel links the eastern end of The Highway to Canary Wharf in London Docklands. Built between 1989 and 1993 at a cost of £293,000,000 it has been calculated as the most expensive road scheme in Britain per mile, working out at £50,500 per foot at 2011 prices. It is the second largest non-estuarial road tunnel in the UK, after the Hindhead Tunnel in Surrey.

==History==
During the early 1980s, it was clear that the existing road infrastructure serving the Isle of Dogs development zone had no spare capacity, and the Limehouse Link formed the western part of improvements proposed by the London Docklands Development Corporation. Planning started in 1986, the designers were Sir Alexander Gibb &amp; Partners. The design of the tunnel approaches and portal buildings was carried out by Anthony Meats and Rooney O&#x27;Carroll Architects as part of an overall consultancy on the LDDC highway infrastructure programme. Construction began in November 1989 and the tunnel project was officially opened in May 1993. At the time it was the second biggest engineering project in Europe after the Channel Tunnel.

==Construction==
Balfour Beatty and Amec formed a joint venture to build the tunnel. Called &#x27;Balfour Beatty Fairclough Joint Venture&#x27;, the project involved five million man hours over 193 weeks.

==Description==
The tunnel is actually twin parallel tunnels built by the cut-and-cover method, with the tunnels under waterways built bottom-up behind temporary cofferdam walls. The western portal of the tunnel is at the eastern end of The Highway (A1203), just east of its junction with Butcher Row. The access roads from the Highway into the tunnel run adjacent to the access roads to the Rotherhithe Tunnel for a short distance; the northern portal of that tunnel lies just north of the Link tunnel entrance. Heading east, the tunnel passes under the north side of Limehouse Basin, turns south-east to pass underneath Limekiln Dock and Dundee Wharf close to the embankment walls of the River Thames before turning north-east under Westferry Road. The eastern portal to the tunnel, emerging onto the A1261 Aspen Way, is just north of the Canary Wharf development, near West India Quay DLR station. Through the Blackwall area, the eastern extremity of Aspen Way includes a flyover crossing of a roundabout close to the line of the twin tunnels of the Blackwall Tunnel.

The tunnel has a speed limit, enforced by SpeedCurb speed cameras above the carriageway at the tunnel entrances, exits and inside the tunnel.

The Limehouse Link tunnel is notable for including slip roads to and from Westferry Road towards the eastern end of the twin tunnels. Complex ground conditions and the need to avoid several key existing structures including other tunnels and a river basin increased costs.

New radio and loudspeaker public address systems were installed in early 2008.

===Art===

The tunnel structures feature substantial works of public art. The western portal has Zadok Ben-David&#x27;s circle of silhouettes, &quot;Restless Dream&quot;. The eastern portal has an untitled abstract by Nigel Hall. The eastern services building (Westferry Road) has artwork commissioned from UK artist and sculptor Michael Kenny (1941–1999), a relief work in Kilkenny limestone called &quot;On Strange And Distant Islands&quot;.

===Sport===
The tunnel is closed to road traffic and used by runners in The Big Half, an annual half marathon held on a Sunday morning in early September.

<doc id="474843" wikidata="Q1122081" url="?curid=474843" title="Sea pen">
<text>Sea pens are marine cnidarians belonging to the order Pennatulacea, which are colony-forming benthic filter feeders within the class Octocorallia (subphylum Anthozoa). There are 14 families within the order and 35 extant genera; it is estimated that of 450 described species, around 200 are valid.

Sea pens have a cosmopolitan distribution, being found in tropical and temperate waters worldwide, from intertidal shallow waters to deep seas of more than . Sea pens are grouped with the octocorals together with sea whips (&quot;gorgonians&quot;), but there has been only one molecular study focusing on the phylogenetic relationships within the order Pennatulacea, which mainly treated deep-sea species, and thus information on shallow water species is still lacking.

Although the group is named for its supposed resemblance to antique quill pens, only sea pen species belonging to the suborder Subselliflorae live up to the comparison. Those belonging to the much larger suborder Sessiliflorae lack feathery structures and grow in club-like or radiating forms. The latter suborder includes what are commonly known as sea pansies.

The earliest accepted sea pen fossils are known from the Cambrian-aged Burgess Shale (&quot;Thaumaptilon&quot;). Similar fossils from the Ediacaran 
may show the dawn of sea pens. Precisely what these early fossils are, however, is not decided.

== Taxonomy ==
The order Pennatulacea consists of the following families:

** Chunellidae
** Echinoptilidae
** Renillidae
** Scleroptilidae
** Stachyptilidae
* Suborder Sessiliflorae
** Anthoptilidae
** Funiculinidae 
** Kophobelemnidae 
** Protoptilidae
** Pseudumbellulidae 
** Umbellulidae
** Veretillidae 
* Suborder Subsessiliflorae
** Halipteridae
** Pennatulidae
** Virgulariidae

==Biology==
Due to their wide geographic distribution and long evolutionary history, genetic variation within the different species of sea pen is quite large. Throughout evolution of Pennatulaceans, most sea pens have kept their original mitochondrial gene order, but a certain clade of sea pens shown unique rearrangements through ancestral state reconstruction. There are many populations of sea pens found in mainly Indian waters. It is their polyps that are affected genetically, as they have dispersed within the different waters and islands, and how they use their polyps (tentacles) to protect themselves and other species.

As octocorals, sea pens are colonial animals with multiple polyps (which look somewhat like miniature sea anemones), each with eight tentacles. Unlike other octocorals, however, a sea pen&#x27;s polyps are specialized to specific functions: a single polyp develops into a rigid, erect stalk (the &quot;rachis&quot;) and loses its tentacles, forming a bulbous &quot;root&quot; or &quot;peduncle&quot; at its base. The other polyps branch out from this central stalk, forming water intake structures (&quot;siphonozooids&quot;), feeding structures (&quot;autozooids&quot;) with nematocysts, and reproductive structures. The entire colony is fortified by calcium carbonate in the form of &quot;spicules&quot; and a central &quot;axial rod&quot;.

Using their root-like peduncles to anchor themselves in sandy or muddy substrate, the exposed portion of sea pens may rise up to in some species, such as the tall sea pen (&quot;Funiculina quadrangularis&quot;). Sea pens are sometimes brightly coloured; the orange sea pen (&quot;Ptilosarcus gurneyi&quot;) is a notable example. Rarely found above depths of , sea pens prefer deeper waters where turbulence is less likely to uproot them. Some species may inhabit depths of or more.

While generally sessile animals, sea pens are able to relocate and re-anchor themselves if need be. They position themselves favourably in the path of currents, ensuring a steady flow of plankton, the sea pens&#x27; chief source of food. Their primary predators are nudibranchs and sea stars, some of which feed exclusively on sea pens. The sea pens&#x27; ability to be clumped together and spatially unpredictable hinders sea stars&#x27; predation abilities. When touched, some sea pens emit a bright greenish light; this is known as bioluminescence. They may also force water out of their bodies for defence, rapidly deflating and retreating into their peduncle.

Like other anthozoans, sea pens reproduce by coordinating a release of sperm and eggs into the water column; this may occur seasonally or throughout the year. Fertilized eggs develop into larvae called &quot;planulae&quot; which drift freely for about a week before settling on the substrate. Mature sea pens provide shelter for other animals, such as juvenile fish. Analysis of rachis growth rings indicates sea pens may live for 100 years or more, if the rings are indeed annual in nature.

Some sea pens exhibit glide reflection symmetry, rare among extant animals.

==Aquarium trade==
Sea pens are sometimes sold in the aquarium trade. However, they are generally hard to care for because they need a very deep substrate and have special food requirements.

<text>This Left Feels Right is a compilation album by Bon Jovi, released in 2003. An album featuring new versions of the band&#x27;s songs from previous albums, it charted at No. 14 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It&#x27;s a &quot;trip down memory lane&quot; as Jon Bon Jovi described the album. It features revamped versions of many of Bon Jovi&#x27;s biggest hits, often in a more somber style. Many of the 80&#x27;s hard hitting chart-rockers are presented in a different light as soulful ballads. 

==Release==
The 2003 rendition of &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; was released as a promotional single and also had a video produced, which had the same format as &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive (Live version)&quot;, which was a single from the &quot;One Wild Night Live 1985–2001&quot; album.

For the Russian and CIS release Olivia d&#x27;Abo&#x27;s part in Livin&#x27; on a Prayer was recorded by Russian superstar Alsou in Bon Jovi&#x27;s studio. This version was played on Russian radio stations to promote the release and got positive reviews by Bon Jovi fans, but Olivia&#x27;s version appeared on the Russian CD due to Universal Music Russia&#x27;s decision.

Two new songs, &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; and &quot;Thief of Hearts&quot;, were written and recorded for inclusion of the album. &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; was a song revealing lead singer Jon Bon Jovi&#x27;s anger toward the state of the music industry. Bon Jovi believed that it would become more difficult for artists to find success in the music industry. This was Bon Jovi&#x27;s reason for later removing the two new songs from the album, however Last Man Standing was later reworked and turned into a much more heavy aggressive rock song for inclusion on Bon Jovi&#x27;s 2005 studio album, &quot;Have a Nice Day,&quot; a somewhat opposite effect of the &quot;This Left Feels Right&quot; project. The original version of &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; and &quot;Thief of Hearts&quot; were both later released as part of the box set &quot;100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can&#x27;t Be Wrong&quot; and are also included as live versions on the &quot;This Left Feels Right Live&quot; DVD.

<text>Saint-Brieuc (, Breton: &quot;Sant-Brieg&quot; , Gallo: &quot;Saent-Berioec&quot;) is a city in the Côtes-d&#x27;Armor department in Brittany in northwestern France.

==History==

Saint-Brieuc is named after a Welsh monk, Brioc, who Christianised the region in the 5th century and established an oratory there. Bro Sant-Brieg/Pays de Saint-Brieuc, one of the nine traditional bishoprics of Brittany, which were used as administrative areas before the French Revolution, was named after Saint-Brieuc. It also dates from the Middle Ages when the ‘pays de Saint Brieuc’, or Penteur, was established by Duke Arthur II of Brittany as one of his eight ‘battles’ or administrative regions.

==Geography==

The town is located by the English Channel, on the Bay of Saint-Brieuc. Two rivers flow through Saint-Brieuc: the Goued/Gouët and the Gouedig/Gouédic.

Other towns of notable size in the &quot;département&quot; of Côtes d&#x27;Armor are Gwengamp/Guingamp, Dinan, and Lannuon/Lannion all &quot;sous-préfectures&quot;.

In 2009, large amounts of sea lettuce, a type of alga, washed up on many beaches of Brittany, and when it rotted it emitted dangerous levels of hydrogen sulphide. A horse and some dogs died and a council worker driving a truckload of it fell unconscious at the wheel and died.

===Neighbouring communes===
Langueux, La Méaugon, Plérin, Ploufragan, Trégueux and Trémuson.

===Climate===
Saint-Brieuc experiences an oceanic climate.
&lt;br&gt;
==Culture==

Saint-Brieuc is one of the towns in Europe that host the IU Honors Program.

The &quot;Cemetery of Saint Michel&quot; contains graves of several notable Bretons, and sculptures by Paul le Goff and Jean Boucher. Outside the wall is Armel Beaufils&#x27;s statue of Anatole Le Braz. Le Goff, who was killed with his two brothers in World War I, is also commemorated in a street and with his major sculptural work &quot;La forme se dégageant de la matière&quot; in the central gardens, which also includes a memorial to him by Jules-Charles Le Bozec and work by Francis Renaud.

The town of St. Brieux in Saskatchewan, Canada is named after Saint-Brieuc of Brittany. It was founded by immigrants from this region in Brittany. It was settled in the early 1900s.

<doc id="474861" wikidata="Q313293" url="?curid=474861" title="Martin de Porres">
<text>Martín de Porres Velázquez (9 December 1579 – 3 November 1639) was a Peruvian lay brother of the Dominican Order who was beatified in 1837 by Pope Gregory XVI and canonized in 1962 by Pope John XXIII. He is the patron saint of mixed-race people, barbers, innkeepers, public health workers, all those seeking racial harmony, and animals.

He was noted for his work on behalf of the poor, establishing an orphanage and a children&#x27;s hospital. He maintained an austere lifestyle, which included fasting and abstaining from meat. Among the many miracles attributed to him were those of levitation, bilocation, miraculous knowledge, instantaneous cures, and an ability to communicate with animals.

==Lifestyle== 
Martin was born in the city of Lima, Viceroyalty of Peru, Spanish Empire, on 9 December 1579. He was the illegitimate son of a Spanish nobleman, Don Juan de Porras y de la Peña, and Ana Velázquez, a freed slave of African and Native descent. He had a sister named Juana de Porres, born two years later in 1581. After the birth of his sister, the father abandoned the family. Ana Velázquez supported her children by taking in laundry. Martin grew up in poverty and, when his mother could not support him, he was sent to a primary school for two years, and then placed with a barber surgeon as an apprentice. He spent hours of the night in prayer, a practice that increased as he grew older.

Under Peruvian law, descendants of Africans and Native Americans were barred from becoming full members of religious orders. The only route open to Martin was to ask the Dominicans of Holy Rosary Priory in Lima to accept him as a &quot;donado&quot;, a volunteer who performed menial tasks in the monastery in return for the privilege of wearing the habit and living with the religious community. At the age of 15, he asked for admission to the Dominican Convent of the Rosary in Lima and was received first as a servant boy, and as his duties grew he was promoted to almoner.

Martin continued to practise his old trades of barbering and healing and was said to have performed many miraculous cures. He also took on kitchen work, laundry, and cleaning. After eight years at Holy Rosary, the prior Juan de Lorenzana decided to turn a blind eye to the law and permit Martin to take his vows as a member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic. Holy Rosary was home to 300 men, not all of whom accepted the decision of De Lorenzana: one of the novices called Martin a &quot;mulatto dog&quot;, while one of the priests mocked him for being illegitimate and descended from slaves.

When Martin was 24, he was allowed to profess religious vows as a Dominican lay brother in 1603. He is said to have several times refused this elevation in status, which may have come about due to his father&#x27;s intervention, and he never became a priest. It is said that when his convent was in debt, he implored them: &quot;I am only a poor mulatto, sell me.&quot; Martin was deeply attached to the Blessed Sacrament, and he was praying in front of it one night when the step of the altar he was kneeling on caught fire. Throughout all the confusion and chaos that followed, he remained where he was, unaware of what was happening around him.
When Martin was 34, after he had been given the religious habit of a lay brother, he was assigned to the infirmary, where he was placed in charge and would remain in service until his death at the age of 59. He was known for his care of the sick. His superiors saw in him the virtues necessary to exercise unfailing patience in this difficult role. It was not long before miracles were attributed to him. Martin also cared for the sick outside his convent, often bringing them healing with only a simple glass of water. He ministered without distinction to Spanish nobles and to slaves recently brought from Africa. One day an aged beggar, covered with ulcers and almost naked, stretched out his hand, and Martin took him to his own bed. When one of his brethren reproved him, Martin replied: &quot;Compassion, my dear Brother, is preferable to cleanliness.&quot;

When an epidemic struck Lima, there were in this single Convent of the Rosary 60 friars who were sick, many of them novices in a distant and locked section of the convent, separated from the professed. Martin is said to have passed through the locked doors to care for them, a phenomenon which was reported in the residence more than once. The professed, too, saw him suddenly beside them without the doors having been opened. Martin continued to transport the sick to the convent until the provincial superior, alarmed by the contagion threatening the friars, forbade him to continue to do so. His sister, who lived in the country, offered her house to lodge those whom the residence of the religious could not hold. One day he found on the street a poor Indian, bleeding to death from a dagger wound, and took him to his own room until he could transport him to his sister&#x27;s hospice. The prior, when he heard of this, reprimanded him for disobedience. He was extremely edified, however, by his reply: &quot;Forgive my error, and please instruct me, for I did not know that the precept of obedience took precedence over that of charity.&quot; The prior gave him liberty thereafter to follow his inspirations in the exercise of mercy.

Martin did not eat meat. He begged for alms to procure necessities the convent could not provide. In normal times, he succeeded with his alms in feeding 160 poor persons every day, and distributed a remarkable sum of money every week to the indigent. Side by side with his daily work in the kitchen, laundry and infirmary, Martin&#x27;s life is said to have reflected extraordinary gifts: ecstasies that lifted him into the air, light filling the room where he prayed, bilocation, miraculous knowledge, instantaneous cures and a remarkable rapport with animals. He founded a residence for orphans and abandoned children in the city of Lima.

==Death and commemoration==
Martin was a friend of both Saint Juan Macías, a fellow Dominican lay brother, and Saint Rose of Lima, another lay Dominican. By his death on 3 November 1639, he had won the affection and respect of many of his fellow Dominicans as well as a host of people outside the priory. Word of his miracles had made him known as a saint throughout the region. As his body was displayed to allow the people of the city to pay their respects, each person snipped a tiny piece of his habit to keep as a relic. 

When the body of de Porres was exhumed after 25 years, it was supposedly found intact, and exuded a fine fragrance. Letters to Rome pleaded for his beatification; the decree affirming the heroism of his virtues was issued in 1763 by Pope Clement XIII. Pope Gregory XVI beatified Martin de Porres on 29 October 1837, and the cause for his canonization was opened on 8 June 1926. 

Pope John XXIII canonized him in Rome on 6 May 1962. He is the patron saint of people of mixed race, and of innkeepers, barbers, public health workers and more, with a feast day on November 3, also commemorated in the Calendar of Saints of the Church of England.

==Iconography==

Martin de Porres is often depicted as a young mixed-race friar wearing the old habit of the Dominican lay brother, a black scapular and capuce, along with a broom, since he considered all work to be sacred, no matter how menial. He is sometimes shown with a dog, a cat and a mouse eating in peace from the same dish.

==Legacy==
Martin&#x27;s sometimes defiant attachment to the ideal of social justice achieved deep resonance in a church attempting to carry forward that ideal in today&#x27;s modern world. 

Today, Martin is commemorated by, among other things, a school building that houses the medical, nursing, and rehabilitation science schools of the Dominican University of Santo Tomas in the Philippines. A programme of work is also named after him at the Las Casas Institute at Blackfriars Hall, University of Oxford. He is the titular saint of the parish of St. Martin de Porres in Poughkeepsie, New York, and some elementary schools. A number of Catholic churches are named after him. The Southern Province of Dominicans in the United States also bears his name.

==In popular culture==
In 1965, American composer E. Anne Schwerdtfeger composed the &quot;Mass of St. Martin de Porres&quot; for chorus and organ.

In the 1980 novel &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;, Ignatius Reilly contemplates praying to Martin for aid in bringing social justice to the black workers at the New Orleans factory where he works. In music, the first track of jazz pianist Mary Lou Williams&#x27;s album &quot;Black Christ of the Andes&quot; is titled &quot;St. Martin De Porres&quot;.

There are several Spanish and Mexican works regarding his life in cinema and television, starring Cuban actor Rene Muñoz, most of them referring to his mixed race, his miracles and his life of humility. The best known movies are &quot;Fray Escoba&quot; (Friar Broom) (1963) and &quot;Un mulato llamado Martin&quot; (A Mulatto Called Martin) (1975).

In the &quot;Moone Boy&quot; episode &quot;Godfellas&quot;, the character Martin Moon is shown to be named by his grandfather after San Martin de Porres. His grandfather is unable to actually remember any of San Martin&#x27;s accomplishments, and simply refers to him as &quot;one of the black ones&quot; when asked about him.

American singer Madonna&#x27;s lead single &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; (1989) featured Martin de Porres as a character in the song&#x27;s music video. The portrayal of de Porres and Madonna in a romantic relationship was met with mixed criticism from the Catholic church in Peru and the Vatican.

<text>Kevin John Sheedy AO (born 24 December 1947) is a former Australian rules football coach and player in the Australian Football League. He played and coached in a combined total of 929 games over 47 years from 1967 until 2013, which is a VFL/AFL record. Sheedy was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2008 and on 29 May 2018 was elevated to legend status.

On the field, Sheedy played for in the Victorian Football League during the 1960s and 1970s, captaining the side in 1978 and winning three premierships. He then coached in the VFL/AFL for nearly three decades from 1981 until 2007, winning four premierships and earning acclaim for his unusual and creative approaches to promoting the club and the game. Sheedy conceived the first Anzac Day game in 1995 involving Collingwood and the club he coached at the time, Essendon. In 2009, Sheedy joined the newly formed as its inaugural AFL coach, and he coached there from 2012 until 2013.

==Early life==
Sheedy was born in Melbourne to devout Catholic parents. He played junior football with the local Try Boys society team while attending De La Salle College, Malvern, where future teammate Kevin Bartlett also spent a brief time. In 1963, he joined Prahran in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) and spent a year with the Under 19s. The next year, at the age of 16, he played senior football with the Two Blues and was soon a regular with the team. His home was in Melbourne&#x27;s zone, so he took up an invitation to try out with the Demons, playing a few practice matches. But he did not feel comfortable there and returned to Prahran, playing in the club&#x27;s Second Division premiership team in 1966.

Between 1969 and 1971, Sheedy undertook two years National Service with the Australian Army&#x27;s 21 Construction Squadron, rising to the rank of corporal before discharge.

==Playing career==
===Richmond===
Richmond showed early interest in Sheedy and received permission from Melbourne to speak with him. Sheedy jumped at the chance to join the up-and-coming Tigers, but a problem emerged when he shifted to Punt Road: the VFA refused to endorse his clearance due to a wider disagreement with the VFL relating to transfer fees. The VFA had weeks earlier set a minimum transfer fee of $3,000 for any of its players crossing to the VFL, and Sheedy&#x27;s transfer fee was set even higher at $5,000; but the VFL considered this price so exorbitant that it responded by terminating its player transfer reciprocity agreement with the VFA, allowing Sheedy to move to Richmond without a clearance and without the transfer fee being paid. For crossing without a transfer, Sheedy was suspended from VFA competition for five years, but he remained free to play in the VFL during this time.

Another hurdle to jump was Billy Barrot. Barrot, a star player loved by the Tiger fans, played in Sheedy&#x27;s favoured position of centre. However, Barrot was somewhat temperamental and prone to miss some matches. When he was injured in the third game of the year, Sheedy was selected in his place for his debut. However, Sheedy struggled and, after six games in the seniors, found himself back in the reserves for the remainder of the year. His season was ended by a serious knee injury that further put his future into doubt. From the sidelines, he watched Richmond win the premiership against .

Returned to fitness, Sheedy faced an enormous challenge in 1968. Coach Tom Hafey saw something in Sheedy&#x27;s willingness to listen, his determination, and fierce desire for the ball. Placed in a back pocket, Sheedy consolidated his place in the senior side and then began to emerge as key player in the team&#x27;s defence. He won a Victorian guernsey in 1969 and was a stand-out in the Tigers&#x27; three finals games, which culminated in a second flag in three years. He finished runner-up best and fairest to claim a remarkable turnaround in just two years.

By now, Sheedy&#x27;s onfield persona marked him as a &quot;villain&quot; to be watched. He enjoyed niggling his opponents—physically and verbally—and seemed to be at the centre of every melee on the ground. Occasionally, his teammates blanched at some of his more theatrical attempts to win free kicks or fifteen-metre penalties, and he had the ability to whip opposing supporters into a frenzy. Since his injury, Sheedy had lived on the edge knowing that if he failed at Richmond it would be the end of the line because of the impending five-year suspension; however, he seemed to have an innate ability to read how far he could push the envelope, and indeed he was never reported during his career, a fact that would surprise most who saw him play.

He was now acknowledged the best in his position in the VFL and a key personality at Punt Road. A turning point came in the 1972 season when Sheedy played in Richmond&#x27;s losing Grand Final team. In an earlier final, Sheedy had ruffled Carlton&#x27;s captain-coach, John Nicholls, suggesting that he was finished as a player and that Richmond had the wood on the Blues. Nicholls and his men, stung by media criticism and the attitude of the Richmond players, played a whirlwind first half in the Grand Final, booting eighteen goals to lead by 45 points. Sheedy, caught embarrassingly out of position a number of times, was switched to the unfamiliar position of ruck rover for the last half. Although the Tigers lost, Sheedy was a revelation in his new role.

Now permanently playing on the ball, he set up Richmond&#x27;s Grand Final win in 1973 with three goals in the first quarter. He was judged best afield in the 1974 Grand Final with 30 disposals, accentuated by an uncanny piece of play in the second quarter. Sheedy marked next to the goalpost, went back to apparently take his kick from the impossible angle surrounded by opposition players, and then casually ran in and handballed over the head of the man on the mark to lone teammate in the goal square who booted the easiest goal of his life. It was this mixture of flamboyance and cunning that attracted the media to him, and Sheedy was voted player of the year by journalists.

Sheedy made good copy; during the season, Richmond had appointed him as full-time promotions officer, effectively making him the first professional footballer in the VFL. In time, all of the clubs would copy this appointment, and, by the 1980s, most clubs had a half dozen or so players employed as promotions officers. It was a bridge between the casual Saturday afternoon era and the age of true professionalism in the 1990s.

After finishing third in 1975, Richmond began a slide down the ladder. Sheedy&#x27;s standard, however, remained high—in 1976, he won the best and fairest for the only time and received life membership of the club. However, he was shocked when his mentor and idol Tom Hafey left the club due to a lack of support at committee level.

In 1978, he was made captain, but his game was now struggling. After just four games the following year in the 1979 season, Sheedy read the writing on the wall when he started all of the matches on the bench, He then announced his retirement from his playing career later on in the 1979 season.

Late in his football-playing career, Sheedy also played a handful of district cricket games. A leg spinner, he played for Richmond&#x27;s minor grades in 1976/77 as well as playing five First XI games in 1977/78; having been appointed captain of the football club, the football club&#x27;s committee barred him from participating in the cricket final. Sheedy has described his reluctance to fight the committee&#x27;s decision as one of his greatest regrets.

Sheedy played for Richmond Football Club from 1967 until 1979 for a total of 251 games and kicked 91 goals, and a member of the club&#x27;s premiership teams in 1969, 1973 and 1974.

==Coaching career==

===Richmond===
After Sheedy&#x27;s retirement from his playing career, Sheedy immediately became an assistant coach at Richmond Football Club under senior coach Tony Jewell during the 1980 season where Richmond ended up winning the premiership in the 1980 Grand Final. It was clear he was preparing for a senior coaching role. He examined every facet of the club as the team went on to take the premiership.

===Essendon===
Sheedy replaced Barry Davis as Essendon Football Club senior coach, starting from the 1981 season after Davis resigned at the end of the 1980 season.

Sheedy&#x27;s greatest impact on the game was during his 27-year career as senior coach of the Essendon Bombers. Sheedy held down the role continuously between 1981 and 2007, during which time some other sides had had over a dozen different coaches. Essendon won four premierships during Sheedy&#x27;s tenure as senior coach in 1984, 1985, 1993 and 2000 as well as finishing runner-up three more times in 1983, 1990 and 2001 and losing a further two Preliminary Finals by only 1 point in 1996 and 1999.

He has never been regarded as a passive coach, and he was well known for trying what commentators have often described as bizarre tactics. Sheedy has always believed in trying his players in as many different positions as possible as well as giving discarded players from other clubs a second chance. These moves haven&#x27;t always paid off, but sometimes they have been crucial. Sheedy made several moves in the last quarter of the 1984 grand final, when Essendon looked out of the game, and the side scored a come-from-behind victory. On the recruiting front, prior to the 2000 season, Sheedy lured ruckman John Barnes back to Essendon (a side that had traded him many years earlier) in the 1999 AFL draft after he was let go by . Barnes proved to be a valuable player in the premiership side that year.

In June 2004, during the 2004 season, Sheedy renewed his contract as Essendon Football Club senior coach for a further three years, due to the great on-field performance during Sheedy&#x27;s tenure. In the 2004 season, where Essendon under Sheedy finished in eighth place on the ladder and therefore made the finals. When the Bombers under Sheedy defeated Melbourne in the first elimination final, before being eliminated by Geelong in the semi-final. This is what ended up being the last finals performance for the Bombers under Sheedy&#x27;s tenure at the club.

In the 2005 season, Essendon under Sheedy missed the finals for the first time since 1997, where the club under Sheedy finished in thirteenth place on the ladder with eight wins and fourteen losses at the end of the 2005 season.

In Round 9 of the 2006 AFL season, Sheedy coached his 600th VFL/AFL game. However, the milestone was not one to be remembered fondly, as Essendon went down by 60 points to (a fate that also befell Jock McHale, who lost his 600th game as coach of Collingwood). The loss marked a low point in Sheedy&#x27;s career, when the Bombers on-field performance deteriorated under Sheedy in the 2006 season and then missing the finals in 2006 and finishing 15th (second-last) position on the ladder with three wins, one draw and eighteen losses. This was the club&#x27;s lowest finish under Sheedy, and the club&#x27;s lowest finish in over 70 years despite defeating defending premiers in the first round of the season.

Also during the 2006 season, Sheedy took a leave of absence for one game when he injured his shoulder in a collision with defender Dean Solomon at training. Assistant coach Gary O&#x27;Donnell then took over as caretaker interim senior coach in the absence of Sheedy, for one game in Round 16, 2006, where Essendon drew with long-time rivals Carlton to end its then-record 14-match losing streak dating back to round two.

During the 2006 season, it was revealed that Sheedy had considered luring a 19-year-old Lance Franklin to the club from as the Bombers looked to strengthen the team in the wake of its poor 2006 season.

Until Round 16, 2007, Sheedy had coached the club in 629 games, a record for Essendon, and the second most by any coach in the history of the game. Coupled with the 251 games as a player, it is the most combined games as a player and coach in the history of the AFL, as some of Jock McHale&#x27;s games were as a captain-coach.

During the 2007 season, following the mid-year departures of other AFL senior coaches Neale Daniher, Chris Connolly and Denis Pagan, speculation mounted that Essendon would remove Sheedy in order to hire one of these experienced coaches or alternatively compete with the other coachless clubs for the leading candidates. On 25 July 2007, six weeks out from the finals, Essendon was on the brink of making the finals yet again when surprisingly it was announced that Sheedy&#x27;s contract, due to expire at the end of the season, would not be renewed. Sheedy had however agreed to stay for the rest of the season to see it through rather than employ a so-called caretaker senior coach. After the club sacked Sheedy, the Bombers under Sheedy lost four of the remaining six matches and collapsed as a finals contender to finish in twelfth place on the ladder with ten wins and twelve losses at the end of the 2007 season. Sheedy&#x27;s last home game as Essendon Football Club senior coach was against his old playing side in Round 21, 2007 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Nearly 90,000 spectators turned out to farewell him and the retiring player James Hird. Although Essendon were defeated by a few goals, Sheedy received a standing ovation as he left the field for the last time.
Sheedy had his ultimate farewell match against West Coast Eagles in Round 22, 2007 at the Subiaco Oval. Essendon trailed by a 44 points at three quarter time, and aided by 7 goals from Scott Lucas, attempted one of the greatest comebacks in AFL history, getting within 2 points with 5 minutes to go after Lucas missed a chance at his 8th goal of the quarter, but ultimately went down by 8 points. The massive comeback did effect West Coast&#x27;s percentage, costing the Eagles a home qualifying final. Sheedy was replaced by Matthew Knights as Essendon Football Club senior coach.

Sheedy coached Essendon Football Club from 1981 until 2007, for a total of 27 seasons, with a record of 634 games with 386 wins 242 losses and 6 draws to a winning percentage at 60 percent. Sheedy also coached the club to a total of four premierships in 1984, 1985, 1993 and 2000 as well as when the club finished as runners-up in 1983, 1990 and 2001.

===Greater Western Sydney===
On 9 November 2009, Sheedy signed a three-year deal to be named as the inaugural senior coach of the Greater Western Sydney Giants, which joined the AFL in 2012. This was after there had been intense speculation he would return to Richmond as senior coach; however, this did not eventuate. Sheedy also missed out on the Melbourne coaching job at the end of 2007. His contract with GWS was subsequently extended for the 2013 season.

Greater Western Sydney lost both their games in the 2011 NAB Cup, including one to the Sydney Swans with a score of 4 points to 83; however, it should be kept in mind that the games in this tournament consisted of two 20-minute halves, and it was fairly common for teams to notch up very low scores (as a reference point, six teams scores a total of 15 points or less in the Round 1 games, including three teams scoring single-figure tallies). They fared better in the second game against the Gold Coast Suns, which they lost 27 points to 52.

Sheedy coached the Giants in their first season in the AFL in the 2012 season. Their inaugural AFL victory was on 12 May 2012 against the Gold Coast Suns. In Round 19 of the 2012 season, Sheedy coached in his 1000th game, a total including pre-season, night, international, and representative matches. The GWS Giants under Sheedy in their inaugural season, at the end of the 2012 season, finished in eighteenth position, which was the last position on the ladder for the wooden spoon with two wins and twenty losses.

In the 2013 season, The GWS Giants under Sheedy, finished in eighteenth position, which was the last position on the ladder for the wooden spoon for the second straight year in a row with only one win and twenty one losses.

On 1 September 2013, Sheedy coached his 679th and final game as a senior coach in the VFL/AFL, in Round 23, 2013, which was an 83-point loss against Gold Coast Suns at Carrara Stadium in the Gold Coast, Queensland. The two competing teams formed a guard of honour for Sheedy and a handover ceremony took place with Sheedy passing the baton to assistant coach Leon Cameron who succeeded him as senior coach, therefore at the end of the match, both teams had formed a guard of honour for Sheedy as he left the field for the final time. Cameron&#x27;s contract, signed in October 2012, stipulated one year as assistant coach under senior coach Sheedy and then 3 years as the senior coach.

In his two seasons as the senior coach of the Giants, Sheedy coached 44 games. The team during his tenure had 3 wins and 41 losses, a winning percentage of 6.82%.

==Post-coaching career==
After Sheedy left the Essendon Football Club when he was sacked as senior coach at the end of the 2007 season, Sheedy visited the United States and Canada in 2007 on a tour of North America as AFL ambassador, attending the USAFL National Championships, and was well received from stateside fans.

In October 2008, Sheedy was appointed in a marketing role at the Richmond Football Club. In this role, Sheedy focused solely on marketing and promotions.

Sheedy was appointed to the board of directors at the GWS Giants in December 2013.

In 2015, Sheedy left and departed from his position as board member of the GWS Giants, to return to the Essendon Football Club in the role of General Manager, Commercial Development and Innovation. In this role, Sheedy worked closely with commercial, community and marketing departments, spending significant time engaging with key stakeholders, developing new growth strategies and supporting the successful execution of the broader club vision and strategy.

In September 2020, Sheedy was appointed to the board of directors at the Essendon Football Club. On August 15, 2024, it was announced that Sheedy would step down from the board at Essendon Football Club at the end of the 2024 AFL season.

==Legacy==
Sheedy&#x27;s legacy is credited by &quot;some commentators who observed that his considerable achievements were due not so much to abundant natural talent but to determination and the thoughtful application of his abilities&quot;. Despite Sheedy&#x27;s impressive record in Australian Rules football as a player and coach, &quot;his most profound influence may be the innovations he proposed and supported. He has left an indelible mark on the game&quot;. Sheedy&#x27;s most enduring legacy will be the changes that he promoted and supported, where he was a proponent of the extended interchange bench from two players to four, which has eased the physical demands on players caused by the increasing speed of the game and Sheedy also came up with the creation of the annual Essendon–Collingwood Anzac Day match. Sheedy has also been a great promoter and supporter of indigenous players, developing initiatives to take the game to indigenous communities and to foster and develop promising players. He also promoted the creation of an annual Essendon–Richmond Dreamtime at the &#x27;G match to recognise each club&#x27;s achievements in supporting the integration of indigenous culture and players. He has watched with pride as these and other initiatives have brought about a steady expansion of the number of indigenous players, the rewards mutually enjoyed, and the role models they provide to up-and-coming indigenous players. According to the Sport Australia Hall of Fame, in which Sheedy was inducted in 2009, &quot;For all the Premiership trophies he has held aloft as player and coach, it is this legacy that may give him greatest satisfaction.&quot;

==Public persona==
Aside from his venerable coaching and playing record, Sheedy is also noted for his quirky antics, outspoken nature, and wry sense of humour. For example, before a game against West Coast Eagles at Essendon&#x27;s former home ground of Windy Hill in 1991—the first time hosting the Eagles at the venue—he tied the windsock down on the School End outer terrace so the opposition would not know which way the wind was blowing. The tactic worked, and the Eagles won the toss and kicked into the breeze for the first quarter, although the Bombers inevitably lost by 7 points nonetheless. In 2021, 30 years after the incident, Sheedy said, in jest, that he tied the windsock down because the brand sponsor on the windsock had neglected to pay their account. The incident kick-started a fierce rivalry that would span decades. He is also fond of talking about how Martians cost his side the game in post-match press conferences, an oblique reference to the umpires, as AFL rules forbid coaches from criticising umpiring decisions. Such stories perpetuate the eccentric Sheedy myth and enigma of a man who would try anything for success.

Furthering the Sheedy legend on an episode of the TV show &quot;The Front Bar&quot;, Sheedy was shown archival news footage of his spies discreetly surveying the opposition&#x27;s training sessions. While such tactics were common practice among all clubs at the time, Sheedy took it one step further by employing an amateur footballer to visit a private Hawthorn training session to gather intel by posing as a Hawthorn player. The spy managed to last 15 minutes &quot;before being given his marching orders&quot;.

Another of his most memorable stunts came in 1993, again against the Eagles. In his excitement at winning a close match, with ruckman and forward Paul Salmon kicking a goal 30 seconds before the final siren against the West Coast Eagles, he waved his jacket in the air as he came rushing from the coaches&#x27; box. To this day, the supporters of the winning club wave their jackets in the air after the game when the two teams play. The moment is captured in Jamie Cooper&#x27;s painting &quot;the Game That Made Australia&quot;, commissioned by the AFL in 2008 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the sport, with Sheedy shown waving a red, black and yellow jacket rather than a red and black jacket, to reflect Sheedy&#x27;s support of indigenous footballers.

Another example of his ability to build up and promote matches was in 1998 when he labelled North Melbourne executives Greg Miller and Mark Dawson &quot;marshmallows&quot;, referring to how soft they were. This caused a tension between the two camps, and it came back to bite Sheedy when North Melbourne defeated Essendon in a finals match that season. After the match, Kangaroos supporters were provided with marshmallows, which they threw at Sheedy. Unfazed by this, Sheedy then promoted the rematch in 1999 as the &quot;marshmallow&quot; game.

Despite Sheedy&#x27;s typically measured disposition, Sheedy did lose his cool on one occasion in 2000. In yet another game against the Eagles, Sheedy was fined $7,500 by the tribunal after making a cut-throat gesture to then-Eagle Mitchell White during the half-time break of the Essendon–West Coast clash in Round 15, 2000, also apparently mouthing the words &quot;You... are... fucked!&quot; to White.

Sheedy has long been an ambassador for the game throughout Australia, taking it upon himself to promote both the game in general and the Essendon club in particular. He has also done a great deal of work with Aboriginal communities in the northern parts of Australia, encouraging young Aboriginal people to take up the game, and being a vocal supporter of anti-racial vilification laws in the game. He has also encouraged foreign players to train with his side such as a former American footballer, a skillfully athletic Ethiopian immigrant, and more recently two Japanese try-outs.

In the build-up to the 2005 International Rules Series, as coach of the Australian side, Sheedy promoted the game by lightheartedly mentioning that supporters could attend the International rules game and be in for a high-scoring clash, or watch the Melbourne Victory game, which was on at the same time, and see a scoreline of &quot;0–0, or 1–0, or 1–1&quot;.

Sheedy visited the United States and Canada in 2007 on a tour of North America as AFL ambassador, attending the USAFL National Championships, and was well received from stateside fans.

==Honours and appointments==
In 1998, Sheedy was made a Member of the Order of Australia. In 2019, he was advanced to an Officer of the Order of Australia.

He received an Australian Sports Medal in 2000 and a Centenary Medal in 2001.

In 2003, Sheedy was awarded the Anniversary of National Service 1951–1972 Medal for his service as a National Serviceman in the Australian Army between 1969 and 1972.
 
He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2009.

Kevin is also a current Australian Apprenticeships Ambassador for the Australian Government.

Sheedy was awarded an honorary doctorate from Australian Catholic University.

<doc id="474873" wikidata="Q194425" url="?curid=474873" title="Mamba">
<text>Mambas are fast-moving, highly venomous snakes of the genus Dendroaspis (which literally means &quot;tree asp&quot;) in the family Elapidae. Four extant species are recognised currently; three of those four species are essentially arboreal and green in colour, whereas the black mamba, &quot;Dendroaspis polylepis&quot;, is largely terrestrial and generally brown or grey in colour. All are native to various regions in sub-Saharan Africa and all are feared throughout their ranges, especially the black mamba. In Africa there are many legends and stories about mambas.

==Behaviour==
The three green species of mambas are arboreal, whereas the black mamba is largely terrestrial. All four species are active diurnal hunters, preying on birds, lizards, and small mammals. At nightfall some species, especially the terrestrial black mamba, shelter in a lair. A mamba may retain the same lair for years. Resembling a cobra, the threat display of a mamba includes rearing, opening the mouth and hissing. The black mamba&#x27;s mouth is black within, which renders the threat more conspicuous. A rearing mamba has a narrower yet longer hood and tends to lean well forward, instead of standing erect as a cobra does.

Stories of black mambas that chase and attack humans are common, but in fact the snakes generally avoid contact with humans. The black mamba (&quot;Dendroaspis polylepis&quot;) is a highly venomous snake species native to various parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Black mambas are fast-moving, nervous snakes that will strike when threatened. According to findings by Branch (2016), their venom comprises neurotoxins and cardiotoxins that can rapidly induce symptoms, including dizziness, extreme fatigue, vision problems, foaming at the mouth, paralysis, convulsions, and eventual death from respiratory or cardiac failure if untreated. Although black mamba venom is highly toxic, antivenom is available and can treat envenomation promptly.

Most apparent cases of pursuit probably are examples of where witnesses have mistaken the snake&#x27;s attempt to retreat to its lair when a human happens to be in the way. The black mamba usually uses its speed to escape from threats, and humans actually are their main predators, rather than prey.

==Venom==
All mambas have medically significant venom, with dendrotoxins, short chain alpha-neurotoxins, cardiotoxins and fasciculins. All mambas are classified as snakes of medical importance by the World Health Organization.
There are multiple components in dendrotoxins with different targets:

*&quot;Dendrotoxin 1&quot;, which inhibits the K+ channels at the pre and post-synaptic level in the intestinal smooth muscle. It also inhibits Ca2+-sensitive K+ channels from rat skeletal muscle‚ incorporated into planar bilayers (Kd = 90 nM in 50 mM KCl).)
*&quot;Dendrotoxin 3&quot;, which inhibits acetylcholine M4 receptors.
*&quot;Dendrotoxin 7&quot;, commonly referred to as muscarinic toxin 7 (MT7) inhibits acetylcholine M1 receptors.
*&quot;Dendrotoxin K&quot;, structurally homologous to Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitors with activity as a selective blocker of voltage-gated potassium channels

Toxicity alone does not determine severity of envenomation; other factors include the snake&#x27;s temperament, venom yields, proximity of wounds to the CNS and depth of punctures. Bites by all members of this genus are capable of causing rapid onsets of symptoms, but it is the black mamba whose bite has the worst prognosis, possibly as a result of its more terrestrial nature (having more potential for human contact), high defensiveness (having a higher possibility to deliver fatal bites instead of dry bites), large size (giving it a higher strike position proximal to the victim&#x27;s brain), and higher average venom yields and potential toxicity (based on experimental results). A lethality rate of near 100% for untreated black mamba bites has been circulating between various sources, which is probably based on a single medical record made in a single district between 1957 and 1963 when specific antivenom had yet to be introduced. Seven out of seven victims of this species who received non-specific polyvalent antivenom, that had no effect on the species&#x27; toxins, succumbed to its bites. However, another snakebite survey in South Africa reported a death rate of approximately 43% among those who received ineffective treatments (15 fatal cases out of 35 patients). A mamba-specific antivenom was introduced in 1962, followed by a fully polyvalent antivenom in 1971; over this period, 5 out of 38 people in South Africa bitten by black mambas who received the antivenom died, according to the same report. Since then, the number has significantly dropped with the widespread use of specific antivenom.

Despite their fearsome reputation and often exaggerated notoriety, mamba envenomation occurs far less frequently than some other snakes&#x27;, for instance the puff adder. Besides proximity to residences, behaviour of a given species is also a critical aspect when it comes to snakebite morbidities. Mambas are agile, usually fleeing from any confrontation with unambiguous threat display which allows early recognition of the serpent, avoiding escalation in tension.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Dendroaspis&quot;, is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;déndron&quot; (&quot;δένδρον&quot;), meaning &quot;tree&quot;, and &quot;aspis&quot; (&quot;ασπίς&quot;), which is understood to mean &quot;shield&quot;, but also denotes &quot;cobra&quot; or simply &quot;snake&quot;, in particular &quot;snake with hood (shield)&quot;. Via Latin &quot;aspis&quot;, it is the source of the English word &quot;asp&quot;. In ancient texts, &quot;aspis&quot; or asp often referred to the Egyptian cobra (&quot;Naja haje&quot;), in reference to its shield-like hood. The genus was first described by the German naturalist Hermann Schlegel in 1848, with &quot;Elaps jamesonii&quot; as the type species. It was misspelt as &quot;Dendraspis&quot; by Dumeril in 1856, and generally uncorrected by subsequent authors. In 1936, Dutch herpetologist Leo Brongersma pointed out that the correct spelling was &quot;Dendroaspis&quot; but added that the name was invalid as Fitzinger had coined &quot;Dendraspis&quot; in 1843 for the king cobra and hence had priority. However, in 1962 German herpetologist Robert Mertens proposed that the 1843 description of &quot;Dendraspis&quot; by Fitzinger be suppressed due to its similarity to &quot;Dendroaspis&quot;, and the confusion it would cause by its use.

===Range and characteristics===
Black mambas live in the savannas and rocky hills of southern and eastern Africa. They are Africa&#x27;s longest venomous snake, reaching up to 14 feet in length, although 8.2 feet is more the average. They are also among the fastest snakes in the world, slithering at speeds of up to 12.5 miles per hour.

=== Phylogeny ===
A 2018 analysis of the venom of the mambas, as well as a 2016 genetic analysis, found the following cladogram representative of the relationship between the species.

<doc id="474875" wikidata="Q174487" url="?curid=474875" title="Flag of the Cayman Islands">
<text>The flag of the Cayman Islands consists of a Blue Ensign defaced with the British overseas territory&#x27;s coat of arms. Adopted in 1959 to supplement the Union Jack and to replace the flag of the Colony of Jamaica, it has been the flag of the Cayman Islands since the territory was granted self-government that year. The design of the present flag entailed removing the white disc and outlining the coat of arms with a white trim, although the previous version is often used in an official capacity. The Cayman Islands&#x27; flag is similar to the flags of eight other British Overseas Territories, which are also Blue Ensigns with their respective coats of arms.

==History==
The Cayman Islands were first spotted by Christopher Columbus on 10 May 1503, during his fourth and final journey to the West Indies. The Spanish initially named the islands &quot;Las Tortugas&quot; due to the sizable population of turtles living in the nearby waters. Less than three decades later, the territory was referred to as the Caimanas or Caymanes, in regard to the alligators (&quot;caimánes&quot;) that were purportedly native to the isles. No permanent inhabitants resided there until well after the Treaty of Madrid in 1670, in which Habsburg Spain permanently relinquished sovereignty over the Cayman Islands and several other islands in the Caribbean to the Kingdom of England. The Caymans subsequently became a dependency of the Colony of Jamaica in 1863. After fourteen years, the three islands of Grand Cayman, Little Cayman, and Cayman Brac were consolidated under a common administration.
The Cayman Islands were granted their own coat of arms on 14 May 1958. It was consequently utilised on the Blue Ensign, with a white disc as its background. This was adopted as a proxy national flag in 1959, after authorisation was granted by the Admiralty. The territory was given self-government in July of the same year, around the time that they joined the West Indies Federation. They remained a British territory after the federation was dissolved in 1962. The usage of both the Blue Ensign and the Red Ensign – a courtesy flag flown unofficially on private ships – was ultimately authorised in 1988. The flag was redesigned eleven years later, with the size of the coat of arms increased, and the white disc removed and replaced with a white outline. The Union Jack remains the state flag of the Cayman Islands.

===Continued use of the white disc flag===

Although the flag was officially changed in 1999, both old and new flags are interchangeably used in an official capacity. According to the Government of the Cayman Islands, the flag includes the white roundel, unchanged from before 1999. The Parliament of the Cayman Islands has vested responsibility for the sale and production of all national flags to the National Museum and because they regard the white disc version to be correct, the vast majority of flags produced have white discs. The white disc flag is employed as the backdrop for the official 2020 portrait of the Governor of the Cayman Islands on the UK Government Website and for the portraits of most government officials.

==Design==
===Symbolism===
The colours and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The blue and white waves evoke the Caribbean Sea, while the three green stars represent the territory&#x27;s three islands of Grand Cayman, Little Cayman, and Cayman Brac. The yellow lion on the red field is a conspicuous symbol of the Kingdom of England, the Cayman Islands&#x27; mother country. The turtle alludes to the original Spanish name for the islands (&quot;Las Tortugas&quot;), as well as its tradition of seafaring. The pineapple signifies Cayman&#x27;s connection with Jamaica, whose coat of arms features five pineapples. The turtle and pineapple also epitomise the flora and fauna of the islands. The motto, &quot;He hath founded it upon the seas&quot;, is derived from the Book of Psalms 24:2, and recognises the Christian patrimony of the islands.

===Similarities===
The Blue Ensign is also utilised on the flags of eight of the thirteen other British Overseas Territories, with their coats of arms in the fly being the sole difference between them. These are, namely, the flags of Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the Falkland Islands, Montserrat, the Pitcairn Islands, Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and the Turks and Caicos Islands.

==Variants==
The standard of the territory&#x27;s governor features the Union Jack defaced with the territorial coat of arms at the centre. The civil ensign (for merchant ships) is nearly identical in design to the territorial flag, but uses a Red Ensign instead.

==Protocol==
Advice regarding flag etiquette is the responsibility of the territory&#x27;s Protocol Office. When displayed together with the flags of other sovereign nations, the foreign flag should not be flown on top of or to the right (i.e. observer&#x27;s left) of the Caymanian flag. The only exception to this recommendation is when the Union Jack is flown, in which case the flag of the Cayman Islands yields pride of place to it.

The guidelines also state that the flag is not to touch the ground, nor should it be suspended vertically. It ought to be hoisted at sunrise and lowered at sunset, unless the flag is illuminated at night. When it becomes damaged and is no longer fit to be publicly displayed, it is permissible to dispose of the territorial flag, ideally via burning.

<doc id="474876" wikidata="Q457635" url="?curid=474876" title="Coat of arms of the Cayman Islands">
<text>The coat of arms of the [[Cayman Islands]] was approved by the Legislative Assembly in 1957, and public input was sought on its design. The Royal Warrant assigning &quot;Armorial Ensigns for the Cayman Islands&quot; was approved by Her Majesty&#x27;s command on 14 May 1958.

The arms consists of a shield, a crested helm and the motto. Three green stars, representing each of the three inhabited Islands (Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac), are set in the lower two-thirds of the shield. The stars rest on blue and white wavy bands representing the sea. In the top third of the shield, against a red background, is a gold lion &quot;passant guardant&quot; (walking with the further forepaw raised and the body seen from the side), representing Britain. Above the shield is a green turtle on a coil of rope. Behind the turtle is a gold pineapple. The turtle represents the seafaring history; the rope, its traditional thatch-rope industry; and the pineapple, its ties with Jamaica.

The islands&#x27; motto, &quot;He hath founded it upon the seas&quot;, is printed at the bottom of the shield. This line, a verse from Psalm 24 Verse 2, acknowledges the territory&#x27;s Christian heritage, as well as its ties to the sea.

<doc id="474878" wikidata="Q794036" url="?curid=474878" title="McKeeva Bush">
<text>William McKeeva Bush, (born 20 January 1955) is a Caymanian politician, former Speaker of the Parliament of the Cayman Islands and former Premier of the Cayman Islands. Bush, the former leader of the Cayman Democratic Party, is the elected member for the constituency of West Bay West. He is the territory&#x27;s longest ever serving political figure with service spanning over 35 years, previously serving his tenth term in the Parliament of the Cayman Islands.

==Education==
Bush was educated in the Cayman Islands Government primary and secondary school system. At an early stage in secondary education, Bush dropped out of school. Bush was awarded an honorary master&#x27;s degree in humanities from the International College of the Cayman Islands.

==Political career==
Bush made his first venture into politics in 1980, running for the West Bay seat in the Legislative Assembly. He was unsuccessful that first time, but achieved victory when he ran again for the same seat in 1984. He has held that seat continuously since then, and also later became a member of the Executive Council (ExCo, now called the Cabinet). He also served as Minister for Health and Human Services from 1992 to 1994 and Minister of Community Development, Sports, Women&#x27;s and Youth Affairs and Culture from 1994 to 1997. In 1996, he took a position as a non-executive director of Qatar-based Gulf Union Bank. When the bank was investigated for fraud a year later, the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority revoked its license and wound up its local subsidiary, First Cayman Bank; Bush was criticised for his association with the bank, and resigned from ExCo. First Cayman Bank had made a number of suspicious loans before it collapsed, including a loan of $5 million to its owner and another $10 million to Texas oil businessman Tom Hajecate; a journalist stated that Bush had threatened him with legal action if he continued to pursue the story.
However, Bush remained in politics after that incident. He was a founding member of the United Democratic Party (UDP) in 2001, and served as Minister for Tourism, Environment and Transport from November 2000 to November 2001 and served as the Leader of Government Business and Minister of Tourism, Environment, Development and Commerce from November 2001 to May 2005 during the UDP administration. Following the Cayman Islands general election 2005, he served as the Leader of the Opposition from May 2005 to May 2009.

Bush was elected Premier during the Cayman Islands general election in 2009, and in addition to assuming the post of Premier, he also served as Minister of Finance, Tourism &amp; Development for the former UDP administration. He is currently the longest serving member of the Legislative Assembly of the Cayman Islands and is referred to as the &quot;Father of the House&quot; and &quot;Big Mac&quot;. During his political campaigns, he is also known for singing Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;Lion of Judah&quot; which has become a trademark ending to his political speeches.

Bush is also a Justice of the Peace (JP).

==Investigations and arrest==

Bush has had several run-ins with casino related incidents. In 2010 Bush was accused of using a government issued credit card at casinos in the Bahamas and Florida (where gambling is legally permitted, unlike the Cayman Islands) and incurred over $33,000 in cash transactions. The monies were eventually repaid over a two-year period. During the same year Bush personally spent an additional $57,000 in Las Vegas and a further $45,000 in Florida.

In late 2010 the Royal Cayman Islands Police Service (RCIPS) opened an investigation into Bush relating to alleged financial irregularities dating from October 2004. The former Governor of the Cayman Islands, Duncan Taylor, declined to appoint a commission of enquiry while the police investigation was ongoing.

In April 2012 the RCIPS confirmed that Bush was the subject of three ongoing investigations, including the one revealed in late 2010. RCIPS officers arrested Bush at his home on the morning of 11 December 2012 on suspicion of theft, breach of trust, abuse of office, and conflict of interest. The first charge was related to Bush&#x27;s alleged misuse of a government credit card in Las Vegas for which he was investigated in 2010, while the latter three concerned the importation in February 2012 or earlier of explosives without valid permits. Bush was questioned twice and then freed on bail. He denied any wrongdoing and refused to step down from his post, describing the charges against him as part of a &quot;political witch hunt&quot; led by Governor Duncan and members of the opposition.

On 18 December 2012, Bush was ousted as Premier in an 11–3 vote of no confidence by the Legislative Assembly. All members of the opposition People&#x27;s Progressive Movement as well as five members of Bush&#x27;s own UDP cast votes in favour of his being ousted, while Capt. Eugene Ebanks, Ellio Solomon, and Mike Adams cast the negative votes and Bush himself abstained. Governor Duncan Taylor appointed Bush&#x27;s Deputy Premier, Juliana O&#x27;Connor-Connolly, to replace him as Premier on 19 December 2012.

In October 2014 a jury acquitted him on all charges against him. Mr. Bush has since been found Not-Guilty of corruption by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands in 2014 and was acquitted of all charges made against him.

On 17 July 2017, Bush was arrested by the Seminole Police at a Florida casino on battery charges. The arresting officer stated that surveillance video footage showed Bush wrapping his arm around the victim&#x27;s lower back and forcefully pulling the victim towards him.

On 19 July 2017, Bush was accused of groping a female employee at the Seminole Casino Coconut Creek and was charged with Simple Battery or Misdemeanor Battery. He eventually pled not guilty to the charges and attributed the incident to a case of &quot;Cultural Misunderstanding&quot;. The tribal casino eventually decided not to pursue charges.

In November 2019 he reported that he was the victim of a social media &#x27;hack&#x27; that resulted in him referring to several to various voters as &quot;son of bitches&quot;. He also made allegations that several opponents to the proposed port project were behaving inappropriately.

Although he later got the charges dropped in the 2017 assault case, Bush once again came under fire for assaulting a woman as well as abuse of power in 2020. Late at night on 21 February 2020, multiple witnesses reported Bush physically attacking a woman at the Coral Beach bar on 7 Mile Beach. Reports stated that Bush fell over due to intoxication, and when the female bar manager tried to help him up, he physically attacked her. Witnesses commented on social media reports of the incident, stating that they saw Bush physically hit the woman multiple times in the face. Bush released an apology the following day, blaming the incident on grief from a family death that happened 9 years prior. The public did not accept his apology, however, and the hashtag #SheIsSupported was started to show the anonymous victim that the public supports her if she chooses to speak out and press charges. As of Monday, 24 February 2020, the RCIPS are still investigating the incident and the victim has not made any public statements.

As for the reasons for the public&#x27;s lack of acceptance of Bush&#x27;s most recent apology, it appears to be a combination of repeat offenses and too many witness testimonies of these specific events to be rebutted. As a result, the public is now calling for Bush to either resign or be removed from his position in Government, and barred from any future positions in Government. The public noticed too many inconsistencies between police statements and Bush&#x27;s apology statement to believe what was said. For example, RCIPS stated that ”The parties involved were all said to be present between 8:30 pm on Friday 21 February and 12:30 am on Saturday, 22 February&quot;, which leads the public to believe that Bush&#x27;s statement about only being at Coral Beach to collect takeout was a lie. As of the time of this update, the public is awaiting a statement from the Cayman Islands Government, and/or from any elected member of the government, as no statements have been made since Bush&#x27;s.

On 12 October 2022, Bush resigned as Speaker amid allegations of sexual harassment.
==Personal life==
Bush is married to Kerry Bush (&quot;née&quot; Parsons), whom he met at a Christian youth group while a teenager. The couple had two children: their son Barry, and their daughter, Tonya Yvonne Anglin, who died from diabetes complications on 25 January 2011; she was survived by her husband Chet Anglin and daughter Zariah (Bush&#x27;s granddaughter).

Bush is a director and shareholder of the Cambridge Real Estate Company.

Queen Elizabeth II appointed him an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1997 New Year Honours for his work in the Cayman Islands community and success in the Cayman Islands Government. In 2023, he returned the honour stating &quot;I found myself conflicted about retaining an award that doesn&#x27;t promote Caymanian Excellence but rather one that many people believe celebrated imperialism and perpetuated a system of class and privilege.&quot; The OBE was formally revoked in August 2023.

<doc id="474880" wikidata="Q18570" url="?curid=474880" title="Hawthorne effect">
<text>The Hawthorne effect is a type of human behavior reactivity in which individuals modify an aspect of their behavior in response to their awareness of being observed. The effect was discovered in the context of research conducted at the Hawthorne Western Electric plant; however, some scholars think the descriptions are fictitious.

The original research involved workers who made electrical relays at the Hawthorne Works, a Western Electric plant in Cicero, Illinois. Between 1924 and 1927, the lighting study was conducted, wherein workers experienced a series of lighting changes that were said to increase productivity. This conclusion turned out to be false. In an Elton Mayo study that ran from 1927 to 1928, a series of changes in work structure were implemented (e.g. changes in rest periods) in a group of six women. However, this was a methodologically poor, uncontrolled study from which no firm conclusions could be drawn. Elton Mayo later conducted two additional experiments to study the phenomenon: the mass interviewing experiment (1928-1930) and the bank wiring observation experiment (1931-32).

One of the later interpretations by Henry Landsberger, a sociology professor at UNC-Chapel Hill, suggested that the novelty of being research subjects and the increased attention from such could lead to temporary increases in workers&#x27; productivity. This interpretation was dubbed &quot;the Hawthorne effect&quot;.

== History ==
The term &quot;Hawthorne effect&quot; was coined in 1953 by John R. P. French after the Hawthorne studies were conducted between 1924 and 1932 at the Hawthorne Works (a Western Electric factory in Cicero, outside Chicago). The Hawthorne Works had commissioned a study to determine if its workers would become more productive in brighter or dimmer levels of light. The workers&#x27; productivity seemed to improve when changes were made but returned to their original level when the study ended. It has been alternatively suggested that the workers&#x27; productivity increased because they were motivated by interest being shown in them.

This effect was observed for minute increases in illumination. In these lighting studies, light intensity was altered to examine the resulting effect on worker productivity. When discussing the Hawthorne effect, most industrial and organizational psychology textbooks refer almost exclusively to the illumination studies as opposed to the other types of studies that have been conducted.

Although early studies focused on altering workplace illumination, other changes such as maintaining clean work stations, clearing floors of obstacles, and relocating workstations have also been found to result in increased productivity for short periods of time. Thus, the Hawthorne effect can apply to a cause or causes other than changing lighting.

== Illumination experiment ==
The illumination experiment was conducted from 1924 to 1927. The purpose was to determine the effect of light variations on worker productivity. The experiment ran in two rooms: the experiment room, in which workers went about their workday under various light levels; and the control room, in which workers did their tasks under normal conditions. The hypothesis was that as the light level was increased in the experiment room, productivity would increase.

However, when the intensity of light was increased in the experiment room, researchers found that productivity had improved in &quot;both&quot; rooms. The light level in the experiment room was then decreased, and the results were the same: increased productivity in both rooms. Productivity only began to decrease in the experiment room when the light level was reduced to about the level of moonlight, which made it hard to see.

Ultimately it was concluded that illumination did not have any effect on productivity and that there must have been some other variable causing the observed productivity increases in both rooms. Another phase of experiments was needed to pinpoint the cause.

== Relay assembly experiments ==
In 1927, researchers conducted an experiment where they chose two female workers as test subjects and asked them to choose four other women to join the test group. Until 1928, the team of women worked in a separate room, assembling telephone relays.

Output was measured mechanically by counting how many finished relays each worker dropped down a chute. To establish a baseline productivity level, the measurement was begun in secret two weeks before the women were moved to the experiment room, and then continued sex throughout the study. In the experiment room, a supervisor discussed changes in their productivity. 

Some of the variables were:
* Giving the workers two 5-minute breaks (which they said they preferred beforehand) and then switching to two 10-minute breaks. Productivity increased, but when they were given six 5-minute breaks, productivity decreased because many rests broke the workers&#x27; flow.
* Providing soup or coffee with a sandwich in the morning and snacks in the evening. This increased productivity.
* Changing the end of the workday from 5:00 to 4:30 and eliminating the Saturday workday. This increased productivity.

Changing a variable usually increased productivity, even if the variable was just a change back to the original condition. It is said that this reflects natural adaption to the environment without knowing the objective of the experiment. Researchers concluded that the workers worked harder because they thought that they were being monitored individually.

Researchers hypothesized that choosing one&#x27;s own coworkers, working as a group, being treated as special (as evidenced by working in a separate room), and having a sympathetic supervisor were the real reasons for the productivity increase. One interpretation, mainly due to Elton Mayo&#x27;s studies, was that &quot;the six individuals became a team and the team gave itself wholeheartedly and spontaneously to cooperation in the experiment.&quot; Further, there was a second relay assembly test room study whose results were not as significant as the first experiment.

== Mass interviewing program ==
The program was conducted from 1928 to 1930 and involved 20,000 interviews. The interviews initially used direct questioning, asking questions related to the supervision and policies of the company involved. The drawback of the direct questioning was that the answers were only &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, which was unhelpful for finding the root of problems. Therefore, researchers took to indirect questioning, in which the interviewer would listen. This gave valuable insights about workers&#x27; behavior, specifically that the behavior of a worker (or individual) is shaped by group behavior.

== Bank wiring room experiments ==
The purpose of the next study was to find out how payment incentives and small groups would affect productivity. The surprising result was that productivity actually decreased. Workers apparently had become suspicious that their productivity may have been boosted to justify firing some of the workers later on. The study was conducted by Elton Mayo and W. Lloyd Warner between 1931 and 1932 on a group of fourteen men who put together telephone switching equipment. The researchers found that although the workers were paid according to individual productivity, productivity decreased because the men were afraid that the company would lower the base rate. Detailed observation of the men revealed the existence of informal groups or &quot;cliques&quot; within the formal groups. These cliques developed informal rules of behavior as well as mechanisms to enforce them. The cliques served to control group members and to manage bosses; when bosses asked questions, clique members gave the same responses, even if they were untrue. These results show that workers were more responsive to the social force of their peer groups than to the control and incentives of management.

== Interpretation and criticism ==
Richard Nisbett has described the Hawthorne effect as &quot;a glorified anecdote&quot;, saying that &quot;once you have got the anecdote, you can throw away the data.&quot; Other researchers have attempted to explain the effects with various interpretations. J. G. Adair warned of gross factual inaccuracy in most secondary publications on the Hawthorne effect and that many studies failed to find it. He argued that it should be viewed as a variant of Orne&#x27;s (1973) experimental demand effect. For Adair, the Hawthorne effect depended on the participants&#x27; interpretation of the situation. An implication is that manipulation checks are important in social sciences experiments. He advanced the view that awareness of being observed was not the source of the effect, but participants&#x27; interpretation of the situation is critical. How did the participants&#x27; interpretation of the situation interact with the participants&#x27; goals? 

Possible explanations for the Hawthorne effect include the impact of feedback and motivation towards the experimenter. Receiving feedback on their performance may improve their skills when an experiment provides this feedback for the first time. Research on the demand effect also suggests that people may be motivated to please the experimenter, at least if it does not conflict with any other motive. They may also be suspicious of the purpose of the experimenter. Therefore, Hawthorne effect may only occur when there is usable feedback or a change in motivation.

Parsons defined the Hawthorne effect as &quot;the confounding that occurs if experimenters fail to realize how the consequences of subjects&#x27; performance affect what subjects do&quot; [i.e. learning effects, both permanent skill improvement and feedback-enabled adjustments to suit current goals]. His key argument was that in the studies where workers dropped their finished goods down chutes, the participants had access to the counters of their work rate.

Mayo contended that the effect was due to the workers reacting to the sympathy and interest of the observers. He discussed the study as demonstrating an experimenter effect as a management effect: how management can make workers perform differently because they feel differently. He suggested that much of the Hawthorne effect concerned the workers feeling free and in control as a group rather than as being supervised. The experimental manipulations were important in convincing the workers to feel that conditions in the special five-person work group were actually different from the conditions on the shop floor. The study was repeated with similar effects on mica-splitting workers.

Clark and Sugrue in a review of educational research reported that uncontrolled novelty effects cause on average 30% of a standard deviation (SD) rise (i.e. 50–63% score rise), with the rise decaying to a much smaller effect after 8 weeks. In more detail: 50% of a SD for up to 4 weeks; 30% of SD for 5–8 weeks; and 20% of SD for &gt; 8 weeks, (which is &lt; 1% of the variance).

Harry Braverman pointed out that the Hawthorne tests were based on industrial psychology and the researchers involved were investigating whether workers&#x27; performance could be predicted by pre-hire testing. The Hawthorne study showed &quot;that the performance of workers had little relation to their ability and in fact often bore an inverse relation to test scores ...&quot;. Braverman argued that the studies really showed that the workplace was not &quot;a system of bureaucratic formal organisation on the Weberian model, nor a system of informal group relations, as in the interpretation of Mayo and his followers but rather a system of power, of class antagonisms&quot;. This discovery was a blow to those hoping to apply the behavioral sciences to manipulate workers in the interest of management.

The economists Steven Levitt and John A. List long pursued without success a search for the base data of the original illumination experiments (they were not true experiments but some authors labeled them experiments), before finding it in a microfilm at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee in 2011. Re-analysing it, they found slight evidence for the Hawthorne effect over the long-run, but in no way as drastic as suggested initially. This finding supported the analysis of an article by S. R. G. Jones in 1992 examining the relay experiments. Despite the absence of evidence for the Hawthorne effect in the original study, List has said that he remains confident that the effect is genuine.

Gustav Wickström and Tom Bendix (2000) argue that the supposed &quot;Hawthorne effect&quot; is actually ambiguous and disputable, and instead recommend that to evaluate intervention effectiveness, researchers should introduce specific psychological and social variables that may have affected the outcome.

It is also possible that the illumination experiments can be explained by a longitudinal learning effect. Parsons has declined to analyse the illumination experiments, on the grounds that they have not been properly published and so he cannot get at details, whereas he had extensive personal communication with Roethlisberger and Dickson.

Evaluation of the Hawthorne effect continues in the present day. Despite the criticisms, however, the phenomenon is often taken into account when designing studies and their conclusions. Some have also developed ways to avoid it. For instance, there is the case of holding the observation when conducting a field study from a distance, from behind a barrier such as a two-way mirror or using an unobtrusive measure.

Greenwood, Bolton, and Greenwood (1983) interviewed some of the participants in the experiments and found that the participants were paid significantly better. Bolton&#x27;s archives relevant to his work on the Hawthorne Effect are held at West Virginia University.

==Trial effect==
Various medical scientists have studied possible trial effect (clinical trial effect) in clinical trials. Some postulate that, beyond just attention and observation, there may be other factors involved, such as slightly better care; slightly better compliance/adherence; and selection bias. The latter may have several mechanisms: (1) Physicians may tend to recruit patients who seem to have better adherence potential and lesser likelihood of future loss to follow-up. (2) The inclusion/exclusion criteria of trials often exclude at least some comorbidities; although this is often necessary to prevent confounding, it also means that trials may tend to work with healthier patient subpopulations.

== Secondary observer effect ==

Despite the observer effect as popularized in the Hawthorne experiments being perhaps falsely identified (see above discussion), the popularity and plausibility of the observer effect in theory has led researchers to postulate that this effect could take place at a second level. Thus it has been proposed that there is a secondary observer effect when researchers working with secondary data such as survey data or various indicators may impact the results of their scientific research. Rather than having an effect on the subjects (as with the primary observer effect), the researchers likely have their own idiosyncrasies that influence how they handle the data and even what data they obtain from secondary sources. For one, the researchers may choose seemingly innocuous steps in their statistical analyses that end up causing significantly different results using the same data; e.g. weighting strategies, factor analytic techniques, or choice of estimation. In addition, researchers may use software packages that have different default settings that lead to small but significant fluctuations. Finally, the data that researchers use may not be identical, even though it seems so. For example, the OECD collects and distributes various socio-economic data; however, these data change over time such that a researcher who downloads the Australian GDP data for the year 2000 may have slightly different values than a researcher who downloads the same Australian GDP 2000 data a few years later. The idea of the secondary observer effect was floated by Nate Breznau in a thus far relatively obscure paper.

Although little attention has been paid to this phenomenon, the scientific implications are very large. Evidence of this effect may be seen in recent studies that assign a particular problem to a number of researchers or research teams who then work independently using the same data to try and find a solution. This is a process called crowdsourcing data analysis and was used in a groundbreaking study by Silberzahn, Rafael, Eric Uhlmann, Dan Martin and Brian Nosek et al. (2015) about red cards and player race in football (i.e. soccer).

<text>Pound Hill is one of 14 neighbourhoods within the town of Crawley in West Sussex, England. Pound Hill is located on the east of Crawley. It is bordered by Three Bridges and Manor Royal to the west and Maidenbower to the south.

It is the largest of the 13 neighbourhoods of Crawley. Until 2004, it was the first one to be split into two wards - Pound Hill North and Pound Hill South. Its boundaries extend north beyond the main built-up area thus making it also the most northerly neighbourhood in the town.

==History==
Pound Hill was originally a hamlet within the parish of Worth. In 1809 an Act of Parliament created a turnpike between Horley and Balcombe, this road (now called the Balcombe Road) entered the parish from the North and at the top of Pound Hill it turned east and followed the Crawley to Turners Hill road, after a few hundred yards the road then turned south along Church Lane in Worth. The houses and farms around the &quot;Pound Hill&quot; junction became known as Pound Hill. Due to the close proximity of Worth Church, Pound Hill did not develop into a village. The turnpike was busy and the hill leading down Church Lane became difficult for wheeled vehicles. Church Lane was bypassed when a new road was made directly south from Pound Hill junction to join the old road at the bottom of the hill near Frogshole Farm. A public house the &quot;Kings Head&quot; became a popular stopping place for coaches between London and Brighton. But by the 1830s the &quot;Kings Head&quot; had become a private house and most of the coaches used the new turnpike through Crawley.

By 1916 a telephone exchange had been built in Pound Hill.

In the 1920s and 1930s a number of large estates in the area were sold and land became available for development. In Pound Hill 102 houses were built along St Mary&#x27;s Drive. Although further land was cleared the development in the area was stopped by the Second World War. Post-war further houses were built around St Mary&#x27;s Drive.

With the creation of Crawley New Town in 1947 the Pound Hill area was proposed as a neighbourhood. It not only included the original area of Pound Hill but all the land between the London-Brighton railway and the Balcombe Road, and south from Crawley Avenue to the Three Bridges-East Grinstead Railway. And later it included the area around Worth church. Work began and building new houses around 1953 and the southern part of Pound Hill was completed in 1956. Development of the northern part continued into the 1970s. Also in the 1970s the area to the east between the Balcombe Road and the M23 motorway was developed and other areas were infilled. In 1981 Pound Hill had 11,617 inhabitants. A school in the area collapsed under the weight of a severe storm that hit Britain on 25 January 1990, but all pupils had been evacuated just minutes before the building collapsed. 

==Today==
Pound Hill has a wide variety of housing from small flats to very large modern houses.

The area of Worth is within the boundaries of Pound Hill; this was official recognition with the renaming of &#x27;Pound Hill South&#x27; in 2004 to &#x27;Pound Hill South and Worth&#x27;. It is common for signposts to be altered to use the Worth name by local residents.

Worth Park Gardens is a large recreational parkland located within Pound Hill and dates back to 1882. It hosts several listed buildings and is the home of The Crawley Croquet Club. 

===Music===
Pound Hill was formerly the home of Robert Smith of rock band The Cure.

<text>Maximumrocknroll, often written as Maximum Rocknroll and usually abbreviated as MRR, is a not-for-profit monthly online zine of punk subculture and radio show of punk music. Based in San Francisco, &quot;MRR&quot; focuses on punk rock and hardcore music, and primarily features artist interviews and music reviews. Op/ed columns and news roundups are regular features as well, including submissions from international contributors. By 1990, it &quot;had become the de facto bible of the scene&quot;. &quot;MRR&quot; is considered to be one of the most important zines in punk, not only because of its wide-ranging coverage, but because it has been a consistent and influential presence in the ever-changing punk community for over three decades. From 1992 to 2011, it published a guide called &quot;Book Your Own Fuckin&#x27; Life&quot;.

An announcement on the MRR website in January 2019 stated &quot;It is with heavy hearts that we are announcing the end of Maximum Rocknroll as a monthly print fanzine. There will be three more issues of the fanzine in its current format; later in 2019 we will begin publishing record reviews online alongside our weekly radio show.&quot;

==History==

===Background===

&quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot; originated as punk radio show on Berkeley&#x27;s KPFA in 1977 but it is in its zine form that &quot;MRR&quot; exerted its greatest influence and became as close to an institution as punk ideology allows. It was founded by Tim Yohannan in 1982 as the newsprint booklet insert in &quot;Not So Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, a compilation LP released on the then-Dead Kennedys&#x27; label Alternative Tentacles. The compilation included forty-seven bands from Northern California and nearby areas.

The first issues focused on the local and regional music scenes, but the coverage soon expanded to the entire continent and, by issue five, cover stories included features on Brazilian and Dutch underground punk. In the &#x27;80s, &quot;MRR&quot; was one of the very few US fanzines that insisted on the international scope of the punk movement, and strove to cover scenes around the world. Today the zine has surpassed its 400th issue, and continues to include international content and a strong political bent. It also includes artist interviews, letters, commentary, guest columnists, and extensive sections for independent reviews of punk recordings, demos, books, films, videos, and other zines.

In 1987, &quot;MRR&quot; published a photo zine of hardcore bands, &quot;If Life Is a Bowl of Cherries, What Am I Doing in the Pit?&quot; The first regular issue devoted entirely to photography was published in 2010.

Along with the published (and later online) zine, MRR also produces a weekly radio show called MRR Radio which was played on multiple radio stations. The format of the show consists of at least one DJ playing punk rock songs for about an hour. 

===Criticism===

The fact that &quot;MRR&quot; has become so large has not been without controversy: the zine has many critics on a number of issues. Editorial policy has sometimes been accused as narrow-minded or even elitist, causing some labels to boycott advertising in the zine or sending releases for review. The fact that punk is often considered as a movement opposed to authority and large institutions (see punk ideology) has also been an argument used to criticize the zine, which has sometimes been referred to as the &quot;Bible of Punk&quot;.

Musicians have also spoken out against the magazine. Jello Biafra claimed the magazine&#x27;s criticism of him inspired people to assault him at a 1994 performance at 924 Gilman Street, though his assailants were not known to be affiliated with &quot;MRR&quot; in any way. He also claimed that their narrow definition of punk music amounts to a new form of political correctness. According to Biafra, &quot;If &#x27;Holiday in Cambodia&#x27; were released today, it would be banned from &quot;Maximum Rock N&#x27;Roll&quot; for not sounding punk.&quot; Jared Swilley, bassist in Atlanta punk band Black Lips, has criticized the magazine saying in an interview with &quot;Clash&quot; that it is the &quot;most bullshit piece of fuck garbage poor excuse for a magazine ever. They’re like: ‘Oh, we want to keep everything ‘authentic’...’ And I’m like, fuck them! Don’t use a computer, don’t use a car, don’t drink Coca-Cola. Move to a field, grow your own food.&quot;

&quot;Against Me&quot;&#x27;s frontwoman, Laura Jane Grace, wrote in her autobiography that &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot; had urged readers to sabotage their performances and that she quoted the article in a court case over a fight before a gig in Tallahassee to demonstrate the hostility against her.

<text>The death of Bridget Driscoll ( Swift; c. 185117 August 1896) was the first recorded case of a pedestrian killed in a collision with a motor car in Great Britain. 

Driscoll was born in Ireland but living in Surrey with her husband and children at the time of her death. She had planned a three-day trip to London to attend a League of the Cross festival. She was in the company of her teenage daughter May and her friend Elizabeth Murphy and was crossing Dolphin Terrace in the grounds of the Crystal Palace in London when she was struck by the driver of a car belonging to the Anglo-French Motor Carriage Company that was being used to give demonstration rides. One witness described the car as being driven at &quot;a reckless pace, in fact, like a fire engine&quot;.

Although the car&#x27;s maximum speed was , it had been limited deliberately to , the speed at which the driver, Arthur James Edsall of Upper Norwood, claimed to have been travelling. His passenger, Alice Standing of Forest Hill, alleged he modified the engine to allow the car to go faster, but another taxicab driver examined the car and said it was incapable of exceeding because of a low-speed engine belt. The collision happened just a few weeks after a new Act of Parliament had increased the speed limit for cars to , from 2 miles per hour in towns and 4 miles per hour in the countryside.
The jury returned a verdict of &quot;accidental death&quot; after an inquest lasting some six hours. The coroner, Percy Morrison (Croydon division of Surrey), said he hoped &quot;such a thing would never happen again&quot;. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents estimated 550,000 people had been killed on UK roads by 2010.

<doc id="474894" wikidata="Q60930" url="?curid=474894" title="Ponthieu">
<text>Ponthieu (, , Picard: &quot;Ponthiu&quot;) was one of six feudal counties that eventually merged to become part of the Province of Picardy, in northern France. Its chief town is Abbeville.

== History ==
Ponthieu played a small but important role in the politics that led up to the Norman invasion of England in 1066.

=== Norman conquest of England ===

In 1064 Edward the Confessor sent Harold Godwinson to Normandy in order to recognize its duke William as his successor. However, Harold shipwrecked at Ponthieu, where he was taken captive by Guy I (or Wido according to the Bayeux Tapestry), the then Count of Ponthieu. It is alleged that William (Duke of Normandy, later William I of England), discovering that Harold had been taken captive, persuaded Count Guy to hand over his prisoner. Harold then swore to support William&#x27;s claim to the throne, and joined the duke in his brief campaign in Brittany before returning to England.

In 1067 the chaplain of Matilda of Flanders, Guy, Bishop of Amiens, composed Carmen de Hastingae Proelio, a Latin poem on the battle of Hastings.

In 1150 the Count of Ponthieu built a fortress for himself at Crotoy, a strategic point on the mouth of the river Somme.

=== The Hundred Years&#x27; War ===
During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Ponthieu changed hands a number of times, although the English claimed control of it from 1279–1369, and then later until 1435. During English control of Ponthieu, Abbeville was used as the capital.

In late August 1346, during his campaigns on French soil, Edward III of England reached the region of Ponthieu. While there, he restored the fortress at Crotoy that had been ruined. He forced a passage of the Somme at the ford of Blanchetaque. The army led by Philip VI of France caught up with him at nearby Crécy-en-Ponthieu, leading to the famous Battle of Crécy.

In 1360, the Treaty of Brétigny between King John II of France and Edward III of England gave control of Ponthieu (along with Gascony and Calais) over to the English, in exchange for Edward relinquishing his claim to the French throne. Edward took the land but still refused to surrender his claim.

In April, 1369 Charles V of France conquered Ponthieu, and a month later declared war on England (he had done so previously in 1368 as well). As a result, Edward publicly reassumed the title &#x27;King of France&#x27; in June.

In 1372 an English army under the leadership of Robert Knolles invaded Ponthieu, burning the city of Le Crotoy before crossing the Somme at the ford of Blanchetaque.

Also during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, in the Treaty of Arras (1435), Charles VII of France bribed Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, to break his alliance with the English in exchange for possession of Ponthieu. This arguably marked a turning point that led to the end of England&#x27;s part in the conflict 40 years later.

In 1477 Ponthieu was reconquered by King Louis XI of France.

==Counts of Ponthieu==
== Cultural references ==
Renaissance Ponthieu, specifically Abbeville, is the setting for the 1993 film &quot;The Hour of the Pig&quot;, which was released in the US as &quot;The Advocate&quot; and stars Colin Firth. Part of the action turns on the difference in the Renaissance era between Ponthieu law and that of France, which was then a separate kingdom.

<text>Leeds East Airport Church Fenton , formerly RAF Church Fenton, is an airport and former Royal Air Force station located south-east of Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England and north-west of Selby, North Yorkshire, near the village of Church Fenton. The airport has had a licensing application from the UK Civil Aviation Authority rejected. This led to the scrapping of plans to allow regular scheduled passenger flights and charter flights to various European destinations. The airport has subsequently been awarded an operating licence for private use.

==History==

=== RAF Church Fenton ===

The airfield was originally a Royal Air Force station known as RAF Church Fenton. It opened on 1 April 1937 when the station was declared open and on 19 April the first station commander Wing Commander W.E. Swann assumed command. Within two months No. 71 Squadron RAF had arrived with the Gloster Gladiator.

It saw the peak of its activity during the years of the Second World War, when it served within the defence network of fighter bases of the RAF providing protection for the Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield and Humber estuary industrial regions.

After the war it at first retained its role as a fighter base, being among the first to receive modern jet aircraft, namely the Gloster Meteor and the Hawker Hunter. In later years, its role was mainly flight training. No. 7 Flying Training School was based here between 1962 and 1966 and again between 1979 and 1992, equipped with Hunting Aircraft Jet Provost T3 trainers.

For some years it was home to the Royal Navy Elementary Flying Training School (RNEFTS) using the Scottish Aviation Bulldog, and again 1979–1992, triggered by the introduction of the Panavia Tornado, being the first station to receive the new turboprop-powered Short Tucano T.1 basic fast jet trainers. From 1998 to 2003 Church Fenton was the RAF&#x27;s main Elementary Flying Training airfield.

===Station closure===
The last Station Commander of a self-determining RAF Church Fenton was Squadron Leader David Morris, who had trained on Chipmunk aircraft at RAF Church Fenton in 1973. Sqn Ldr Morris returned to RAF Church Fenton in 1991 as the Officer Commanding Station Services Squadron, to prepare the as then autonomous station for yet another closure, and transfer into the control of RAF Linton on Ouse as a satellite airfield and Enhanced Relief Landing Ground.

The gates of the fully independent RAF Church Fenton were closed at 12:00 on 31 December 1992, However, with its assets such as the Officers&#x27; Mess subsequently razed to the ground to save on maintenance and the married quarters and other buildings sold off piecemeal by the MoD, RAF Church Fenton&#x27;s runways and aviation infrastructure were alienated from the remainder of the administrative site and remained operational until 2013. 

On 25 March 2013 it was announced that RAF Church Fenton would close by the end of 2013. The units would be relocated to RAF Linton on Ouse by 31 December 2013. By 19 December 2013, all units had relocated and the airfield was closed. Some equipment was to be relocated to RAF Topcliffe. MoD security continued to secure the site until disposal. A NOTAM was issued suspending the air traffic zone (ATZ) at the end of 2013.

==Current use==

The site was sold on 23 December 2014 to Makins Yorkshire Strawberries except for a section containing the Air Cadets. Makins intends to keep the airfield operational.

In February 2015, Makins Enterprises (the new airfield owners) launched their new website, renaming the airfield as &#x27;Leeds East Airport&#x27;, with the slogan &quot;Yorkshire&#x27;s newest aviation destination.&quot; Makins was planning on targeting the business jet market, while also running a flying school and other ventures.

The second series of the ITV drama &quot;Victoria&quot; was shot at a hangar onsite in 2017. In June 2023, the site was granted planning permission to develop alongside the existing hangars into three sound stages/studios and office space. The owners hope to make the site a &quot;state-of-the-art commercial TV and film studio facility, creating opportunities for the creative, digital and media industries.&quot;

<doc id="474905" wikidata="Q867226" url="?curid=474905" title="Tincture of iodine">
<text>Tincture of iodine, iodine tincture, or weak iodine solution is an antiseptic. It is usually 2 to 3% elemental iodine, along with potassium iodide or sodium iodide, dissolved in a mixture of ethanol and water. Tincture solutions are characterized by the presence of alcohol. It was used from 1908 in pre-operative skin preparation by Italian surgeon Antonio Grossich.

In the United Kingdom, the development of an iodine solution for skin sterilisation was pioneered by Lionel Stretton. The &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; published the detail of his work at Kidderminster Infirmary in 1909. Stretton used a much weaker solution than that used by Grossich. He claimed in 1915 that Grossich had been using a liquid akin to Liquor Iodi Fortis, and that it was he, Stretton, who had introduced the method using Tincture of Iodine BP which came to be used across the world.
== USP formulas ==

USP Tincture of Iodine is defined in the U.S. National Formulary (NF) as containing in each 100 mL, 1.8 to 2.2 grams of elemental iodine, and 2.1 to 2.6 grams of sodium iodide. Alcohol is 50 mL, and the balance is purified water. This &quot;2% free iodine&quot; solution has 0.08 mol/L of I2, which provides about 1 mg of free iodine per 0.05 mL drop. The &quot;2% free iodine&quot; description is based on the quantity of elemental iodine, not sodium/potassium iodide.

USP Strong Iodine Tincture is defined in the NF as containing in each 100 mL, 6.8 to 7.5 gram of iodine, and 4.7 to 5.5 gram of potassium iodide. Purified water is 50 mL and the balance is alcohol. This 7% tincture solution is about 3.5 times more concentrated than USP 2% tincture.

As in the case of Lugol&#x27;s iodine, the role of iodide in the solution is to increase the solubility of the elemental iodine, by turning it to the soluble triiodide anion I3−. However, since iodine has moderate solubility in ethanol, it is also assisted by this solvent directly. Lugol&#x27;s iodine, by contrast, has no alcohol, and has twice the mass of potassium iodide as of elemental iodine. Alcohol content in the tincture of iodine can be determined by the methods of Alcock, Roscoe – Schorlemmer and Thurston – Thurston.

== Usage ==

As both USP solutions contain elemental iodine, which is moderately toxic when ingested in amounts larger than those required to disinfect water, tincture of iodine is sold labelled “for external use only,” and used primarily as a disinfectant.

Tincture of iodine is often found in emergency survival kits, used both to disinfect wounds and to sanitize surface water for drinking. When an alcohol solution is not desirable for this purpose, the alcohol-free Lugol&#x27;s iodine, an aqueous solution of iodine in potassium iodide solution, or else povidone-iodine (brand names Wokadine, Betadine), a PVPI solution, can be used.

Small amounts may be added to suspect drinking water as a disinfectant (typically 5 mg free iodine per liter, or 5 drops of 2% tincture). Though this treatment is effective against bacteria and viruses, it does not protect against protozoan parasites such as &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; and &quot;Giardia&quot;.

Iodine solution is used to sanitize the surface of fruit and vegetables from bacteria and viruses. The common concentration for sanitization is 25 ppm iodophor for 1 minute. However, the effectiveness depends on whether the solution penetrates into rifts, and whether dirt is effectively removed at first. The oocytes of protozoan parasites will not be killed, and it is also doubtful that bacterial spores will be killed. Iodine solutions should not be considered able to sanitize or disinfect salad, fruit or vegetables that are contaminated with feces.

Iodine tincture is not a recommended source of solely-nutritional iodine. Nutritional iodine is better supplied in the form of the less toxic iodide (see SSKI) or iodate salts, which the body can easily convert to thyroid hormone.

Nevertheless, the iodide in tincture of iodine used as a water disinfectant does supply more than adequate nutritional iodine, perhaps 30 or more times the recommended daily allowance per liter or quart. Application of tincture or Lugol&#x27;s to the skin also results in absorption and bioavailability of some moderate fraction of the iodine. This method can be used to saturate the thyroid with iodine to help prevent the excessive uptake of radioactive iodine-131 in a nuclear accident.

<doc id="474908" wikidata="Q4116110" url="?curid=474908" title="Structural alignment">
<text>Structural alignment attempts to establish homology between two or more polymer structures based on their shape and three-dimensional conformation. This process is usually applied to protein tertiary structures but can also be used for large RNA molecules. In contrast to simple structural superposition, where at least some equivalent residues of the two structures are known, structural alignment requires no &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge of equivalent positions. Structural alignment is a valuable tool for the comparison of proteins with low sequence similarity, where evolutionary relationships between proteins cannot be easily detected by standard sequence alignment techniques. Structural alignment can therefore be used to imply evolutionary relationships between proteins that share very little common sequence. However, caution should be used in using the results as evidence for shared evolutionary ancestry because of the possible confounding effects of convergent evolution by which multiple unrelated amino acid sequences converge on a common tertiary structure.

Structural alignments can compare two sequences or multiple sequences. Because these alignments rely on information about all the query sequences&#x27; three-dimensional conformations, the method can only be used on sequences where these structures are known. These are usually found by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. It is possible to perform a structural alignment on structures produced by structure prediction methods. Indeed, evaluating such predictions often requires a structural alignment between the model and the true known structure to assess the model&#x27;s quality. Structural alignments are especially useful in analyzing data from structural genomics and proteomics efforts, and they can be used as comparison points to evaluate alignments produced by purely sequence-based bioinformatics methods.

The outputs of a structural alignment are a superposition of the atomic coordinate sets and a minimal root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the structures. The RMSD of two aligned structures indicates their divergence from one another. Structural alignment can be complicated by the existence of multiple protein domains within one or more of the input structures, because changes in relative orientation of the domains between two structures to be aligned can artificially inflate the RMSD.

==Data produced by structural alignment==

The minimum information produced from a successful structural alignment is a set of residues that are considered equivalent between the structures. This set of equivalences is then typically used to superpose the three-dimensional coordinates for each input structure. (Note that one input element may be fixed as a reference and therefore its superposed coordinates do not change.) The fitted structures can be used to calculate mutual RMSD values, as well as other more sophisticated measures of structural similarity such as the global distance test (GDT, the metric used in CASP). The structural alignment also implies a corresponding one-dimensional sequence alignment from which a sequence identity, or the percentage of residues that are identical between the input structures, can be calculated as a measure of how closely the two sequences are related.

==Types of comparisons==
Because protein structures are composed of amino acids whose side chains are linked by a common protein backbone, a number of different possible subsets of the atoms that make up a protein macromolecule can be used in producing a structural alignment and calculating the corresponding RMSD values. When aligning structures with very different sequences, the side chain atoms generally are not taken into account because their identities differ between many aligned residues. For this reason it is common for structural alignment methods to use by default only the backbone atoms included in the peptide bond. For simplicity and efficiency, often only the alpha carbon positions are considered, since the peptide bond has a minimally variant planar conformation. Only when the structures to be aligned are highly similar or even identical is it meaningful to align side-chain atom positions, in which case the RMSD reflects not only the conformation of the protein backbone but also the rotameric states of the side chains. Other comparison criteria that reduce noise and bolster positive matches include secondary structure assignment, native contact maps or residue interaction patterns, measures of side chain packing, and measures of hydrogen bond retention.

===Structural superposition===
The most basic possible comparison between protein structures makes no attempt to align the input structures and requires a precalculated alignment as input to determine which of the residues in the sequence are intended to be considered in the RMSD calculation. Structural superposition is commonly used to compare multiple conformations of the same protein (in which case no alignment is necessary, since the sequences are the same) and to evaluate the quality of alignments produced using only sequence information between two or more sequences whose structures are known. This method traditionally uses a simple least-squares fitting algorithm, in which the optimal rotations and translations are found by minimizing the sum of the squared distances among all structures in the superposition. More recently, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods have greatly increased the accuracy of the estimated rotations, translations, and covariance matrices for the superposition.

Algorithms based on multidimensional rotations and modified quaternions have been developed to identify topological relationships between protein structures without the need for a predetermined alignment. Such algorithms have successfully identified canonical folds such as the four-helix bundle. The SuperPose method is sufficiently extensible to correct for relative domain rotations and other structural pitfalls.

===Evaluating similarity===
Often the purpose of seeking a structural superposition is not so much the superposition itself, but an evaluation of the similarity of two structures or a confidence in a remote alignment. A subtle but important distinction from maximal structural superposition is the conversion of an alignment to a meaningful similarity score. Most methods output some sort of &quot;score&quot; indicating the quality of the superposition. However, what one actually wants is &quot;not&quot; merely an &quot;estimated&quot; &quot;Z-score&quot; or an &quot;estimated&quot; E-value of seeing the observed superposition by chance but instead one desires that the &quot;estimated&quot; E-value is tightly correlated to the true E-value. Critically, even if a method&#x27;s estimated E-value is precisely correct &quot;on average&quot;, if it lacks a low standard deviation on its estimated value generation process, then the rank ordering of the relative similarities of a query protein to a comparison set will rarely agree with the &quot;true&quot; ordering.

Different methods will superimpose different numbers of residues because they use different quality assurances and different definitions of &quot;overlap&quot;; some only include residues meeting multiple local and global superposition criteria and others are more greedy, flexible, and promiscuous. A greater number of atoms superposed can mean more similarity but it may not always produce the best E-value quantifying the unlikeliness of the superposition and thus not as useful for assessing similarity, especially in remote homologs.

==Algorithmic complexity==

===Optimal solution===
The optimal &quot;threading&quot; of a protein sequence onto a known structure and the production of an optimal multiple sequence alignment have been shown to be NP-complete. However, this does not imply that the structural alignment problem is NP-complete. Strictly speaking, an optimal solution to the protein structure alignment problem is only known for certain protein structure similarity measures, such as the measures used in protein structure prediction experiments, GDT_TS and MaxSub. These measures can be rigorously optimized using an algorithm capable of maximizing the number of atoms in two proteins that can be superimposed under a predefined distance cutoff. Unfortunately, the algorithm for optimal solution is not practical, since its running time depends not only on the lengths but also on the intrinsic geometry of input proteins.

===Approximate solution===
Approximate polynomial-time algorithms for structural alignment that produce a family of &quot;optimal&quot; solutions within an approximation parameter for a given scoring function have been developed. Although these algorithms theoretically classify the approximate protein structure alignment problem as &quot;tractable&quot;, they are still computationally too expensive for large-scale protein structure analysis. As a consequence, practical algorithms that converge to the global solutions of the alignment, given a scoring function, do not exist. Most algorithms are, therefore, heuristic, but algorithms that guarantee the convergence to at least local maximizers of the scoring functions, and are practical, have been developed.

==Representation of structures==
Protein structures have to be represented in some coordinate-independent space to make them comparable. This is typically achieved by constructing a sequence-to-sequence matrix or series of matrices that encompass comparative metrics: rather than absolute distances relative to a fixed coordinate space. An intuitive representation is the distance matrix, which is a two-dimensional matrix containing all pairwise distances between some subset of the atoms in each structure (such as the alpha carbons). The matrix increases in dimensionality as the number of structures to be simultaneously aligned increases. Reducing the protein to a coarse metric such as secondary structure elements (SSEs) or structural fragments can also produce sensible alignments, despite the loss of information from discarding distances, as noise is also discarded. Choosing a representation to facilitate computation is critical to developing an efficient alignment mechanism.

==Methods==
Structural alignment techniques have been used in comparing individual structures or sets of structures as well as in the production of &quot;all-to-all&quot; comparison databases that measure the divergence between every pair of structures present in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Such databases are used to classify proteins by their fold.

===DALI===
A common and popular structural alignment method is the DALI, or Distance-matrix ALIgnment method, which breaks the input structures into hexapeptide fragments and calculates a distance matrix by evaluating the contact patterns between successive fragments. Secondary structure features that involve residues that are contiguous in sequence appear on the matrix&#x27;s main diagonal; other diagonals in the matrix reflect spatial contacts between residues that are not near each other in the sequence. When these diagonals are parallel to the main diagonal, the features they represent are parallel; when they are perpendicular, their features are antiparallel. This representation is memory-intensive because the features in the square matrix are symmetrical (and thus redundant) about the main diagonal.

When two proteins&#x27; distance matrices share the same or similar features in approximately the same positions, they can be said to have similar folds with similar-length loops connecting their secondary structure elements. DALI&#x27;s actual alignment process requires a similarity search after the two proteins&#x27; distance matrices are built; this is normally conducted via a series of overlapping submatrices of size 6x6. Submatrix matches are then reassembled into a final alignment via a standard score-maximization algorithm — the original version of DALI used a Monte Carlo simulation to maximize a structural similarity score that is a function of the distances between putative corresponding atoms. In particular, more distant atoms within corresponding features are exponentially downweighted to reduce the effects of noise introduced by loop mobility, helix torsions, and other minor structural variations. Because DALI relies on an all-to-all distance matrix, it can account for the possibility that structurally aligned features might appear in different orders within the two sequences being compared.

The DALI method has also been used to construct a database known as FSSP (Fold classification based on Structure-Structure alignment of Proteins, or Families of Structurally Similar Proteins) in which all known protein structures are aligned with each other to determine their structural neighbors and fold classification. There is a searchable database based on DALI as well as a downloadable program and web search based on a standalone version known as DaliLite.

===Combinatorial extension===
The combinatorial extension (CE) method is similar to DALI in that it too breaks each structure in the query set into a series of fragments that it then attempts to reassemble into a complete alignment. A series of pairwise combinations of fragments called aligned fragment pairs, or AFPs, are used to define a similarity matrix through which an optimal path is generated to identify the final alignment. Only AFPs that meet given criteria for local similarity are included in the matrix as a means of reducing the necessary search space and thereby increasing efficiency. A number of similarity metrics are possible; the original definition of the CE method included only structural superpositions and inter-residue distances but has since been expanded to include local environmental properties such as secondary structure, solvent exposure, hydrogen-bonding patterns, and dihedral angles.

An alignment path is calculated as the optimal path through the similarity matrix by linearly progressing through the sequences and extending the alignment with the next possible high-scoring AFP pair. The initial AFP pair that nucleates the alignment can occur at any point in the sequence matrix. Extensions then proceed with the next AFP that meets given distance criteria restricting the alignment to low gap sizes. The size of each AFP and the maximum gap size are required input parameters but are usually set to empirically determined values of 8 and 30 respectively. Like DALI and SSAP, CE has been used to construct an all-to-all fold classification database from the known protein structures in the PDB.

The RCSB PDB has recently released an updated version of CE, Mammoth, and FATCAT as part of the RCSB PDB Protein Comparison Tool. It provides a new variation of CE that can detect circular permutations in protein structures.

===Mammoth===
MAMMOTH approaches the alignment problem from a different objective than almost all other methods. Rather than trying to find an alignment that maximally superimposes the largest number of residues, it seeks the subset of the structural alignment least likely to occur by chance. To do this it marks a local motif alignment with flags to indicate which residues simultaneously satisfy more stringent criteria: 1) Local structure overlap 2) regular secondary structure 3) 3D-superposition 4) same ordering in primary sequence. It converts the statistics of the number of residues with high-confidence matches and the size of the protein to compute an Expectation value for the outcome by chance. It excels at matching remote homologs, particularly structures generated by ab initio structure prediction to structure families such as SCOP, because it emphasizes extracting a statistically reliable sub alignment and not in achieving the maximal sequence alignment or maximal 3D superposition.

For every overlapping window of 7 consecutive residues it computes the set of displacement direction unit vectors between adjacent C-alpha residues. All-against-all local motifs are compared based on the URMS score. These values becomes the pair alignment score entries for dynamic programming which produces a seed pair-wise residue alignment. The second phase uses a modified MaxSub algorithm: a single 7 reside aligned pair in each proteins is used to orient the two full length protein structures to maximally superimpose these just these 7 C-alpha, then in this orientation it scans for any additional aligned pairs that are close in 3D. It re-orients the structures to superimpose this expanded set and iterates until no more pairs coincide in 3D. This process is restarted for every 7 residue window in the seed alignment. The output is the maximal number of atoms found from any of these initial seeds. This statistic is converted to a calibrated E-value for the similarity of the proteins.

Mammoth makes no attempt to re-iterate the initial alignment or extend the high quality sub-subset. Therefore, the seed alignment it displays can&#x27;t be fairly compared to DALI or TM align as it was formed simply as a heuristic to prune the search space. (It can be used if one wants an alignment based solely on local structure-motif similarity agnostic of long range rigid body atomic alignment.) Because of that same parsimony, it is well over ten times faster than DALI, CE and TM-align. It is often used in conjunction with these slower tools to pre-screen large data bases to extract the just the best E-value related structures for more exhaustive superposition or expensive calculations. 

It has been particularly successful at analyzing &quot;decoy&quot; structures from ab initio structure prediction. These decoys are notorious for getting local fragment motif structure correct, and forming some kernels of correct 3D tertiary structure but getting the full length tertiary structure wrong. In this twilight remote homology regime, Mammoth&#x27;s e-values for the CASP protein structure prediction evaluation have been shown to be significantly more correlated with human ranking than SSAP or DALI. Mammoths ability to extract the multi-criteria partial overlaps with proteins of known structure and rank these with proper E-values, combined with its speed facilitates scanning vast numbers of decoy models against the PDB data base for identifying the most likely correct decoys based on their remote homology to known proteins. 
===SSAP===
The SSAP (Sequential Structure Alignment Program) method uses double dynamic programming to produce a structural alignment based on atom-to-atom vectors in structure space. Instead of the alpha carbons typically used in structural alignment, SSAP constructs its vectors from the beta carbons for all residues except glycine, a method which thus takes into account the rotameric state of each residue as well as its location along the backbone. SSAP works by first constructing a series of inter-residue distance vectors between each residue and its nearest non-contiguous neighbors on each protein. A series of matrices are then constructed containing the vector differences between neighbors for each pair of residues for which vectors were constructed. Dynamic programming applied to each resulting matrix determines a series of optimal local alignments which are then summed into a &quot;summary&quot; matrix to which dynamic programming is applied again to determine the overall structural alignment.

SSAP originally produced only pairwise alignments but has since been extended to multiple alignments as well. It has been applied in an all-to-all fashion to produce a hierarchical fold classification scheme known as CATH (Class, Architecture, Topology, Homology), which has been used to construct the CATH Protein Structure Classification database.

==Recent developments==
Improvements in structural alignment methods constitute an active area of research, and new or modified methods are often proposed that are claimed to offer advantages over the older and more widely distributed techniques. A recent example, TM-align, uses a novel method for weighting its distance matrix, to which standard dynamic programming is then applied. The weighting is proposed to accelerate the convergence of dynamic programming and correct for effects arising from alignment lengths. In a benchmarking study, TM-align has been reported to improve in both speed and accuracy over DALI and CE.

Other promising methods of structural alignment are local structural alignment methods. These provide comparison of pre-selected parts of proteins (e.g. binding sites, user-defined structural motifs) against binding sites or whole-protein structural databases. The MultiBind and MAPPIS servers allow the identification of common spatial arrangements of physicochemical properties such as H-bond donor, acceptor, aliphatic, aromatic or hydrophobic in a set of user provided protein binding sites defined by interactions with small molecules (MultiBind) or in a set of user-provided protein–protein interfaces (MAPPIS). Others provide comparison of entire protein structures against a number of user submitted structures or against a large database of protein structures in reasonable time (ProBiS). Unlike global alignment approaches, local structural alignment approaches are suited to detection of locally conserved patterns of functional groups, which often appear in binding sites and have significant involvement in ligand binding. As an example, comparing G-Losa, a local structure alignment tool, with TM-align, a global structure alignment based method. While G-Losa predicts drug-like ligands’ positions in single-chain protein targets more precisely than TM-align, the overall success rate of TM-align is better.

However, as algorithmic improvements and computer performance have erased purely technical deficiencies in older approaches, it has become clear that there is no one universal criterion for the &#x27;optimal&#x27; structural alignment. TM-align, for instance, is particularly robust in quantifying comparisons between sets of proteins with great disparities in sequence lengths, but it only indirectly captures hydrogen bonding or secondary structure order conservation which might be better metrics for alignment of evolutionarily related proteins. Thus recent developments have focused on optimizing particular attributes such as speed, quantification of scores, correlation to alternative gold standards, or tolerance of imperfection in structural data or ab initio structural models. An alternative methodology that is gaining popularity is to use the &quot;consensus&quot; of various methods to ascertain proteins structural similarities.

==RNA structural alignment==
Structural alignment techniques have traditionally been applied exclusively to proteins, as the primary biological macromolecules that assume characteristic three-dimensional structures. However, large RNA molecules also form characteristic tertiary structures, which are mediated primarily by hydrogen bonds formed between base pairs as well as base stacking. Functionally similar noncoding RNA molecules can be especially difficult to extract from genomics data because structure is more strongly conserved than sequence in RNA as well as in proteins, and the more limited alphabet of RNA decreases the information content of any given nucleotide at any given position.

However, because of the increasing interest in RNA structures and because of the growth of the number of experimentally determined 3D RNA structures, few RNA structure similarity methods have been developed recently. One of those methods is, e.g., SETTER which decomposes each RNA structure into smaller parts called general secondary structure units (GSSUs). GSSUs are subsequently aligned and these partial alignments are merged into the final RNA structure alignment and scored. The method has been implemented into the SETTER webserver.

A recent method for pairwise structural alignment of RNA sequences with low sequence identity has been published and implemented in the program FOLDALIGN. However, this method is not truly analogous to protein structural alignment techniques because it computationally predicts the structures of the RNA input sequences rather than requiring experimentally determined structures as input. Although computational prediction of the protein folding process has not been particularly successful to date, RNA structures without pseudoknots can often be sensibly predicted using free energy-based scoring methods that account for base pairing and stacking.

==Software==

Choosing a software tool for structural alignment can be a challenge due to the large variety of available packages that differ significantly in methodology and reliability. A partial solution to this problem was presented in and made publicly accessible through the ProCKSI webserver. A more complete list of currently available and freely distributed structural alignment software can be found in structural alignment software.

Properties of some structural alignment servers and software packages are summarized and tested with examples at Structural Alignment Tools in Proteopedia.Org.

<text>Rudolf Ivanovich Abel () was the alias of William August Fisher (11 July 1903 – 15 November 1971), a Soviet intelligence officer, created to alert his Soviet KGB handlers when Fisher was arrested in the USA on charges of espionage by the FBI in 1957.

Fisher was born and grew up in Newcastle upon Tyne in the North East of England in the United Kingdom to Russian émigré parents. He moved to Russia in the 1920s, and served in the Soviet military before undertaking foreign service as a radio operator in Soviet intelligence in the late 1920s and early 1930s. He later served in an instructional role before taking part in intelligence operations against the Germans during World War II. After the war, he began working for the KGB, which sent him to the United States where he worked as part of a spy ring based in New York City.

In 1957, Fisher was convicted in US federal court on three counts of conspiracy as a Soviet spy for his involvement in what became known as the Hollow Nickel Case and sentenced to 30 years&#x27; imprisonment at Atlanta Federal Penitentiary in Georgia. He served just over four years of his sentence before he was exchanged for captured American U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers and Yale University doctoral student Frederic Pryor. Back in the Soviet Union, he lectured on his experiences. He died in 1971 at the age of 68. His real identity and country of birth were only revealed after his death.

== Early life ==
Fisher was born William August Fisher on 11 July 1903, in the Benwell area of Newcastle upon Tyne, the second son of Heinrich and Lyubov Fisher. Revolutionary activists of the Tsarist era, his father was of German origins and his mother was of Russian descent. Fisher&#x27;s father taught and agitated with Vladimir Lenin at Saint Petersburg Technological Institute.

In 1896, he was arrested for sedition and sentenced to three years internal exile. As Heinrich Fisher had served a sentence for offenses against the Russian Imperial Crown, he was forced to flee to the United Kingdom in 1901, the alternative being deportation to Germany or imprisonment in Russia for avoidance of military service. While living in the United Kingdom, Fisher&#x27;s father, a keen Bolshevik, took part in gunrunning, shipping arms from northeast England to Russia&#x27;s Baltic coast.

Fisher and his brother, Henry, won scholarships to Whitley Bay High School and Monkseaton High School. Though Fisher was not as hard-working as Henry, he showed aptitude for science, mathematics, languages, art and music, inherited in part from his father&#x27;s abilities. Encouraging their son&#x27;s love of music, Fisher&#x27;s parents gave him piano lessons; he also learned to play the guitar. It was during this period that Fisher developed an interest in amateur radio, constructing rudimentary spark transmitters and receivers.

Fisher became an apprentice draughtsman at Swan Hunter, Wallsend, and attended evening classes at Rutherford College before being accepted into London University in 1920. Though Fisher qualified for university, the costs prohibited him from attending. In 1921, following the Russian Revolution, the Fisher family left Newcastle upon Tyne to return to Moscow.

== Early career ==
Fluent in English, Russian, German, Polish and Yiddish, Fisher worked for the Comintern as a translator following his family&#x27;s return to the Soviet Union. Trained as a radio operator, he served in a Red Army radio battalion in 1925 and 1926. He then worked briefly in the radio research institute before being recruited by the OGPU, a predecessor of the KGB, in May 1927. That year he married Elena Lebedeva, a harp student at Moscow Conservatory. They had one child together, a daughter named Evelyn who was born on 8 October 1929. During his interview with the OGPU, it was determined he should adopt a Russian-sounding name and William August Fisher became Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher. Following his recruitment, he worked for the OGPU as a radio operator in Norway, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and France. He returned to the Soviet Union in 1936, as head of a school that trained radio operators destined for duty in illegal residences. One of the students was the Canadian-born Russian spy Kitty Harris, who was later more widely known as &quot;The Spy with Seventeen Names&quot;.

Despite his foreign birth and the accusation that his brother-in-law was a Trotskyist, Fisher narrowly escaped the Great Purge. However, in 1938 he was dismissed from the NKVD, the moniker the OGPU had adopted in 1934. During World War II, he again trained radio operators for the clandestine work behind German lines. Having been adopted as a protégé by Pavel Sudoplatov, he took part in Operation Scherhorn (, ) in August 1944. Sudoplatov later described this operation as &quot;the most successful radio deception game of the war&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sudoplatov/Schecter 1994–1995, p. 168&quot;&gt;Sudoplatov/Schecter (1994–1995), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher&#x27;s role in this operation was rewarded with what his superiors regarded as one of the most prestigious postings in Soviet foreign intelligence, the United States.

== KGB service ==
After rejoining the KGB in 1946, Fisher was trained as a spy for entry into the United States. In October 1948, using a Soviet passport, he travelled from Leningradsky Station to Warsaw. In Warsaw, he discarded his Soviet passport and using a U.S. passport traveled from Czechoslovakia and Switzerland to Paris. His new passport bore the name Andrew Kayotis, the first of Fisher&#x27;s false identities. The real Andrew Kayotis was Lithuanian born and had become an American citizen after migrating to the United States. Kayotis had applied for and received a visa to visit the Soviet Union. However, the Soviets retained his passport, which Fisher eventually used. Kayotis had been in poor health and died while visiting relatives in Vilnius, Lithuania. Fisher, as Kayotis, then travelled aboard the from Le Havre, France, to North America, disembarking at Quebec. Still using Kayotis&#x27; passport, he went to Montreal and crossed into the United States on 17 November.

On 26 November, Fisher met with Soviet &quot;illegal&quot; Iosif Grigulevich (codenamed &quot;MAKS&quot; or &quot;ARTUR&quot;). Grigulevich gave Fisher a genuine birth certificate, a forged draft card and a forged tax certificate, all under the name of Emil Robert Goldfus, along with $1,000. After handing back Kayotis&#x27;s passport and documents, Fisher assumed the name Goldfus. His codename was &quot;MARK&quot;. The real Goldfus had died at only 14 months, having been born on August 2, 1902, in New York. Goldfus&#x27;s birth certificate was obtained by the NKVD at the end of the Spanish Civil War, when the Centre would collect identity documents from International Brigades members for use in espionage operations.

In July 1949, Fisher met with a &quot;legal&quot; KGB resident from the Soviet consulate general, who provided him with money. Shortly afterwards Fisher was ordered to reactivate the &quot;Volunteer&quot; network to smuggle atomic secrets to Russia. Members of the network had stopped cooperating after postwar security was tightened at Los Alamos. Lona Cohen (codenamed &quot;LESLE&quot;) and her husband Morris Cohen (codenamed &quot;LUIS&quot; and &quot;VOLUNTEER&quot;) had run the Volunteer network and were seasoned couriers. Theodore &quot;Ted&quot; Hall (codenamed &quot;MLAD&quot;), a physicist, was the most important agent in the network in 1945, passing atomic secrets from Los Alamos. The Volunteer network grew to include &quot;Aden&quot; and &quot;Serb&quot;, nuclear physicists contacted by Hall, and &quot;Silver&quot;. Fisher spent most of his first year organizing his network. While it is not known for certain where Fisher went or what he did, it is believed he travelled to Santa Fe, New Mexico, the collection point for stolen diagrams from the Manhattan Project. Kitty Harris, a former pupil of Fisher&#x27;s, had spent a year in Santa Fe during the war, where she passed secrets from physicists to couriers. During this period, Fisher received the Order of the Red Banner, an important Soviet decoration normally reserved for military personnel.

In 1950, Fisher&#x27;s illegal residency was endangered by the arrest of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, for whom Lona Cohen had been a courier. The Cohens were quickly spirited to Mexico before moving on to Moscow. They were to resurface in the United Kingdom using the identities of Peter and Helen Kroger. Fisher was relieved when the Rosenbergs did not disclose any information about him to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), but the arrests heralded a bleak outlook for his new spy network. However, on 21 October 1952, as instructed by Moscow, Reino Häyhänen left a thumbtack on a signpost in New York&#x27;s Central Park. The thumbtack signaled to Fisher that Häyhänen, his new assistant, had arrived. Codenamed &quot;VIK&quot;, Häyhänen arrived in New York on the RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, under the alias Eugene Nikolai Maki. The real Maki had been born in the United States to a Finnish-American father and a New York mother in 1919. In 1927, the family migrated to Estonia. In 1948, the KGB had called Häyhänen to Moscow where they issued him a new assignment. In 1949, Häyhänen freely obtained Maki&#x27;s birth certificate. He had then spent three years in Finland taking over Maki&#x27;s identity.

After arriving in New York, Häyhänen spent the next two years establishing his identity. During that time he received money from his superiors left in dead-letter boxes in the Bronx and Manhattan. It is known he occasionally drew attention to himself by indulging in heavy drinking sessions and heated arguments with his Finnish wife Hannah. For six months Häyhänen checked the thumbtack and no one had made contact. He also checked a dead-drop location he had memorized. There he found a hollowed-out nickel. However, prior to opening the coin Häyhänen had misplaced it, either buying a newspaper with it or using it as a subway token. For the next seven months the hollow nickel travelled around the New York City economy, unopened. The trail of the hollow nickel ended when a thirteen-year-old newsboy was collecting for his weekly deliveries. The newsboy accidentally dropped the nickel and it broke in half, revealing a microphotograph containing a series of numbers. The newsboy handed the nickel to a New York detective, who in turn forwarded it to the FBI, whose investigation became known as the Hollow Nickel Case. From 1953 to 1957, though every effort was made to decipher the microphotograph, the FBI was unable to solve the mystery.

Late in 1953, Fisher moved to Brooklyn and rented a room in a boarding house on Hicks Street. He also rented a fifth-floor studio at the Ovington Studios Building on Fulton Street. Since he was posing as an artist and photographer, nobody questioned his irregular working hours and frequent disappearances. Over time his artistic technique improved and he became a competent painter, though he disliked abstract painting, preferring more conventional styles. He mingled with New York artists, who were surprised by his admiration for the Russian painter Isaak Levitan, although Fisher was careful not to discuss Stalinist &quot;socialist realism&quot;. The only visitors to Fisher&#x27;s studio were artist friends with whom he felt safe from suspicion. In particular, he became a friend of Burton Silverman. Fisher sometimes related made-up stories of previous lives, as a Boston accountant and a lumberjack in the Pacific Northwest.

In 1954, Häyhänen began working as Fisher&#x27;s assistant. He was to deliver a report from a Soviet agent at the United Nations secretariat, to a dead-letter box for collection. However the report never arrived. Fisher was disturbed by Häyhänen&#x27;s lack of work ethics and his obsession with alcohol. In the spring of 1955, Fisher and Häyhänen visited Bear Mountain Park, and buried $5,000 (), destined for the wife of the Soviet spy Morton Sobell, who in 1951 was sentenced to thirty years in jail.

In 1955, Fisher, exhausted by the constant pressure, returned to Moscow for six months of rest and recuperation, leaving Häyhänen in charge. While in Moscow, Fisher informed his superiors of his dissatisfaction with Häyhänen. Upon his return to New York in 1956, he found that his carefully constructed network had been left to disintegrate in his absence. Fisher checked his drop points only to find messages several months old, while Häyhänen&#x27;s radio transmissions had routinely been sent from the same location using incorrect radio frequencies. The money Häyhänen received from the KGB to support the network was instead spent on alcohol and prostitutes.

By early 1957, Fisher had lost patience with Häyhänen and demanded that Moscow recall his deputy. In January 1957, Häyhänen received a message from Moscow promoting him to Lieutenant Colonel and granting him leave in the Soviet Union. Upon hearing he was due to return to Moscow, Häyhänen was fearful that he would be severely disciplined or even executed. Häyhänen fabricated stories to justify his delay, claiming to Fisher that the FBI had taken him off the RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. Fisher, unsuspecting, advised Häyhänen to leave the U.S. immediately to avoid FBI surveillance and handed him $200 for travel expenses. Prior to his departure, Häyhänen returned to Bear Mountain Park and retrieved the buried $5,000 for his own use. Häyhänen arrived in Paris on May Day, having sailed from the U.S. aboard &quot;La Liberté&quot;. Making contact with the KGB residency he received another $200 for his journey to Moscow. Four days later, instead of continuing his journey to the Soviet Union he entered the American embassy in Paris, announcing that he was a KGB officer and asking for asylum.

When Häyhänen announced himself at the embassy on 4 May, he appeared drunk. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officials at the Paris embassy did not find Häyhänen&#x27;s story credible. They were not convinced he might actually be a Russian spy until he produced a hollow Finnish 5-mark coin. Upon opening the coin a square of microfilm was revealed. On 11 May, the CIA returned him to the United States and handed him over to the FBI. As a member of a Soviet spy ring operating on American soil, Häyhänen came under the FBI&#x27;s jurisdiction and they began verifying his story.

Upon his arrival in the United States, Häyhänen was interrogated by the FBI and proved very cooperative. He admitted his first Soviet contact in New York had been &quot;MIKHAIL&quot; and upon being shown a series of photographs of Soviet officials identified &quot;MIKHAIL&quot; as Mikhail Svirin. Svirin, however, had returned to Moscow two years previously. The FBI then turned its attention to Svirin&#x27;s replacement. Häyhänen was able only to provide Fisher&#x27;s codename, &quot;MARK&quot;, and a description. He was, however, able to tell the FBI about Fisher&#x27;s studio and its location. Häyhänen was also able to solve the mystery of the &quot;hollow nickel,&quot; which the FBI had been unable to decipher for four years.

The KGB did not discover Häyhänen&#x27;s defection until August, although it is more than likely they notified Fisher earlier when Häyhänen failed to arrive in Moscow. As a precaution, Fisher was ordered to leave the United States. Escape was complicated because, if &quot;MARK&quot; had been compromised by Häyhänen, Fisher&#x27;s other identities could have been compromised as well. Fisher could not leave the country as Martin Collins, Emil Goldfus, or even the long-forgotten Andrew Kayotis. The KGB Center, with the help of KGB&#x27;s Ottawa resident, set about procuring two new passports for Fisher in the names of Robert Callan and Vasili Dzogol, but this process would take time. The Canadian Communist Party succeeded in obtaining a new passport for Fisher in the name of Robert Callan. Fisher, however, was arrested before he could adopt his new identity and leave the United States.

== Capture ==
In April 1957, Fisher told his artist friends he was going south on a seven-week holiday. Less than three weeks later, acting on Häyhänen&#x27;s information, surveillance was established near Fisher&#x27;s photo studio. On 28 May 1957, in a small park opposite Fulton Street, FBI agents spotted a man acting nervously. From time to time the man got up, walked around, and eventually left. FBI agents were convinced he fit the description of &quot;MARK&quot;. The surveillance continued on &quot;MARK&quot; and, on the night of 13 June, a light was seen to go on in Fisher&#x27;s studio at 10:00 pm.

On 15 June 1957, Häyhänen was shown a photograph of Fisher taken by the FBI with a hidden camera. Häyhänen confirmed that it was &quot;MARK&quot; in the photograph. Once the FBI had a positive identification, they stepped up surveillance, following Fisher from his studio to the Hotel Latham. Fisher was aware of the &quot;tail&quot; but, as he had no passport to leave the country, he devised a plan to be used upon his capture. Fisher decided that he would not turn traitor as Häyhänen had done because he still trusted the KGB and he knew that if he cooperated with the FBI, he would not see his wife and daughter again.

At 7:00 am on 21 June 1957, Fisher answered a knock on the door to his room, Room 839. Upon opening the door, he was confronted by FBI agents who addressed him as &quot;colonel&quot; and stated that they had &quot;information concerning [his] involvement in espionage.&quot; Fisher knew that the FBI&#x27;s use of his rank could have only come from Häyhänen. Fisher said nothing to the FBI and, after spending twenty-three minutes staring at Fisher, the FBI agents called in the waiting Immigration and Naturalization Service officers who arrested Fisher and detained him under section 242 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

Fisher was then flown to the Federal Alien Detention Facility in McAllen, Texas, and held there for six weeks. During this period Fisher stated that his &quot;real&quot; name was Rudolf Ivanovich Abel and that he was a Soviet citizen, although he refused to discuss his intelligence activities. The name &quot;Rudolf Ivanovich Abel&quot; was that of a deceased friend and a KGB colonel; Fisher knew as soon as The Centre saw the name Abel on the front pages of American newspapers they would realize he had been captured.

During Fisher&#x27;s detainment the FBI had been searching his hotel room and photo studio, where they discovered espionage equipment including shortwave radios, cipher pads, cameras and film for producing microdots, a hollow shaving brush, and numerous &quot;trick&quot; containers including hollowed-out bolts. In Fisher&#x27;s New York hotel room the FBI found $4,000, a hollow ebony block containing a 250-page Russian codebook, a hollow pencil containing encrypted messages on microfilm and a key to a safe-deposit box containing another $15,000 in cash. Also discovered were photographs of the Cohens and recognition phrases to establish contact between agents who had never met before.

As Fisher was no longer considered an alleged illegal alien, but rather an alleged spy, he was flown from Texas to New York on 7 August 1957, to answer the indictment. Fisher was subsequently indicted to stand trial as a Soviet spy. The Brooklyn Bar Association approached several prominent trial lawyers with political ambitions, all of whom declined the case. They then contacted James B. Donovan. Because he had served as a wartime counsel in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and had years of courtroom experience, the Bar Association believed Donovan was uniquely qualified to act as Fisher&#x27;s defense lawyer. At Donovan&#x27;s initial meeting with Fisher, the latter accepted Donovan as his defense counsel. Donovan subsequently brought in attorney Thomas M. Debevoise to assist him; Fisher was tried in Federal Court at New York City during October 1957, on three counts:

* Conspiracy to transmit defense information to the Soviet Union – 30 years imprisonment;
* Conspiracy to obtain defense information – 10 years imprisonment; and
* Conspiracy to act in the United States as an agent of a foreign government without notification to the Secretary of State – 5 years imprisonment.

Häyhänen, Fisher&#x27;s former assistant, testified against him at the trial. The prosecution failed to find any other alleged members of Fisher&#x27;s spy network, if there were any. The jury retired for three and a half hours and returned on the afternoon of October 25, 1957, finding Fisher guilty on all three counts. On 15 November 1957, Judge Mortimer W. Byers imposed on Fisher a total sentence of thirty years and fines of $3,000. In &quot;Abel v. United States&quot;, the United States Supreme Court upheld his conviction by a vote of 5–4.

Fisher, or &quot;Rudolf Ivanovich Abel&quot;, was to serve his sentence (as prisoner 80016–A) at Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, Georgia. He occupied himself with painting, learning silk-screening, playing chess, and writing logarithmic tables for the sheer enjoyment of it. He became friends with two other convicted Soviet spies. One of these was Morton Sobell, whose wife had failed to receive the $5,000 embezzled by Häyhänen. The other prisoner was Kurt Ponger, an Austrian who had been sentenced for conspiracy to commit espionage.

== Release and later life ==
Fisher served just over four years of his sentence. On 10 February 1962, he was exchanged for the shot-down American U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers. The exchange took place on the Glienicke Bridge that linked West Berlin with Potsdam, which became famous during the Cold War as the &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot;. At precisely the same time, at Checkpoint Charlie, Frederic Pryor was released by the East German Stasi into the waiting arms of his father. A few days later Fisher, reunited with his wife Elena and daughter Evelyn, flew home.

For the sake of its own reputation it suited the KGB to reveal &quot;Abel&#x27;s&quot; nine years of being an undetected agent in the United States as a triumph by a dedicated NKVD member. The idea that the name of the master spy was Rudolf Abel replaced the reality of Fisher. During his eight years as an illegal resident, Fisher was one of the most successful KGB agents in the United States. Even though he appears not to have recruited a single agent, he identified potential spies and managed and expanded the existing network so well that CIA director Allen Dulles said that he wished that he had even &quot;one&quot; agent as good as Abel operating within the USSR.

After his return to Moscow, Fisher was employed by the Illegals Directorate of the KGB&#x27;s First Chief Directorate, giving speeches and lecturing school children on intelligence work, but became increasingly disillusioned. He made a notable appearance in the foreword to the Soviet spy film &quot;Dead Season&quot; and also worked as a consultant on the film.

Fisher, who was a heavy smoker, died of lung cancer on 15 November 1971. His ashes were interred at the Donskoye Cemetery under his real name, next to Konon Molody who had died the previous year. A few Western correspondents were invited there to view for themselves the true identity of the spy who never &quot;broke&quot;.

== Legacy ==
* His fate inspired Vadim Kozhevnikov to write the adventure novel &quot;Shield and Sword&quot;. Although the name of the main character is Alexander Belov and is associated with Abel&#x27;s name, the plot of the book is significantly different from the real fate of William August Fisher.
* For the first time Abel showed himself to the general public in 1968, when he addressed his compatriots with an introductory speech to the film &quot;Dead Season&quot; (as an official consultant to the picture).
* In 2008, Yuri Linkevich shot the documentary &quot;Unknown Abel&quot;.
* In 2009, the Channel One Russia created an artistic two-part biographical film &quot;The US Government against Rudolf Abel&quot; (starring Yury Belyayev).
* In Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 2015 film &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot;, Fisher/Abel is portrayed by Mark Rylance. For his performance, Rylance won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.
* On 18 December 2015, on the eve of the Day of State Security Officers (a professional holiday), a grand opening ceremony of the memorial plaque to William Genrikhovich Fisher took place in Samara. The plaque, authored by Samara architect Dmitry Khramov, appeared on 8, Molodogvardeyskaya Street. It is believed that exactly here the family of the intelligence officer lived during the years of World War II. William Genrikhovich himself at that time taught radio business at a secret intelligence school, and later led counterintelligence radio operation against German intelligence from Kuibyshev.
* In 1990 the USSR released a stamp depicting Rudolf Abel as part of series: &quot;Intelligence Agents&quot;.

<text>&quot;Blind Alley&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov. It was first published in the March 1945 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, and later included in the collection &quot;The Early Asimov&quot; (1972).

Although the story postulates a race of intelligent non-humans, it is set in the &quot;Foundation&quot; universe, during the era of Trantor&#x27;s Galactic Empire.

==Publication history==
&quot;Blind Alley&quot; was the only story from mid-1943 to mid-1945 that was not part of Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; or &quot;Robot&quot; series. Written in September and October 1944, it was accepted by John W. Campbell in October and published in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; in March 1945. It was anthologised by Groff Conklin in &quot;The Best of Science Fiction&quot;, the first of Asimov&#x27;s stories to have been reprinted. The $42.50 from the anthology caused him to realize that it was possible to earn more money from a story than the initial publication.

Conklin included the story in a number of anthologies: the 1963 edition of &quot;The Best of Science Fiction&quot;, &quot;Great Stories of Space Travel&quot; also published that year and &quot;The Golden Age of Science Fiction&quot; in 1980. It also appeared in &quot;Isaac Asimov Presents the Great SF Stories 7&quot; edited by Asimov and Martin H. Greenberg in 1982, and &quot;Intergalactic Empires&quot; edited by Asimov, Greenberg and Charles G. Waugh in 1983. Asimov included it in his own &quot;The Early Asimov&quot; in 1972, &quot;The Asimov Chronicles&quot; in 1989, and in volume 2 of &quot;The Complete Stories&quot; in 1992.

==Plot summary==
The few remaining members of the only intelligent non-human alien race the Galactic Empire has discovered have been removed from their dying planet and transferred to the much more pleasant Cepheus-18 (hence their name, &quot;Cepheids&quot;). The planet is a combination of zoo, laboratory, and reservation for the creatures. The scientists that study the Cepheids differ on whether to treat them as sentient beings or as animals, but agree that the aliens are in danger of extinction as they have ceased to reproduce. While the administrator already suspects that this is due to a certain ennui, the Cepheids&#x27; leader later admits personally that while their race would likely have soon died out on its dangerous home world as their science only covered their biological needs; they have nothing to live for in a galaxy completely ruled by humans who provide for all their physical needs, and they are prohibited from leaving the Empire.

The civilian supervisor, a career administrator, attempts to help the creatures using his thorough knowledge of the Imperial bureaucracy. By carefully orchestrating a leak of a report he himself arranged, he causes the bureaucracy to make the reproduction problem a priority. Then, he arranges for the Cepheids to receive pilot training under the guise of providing them with a challenge. And finally, by using a crude form of telepathy during an interview with their leader, he gets the leader to express interest in a bulky object, so that he can manipulate the bureaucracy into arranging to deliver a large quantity of these to the Cepheids with a fleet of hundreds of spaceships.

His plan works; the Cepheids commandeer the ships, catching the humans off-guard without any nearby ships with which to mount a pursuit. It is hinted that they have left for the Magellanic Clouds to find a new world of their own. The supervisor has protected himself from any blame for the escape by his ingenious bureaucratic maneuvers, and is placed on leave pending reassignment.

==Historical context==
The author utilizes a turgid bureaucratic style of phraseology for the many memoranda that are a part of the story; this was based on that in use by the U.S. Navy, Asimov&#x27;s employers at the Philadelphia Navy Yard.

The aliens&#x27; predicament in a human-dominated galaxy is similar to the eventual fate of humans in the alternative futures of &quot;The End of Eternity&quot;. It does however have a very different ending — the Cepheids steal the spacecraft and head for an independent life in the Magellanic Clouds.

The &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot; character Golan Trevize says that no human ship has ever penetrated the Magellanic Clouds, nor the Andromeda Galaxy or other more distant galaxies. It is not known whether Asimov intended to make a link between those novels and this short story.

==The Second Foundation trilogy==
In the &#x27;Second Foundation&#x27; trilogy, a series of books authorized by the estate of Asimov, a race of aliens within the Foundation Universe is mentioned who appear to be in circumstances similar to the Cepheids. Although they are not mentioned by name, a major character in this story is. A subplot in &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Triumph&quot; investigates the problem raised in this story.

<text>Mitchell Herbert Ellis (August 4, 1921 – March 28, 2010) was an American jazz guitarist. During the 1950s, he was in a trio with pianist Oscar Peterson.

==Biography==
Born in Farmersville, Texas, Ellis grew up on a farm. He was first exposed to guitar music when he heard the Light Crust Doughboys on the radio. At the age of three, Ellis was playing harmonica, and banjo by six. Although his brother owned a guitar, he tuned it wrong. Ellis wanted to play better than his brother, so he bought a book to learn how to tune guitar properly, and his interest in guitar grew from there. He was ultimately inspired to pick up jazz guitar after hearing George Barnes on a radio program. 

Ellis was proficient on the instrument by the time he entered North Texas State University. He majored in music, but because the university did not have a guitar program, he studied the bass. He dropped out of college and toured for six months with a band from the University of Kansas. From 1943–45 he joined Glen Gray and the Casa Loma Orchestra. After Gray&#x27;s band, Ellis joined the Jimmy Dorsey band where he played some of his first recorded solos.

Ellis remained with Dorsey through 1947, traveling and recording extensively, and playing in dance halls and movie palaces. Lou Carter told journalist Robert Dupuis in a 1996 interview, &quot;The Dorsey band had a six-week hole in the schedule. The three of us had played together some with the big band. John Frigo, who had already left the band, knew the owner of the Peter Stuyvesant Hotel in Buffalo. We went in there and stayed six months. And that&#x27;s how the group the Soft Winds were born&quot;. Together with Frigo and Lou Carter, Ellis wrote the classic jazz standards &quot;Detour Ahead&quot; and &quot;I Told Ya I Love Ya, Now Get Out&quot;.

The Soft Winds group was fashioned after the Nat King Cole Trio. They stayed together until 1952. Ellis then joined the Oscar Peterson Trio (replacing Barney Kessel) in 1953, forming what Scott Yanow would later on refer to as &quot;one of the most memorable of all the piano, guitar, and bass trios in jazz history&quot;.

Ellis became prominent after performing with the Oscar Peterson Trio from 1953 to 1958, along with pianist Peterson and bassist Ray Brown. He was a somewhat controversial member of the trio, because he was the only white person in the group in a time when racism was still very much widespread.
In addition to their live and recorded work as the Oscar Peterson Trio, this unit usually with the addition of a drummer, served as the virtual &quot;house rhythm section&quot; for Norman Granz&#x27;s Verve Records, supporting the likes of tenormen Ben Webster and Stan Getz, as well as trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie, Roy Eldridge, and Sweets Edison and other jazz stalwarts. Ellis was part of the rhythm section but did not solo on every track. With drummer Buddy Rich, they were also the backing band for popular &quot;comeback&quot; albums by the duet of Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong.

The trio were one of the mainstays of Granz&#x27;s Jazz at the Philharmonic concerts as they swept the jazz world, almost constantly touring the United States and Europe. Ellis left the Peterson Trio in November 1958, to be replaced not by a guitarist, but by drummer Ed Thigpen. The years of 1957 through 1960 found Ellis touring with Ella Fitzgerald. In addition, Ellis was a mainstay in Hollywood recording studios playing on various types of sessions. Eventually, he left studio work to concentrate on his jazz career, both onstage and on records.

The three provided a stirring rendition of &quot;Tenderly&quot; as a jazz improvisational backdrop to John Hubley&#x27;s 1958 cartoon &quot;The Tender Game&quot;.

With fellow jazz guitarists Barney Kessel, Charlie Byrd and later, Tal Farlow, he created another ensemble, the Great Guitars.

Herb Ellis was also featured on an episode of &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; accompanying Fred Sanford&#x27;s singing.

Ellis gave cartoonist and &quot;The Far Side&quot; creator Gary Larson guitar lessons, in exchange for the cover illustration for the album, &quot;Doggin&#x27; Around&quot; (Concord, 1988) by Ellis and bassist Red Mitchell.

In 1994, he joined the Arkansas Jazz Hall of Fame. On November 15, 1997, he received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of North Texas College of Music.

Ellis died of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at his Los Angeles home on the morning of March 28, 2010, at the age of 88.

<text>Isin (, modern Arabic: Ishan al-Bahriyat) is an archaeological site in Al-Qādisiyyah Governorate, Iraq which was the location of the Ancient Near East city of Isin, occupied from the late 4th millennium Uruk period up until at least the late 1st millennium BC Neo-Babylonian period. It lies about southeast of the modern city of Al Diwaniyah.

The tutelary deity of Isin, dating back to at least the Early Dynastic period, was the healing goddess Gula with a major temple (, E-gal-ma) sited there as well as smaller installations for the related gods of Ninisina and Sud.

==Archaeology==

Isin is located approximately south of the ancient city of Nippur. The site covers an area of about 150 hectares with a maximum height of about 10 meters.

By 1922 the site had been suggested as that of Isin. Ishan al-Bahriyat was visited by Stephen Herbert Langdon for a day to conduct a sounding, while he was excavating at Kish in 1924. He found inscribed bricks of Ishme-Dagan and Enlil-bani. Two years later Raymond P. Dougherty, on behalf of the American Schools of Oriental Research, conducted a two-day survey of the site finding inscribed bricks of Bur-Sin and Neo-Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar II.
Modern archaeological work at Isin was accomplished in 11 seasons between 1973 and 1989 by a team of German archaeologists led by Barthel Hrouda on behalf of the Munich Institute for Near Eastern Archaeology. Hundreds of cuneiform tablets from the Old Babylonian period, in buildings abandoned after being destroyed by fire, were recovered. However, as was the case at many sites in Iraq, research was interrupted by the Gulf War (1990–1991) and the Iraq War (2003 to 2011). Since the end of excavations, extensive looting is reported to have resumed at the site. Even when the German team began their work, the site had already been heavily looted. A significant find, in the Ninurta shrine of the Gula temple, was an alabaster mace head of the Akkadian Empire ruler Manishtushu inscribed &quot;Man-istusu, king of the world, dedicated (this mace) to the goddess Ninisina&quot;. An inscription of Takil-ilissu, ruler of Malgium was also found. Early find included a Jemdet Nasr stamp seal and a small stone lion figurine of the Uruk period.

The primary focus of the excavations was the four meter wide wall enclosed Gula temple complex. The complex showed construction through at least the Isin I, Kassite, and Neo-Babylonian periods with 3rd millennium BC finds suggested its earlier existence. Finds included 30 dog burials, copper pendants inscribed with dog images, and clay dog figurines, one with a prayer to Gula. An inscribed brick of Adad-apla-iddina, 8th ruler of the 2nd dynasty of Isin, dedicated to the healing goddess Nin-ezena was also found. On another section of the main mound 3rd millennium BC buildings provided &quot;gold jewellery, bronze weapons, cylinder seals, and a few cuneiform tablets of which two date back to the Early Dynastic period&quot;, a clay nail of Isme-Dagan referring to construction of the bad-gal &quot;Great Wall&quot; city wall of Isin and an inscribed brick of Ur-du-kuga. In the Kassite layer an Early Dynastic III statue, 16.5 cm in height, of a kneeling man wearing only a triple belt. Just to the south of the temple complex two Early Dynastic I period buildings were found.

==History==

The site of Isin was occupied at least as early as the Ubaid period based on pottery shards. Significant occupation began in the Early Dynastic period in early to middle 3rd millennium BC. Isin is known to have been occupied during the Akkadian Empire. An intensive building program began at Isin during the Ur III empire in the late 3rd millennium BC. WIth the fall of Ur, an Amorite dynasty took power in the city, during the Isin-Larsa period. The city then fell to Babylon and suffered a period of abandonment. Activity resumed under the Kassites, followed by a period of local control. Isin was occupied to various degrees until the Neo-Babylonian period.

With the final decline of the Ur III empire at the end of the third millennium BC, a power vacuum was left that other city-states scrambled to fill. Ishbi-Erra, said to be an Amorite, from Mari, and an Ur III official under its final ruler Ibbi-Sin, gained rulership of Isin and began the First Dynasty of Isin. The Elamites had attacked Isin and Ur, capturing Ur. One of Ishbi-Erra&#x27;s acts was to expel the Elamites from Ur and the region, his year name being &quot;Year (Iszbi-Irra the king) brought out of Ur, with his strong weapon, the Elamite who was dwelling in its midst&quot;. Although the Sumerian King List gives a 33-year reign for Ishbi-Erra only one royal inscription has been found.
The Isin I dynasty lasted over two centuries. Its most powerful period was early on. With the rise of Larsa and a number of smaller Amorite city-states, the influence of Isin slowly declined. A notable ruler was Ishme-Dagan for whom a number of hymns were written, in a style thought to be imitative of Shulgi, the ruler of Ur III.

The exact events surrounding Isin&#x27;s disintegration as a kingdom are mostly unknown, but some evidence can be pieced together. Documents indicate that access to water sources presented a huge problem for Isin. Isin also endured an internal coup of a sort when Gungunum the royally appointed governor of Larsa and Lagash province, seized the city of Ur. Ur had been the main center of the Gulf trade; thus this move economically devastated Isin. Additionally, Gungunum&#x27;s two successors Abisare and Sumuel ( and 1894 BC) both sought to cut Isin off from its canals by rerouting them into Larsa. At some point, Nippur was also lost. Isin would never recover. Around 1860 BC, an outsider named Enlil-bani seized the throne of Isin, ending the hereditary dynasty established by Ishbi-Erra over 150 years earlier.
Although politically and economically weak, Isin maintained its independence from Larsa for at least another forty years, ultimately succumbing to Larsa&#x27;s ruler Rim-Sin I.

After the First Dynasty of Babylon rose to power in the early 2nd millennium and captured Larsa, much significant construction occurred at Isin. This ended with a destruction dated to around the 27th year of the reign of Samsu-iluna, son of Hammurabi, based on tablets found there.

Later, the Kassites who took over in Babylon after its sack in 1531 BC, resumed building at Isin. Activity was primarily at the Gula temple and it appears that in that period Isin was only a cult center. The final significant stage of activity occurred during the Second Dynasty of Isin at the end of the 2nd millennium, most notably by king Adad-apla-iddina. Isin remained occupied at least as late as the second decade of the reign of the Persian ruler Darius I (c 507 BC), then in the control of the region.

Of the at least 256 ruler year names about 75% have been found. Most have the standard format, aside from Bur-Sin who numbered his years. These year names combined with new tablet joins show that there were two additional rulers, Sumu-abum and Ikūn-pī-Išta, slotting in between Erra-imittī and Enlil-bān. The reign of Sumu-abum lasted less than a year.
==Culture and literature==

The city lay on the Isinnitum Canal, part of a set of waterways that connected the cities of Mesopotamia. The patron deity of Isin was Nintinuga (Gula) goddess of healing, and a temple to her was built there. The Isin king Enlil-bani reported building a temple to Gula named E-ni-dub-bi, a temple for Sud named E-dim-gal-an-na, a temple E-ur-gi-ra to Ninisina, as well as a temple for the god Ninbgal.

Ishbi-Erra continued many of the cultic practices that had flourished in the preceding Ur III period. He continued acting out the sacred marriage ritual each year. During this ritual, the king played the part of the mortal Dumuzi, and he had sex with a priestess who represented the goddess of love and war, Inanna (also known as Ishtar). This was thought to strengthen the king&#x27;s relationship to the gods, which would then bring stability and prosperity on the entire country.

The Isin kings continued also the practice of appointing their daughters official priestesses of the moon god of Ur.

The literature of the period also continued in the line of the Ur III traditions when the Isin dynasty was first begun. For example, the royal hymn, a genre started in the preceding millennium, was continued. Many royal hymns written for the Isin rulers mirrored the themes, structure, and language of the Ur ones. Sometimes the hymns were written in the first person of a king&#x27;s voice; other times, they were pleas of ordinary citizens meant for the ears of a king (sometimes an already dead one).

It was during this period that the Sumerian King List attained its final form, though it used many much earlier sources. The very compilation of the List seems to lead up to the Isin Dynasty itself, which would give it much legitimacy in the minds of the people because the dynasty would then be linked to earlier (albeit sometimes legendary) kings.
==List of rulers==
The &quot;Sumerian King List (SKL)&quot; gives a list of the rulers of only one dynasty of Isin. The first Sealand, Kassite, and second Isin dynasties are known from the &quot;Babylonian King List (BKL)&quot;. The following list should not be considered complete:

<doc id="474929" wikidata="Q6980102" url="?curid=474929" title="Native schools">
<text>Native schools or Māori schools in New Zealand were established to provide education for Māori children. The first schools for Māori were established by the Anglican Church Missionary Society (CMS) in the Bay of Islands starting in 1816. Catholic priests and brothers established schools for Māori throughout the country, including Hato Paora College (Feilding) and Hato Petera College (Auckland). St Joseph&#x27;s Māori Girls&#x27; College (Taradale) was founded by the Sisters of Our Lady of the Missions.

The Native Schools Act 1867 established a national system of village primary schools under the control of the Native Department. As part of the Government&#x27;s policy to assimilate Māori into Pākehā society, instruction was to be conducted entirely in English where practical. Under the Act, it was the responsibility of Māori communities to request a school for their children, form a school committee, supply land for the school and, until 1871, pay for half of the building costs and a quarter of the teacher&#x27;s salary. Many communities were keen for their children to learn English as a second language and by 1879 there were 57 native schools. In 1880 the first inspector of native schools was appointed and a Native Schools Code was issued that prescribed a curriculum, established qualifications for teachers, and standardised operation for the Māori schools.

==Church and missionary schools==
The CMS founded its first mission at Rangihoua in the Bay of Islands in 1814 and over the next decade established schools in the Bay of Islands, the first being run by Thomas Kendall from 1816 to 1818. Education of Māori children and adults advanced with the arrival of Henry Williams and his wife Marianne in 1823. In 1826 Henry&#x27;s brother William Williams and his wife Jane joined the CMS mission and settled at Paihia in the Bay of Islands, where schools were established. Richard Taylor was appointed as head of the CMS school at Te Waimate mission in 1839 and remained there until 1842.

Schools for Māori children and adults were established in locations where the CMS established mission stations. For example, William Williams and his family arrived at Tūranga, Poverty Bay, on 20 January 1840. The schools run by William and Jane were well attended; the school opened with five classes for men, two classes for women and classes for boys. Classes covered practical knowledge as well as teaching of the scriptures.

Early missionary schools were often conducted in the Māori language, which was the predominant language throughout the early part of the 19th century. Māori who had attended mission schools set up their own schools back in their villages. By the 1860s, three-quarters of the Māori population could read in Māori and two-thirds could write in Māori. 

The Education Ordinance of 1847 provided some funding for mission schools and required them to conduct classes in English in order to receive the subsidies. Te Aute College was established by Samuel Williams of the CMS in 1854. The Native Schools Act 1858 continued the subsidies for church boarding schools for Māori. The mission schools struggled to conduct all teaching in English, and many continued to teach in Māori. The Roman Catholic St Joseph&#x27;s Māori Girls&#x27; College was established by the Sisters of Our Lady of the Missions in 1867.

The New Zealand Wars caused many of the mission schools to close. However, Te Aute College and St Joseph&#x27;s Māori Girls&#x27; College, both in Hawke&#x27;s Bay, were not impacted by the wars. The Anglican Hukarere Girls&#x27; College was established in Napier in 1875. Catholic priests and brothers established other schools for Māori, including Hato Petera College (Auckland) in 1928 and Hato Paora College (Feilding) in 1947.

==Native schools==
The Native Schools Act of 1867 was a major shift in policy. Rather than helping churches to rebuild mission schools after the wars, the government offered secular, state-controlled, primary schools to Māori communities who petitioned for them. In return for providing a suitable site, the government provided a school, teacher, books, and materials. Native school teachers frequently also provided medicines and medical advice to their pupils and their families, and acted as liaison between rural communities and the government. The schools were transferred from the Native Department to the Department of Education in 1879.

James Pope was appointed the organising inspector of native schools in January 1880 and later that year he issued a Native Schools Code that prescribed a curriculum, established qualifications for teachers, and standardised operation for the native schools. The primary mission was to assimilate Māori into European culture. Māori could attend Board of Education schools and non-Māori could attend native schools, although the primary purpose of the native schools was providing European education for Māori. 

=== English language teaching ===

Section 21 of the Native Schools Act 1867 states:No school shall receive any grant unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the Colonial Secretary by the report of the inspector or otherwise as the Colonial Secretary shall think fit that the English language and the ordinary subjects of primary English education are taught by a competent teacher and that the instruction is carried on in the English language as far as practicable Provided always that it shall be lawful for the Colonial Secretary to contribute to the maintenance or salaries of such Native teachers as shall conduct Native Schools in remote districts when it may be found impossible to provide English teachers.The Native Schools Code published in 1880 stated that &quot;the Native children must be taught to read and write the English language, and to speak it&quot; and alsoIt is not necessary that teachers should, at the time of their appointment, be acquainted with the Maori tongue; but they may find it desirable to learn enough Māori to enable them to communicate with the adult Natives. In all cases English is to be used by the teacher when he is instructing the senior classes. In the junior classes the Maori language may be used for the purpose of making the children acquainted with the meanings of English words and sentences. The aim of the teacher, however, should be to dispense with the use of Maori in school as soon as possible.

In 1906 the Inspector of Native Schools, William Bird, reported to the Inspector-General of Schools:

I should like to impress upon both teachers and committees the necessity for encouraging the children to talk English on the playground, and to see that this is done as much as possible. There are many schools in which this habit is regularly practised, and it is very encouraging to hear the young Maori children calling to one another in English as they chase each other about the playground. I may inform teachers that it has been alleged that an important distinction exists in this very respect between the Maori children attending a Board school and those attending one of our own Native schools—namely, that the former speak English in the playground, while the latter speak Maori. I hope that teachers will do their best to give this statement a practical denial, and to take every care to impress upon the children the necessity of practising outside school the lessons they learn within it.

Although children were to be encouraged to speak English, there was never an official policy banning children from speaking Māori. However, some native school committees made rules to that effect, a practice that persisted well into the 20th century. This contributed to the decline in the general use of Māori.

=== Other curriculum issues ===
In the late 1800s, George Hogben, Director of Education, implemented the policy of removing academic subjects, such as Latin, Euclidean geometry and algebra, which were subjects that were part of the matriculation programme for entry to a university, and focused the curriculum of native schools on agricultural and technical instruction and domestic skills. It was pointed out that there was nothing to stop a Māori from learning classics, maths and algebra (for example) at a regular public school. Regarding Te Aute College, there was a recommendation in 1906 that &quot;having regard to the circumstances of the Maoris as owners of considerable areas of suitable agricultural and pastoral land, it is necessary to give prominence in the curriculum to manual and technical instruction in agriculture. This view was supported by Māori politicians. William Bird, Inspector of Native Schools, expressed the opinion that the objective of Māori education should be to prepare pupils for life among Māori where they could take the skills they had learned to improve the lives of people in their home villages.

In 1912, the government was considering handing control of native schools from the Education Department to local Education Boards. Members of Parliament Āpirana Ngata and Te Rangihīroa spoke against suddenly doing so, saying that &quot;far better results were attained by Maori children at Native schools than at public schools. The reason was that at public schools Maori children, to whom English was a foreign language, were placed side by side with white children, who had obtained a colloquical [sic] knowledge of English in their own homes. In the Native schools special attention was paid to the teaching of English&quot;. Ngata said that Māori were suspicious that their children did not receive the same attention at board schools as at native schools.

In 1929 history was added to the native school curriculum, with teachers being advised to emphasise Māori and New Zealand history, and in 1930 a new primary school syllabus was introduced to board schools and (with modifications) to native schools. The new syllabus was criticised by an ex-Inspector of Native Schools in 1936. He stated that:The Maori language has been degraded and corrupted, and the young Maori has learned to aspire after pakeha ideas, sports and fashions and to despise Maori ways. The idea that the Maori would soon be absorbed into the pakeha population was one stultifying cause, and another was the lust for examination results inherent in a system run by ex-teachers and easily communicated to parents and the public. The most urgent reform in the education of the Maori is to restore and preserve the Maori language. Thousands of Maori children cannot speak Maori. This is a great loss.At a Māori conference in 1936 the subject of teaching Māori language was discussed and attendees pointed out that children in native schools were punished for speaking Māori. Academics at Auckland University College supported the view from the conference that Māori language and culture should be fostered at native schools, but by 1939 the Inspector of Native Schools was able to state that pupils seemed to be thinking in English more often and translating more easily from Māori to English.

=== Decline of Māori schools ===
In 1947 George Brown, the only Māori on the Hawkes Bay Education Board, suggested that board schools and native schools should be unified completely under one system. He pointed out that most Māori children attended board schools and felt there was no longer any need for separate schools, unless there was a demand for a completely separate system.

Native schools became known as &quot;Māori schools&quot; following the Maori Purposes Act 1947, under which all government usage switched from &#x27;Native&#x27; to &#x27;Maori&#x27;. The number of Māori schools began to decline in the 1950s. In 1958 almost 70 per cent of Māori children attended a board school, but there were still 157 Māori schools (down from 166 in 1955). The government&#x27;s long-term policy was to transfer Māori schools to the control of education boards, in consultation with local Māori communities. The New Zealand Official Yearbook stated:The language of instruction in the Maori schools is English, but the schools are not completely English in outlook, for Maori arts and crafts, song, legend, and history are taught. Methods of teaching are practical, and objectives closely related to the special needs of the Maori people. In many of the Maori schools, such equipment as woodwork rooms, cookery rooms, model cottages, baths, hot and cold showers, and laundries is supplied. Health education is featured in every Maori school.The number of Māori schools continued to decline, and by 1968 there were only 108 Māori primary schools with a total of 8200 pupils, including 749 non-Māori children. 85 percent of Māori children attended state primary schools controlled by education boards, 11.1 percent were at Māori schools controlled directly by the Education Department, and 3.8 percent attended private schools (including Māori private schools). The principal of Kaeo District High School noted that children from small Māori schools were hampered at secondary school because they did not have a good grasp of English. He stated that: “We have frequently discovered that children of even seven or eight years have no English word for quite common everyday things. Children such as these speak neither English nor Maori at home but a sort of pidgin mixture of both languages&quot;. 

In 1968 the Prime Minister announced that all state Māori schools would be put under the management of education boards, and the last 108 native schools were transferred to the control of boards by the beginning of 1969. The aim was to deliver a better service to Māori pupils.

<text>Diving physics, or the physics of underwater diving, is the basic aspects of physics which describe the effects of the underwater environment on the underwater diver and their equipment, and the effects of blending, compressing, and storing breathing gas mixtures, and supplying them for use at ambient pressure. These effects are mostly consequences of immersion in water, the hydrostatic pressure of depth and the effects of pressure and temperature on breathing gases. An understanding of the physics behind is useful when considering the physiological effects of diving, breathing gas planning and management, diver buoyancy control and trim, and the hazards and risks of diving.

Changes in density of breathing gas affect the ability of the diver to breathe effectively, and variations in partial pressure of breathing gas constituents have profound effects on the health and ability to function underwater of the diver.

== Aspects of physics with particular relevance to diving ==

The main laws of physics that describe the influence of the underwater diving environment on the diver and diving equipment include:

===Buoyancy===
Archimedes&#x27; principle (Buoyancy) - Ignoring the minor effect of surface tension, an object, wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. Thus, when in water, the weight of the volume of water displaced as compared to the weight of the diver&#x27;s body and the diver&#x27;s equipment, determine whether the diver floats or sinks. Buoyancy control, and being able to maintain neutral buoyancy in particular, is an important safety skill. The diver needs to understand buoyancy to effectively and safely operate drysuits, buoyancy compensators, diving weighting systems and lifting bags.

===Pressure===
The concept of pressure as force distributed over area, and the variation of pressure with immersed depth are central to the understanding of the physiology of diving, particularly the physiology of decompression and of barotrauma.

The absolute pressure on an ambient pressure diver is the sum of the local atmospheric pressure and hydrostatic pressure. Hydrostatic pressure is the component of ambient pressure due to the weight of the water column above the depth, and is commonly described in terms of metres or feet of sea water. 

The partial pressures of the component gases in a breathing gas mixture control the rate of diffusion into and out of the blood in the lungs, and their concentration in the arterial blood, and the concentration of blood gases affects their physiological effects in the body tissues. Partial pressure calculations are used in breathing gas blending and analysis

A class of diving hazards commonly referred to as delta-P hazards are caused by a pressure difference other than variation of ambient pressure with depth. This pressure difference causes flow that may entrain the diver and carry them to places where injury could occur, such as the intake to a marine thruster or a sluice gate.

===Gas property changes===
Gas equations of state, which may be expressed in combination as the Combined gas law, or the Ideal gas law within the range of pressures normally encountered by divers, or as the traditionally expressed gas laws relating the relationships between two properties when the others are held constant, are used to calculate variations of pressure, volume and temperature, such as: Boyle&#x27;s law, which describes the change in volume with a change in pressure at a constant temperature. For example, the volume of gas in a non-rigid container (such as a diver&#x27;s lungs or buoyancy compensation device), decreases as external pressure increases while the diver descends in the water. Likewise, the volume of gas in such non-rigid containers increases on the ascent. Changes in the volume of gases in the diver and the diver&#x27;s equipment affect buoyancy. This creates a positive feedback loop on both ascent and descent. The quantity of open circuit gas breathed by a diver increases with pressure and depth. Charles&#x27;s law, which describes the change in volume with a change in temperature at a fixed pressure, Gay-Lussac&#x27;s second law, which describes the change of pressure with a change of temperature for a fixed volume, (originally described by Guillaume Amontons, and sometimes called Amontons&#x27;s law). This explains why a diver who enters cold water with a warm diving cylinder, for instance after a recent quick fill, finds the gas pressure of the cylinder drops by an unexpectedly large amount during the early part of the dive as the gas in the cylinder cools.

In mixtures of breathing gases the concentration of the individual components of the gas mix is proportional to their partial pressures and volumetric gas fraction. Gas fraction is constant for the components of a mixture, but partial pressure changes in proportion to changes in the total pressure. Partial pressure is a useful measure for expressing limits for avoiding nitrogen narcosis and oxygen toxicity. Dalton&#x27;s law describes the combination of partial pressures to form the total pressure of the mixture. 

Gases are highly compressible but liquids are almost incompressible. Gas spaces in the diver&#x27;s body and gas held in flexible equipment contract as the diver descends and expand as the diver ascends. When constrained from free expansion and contraction, gases will exert unbalanced pressure on the walls of their containment, which can cause damage or injury known as barotraum if excessive.

===Solubility of gases and diffusion===

Henry&#x27;s law describes how as pressure increases the quantity of gas that can be dissolved in the tissues of the body increases. This effect is involved in nitrogen narcosis, oxygen toxicity and decompression sickness.

Concentration of gases dissolved in the body tissues affects a number of physiological processed and is influenced by diffusion rates, solubility of the components of the breathing gas in the tissues of the body and pressure. Given sufficient time under a specific pressure, tissues will saturate with the gases, and no more will be absorbed until the pressure increases. When the pressure decreases faster than the dissolved gas can be eliminated, the concentration rises and supersaturation occurs, and pre-existing bubble nuclei may grow. Bubble formation and growth in decompression sickness is affected by surface tension of the bubbles, as well as pressure changes and supersaturation. 

===Density effects===
The density of the breathing gas is proportional to absolute pressure, and affects the breathing performance of regulators and the work of breathing, which affect the capacity of the diver to work, and in extreme cases, to breathe. Density of the water, the diver&#x27;s body, and equipment, determines the diver&#x27;s apparent weight in water, and therefore their buoyancy, and influences the use of buoyant equipment. Density and the force of gravity are the factors in the generation of hydrostatic pressure. Divers use high density materials such as lead for diving weighting systems and low density materials such as air in buoyancy compensators and lifting bags.

===Viscosity effects===
The absolute (dynamic) viscosity of water is higher (order of 100 times) than that of air. This increases the drag on an object moving through water, and more effort is required for propulsion in water than air relative to the speed of movement. Viscosity also affects the work of breathing.

===Heat balance===

Thermal conductivity of water is higher than that of air. As water conducts heat 20 times more than air, and has a much higher thermal capacity, heat transfer from a diver&#x27;s body to water is faster than to air, and to avoid excessive heat loss leading to hypothermia, thermal insulation in the form of diving suits, or active heating is used. Gases used in diving have very different thermal conductivities; Heliox, and to a lesser extent, trimix, conducts heat faster than air because of the helium content, and argon conducts heat slower than air, so technical divers breathing gases containing helium may inflate their dry suits with argon. Some thermal conductivity values at 25 °C and sea level atmospheric pressure: argon: 16 mW/m/K; air: 26 mW/m/K; neoprene: 50 mW/m/K; wool felt: 70 mW/m/K; helium: 142 mW/m/K; water: 600 mW/m/K.

===Underwater vision===

Underwater vision is affected by the refractive index of water, which is similar to that of the cornea of the eye, and which is about 30% greater than air. Snell&#x27;s law describes the angle of refraction relative to the angle of incidence. This similarity in refractive index is the reason a diver cannot see clearly underwater without a diving mask with an internal airspace. Absorption of light depends on wavelength, this causes loss of colour underwater. The red end of the spectrum of light is absorbed over a short distance, and is lost even in shallow water. Divers use artificial light underwater to reveal these absorbed colours. In deeper water no light from the surface penetrates, and artificial lighting is necessary to see at all. Underwater vision is also affected by turbidity, which causes scattering, and dissolved materials which absorb light.

===Underwater acoustics===
Underwater acoustics affect the ability of the diver to hear through the hood of the diving suit or the helmet, and the ability to judge the direction of a source of sound.

== Environmental physical phenomena of interest to divers ==

The physical phenomena found in large bodies of water that may have a practical influence on divers include:
* Effects of weather such as wind, which causes waves, and changes of temperature and atmospheric pressure on and in the water. Even moderately high winds can prevent diving because of the increased risk of becoming lost at sea or injured. Low water temperatures make it necessary for divers to wear diving suits and can cause problems such as freezing of diving regulators.
* Haloclines, or strong, vertical salinity gradients. For instance, where fresh water enters the sea, the fresh water floats over the denser saline water and may not mix immediately. Sometimes visual effects, such as shimmering and reflection, occur at the boundary between the layers, because the refractive indices differ.
* Ocean currents can transport water over thousands of kilometres, and may bring water with different temperature and salinity into a region. Some ocean currents have a huge effect on local climate, for instance the warm water of the North Atlantic drift moderates the climate of the north west coast of Europe. The speed of water movement can affect dive planning and safety.
* Thermoclines, or sudden changes in temperature. Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a &quot;thermocline&quot;.
* Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends. 
* In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.
* Water at near-freezing temperatures is less dense than slightly warmer water - maximum density of water is at about 4 °C - so when near freezing, water may be slightly warmer at depth than at the surface.
* Tidal currents and changes in sea level caused by gravitational forces and the Earth&#x27;s rotation. Some dive sites can only be dived safely at slack water when the tidal cycle reverses and the current slows. Strong currents can cause problems for divers. Buoyancy control can be difficult when a strong current meets a vertical surface. Divers consume more breathing gas when swimming against currents. Divers on the surface can be separated from their boat cover by currents. On the other hand, drift diving is only possible when there is a reasonable current.

<doc id="474936" wikidata="Q1047845" url="?curid=474936" title="Self-oscillation">
<text>Self-oscillation is the generation and maintenance of a periodic motion by a source of power that lacks any corresponding periodicity. The oscillator itself controls the phase with which the external power acts on it. Self-oscillators are therefore distinct from forced and parametric resonators, in which the power that sustains the motion must be modulated externally. 

In linear systems, self-oscillation appears as an instability associated with a negative damping term, which causes small perturbations to grow exponentially in amplitude. This negative damping is due to a positive feedback between the oscillation and the modulation of the external source of power. The amplitude and waveform of steady self-oscillations are determined by the nonlinear characteristics of the system. 

Self-oscillations are important in physics, engineering, biology, and economics.

== History of the subject ==

The study of self-oscillators dates back to the early 1830s, with the work of Robert Willis and George Biddell Airy on the mechanism by which the vocal cords produce the human voice. Another instance of self-oscillation, associated with the unstable operation of centrifugal governors, was studied mathematically by James Clerk Maxwell in 1867. In the second edition of his treatise on &quot;The Theory of Sound&quot;, published in 1896, Lord Rayleigh considered various instances of mechanical and acoustic self-oscillations (which he called &quot;maintained vibration&quot;) and offered a simple mathematical model for them.

Interest in the subject of self-oscillation was also stimulated by the work of Heinrich Hertz, starting in 1887, in which he used a spark-gap transmitter to generate radio waves that he showed correspond to electrical oscillations with frequencies of hundreds of millions of cycles per second. Hertz&#x27;s work led to the development of wireless telegraphy. The first detailed theoretical work on such electrical self-oscillation was carried out by Henri Poincaré in the early 20th century.

The term &quot;self-oscillation&quot; (also translated as &quot;auto-oscillation&quot;) was coined by the Soviet physicist Aleksandr Andronov, who studied them in the context of the mathematical theory of the structural stability of dynamical systems. Other important work on the subject, both theoretical and experimental, was due to André Blondel, Balthasar van der Pol, Alfred-Marie Liénard, and Philippe Le Corbeiller in the 20th century. 

The same phenomenon is sometimes labelled as &quot;maintained&quot;, &quot;sustained&quot;, &quot;self-exciting&quot;, &quot;self-induced&quot;, &quot;spontaneous&quot;, or &quot;autonomous&quot; oscillation. Unwanted self-oscillations are known in the mechanical engineering literature as hunting, and in electronics as parasitic oscillations.

==Mathematical basis==

Self-oscillation is manifested as a linear instability of a dynamical system&#x27;s static equilibrium. Two mathematical tests that can be used to diagnose such an instability are the Routh–Hurwitz and Nyquist criteria. The amplitude of the oscillation of an unstable system grows exponentially with time (i.e., small oscillations are negatively damped), until nonlinearities become important and limit the amplitude. This can produce a steady and sustained oscillation. In some cases, self-oscillation can be seen as resulting from a time lag in a closed loop system, which makes the change in variable &quot;xt&quot; dependent on the variable &quot;xt-1&quot; evaluated at an earlier time.

Simple mathematical models of self-oscillators involve negative linear damping and positive non-linear damping terms, leading to a Hopf bifurcation and the appearance of limit cycles. The van der Pol oscillator is one such model that has been used extensively in the mathematical literature.

==Examples in engineering==

===Railway and automotive wheels===
Hunting oscillation in railway wheels and shimmy in automotive tires can cause an uncomfortable wobbling effect, which in extreme cases can derail trains and cause cars to lose grip.

===Central heating thermostats===
Early central heating thermostats were guilty of self-exciting oscillation because they responded too quickly. The problem was overcome by hysteresis, i.e., making them switch state only when the temperature varied from the target by a specified minimum amount.

===Automatic transmissions===
Self-exciting oscillation occurred in early automatic transmission designs when the vehicle was traveling at a speed which was between the ideal speeds of 2 gears. In these situations the transmission system would switch almost continuously between the 2 gears, which was both annoying and hard on the transmission. Such behavior is now inhibited by introducing hysteresis into the system.

===Steering of vehicles when course corrections are delayed===
There are many examples of self-exciting oscillation caused by delayed course corrections, ranging from light aircraft in a strong wind to erratic steering of road vehicles by a driver who is inexperienced or drunk.

=== SEIG (self-excited induction generator) ===
If an induction motor is connected to a capacitor and the shaft turns above synchronous speed, it operates as a self-excited induction generator.

===Self-exciting transmitters===
Many early radio systems tuned their transmitter circuit, so the system automatically created radio waves of the desired frequency. This design has given way to designs that use a separate oscillator to provide a signal that is then amplified to the desired power.

==Examples in other fields==

===Population cycles in biology===

For example, a reduction in population of an herbivore species because of predation, this makes the populations of predators of that species decline, the reduced level of predation allows the herbivore population to increase, this allows the predator population to increase, etc. Closed loops of time-lagged differential equations are a sufficient explanation for such cycles - in this case the delays are caused mainly by the breeding cycles of the species involved.

<text>In computer science, geometric hashing is a method for efficiently finding two-dimensional objects represented by discrete points that have undergone an affine transformation, though extensions exist to other object representations and transformations. In an off-line step, the objects are encoded by treating each pair of points as a geometric basis. The remaining points can be represented in an invariant fashion with respect to this basis using two parameters. For each point, its quantized transformed coordinates are stored in the hash table as a key, and indices of the basis points as a value. Then a new pair of basis points is selected, and the process is repeated. In the on-line (recognition) step, randomly selected pairs of data points are considered as candidate bases. For each candidate basis, the remaining data points are encoded according to the basis and possible correspondences from the object are found in the previously constructed table. The candidate basis is accepted if a sufficiently large number of the data points index a consistent object basis.

Geometric hashing was originally suggested in computer vision for object recognition in 2D and 3D, but later was applied to different problems such as structural alignment of proteins.

== Geometric hashing in computer vision ==
Geometric hashing is a method used for object recognition. Let’s say that we want to check if a model image can be seen in an input image. This can be accomplished with geometric hashing. The method could be used to recognize one of the multiple objects in a base, in this case the hash table should store not only the pose information but also the index of object model in the base.

=== Example ===
For simplicity, this example will not use too many point features and assume that their descriptors are given by their coordinates only (in practice local descriptors such as SIFT could be used for indexing).

==== Training Phase ====

# Find the model&#x27;s feature points. Assume that 5 feature points are found in the model image with the coordinates formula_1formula_2formula_3formula_4formula_5, see the picture.
# Introduce a basis to describe the locations of the feature points. For 2D space and similarity transformation the basis is defined by a pair of points. The point of origin is placed in the middle of the segment connecting the two points (P2, P4 in our example), the formula_6 axis is directed towards one of them, the formula_7 is orthogonal and goes through the origin. The scale is selected such that absolute value of formula_6 for both basis points is 1.
# Describe feature locations with respect to that basis, i.e. compute the projections to the new coordinate axes. The coordinates should be discretised to make recognition robust to noise, we take the bin size 0.25. We thus get the coordinates formula_9formula_10formula_11formula_12formula_13
# Store the basis in a hash table indexed by the features (only transformed coordinates in this case). If there were more objects to match with, we should also store the object number along with the basis pair.
# Repeat the process for a different basis pair (Step 2). It is needed to handle occlusions. Ideally, all the non-colinear pairs should be enumerated. We provide the hash table after two iterations, the pair (P1, P3) is selected for the second one.

Hash Table:

Most hash tables cannot have identical keys mapped to different values. So in real life one won’t encode basis keys (1.0, 0.0) and (-1.0, 0.0) in a hash table.

==== Recognition Phase ====
# Find interesting feature points in the input image.
# Choose an arbitrary basis. If there isn&#x27;t a suitable arbitrary basis, then it is likely that the input image does not contain the target object.
# Describe coordinates of the feature points in the new basis. Quantize obtained coordinates as it was done before.
# Compare all the transformed point features in the input image with the hash table. If the point features are identical or similar, then increase the count for the corresponding basis (and the type of object, if any).
# For each basis such that the count exceeds a certain threshold, verify the hypothesis that it corresponds to an image basis chosen in Step 2. Transfer the image coordinate system to the model one (for the supposed object) and try to match them. If successful, the object is found. Otherwise, go back to Step 2.

=== Finding mirrored pattern ===
It seems that this method is only capable of handling scaling, translation, and rotation. However, the input image may contain the object in mirror transform. Therefore, geometric hashing should be able to find the object, too. There are two ways to detect mirrored objects.

# For the vector graph, make the left side positive, and the right side negative. Multiplying the x position by -1 will give the same result.
# Use 3 points for the basis. This allows detecting mirror images (or objects). Actually, using 3 points for the basis is another approach for geometric hashing.

=== Geometric hashing in higher-dimensions ===
Similar to the example above, hashing applies to higher-dimensional data. For three-dimensional data points, three points are also needed for the basis. The first two points define the x-axis, and the third point defines the y-axis (with the first point). The z-axis is perpendicular to the created axis using the right-hand rule. Notice that the order of the points affects the resulting basis

<text>Soy milk, also known as soya milk or soymilk, is a plant-based milk produced by soaking and grinding soybeans, boiling the mixture, and filtering out remaining particulates. It is a stable emulsion of oil, water, and protein. Its original form is an intermediate product of the manufacture of tofu. Originating in China, it became a common beverage in Europe and North America in the latter half of the 20th century, especially as production techniques were developed to give it a taste and consistency more closely resembling that of dairy milk. Soy milk may be used as a substitute for dairy milk by individuals who are vegan or lactose intolerant.

Soy milk is also used in making imitation dairy products such as soy yogurt, soy cream, soy kefir, and soy-based cheese analogues. It is also used as an ingredient for making milkshakes, pancakes, smoothies, bread, mayonnaise, and baked goods.
== Names ==
In some parts of China, the term 豆浆 &quot;dòujiāng&quot; (&quot;bean broth&quot;) is used for the traditional watery beverage produced as an intermediate product in the production of tofu, while store-bought products designed to imitate the flavor and consistency of dairy milk (and may contain a mixture of dairy and soy), are more often known as 豆奶 &quot;dòunǎi&quot; (&quot;bean milk&quot;).

In other countries, there are sometimes legal impediments to the equivalents of the name &quot;soy milk&quot;. In such jurisdictions, the manufacturers of plant milks typically label their products the equivalent of &quot;soy beverage&quot; or &quot;soy drink&quot;.

=== Naming in the EU ===
In the European Union, &quot;milk&quot; by law refers exclusively to &quot;the normal mammary secretion obtained from one or more milkings without either addition thereto or extraction therefrom&quot;. Only cow&#x27;s milk is allowed to be named &quot;milk&quot; on packaging, and any other milks must state the name of the respective animal: for example, &quot;goat milk&quot; or &quot;sheep milk&quot;. There are exceptions for traditional products such as coconut milk. The usage of the term &quot;soy milk&quot; became the subject of a 2017 court case before the Court of Justice of the European Union after a German consumer protection group filed an unfair competition complaint about a company describing its soy and tofu products as &#x27;milk&#x27; or &#x27;cheese&#x27;. The Court of Justice ruled that such designations cannot be legally used for purely plant-based products and that additions indicating the plant origin of the products (&quot;soy&quot; milk) does not influence that prohibition.

== History ==
The earliest record of soybean milk is on a stone slab of the Eastern Han dynasty unearthed in China, on which is engraved the situation of making soy milk in ancient kitchens.

A tofu broth (&quot;doufujiang&quot;) was used during the Mongol Yuan. As &quot;doujiang&quot;, this drink remains a common watery form of soy milk in China, usually prepared from fresh soybeans. The compendium of Materia Medica, which was completed in 1578, also has an evaluation of soymilk. Its use increased during the Qing dynasty, apparently due to the discovery that gently heating &quot;doujiang&quot; for at least 90 minutes hydrolyzed or helped to break down its undesirable raffinose and stachyose, oligosaccharides, which can cause flatulence and digestive pain among lactose-intolerant adults. By the 18th century, it was common enough that street vendors were hawking it; in the 19th, it was also common to take a cup to tofu shops to get hot, fresh &quot;doujiang&quot; for breakfast. It was already often paired with youtiao, which was dipped into it. The process was industrialized in early Republican China. By 1929, two Shanghai factories were selling over 1000 bottles a day and another in Beijing was almost as productive itself. Following disruption from the Second World War and the Chinese Civil War, soy milk began to be marketed in soft drink-like fashion in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan in the 1950s.

Soymilk was mentioned in various European letters from China beginning in the 17th century. &quot;Soy milk&quot; entered the English language (as &quot;soy-bean milk&quot;) in an 1897 USDA report. Li Yuying established Caséo-Sojaïne, the first soy milk &quot;dairy&quot;, in Colombes, France, in 1910; he received the first British and American patents for soy milk manufacturing in 1912 and 1913. J.A. Chard began production of &quot;Soy Lac&quot; in New York City, United States, in 1917. Harry W. Miller—an American businessman forced to relocate his factory from Shanghai owing to World War II—was similarly compelled by the USDA and the US dairy industry to use the term &quot;Soya Lac&quot; rather than &quot;soy milk&quot;. John Harvey Kellogg had been working with what he called &quot;soymilk&quot; at his Battle Creek Sanitarium since 1930, but was similarly compelled to market his acidophilus-enriched beverage as &quot;Soygal&quot; when it began commercial production in 1942.

A string of 40 court cases against Rich Products between 1949 and 1974 finally established that non-dairy &quot;milks&quot; and imitation dairy products were &quot;a new and distinct food&quot;, rather than inferior and illegal knock-offs. Cornell researchers established the enzyme lipoxygenase as responsible for the &quot;beany&quot; flavor of soy milk made in 1966; the same research established a process for reducing or eliminating the bean flavor from commercial products. With Tetra Pak cartons extending its shelf-life, Hong Kong-based Vitasoy reintroduced soy milk to the US market in 1980 and brought it to 20 other countries within a few years. Alpro similarly began production in Belgium in 1980, quickly becoming Europe&#x27;s leading producer. New production technology and techniques began to permit soy beverages with an appreciably more milk-like flavor and consistency in the mid-1980s.

== Preparation ==

Soy milk is made from whole soybeans or full-fat soy flour. The dry beans are soaked in water for a minimum of three hours up to overnight depending on the temperature of the water. The rehydrated beans then undergo wet grinding with enough added water to give the desired solids content to the final product which has a protein content of 1–4%, depending on the method of production. The ratio of water to beans on a weight basis is 10:1 for traditional soy milk. The resulting slurry or purée is brought to a boil to improve its taste properties (see &quot;Soy odor&quot; below), by heat inactivating soybean trypsin inhibitor, and to sterilize the product. Heating at or near the boiling point is continued for a period of time, 15–20 minutes, followed by the removal of insoluble residues (soy pulp fiber) by straining/filtration.

Processing requires the use of an anti-foaming agent or natural defoamer during the boiling step. Bringing filtered soy milk to a boil avoids the problem of foaming. It is generally opaque, white or off-white in color, and approximately the same consistency as cow&#x27;s milk. Quality attributes during preparation include germination time for the beans used, acidity, total protein and carbohydrates, phytic acid content, and viscosity. Raw soy milk may be sweetened, flavored, and fortified with micronutrients. Once fully processed, soy milk products are typically sold in plastic bottles or plastic-coated cartons, such as tetrapaks.

=== Soy odor ===
Traditional East Asian soymilk has a &quot;beany&quot; odor, partly of hexanal, considered disagreeable by most Westerners. This is caused by the lipooxygenase (LOX) in the soy oxidizing the fat in the beans. Rehydrating the beans allows the reaction to proceed with the oxygen gas dissolved in soaking water. To eliminate the odor, one can either disable the LOX enzyme with heat or remove the oxygen dissolved in the water. The former can be achieved by soaking beans in hot water (a &quot;hot grind&quot;), skipping the soak entirely, or blanching the soy in water or steam first. The latter can be achieved by a variety of chemical means, such as adding glucose and glucose oxidase to consume the oxygen. The soybean cultivar also influences the odor and a mutant cultivar lacking LOX completely has been produced.

The issue and preference of soy odor also affects products made from soymilk, especially tofu. See .

==Commerce==
With soybean production increasing worldwide during the early 21st century, and consumer interest in plant milks growing from demand in Asia, Europe, and the United States, soy milk became the second-most consumed plant milk (after almond milk) by 2019. Soy milk sales declined in the United States during 2018–19, mainly due to the rising popularity of almond milk and loss of market share to the successful introduction of oat milk.

According to market research in 2019, the worldwide market for soy milk was growing at an annual rate of 6%, and was forecast to reach $11 billion in total commerce by 2025. Growth in consumption was due mainly to expanding the flavors of sweetened soy milks and uses in desserts, whereas unsweetened soy milk was being used particularly in Asia-Pacific countries as an ingredient in snacks and various prepared foods.

== Usage ==
=== Nutrition ===
A cup (243 mL) serving of a generic unsweetened commercial nutrient-fortified brand of soy milk provides 80 calories from 4 g of carbohydrates (including 1 g of sugar), 4 g of fat and 7 g of protein. This processed soy milk contains appreciable levels of vitamin A, B vitamins, and vitamin D in a range of 10 to 45% of the Daily Value, with calcium and magnesium also in significant content.

It has a glycemic index of 34±4. For protein quality, one study gave soya milk a Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS) of 78% for infants, 99% for young children, and 117% for older children, adolescents, and adults, with the limiting amino acid for those groups being leucine, lysine, and valine respectively. A DIAAS of 100% or more is considered to be an excellent/high protein quality source.

=== Taste ===

Manufactured, sweetened soy milk has an oatmeal-like, nutty flavor. In acidic hot drinks, such as coffee, curdling may occur, requiring some manufacturers to add acidity regulators.

====Phytic acid====
Soybeans, and soy milk in particular, contain phytic acid, which may act as a chelating agent and inhibit mineral absorption, especially for diets already low in minerals. However, dietary intake of phytic acid may help reduce the risk of developing colon cancer.

===Regional===
Soy milk is a common beverage in East Asian cuisines.

* In Chinese cuisine, &quot;sweet&quot; soy milk is made by adding cane sugar or simple syrup. &quot;Salty&quot; or &quot;savory&quot; soy milk is often combined with chopped pickled mustard greens, dried shrimp, &quot;youtiao&quot; croutons, chopped spring onions, cilantro, pork floss, and/or shallots, along with vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce, and/or chili oil. Both are traditional breakfast foods, served hot or cold depending on the season or personal preference. At breakfast, it is often accompanied by starchy carbohydrate-rich foods like &quot;mantou&quot; (a thick, fluffy kind of roll or bun), &quot;youtiao&quot; (deep-fried dough sticks), and &quot;shaobing&quot; (sesame flatbread).
* Japanese cuisine uses soy milk to make &quot;yuba&quot; and as an occasional base for &quot;nabemono&quot;.
* In Korean cuisine, soy milk is used as the broth for making &quot;kongguksu&quot;, a cold noodle soup eaten mostly in summer.

In many countries, soy milk is used in vegan and vegetarian food products and as a substituve replacement for cow&#x27;s milk in many recipes. Soy milk is also used in making imitation dairy products such as soy yogurt, soy cream, soy kefir and soy-based cheese analogues. It is also used as an ingredient for making milkshakes, pancakes, smoothies, bread, mayonnaise, and baked goods.

== Ecological effects ==
 Using soybeans to make milk instead of raising cows is ecologically advantageous. Cows require much more energy to produce milk, since the farmer must feed the animal, which can consume up to of food in dry matter basis and of water a day, producing an average of of milk a day. Legumes, including the soybean plant, also replenish the nitrogen content of the soil in which they are grown.

The cultivation of soybeans in South America is a cause of deforestation (specifically in the Amazon rainforest) and a range of other large-scale environmental harm. However, the majority of soybean cultivation worldwide, especially in South America where cattle farming is widespread, is intended for livestock fodder rather than soy milk production.

<doc id="474950" wikidata="Q2748196" url="?curid=474950" title="Culture of Croatia">
<text>The culture of Croatia has historically been influenced by Central European, Mediterranean, and Balkan cultures. Croatia&#x27;s unique culture and identity can be traced back to the historical llyricum. The Croatian language is believed to have been formed in the 6th or 7th century, with the written language present in Glagolitic texts from the 11th century. 

In terms of Croatian national emancipation, the 19th-century Illyrian movement led by Ljudevit Gaj was a key driver for emergence of Croatian romantic nationalism. During this movement, Croatians saw unprecedented developments in the fields of art and culture, giving rise to a number of historical figures. Most notably, Croatia has a place in the history of Mediterranean architecture and urbanism and clothing as place of origin of the &quot;cravat&quot;, a precursor of the modern necktie. 

Modern and contemporary arts, music, urban, independent, and youth culture in Croatia have grown due to numerous festivals and frequent manifestations, as well as the re-emergence of new cultural infrastructure around the country.

== History ==

=== Pre-historic heritage ===

Ancient monuments from the Paleolithic era consist of simple stone and bone objects. Some of the earliest remaining historical features include 100,000-year-old bones of a Neandertal man on Krapina Neanderthal site, in Hrvatsko Zagorje.The most interesting Copper Age or Eneolithic findings are from &quot;Vučedol culture&quot;. Out of that culture, the Bronze Age &quot;Vinkovci culture&quot; (named after the city of Vinkovci) developed, which is recognizable by bronze fibulas that were replacing objects like needles and buttons.

Bronze Age culture of Illyrians, ethnic group with distinct culture and art form started to organize itself in 7th century BC. Numerous monumental sculptures are preserved, as well as walls of citadel, &quot;Nezakcij&quot; near Pula, one of numerous Istrian cities from Iron Age.

=== Ancient heritage ===
During Greek colonisation period, Greeks from Syracuse arrived to islands of Vis (&quot;Issa&quot;), Hvar (&quot;Pharos&quot;), and Korčula (&quot;Corcyra Nigra&quot;) in 390 BC and founded their city-states on Adriatic parts of modern Croatia, where they lived quite isolated.
While the Greek colonies were flourishing on the island, on the continent, the Illyrians were organizing their centers. Their art was greatly influenced by Greek art, and they have even copied some elements. Illyrians sometimes attacked Greek colonies on Dalmatian islands. One such example was queen Teuta of Ardiaei, whose pirating activities drew the attention of the Roman Republic to Eastern Adriatic Coast in 229 BC. After this initial contact, Rome gradually managed to subdue the Illyrians by the 1st century and Great Iliryan Revolt. These lands were in the meantime organized into Roman provinces of Ilyricum and subsequently Dalmatia and Pannonia, while Ilirians and other native tribes living in these areas gradually became romanized.The Romans organized the entire coastal territory by transforming citadels to urban cities. There have been at least thirty cities in Istria, Liburnia and Dalmatia with Roman citizenship (civitas). The best-preserved networks of Roman streets (decumanus/cardo) are those in &quot;Epetion&quot; (&quot;Poreč&quot;) and &quot;Jader&quot; (Zadar). The best preserved Roman monuments are in &quot;Pola&quot; (Pula) including an Amphitheater (an arena) from the 2nd century.
In the 3rd century AD, the city of Salona was the largest (with 40,000 inhabitants) and most important city of Dalmatia. Near the city, emperor Diocletian, born in Salona, built Diocletian&#x27;s Palace (around year 300 AD), which is the largest and most important monument of late antique architecture in the World. In the 4th century, Salona became the center of Christianity for entire western Balkans. It had numerous basilicas and necropolises, and even two saints: &quot;Domnius&quot; (Duje) and Anastasius (&quot;Staš&quot;).

One of few preserved basilicas in western Europe (beside ones in Ravenna) from the time of early Byzantium is Euphrasian Basilica in Poreč from the 6th century.

=== Medieval heritage ===

The early Middle Ages brought the great migration of the Slavs and this period was perhaps a &quot;Dark Age&quot; in the cultural sense until the successful formation of the Slavic states which coexisted with Italic cities that remained on the coast, each of them were modelled like Venice.

In the 7th century the Croats, along with other Slavs and Avars, migrated from Eastern Europe to the area of Dalmatian hinterland. Here, the Croats came into contact with Roman art, culture, and most of all with Christianity. Before adopting Christianity Croats used to worship Slavic paganism, traces of which can be found on certain toponyms in Croatia, named after Slavic gods Perun and Veles. Some of these are located near Podstrana and on Učka mountain. Nevertheless, in first few centuries after their arrival, Croats converted to Christianity which had spread from old Roman cities in Dalmatia and from Frankish missionaries. In following centuries both Latin language, Church Slavonic and Glagolitic script were in use in Church liturgy among Croats, while pre-Romanesque period is considered foundational period of Croatian medieval culture. The monuments created in this period are associated with arrival of Benedictine monks to Croatia, who first came from Frankish monasteries and subsequently from Monte Cassino. In later periods, the new monasteries were mostly founded by local monks. The first benedictine monastery in Dalmatia was constructed during the reign of 9th century duke Trpimir in Rižinice between modern day Solin and Klis. 

In later period the rule of duke Branimir, in particular, is considered as a time of &quot;cultural blossom&quot; of Croatia due to construction of new churches, reconstruction of already existing churches, as well as five stone inscriptions mentioning Branimir&#x27;s name which remain preserved until this day. 

In second half of 10th century, Croatian queen Helen of Zadar, built a royal mausoleum in church of St. Stephen on the Island in what is today Solin. 

Another period of cultural blossom of Croatian kingdom came with the rule of 11th century king Demetruis Zvonimir. Since his rule was relatively stable, he donated many churches and monasteries. The most famous of his donations is recorded in Baška tablet, 11th century inscription written in Glagolitic script and Croatian language. It was discovered in village of Baška, on the island of Krk. It represents the earliest mention of Croatian royal name and royal title in Croatian language (Zvonimir, kralj hrvatski) for which it has a great significance in study of Croatian language. Original documents issued by Croatian medieval rulers were also written in Latin language and in either Beneventan, Carolingian minuscule or Gothic minuscule script. During the 13th century Croatian provost Dobroslav launched the construction of a romanesque Knin cathedral on a site of the earlier Benedictine menastery in Kapitul near Knin. Upon completion the cathedral became a seat of Knin bishop (previously Croatian bishop) until Ottoman invasions forced high clergy to move their seats elsewhere. During the archeological excavations in the 19th century, this site became a place where ornaments from Trpimirović dynasty were recovered.

=== Renaissance heritage ===
The Rennaisance period among Croats was influenced by wars against expanding Ottoman Empire, which slowed down Croatian cultural development. The downfall of the homeland left impression on Croatian writers, who expressed their mood in their oeuvres. Some examples of this are Petar Zoranić in his novel &quot;Planine&quot; (English: &quot;The Mountains&quot;), Šimun Kožičić Benja in his publication &quot;De Corvatiae desolatione&quot; (English: &quot;&quot;&quot;On the desolation of Croatia&quot;), Marko Marulić in his &quot;Molitva suprotiva Turkom&quot; (&quot;A Prayer Against the Turks&quot;) or Brne Karnarutić&#x27;s &quot;Vazetje Sigeta grada&quot; (English: &quot;The Taking of the City of Siget&quot;). Some other artists known for their works in Croatian lands at a time include sculptor Giorgio da Sebenico (known in Croatian as Juraj Dalmatinac), best known for his works on rennaisance Šibenik Cathedral, or perhaps Giulio Clovo (known in Croatian as Julije Klović) who is best known for his miniature paintings. 

=== Enlightment heritage ===
The enlightment period of Croatian history correlates with enlightened despotism rule of empress Maria Theresa and emperor Joseph II. Some of the literary works of Croatian enlightment period authors are &quot;Satir iliti divlji čovik&quot; (&quot;Satyr or the wild man&quot;) by Matija Antun Relković, &quot;Matijaš grabancijaš dijak&quot; by Tituš Brezovački, &quot;Razgovor ugodni naroda slovinskog&quot; (&quot;Pleasant Conversation of Slavic People&quot;) by Andrija Kačić Miošić as well as those of Baltazar Adam Krčelić, Matija Petar Katančić or Antun Kanižlić.

== Fine arts ==

===Sculpture===
The altar enclosure and windows of early medieval churches were highly decorated with a transparent shallow string-like ornament that is called Croatian interlace because the strings were threaded and rethreaded through themselves. Sometimes the engravings in early Croatian script–Glagolitic appear. Soon, the Glagolitic writings were replaced with Latin ones on altar boundaries and architraves of old-Croatian churches.

In Croatian Romanesque sculpture, we have a transformation from decorative interlace relief (Croatian interlace) to figurative relief. The best examples of Romanesque sculpture are: the wooden doors of the Split cathedral made by Andrija Buvina (c. 1220) and the stone portal of the Trogir cathedral by the artisan Radovan (c. 1240).
Zadar was an independent Venetian city. The most beautiful examples of Gothic humanism in Zadar represent reliefs in gilded metal on Chest of St Simeon, made by artisans from Milan in around 1380.

Most Croatian prominent sculptors of modern include Ivan Meštrović, Antun Augustinčić, Frano Kršinić and others.

===Painting===
Gothic painting is less well-preserved, and the finest works are in Istria such as the fresco-cycle of &quot;Vincent from Kastav&quot; in the &quot;Church of Holy Mary&quot; in &quot;Škriljinah&quot; near &quot;Beram&quot;, from 1474. From that time are two of the best and most decorated illuminated liturgical books made by monks from Split, &quot;Hvals’ Zbornik&quot; (today in Zagreb) and the &quot;Missal of the Bosnian Duke Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić&quot; (now in Istanbul).

The most prominent painter from Croatia was Federiko Benković who worked almost his entire life in Italy, while an Italian, &quot;Francesco Robba&quot;, did the best Baroque sculptures in Croatia.

In Austrian countries at the beginning of the 19th century the Romantic movement in Croatia was sentimental, gentle and subtle. Vlaho Bukovac brought the spirit of impressionism from Paris, and he strongly influenced the young artists (including the authors of &quot;Golden Hall&quot;). On the &quot;Millennium Exhibition&quot; in Budapest they were able to set aside all other artistic options in Austro-Hungary.

Modern art in Croatia began with the Secession ideas spreading from Vienna and Munich, and post-Impressionism from Paris. Young artists would study the latest trends and integrate them into their own work. Many strove to bring a native cultural identity into their art, for example themes of national history and legends, and some of the artwork during and following the First World War contained a strong political message against the ruling Austro-Hungarian state. As Croatian lands joined the Kingdom of Yugoslavia after the war, a change was noticeable in 1919 with a move to flatter forms, and signs of cubism and expressionism were evident. In the 1920s, the Earth Group sought to reflect reality and social issues in their art, a movement that also saw the development of naive art. By the 1930s there was a return to more simple, classical styles.

Following the Second World War, artists everywhere were searching for meaning and identity, leading to abstract expressionism in the U.S. and art informel in Europe. The early split with the rest of the Eastern Bloc in the new Socialist Yugoslavia which Croatia was a constituent republic of allowed for greater artistic freedom, with socialist realism style never truly taking hold. Bauhaus ideas led to geometric abstraction in paintings and simplified spaces in architecture. In the 1960s, non-conventional forms of visual expression took hold along with a more analytical approach to art, and a move towards new media, such as photography, video, computer art, performance art and installations, focusing more on the artists&#x27; process. Art of the 1970s was more conceptual, figurative and expressionist. However, the 1980s brought a return to more traditional painting and images.

==Architecture==
The oldest preserved examples of architecture in Croatia are the 9th century churches, with the largest and the most representative among them being Donatus of Zadar and Church of Holy Trinity, Split. Some of the first churches build by the Croats were royal sanctuaries, and the influences of Roman art were the strongest in Dalmatia where urbanization was most dense, and there were the largest number of monuments.
Along the coast, the architecture is Mediterranean with a strong influence of renaissance architecture in major urban areas best exemplified in works of Venetian Giorgio da Sebenico and Niccolò di Giovanni Fiorentino. 
Architecture in Croatia reflects influences of bordering nations. Austrian and Hungarian influence is visible in public spaces and buildings in the north and in the central regions. Large squares named after culture heroes, well-groomed parks, and pedestrian-only zones, are features of these orderly towns and cities, especially where large scale Baroque urban planning took place, for instance in Varaždin and Karlovac. Subsequent influence of the Art Nouveau was reflected in contemporary architecture.

== Design ==

A group of painters and architects that set the foundations of Croatian modern design was called Exat 51 (Experimental atelier). It existed in Croatian capital Zagreb between 1950 and 1956 and it consisted of architects: Bernardo Bernardi, Zdravko Bregovac, Zvonimir Radić, Božidar Rašica, Vjenceslav Richter, Vladimir Zarahović as well as painters: Vlado Kristl, Ivan Picelj and Aleksandar Srnec. Exat 51 advocated: abstract art, contemporary visual communications and synthesis of all forms of artistic creativity. It&#x27;s work influenced Croatian culture, art and even social relations. Out of forementioned Exat 51 members; Bernardo Bernardi is considered one of the greatest Croatian designers and an award awarded by Association of Croatian architects for design and decoration of the interior bears his name. 

By 1970&#x27;s and 1980&#x27;s as country became industrialised, its industry increasingly relied on its house design departments. However, as Croatia became ravaged by Croatian War of Independence and badly done privatization in the 1990&#x27;s, Croatian design stagnated until the turn of the century. That&#x27;s when new generation of designers designed new products which found their way on the international markets.

==Music and Performing arts==

===Music===
Music in Croatia has two major influences: Central European, present in the central and northern parts of the country including Slavonia, and Mediterranean, particularly present in the coastal regions of Dalmatia and Istria. 

In Croatia, both pop and rock are popular, and often incorporates Dalmatian or Slavonian folk elements. Since the mid-20th century, schlagers and chanson-inspired music have formed the backbone of the Croatian popular music. During 1990&#x27;s marked by Croatian War of Independence; Cro dance, or Cro trash music dominated in Croatian nightclubs. In recent times, the most popular music genre (especially among young Croatians) became Turbo folk. According to the 2018 sociological research conducted on high school students in six Croatian cities, the most common consumers of Turbo folk are students with right wing leaning and conservative values. It is more popular among females as well as among those enrolled in lower level educational programs.

Traditional humorous folk song of eastern Croatian region of Slavonia is called bećarac. It was recorded for the first time in 18th century by Croatian Enlightment author Matija Antun Relković. Since 2011, it is listed on UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List.

Porin is Croatian music award, named after Vatroslav Lisinski&#x27;s opera of the same name and inspired by an American Grammy award. It has been awarded each year since 1994. Croatian national television usually also organizes national song contest – Dora, whose winner represents Croatia on Eurovision. This contest was named after Croatian first, distinguished female composer Dora Pejačević.

===Theatre===

Croatian theatre dates back at least as far as the Middle Ages, with a combination of religious liturgical dramas, and secular performances of travelling entertainers. During the Renaissance, there was a flowering of dramatic writing and performances in Dalmatia, especially in Dubrovnik and on the island of Hvar. Notable playwrights of the time were Marin Držić and Hanibal Lucić.In other parts of Croatia, theatres started to appear in the late 18th, early 19th century in cities such as Split, Dubrovnik, Šibenik, Zadar, Osijek, Varaždin, Pula, Rijeka, and Zagreb. The development of a Croatian National Theatre evolved from Zagreb&#x27;s first city theatre on St Mark&#x27;s Square. Beginning in the 1860s, performances were increasingly written and given in Croatian.

Today, Croatia boasts a strong tradition of theatres and theatrical companies all round the country. Performances range from dramas and musicals for adults or children, youth theatre and puppet theatre. Croatia is also home to the world&#x27;s oldest Theatre of the Blind. Festivals are held in several locations in the summer.

==Literature==

The first known printing shop in Croatia was founded in late 15th century in Kosinj under financial support of Croatian magnate Ivan VIII Frankopan of Brinje, while its first known press operator was Ambroz Kacitić of Kolunić tribe. The oldest printed book in Croatian language is &quot;Missale Romanum Glagolitice (Misal po zakonu rimskog dvora)&quot; from 1483, likey also printed in Kosinj. It was printed in Glagolitic script. Other examples of Croatian incunabulae written on Glagolitic script could include: &quot;Missale of Senj (Senjski misal)&quot; from 1494 or &quot;General Confessions (Spovid općena)&quot; from 1496. The latter two were printed by a Glagolitic printing shop of Senj (Senjska glagoljska tiskara), which operated between 1494 and 1508.

Some of Croatian book fairs incluce Interliber held annually on Zagreb Fair (Velesajam) in November or Book Fair in Istria (Sa(n)jam knjige u Istri) held annually in Pula. According to a research conducted in 2022 among Croatians, the number of Croatians who read books is in decline. Among Croatian readers, 70% are highly educated. People living near Zagreb make 52% of Croatian readers, while 48% are females. 

==Media==

===Cinema===
First Croatian production company was called &quot;Croatia&quot; and in 1917, this company produced first Croatian feature film called &quot;Brcko in Zagreb&quot;. This film, as well as all other films made in Zagreb in interwar period are lost to this day. First film screening in Zagreb was held on 8 October 1896, when Lumiere brothers films were shown. 

From 1960&#x27;s to 1990&#x27;s Croatian production company Jadran Film became one of the largest film producers in Central Europe, for which it was called &quot;Croatian Hollywood&quot;. Some of well known international movie productions filmed in Croatia in that time were: &quot;Austerlitz&quot;, &quot;The Valley of Death&quot;, &quot;Death Train&quot; etc. However, Croatian War of Independence, and subsequent bad privatization led to company&#x27;s downfall, as Croatia lost the competitive advantage it had over other socialist block countries during Cold War. The sixties in particular are known as a &quot;golden age&quot; of film in Croatia.

In 1989/1990 and 1999/2000 &quot;One Song a Day Takes Mischief Away&quot; was proclaimed as best Croatian feature film of all time. However, in 2020, a 1958 movie &quot;H-8&quot; was proclaimed as best Croatian feature film of all time. The same election proclaimed Oscar winning &quot;Surogat&quot; as best Croatian animated film of all time, while &quot;Od 3 do 22&quot; was proclaimed the best Croatian documentary film of all times. Since 1992, Croatian society of film critics gives annual award &quot;Okatavijan&quot;, named after Croatian film pioneer Oktavijan Miletić.

Modern film production in Croatia is subsidized by Croatian Audiovisual Center (HAVC). Some of the well known film festivals held in Croatia are: Pula Film Festival, Zagreb Film Festival, Vukovar Film Festival, Motovun Film Festival, Animafest Zagreb or ZagrebDox. 

In recent years, indie cinemas of Zagreb started closing down. Out of 24 indie cinemas which used to operate in Zagreb, only 6 remained opened by 2018. First multiplex cinema in Croatia was opened in 2003 by German company CineStar. During summer period in Zagreb, outdoor cinema in Tuškanac forest is open. This cinema was originally opened back in 1954. After it was shut down for several decades after 1970, it was again refurbished and reopened in 2012.

===Television===
Television in Croatia was first introduced in 1956. As of 2012 there are 10 nationwide and 21 regional DVB-T (Digital Video Broadcasting – Terrestrial) television channels, and more than 30 other channels either produced in the Republic of Croatia or produced for the Croatian market and broadcast via IPTV (Internet Protocol television), cable or satellite television. The electronic communications market in Croatia is regulated by the Croatian Regulatory Authority for Network Industries (HAKOM), which issues broadcast licenses and monitors the market. The DVB-T and satellite transmission infrastructure is developed and maintained by the state-owned company Odašiljači i veze (OiV).

The first television signal broadcast in Croatia occurred in 1939 during the Zagreb Fair, where Philips showcased its television system. The first regular broadcasts started in 1956, when Television Zagreb was established as the first TV station in the Yugoslav Radio Television system. Color broadcasts began in 1972. Coverage and number of channels grew steadily, and by the 2000s there were four channels with nationwide coverage in Croatia. DVB-T signal broadcasts began in 2002, and in 2010 a full digital switchover was completed. During that period the IPTV, cable and satellite television markets grew considerably, and by 2011 only 60.7 percent of households received DVB-T television only; the remainder were subscribed to IPTV, cable and satellite TV in addition, or as the sole source of TV reception. As of January 2012 DVB-T is broadcast in three multiplexes, while the territory of Croatia is divided into nine main allotment regions and smaller local allotments corresponding to major cities. High-definition television (HDTV) is broadcast only through IPTV, although HDTV DVB-T test programming was broadcast from 2007 to 2011. A DVB-T2 test broadcast was conducted in 2011.

As of November 2019 all national channels are transmitted via three DVB-T and one DVB-T2 (HEVC/H.265) MUXes. After June 2020 DVB-T MUXes will be switched off and all channels will be distributed via two DVB-T2 (HEVC/H.265) MUXes.

Television in Croatia, as all other media in the country are criticised for lack of balance of global issues and trends on one hand and national topics covered on the other. All major television networks in Croatia are generally thought to be under excessive influence of commercialism. State owned Croatian Radiotelevision is required to produce and broadcast educational programmes, documentaries, and programmes aimed at the diaspora and national minorities in Croatia. The television in Croatia is considered to be important in avenue for non-governmental organizations communicating their concerns to the public and to criticising the authorities. Television is the primary source of information for 57% of the population of Croatia.

==Food and drink==
===Cuisine===

Croatian cuisine is heterogeneous, and is therefore known as &quot;the cuisine of regions&quot;. Its modern roots date back to proto-Slavic and ancient periods and the differences in the selection of foodstuffs and forms of cooking are most notable between those on the mainland and those in coastal regions. Mainland cuisine is more characterized by the earlier proto-Slavic and the more recent contacts with the more famous gastronomic orders of today, Hungarian, Viennese and Turkish, while the coastal region bears the influences of the Greek, Roman and Illyrian, as well as of the later Mediterranean cuisine, including Italian and French.

A large body of books bears witness to the high level of gastronomic culture in Croatia, which in European terms dealt with food in the distant past, such as the Gazophylacium by Belostenec, a Latin-Kajkavian dictionary dating from 1740 that preceded a similar French dictionary. There is also Beletristic literature by Marulić, Hektorović, Držić and other writers, down to the work written by Ivan Bierling in 1813 containing recipes for the preparation of 554 various dishes (translated from the German original), and which is considered to be the first Croatian cookbook.

===Wine===


Croatian wine (, pl. ) has a history dating back to the Ancient Greek settlers, and their wine production on the southern Dalmatian islands of Vis, Hvar and Korčula some 2,500 years ago.&lt; Like other Old World wine producers, many traditional grape varieties still survive in Croatia, perfectly suited to their local wine hills. Modern wine-production methods have taken over in the larger wineries and EU-style wine regulations
 have been adopted, guaranteeing the quality of the wine.

There are currently over 300 geographically defined wine regions and a strict classification system to ensure quality and origin. The majority of Croatian wine is white, with most of the remainder being red and only a small percentage being rosé wines. In 2014, Croatia ranked 32nd in wine production by country with an estimated 45,272 tonnes.

Wine is a popular drink in Croatia, and locals traditionally like to drink wine with their meals. Quite often, the wine is diluted with either still or sparkling water—producing a drinks known as (a combination of white wine and carbonated water) and (a combination of red wine and still water).

=== Coffee ===
Drinking coffee is a ritual and a mean of socialising for Croatians. If they want to socialise with someone, they invite this person for a coffee. This is the reason why in Croatian towns coffee bar terraces can always be seen crawling with locals drinking their cappuccino and hanging out. Average coffee drinking time among Croatians tends to extend to between 40 and 45 minutes. According to the research done by Gfk Agency, 80% of Croatians older than 15 drink coffee on a daily basis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 44% of Croatian citizens reported that they miss drinking coffee in their caffe bars. Among Dalmatians, 65% reported that the first thing they will do when the lockdown ends is go to their coffee bar and order coffee. In Croatian culture, the person who invites for a coffee usually pays the bill. Exception is if another person wants to make a nice gesture and pays instead.

<text>Tiksi (; , &quot;Tiksii&quot; – lit. &quot;a moorage place&quot;) is an urban locality (an urban-type settlement) and the administrative center of Bulunsky District in the Sakha Republic, Russia, located on the shore of the Buor-Khaya Gulf of the Laptev Sea, southeast of the delta of the Lena River. As of the 2010 census, its population was 5,063.

==History==

In August 1901, Russian Arctic ship &quot;Zarya&quot; headed across the Laptev Sea, searching for the legendary Sannikov Land but was soon blocked by floating drift ice in the New Siberian Islands. During 1902, the attempts to reach Sannikov Land continued while &quot;Zarya&quot; was trapped in fast ice.

Leaving the ship, Russian Arctic explorer Baron Eduard Toll and three companions vanished forever in November 1902 while traveling away from Bennett Island towards the south on loose ice floes. &quot;Zarya&quot; was finally moored close to Brusneva Island in the Tiksi Bay, never to leave the place again. The remaining members of the expedition returned to Saint Petersburg, while Captain Fyodor Matisen went to Yakutsk.

Modern Tiksi was founded in 1933; urban-type settlement status was granted to it in 1939. During the Cold War, Tiksi saw military construction projects at Tiksi North and Tiksi West airfields. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Tiksi&#x27;s population has declined markedly and many of its apartment blocks have been abandoned. Despite its rapid population decline, it remains the world&#x27;s most northerly settlement with a population of over 4,000.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, the urban-type settlement of Tiksi serves as the administrative center of Bulunsky District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Bulunsky District as the Settlement of Tiksi. As a municipal division, the Settlement of Tiksi is incorporated within Bulunsky Municipal District as Tiksi Urban Settlement.

==Economy==
===Transportation===
Tiksi serves as one of the principal ports for accessing the Laptev Sea. It is served by the Tiksi Airport, which was shut down by the Defense Ministry on October 1, 2012 except for helicopters. Tiksi was connected only by helicopter flights and winter roads. The closure was harshly criticized by Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. Following an agreement between the Defense Ministry and the Government of the Sakha Republic in April 2013, the airfield re-opened to passenger traffic in June 2013. In December 2013, President Vladimir Putin announced that the Tiksi airport would be &quot;rehabilitated&quot; along with others beyond the Arctic Circle.

Since June 2023, the port of Tiksi has been opened to foreign ships.

The Lena River is navigable in the summer months. There is infrequent passenger navigation from Yakutsk.

==Climate==
Tiksi has a tundra climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;). Winter averages and extremes are less severe than the subarctic region further south, but the winter length is longer courtesy of the higher latitude. The very short summers are generally cooler than inland regions (although in 1991 a temperature as high as was reported) and see rainfall on most days. The polar night lasts from November 19 to January 24, and the period with continuous daylight, the midnight sun, lasts a bit longer, from May 11 to August 3.

The growing season in Tiksi lasts for 74 days usually from around June 23 to September 5.

<text>Al-Khisas (), also known as Khisas or Khissas, was a Palestinian Arab village in the Safad Subdistrict in Mandatory Palestine. It was located northeast of Safed on a natural terrace about wide that formed when Lake al-Hula receded. To the west of the village was a valley known as Wadi al-Hasibani through which ran the Hasbani River.

During the 1948 Palestine war, and as part of the Nakba, the village was attacked by the Palmach in a punitive raid and 10-15 of its residents were massacred. The village was subsequently depopulated and destroyed by Israeli forces. Today the Israeli kibbutz of HaGoshrim exists on the villages former lands.

==History==
The Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi described al-Khisas as falling within the administrative jurisdiction of Banias in Syria.
===Ottoman era===
Evidence of the long history of habitation in the village includes the nearby shrine of a local sage known as al-Shaykh &#x27;Ali and the presence of rock-hewn tombs. Under the Ottoman Empire, al-Khisas was administered as part of a sanjak in the vilayet of Damascus, and was later redesignated a part the vilayet of Sidon (renamed the vilayet of Beirut).

===British Mandate===
In 1917, al-Khisas lay north of the Sykes Picot line, a straight line between the midpoint of the Sea of Galilee and Nahariya in the area to be incorporated under a French sphere of influence. The Syria-Lebanon-Palestine boundary was a product of the post-World War I Anglo-French partition of Ottoman Syria. British forces had advanced to a position at Tel Hazor against Turkish troops in 1918 and wished to incorporate all the sources of the river Jordan within the boundaries of British controlled Palestine. Due to the French inability to establish administrative control, the frontier between Syria and Palestine became &#x27;fluid&#x27;. The international boundary between Palestine and Syria was finally set by joint agreement between Great Britain and France in 1923 in conjunction with the Treaty of Lausanne, after Britain had been given a League of Nations Mandate for Palestine in 1922; thus, al-Khisas came under British jurisdiction.

In the 1931 census of Palestine the population of Khisas was 386, all Muslims, in a total of 73 houses.

===1948 Palestine war and aftermath===

Al-Khisas had been selected, along with Al-Na&#x27;ima and Jahula, by the Palmach as a target for a Haganah operation which was then cancelled before it was undertaken. Leaflets was distributed in villages on Palestine&#x27;s border that warned the population not to engage in combat:

:&quot;If the war will be taken to your place, it will cause massive expulsion of the villagers, with their wives and their children. Those of you who do not wish to come to such a fate, I will tell them: in this war there will be merciless killing, no compassion. If you are not participating in this war, you will not have to leave your houses and villages.&quot;

====Al-Khisas massacre====
On the night of 18–19 December 1947, the Palmach conducted a massacre in al-Khisas with orders calling for &quot;hitting adult [or the adult] males&quot; and &quot;killing adult [or the adult] males in the palace of the Emir Faur&quot;, which was thought to hide a man responsible for shooting a resident of kibbutz Ma&#x27;ayan Baruch in revenge for the shooting of a Palestinian a few days earlier. They blew up Faur&#x27;s house and a neighbouring house, killing many occupants including women and children. The number of villagers killed is estimated at 10-15, including 5 children. Following the attack a large number of al-Khisas&#x27; residents fled their homes, becoming a part of the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight.

Local Jewish leaders and Arab affairs experts had tried to prevent the attack, but had been overridden by Yigal Allon. Afterwards the Political Department of the Jewish Agency criticized the attack and Yosef Sapir of the Defence Committee called for the punishment of those responsible, but no action was taken. David Ben-Gurion issued a denial that the raid had been authorised and issued a public apology, but it was later included by him in a list of successful operations. The Yishuv held a meeting on 1–2 January to discuss the policy of reprisal operations, the outcome of which was a formulation of guidelines by the Jewish High Command for the conduct and execution of retaliatory raids.

====Depopulation and destruction====

The first wave of villagers left al-Khisas after the 18 December 1947 attack, forming a part of the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight. Although an estimated 50-55 villagers remained in their homes and maintained good relations with neighboring Jewish settlements, they were eventually evicted on the night of 5–6 June 1949 as part of the 1949–1956 Palestinian expulsions. The villagers were forced into trucks and transported to the village of &#x27;Akbara, south of Safad. Those expelled remained at &#x27;Akbara for 18 years until agreeing to resettlement in Wadi Hamam.

On September 26, 1948, kibbutz HaGoshrim was established a few hundred meters south of the village, on the village&#x27;s lands. The kibbutz opened a hotel in the manor house of Emir Faour.

<text>During the European Middle Ages, a charge often meant an underage person placed under the supervision of a nobleman. Charges were the responsibility of the nobleman they were charged to, and they were usually expected to be treated as guests or a member of the household. Charges were at times used more or less openly as hostages, in order to keep their parents in line.

Today, the word is still used to mean anyone that a person is responsible for, such as a parent or chaperone&#x27;s children, a supervisor&#x27;s employees, a teacher&#x27;s students, or a nurse or doctor&#x27;s patients.

<text>A charge is an offensive maneuver in battle in which combatants advance towards their enemy at their best speed in an attempt to engage in a decisive close combat. The charge is the dominant shock attack and has been the key tactic and decisive moment of many battles throughout history. Modern charges usually involve small groups of fireteams equipped with weapons with a high rate of fire and striking against individual defensive positions (such as a concertainer or bunker), instead of large groups of combatants charging another group or a fortified line.

== Ancient charges ==
It may be assumed that the charge was used in prehistoric warfare, but clear evidence only comes with later literate societies. The tactics of the classical Greek phalanx included an ordered approach march, with a final charge to contact.

== Highland charge ==

In response to the introduction of firearms, Irish and Scottish troops at the end of the 16th century developed a tactic that combined a volley of musketry with a transition to rapid hand-to-hand combat using melee weapons. Initially successful, it was countered by effective discipline and the development of defensive bayonet tactics.

== Banzai charge ==

A term used by the Allied forces to refer to Japanese human wave attacks and swarming staged by infantry units armed with bayonets and swords. This term came from the Japanese battle cry &quot;Tennōheika Banzai&quot; (天皇陛下万歳, &quot;Long live His Majesty the Emperor&quot;), shortened to banzai, specifically referring to a tactic used by the Imperial Japanese Army during the Pacific War.

== Bayonet charge ==

The development of the bayonet in the late 17th century led to the bayonet charge becoming the main infantry charge tactic through the 18th and 19th centuries and well into the first half of the 20th century. As early as the 19th century, tactical scholars were already noting that most bayonet charges did not result in close combat. Instead, one side usually fled before actual bayonet fighting ensued. The act of fixing bayonets has been held to be primarily connected to morale, the making of a clear signal to friend and foe of a willingness to kill at close quarters.

== Cavalry charges ==
The shock value of a charge attack has been especially exploited in cavalry tactics, both of armored knights and lighter mounted troops of both earlier and later eras. Historians such as John Keegan have shown that when correctly prepared against (such as by improvising fortifications) and, especially, by standing firm in face of the onslaught, cavalry charges often failed against infantry, with horses refusing to gallop into the dense mass of enemies, or the charging unit itself breaking up. However, when cavalry charges succeeded, it was usually due to the defending formation breaking up (often in fear) and scattering, to be hunted down by the enemy. While it was not recommended for a cavalry charge to continue against unbroken infantry, charges were still a viable danger to heavy infantry. Parthian lancers were noted to require significantly dense formations of Roman legionaries to stop, and Frankish knights were reported to be even harder to stop, if the writing of Anna Komnene is to be believed. However, only highly trained horses would voluntarily charge dense, unbroken enemy formations directly, and in order to be effective, a strong formation had to be kept – being the result of efficient training. Heavy cavalry lacking even a single part of this combination – composed of high morale, excellent training, quality equipment, individual prowess, and collective discipline of both the warrior &quot;and&quot; the mount – would suffer in a charge against unbroken heavy infantry, and only the very best heavy cavalrymen (e.g., knights and cataphracts) throughout history would own these in regards to their era and terrain.

=== European Middle Ages ===
The cavalry charge was a significant tactic in the Middle Ages. Although cavalry had charged before, a combination of the adoption of a frame saddle secured in place by a breast-band, stirrups and the technique of couching the lance under the arm delivered a hitherto unachievable ability to utilise the momentum of the horse and rider. These developments began in the 7th century but were not combined to full effect until the 11th century. The Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081) was an early instance of the familiar medieval cavalry charge; recorded to have a devastating effect by both Norman and Byzantine chroniclers. By the time of the First Crusade in the 1090s, the cavalry charge was being employed widely by European armies.

However, from the dawn of the Hundred Years&#x27; War onward, the use of professional pikemen and longbowmen with high morale and functional tactics meant that a knight would have to be cautious in a cavalry charge. Men wielding either pike or halberd in formation, with high morale, could stave off all but the best cavalry charges, whilst English archers with the longbow could unleash a torrent of arrows capable of wreaking havoc, though not necessarily a massacre, upon the heads of heavy infantry and cavalry in unsuitable terrain. It became increasingly common for knights to dismount and fight as elite heavy infantry, although some continued to stay mounted throughout combat. The use of cavalry for flanking manoeuvres became more useful, although some interpretations of the knightly ideal often led to reckless, undisciplined charges.

Cavalry could still charge dense heavy infantry formations head-on if the cavalrymen had a combination of certain traits. They had a high chance of success if they were in a formation, collectively disciplined, highly skilled, and equipped with the best arms and armour, as well as mounted upon horses trained to endure the physical and mental stresses of such charges. However, the majority of cavalry personnel lacked at least one of these traits, particularly discipline, formations, and horses trained for head-on charges. Thus, the use of the head-on cavalry charge declined, although Polish hussars, French cuirassiers, and Spanish and Portuguese conquistadores were still capable of succeeding in such charges, often due to their possession of the previously mentioned combination of the traits required for success in such endeavours.

=== Twentieth century ===

In the twentieth century, the cavalry charge was seldom used, though it enjoyed sporadic and occasional success.

Elements of the 7th Cavalry Regiment of the United States attacked Villista forces in the Battle of Guerrero on 29 March 1916. The battle was a victory for the Americans, occurring in desert terrain, at the Mexican town of Vicente Guerrero, Chihuahua.

One of the most successful offensive cavalry charges of the 20th century was not conducted by cavalry at all, but rather by mounted infantry, when on 31 October 1917, the Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade charged across two miles of open terrain in the face of Ottoman artillery and machine gun fire to successfully capture Beersheba in what would come to be known as the Battle of Beersheba.

On 23 September 1918, the Jodhpur Lancers and Mysore Lancers of the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade charged Turkish positions on horseback at Haifa. Together the two regiments captured 1,350 German and Ottoman prisoners, including two German officers, 35 Ottoman officers, 17 artillery guns including four guns, eight guns and four camel guns as well as a naval gun, and 11 machine guns. Their own casualties amounted to eight dead and 34 wounded. 60 horses were killed and another 83 injured.

On 16 May 1919, during the Third Anglo-Afghan War, the 1st King&#x27;s Dragoon Guards made the last recorded charge by a British horsed cavalry regiment at Dakka, a village in Afghan territory, north west of the Khyber Pass.

During the Spanish Civil War, there was a massive cavalry charge by a Francoist division during the Battle of Alfambra on 5 February 1938, the last great mounted charge in Western Europe.

Several attempted charges were made in World War II.
The Polish cavalry, in spite of being primarily trained to operate as rapid infantry and being better armed than regular Polish infantry (more anti-tank weapons and armored vehicles per capita) did execute up to 15 cavalry charges during the Invasion of Poland. The majority of the charges were successful and none were meant as a charge against armored vehicles. Some battles featured mutual charges by the Polish and German cavalry such as the Battle of Krasnobród (1939). The German cavalry scouts from 4th Light Division (Germany) charged the Polish infantry from 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade (Poland) and were countered by Polish tankettes moving from concealed positions at Zakliczyn.
On November 17, 1941, during the Battle of Moscow, the Soviet 44th Cavalry Division charged the German lines near Musino, west of the capital. The mounted Soviets were ravaged by German artillery, then by machine guns. The charge failed, and the Germans said they killed 2,000 cavalrymen without a single loss to themselves. On 24 August 1942, the defensive charge of the Savoia Cavalleria at Izbushensky against Russian lines near the Don River was successful. British and American cavalry units also made similar cavalry charges during World War II. (See 26th Cavalry Regiment). The last successful cavalry charge of World War II was executed during the Battle of Schoenfeld on March 1, 1945. The Polish cavalry, fighting on the Soviet side, overwhelmed the German artillery position and allowed for infantry and tanks to charge into the city. The cavalry sustained only seven dead, while 26 Polish tankmen and 124 infantrymen as well as around 500 German soldiers were killed.)

After World War II, the cavalry charge was clearly outdated and was no longer employed; this, however, did not stop modern troops from utilising horses for transport, and in countries with mounted police, similar (albeit unarmed) techniques to the cavalry charge are sometimes employed to fend off rioters and large crowds.

=== Twenty-first century ===

At the start of the war in Afghanistan by United States forces, there was a cavalry charge by a unit of Green Berets led by Captain Mark Nutsch, and their use of horses in the charge was made into a Hollywood movie, &quot;12 Strong&quot;. Across from the site of the former World Trade Center (1973–2001) there is a monument to the &#x27;horse soldiers&#x27; who took part in that daring cavalry charge.

== Age of firearms ==
In the age of firearms, the basic parameters are speed of advance against rate (or effectiveness) of fire. If the attackers advance at a more rapid rate than the defenders can kill or disable them then the attackers will reach the defenders (though not necessarily without being greatly weakened in numbers). There are many modifiers to this simple comparison – timing, covering fire, organization, formation and terrain, among others. A failed charge may leave the would-be attackers vulnerable to a counter-charge.

There has been a constant rise in an army&#x27;s rate of fire for the last 700 years or so, but while massed charges have been successfully broken they have also been victorious. It is only since the mid-19th century that straight charges have become less successful, especially since the introduction of the repeating rifles, machine guns, and breech-loading artillery. They are often still useful on a far smaller scale in confined areas where the enemy&#x27;s firepower cannot be brought to bear. Bayonet charges are still seen in the early 20th century, but are often limited to use against adversaries with inferior firepowers, when ammunition supply is scarce, or simply as a form of suicide attack to inflict fear on the enemy.

In modern times, melee charges are practically extinct outside of riot control and street fighting, with a few exceptions such as the bayonet charge at the Battle of Danny Boy, but military charging tactics mainly take place with armored fighting vehicles such as tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and armored cars. These ground combat vehicles can either advance directly with marching fire, or transport infantry attackers quickly into proximity with the target position in order to assault and capture it. Air assaults are also a frequently used tactic to insert special operation raids against high-value targets.

== Notable charges ==

* Battle of the Golden Spurs (July 11, 1302): The French cavalry, consisting of many nobles, was defeated in battle by heavily armed Flemish militiamen on foot. The cavalry charge was cited to be rash and premature with the battlefield&#x27;s many ditches and marshes blamed for the loss, and at a few points on the Flemish line the French horsemen did manage to break through before being surrounded and annihilated. However it also demonstrated that well-disciplined and heavily armed infantry could defeat cavalry charges, ending the perception that heavy cavalry was practically invincible against infantry. The Battle of the Golden Spurs had been seen as the first example of the gradual &quot;Infantry Revolution&quot; in Medieval warfare across Europe during the 14th century.

* Charge of the Light Brigade (October 25, 1854) at the Battle of Balaclava in the Crimean War. Due to faulty orders a tiny force of 670 British light cavalrymen charged an enemy force many times their size. They succeeded in breaking through as well as disengaging, but suffered extremely heavy casualties and achieved no important objectives. Extensively memorialised and the subject of several literary and cinematographic works.
* Pickett&#x27;s Charge (July 3, 1863) at the Battle of Gettysburg in the American Civil War. A mass infantry assault on the Union lines repulsed with substantial loss. Pickett&#x27;s Charge has become one of the central symbols of the literary and cultural movement known as the Lost Cause.
* Battle of Mars-la-Tour (August 16, 1870): &quot;Von Bredow&#x27;s Death Ride&quot;. Prussian heavy cavalry brigade overrun French infantry and artillery to reinforce left flank of Prussian Army, at the cost of half the brigade. One of the few notable examples of successful cavalry charges after the introduction of modern firearms. Its success won it renown among military historians, which created a myth to the effect that &quot;for some decades &#x27;Bredow&#x27;s achievement was the norm&#x27;,&quot; that cavalry could still play a decisive role in battle in a modern war between equally equipped forces, and so cavalry units continued to be part of the armed forces of major European powers for the next half century.

<text>Gerhard Johannes Paul Domagk (; 30 October 1895 – 24 April 1964) was a German pathologist and bacteriologist.

He is credited with the discovery of sulfonamidochrysoidine (KL730) as an antibiotic for which he received the 1939 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The drug became the first commercially available antibiotic and marketed under the brand name Prontosil. 

While working in the pathology department of the University of Münster, Domagk was invited to join the IG Farben branch at Elberfeld (later Wuppertal) in 1927. His duty was to test chemical compounds prepared at the IG Farben laboratory for potential drugs. A novel compound synthesised by Friedrich Mietzsch and Joseph Klarer, a benzene derivative of azo dye attached with sulphonamide group as a side chain was found to have antibacterial activity against human bacterium &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes.&quot; In 1935, Domagk&#x27;s only daughter, Hildegarde, injured herself and contracted a streptococcal infection. In a desperate attempt to save his daughter&#x27;s arm from amputation and her life, Domagk used the new compound that eventually cured the infection. Given the brand name Prontosil, the new drug became the first antibiotic commercially available for bacterial infections.

Domagk was chosen to receive the 1939 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine &quot;for the discovery of the antibacterial effects of prontosil,&quot; but the Nazi government prohibited him from receiving the award. In 1947, after the fall of Nazi Germany, he was officially given the Nobel diploma and delivered the Nobel lecture.

==Biography==
Domagk was born in Lagow, Brandenburg, German Empire (now Poland). His father Paul Richard Domagk was a school teacher. He had an elder brother Erich, who died in childhood, and a younger sister, Charlotte. When he was five, in 1900, his father was transferred to Sommerfeld (now Lubsko, Poland). He immediately entered the Bismarck School where he completed elementary education in 1910. Then, he attended Herzog-Heinrich School in Liegnitz where he completed secondary education in 1914.

Domagk entered the University of Kiel in 1914 to study medicine. As the First World War broke out, the university was closed and he returned to Sommerfeld. He joined the German Grenadier Regimen 7 as a volunteer along with 15 of his old school friends. In his first experience of war at Flanders in October 1914, he barely escaped death where 11 of his school friends were killed. He was transferred to eastern front in Poland in December 1914, where he was shot on the head. He was transported to Lichterfelde near Berlin where he recovered from the injury. There he was given a training as medical orderly. In May 1915, he rejoined the eastern front as a medic. He recalled the horrors and suffering, especially of infections, at the battlefields, saying &quot;There horrible impressions kept pursuing me during my whole life, and made me think how I could take measures against bacteria... I then swore, in case I would return to my home alive, to work and work to make a small contribution to solve that problem.&quot;

As the war ended in November 1918, Domagk resumed his medical course at Kiel. His doctoral thesis titled &quot;Beeinflussung der Kreatininausscheidung durch Muskelarbeit&quot; (&quot;Influence of Creatinine Excretion in the Urine through Muscular Activity&quot;) was supervised by Max Buerger and with that he earned his degree in 1921. Between 1922 and 1923, he worked as an assistant to Georg Hoppe-Seyler at Kiel.

In 1923, he met Walter Gross, the Director of the Institute of Pathology at the University of Greifswald, at the conference of German Society of Pathology in Leipzig. Gross was impressed with him and appointed him a junior doctor at Greifswald. He supported Domagk&#x27;s research on phagocytosis, an immune process discovered by Russian zoologist Elie Metchnikoff, so far as permitting excessive use of electricity, constant photographic lights, and free roaming of experimental mice, all of which angered the janitor. Domagk&#x27;s thesis &quot;Destroying infectious diseases through the reticuloendothelium and the development of amyloid&quot;, published in 1924 in &quot;Virchows Archiv für pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und für klinische Medizin&quot; (now &quot;Virchows Archiv&quot;) was assessed as a worthy criterion for promotion to a full professor. However, Gross was appointed to the University of Münster, and he invited Domagk to join him as a lecturer at his proposed Department of Experimental Pathology. 

In 1925, he married Gertrude Strube, at the time an advisor to the German Chamber of Commerce in Basel. Later they had three sons and a daughter.

At Münster, Domagk felt that the new department was not flourishing as he anticipated and was underpaid. The IG Farben branch at Elberfeld (later Wuppertal) noticed him and offered him to lead their institute of experimental pathology. When he informed of this opportunity to his university authority in July 1927, and that he would stay if at least he was given a position of associate professor; he never received a response. He took a sabbatical leave for two years without pay, and decided to accept IG Farben&#x27;s offer in 1929. However, another source states that he joined the IG Farben in 1927.

Domagk was appointed director of the Institute of Pathology and Bacteriology, started working at the IG Farben laboratories at Wuppertal where he continued the studies of Josef Klarer and Fritz Mietzsch, based on works by Paul Ehrlich, to use dyes, at that time a major product of the company, as antibiotics. He changed his focus to tuberculosis and chemotherapy. He remained in that position until his retirement in 1961.

Along with Albert Einstein, Domagk was one of the sponsors of the Peoples&#x27; World Convention (PWC), also known as Peoples&#x27; World Constituent Assembly (PWCA), which took place in 1950-51 at Palais Electoral, Geneva, Switzerland. 

Domagk died from a heart attack at his villa in the Black Forest village of Burgberg near Königsfeld, Schwarzwald.

==Achievements==
=== Prontosil ===
Domagk&#x27;s responsibility at IG Farben was to test the new compounds, chemical dyes, for antimicrobial activities. Werner Schulemann, Friedrich Mietzsch, Hans Mauss and Joseph Klarer were largely responsible for providing a continuous supply of chemicals to be screened. Since the end of the 19th century, azo dyes, developed and used for colouring textile and other materials, were found to have medicinal properties against infections. For example, German biologist Paul Ehrlich used methylene blue, a type of azo dye, to kill malarial parasites in experimental animals, and cured two persons from malaria in 1891. Later, Ehrlich and his students found that some azo dyes were effective against African sleeping sickness. In 1913, P. Eisenberg discovered that another azo dye, chrysoidine could kill bacteria and could be used as a disinfectant. Following such leads, IG Farben devoted to studying and chemically modifying azo dyes for potential medicines.

==== Development ====
In early 1930s, Mietzsch and Klarer synthesised a benzene derivative of azo dye, which was chemically related to (an analogue of) chrysoidine. The compound had an addition of sulphonamide group as a side chain, thus becoming sulfamidochrysoidine. They suspected that a unique chemical component of sulphonamide group in the new dye could be a possible drug candidate; as Mietzsch predicted: &quot;[The sulphonamide parts were] the right substituents in the right positions on the azo group.&quot; The compound was then labelled KL730 (KL for Klarer). IG Farben received a German patent for the new compound in 1932. 

The exact date of synthesis is unknown. An account that the IG Farben leader Heinrich Hörlein suggested the use of sulfur group to azo dyes &quot;some time in 1932&quot; may not be true, as IG Farben received the patent of the first modified sulfamidochrysoidine on 7 November 1931. The other related compound received patent in December 1932. Initial experiments in 1931 indicated poor antibacterial effect against bacterial cultures. It was not known at the time that the active component of Prontosil was the sulphonamide and not the azo group, as they expected. In addition, the sulphonamides by themselves were not antibacterials, but only became active drug after metabolism inside the body. This is why the first tests (&quot;in vitro&quot;) on bacterial cultures failed.

==== Discovery of antibacterial activity ====
In early 1931, Domagk immediately tested the compound in mice that were having bacterial infection, and found that it was effective against Gram-positive bacteria. He designated a code for the compound D 4145 (D for Domagk). He induced infection at the belly (peritonitis) of mice using clinical specimens (isolates) of &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;. In the first experiment, he infected 26 mice by injecting the bacteria, and he injected a single dose of Prontosil to 12 of the infected mice, while the rest 14 were simply kept infected (as controls) without Prontosil treatment. All the Prontosil-injected mice survived, meaning they were cured of the streptococcal infection, whereas the untreated 14 mice all died by the fourth day of experiment. There were several more experimental tests, and a clinical trial in which a boy was cured of streptococcal infection in 1933. In February 1935, Domagk reported his experiments in the journal &quot;Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift&quot; as &quot;Ein Beitrag zur Chemotherapie der bakteriellen Infektionen&quot; (&quot;A contribution to the chemotherapy of bacterial infections&quot;).

At the time, there was no medical cure for streptococcal infection, and infected body parts had to be surgically removed to prevent further spread of the infection. This is still in practice when the infection had caused severe tissue damage even after antibiotics are available. In a notable incidence, Domagk&#x27;s six-year-old daughter, Hildegarde, injured herself with a stitching needle while making Christmas decorations on 4 December 1935. She fell on the stairs and stabbed her hand with the needle, and the broken needle was stuck in her wrist. The needle was removed at a hospital. However, she developed severe inflammation and fever from the next day. As Domagk recounted:When the dressing was changed a few days later there was marked swelling of the hand, and despite removal of all the stitches the fever continued to rise rapidly. In spite of numerous incisions the inflammation phlegmon extended to the under-arm. A serious worsening of the general condition and dizziness occurred, so that we were gravely worried about the child. Since further surgical intervention was not possible, I asked permission of the treating surgeon to use Prontosil, after I had established by culture that streptococci were the cause of the illness. After making 14 incisions, the physician suggested that the only way to save Hildegarde was amputation of the arm. However, Hildegarde recovered following the Prontosil treatment and her arm was saved. 

By 1935, Mietzsch and Klarer had prepared two forms of the compound, one is poorly soluble in water while the other is highly soluble. The water-soluble compound was given a name Streptozon (specifically Streptozon S, for the soluble sodium salt) after the bacterium with which it was originally experimented, and the less water-soluble was called Prontosil (specifically Prontosil rubrum). Prontosil was used as the common name for both and the brand name of the drug after 1935. Domagk had used only the Streptozon type. He reported the development of the drug and his human application in article &quot;Chemotherapie der streptokokken-infektionen&quot; (&quot;Chemotherapy of streptococcus infection&quot;) in the October issue of &quot;Klinische Wochenschrift&quot; (later &quot;Journal of Molecular Medicine&quot;)&quot;.&quot;

==== Confirmation ====
The first independent research was done by English physician Leonard Colebrook at the Queen Charlotte&#x27;s Maternity Hospital in London. Immediately after reading Domagk&#x27;s paper, in 1935, Colebrook repeated the experiments on mice using both soluble Streptozon and the less soluble form and found that Streptozon was more effective but only in specific bacteria that caused puerperal fever. However, he found a serious side effect that the surviving mice developed severe kidney damages. This discouraged him from human clinical trials, but he encountered one woman who was terminally ill from puerperal fever. Without other options of treatment, he gave the Streptozon that cured the woman in a couple of days. He tested the drug again on another woman with the same result, to which he remarked: &quot;Almost at once there was a surprising and most gratifying change.&quot; With Méave Kenny, he treated 64 women and reported the experiments and clinical trials in 1936. The medical application was soon supported by other clinical cases and Prontosil became the major antibiotic for the next decade.

Sulfonamides had revolutionary antibacterial effectiveness for their time, surpassing phage therapy, but were later replaced by penicillin, which showed both better effects and fewer side effects (sulfonamides can cause kidney stones and changes in bone marrow). However, Domagk&#x27;s work on sulfonamides eventually led to the development of the antituberculosis drugs thiosemicarbazone and isoniazid, which helped to curb the epidemic of tuberculosis which swept Europe after World War II. Although Prontosil lost its popularity after the 1960s, its derivatives are continued to be used in several bacterial and viral infections, especially in the treatments of burns and urinary tract infections.

=== Zephirol ===
In 1932, Domagk discovered the potential use of benzyldimethyldodecylammonium chloride as a powerful antimicrobial agent. After a series of tests with different bacteria, he published in 1935 as a disinfectant, naming it Zephirol. Domagk explained how Zephirol applied to the skin, such as before wearing gloves during surgery, could prevent infection. It led to a successful marketing as a common disinfectant. This was the discovery of quats, chemicals that are later used in a variety of consumer applications including as general antimicrobials (such as detergents and disinfectants), fabric softeners, and hair conditioners. 

=== Cancer therapy ===
Since 1936, Domagk also focussed on cancer treatment. In 1956, he reported the successful development of an anticancer drug which he designated E-39 (E for ethylenimine quinones). He showed that the compound could destroy cancer cells such as Yoshida sarcoma, Ehrlich carcinoma and Crocker sarcoma of mice and the Walker carcinoma of rats. He was aware that precision drugs would be required to target specific cancers, as he remarked:In therapy we will have to be satisfied, for the present at least, with a certain equilibrium between body cell and tumorous cell, even if the tumor cannot be completely eliminated. We will be satisfied if we can slow down it growth, in order to preserve the life of a patient longer and under bearable conditions.Although the drug did not find way into prescription treatment of cancer, it was continued to be investigated and several related compounds are still under experimental studies.

== Nobel Prize and issues ==
In 1939, Domagk was selected by the Nobel Foundation to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of Prontosil as an antibiotic, the first commercially available drug effective against bacterial infections. However, the Nazi Germany banned him from attending the award ceremony. This was because Carl von Ossietzky, an outspoken anti-Nazi pacifist, had won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1935, which had angered the Nazi German government. Ossietzky was imprisoned and died in a concentration camp. In 1937 Adolf Hitler made an official decree that prohibited German nationals from accepting Nobel Prizes.

On 27 October 1939, Domagk received a telegram from the rector of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm that he was to receive the Nobel Prize. He informed the rector of the University of Münster, Walter Mevius, who immediately submitted a petition to the German authorities to allow Domagk to receive the award. Domagk himself wrote to the NSDAP Office of the Führer, Hitler&#x27;s headquarters, that should he be allowed to receive the award, he would donate 100,000 Deutsche Marks for the war cause. On 17 November, he was arrested by the Gestapo who detained him for a week. He was released when he was verified that he supported the German National Socialism and was politically loyal. However, he was informed to communicate with Karolinska Institute only through the government departments such as the Ministry of Education or Foreign Office, and forced to decline the award. It was officially announced in Berlin that Domagk had &quot;rather regretfully declined&quot; the award.

Two years after the end of World War II and the Nazi regime, the Nobel Foundation gave the Nobel medallion and a diploma to Domagk in 1947. However, the monetary prize was not given as it was already returned to the foundation.

== Awards and honours ==
Domagk was awarded the 1939 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. In the same year, Domagk was also awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh. In 1941 Domagk was awarded the &quot;Medaglia Paterno&quot; (Rome) by the Kingdom of Italy and also the Von-Klebelsberg-Medal and Prize by the Kingdom of Hungary. He became a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in 1942. 

After the war, in 1947, Domagk was finally able to receive his Nobel Prize, but not the monetary portion of the prize due to the time that had elapsed. In 1951, he was one of seven Nobel Laureates who attended the 1st Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting. He received the El Soleil del Perú in 1952, the Pour le mérite für Wissenschaften und Künste in 1952, the Spanish Civil de Sanidad in 1953, the del Lobertador from the Republic of Venezuela in 1957, the Medal of the Rising Sun 2nd Class from Japan in 1960, the Grand Cross with Star of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1955. In 1952, he was elected chairman of the German Society of Pathology.

Domagk became a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1959; his short biography was published by the Royal Society in 1964.

Domagkpark, a public park, and Domagkstraße, a road, in Munich are named after Domagk. In Münster, a research foundation called Krebsforschung Professor Dr. Gerhard Domagk (Cancer Research Professor Dr. Gerhard Domagk) was established in 1961, and Gerhard-Domagk-Institut für Pathologie (Gerhard Domagk Institute of Pathology) is created in the University of Münster.

<text>Sarah &quot;Sass&quot; Jordan (born 23 December 1962) is an English-born Canadian rock singer from Montreal, Quebec. Her first single, &quot;Tell Somebody,&quot; from her debut album of the same title won the Juno Award for Most Promising Female Vocalist in 1989. Since then, she has been nominated three more times for Juno Awards. Her album &quot;Rebel Moon Blues&quot; hit #5 on the Billboard Blues chart. Released 28 April 2023, her latest is a live album from 1994 when she toured with Taylor Hawkins on drums called Live in New York Ninety-Four.

==Early life==

Jordan was born in 1962, in Birmingham, England to French literary professor Albert Jordan and former English ballerina Jean Lanceman. When Jordan was three years old, her dad moved them from France to Montreal for a position as a professor at Concordia University. In 1986, Jordan made her recording debut on the Bündock album &quot;Mauve&quot; as co-lead vocalist on the song &quot;Come On (Baby Tonight)&quot;. She soon began working as a session vocalist for other Montreal-based acts, notably for The Box. Jordan appeared as a vocalist in the music video for The Box song &quot;Closer Together&quot;, although the vocals were recorded by Martine St. Clair. Local acts began recording songs written by Jordan, including the Canadian hit single &quot;Rain&quot; by Michael Breen, which was featured on his 1987 self-titled album. In her early teens, Jordan regularly sang and played guitar with a group of friends in Westmount Park. By the age of 16, Sass Jordan began performing with bands at clubs in downtown Montreal, eventually becoming a vocalist/bassist for high-profile local band The Pinups.

==Musical influences==
Jordan was first inspired to pursue music after hearing The Band&#x27;s 1969 track &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot; on the radio. Jordan&#x27;s parents only had classical music in the house, and she has described hearing The Band on the radio as a &quot;revelation.&quot; She has cited Rod Stewart, Judas Priest, Ozzy Osbourne, David Bowie, Tears For Fears, Anthrax and American soul singer Al Green as among her musical influences.


==Recording career==
Jordan&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Tell Somebody&quot;, was released in 1988 on Atlantic Records, featuring the Canadian chart hit singles &quot;Tell Somebody&quot;, &quot;Double Trouble&quot;, &quot;Stranger Than Paradise&quot;, and &quot;So Hard&quot;. &quot;They played the &quot;Tell Somebody&quot; video on Much Music a lot,&quot; said Jordan. &quot;I remember going in two weeks from relative obscurity to being recognized as the girl in the video.&quot; During the 1988–89 chart run of &quot;So Hard&quot;, Jordan was also represented on the Canadian charts with her remake of the 1965 R&amp;B classic &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, which had been recorded for the soundtrack of the film &quot;American Boyfriends&quot;. As a result of her quick rise to fame, Jordan relocated from Montreal to Los Angeles in January 1990 to try breaking into the American music market.

Jordan&#x27;s second album, &quot;Racine&quot;, was released in 1992 on MCA Records. Recorded in Los Angeles, Racine is Jordan&#x27;s highest-selling album, with global sales estimated at 450,000 copies, and yielded the Canadian hit singles &quot;Make You a Believer&quot;, &quot;I Want to Believe&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Remind Me&quot; and &quot;Goin’ Back Again&quot;. &quot;Make You a Believer&quot; and &quot;I Want to Believe&quot; were ranked on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Mainstream Rock chart. Racine has sold 100,000 copies in Canada.

In 1992, Jordan recorded the duet &quot;Trust in Me&quot; with Joe Cocker for the motion picture &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;, after star Kevin Costner heard Jordan on his car radio. The soundtrack album for &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; would sell in excess of 45 million copies worldwide.

In 1994, Sass Jordan released &quot;Rats&quot; which she has cited as her favorite album. Rats yielded Jordan&#x27;s first song on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot; with the single &quot;Sun&#x27;s Gonna Rise&quot;. However, &quot;Rats&quot; failed to build on the momentum of &quot;Racine&quot;, and Jordan subsequently was dropped from the MCA Records roster. Jordan then began recording for &quot;Aquarius Records&quot;, acquiescing to the label&#x27;s request for a more mainstream sound for the albums &quot;Present&quot; (1997) and &quot;Hot Gossip&quot; (2000). &quot;Those are probably my least favourite records,&quot; says Jordan. &quot;I think there are some great songs, I just don&#x27;t like the production at all.&quot;

Sass Jordan&#x27;s success as a judge on &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; encouraged her to return to recording in 2006, with the release of her album &quot;Get What You Give&quot;, recorded at the Nashville studio of Colin Linden, who served as producer. Guest artists on the album included bassist Garry Tallent (of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band), drummers Ken Coomer (Uncle Tupelo, Wilco) and Bryan Owings (Shelby Lynne), guitarist Audley Freed (The Black Crowes) and keyboardist Richard Bell (The Band, Janis Joplin).

In 2009, Jordan entrusted her husband Derek Sharp with producing her album &quot;From Dusk &#x27;til Dawn&quot;. The album was recorded in only three weeks and was mixed in Los Angeles. In discussing the songwriting for &quot;From Dusk ‘til Dawn&quot;, Jordan explained, &quot;I was thinking about how human beings seem to be more sensitive and worried about things from sunset to sunrise. When you&#x27;re alone is when the fear of death really hits you, and I was trying to write songs that were related to the fears of the middle of the night.&quot;

In 2011, Jordan recorded the studio project album &quot;S.U.N.: Something Unto Nothing&quot; featuring Brian Tichy and Michael Devin of Whitesnake, and Tommy Stewart. The album began when Jordan reunited with Tichy at his Santa Clarita home studio to write songs. &quot;Something Unto Nothing&quot; marked the first collaboration between Jordan and Tichy since &quot;Rats&quot;. &quot;Burned&quot; was the first song that Jordan and Tichy wrote together for the project, which soon evolved into a full album.

In 2017, 25 years after the release of &quot;Racine&quot;, Jordan recorded &quot;Racine Revisited&quot; featuring reimagined versions of the songs from the original 1992 album. &quot;We pushed the sound back to the Misty Mountain Hop days of the 1970s and made it as if we were actually recording back then,&quot; said Jordan. &quot;We would all live together in the studio and record live off the floor [without] Auto-Tune or click track or anything like that&quot;. Of the recording process, Sass Jordan said that &quot;Racine Revisited&quot; was &quot;the most fun I’ve had in a while making a record.&quot; &quot;Instead of taking Racine from 1992 to 2017, we went from 1992 to 1976&quot;.

In 2020, Sass Jordan released &quot;Rebel Moon Blues&quot;, her first blues album. &quot;Rebel Moon Blues&quot; features covers of blues classics, as well as the original &quot;The Key&quot;. In discussing &quot;The Key&quot; on SXMCanadaNow, Jordan said, &quot;That song was written about three weeks before we went into recording. Derek and I realized we should have at least one song that we wrote together on here, and so we came up with &quot;The Key&quot;. The whole song came together in an hour. When it&#x27;s meant to happen it really just flows out.&quot; &quot;Rebel Moon Blues&quot; was critically acclaimed upon release, with American Blues Scene writing, &quot;After three decades in the business, many singers lose that certain something that may have launched their career. Not so with Sass Jordan. Not only is her voice as muscular as ever, I think, like fine wine, it&#x27;s improved over the years.&quot; The album debuted at #5 on the Billboard Blues Album Chart.

Her second blues album called Bitches Blues, featuring the song Still Alive and Well, was released on 3 June 2022.

In April 2023, Sass Jordan&#x27;s much anticipated live album featuring Taylor Hawkins on drums in 1994 will be available on streaming and vinyl pre-orders. The album was called Live in New York Ninety-Four. The first single was High Road Easy Live.

==Other projects==

Sass Jordan has enjoyed a successful acting career in theatre and television. Jordan played the lead role of Janis Joplin in the off-Broadway hit &quot;Love, Janis&quot; in 2001, and performed in the Toronto and Winnipeg productions of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;. Jordan guest starred in the 1990s family-drama &quot;Sisters&quot;, which was her last television experience before joining &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;.

Sass Jordan served as a judge on all six seasons of &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;, beginning in 2003. In a bizarre twist of fate, Jordan had met &quot;Idol&quot; creator Simon Fuller twenty years before the launch of &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; when Fuller was managing English bands touring in Montreal. In 1981, a band that Fuller was managing had run out of money, and he ended up living in Sass Jordan&#x27;s basement for two weeks. The &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; participants who Jordan is most fond of are Carly Rae Jepsen and Melissa O&#x27;Neil.

In 2019, Sass Jordan joined &quot;A Bowie Celebration: The David Bowie Alumni Tour&quot;. Led by Mike Garson, Bowie&#x27;s keyboard player for forty years, the one-of-a-kind roving tribute to David Bowie features Bowie&#x27;s past bandmates and has received wide acclaim. In discussing her involvement with the band, Jordan said, &quot;I am extremely honored to be part of a show that celebrates the astonishing legacy of one of my ultimate idols, David Bowie, as well as getting to play with some of the master musicians from his bands. Bowie is one of the reasons I wanted to be a performer, and doing this tour is like playing a love letter to his memory every night!&quot;. Sass Jordan&#x27;s first ever concert was David Bowie on his Diamond Dogs Tour.

Sass Jordan has ventured into the world of alcohol and spirits, with Rebel Moon Whiskey (a blended Canadian whisky by Dixon Distilleries) and Kick Ass Sass Wine (from Vineland Estates Winery in the Niagara Region). In discussing her branded lines of alcohol, Jordan said, &quot;I am fascinated with the use of alcohol throughout history, in medicinal as well as gourmet types of approaches. It&#x27;s also a wonderful companion to celebration, and I&#x27;m all about celebration - through music, through food, through dance, and art of all kinds!&quot;

==Personal life==

In the early 1990s, Sass Jordan toured with 22-year-old Taylor Hawkins, who later gained fame as the drummer of Foo Fighters. Of Jordan, Hawkins has said, &quot;Sass taught me how to be in a rock and roll band and gave me my first rock and roll check.&quot; On 9 July 2015, Jordan was reunited with Hawkins when she joined Foo Fighters on stage in Toronto to cover &quot;Stay With Me&quot; by the Faces. Before the performance, Dave Grohl said, &quot;If it weren&#x27;t for Sass Jordan, Taylor Hawkins wouldn&#x27;t be in Foo Fighters.&quot; Jordan is married to musician Derek Sharp, and they have one daughter.

==Honours==
Jordan was the recipient of the Juno award for Most Promising Female Vocalist of the Year in 1989, and was nominated for Best Female Vocalist in 1990, 1993, and 1995.

Billboard magazine listed Sass Jordan as the Top Female Rock Artist of the Year in 1992.

In 2012, Jordan was appointed honorary colonel of 417 Combat Support Squadron, an appointment she held until Glen Suitor&#x27;s appointment in August 2016.

<text>Carrollton is a locality in eastern Carroll County, Maryland, United States.

It is not to be confused with Carrollton Manor in Frederick County, from which Charles Carroll of Carrollton, a prominent signer of the Declaration of Independence, took his name. It also should not be confused with New Carrollton, Maryland, which is located in Prince George&#x27;s County. New Carrollton, a Washington suburb created in the 1950s, was originally also called &quot;Carrollton, Maryland,&quot; until the name was changed in 1966.

Carrollton is located by the confluence of the Patapsco River&#x27;s North and West Branches, around where Carrollton Road intersects Reese Road.
