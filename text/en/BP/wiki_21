<text>Viscount Bangor, of Castle Ward, in County Down, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland.

==History==

The title was created in January 1781 for Bernard Ward, 1st Baron Bangor, who had previously represented County Down in the Irish House of Commons. He had already been created Baron Bangor, of Castle Ward in the County of Down, in May 1770, also in the Peerage of Ireland.

His son, the second Viscount, sat as a member of the Irish Parliament for Bangor and was declared insane. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Viscount. His eldest son, the fourth Viscount, sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1855 to 1881. His younger brother, the fifth Viscount, was an Irish Representative Peer from 1886 to 1911. His son, the sixth Viscount, was an Irish Representative Peer between 1913 and 1950 and also sat in the Senate of Northern Ireland from 1921 to 1950 and served as its Speaker from 1930 to 1950. , the titles are held by his grandson, the eighth Viscount, who succeeded his father, journalist Edward Ward, in 1993.

Nicholas Ward, great-grandfather of the first Viscount, and Michael Ward, father of the first Viscount, both represented County Down in the Irish House of Commons. Robert Ward, uncle of Nicholas Ward, was created a Baronet in 1682 (see Ward Baronets). The Hon. Edward Ward, second son of the first Viscount, was also a member of the Irish Parliament for County Down. Edward Wolstenholme Ward, a son of John Petty Ward, younger brother of the third Viscount, sat in the New South Wales Legislative Council. The actress Lalla Ward is the daughter of the seventh Viscount and the former wife of both Professor Richard Dawkins and her Doctor Who co-star Tom Baker

The family seat is Castle Ward, near Strangford, County Down.

<doc id="470204" wikidata="Q559833" url="?curid=470204" title="Kostas Karyotakis">
<text>Kostas Karyotakis (; ; 11 November (OS October 30), 1896 – 20 July 1928) is considered one of the most representative Greek poets of the 1920s and one of the first poets to use iconoclastic themes in Greece.

His poetry conveys a great deal of nature, imagery and traces of expressionism and surrealism. He also belongs to the Greek Lost Generation movement. The majority of Karyotakis&#x27; contemporaries viewed him in a dim light throughout his lifetime without a pragmatic accountability for their contemptuous views; for after his suicide, the majority began to revert to the view that he was indeed a great poet. He had a significant, almost disproportionately progressive influence on later Greek poets.

== Biography ==
Karyotakis gave existential depth as well as a tragic dimension to the emotional nuances and melancholic tones of the neo-Symbolist and neo-Romantic poetry of the time. With a rare clarity of spirit and penetrating vision, he captures and conveys with poetic daring the climate of dissolution and the impasses of his generation, as well as the traumas of his own inner spiritual world.

===Early life===

Karyotakis was born in Tripoli, Greece, his father&#x27;s occupation as a county engineer resulted in his early childhood and teenage years being spent in various places, following his family&#x27;s successive moves around the Greek cities, including Argostoli, Lefkada, Larisa, Kalamata, Athens and Chania. He started publishing poetry in various magazines for children in 1912. It is solely rife speculation that he had felt deeply betrayed that a girl he had cared for in Hania in 1913 had married and sent him into melancholy.

After receiving his degree from the Athens School of Law and Political Sciences, in 1917, he did not pursue a career as a lawyer. Karyotakis became a clerk in the Prefecture of Thessaloniki. However, he greatly disliked his work and could not tolerate the bureaucracy of the state, which he wrote about often in his poems. His prose piece &quot;Catharsis&quot; (&#x27;purification&#x27;) is characteristic of this. For this reason, he would often be removed from his posts and transferred to other locations in Greece. During these removals, he became familiar with the boredom and misery of the country during World War I.
===Adulthood and career===
In February 1919 he published his first collection of poetry: &quot;The Pain of People and of Things&quot; (), which was largely ignored or badly reviewed by the critics. In the same year, he published, with his friend Agis Levendis, a satirical review, called &quot;The Leg&quot;, which, despite its success, was banned by the police after the sixth issue. In 1921 he published his second collection called &quot;Nepenthe&quot; () and also wrote a musical revue, &quot;Pell-Mell&quot; (). In 1922 he began having an affair with the poet Maria Polydouri who was a colleague of his at the Prefecture of Attica. In 1923 he wrote a poem called &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; (), which was published under the title &quot;Song of Madness&quot; and gave rise to speculation that he may have been suffering from syphilis, which before 1945 was considered a chronic illness with no proven cure for it.

George Skouras, a physician of the poet, wrote: &quot;He was sick, he was syphilitic&quot; and George Savidis (1929–1999), professor of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, who possessed the largest archive about Greek poets, revealed that Karyotakis was syphilitic, and that his brother, Thanasis Karyotakis, thought the disease to be a disgrace to the family. In 1924 he traveled abroad, visiting Italy and Germany. In December 1927 he published his last collection of poetry: &quot;Elegy and Satires&quot; (). In February 1928, Karyotakis was transferred to Patras although soon afterwards he spent a month on leave in Paris and in June 1928 he was sent yet again to Preveza by ship.
==Suicide==

Karyotakis lived in Preveza only for 33 days, until his suicide there on 21 July 1928 at age 31. His work was in the Prefecture of Preveza, in the Palios mansion, 10 Speliadou Street, as a lawyer for control of land donations from the State to refugees from the Asia Minor War of 1922. From Preveza he sent desperate letters to friends and relatives describing the misery he felt in the town. His family offered to support him for an indefinite stay in Paris, but he refused knowing what a monetary sacrifice like this would entail for them. His angst is felt in the poem &quot;Preveza&quot; () which he wrote shortly before his suicide. The poem displays an insistent, lilting anaphora on the word Death, which stands at the beginning of several lines and sentences.

It is shot through with an intense awareness of the gallows, in the tiny mediocrity of life as Karyotakis felt it, mortality is measured against insignificant, black, pecking birds, or the town policeman checking a disputed weight, or identified with futile street names (boasting the date of battles), or the brass band on Sunday, a trifling sum of cash in a bank book, the flowers on a balcony, a teacher reading his newspaper, the prefect coming in by ferry: &quot;If only,&quot; mutters the last of these six symmetrical quatrains, &quot;one of those men would fall dead out of disgust&quot;.

On 19 July 1928, Karyotakis went to Monolithi beach and kept trying to drown in the sea for ten hours, but failed in his attempt, because he was an avid swimmer as he himself wrote in his suicide note. In the subsequent morning, he returned home and left again to purchase a revolver and went to a little café in the place Vryssoula (near today&#x27;s Hotel Zikas). After smoking for a few hours, and drinking cherry juice, he left 75 drachmas as a gratuity, while the cost of the drink was 5 drachmas, he went to Agios Spyridon, where, under a eucalyptus tree, he shot himself through the heart. His suicide letter was found in his pocket:

One of his most famous poems is &quot;Preveza&quot;, about the place where he committed suicide.
:&quot;Death is the bullies bashing&quot;
:&quot;against the black walls and roof tiling,&quot;
:&quot;death is the women being loved&quot;
:&quot;as if onion peeling.&quot;

:&quot;Death the squalid, unimportant streets&quot;
:&quot;with their glamorous and pompous names,&quot;
:&quot;the olive-grove, the surrounding sea, and even&quot;
:&quot;the sun, death among all other deaths.&quot;

:&quot;If at least, among these people,&quot;
:&quot;one would die of sheer disgust&quot;
:&quot;silent, bereaved, with humble manners,&quot; 
:&quot;at the funeral we&#x27;d all have fun.&quot;

<doc id="470209" wikidata="Q594324" url="?curid=470209" title="General Inter-ORB Protocol">
<text>In distributed computing, General Inter-ORB Protocol (GIOP) is the message protocol by which object request brokers (ORBs) communicate in CORBA. Standards associated with the protocol are maintained by the Object Management Group (OMG). The current version of GIOP is 2.0.2. The GIOP architecture provides several concrete protocols, including:

# Internet InterORB Protocol (IIOP) — The Internet Inter-Orb Protocol is an implementation of the GIOP for use over the Internet, and provides a mapping between GIOP messages and the TCP/IP layer.
# SSL InterORB Protocol (SSLIOP) — SSLIOP is IIOP over SSL, providing encryption and authentication.
# HyperText InterORB Protocol (HTIOP) — HTIOP is IIOP over HTTP, providing transparent proxy bypassing.
# Zipped InterORB Protocol (ZIOP) — A zipped version of GIOP that reduces the bandwidth usage

== Environment Specific Inter-ORB Protocols ==
As an alternative to GIOP, CORBA includes the concept of an Environment Specific Inter-ORB Protocol (ESIOP). While GIOP is defined to meet general-purpose needs of most CORBA implementations, an ESIOP attempts to address special requirements. For example, an ESIOP might use an alternative protocol encoding to improve efficiency over networks with limited bandwidth or high latency. ESIOPs can also be used to layer CORBA on top of some non-CORBA technology stack, such as Distributed Computing Environment (DCE).

DCE Common Inter-ORB Protocol (DCE-CIOP) is an ESIOP for use in DCE. It maps CORBA to DCE RPC and CDR (Command Data Representation). DCE-CIOP is defined in chapter 16 of the CORBA 2.6.1 standard.

==Messages==
The General Inter-ORB Protocol (GIOP) is the message protocol used by object request brokers (ORBs) to communicate in CORBA-based distributed computing systems. GIOP 2.0.2 is the current version of this protocol, and it provides a number of concrete protocols such as IIOP, SSLIOP, HTIOP, and ZIOP. IIOP is a mapping of GIOP messages to the TCP/IP layer for use over the Internet, while SSLIOP provides encryption and authentication. HTIOP, on the other hand, enables transparent proxy bypassing by using IIOP over HTTP. Finally, ZIOP is a compressed version of GIOP that minimizes bandwidth usage. In addition to these protocols, CORBA also includes the concept of an Environment Specific Inter-ORB Protocol (ESIOP) to address specific requirements. An ESIOP can use an alternative protocol encoding to improve efficiency over networks with limited bandwidth or high latency, or can be used to layer CORBA on top of non-CORBA technologies such as DCE. DCE Common Inter-ORB Protocol (DCE-CIOP) is an ESIOP that maps CORBA to DCE RPC and CDR.

<doc id="470210" wikidata="Q7935744" url="?curid=470210" title="Viscount Doneraile">
<text>Viscount Doneraile () is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of Ireland, both times for members of the St Leger family.

It was first created in 1703 for Arthur St Leger, along with the subsidiary title of Baron Kilmayden, also in the Peerage of Ireland. This creation became extinct in 1767 upon the death of the fourth Viscount. His daughter, Elizabeth, had a son named St Leger Aldworth, who succeeded to the Doneraile estates and assumed the surname of St Leger in lieu of his patronymic. He notably represented Doneraile in the Irish Parliament from 1749 to 1776. The latter year, he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Doneraile. In 1785, the viscountcy was revived and he was created Viscount Doneraile, also in the Peerage of Ireland.

His grandson, the third Viscount, sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1830 to 1854. His son, the fourth Viscount, was an Irish Representative Peer between 1855 and 1887. He was succeeded by his second cousin, the fifth Viscount. His son, the sixth Viscount, served as Mayor of the City of Westminster.

On the death of his younger brother, the seventh Viscount, this line of the family failed, and he was succeeded by his second cousin once removed, the eighth Viscount. , the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the tenth Viscount, who succeeded his father in 1983. He lives in California.
The family seat was Doneraile Court, near Mallow, County Cork.

<text>The Arameans, or Aramaeans (; ; , , ), were a tribal Semitic people in the ancient Near East, first documented in historical sources from the late 12th century BC. Their homeland, often referred to as the land of Aram, originally covered central regions of modern Syria.

The Arameans were not a single nation or group; rather, Aram was a region with local centers of power spread throughout the Levant. That makes it almost impossible to establish a coherent ethnic category of &quot;Aramean&quot; based on extra-linguistic identity markers such as material culture, lifestyle or religion. The people of Aram were called “Arameans” in Assyrian texts and in the Hebrew Bible, but the terms “Aramean” and “Aram” were never used by later Aramean dynasts to refer to themselves or their country, with the exception of the king of Aram-Damascus since his kingdom was also called Aram. &quot;Arameans&quot; is merely an appellation of the geographical term Aram given to 1st-millennium BC inhabitants of Syria. 

At the beginning of the 1st millennium BCE, several Aramean-ruled city-states were established throughout the ancient Near East. The most notable was Aram-Damascus which reached its height in the second half of the 9th century BCE during the reign of King Hazael. During the 8th century BC, local Aramaean city-states were gradually conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire. The policy of population displacement and relocation that was applied throughout Assyrian domains also affected Arameans, many of whom were resettled by Assyrian authorities. That caused a wider dispersion of Aramean communities throughout various regions of the Near East, and the range of Aramaic also widened. It gained significance and eventually became the common language of public life and administration, particularly during the periods of the Neo-Babylonian Empire (612–539 BCE) and the Achaemenid Empire (539–330 BCE).

Before Christianity, Aramaic-speaking communities had undergone considerable Hellenization and Romanization in the Near East. Thus, their integration into the Greek-speaking world had begun a long time before Christianity became established. Some scholars suggest that Arameans who accepted Christianity were referred to as Syrians by the Greeks. The early Muslim conquests in the 7th century were followed by the Islamization and the gradual Arabization of Aramaic-speaking communities throughout the Near East. That ultimately resulted in their fragmentation and acculturation. Today, their cultural and linguistic heritage continues to be recognized by some Syriac-Christian or Neo-Aramaic speaking groups, such as the Maronites and the Aramean inhabitants of Maaloula and Jubb’adin near Damascus in Syria.

== Etymology ==
The toponym &quot;A-ra-mu&quot; appears in an inscription at the East Semitic-speaking kingdom of Ebla listing geographical names, and the term &quot;Armi&quot;, the Eblaite term for nearby Idlib, occurs frequently in the Ebla tablets (c. 2300 BCE). One of the annals of Naram-Sin of Akkad (c. 2250 BCE) mentions that he captured &quot;Dubul, the ensí of &quot;A-ra-me&quot;&quot; (&quot;Arame&quot; is seemingly a genitive form), in the course of a campaign against Simurrum in the northern mountains. Other early references to a place or people of &quot;Aram&quot; have appeared at the archives of Mari (c. 1900 BCE) and at Ugarit (c. 1300 BCE). There is no consensus on the origin and meaning of the word &quot;Aram&quot;, one of the most accepted suggestions being that it is derived from a Semitic root &quot;rwm&quot;, &quot;to be high&quot;. Newer suggestions interprets it as a broken plural meaning &quot;white antelopes&quot; or &quot;white bulls&quot;. However, there are no historical, archaeological or linguistic evidences that those early uses of the terms &quot;Aramu&quot;, &quot;Armi&quot; or &quot;Arame&quot; were actually referring to the Arameans; thus, it is believed to originally be a toponym without any ethnic connotations. The earliest undisputed historical attestation of Arameans as a people appears much later, in the inscriptions of Tiglath Pileser I (c. 1100 BCE).

==History==
===Origins===
Nomadic pastoralists have long played a prominent role in the history and economy of the Middle East, but their numbers seem to vary according to climatic conditions and the force of neighbouring states inducing permanent settlement. The Late Bronze Age seems to coincide with increasing aridity, which weakened neighbouring states and induced transhumance pastoralists to spend longer and longer periods with their flocks. Urban settlements (hitherto largely inhabited by Amorite, Canaaite, Hittite, and Ugarite peoples) in the Levant diminished in size until fully-nomadic pastoralist lifestyles came to dominate much of the region. The highly mobile competitive tribesmen, with their sudden raids, continually threatened long-distance trade and interfered with the collection of taxes and tribute.

The people who had long been the prominent population in what is now Syria (called the &quot;Land of the Amurru&quot; during their tenure) were the Amorites, a Northwest Semitic-speaking people who had appeared during the 25th century BCE, destroyed the hitherto dominant state of Ebla, founded the powerful state of Mari in the Levant and during the 19th century BCE also Babylonia, in southern Mesopotamia. However, they seem to have been displaced or wholly absorbed by the appearance of a people called the Ahlamu by the 13th century BCE and disappear from history. Ahlamû appears to be a generic term for Semitic wanderers and nomads of varying origins who appeared during the 13th century BCE across the ancient Near East, the Arabian Peninsula, Asia Minor, and Egypt.

The Arameans would appear to be one part of the larger generic Ahlamû group rather than synonymous with the Ahlamu. The presence of the Ahlamû is attested during the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365–1020 BCE), which already ruled many of the lands in which the Ahlamû arose in the Babylonian city of Nippur and even at Dilmun. Shalmaneser I (1274–1245 BCE) is recorded as having defeated Shattuara, King of the Mitanni and his Hittite and Ahlamû mercenaries. In the next century, the Ahlamû cut the road from Babylon to Hattusas. Also, Tukulti-Ninurta I (1244–1208 BCE) conquered Mari, Hanigalbat and Rapiqum on the Euphrates and &quot;the mountain of the Ahlamû&quot;, apparently the region of Jebel Bishri in northern Syria.

===Aramean states===
The emergence of the Arameans occurred during the Bronze Age collapse (1200–900 BCE), which saw great upheavals and mass movements of peoples across the Middle East, Asia Minor, the Caucasus, the East Mediterranean, North Africa, Ancient Iran, Ancient Greece and the Balkans and led to the genesis of new peoples and polities across those regions. The Middle Assyrian Empire (1365–1050 BCE), which had dominated the Near East and Asia Minor since the first half of the 14th century BCE, began to shrink rapidly after the death of Ashur-bel-kala, its last great ruler in 1056 BCE. The Assyrian withdrawal allowed the Arameans and others to gain independence and take firm control of Eber-Nari in the late 11th century BCE.

Some of the major Aramean-speaking city states included Aram-Damascus, Hamath, Bet-Adini, Bet-Bagyan, Bit-Hadipe, Aram-Bet Rehob, Aram-Zobah, Bet-Zamani, Bet-Halupe, and Aram-Ma&#x27;akah, as well as the Aramean tribal polities of the Gambulu, Litau and Puqudu. Akkermans and Schwartz note that in assessing Luwian and Aramean states in ancient Syria, the existing information on the ethnic composition of the regional states in ancient Syria primarily concerns the rulers and so the ethnolingustic situation of the majority of the population of the states is unclear. Furthermore, they mean that the material culture shows no distinctions between states dominated by the Luwians or the Arameans.

Aramean tribal groups were identified by family names that often began with the Semitic prefix &quot;Bit&quot;, meaning &quot;house of&quot;, such as &quot;Bit Adini&quot;. This naming convention was influenced by the writing system used by the coastal Phoenicians. Each tribe&#x27;s name signified the house or ancestral lineage to which it belonged. The term &quot;Aram&quot; sometimes referred only to a part and other times to the whole of the Syrian region during the Iron Age. The expressions “All Aram” and “Upper and Lower Aram” in Sefire treaty inscriptions have been variously interpreted but can suggest a degree of political and cultural unity among some of the polities in the area. 

Biblical sources tell that Saul, David and Solomon (late 11th to 10th centuries BC) fought against the small Aramean states ranged across the northern frontier of Israel: Aram-Sôvah in the Beqaa, Aram-Bêt-Rehob (Rehov) and Aram-Ma&#x27;akah around Mount Hermon, Geshur in the Hauran, and Aram-Damascus. An Aramean king&#x27;s account dating at least two centuries later, the Tel Dan stele, was discovered in northern Israel and is famous for being perhaps the earliest non-Israelite extra-biblical historical reference to the Israelite royal dynasty, the House of David. In the early 11th century BCE, much of Israel came under foreign rule for eight years according to the Book of Judges until Othniel defeated the forces led by Cushan-Rishathaim, who was titled in the Bible as ruler of Aram-Naharaim.

Further north, the Arameans gained possession of post-Hittite Hamath on the Orontes River and became strong enough to dissociate with the Indo-European-speaking post-Hittite states. The Arameans, together with the Edomites and the Ammonites, attacked Israel in the early 11th century BCE but were defeated.

During the 11th and the 10th centuries BCE, the Arameans conquered Sam&#x27;al and renamed it Bît-Agushi. They also conquered Til Barsip, which became the chief town of Bît-Adini, also known as Beth Eden. North of Sam&#x27;al was the Aramean state of Bit Gabbari, which was sandwiched between the post-Hittite states of Carchemish, Gurgum, Khattina, Unqi and Tabal (region). One of their earliest semi-independent kingdoms in northern Mesopotamia was Bît-Bahiâni (Tell Halaf).

Some Georgian linguists see a connection between the Kartvelian languages and the land of Tabal, citing the name of the  mentioned living on the Black Sea shores of Anatolia in the 5th century BCE by Herodotus of Halicarnassus and Xenophon.

===Under Neo-Assyrian rule===
The first certain reference to the Arameans appears in an Assyrian inscription of Tiglath-Pileser I, which refers to subjugating the &quot;Ahlamû-Arameans&quot; (&quot;Ahlame Armaia&quot;). Shortly afterward, the Ahlamû disappear from Assyrian annals and are replaced by the Arameans (&quot;Aramu, Arimi&quot;). That indicates that the Arameans had risen to dominance amongst the nomads. Among scholars, the relationship between the Akhlame and the Arameans is a matter of conjecture. By the late 12th century BCE, the Arameans had been firmly established in Syria; however, they were conquered by the Middle Assyrian Empire.

Assyrian annals from the end of the Middle Assyrian Empire c. 1050 BCE and the rise of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 911 BCE contain numerous descriptions of battles between Arameans and the Assyrian army. The Assyrians launched repeated raids into Aramean lands, Babylonia, Ancient Iran, Elam, Asia Minor, and even as far as the Mediterranean to keep its trade routes open. The Aramean city-states, like much of the Near East and Asia Minor, were subjugated by the Neo Assyrian Empire from the reign of Adad-nirari II in 911 BCE, who cleared Arameans and other tribal peoples from the borders of Assyria and began to expand in all directions. The process was continued by Ashurnasirpal II and his son Shalmaneser III, who destroyed many of the small Aramean tribes and conquered Aramean lands for the Assyrians. 

In 732 BCE, Aram-Damascus fell and was conquered by Assyrian King Tiglath-Pileser III. The Assyrians named their Aramean colonies Eber Nari but still used the term &quot;Aramean&quot; to describe many of its peoples. The Assyrians conducted forced deportations of hundreds of thousands of Arameans to both Assyria and Babylonia, where a migrant population already existed. Conversely, the Aramaic language was adopted as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the 8th century BCE, and the native Assyrians and Babylonians began to make a gradual language shift towards Aramaic as the most common language of public life and administration.

The Neo Assyrian Empire descended into a series of brutal internal wars from 626 BCE that weakened it greatly. That allowed a coalition of many its former subject peoples (Babylonians, Chaldeans, Medes, Persians, Parthians, Scythians, Sagartians and Cimmerians) to attack Assyria in 616 BCE, sack Nineveh in 612 BCE and finally defeat it between 605 and 599 BCE. During the war against Assyria, hordes of horse-borne Scythian and Cimmerian marauders ravaged through the Levant and all the way into Egypt.

As a result of migratory processes, various Aramean groups were settled throughout the ancient Near East, and their presence is recorded in the regions of Assyria, Babylonia, Anatolia, Phoenicia, Palestine, Egypt and Northern Arabia. Population transfers, conducted during the Neo-Assyrian Empire and followed by the gradual linguistic &quot;Aramization&quot; of non-Aramean populations, created a specific situation in the regions of Assyria proper among ancient Assyrians, who originally spoke the ancient Assyrian language, a dialect of Akkadian, but later accepted Aramaic.

===Neo-Babylonian Empire===
Eber-Nari was then ruled by the succeeding Neo-Babylonian Empire, which was initially headed by a short-lived Chaldean dynasty. The Aramean regions became a battleground between the Babylonians and the 26th Dynasty of Egypt, which had been installed by the Assyrians as vassals after they had defeated and ejected the previous Nubian-ruled 25th Dynasty. The Egyptians, having entered the region in a belated attempt to aid their former Assyrian masters, fought the Babylonians, initially with the help of remnants of the Assyrian army, in the region for decades before they were finally vanquished.

The Babylonians remained masters of the Aramean lands only until 539 BCE, when the Persian Achaemenid Empire overthrew Nabonidus, the Assyrian-born last king of Babylon, who had himself overthrown the Chaldean dynasty in 556 BCE.

===Under Achaemenid and Hellenistic rule===

The Arameans were later conquered by the Achaemenid Empire (539–332 BCE). However, little changed from the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian times, as the Persians, seeing themselves as successors of previous empires, maintained Imperial Aramaic as the main language of public life and administration. Provincial administrative structures also remained the same, and the name Eber Nari still applied to the region.

The conquests of Alexander the Great marked the beginning of a new era in the history of the entire Near East, including the regions inhabited by Arameans. By the late 4th century BCE, two newly created Hellenistic states emerged as main pretenders for regional supremacy: the Seleucid Empire (305–64 BCE) and the Ptolemaic Empire (305–30 BCE). Since earlier times, ancient Greeks commonly used &quot;Syrian&quot; labels as designations for Arameans and heir lands, but it was during the Hellenistic (Seleucid-Ptolemaic) period that the term &quot;Syria&quot; was finally defined to designate the regions west of the Euphrates, as opposed to the term &quot;Assyria&quot;, which designated the regions further east.

In the 3rd century BCE, various narratives related to the history of earlier Aramean states became accessible to wider audiences after the translation of the Hebrew Bible into the Greek language. Known as Septuagint, the translation was created in Alexandria, the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt that was the most important city of the Hellenistic world and was one of the main centres of Hellenization. Influenced by Greek terminology, translators decided to adopt ancient Greek custom of using &quot;Syrian&quot; labels as designations for Arameans and their lands and thus abandon the endonymic (native) terms that were used in the Hebrew Bible. In Septuagint, the region of Aram was commonly labelled as &quot;Syria&quot;, and the Arameans were labelled as &quot;Syrians&quot;. When reflecting on traditional influences of Greek terminology on English translations of the Septuagint, American orientalist Robert W. Rogers noted in 1921 that it was unfortunate that the change also affected later English versions. In Greek sources, two writers spoke particularly clearly on the Arameans. Posidonius, born in Apamea, as quoted by Strabo, writes: &quot;Those people whom we Greeks call Syrioi, call themselves Aramaioi&quot;. Further, Josephus, who was born in Jerusalem, defines the regions of &quot;Aram&#x27;s sons&quot; as the Tranchonitis, Damascus &quot;midway between Palestine and Coelo-Syria&quot;, Armenia, Bactria, and the Mesene around Spasini Charax.

===Early Christianity and Arab conquest===
The ancient Arameans lived in a close relationship with other distinct societies in the region. Throughout much of their history, they were heavily influenced by the cuneiform culture of Mesopotamia and the surrounding areas. Bilingual texts in Aramaic and the Assyrian dialect of Akkadian are among the earliest examples of Aramaic writing. In the western regions, Aramean states had close contact with Israel, Phoenicia, and northern Arabia. The Phoenician god Baʿalšamem was even incorporated into the Aramean tradition. Identifying distinct elements of the Aramean heritage in later times is challenging because of the diverse influences on their culture. For example, the earliest Syriac legal documents contain legal formulae that could be considered Aramean, but they could also be interpreted as Neo-Assyrian or Neo-Babylonian.

After the establishment of Roman Syria in the 1st century BCE, Aramean lands became the frontier region between two empires, Roman and Parthian, and later between their successor states, the Byzantine and Sasanid Empires. Several minor states also existed in frontier regions, most notably the Kingdom of Osroene, centred in the city of Edessa, known in Aramaic as Urhay. However, it is not easy in either pre-Christian or Christian periods to trace purely-Aramean elements in Edessan culture.

During the Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages, the Ancient Greek custom of using &quot;Syrian&quot; labels for Arameans and their language started to gain acceptance among an Aramaic-speaking literary and ecclesiastical elites. The practice of using &quot;Syrian&quot; labels as designations for Aramaic-speakers and their language was very common among ancient Greeks, and under their influence, the practice also became common among the Romans and Byzantines.

An Arabization process was initiated after the Arab conquest in the 7th century. In the religious sphere of life, Aramaic-speaking Christians (such as Melkites in Palestine) were exposed to Islamization, which created a base for gradual acceptance of the Arabic language not only as the dominant language of Islamic prayer and worship but also as a common language of public and domestic life. The acceptance of Arabic language became the main vessel of the gradual Arabization of Aramean communities throughout the Near East and ultimately resulted in their fragmentation and acculturation. Those processes affected not only Islamized Aramaic-speakers but also some of those who remained Christians, which created local communities of Arabic-speaking Christians of Syriac Christian origin who spoke Arabic in their public and domestic life but continued to belong to churches that used the liturgical Aramaic/Syriac language.

In the 10th century, the Byzantine Empire gradually reconquered much of northern Syria and upper Mesopotamia, including the cities of Melitene (934) and Antioch (969) and thus liberated local Aramaic-speaking Christian communities from the Muslim rule. Byzantines favoured Eastern Orthodoxy, but the leadership of the Antiochian Oriental Orthodox Patriarchate succeeded in reaching agreement with the Byzantine authorities and thus secured religious tolerance. The Byzantines extended their rule up to Edessa (1031) but were forced into a general retreat from Syria during the course of the 11th century and were pushed back by the newly-arrived Seljuk Turks, who took Antioch (1084). The later establishment of Crusader states (1098), the Principality of Antioch and the County of Edessa, created new challenges for local Aramaic-speaking Christians, both Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox.

==Culture==
The Iron Age culture of Syria is a topic of interest among scholars but is never referred to simply as &quot;Aramean&quot;. Scholars have difficulty in identifying and isolating characteristic Aramean elements in the culture. Even in North Syria, where more substantial evidence is available, scholars still find it difficult to identify what is genuinely Aramean from what is borrowed from other cultures. Widespread scholarly opinion still maintains that since several ethnic groups, such as Luwians and Aramaeans, interacted in the region, one material culture with &quot;mixed&quot; elements resulted. The material culture appears to be so homogeneous that it &quot;shows no clear distinctions between states dominated by Luwians or Aramaeans&quot;.

===Language===


Arameans were mostly defined by their use of the West Semitic Old Aramaic language (1100 BCE – 200 CE), which was first written using the Phoenician alphabet but over time modified to a specifically-Aramaic alphabet.
Aramaic first appeared in history during the opening centuries of the Iron Age, when several newly-emerging chiefdoms decided to use it as a written language. The process coincided with a change from syllabic cuneiform to alphabetic scribal culture and the rise of a novel style of public epigraphy, which was formerly unattested in Syria-Palestine. The language is considered a sister branch of the idiom used in the Bronze-Age city-state of Ugarit, on the one hand, and Canaanite, which comprises languages further south in the speech area such as Hebrew, Phoenician, and Moabite, on the other hand. All three branches can be subsumed under the more general rubric Northwest Semitic and thus share a common origin. The earliest direct witnesses of Aramaic, which were composed between the 10th and 8th centuries BC, are unanimously subsumed under the term &quot;Old Aramaic&quot;. The early writings exhibit variation and anticipate the enormous linguistic diversity within the Aramaic language group. Despite the variation, they are connected by common literary forms and formulaic expressions. 

As early as the 8th century BCE, Aramaic competed with the East Semitic Akkadian language and script in Assyria and Babylonia and then spread throughout the Near East in various dialects. By around 800 BCE, Aramaic had become the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which continued during the Achaemenid period as Imperial Aramaic. Although it was marginalized by Greek during the Hellenistic period, Aramaic in its varying dialects remained unchallenged as the common language of all Semitic peoples of the region until the Arabs&#x27; Islamic conquest of Mesopotamia in the 7th century AD, when the language became gradually superseded by Arabic.

The vernacular dialects of Eastern Old Aramaic, spoken during the Neo-Assyrian, Neo-Babylonian, and Achaemenid Persian empires, developed into various Eastern Middle Aramaic dialects. Among these were the Aramaic dialects of the ancient region of Osrhoene, one of which later became the liturgical language of Syriac Christianity. In the first centuries AD, the Christian Bible was translated into Aramaic and by the 4th century, the local Aramaic dialect of Edessa (Syriac: &quot;Urhay&quot;) had evolved into a literary language known as Edessan Aramaic (Syriac: &quot;Urhaya&quot;). Since Edessan Aramaic (&quot;Urhaya&quot;) was the primary liturgical language of Aramaic Christianity, it also became known as &quot;Edessan Syriac&quot; and was later defined by Western scholars as &quot;Classical Syriac&quot;. This laid the foundation for the term &quot;Syriac Christianity&quot;. The Eastern Orthodox patriarchates were dominated by Greek episcopate and Greek linguistic and cultural traditions. The use of the Aramaic language in liturgical and literary life among Melkites of Jewish descent persisted throughout the Middle Ages until the 14th century, as exemplified in the use of a specific regional dialect known as Christian Palestinian Aramaic or &quot;Palestinian Syriac&quot; in the Palestine region, Transjordan and Sinai.

Descendant Neo-Aramaic languages of the Eastern Aramaic branch continue to serve as the spoken and written languages of the Assyrians, Mandeans and Mizrahi Jews. These languages are primarily found in Iraq, northwestern Iran, southeastern Turkey and northeastern Syria, and to a lesser extent, in migrant communities in Armenia, Georgia, Russia, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan and Azerbaijan, as well as in Assyrian diaspora communities in the West, particularly in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Sweden, Australia and Germany.

Western Neo-Aramaic, the only surviving modern variety of the Western branch, is now spoken by Muslims and Christians solely in Maaloula and Jubb&#x27;adin in the Qalamoun mountains of southwestern Syria.

During the early modern period, the study of the Aramaic language, both ancient and modern, was initiated among Western scholars. This led to the formation of Aramaic studies as a broader multidisciplinary field, encompassing the study of the cultural and historical heritage of Aramaic. The linguistic and historical aspects of Aramaic studies have been further expanded since the 19th century through archaeological excavations of ancient sites in the Near East.

===Religion===

What is known of the religion of the Aramean groups is derived from excavated objects and temples and by Aramaic literary sources, as well as the names they had. Their religion did not feature any particular deity that could be called an Aramean god or goddess. It appears from their inscriptions and their names that the Arameans worshipped Canaanite and Mesopotamian gods such as Hadad, Sin, Ishtar (whom they called Astarte), Shamash, Tammuz, Bel and Nergal, and Canaaite-Phoenecian deities such as the storm-god, El, the supreme deity of Canaan, in addition to Anat (‘Atta) and others.

The Arameans who lived outside their homelands apparently followed the traditions of the countries in which they settled. The King of Damascus, for instance, employed Phoenician sculptors and ivory-carvers. In Tell Halaf-Guzana, the palace of Kapara, an Aramean ruler (9th century BCE) was decorated with orthostates and with statues that display a mixture of Mesopotamian, Hittite and Hurrian influences.

==Legacy==
The legacy of ancient Arameans became of particular interest for scholars during the early modern period and resulted in the emergence of Aramaic studies as a distinctive field, dedicated to the study of the Aramaic language. By the 19th century, the &quot;Aramean question&quot; was formulated, and several scholarly theses were proposed regarding the development of the language and the history of the Arameans.

===Modern identity===
In modern times, an Aramean identity is held mainly by a number of Syriac Christian groups, predominantly from southeastern Turkey and parts of Syria. Aramean identity is most predominant among ethnic Assyrians, and as such, is most often used in the Assyrian diaspora, especially in Germany and Sweden. However, other groups such as Maronites, Arab Christians, and the Arameans of Maaloula and Jubb&#x27;adin may also identify strongly under the label.

In 2014, Israel officially recognised Arameans as a distinctive minority. Questions related to the minority rights of Arameans in some other countries were also brought to international attention.

<text>Viscount Hawarden is a title in the Peerage of Ireland.

== Creation ==
It was created in 1793 for Sir Cornwallis Maude, 3rd Baronet, who had earlier represented the borough of Roscommon in the Irish House of Commons. He had succeeded his older brother, Sir Thomas, as third Baronet of Dundrum. He married Mary, a niece of Ralph Allen, through whom lands in Combe Down, Somerset, came into his family. His son, the third Viscount, sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1836 to 1850. His son, the fourth Viscount, was an Irish Representative Peer from 1862 to 1886 and served as a government whip from 1866 to 1868 and from 1874 to 1880 in the Conservative administrations of the Earl of Derby and Benjamin Disraeli. In 1886 the fourth Viscount was created Earl de Montalt, of Dundrum in the County of Tipperary, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. However, this title became extinct on his death in 1905 while he was succeeded in his other titles by his cousin, the fifth Viscount. He was the eldest son of the Very Reverend the Hon. Robert William Henry Maude, second son of the first Viscount. His son, the sixth Viscount, was killed at an early age in France during the First World War while serving as a lieutenant in the Coldstream Guards
and was succeeded by his cousin, the seventh Viscount. He was the son of Ludlow Eustace Maude, younger son of the aforementioned Robert William Henry Maude. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the ninth Viscount, who succeeded his father in 1991.

The Maude Baronetcy, of Dundrum in the County of Tipperary, was created in the Baronetage of Ireland on 9 May 1705 for the first Viscount&#x27;s father Robert Maude. He represented Gowran, Canice and Bangor in the Irish House of Commons. His eldest son, the second Baronet, sat as a Member of the Irish Parliament for County Tipperary. In 1776 he was created Baron de Montalt, of Hawarden in the County of Tipperary, in the Peerage of Ireland. However, this title became extinct on his death in 1777 while he was succeeded in the baronetcy by his younger brother, the aforementioned third Baronet, for whom the barony was revived in 1785.

== Family Seat ==
The family seat is Great Bossington Farm, near Adisham, Kent.

The former was Dundrum House, an eighteenth-century Palladian house in the style of Sir Edward Lovett Pearce, near Cashel, County Tipperary. An extra storey was added to the house c.1890 by 4th Viscount Hawarden. After being sold by the Maude family in 1908, the house became a convent. It later became a hotel, in 1981.

<doc id="470229" wikidata="Q36109" url="?curid=470229" title="Maithili language">
<text>Maithili ( , ) is an Indo-Aryan language spoken in parts of India and Nepal. It is native to the Mithila region, which encompasses parts of the eastern Indian states of Bihar and Jharkhand as well as Nepal&#x27;s Koshi and Madhesh Provinces. It is one of the 22 scheduled languages of India. It is the second most commonly spoken language of Nepal. It is also one of the fourteen provincial official languages of Nepal.

It is spoken by 21.7 million people. Of those, 3.2 million are Nepalese people. The language is predominantly written in Devanagari, but the historical Tirhuta and Kaithi scripts retained some use until today.

==Official status==
In 2003, Maithili was included in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution as a recognised Indian language, which allows it to be used in education, government, and other official contexts in India. The Maithili language is included as an optional paper in the UPSC Exam. In March 2018, Maithili received the second official language status in the Indian state of Jharkhand.

Gopal Jee Thakur of the Bharatiya Janata Party is the first Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha who speaks in the Maithili language in the Parliament of India. He is currently the MP for Darbhanga.

The Nepalese Languages Commission has made Maithili an official Nepalese language used for administration in Koshi province and Madhesh Province.

On 26 November 2024, during the occasion of the Constitution Day, Maithili version of the Indian constitution was launched by the President of India Droupadi Murmu.

==Distribution==
In India, it is mainly spoken in Darbhanga, Tirhut, Kosi, Purnia, Bhagalpur and Munger divisions of Bihar &amp; in Santhal Pargana division of Jharkhand.

In Nepal, Maithili is spoken in Madhesh Province and Koshi Province.

Darbhanga, Madhubani, and Janakpur constitutes important cultural and linguistic centers of Maithili language.

==Classification==
In 1870s, Beames considered Maithili a dialect of a Bengali. Hoernlé initially treated it as a dialect of Eastern Hindi, but after comparing it with the Gaudian languages, recognised that it shows more similarities with the Bengali language than with Hindi. Grierson recognised it as a distinct language, grouped under &#x27;Bihari&#x27; and published its first grammar in 1881.

Chatterji grouped Maithili with the Magadhi Prakrit.

=== Dialects ===
Maithili varies greatly in dialects.

* The standard form of Maithili is Sotipura also called Central Maithili which is mainly spoken in Darbhanga, Madhubani, Supaul, Madhepura, Purnia, Samastipur, Araria and Saharsa districts of India and in Nepal it is spoken in Dhanusha, Mahottari, Siraha, Saptari, Sarlahi and Sunsari, and Morang districts.
* Bajjika dialect also known as Western Maithili is mainly spoken in Sitamarhi, Muzaffarpur, Vaishali and Sheohar districts of Bihar, India &amp; Rautahat, and Sarlahi districts of Nepal. It is listed as a distinct language in Nepal and overlaps by 76–86% with Maithili dialects spoken in Dhanusa, Morang, Saptari and Sarlahi Districts.
* Thēthi dialect is spoken mainly in Kosi, Purnia and Munger divisions and Mokama in Bihar and some adjoining districts of Nepal.
* Angika dialect is mainly spoken in and around Bhagalpur, Banka, Jamui, Lakhisarai, Munger districts of Bihar and Godda, Sahebganj, Dumka, Deoghar districts of Jharkhand.
* Several other dialects of Maithili are spoken in India and Nepal, including Dehati, Deshi, Kisan, Bantar, Barmeli, Musar, Tati and Jolaha. All the dialects are intelligible to native Maithili speakers.

==Origin and history==
The name Maithili is derived from the word Mithila, an ancient kingdom of which King Janaka was the ruler (see Ramayana). Maithili is also one of the names of Sita, the wife of King Rama and daughter of King Janaka. Scholars in Mithila used Sanskrit for their literary work and Maithili was the language of the common folk (Abahattha).

The beginning of Maithili language and literature can be traced back to the &#x27;Charyapadas&#x27;, a form of Buddhist mystical verses, composed during the period of 700-1300 AD. These padas were written in Sandhya bhasa by several Siddhas who belonged to Vajrayana Buddhism and were scattered throughout the territory of Assam, Bengal, Bihar and Odisha. Several of the Siddhas were from the Mithila region such as Kanhapa, Sarhapa etc. Prominent scholars like Rahul Sankrityanan, Subhadra Jha and Jayakant Mishra provided evidence and proved that the language of Charyapada is ancient Maithili or proto Maithili.
Apart from Charyapadas, there has been a rich tradition of folk culture, folk songs and which were popular among the common folks of the Mithila region.

After the fall of Pala rule, disappearance of Buddhism, establishment of Karnāta kings and patronage of Maithili under Harisimhadeva (1226–1324) of Karnāta dynasty dates back to the 14th century (around 1327 AD). Jyotirishwar Thakur (1280–1340) wrote a unique work &quot;Varnaratnākara&quot; in Maithili prose. The &quot;Varna Ratnākara&quot; is the earliest known prose text, written by Jyotirishwar Thakur in Mithilaksar script, and is the first prose work not only in Maithili but in any modern Indian language.

In 1324, Ghyasuddin Tughluq, the emperor of Delhi invaded Mithila, defeated Harisimhadeva, entrusted Mithila to his family priest and a great Military Scholar Kameshvar Jha, a Maithil Brahmin of the Oinwar dynasty. But the disturbed era did not produce any literature in Maithili until Vidyapati Thakur (1360 to 1450), who was an epoch-making poet under the patronage of king Shiva Singh and his queen Lakhima Devi. He produced over 1,000 immortal songs in Maithili on the theme of love of Radha and Krishna and the domestic life of Shiva and Parvati as well as on the subject of suffering of migrant labourers of Morang and their families; besides, he wrote a number of treaties in Sanskrit. His love-songs spread far and wide in no time and enchanted saints, poets and youth. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu saw the divine light of love behind these songs, and soon these songs became themes of Vaisnava sect of Bengal. Rabindranath Tagore, out of curiosity, imitated these songs under the pseudonym Bhanusimha. Vidyapati influenced the religious literature of Asama, Bengal, Utkala and gave birth to a new Brajabuli /Brajavali language.

The earliest reference to Maithili or Tirhutiya is in Amaduzzi&#x27;s preface to Beligatti&#x27;s &quot;Alphabetum Brammhanicum&quot;, published in 1771. This contains a list of Indian languages among which is &#x27;Tourutiana.&#x27; Colebrooke&#x27;s essay on the Sanskrit and Prakrit languages, written in 1801, was the first to describe Maithili as a distinct dialect.

Many devotional songs were written by Vaisnava saints, including in the mid-17th century, Vidyapati and Govindadas. Mapati Upadhyaya wrote a drama titled &quot;Pārijātaharaṇa&quot; in Maithili. Professional troupes, mostly from dalit classes known as Kirtanias, the singers of bhajan or devotional songs, started to perform this drama in public gatherings and the courts of the nobles.
Lochana (c. 1575 – c. 1660) wrote &quot;Rāgatarangni&quot;, a significant treatise on the science of music, describing the rāgas, tālas, and lyrics prevalent in Mithila.

During the Malla dynasty&#x27;s rule Maithili spread far and wide throughout Nepal from the 16th to the 17th century. During this period, at least seventy Maithili dramas were produced. In the drama &quot;Harishchandranrityam&quot; by Siddhinarayanadeva (1620–57), some characters speak pure colloquial Maithili, while others speak Bengali, Sanskrit or Prakrit. One notable Malla King who patronised Maithili was Bhupatindra Malla who composed 26 plays in the Maithili language during his lifetime.

After the demise of Maheshwar Singh, the ruler of Darbhanga Raj, in 1860, the Raj was taken over by the British Government as regent. The Darbhanga Raj returned to his successor, Maharaj Lakshmishvar Singh, in 1898. The Zamindari Raj had a lackadaisical approach toward Maithili. The use of Maithili language was revived through personal efforts of MM Parameshvar Mishra, Chanda Jha, Munshi Raghunandan Das and others.

Publication of &quot;Maithil Hita Sadhana&quot; (1905), &quot;Mithila Moda&quot; (1906), and &quot;Mithila Mihir&quot; (1908) further encouraged writers. The first social organisation, Maithil Mahasabha, was established in 1910 for the development of Mithila and Maithili. It blocked its membership for people outside of the Maithil Brahmin and Karna Kayastha castes. Maithil Mahasabha campaigned for the official recognition of Maithili as a regional language. Calcutta University recognised Maithili in 1917, and other universities followed suit.

Babu Bhola Lal Das wrote &quot;Maithili Grammar&quot; (&quot;Maithili Vyakaran&quot;). He edited a book &quot;Gadya Kusumanjali&quot; and edited a journal &quot;Maithili&quot;.
In 1965, Maithili was officially accepted by Sahitya Academy, an organisation dedicated to the promotion of Indian literature.

In 2002, Maithili was recognised on the VIII schedule of the Indian Constitution as a major Indian language; Maithili is now one of the twenty-two Scheduled languages of India.

The publishing of Maithili books in Mithilakshar script was started by Acharya Ramlochan Saran.

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
*All vowels have nasal counterparts, represented by &quot;~&quot; in IPA and ँ on the vowels, like आँ ãː .
*All vowel sounds are realised as nasal when occurring before or after a nasal consonant.
* Sounds eː and oː are often replaced by diphthongs əɪ̯ and əʊ̯.
*ɔ is replaced by ə in northern dialects and by o in southernmost dialects.
*There are three short vowels that were described by Grierson, but are not counted by modern grammarians. But they could be understood as syllable break: ॳ , इ , उ . Or as syllable break ऺ in Devanagari and &quot;.&quot; in IPA.
* ꣾ is a Unicode letter in Devanagari, (IPA ) which is not supported currently on several browsers and operating systems, along with its mātrā (vowel sign).
The following diphthongs are present:
: अय़(ꣾ) - अय़सन (ꣾ सन) &#x27;like this&#x27;
: अव़(ॵ) - चव़मुख(चॏमुख) &#x27;four faced&#x27;
: अयॆ - अयॆलाः &#x27;came&#x27;
: अवॊ (अऒ) - अवॊताः &#x27;will come&#x27;
: आइ - आइ &#x27;today&#x27;
: आउ - आउ &#x27;come please&#x27;
: आयॆ (आऎ) - आयॆल &#x27;came&#x27;
: आवॊ (आऒ) - आवॊब &#x27;will come&#x27;
: यु (इउ) - घ्यु &#x27;ghee&#x27;
: यॆ (इऎ) - यॆः &#x27;only this&#x27;
: यॊ (इऒ) - कह्यो &#x27;any day&#x27;
: वि (उइ) - द्वि &#x27;two&#x27;
: वॆ (उऎ) - वॆ: &#x27;only that&#x27;

A peculiar type of phonetic change is recently taking place in Maithili by way of epenthesis, i.e. backward transposition of final /i/ and /u/ in all sort of words. Thus:

Standard Colloquial - Common Pronunciation
: अछि - अइछ &#x27;is&#x27;
: रवि - रइब &#x27;Sunday&#x27;
: मधु - मउध &#x27;honey&#x27;
: बालु - बाउल &#x27;sand&#x27;

===Consonants===
Maithili has four classes of stops, one class of affricate, which is generally treated as a stop series, related nasals, fricatives and approximant.

* Fricative sounds only occur marginally, and are typically pronounced as a dental fricative in most styles of pronunciation. ः is always added after a vowel.

====Stops====
There are four series of stops- bilabials, coronals, retroflex and velar, along with an affricate series. All of them show the four way contrast like most of the modern Indo-Aryan languages:

* tenuis, as , which is like ⟨p⟩ in English &quot;spin&quot;
* voiced, as , which is like ⟨b⟩ in English &quot;bin&quot;
* aspirated, as , which is like ⟨p⟩ in English &quot;pin&quot;, and
* murmured or aspirated voiced, as .

Apart from the retroflex series, all the rest four series show full phonological contrast in all positions. The retroflex tenius and show full contrast in all positions. and show phonological contrast mainly word-initially. Both are defective phonemes, occurring intervocalically and word finally only if preceded by a nasal consonant. Word finally and postvocalically, surfaces as . Non-initially, both are interchangeable with and respectively.

====Fricatives====
 and are most common fricatives. They show full phonological opposition. , which is present in tatsama words, is replaced by most of the times, when independent, and prevocalic is replaced by , or . occurs before and before . and occurs in Perso-Arabic loanwords, generally replaced by and respectively. and also occurs in Sanskrit words (jihvamuliya and upadhmaniya), which is peculiar to Maithili.

====Sonorants====
 and are present in all phonological positions. occurs only non-initially and is followed by a homorganic stop, which may be deleted if voiced, which leads to the independent presence of . occurs non-initially, followed by a homorganic stop, and is independent only in tatsama words, which is often replaced with . occurs only non-initially and is followed by a homorganic stop always. It is the only nasal which does not occur independently.
* In most styles of pronunciation, the retroflex flap occurs marginally. It is usually pronounced as an alveolar tap sound, and is often interchanged with .
* Approximant sounds and fricative sounds , mainly occur in words that are borrowed from Sanskrit or in words of Perso-Arabic origin. The conjunct ष्प (IAST &quot;ṣp&quot;) is pronounced in Maithili e.g. पुष्प . The conjunct ह्य (IAST &quot;hy&quot;) is pronounced as in ग्रऻह्य (&quot;grahya&quot;) .

There are four non-syllabic vowels in Maithili-
i̯, u̯, e̯, o̯ written in Devanagari as य़, व़, य़ॆ, व़ॊ. Most of the times, these are written without nukta.

===Nouns===
An example declension:
===Adjectives===
The difference between adjectives and nouns is very minute in Maithili. However, there are marked adjectives there in Maithili.

===Pronouns===

Pronouns in Maithili are declined in similar way to nominals, though in most pronouns the genitive case has a different form. The lower forms below are accusative and postpositional. The plurals are formed periphrastically.
==Orthography==

Beginning in the 14th century, the language was written in the Tirhuta script (also known as Mithilakshara or Maithili), which is related to the Bengali-Assamese script. By the early 20th century, this script was largely associated with the Mithila Brahmans, with most others using Kaithi, and Devanagari spreading under the influence of the scholars at Banaras. Throughout the course of the century, Devanagari grew in use eventually replacing the other two, and has since remained the dominant script for Maithili. Tirhuta retained some specific uses (on signage in north Bihar as well as in religious texts, genealogical records and letters), and has seen a resurgence of interest in the 21st century.

The Tirhuta and Kaithi scripts are both currently included in Unicode.

<text>Miguel Induráin Larraya (; born 16 July 1964) is a retired Spanish road racing cyclist. Induráin won five Tours de France from 1991 to 1995, the fourth, and last, to win five times, and the only five-time winner to achieve those victories consecutively.

He won the Giro d&#x27;Italia twice, becoming one of seven people to achieve the Giro-Tour double in the same season. He wore the race leader&#x27;s yellow jersey in the Tour de France for 60 days. He holds the record for the most consecutive Tour de France wins and shares the record for most wins with Jacques Anquetil, Bernard Hinault and Eddy Merckx. In 1993, Indurain came close to cycling&#x27;s &#x27;Triple Crown&#x27; when, after having already won the Giro and the Tour, he finished just 0:19 behind in the World Championship.

Induráin&#x27;s ability and physical size— and —earned him the nickname &quot;Miguelón&quot; or &quot;Big Mig&quot;. He was the youngest rider ever to win the Spanish amateur national road championship, when he was 18, at 20 the youngest rider to lead the Vuelta a España, and at 20 he won a stage of the Tour de l&#x27;Avenir.

== Early life and amateur career ==
Miguel Induráin was born in the village of Villava (now Villava – Atarrabia), which is now an outlying area of Pamplona. He has three sisters – Isabel, María Dolores and María Asunción – and a brother, Prudencio, who also became a professional cyclist. His first bicycle was a green secondhand Olmo given to him for his 10th birthday. It was stolen when he was 11 and he worked in the fields with his father to pay for a new one.

Induráin tried running, basketball, javelin and football from nine to 14. Then he joined the local CC Villavés and rode his first race in July 1978, an event for unlicensed riders in which he finished second. He won his second race and competed every week thereafter. His hero in cycling was Bernard Hinault. At 18 he was the youngest winner of the national amateur road championship.

== Professional career ==
In 1984 he rode in the Olympic Games at Los Angeles and then turned professional on 4 September for . He won his first professional race a week later, a time trial in the Tour de l&#x27;Avenir. In 1985 he started the Vuelta a España and came second in the prologue, behind Bert Oosterbosch. Oosterbosch lost time on the second stage and Induráin became leader, the youngest rider to do so. He rode the Tour de France later that year, as he would do in each of the next 11 years, but dropped out in the fourth stage.

In 1986, Induráin again rode the Tour, dropping out on the 12th stage. He started the 1987 Vuelta a España with bronchitis from the Tour of Belgium. He rode the 1988 Tour de France as teammate of the winner Pedro Delgado. In 1989, he escaped during the ninth stage of the Tour de France. He won the stage and became leader of the mountains classification, wearing the polkadot jersey the next stage, the only time in his career. In 1990, Induráin rode the Tour de France again for Delgado, but Delgado could not win. Induráin finished 10th place, sacrificing several places by waiting for Delgado.

Induráin was a strong time trialist, gaining on rivals and riding defensively in the climbing stages. Induráin won only two Tour stages that were not individual time trials: mountain stages to Cauterets (1989) and Luz Ardiden (1990) in the Pyrenees. During his five consecutive Tour de France wins he never won a stage that was not a time trial. These superior abilities in the discipline fit perfectly with the TT heavy Tours of the era, with many featuring between 150 and 200 km of time trialling vs the more common 50–80 km today.

=== 1991: First Tour win ===

In 1991, Greg LeMond was favourite for the Tour and while Induráin was a fine time trialist he was considered too large to be a good climber. LeMond led the race until the 12th stage but on the 13th he broke down on the Tourmalet, and lost more than seven minutes to Induráin, who became the leader and stayed leader to the end.

=== 1992: Tour-Giro double ===
Induráin won the prologue at San Sebastián and seized the yellow jersey, only to lose it the next day. Induráin finished the time trial in stage nine, over 65 km, three minutes ahead of number two on the stage. Near the end he caught Laurent Fignon, who had started six minutes before him. The 1992 Tour was remarkable for a long breakaway by Claudio Chiappucci on a stage to Sestriere that included six mountains. Induráin seemed to crack on the final climb to Sestriere being passed by Franco Vona but managed to finish third, enough to claim the yellow jersey once more. From here Induráin would establish his racing style &quot;crush rivals in the time trials and control them in the mountains&quot; His defensive tactic brought criticism from Induráin&#x27;s boyhood hero, Bernard Hinault, who said: &quot;Induráin is the best rider of his generation but he has won this Tour quietly, without great opposition. If the opposition continues to let him get away with it, his reign looks like lasting a long time&quot;.

He also won the Giro d&#x27;Italia in 1992. After winning the early time trial, Induráin gained a decisive advantage on stage 9 to Latina-Terminillo. There, on the first summit finish of the race, Induráin finished in the first group, dropping the main contenders, and gaining 30 seconds on Chiappucci. On his way to overall victory by 5mins 12secs over Chiappucci, Induráin also won the final stage 21 time trial.

=== 1993: Second Tour-Giro double ===

Induráin rode the same way in the 1993 Tour. He won the prologue at Puy-du-Fou, in the Vendée region, and waited until the ninth stage, the 59 km time trial at Lac de Madine, to take control of the race. He won by 2m 11s. From then on, said Ollivier, he rode defensively, watching Tony Rominger, whom he considered a rival against the clock. Ollivier said Induráin&#x27;s ride wasn&#x27;t without effort but another historian, Pierre Chany, said it lacked audacity and that Induráin never &quot;did anything unprovoked which would have allowed this exceptional rider to rise above the rest and excite the crowd&quot;.

He won the 1993 Giro d&#x27;Italia.

=== 1994: Tour and hour record ===

Induráin again won the first time trial, the ninth stage from Périgueux to Bergerac, in the southwest. He beat Rominger by two minutes. He did, however, attack in the Pyrenees, accelerating at the foot of the 10 km climb to the ski station at Hautacam. Luc Leblanc, Richard Virenque, Marco Pantani and Armand de Las Cuevas stayed with him but other rivals, including Rominger, were left behind. Induráin lost the stage to Leblanc but kept the yellow jersey to the end.

In 1994 he set a world hour record of , beating Graeme Obree.

Induráin entered the Giro again, but this time was beaten by Evgeni Berzin and Marco Pantani, who had prepared solely for the Giro.

In May 1994, Induráin tested positive for salbutamol following the &quot;Tour de L&#x27;Oise&quot; in France. Though the β2-adrenergic agonist, found in nasal inhalers, was on the controlled substances list of both the IOC and UCI, both organizations permitted sportsmen with asthma to use it. However, in France there was an outright ban on its use. The IOC agreed with the UCI that Induráin would not be punished for using a drug banned outright in France because they accepted the salbutamol was contained in a nasal inhaler he had been using legitimately to aid his respiration. In Spain, the incident was interpreted as another case of the French attempting to hinder Induráin&#x27;s domination of the sport.

=== 1995: Fifth Tour victory ===
He also won the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré in 1995.

The seventh stage of the 1995 Tour linked Charleroi and Liège, both in southern Belgium. It took in the rolling roads of Liège–Bastogne–Liège. Induráin attacked with Johan Bruyneel following and the rest were left 50 seconds behind. The following day Induráin won the first time trial, organised on a demanding circuit at Seraing. Jean-Paul Ollivier wrote: &quot;It offered him another chance to assert his authority. Who could challenge him? The hierarchy established itself by itself. Induráin once again set off on a demonstration Tour. This last victory by the rider from Navarra was a model of strength, intelligence and authority, all well controlled. There wasn&#x27;t a tactical error, never a scare, no moments of weakness&quot;.

Induráin won the world time trial championship.

=== 1996: Aiming for sixth Tour victory ===

He also won the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré in 1996.

Induráin aimed for a sixth victory in the 1996 Tour, but suffered from the beginning. He came seventh in the prologue. After bronchitis in a cold and wet first week, he lost time from stage seven. He said that, on the Cormet de Roselend on 6 July, &quot;my legs started to feel odd but, because the speed of the group wasn&#x27;t very high, I didn&#x27;t take much notice. I even imagined attacking at the foot of the Arcs climbs.&quot; He dropped out of the group and lost three minutes in three kilometres. Race referees penalised him 20 seconds for accepting a bottle of drink in the last kilometre. He said the 20 seconds were nothing compared to the minute he would have lost had he not taken the bottle. He later said he would stop racing. The Dane Bjarne Riis won and his teammate Jan Ullrich finished second. Induráin finished 11th and, in a stage passing through his hometown and ending in Pamplona, he finished 19th, eight minutes behind the stage winner.

He won the individual time trial in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, where professionals competed for the first time. He won the title ahead of compatriot Abraham Olano and Boardman. Asked if he would trade his gold medal for a sixth Tour victory, he confirmed, saying: &quot;For any professional cyclist, winning the Tour is the pinnacle of their career, whereas winning the Olympic title is purely symbolic&quot;. In the road race, he finished 26th.

In September 1996, Induráin rode the Vuelta a España at the insistence of his team. He dropped out unexpectedly on the Mirador del Fito, from the end of the stage to Covadonga. Relations with his team manager, José Miguel Echavarri, had been difficult since an aborted attempt on the hour record in Colombia in October 1995. The two are no longer on speaking terms.

== Retirement ==
Induráin took two months to consider his future, particularly the €4.5 million that Manolo Saiz was said to have offered him to transfer to the ONCE team. Negotiations foundered over which races Induráin would ride and whether Saiz would pay more. However, on 1 January 1997 he told 300 journalists and others in the El Toro hotel in Pamplona that he would not race again. &quot;This is a long and deeply meditated decision, especially as physically I&#x27;m in condition to win a sixth Tour&quot;, he said. &quot;In early 1996 I decided it was time to go, and I tried to win the Tour for the last time. When I didn&#x27;t, I thought the Olympics would be the perfect way of bowing out, but what happened after the Vuelta a España made me change my mind. Every year it gets harder and I think I have spent enough time in the sport. My family is waiting.&quot; After reading a prepared 30-line statement, he left without taking questions.

Induráin now divides his time between his native Pamplona and his house in Palma de Mallorca, on the Mediterranean. He and his wife, Marisa, have three children. He founded the Miguel Induráin Foundation in 1998 to promote sport in his home region of Navarra. He worked with the Spanish Olympic Committee to promote Sevilla&#x27;s candidature for the 2004 Olympics, and the Union Cycliste Internationale. He continues to ride a bike three or four times a week. He attends cyclotourist events such as L&#x27;Étape du Tour, the Mallorca312 and the Cape Argus Pick &amp; Pay Cycle Tour in Cape Town, South Africa.

== Physiology ==
According to the University of Ferrara, which conducted tests on Induráin, his strength came from his body&#x27;s superior physiology. His blood carried 7 litres of oxygen around his body per minute, compared to 3–4 litres for an ordinary person and 5–6 litres for fellow riders. His cardiac output was 50 litres a minute; a fit amateur cyclist&#x27;s is about 25 litres. Induráin&#x27;s lung capacity was 7.8 litres, compared to an average of 6 litres. His resting pulse was as low as 28 BPM, compared to an average 60–72 bpm, which meant his heart would be less strained in the tough mountain stages. His VO2 max was 88 ml/kg/min; in comparison, Lance Armstrong&#x27;s was 83.8 ml/kg/min and Greg LeMond&#x27;s was more than 92 ml/kg/min.

He consulted the Italian professor Francesco Conconi (famous for pioneering EPO use in sport) from 1987 and his weight dropped from to under his guidance, &quot;changing himself into an all-round rider&quot;, said Philippe Brunel in &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;. He was lighter than when he was a junior.

Induráin was subjected to further physical testing at age 46, 14 years after his retirement, in a 2012 published study to determine age-related fitness decline. His maximal values were oxygen uptake 5.29 L/min (57.4 mL · kg-1 · min-1) and aerobic power output 450 W (4.88 W/kg) and was found to have seen greater changes in body composition than aerobic capacity as he weighed 92 kg at the time. However, his absolute maximal and submaximal oxygen uptake and power output in 2012 still compared favorably with those exhibited by active professional cyclists.
=== Critics ===
Although Induráin, who has always denied doping, has never been banned or given a positive test for any sports-enhancing drug (with the exception of salbutamol), some remain skeptical of his achievements. Anti-doping expert Sandro Donati released information showing Induráin and his Banesto team were clients of Dr. Francesco Conconi, who was later found to be doping many of his cyclist clients. The Banesto team confirmed it met Conconi but only to conduct Conconi tests on its cyclists. Former Festina coach Antonie Vayer has also cast doubt on Induráin&#x27;s abilities, claiming only &quot;mutants&quot; could have performed at the level he did.

== Personality ==
Induráin resisted comparison to Tour champions of the past and said he &quot;never felt superior to anyone&quot;. He &quot;never had airs about himself and only reluctantly stepped into the limelight that came with the maillot jaune [yellow jersey]&quot;, Andy Hood wrote in &quot;Procycling&quot;.

Induráin was a man difficult to know. He was modest and quiet, &quot;governing his troops without ever being demanding.&quot; A Spanish journalist, frustrated that he could find nothing interesting about him, asked &quot;I wonder if his wife knows who this man is who sleeps beside her.&quot; A teammate, Jean-François Bernard said: &quot;When he comes down for his meal, you don&#x27;t even hear him move his chair.&quot;

&quot;Procycling&quot; wrote:

His five straight Tour crowns paralleled Spain&#x27;s coming of age following decades of repression under the dictatorship of General Franco and his face became a symbol of a new, more assertive Spain stepping confidently on to the European stage.

Philippe Brunel in &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; called him &quot;humble and sublime, taciturn some days. But who was this robotic athlete who, in his streamlined helmet and his Plexiglass visor, dominated [&quot;domestiquait&quot;] the time-trials like no one before him except perhaps Jacques Anquetil?&quot;

The magazine &quot;Cycling Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;He seems to do everything very slowly, as though he is trying to conserve energy even here. His eyes blink at half-speed but the gaze from his brown eyes is steady. He looks as relaxed off the bike as he does when he is on it, but you are aware that you are in the presence of a great bike rider.&quot;

Induráin said the man who most impressed him was Pope John Paul II, to whom he gave a yellow jersey from the Tour de France and a pink jersey from the Giro d&#x27;Italia. It is rare for genuine items from his cycling career to be in another&#x27;s collection, as he keeps most of his clothing, equipment etc., making such gifts special.

Induráin is a member of the Laureus World Sports Academy.

<doc id="470235" wikidata="Q5489233" url="?curid=470235" title="Frank Rizzo">
<text>Francis Lazarro Rizzo (October 23, 1920 – July 16, 1991) was an American police officer and politician. He served as commissioner of the Philadelphia Police Department (PPD) from 1967 to 1971 and mayor of Philadelphia from 1972 to 1980. He was a member of the Democratic Party throughout the entirety of his career in public office. He switched to the Republican Party in 1986 and campaigned as a Republican for the final five years of his life.

Rizzo was born to an Italian-American family in South Philadelphia, and joined the Philadelphia Police Department as an officer in 1943. He rose to public prominence as police commissioner, before seeking the mayor&#x27;s office in 1971. He was re-elected in 1975.

A polarizing figure during his lifetime, Rizzo&#x27;s legacy has come under greater scrutiny in the years since his death due to the prevalence of racism and brutality within the Philadelphia Police Department. Before, during, and after Rizzo&#x27;s tenure as police commissioner, the PPD engaged in patterns of police misconduct, in particular toward members of the black community. The patterns of police brutality were documented in a Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; series by William K. Marimow and Jon Neuman. As mayor, Rizzo, like many of his contemporaries, was opposed to the construction of public housing in established neighborhoods, most of which at the time housed majority-white populations.

Rizzo was barred from running for a third consecutive term as mayor by Philadelphia&#x27;s city charter. He attempted to vote in a charter change to allow him to attempt a run for reelection but was soundly defeated after urging supporters to &quot;vote white&quot;, which he later admitted was &quot;a poor choice of words&quot;. He unsuccessfully ran for another term in 1983 and 1987. In 1991, he sought the mayoralty again, but died during the election campaign. Rizzo became the subject of multiple memorials throughout Philadelphia, including a statue in Center City. It was removed in 2020, amid the George Floyd protests against police brutality.

==Early life==
Rizzo was born in Philadelphia, where his father Rafael was a police officer. He grew up in a South Philadelphia row house neighborhood. During his senior year he dropped out of Southern High School; he later earned a high school equivalency diploma and took government courses at the Fels Institute of Government.

Enlisting in the United States Navy, Rizzo served on the USS &quot;Houston&quot; cruiser for 19 months before being medically discharged due to diabetes insipidus. Returning to Philadelphia, Rizzo worked for Midvale Steel, helping manufacture naval guns in the lead-up to World War II. In 1942, Rizzo married Carmella Silvestri, and they had a son and a daughter. Their son, Frank Rizzo Jr., was a Republican member of the Philadelphia City Council from 1996 to 2012.

==Police commissioner==
Rizzo joined the Philadelphia Police Department (PPD) in 1943, rising through the ranks to become captain of the 19th district. In 1967, Rizzo was appointed commissioner by Mayor James Tate. Through various challenges, racial divisions in particular, facing the city, Tate continued to support Rizzo as police commissioner. He was boisterous and brooding, particularly to media. A biography of Rizzo, with an introduction written by future police commissioner John Timoney, recounted: &quot;Of one group of anti-police demonstrators, he is reported to have said, &#x27;Just wait: After November, you&#x27;ll have a front row seat because when I&#x27;m finished with them, I&#x27;ll make Attila the Hun look like a faggot.&#x27;&quot; A reporter who covered the Rizzo years, Andrea Mitchell, recounted routinely brutish behavior at the force as part of a broad pattern of Rizzo bravado.

Rizzo resigned as commissioner in 1971 to run for mayor.

===Relationship with Black Americans and police riots===
Rizzo&#x27;s relationship with Philadelphia&#x27;s Black community was volatile, with the PPD&#x27;s reputation suffering among Black people. During Rizzo&#x27;s tenure as division captain and commissioner, critics often charged that he was racially motivated, targeting activities in black neighborhoods.

It was during Rizzo&#x27;s tenure as deputy commissioner that Black and white officers assigned to the city&#x27;s predominantly Black neighborhoods worked in tandem in an attempt to reduce friction between civilians and police forces. As commissioner, Rizzo&#x27;s department had one of the largest percentages of black officers among large U.S. police departments, with 20% in 1968, at a time when other departments had little if any success in recruiting Black people.

However, hiring of Black officers declined sharply during Rizzo&#x27;s tenure as police commissioner. From 1966 to 1970, the percentage of Black police officers hired declined from 27.5% to 7.7%. This precipitated a decline in the overall proportion of Black Philadelphia police officers: from 21% in 1967 to 18% in 1971.

One of the force&#x27;s most widely publicized actions under Rizzo was raiding the Philadelphia offices of the Black Panther Party on August 31, 1970, one week before the Panthers planned to convene a &quot;People&#x27;s Revolutionary Convention&quot; at Temple University. The officers performed a strip-search on the arrested Black Panthers before cameras, after a Fairmount Park Police Officer had been murdered. The picture ran on the front page of the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; and was seen around the world. Days later the charges against the Panthers were dropped for lack of evidence. Subsequently, the search was ruled illegal. Four people unrelated to the Panthers were ultimately found guilty of the murder.

As mayor, Rizzo&#x27;s handling of the first MOVE incident in 1978 has been interpreted as supporting the charge of racism. When members of the group refused entrance to city inspectors, Rizzo evicted them through armed police action. Snipers were positioned around the house and the compound was blockaded by 1,000 police officers refusing any entry of food or water. When the police finally attempted to lay siege to the compound, officer James Ramp was killed in the conflict, and 16 other police and firefighters injured. Though MOVE members disagreed, it was claimed that Officer James Ramp was killed by MOVE gunfire. Eventually, the standoff was resolved without further loss of life, and the members of MOVE were arrested. One unarmed MOVE member, Delbert Africa, was beaten by multiple officers while leaving the MOVE house with his hands up. The incident as captured by the local news media shows Africa being dragged by his hair, struck with an officer&#x27;s helmet, and kicked in the face and groin once on the ground.

==Mayor of Philadelphia==
===Election to first term===

Although not being elected yet, Rizzo essentially functioned as mayor before the election, as Mayor James Tate had announced on television that he was retiring and naming Rizzo &quot;de facto&quot; mayor of Philadelphia. Asked if this was legal, Tate only laughed and replied that he was retiring. Rizzo finally ran for mayor in 1971. That year, he faced Democratic mayoral candidates Rep. William J. Green III, a former Democratic city chairman; State Rep. Hardy Williams; and former city councilman David Cohen. Cohen withdrew from the race and endorsed Green. Rizzo then defeated Green and Williams in the Democratic primary.

Running as a Democrat in the November 1971 election, Rizzo defeated former (and future) Councilman-at-Large and Chamber of Commerce President Thacher Longstreth. Unlike his opponents, Rizzo did not issue campaign position papers; he thought his slogan, &quot;firm but fair,&quot; sufficiently explained his expected role. Little animosity existed between the two candidates, and when Rizzo died suddenly during a later mayoral campaign in 1991, Longstreth wept.

===First term===
Rizzo was not without adversaries, even at the start of his first term. &quot;The Evening Bulletin&quot; interviewed former Mayor and School Board President Richardson Dilworth about allegations he made in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; that Rizzo had used the police for political espionage; Dilworth&#x27;s allegations launched a new and enduring feud between the two.

Grateful for the positive publicity local media had given him as police commissioner, Rizzo awarded jobs to two dozen local reporters. This quid pro quo caused suspicion and, more significantly, removed Rizzo&#x27;s most enthusiastic supporters from the media. The change in ownership of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; and &quot;Daily News&quot; also changed the bias of media coverage. The two newspapers had previously been owned by the Annenberg family, and both had given Commissioner Rizzo broad and favorable coverage. But the papers were sold to Knight Newspapers, later Knight Ridder. By the start of Rizzo&#x27;s first term, the staff of the &quot;Inquirer&quot;, friendly to Rizzo, had largely been supplanted by younger journalists, led by one of the nation&#x27;s most aggressive young editors, Eugene Roberts, formerly national editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Roberts and his staff emphasized investigative reporting, and the Rizzo administration, among other local institutions, was the subject of many critical stories by the Times.

A conservative Democrat, Rizzo supported the 1972 reelection campaign of Republican president Richard Nixon. Rizzo praised Nixon as, &quot;the greatest president this country [has] ever had.&quot; Rewarding Rizzo&#x27;s support, the victorious Nixon granted more federal funding to Philadelphia. But the action alienated many of Rizzo&#x27;s supporters in his own party. The Democratic city committee, Democrats on the city council, and party chairman Peter Camiel viewed Rizzo&#x27;s action as a betrayal.

====Lie detector scandal (1973)====
Rizzo clashed with the media well into his term. He held frequent press conferences in which he discussed matters in colorful and often bombastic language. After Camiel accused Rizzo of offering patronage in exchange for influencing the choice of candidates for district attorney and city comptroller, Rizzo called Camiel a liar. A reporter from the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; asked Rizzo if he would submit to a polygraph test to prove Camiel was lying. Rizzo agreed, as did Camiel. &quot;If this machine says a man lied, he lied,&quot; Rizzo famously said before the test. But the polygraph indicated that Rizzo had lied and Camiel had not. The scandal ended any hope Rizzo had of becoming governor. He discontinued his press conferences for nearly two years and attempted to rebuild his public support by appealing directly to voters.

===Election to second term===
In the 1975 Democratic primary, Rizzo defeated State Senator Louis G. Hill, Dilworth&#x27;s nephew, who was supported by Camiel. In the November election, Rizzo defeated independent candidate Charles Bowser, a leading black attorney and former City Councilman at Large, and Thomas M. Foglietta, who later represented a large portion of the city in Congress.

===Second term===

During Rizzo&#x27;s second term, black community activist and future Philadelphia Mayor W. Wilson Goode sued the city in federal court, alleging racial discrimination in the police and fire departments. The fire department was headed by Joseph Rizzo, the mayor&#x27;s brother. The suit led to the adoption of the influential &quot;Philadelphia Plan&quot;, calling for affirmative action in civil service hiring and promotions.

An interesting feature of Rizzo&#x27;s mayoralty was the establishment and mayor sanctioning of a publicly funded &quot;anti-defamation agency&quot; to combat pejorative remarks about Philadelphia. The agency&#x27;s best-publicized action was the boycott of S.O.S. Soap Pads, after a television commercial broadcast nationally referred to the city disparagingly. The manufacturer withdrew the offending commercial.

Construction began on The Gallery at Market East shopping mall and the Center City Commuter Connection, a commuter tunnel that connected and combined the city&#x27;s old and historically independent railroad systems, the Reading Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad.

The Philadelphia Gas Works, known locally as PGW, had been managed by a private company. During Rizzo&#x27;s tenure, it was taken over by the city. PGW then implemented senior citizens discounts and generous municipal labor contracts and expanded patronage hiring.

During Rizzo&#x27;s second term, two reporters at &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, William K. Marimow and Jon Neuman, began a long series about Philadelphia police department&#x27;s patterns of police brutality, intimidation, coercion and disregard for constitutional rights. The series won a Pulitzer Prize for the newspaper. This series was the basis of the 2000 film &quot;The Thin Blue Lie&quot;, in which Rizzo was portrayed by Paul Sorvino.

===Tax increase and recall attempt===

In his successful second mayoral campaign in 1975, Rizzo campaigned under the slogan, &quot;He held the line on taxes&quot;. Soon after the election, he persuaded City Council to increase the city&#x27;s wage tax from 3.31% to 4.31%, one of the highest in the nation. The action infuriated Rizzo&#x27;s opponents and led fiscal conservatives to join them in attempting to recall Rizzo from the mayor&#x27;s office. Americans for Democratic Action, the liberal activist group that had played a key role in moving Philadelphia from Republican to Democratic control in the late 1940s and early 1950s, gathered the 250,000 signatures required. Polls showed Rizzo losing by a wide margin. Rizzo&#x27;s allies counterattacked by challenging the validity of the signatures as well as the recall procedure itself. Then the Pennsylvania Supreme Court declared the Charter&#x27;s recall provision unconstitutional by one vote. The decision was written by Chief Justice Robert N. C. Nix Jr., elected to the court with Rizzo&#x27;s support in 1971.

Rizzo opponents, while greatly disheartened, elected Edward G. Rendell as district attorney in 1977 and organized a campaign to elect anti-Rizzo Democratic committee persons and elected officials in the 1978 primaries.

===Attempt for third consecutive term===
Facing Philadelphia&#x27;s two consecutive term limit, Rizzo persuaded the Philadelphia City Council to place a charter change question on the ballot in 1978 that would have allowed him to run for a third consecutive term in 1979. In a record turnout for a Philadelphia municipal election, Philadelphians voted two to one against the change, blocking Rizzo from running in 1979. In that election, Republican gubernatorial candidate Dick Thornburgh won a larger-than-expected percentage of the black vote (for a Republican) and the governorship against a heavily favored Democratic opponent. The anti-charter change organization would soon support a &quot;Clean Sweep&quot; ticket for municipal offices in 1979, including former Rep. William J. Green III, who was elected mayor. Later on Rizzo tried to run again; this time his main Democratic opponent was the first black mayor of Philadelphia, Wilson Goode. During this run he tried to connect more with Philadelphia&#x27;s black population, which proved ineffectual as he won only three percent of the black vote and lost to Goode in a closely contested election.

===Historical assessment===
A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago saw Rizzo ranked as the fifth-worst American big-city mayor to serve between the years 1820 and 1993. When the survey was limited only to mayors that were in office post-1960, the results saw Rizzo ranked as the absolute worst.

Rizzo&#x27;s mayoralty has received retrospective criticism for his alleged racism and the police brutality that took place under his watch.

==Lawsuits==
Rizzo&#x27;s police department, Rizzo&#x27;s mayoral administration, and Rizzo personally faced dozens of lawsuits alleging abuses ranging from physical assault to systemic discrimination and harassment, culminating in Philadelphia&#x27;s first mayoral recall effort. A 1968 lawsuit charged Rizzo and the Fairmount Parks commission in a class action suit, alleging targeted harassment of &quot;hippies&quot; in Rittenhouse Square. In 1973, a police accountability group alleged Rizzo&#x27;s responsibility in systemic police discrimination and harassment of Philadelphia minority communities, seeking the establishment of a civilian oversight organization. Another 1973 civil rights action charged Rizzo with assault and conspiracy against political protestors in activities related to his mayoral campaign.

Rizzo was also named in a protracted court battle over Whitman Park, a bitterly contested public housing project in South Philadelphia. Upon taking office in 1971, Mayor Rizzo famously proclaimed that Whitman Park would never be built. Rizzo ultimately lost in court in 1979, as Federal District Judge Raymond J. Broderick cited racist motivations in blocking the project.

==Post-mayoral career==

Between 1983 and 1986, Rizzo served as a security consultant at the Philadelphia Gas Works, controversially, as he drew a city pension at the same time, and hosted one of Philadelphia&#x27;s most popular radio talk shows, a tradition later emulated by his son, Republican City Councilman Frank Rizzo Jr.

In 1980, Rizzo vandalized an NBC KYW-TV camera while they were stationed in a van outside his house in Chestnut Hill. He was surrounded by several police officers who did nothing to restrain him. When KYW reporter Stan Bohrman tried to interview him later over the incident, Rizzo offered to fight him and repeatedly called him a &quot;crumb bum&quot; and a &quot;crumb creep lush coward&quot;.

He ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for mayor in 1983, losing to Wilson Goode, who in turn won the mayoral election. In 1986, he became a Republican and ran in the mayoral election of 1987, once again losing to Goode, 49% to 51%.
In 1991, he set out to run for mayor again. He won the Republican primary against former Philadelphia District Attorney (and later chief justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court) Ronald D. Castille.

==Death==
During his 1991 mayoral campaign against the Democratic candidate, former District Attorney (and later two-term Pennsylvania Governor) Edward G. Rendell, Rizzo suffered a fatal heart attack at his campaign headquarters on July 16 at around 1:15 p.m. EDT, and was pronounced dead at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital at 2:12 p.m., at the age of 70.

Joseph M. Egan Jr. then replaced Rizzo as the Republican nominee. Rendell went on to win the November election and served two terms as mayor.

==Funeral and memorials==

Rizzo&#x27;s funeral was purported to be the largest in the history of Philadelphia, with people lining the streets of the motorcade from the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul to the cemetery. He was interred at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania.

In his hometown neighborhood of South Philadelphia, a mural portrait of Rizzo was located at the Italian Market on Ninth Street. The mural had been described as &quot;Philadelphia&#x27;s most commonly defaced piece of public art&quot;. The mural was painted over on June 7, 2020, at the request of Mural Arts, a nonprofit that maintained the mural.

A statue of Mayor Rizzo waving in greeting, created by sculptor Zenos Frudakis, used to stand in front of Philadelphia&#x27;s Municipal Services Building. The statue was paid for by private contributions. Following the aftermath of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Councilwoman Helen Gym posted on Twitter, &quot;All around the country, we&#x27;re fighting to remove the monuments to slavery &amp; racism. Philly, we have work to do. Take the Rizzo statue down&quot;. Gym&#x27;s comments started a public debate about the future of the Rizzo statue and mural. Mayor Jim Kenney was open to the possibility, stating that &quot;it is time to discuss the future&quot; of the monument. On November 4, 2017, Mayor Kenney announced that the statue would be moved to a new location, though it subsequently remained in place. In May 2020, the statue was vandalized during protests in response to the murder of George Floyd. Days later on the night of June 2, the statue was removed. Mayor Jim Kenney stated &quot;The statue is a deplorable monument to racism, bigotry, and police brutality for members of the black community, the LGBTQ community, and many others. The treatment of these communities under Mr. Rizzo&#x27;s leadership was among the worst periods in Philadelphia&#x27;s history.&quot;

Rizzo was portrayed in &quot;The Thin Blue Lie&quot; by Paul Sorvino, &quot;The Irishman&quot; by Gino Cafarelli and The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer by Louis Di Bianco. Rizzo is also the model and inspiration behind the Jerry Carlucci character in the &quot;Badge of Honor&quot; book series.

==Bibliography==
&quot;The Cop Who Would Be King&quot;, by &quot;Philadelphia Bulletin&quot; journalists Joseph R. Daughen and Peter Binzen, is widely considered the most authoritative account of Frank Rizzo&#x27;s rise to power. In 1993, sports journalist Sal Paolantonio wrote a book about Rizzo entitled &quot;Rizzo: The Last Big Man In Big City America&quot;. In 2015 the play &quot;Rizzo&quot; by Bruce Graham based on Paolantonio&#x27;s book premiered at Theatre Exile in Philadelphia. More critical comments on Rizzo&#x27;s tenure as police commissioner and mayor are found in Andrea Mitchell&#x27;s book &quot;Talking Back&quot;. Phyllis Kaniss&#x27; &quot;The Media and the Mayor&#x27;s Race&quot; is an analysis of local journalistic coverage of Rizzo&#x27;s last campaign; it describes the tactics he used against Castille and planned to use against Rendell.

Timothy J. Lombardo&#x27;s book &quot;Blue-Collar Conservatism: Frank Rizzo&#x27;s Philadelphia and Populist Politics&quot; (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2018) offers a serious examination of Rizzo&#x27;s career and the rise of blue-collar conservatism in the late 20th century.

<doc id="470238" wikidata="Q685282" url="?curid=470238" title="Help America Vote Act">
<text>The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (Pub. L.Tooltip Public Law (United States)107–252 (text) (PDF)), or HAVA, is a United States federal law, which was authored by Christopher Dodd, and passed in the House 357-48 and 92–2 in the Senate and was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 29, 2002. The bill was drafted (at least in part) in reaction to the controversy surrounding the 2000 U.S. presidential election, when the Supreme Court narrowly ruled that Bush was the president. The necessity for this ruling stemmed from controversies surrounding the validity of the election and whether votes were cast in a fair and equitable manner. The main point of contention surrounding the perceived unfairness was due to the millions of votes that were not represented due to mechanical errors or errors due to the manner in which the ballots were cast.

The goals of HAVA are to:

* replace punchcard and lever-based voting systems;
* create the Election Assistance Commission to assist in the administration of federal elections; and
* establish minimum election administration standards.

HAVA mandates that all states and localities upgrade many aspects of their election procedures, including their voting machines, registration processes and poll worker training. The specifics of implementation have been left up to each state, which allows for varying interpretations of the federal law.

==Provisions==

===State plan and reporting===
To be eligible for federal funding, states must submit a plan describing how payments will be used and distributed, provisions for voter education and poll worker training, how to adopt voting system guidelines, performance measures to determine success (including goals, timetables, responsibilities, and criteria), administrative complaint procedures, and the committee who helped develop the state plan.

Each year the state receives federal funding they must submit a report to the EAC detailing a list of expenditures, the number of and types of voting equipment obtained with the funds, and an analysis and description of the activities funded.

===Accessibility===

====Polling place====
The Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to make payments to state and local governments for making polling places‒including path of travel, entrances, exits, and voting areas‒accessible to individuals with disabilities, including the blind and visually impaired, in a manner that provides the same opportunity for access and participation (including privacy and independence) as for other voters; and providing individuals with disabilities and others with information about the accessibility of polling places, including outreach programs to inform the individuals about the availability of accessible polling places and training election officials, poll workers, and election volunteers on how best to promote the access and participation of individuals with disabilities in elections for Federal office.

====Voting systems====
HAVA requires each polling location have at least one voting system accessible to individuals with disabilities, including nonvisual accessibility for the blind and visually impaired, in a manner that provides the same opportunity for access and participation (including privacy and independence) as for other voters.

===Computerized statewide voter registration===
HAVA requires states develop a single, uniform, official, centralized, interactive computerized statewide voter registration list defined, maintained, and administered at the State level. (Previously, voter registration lists could be maintained solely by local officials.) HAVA requires the statewide list be coordinated with other agency databases within the state. HAVA also requires regular &quot;maintenance&quot; of the statewide list including removing ineligible voters and duplicate names are eliminated in accordance with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA).

===Voter identification===
HAVA requires that first-time voters who registered by mail, and have not previously voted in a federal election in the State, to present a form of identification to the appropriate State or local election official before or on election day. The ID may be either a current and valid photo identification or a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document that shows the name and address of the voter. Voters who submitted any of these forms of identification during registration are exempt, as are voters entitled to vote by absentee ballot under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. The ID requirement applies to in person and vote by mail voters. In the case of a vote by mail voter, a copy of the ID must be submitted with the ballot. A State may enact further ID requirements which aren&#x27;t specified under HAVA.

===Provisional voting===
HAVA requires voters identified as ineligible (such as voters not found on the registered list), but who believe themselves to be eligible, to be able to cast a provisional ballot. After the election, the appropriate State or local election entity will determine if the voter was eligible, if so counting the vote and notify the voter of the outcome. Approximately 1.9 million voters nationwide cast provisional ballots in the 2004 election. Of those, approximately 1.2 million—or 64.5%—were counted.
Additionally, any time polling hours are extended voters are required to vote using provisional ballots. Further, voters who do not comply with HAVA&#x27;s voter identification requirements are able to cast a provisional ballot.

===Election Assistance Commission===
HAVA created the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), an independent agency of the United States government. The EAC is responsible for holding hearings, functioning as a clearinghouse for election administration information, creating a testing and certification program for voting systems, providing voluntary guidance to states, and administering HAVA grant programs. The EAC has no rulemaking authority other than that permitted by the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA). Any action taken by the EAC requires approval of at least three commissioners

====Commissioners====
The Election Assistance Commission includes four commissioners (2 Democrats and 2 Republicans) appointed by the President and subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. Commissioners are recommended by House and Senate leadership. HAVA requires all commissioners have experience with or expertise in election administration or the study of elections.

====Staff====
Staff of the EAC will consist of at least an executive director and a general counsel.

====Annual report====
Not later than January 31 of each year, the EAC is required to submit an annual report to Congress detailing activities related to HAVA programs including grants or other payments and all votes taken by commissioners.

===Voting machines===
HAVA requires states to use funding allocated by the federal government to replace punched card voting systems or lever voting systems with new systems in accordance with HAVA&#x27;s voting system standards.The funding amounted to $325 million, allowing $4,000 to be given to every precinct to further the effort of unifying voting systems.

===Voting systems standards===
HAVA sets forth requirements for all voting systems, including that they:

* permit the voter to verify (in a private and independent manner) the votes selected by the voter on the ballot before the ballot is cast and counted;
* provide the voter with the opportunity (in a private and independent manner) to change the ballot or correct any error before the ballot is cast and counted (including the opportunity to correct the error through the issuance of a replacement ballot if the voter was otherwise unable to change the ballot or correct any error); and
* notify the voter of overvotes (votes for more than the maximum number of selections allowed in a contest) and provide the voter a chance to correct these errors.

States that do not use electronic equipment to assist voters with detecting errors must:

* establish a voter education program, specific to that voting system, that notifies each voter of the effect of casting multiple votes for an office; and
* provide the voter with instructions on how to correct the ballot before it is cast and counted.

HAVA further requires that any required notification preserve the privacy of the voter and the secrecy of the ballot; and that alternative-language accessibility be available pursuant to the requirements of section 203 of the Voting Rights Act.

====Auditing====
HAVA requires all voting systems be auditable and produce a permanent paper record with a manual audit capacity available as an official record for any recount conducted.

====Voluntary Voting System Guidelines====
HAVA tasks the EAC with creating and maintaining the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG).

====Research and development====
The EAC is responsible for making grants to entities in carrying out research and development to improve the quality, reliability, accuracy, accessibility, affordability, and security of voting equipment, election systems, and voting technology. HAVA requires the National Institute of Standards and Technology annually recommend areas for research.

====Implementation timelines and challenges====
Responses to these requirements varied by state, but a widespread effect has been the purchasing of electronic voting machines, including DRE voting machines. There are criticisms of the reliability and security of these machines.

; Continued purchasing of non-compliant machines
Some electronic voting machines sold through 2005, including those by Diebold Election Systems, did not meet the requirements of HAVA and were not required to be in compliance until January 1, 2006. Concerns were raised that as late as 2005, vendors were selling non-compliant machines to unwitting states and counties who believed that they were HAVA-compliant. Unless vendors offered a specific guarantee of HAVA compliance, equipment may have required scrapping or retrofitting at taxpayers&#x27; expense after January 1, 2006.

; Timelines not met
Compliance with HAVA provisions and timelines was not met in every state, both because of the difficulty of identifying and certifying reliable HAVA compliant voting machines and due to political and bureaucratic delays. A February 2006 report from Election Data Services found that 124 counties reported still using punched card voting systems in the 2006 election (down from 566 in 2000); similarly, lever machines had decreased from 434 counties in 2000 to 119 in 2006, with New York state accounting for more than half the total number of counties still using lever machines. In 2006, 69 million voters used optical scan voting machines, while another 66 million used DRE voting machines, while 11 million were offered multiple options as part of a mixed system.

===Establishing student programs===
HAVA establishes three programs for students, one to recruit college students as pollworkers, one to recruit high school students, and one to provide grants for the National Student and Parent Mock Election, a national nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that works to promote voter participation in American elections to enable it to carry out voter education activities for students and their parents.

===Military members and overseas citizens===
HAVA mandates changes improving the access of military and overseas citizens, including requiring:

* the Secretary of Defense to implement measures to ensure that a postmark or other official proof of mailing date is provided on each absentee ballot collected at any overseas location or vessel at sea;
* the secretary of each military department to ensure that all military and their families have easy access to voting information;
* each state to designate a single office for providing information to overseas voters; and
* each state to inform overseas voters of why any application for registration is rejected.

==Criticisms==
Criticisms of HAVA center around mandated changes in voting technology, voter identification, confusion and voter intimidation, misappropriation of federal funds, and unnecessarily complicating the voter registration process.

The legislative director of the League of Women Voters of the United States, Lloyd J. Leonard, expressed doubts about the bill. He claimed that the bill could disenfranchise voters by purging them from the rolls and by establishing confusing new identification requirements.

===Criticisms of electronic voting machines===
A Pennsylvania court ruled in April 2007 that voting machine certification was the result of what Judge Rochelle Friedman called &quot;deficient examination criteria&quot; which &quot;do not approximate those that are customary in the information technology industry for systems that require a high level of security&quot;. The court ruled that voters have a right under the commonwealth&#x27;s constitution to reliable and secure voting systems and can challenge the use of electronic voting machines &quot;that provide no way for Electors to know whether their votes will be recognized&quot; through voter verification or independent audit.

===ID requirements===

The ACLU was critical of the &quot;highly complicated new identification requirements&quot;. They said the requirement for the voter&#x27;s driver license number or the last four digits of the social security number was an invasion of privacy and could increase identity theft. The ACLU described the requirement for a photo ID as a &quot;poll tax&quot; on citizens who would be required to purchase a photo ID if they did not already have one. The legislated offers some alternatives to photo ID such as utility bill or government assistance letter, but the ACLU says some classes of persons, like battered women, may not have access to these documents. In the end, ID requirements were included as a part of the bill after a compromise was made and it was accepted in the Senate by a vote of 99-1. 

===Misappropriation of funds===
The bill has also come under fire for the fact that the majority of the billions of dollars allocated to the states for HAVA has been for increased access for disabled voters, while the main goal of HAVA, avoiding the problems that plagued the 2000 elections in Florida, may have not been adequately served.

===Complicating voter registration===
Critics also state that the bill contains some elements that complicate the voter registration process. For example, Section 303(a)(5) of HAVA provides that no state may accept or process a voter registration form for an election for Federal office unless the application includes &quot;in the case of an applicant who has been issued a current and valid driver&#x27;s license, the applicant&#x27;s driver&#x27;s license number&quot;. Critics contend that it costs the country millions of dollars just to process the same basic registration form and confirm that they meet the HAVA requirements.

===Partisan differences in implementation===
According to a study of the HAVA-based reforms, the states differed along partisan lines in introducing improvements: &quot;[T]he partisan make-up of state government frequently influenced the fate of these reforms. States with a divided government or high party competition tended not to adopt several key electoral reforms, while partisanship and the interaction of partisanship and minority representation influenced the adoption of others. Fiscal constraints and institutional arrangements had less impact on reform adoption. Overall, our findings suggest that electoral reforms were shaped more by political factors than by fiscal concerns or any objective need for reform.&quot;

<doc id="470244" wikidata="Q155820" url="?curid=470244" title="Constitutional Democratic Party">
<text>The Constitutional Democratic Party (, K-D), also called Constitutional Democrats and formally the Party of People&#x27;s Freedom (), was a political party in the Russian Empire that promoted Western constitutional monarchy—among other policies—and attracted a base ranging from moderate conservatives to mild socialists. Party members were called Kadets (or Cadets) from the abbreviation K-D of the party name. Konstantin Kavelin&#x27;s and Boris Chicherin&#x27;s writings formed the theoretical basis of the party&#x27;s platform. Historian Pavel Miliukov was the party&#x27;s leader throughout its existence.

The Kadets&#x27; base of support were primarily intellectuals and professionals; university professors and lawyers were particularly prominent within the party. Many Kadet party members were veterans of the zemstvo, local councils. The Constitutional Democratic Party formed from the merger of several liberal groupings, namely the Union of Liberation, the Union of Zemstvo Constitutionalists and the Union of Unions as well as the organization of bourgeois professionals and intellectuals, including teachers, lawyers, writers, physicians and engineers.

The Kadets&#x27; liberal economic program favored the workers&#x27; right to an eight-hour day and the right to take strike action. The Kadets &quot;were unwaveringly committed to full citizenship for all of Russia&#x27;s minorities&quot; and supported Jewish emancipation. The party drew significant support from Jews until 1916, and Volga Germans and a significant number of each group were active party members. On the other hand, the Kadets adhered to Russian nationalism as they largely based their identity on &quot;Russian nation&quot; or the &quot;Russian people&quot; as something opposed to the state bureaucracy; since 1905, they drifted towards statism, and their views on foreign politics were based on the view of international politics as a &quot;national struggle&quot;, and they generally advocated for Russian imperialism, describing Russians as &quot;Staatsvolk&quot;, and the Russian Empire as their nation-state. However, they differed from the hardline ethnocentric Russian nationalists, as they understood Russians rather as a political identity and defended the rights of ethnic minorities and nations of Russia to have cultural authonomies and to enter the Russian nation. Such views and Pan-Slavism, which they shared with the other moderate right-wing parties, drove them into very hostile attitude towards Germany and Austria-Hungary during the World War I, and by 1917, they were strongly nationalist and defensist; during the Russian Civil War, they became proponents of military dictatorship and territorial integrity of the Russian Empire, and were the strongest supporters of the Whites next to the nationalist parties.

== Radical origins (1905–1906) ==
The Constitutional Democratic Party was formed in Moscow on 12–18 October 1905 at the height of the Russian Revolution of 1905 when Tsar Nicholas II was forced to sign the October Manifesto granting basic civil liberties. The Kadets were to the immediate left of the Octobrists, another new formed party organized at the same time. Unlike the Octobrists, who were committed to constitutional monarchy from the start, the Kadets were at first ambiguous on the subject, demanding universal suffrage (including women&#x27;s suffrage) and a Constituent Assembly that would determine the country&#x27;s form of government. This radicalism was despite the fact 60% of Kadets were nobles. The Kadets were one of the parties invited by the reform-minded Prime Minister Sergei Witte to join his cabinet in October–November 1905, but the negotiations broke down over the Kadets&#x27; radical demands and Witte&#x27;s refusal to drop notorious reactionaries like Petr Nikolayevich Durnovo from the cabinet.

With some socialist and revolutionary parties boycotting the election to the First Duma in February 1906, the Kadets received 37% of the urban vote and won over 30% of the seats in the Duma. They interpreted their electoral win as a mandate and allied with the left-leaning peasant Trudovik faction, forming a majority in the Duma. When their declaration of legislative intent was rejected by the government at the start of the parliamentary session in April, they adopted a radical oppositionist line, denouncing the government at every opportunity. On 9 July, the government announced that the Duma was dysfunctional and dissolved it. In response, 120 Kadet and 80 Trudovik and Social Democrat deputies went to in Vyborg, Finland (and thus beyond the reach of Russian police) and responded with the Vyborg Manifesto (or the &quot;Vyborg Appeal&quot;), written by Miliukov. In the manifesto, they called for passive resistance, non-payment of taxes and draft avoidance. The appeal failed to have an effect on the population at large and proved both ineffective and counterproductive, leading to a ban on its authors, including the entire Kadet leadership, from participation in future Dumas. This was further accentuated by the force of the tsar trying to control and deteriorate the power of the Duma.

It was not until later in 1906, with the revolution in retreat, that the Kadets abandoned revolutionary and republican aspirations and declared their support for a constitutional monarchy. The government remained suspicious of the Kadets until the fall of the monarchy in 1917. Finnish liberal politician and professor of jurisdiction and politology Leo Mechelin was expelled 1903–1904 when the Kadets were preparing to form a party. Mechelin cooperated with them and wrote them a liberal constitution for Russia to be enforced when they would get into power. At the time of Vyborg Manifesto, Mechelin was already the leader of the Finnish government, or &quot;Mechelin&#x27;s senate&quot; (1905–1908), which implemented the universal right to vote and freedoms of expression, press, congregation and association.

== Parliamentary opposition (1906–1917) ==
When the Second Duma was convened on 20 February 1907, the Kadets found themselves in a difficult position. Their leadership was not represented in the Duma after the Vyborg Manifesto fiasco and their numbers were reduced to about 100. Although still the largest faction in the Duma, they no longer dominated the parliament and their attempts to concentrate on lawmaking were frustrated by radicals on the left and on the right who saw the Duma as a propaganda tool. Although the Kadets had moderated their position in the Second Duma, they refused to vote in May 1907 for a resolution denouncing revolutionary violence which gave the government of Pyotr Stolypin a pretext to dissolve the Second Duma on 3 June 1907 and change the electoral law to drastically limit the representation of leftist and liberal parties.

Due to the changes in the electoral law, the Kadets were reduced to a relatively small (54 seats) opposition group in the Third Duma (1907–1912). Although excluded from the more important Duma committees, the Kadets were not entirely powerless and could determine the outcome of certain votes when allied with the centrist Octobrist faction against right-wing nationalist deputies. With the revolution crushed by 1908, they moderated their position even further as they voted to denounce revolutionary violence, no longer sought confrontation with the government and concentrated on influencing legislation whenever possible. By 1909, Miliukov could claim that the Kadets were now &quot;the opposition of His Majesty, not the opposition to His Majesty&quot;, which caused only moderate dissent among the left-leaning faction of the party.

Although the Kadets, allied with the Progressive faction and the Octobrists, were able to push some liberal bills (religious freedoms, freedom of the press and of the labor unions) through the Duma, the bills were either diluted by the upper house of the parliament or vetoed by the tsar. The failure of their legislative program further discredited the Kadets&#x27; strategy of peaceful change through gradual reform.

In 1910, the government rekindled its pre-revolutionary Russification campaign in an attempt to restrict minority rights, notably drastically curtailing Finland&#x27;s autonomy. Most Kadets were opposed to these policies and allied with the left-wing of the Octobrists tried to blunt them as much as possible, but they were unsuccessful. However, a minority of Kadets headed by Pyotr Struve supported a moderate version of Russification, which threatened to split the party. With the increase in popular discontent after the Lena massacre on 4 April 1912 and a continuous decline in party membership after 1906, the rift in the party became more pronounced. Kadet leaders on the left like Central Committee member Nikolai Vissarionovich Nekrasov argued that the Duma experience had been a failure and that &quot;constructive work&quot; was pointless under an autocratic government. Kadet leaders on the right like Central Committee members Vasily Maklakov, Mikhail Chelnokov, Nikolai Gredeskul and Ariadna Tyrkova-Williams argued for a shift to the right. The disagreements were temporarily put aside in July 1914 at the outbreak of World War I when the Kadets unconditionally supported the government and found an outlet for their energies in various kinds of relief work under the umbrella of the All-Russian Union of Zemstvos and the All-Russian Union of Cities.

Once the initial outburst of national unity feelings died down in mid-1915 as Russian retreat from Galicia showed the government&#x27;s incompetence, the Kadets, together with the Progressive faction, the Octobrist faction and a part of the Nationalist faction in the Duma, formed the Progressive Bloc in August 1915 which was critical of the government&#x27;s prosecution of the war and demanded a government of &quot;popular confidence&quot;. As Russia&#x27;s defeats in the war multiplied, the Kadets&#x27; opposition became more pronounced, culminating in Miliukov&#x27;s speech in the Duma in October 1916 when he all but accused government ministers of treason.

== 1917 Revolution ==

During the February Revolution of 1917, Kadet deputies in the Duma and other prominent Kadets formed the core of the newly formed Russian Provisional Government with five portfolios. Although exercising limited power in a situation known as dual power, the Provisional Government immediately attempted to deal with issues of the many nationalities in the Russian Empire. They introduced legislation abolishing all limitations based on religion and nationality and introduced an element of self-determination by transferring power from governors-general to local representatives. They issued a decree recognising Polish autonomy, more as a symbolic gesture in light of the German occupation of this territory. However, this tendency was limited as most of the ministers feared a break up of the empire. One of the Kadet leaders, Prince Lvov, became Prime Minister and Miliukov became Russia&#x27;s Foreign Minister. A radical party just 11 years earlier, after the February Revolution the Kadets occupied the rightmost end of the political spectrum since all monarchist parties had been dissolved and the Kadets were the only openly functioning non-socialist party remaining.

The Kadets&#x27; position in the Provisional Government was compromised when Miliukov&#x27;s promise to the Entente allies to continue the war (18 April) was made public on 26 April. The resulting government crisis led to Miliukov&#x27;s resignation and a power-sharing agreement with moderate socialist parties on 4–5 May. The Kadets&#x27; position was further eroded during the July crisis when they resigned from the government in protest against concessions to the Ukrainian independence movement. The coalition was reformed later in July under Alexander Kerensky and survived yet another government crisis in early September. Sergei Fedorovich Oldenburg was Minister of Education and served briefly as chair of the short-lived Commission on Nationality Affairs. The Kadets had become a liability for their socialist coalition partners and an evidence of the treason of the moderated socialists, exposed by Bolshevik propaganda. By the summer of 1917, many prominent Kadets were supporters of Lavr Kornilov during the Kornilov affair.

With the Bolshevik seizure of power on 25–26 October and subsequent transfer of political power to the Soviets, Kadet and other anti-Bolshevik newspapers were closed down and the party was suppressed by the new regime because of its support for Kornilov and Kaledin.

== Russian Civil War and decline (1918–1940) ==
After the Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War, most of the Kadet leadership was forced to emigrate and continued publishing newspapers abroad (&quot;Vozrojdénie&quot;) until World War II. However, Oldenburg negotiated a working relationship between the Russian Academy of Science and the Bolsheviks, signing an agreement that the Academy supported the Soviet State in February 1918.

== Refoundation ==
A party called Constitutional Democratic Party – Party of Popular Freedom was founded in the then-Russian SFSR in 1990 and based on the program of the historical Kadet party. However, the party soon drifted into hardline nationalist politics and joined the national-communist National Salvation Front and supported the Supreme Soviet against President Yeltsin.

<doc id="470246" wikidata="Q6273447" url="?curid=470246" title="Jonathan Hunt (New Zealand politician)">
<text>Jonathan Lucas Hunt (2 December 1938 – 8 March 2024) was a New Zealand politician and diplomat. He started a 38-year parliamentary career as the Baby of the House and retired as Father of the House. During that tenure, he was Speaker of the House of Representatives. Afterwards, he served as New Zealand&#x27;s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 2005 to March 2008. He was a member of the Order of New Zealand, New Zealand&#x27;s highest civilian honour, and given the nickname &quot;Minister for Wine and Cheese&quot; for enjoying those items.

==Early life==
Hunt was born in Lower Hutt, but grew up in Palmerston North. He had a twin brother, David, who died four days after they were born. Hunt&#x27;s father was a child welfare officer, reassigned to the Manawatu in 1942. Hunt was educated at Palmerston North Boys&#x27; High School and later Auckland Grammar School; later he enrolled at the University of Auckland, where he gained a BA (Hons) degree in history.

In 1958, Hunt was elected editor of the Auckland University Students&#x27; Association&#x27;s (AUSA) Craccum magazine for the 1959 year. While at University Hunt is also credited with founding the Princes Street Labour branch. He was a &#x27;radio quiz kid&#x27; and in 1963 he toured South-East Asia with a Rotary group of Young New Zealanders.

After graduating, Hunt became a History, English and Latin teacher from 1961 to 1966 at Kelston Boys High School in West Auckland where he also coached cricket. He was then a university tutor. Hunt also had a long-standing relationship with the Department of Political Studies at the University, which for many years has collected and archived Hunt&#x27;s personal and professional papers. Hunt lived in Karekare on Auckland&#x27;s west coast and he was well known for his passionate interest in the sport of cricket. He was the secretary of the Auckland Secondary Schools&#x27; Cricket Association.

==Member of Parliament==





In 1966 at age 27, Hunt was offered to replace the retiring Rex Mason in Auckland&#x27;s New Lynn electorate. This being a safe Labour electorate, Hunt was effectively given a seat in parliament, and he became the Baby of the House as the only MP still in their 20s. Hunt was to later write a biography of Mason for the &quot;Dictionary of New Zealand Biography&quot;. He remained MP for New Lynn until 1996, when he became a list MP after losing in Tamaki to National&#x27;s Clem Simich. Hunt was returned twice more as a list MP; losing to National&#x27;s Brian Neeson in the and as a list-only candidate in the .

In mid-January 1970, United States Vice President Spiro Agnew visited Wellington. Hunt along with several other Labour Members of Parliament including Bob Tizard, Arthur Faulkner and Martyn Finlay boycotted the state dinner to protest American policy in Vietnam. Other Labour MPs, including Opposition Leader Norman Kirk attended the function which dealt with the Nixon Doctrine.

Hunt was appointed junior government whip upon Labour&#x27;s victory in . He was later promoted further in 1974 by Prime Minister Bill Rowling to the position of Chairman of Committees. As Chairman of Committees he had the responsibility of deputising for the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the 67 year old Stan Whitehead. Whitehead was in ill-health and Hunt acted on his behalf more than he had expected to. When Whitehead suffered a heart attack in the last parliamentary session of 1975 Hunt was nearly drafted to replace him as Speaker, though Whitehead was to make a recovery. Hunt was a contributor to major parliamentary reforms which saw Parliamentary Service and the Office of the Clerk of the New Zealand House of Representatives were separated.

After the shock defeat of the Rowling government in the 1975 general election, Hunt was appointed to Rowling&#x27;s shadow cabinet and designated as Shadow Minister of Health in 1976. He left the shadow cabinet, at his own request, in 1979 with the intention of setting himself up to become Speaker of the House should Labour win the next election. Labour did not win and in the next parliamentary term he was senior whip and Shadow Minister of Broadcasting.

===Cabinet Minister===
During the Fourth Labour Government he served as Postmaster-General, Minister of Broadcasting, Minister of Tourism and Minister of Housing. He had chaired the caucus committee on restructuring the broadcasting industry in 1973 which was uncompleted. On becoming Minister of Broadcasting in 1984, he said the idea would not be resurrected but reaffirmed his intention to fulfil Labour&#x27;s manifesto to establish a Maori and Pacific Island radio station, ban commercials on the concert and national radio programmes and aiding the establishment of privately owned television stations. Hunt worked on the Adult Adoption Information Act 1985, which enabled adults who were adopted as children to find out who their birth parents were as well as allowing birth mothers to learn about their adopted adult children. In the Tourism portfolio he was deeply involved with restructuring New Zealand&#x27;s wine industry, which laid the foundation for New Zealand&#x27;s global reputation for good quality wine. As Postmaster-General the New Zealand Post Office was heavily affected by the government&#x27;s free-market reforms. The government closed 432 post offices with mass staff layoffs which caused community outrage. Hunt was loath to implement such reforms, seeing them as a contradiction to Labour Party ideology. His reluctance to make such decisions meant that Stan Rodger, the Minister of State Services, ended up deciding on them.

After the , the cabinet was reshuffled in which he lost the broadcasting and Postmaster-General portfolios and instead designated Leader of the House. This left him without a department to administer which saw his salary reduced by $19,200 per annum, leading to opposition leader Jim Bolger to label Hunt&#x27;s position as &quot;sinecure&quot;, much to Hunt&#x27;s displeasure. He eventually was given extra portfolios of tourism, housing and broadcasting during the course of the term. During his second period as Broadcasting minister he followed through with his pledge in aiding the establishment of privately owned television stations. He approved the licence for TV3, New Zealand&#x27;s first commercial television channel, to begin operations in November 1989. He was responsible for the passing of the Broadcasting Act 1989 which established NZ On Air, an organisation responsible for funding support for local broadcasting and creative works.

During the divisions of the Fourth Labour Government&#x27;s second term, Hunt generally supported Prime Minister David Lange over the finance minister Roger Douglas. Hunt was famed for his kindness and willingness to accommodate conflicting points of view. He was described by Douglas ally Richard Prebble as the &quot;20 stone straw in the wind&quot; in reference to both his weight and agreeableness. In 1989, Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer nominated Hunt a member of the Privy Council in recognition of his long service to Parliament.

Upon the retirement of Sir Robert Muldoon, Hunt was the longest-serving member of Parliament between 1991 and 2005, earning him the unofficial title of &#x27;Father of the House&#x27;. He assumed the title of &#x27;father&#x27; to the delight of colleagues given his status as a lifelong bachelor.

In opposition again from 1990, Hunt was senior opposition whip, Shadow Leader of the House and Shadow Minister of Housing under leader Mike Moore. Hunt supported Helen Clark in her successful leadership bid against Moore, after which he remained senior whip and Shadow Leader of the House.

===Speaker of the House of Representatives===
Hunt was elected Speaker unopposed when the fifth Labour government came to power in 1999. Hunt had previously served as Chairman of Committees from 1974 to 1975 which had since been rebranded as the Deputy-Speaker. Hunt became the eighth Chairman of Committees to later serve as Speaker. He retained his position following the election in 2002 serving in total as Speaker for six years from 1999–2005. Clark believed Hunt as a good speaker who had an impeccable knowledge of standing orders and parliamentary procedures. He also had good strong working relationship with the Clerk of the House, David McGee, and together ran a &quot;pretty tight ship.&quot;

==High Commissioner to the United Kingdom==
In December 2004, it was announced that he would retire from politics and replace Russell Marshall as New Zealand High Commissioner in London, a move that had long been anticipated. He was replaced as Speaker by Margaret Wilson on 3 March 2005 and left Parliament on 30 March, the day that he gave his valedictory in parliament. In his valedictory speech he thanked many people and stated that he thought that his success in this Parliament was fighting for and finally getting the Adult Adoption Information Act passed in 1985. 

As a list MP, his vacant parliamentary seat was filled by the next available candidate on the Labour Party list, Lesley Soper.

Some controversy arose in mid-2005, when not long after he arrived in London, Hunt was told publicly by the New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark that he could not apply for the U.K. pension as it was not appropriate given his position of New Zealand High Commissioner and the fact that he was already collecting a New Zealand parliamentary pension.

On 21 November 2007, the New Zealand Foreign Minister, Winston Peters, announced that the next High Commissioner to London would be Derek Leask from March 2008.

==Personal life==

Hunt never married or had any children. In a 2005 interview he stated not doing so was his biggest regret, thinking that splitting his life between Auckland and Wellington would be an unfair burden to be foisted upon family members. Hunt was the patron of the University of Auckland Debating Society. He was a lifelong enthusiast of the sport of cricket and was an administrator of the sport for many years. He was a fan of classical music.

Hunt died on 8 March 2024, at the age of 85.

==Honours==
In 1977, Hunt was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal and in 1990, the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 2005 New Year Honours, Hunt was appointed a Member of the Order of New Zealand.

==Documentary==
Hunt was also the subject of a documentary, &quot;Father of the House&quot;, directed by Simon Burgin and Xavier Forde, which was filmed in Wellington in 2005.

<doc id="470247" wikidata="Q1703198" url="?curid=470247" title="Jonathan Hunt (Vermont congressman)">
<text>Jonathan Hunt (August 12, 1787May 15, 1832) was an American lawyer and politician from Vermont. He was a member of the United States House of Representatives for the state of Vermont and was a member of the prominent Hunt family of Vermont.

==Early life==
Born in Vernon in the Vermont Republic, Hunt graduated from Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, in 1807. Afterwards, Hunt studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1812. Hunt commenced practice in Brattleboro, Vermont, in 1812. He was the first president of the Old Brattleboro Bank in 1821, the first bank established in Brattleboro, a position he held for years afterward. He also carried the rank of General in the Vermont militia, as had his uncle Arad Hunt.

==Political career==
Hunt held many political positions in Vermont, and served as a member of the Vermont House of Representatives in 1811, 1816, 1817, and 1824. He was elected as an Adams candidate to represent Vermont&#x27;s 1st congressional district in 1827. He served in the United States House of Representatives during the Twentieth, Twenty-first, and Twenty-second Congresses, serving from March 4, 1827, until his death on May 15, 1832.

Hunt was a lifelong friend of statesman and orator Daniel Webster. The brick home that Hunt had built in Brattleboro, later known as the Colonel Hooker home, was the first brick home built in town.

==Death==
Hunt died in Washington, D.C., on May 15, 1832, while still in office. At his death he left an estate valued in excess of $150,000. He was buried in the family plot in the Old Cemetery on the Hill in Brattleboro, Vermont.

==Family life==
A graduate of Dartmouth, Hunt served as a trustee of Vermont&#x27;s Middlebury College, where Hunt family members had been early benefactors.
Hunt was the son of Jonathan Hunt and Lavinia (Swan) Hunt. His father was born in Massachusetts and was an early pioneer and land speculator in Vermont. He served as Lieutenant Governor of Vermont from 1794 to 1796. Hunt&#x27;s uncle was composer and poet Timothy Swan, and his aunt was married to U.S. Congressman Lewis R. Morris.

Hunt married Jane Maria Leavitt of Suffield, Connecticut. She was part of the New England Dwight family which was heavily involved in the shipping business and in the purchase of the Western Reserve. Jane&#x27;s father, Thaddeus Leavitt, was a successful merchant whose clipper ships traded with the West Indies. He invented an early cotton gin and was one of the principal purchasers of the Western Reserve lands in Ohio.

Hunt and his wife Jane had five children: artist Jane Maria Hunt, physician Jonathan Hunt, painter William Morris Hunt, architect Richard Morris Hunt and early photographer and New York attorney Leavitt Hunt. Following Hunt&#x27;s death, his wife took their children to Geneva, Paris and Rome for an extended Grand Tour that stretched into a dozen years. The Hunt children were able to study the arts in European academies and become part of an American expatriate community in Europe. Four of Hunt&#x27;s children returned to America. The fifth, his namesake son Jonathan, remained in Paris, where he studied medicine at the University of Paris and subsequently practiced medicine until his early death, a suicide in 1874. (Jonathan Hunt&#x27;s son William Morris Hunt also committed suicide, at the Isles of Shoals in New Hampshire.) Hunt&#x27;s nephew was Chicago architect Jarvis Hunt.

<doc id="470253" wikidata="Q55532" url="?curid=470253" title="1942 (video game)">
<text>1942 is a 1984 vertically scrolling shooter video game developed and published by Capcom for arcades. Designed by Yoshiki Okamoto, it was the first game in the &quot;194X&quot; series, and was followed by &quot;1943: The Battle of Midway&quot;.

&quot;1942&quot; is set in the Pacific Theater of World War II, and is loosely based on the Battle of Midway. Despite the game being created by Japanese developers, the goal is to reach Tokyo and destroy the Japanese air fleet; this was due to being the first Capcom game designed with Western markets in mind. It went on to be a commercial success in arcades, becoming Japan&#x27;s fifth highest-grossing table arcade game of 1986 and one of top five highest-grossing arcade conversion kits that year in the United States. It was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System, selling over 1 million copies worldwide, along with other home systems.

== Gameplay ==

The player pilots a Lockheed P-38 Lightning dubbed the &quot;Super Ace&quot;. The player has to shoot down enemy planes and avoid enemy fire: a single hit on the plane or a collision with another aircraft causes the loss of one life. During the game, the player may collect a series of power-ups, one of them allowing the plane to be escorted by two other smaller fighters in a Tip Tow formation. Enemies included: Kawasaki Ki-61s, Mitsubishi A6M Zeros and Kawasaki Ki-48s. The boss plane is a Nakajima G10N.

The game has &quot;a special roll button that allows players to avoid dangerous situations by temporarily looping out of&quot; the playfield. In addition to the standard high score, it also has a separate percentage high score, recording the best ratio of enemy fighters to enemies shot down.

== Development ==
The game was designed by Yoshiki Okamoto. The game&#x27;s main goal was to be easily accessible for players. This is why they decided to use a World War II theme. &quot;1942&quot; was also the first Capcom game designed with Western markets in mind. That was why they decided to have the player pilot an American P-38 fighter plane, to appeal to the American market. The game is loosely based on the Battle of Midway, which was a turning point in the Pacific War when the Americans began defeating the Japanese.

==Ports==
The game was released to the MSX, NEC PC-8801, FM-7, and Sharp. A port to the Nintendo Entertainment System developed by Micronics was released in 1985 in Japan and North America in 1986. This version was also released at arcades by Nintendo through their PlayChoice-10 arcade machines.

A Game Boy Color version was also released in North America in May 2000 and the PAL region in the year 2001.

The European games publisher Elite Systems later released versions for the Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, and Commodore 64.

The music of the Commodore 64 version is based on the main verse of Ron Goodwin&#x27;s &quot;633 Squadron&quot; film score, with arrangement by Mark Cooksey.

==Reception==

In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;1942&quot; on their January 1, 1985 issue as being the fourth most-popular arcade game for the previous two weeks. It went on to be Japan&#x27;s seventh highest-grossing table arcade game during the first half of 1986, and the overall fifth highest-grossing table arcade game of 1986. In the United States, it was one of the top five highest-grossing arcade conversion kits of 1986. In the United Kingdom, it was the top-grossing arcade game on the Euromax arcade charts for five months in 1987, from July through November.

The NES version sold over 1 million copies worldwide. &quot;1942&quot; was Capcom&#x27;s breakaway hit, eclipsing in popularity the company&#x27;s preceding three titles: &quot;Vulgus&quot;, &quot;Sonson&quot;, and &quot;Pirate Ship Higemaru&quot;.

Mike Roberts reviewed the arcade game in the May 1985 issue of British magazine &quot;Computer Gamer&quot;. While noting the game&#x27;s scenario was &quot;an odd subject for a Japanese arcade manufacturer&quot; to take up, he said it has &quot;nice&quot; graphics and had an &quot;original&quot; gameplay feature in the form of the percentage high score. Retrospectively, Brett Alan Weiss of &quot;AllGame&quot; called it &quot;a fondly remembered&quot; shooter and praising the special roll button, &quot;perfectly balanced&quot; gameplay, &quot;colorfully detailed&quot; graphics, and &quot;nifty&quot; power-ups.

==Legacy==
&quot;1942&quot; was the first Capcom title to spawn a successful series of sequels, with five titles in the &quot;194X&quot; line released from 1987 to 2000. Many of Capcom&#x27;s other vertical shooters featured very similar gameplay, such as &quot;&quot;.

It was re-released in &quot;Capcom Generations 1&quot; for the PlayStation and Saturn consoles. It was featured in the &quot;Capcom Classics Collection&quot; for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, as well as &quot;Capcom Classics Collection: Reloaded&quot; for the PlayStation Portable. The arcade version was added to the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on December 21, 2010, and in the PAL and North American regions in January 2011. It was also re-released for Windows Mobile Professional.

&quot;1942: Joint Strike&quot; was released for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network in 2008. &quot;1942: First Strike&quot; was released for iOS in 2010.

The game series has sold a total of 1.4 million units worldwide as of December 2019, and stands as Capcom&#x27;s 18th best-selling franchise.

<text>Frederick Joseph Noonan (born April 4, 1893 – disappeared July 2, 1937, declared dead June 20, 1938) was an American flight navigator, sea captain and aviation pioneer, who first charted many commercial airline routes across the Pacific Ocean during the 1930s. As the flight navigator for famed aviator Amelia Earhart in their pioneering attempt at circumnavigating the globe, they disappeared somewhere over the central Pacific Ocean on July 2, 1937.

==Early life==
Fred Noonan was born on April 4, 1893 in Cook County, Illinois, to Joseph T. Noonan (born Lincolnville, Maine, in 1861) and Catherine Egan (born London, England), both of Irish descent. Noonan&#x27;s mother died when he was four, and three years later a census report lists his father as living alone in a Chicago boarding house. Relatives or family friends were likely looking after Noonan. In his own words, Noonan &quot;left school in summer of 1905 and went to Seattle, Washington,&quot; where he was a seaman at an early age, serving in a succession of merchant ships and steadily advancing in his ratings and certifications.

==Maritime career==
At the age of 17, Noonan shipped out of Seattle as an ordinary seaman on a British sailing bark, the &quot;Crompton&quot;. Between 1910 and 1915, Noonan worked on over a dozen ships, rising to the ratings of quartermaster and bosun&#x27;s mate. During World War I, Noonan lived in New York and served aboard several American and British ships in the merchant marine, though he was never in the U.S. Navy. He continued working on merchant ships throughout the war. Serving as an officer on ammunition ships, his harrowing wartime service included being on three vessels that were sunk from under him by U-boats. After the war, Noonan continued in the Merchant Marine and achieved a measure of prominence as a ship&#x27;s officer. In 1926, the U.S. Shipping Board awarded Noonan his license as &quot;master of steamers of any gross tonnage.&quot; His maritime career was characterized by steadily increasing ratings and &quot;good&quot; (typically the highest) work performance reviews. His career moving ahead, 34 year old Noonan married Josephine Sullivan in 1927 in Jackson, Mississippi. After a honeymoon in Cuba, they settled in New Orleans, where Fred worked for the Mississippi Shipping Company as chief mate on SS Carplaka.

==Navigator for Pan Am==
Following a distinguished 22-year career at sea, which included sailing around Cape Horn seven times (three times under sail), Noonan contemplated a new career direction. After learning to fly in the late 1920s, he received a &quot;limited commercial pilot&#x27;s license&quot; in 1930, on which he listed his occupation as &quot;aviator.&quot; In the following year, he was awarded marine license #121190, &quot;Class Master, any ocean,&quot; the qualifications of a merchant ship&#x27;s captain. During the early 1930s, he worked for Pan American World Airways as a navigation instructor in Miami and an airport manager in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, eventually assuming the duties of inspector for all of the company&#x27;s airports. Adapting his maritime navigational expertise to aviation, Fred was instrumental in developing techniques for the company&#x27;s nascent Pacific Division.

In March 1935, Noonan and his wife moved to Oakland, California, and for the rest of that year, Noonan served as navigating officer on the survey flights that pioneered commercial air service across the Pacific. He was the navigator on the first Pan Am Sikorsky S-42 clipper at San Francisco Bay. In April he navigated the historic round-trip China Clipper flight between San Francisco and Honolulu, piloted by Ed Musick (who was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine that year), its course set by Noonan. Noonan was subsequently responsible for mapping Pan Am&#x27;s clipper routes across the Pacific Ocean, participating in many flights to Midway Island, Wake Island, Guam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong. He made at least twenty-one flights for Pan American in 1936, including numerous, often lengthy, test hops and five round-trip Pacific crossings to Manila. His last flight with the airline-a sixteen-day marathon as navigator of the &quot;Philippine Clipper&quot;- concluded on December 7, 1936. In addition to more modern navigational tools, Noonan as a licensed sea captain was known for carrying a ship&#x27;s sextant on these flights. Sometime later that month he left the company. In a 1939 book by Pan Am pilot William Grooch, who reported something of a rebellion among the airline&#x27;s flight crews following the trip, Noonan said, &quot;We&#x27;ve lived on promises for a year. I&#x27;m through.&quot; and resigned immediately.

1937 was a year of transition for Fred Noonan, whose reputation as an expert navigator, along with his role in the development of commercial airline navigation, had already earned him a place in aviation history. The tall, very thin, dark auburn-haired and blue-eyed 43-year-old held maritime ratings and a pilot&#x27;s license and was also a celebrated aerial navigator living in Los Angeles. He resigned from Pan Am because he felt he had risen through the ranks as far as he could as a navigator, and he had an interest in starting a navigation school. On March 3, Noonan&#x27;s attorney filed divorce papers for his wife Josephine in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. Around this time Noonan was also involved in a serious automobile accident. He fell in love with Mary Beatrice Martinelli (née Passadori), herself a divorcee with no children, who ran a beauty salon in Oakland, California. References in his own correspondence make it clear that Noonan enjoyed an occasional drink, and it is possible that he sometimes overindulged but there is no contemporary evidence Noonan was an alcoholic or was fired by Pan American for drinking, although decades later, a few writers and others made some hearsay claims that he was.

==Earhart world flight and disappearance==

Amelia Earhart met Noonan through mutual connections in the Los Angeles aviation community and chose him to serve as her navigator on her World Flight in the Lockheed Electra 10E that she had purchased with funds donated by Purdue University. She planned to circumnavigate the globe at equatorial latitudes. Although this aircraft was of an advanced type for its time, and was dubbed a &quot;flying laboratory&quot; by the press, little real science was planned. The world was already crisscrossed by commercial airline routes (many of which Noonan himself had first navigated and mapped), and the flight is now regarded by some as an adventurous publicity stunt for Earhart&#x27;s gathering public attention for her next book. Noonan had recently left Pan American Airways and was available to help out. Noonan was probably attracted to this project because Earhart&#x27;s mass market fame would almost certainly generate considerable publicity, which in turn might reasonably be expected to attract attention to him and the navigation school that he hoped to establish when they returned. Noonan&#x27;s addition to the Electra&#x27;s crew just days before the departure of the first world flight attempt appears to have been occasioned by the discovery that the flight&#x27;s designated navigator Captain Harry Manning, needed help. Noonan did not have the necessary visa to accompany the flight as far as New Guinea, but his skills in aeronautical-celestial and dead-reckoning navigation were most needed for the flight from Hawaii to Howland Island, a tiny sliver of land in the Pacific Ocean, barely 2,000 meters long. Noonan would leave the flight at Howland and return to Honolulu aboard the U.S. Coast Guard cutter &quot;Shoshone&quot;. This plan appears to have been altered after the plane reached Hawaii.

On March 13, 1937, Noonan&#x27;s name appeared for the first time in the press as a member of Earhart&#x27;s crew. On March 16, the first attempt was delayed due to weather conditions, and Noonan, having had a chance to assess the plane&#x27;s navigational equipment, had identified a major deficiency in the flight&#x27;s preparations. As described in a Time magazine article later that summer, Noonan was &quot;dismayed to discover that there was nothing with which to take celestial bearings except an ordinary ship sextant. He remedied that by borrowing a modern bubble octant designed especially for airplane navigation.&quot; Modern bubble octants were expensive, and Noonan apparently did not own one himself. It is equally apparent that he was unwilling or unable to borrow one from his former employer, even though Pan American had a major terminal in Alameda. The octant was safely aboard when the flight began on March 17 with a record-breaking flight from Burbank, California, to Honolulu. On March 19, Noonan sent a telegram to Mary: &quot;Leaving 1:30 AM your time. Amelia has asked me to continue with her at least as far as Darwin, Australia and possibly around before I can return from Australia. I love you, Fred.&quot; The next day, while the Electra was taking off to begin its second leg to Howland Island, its wing clipped the ground. Earhart cut an engine off to maintain balance, the aircraft ground looped, and its landing gear collapsed. Although there were no injuries, the Lockheed Electra had to be shipped back to Los Angeles by sea for expensive repairs. One week later, on March 27, Fred and Mary were married in Yuma, Arizona. According to newspaper accounts, the couple planned to settle in Oakland but would &quot;spend a brief honeymoon in Hollywood as Noonan is now engaged with Miss Earhart in preparing plans for the re-start of the world flight.&quot; On April 4, Fred&#x27;s forty-fourth birthday, as he and his bride drove through Fresno on their way back to Oakland along the Golden State Highway, they hit another car head-on. Fred escaped with minor bruises, while Mary was hospitalized with &quot;an extensive laceration on the knee and other injuries.&quot; The other driver was not injured, but the man&#x27;s wife and infant daughter were treated for bruises and released. Noonan was cited for driving in the wrong lane. Noonan maintained a post office box address in Hollywood, and a business directory published later that year lists a residence address in Los Angeles. After the Electra was certified on May 19, Noonan was on hand in Burbank the next day for the &quot;sneak takeoff&quot; of the second world flight attempt. Three days later, Earhart and Noonan arrived in Florida, having completed the Electra&#x27;s cross-country test flight. In Miami, Noonan took the opportunity to renew his acquaintance with Helen Day, a young woman he had met when he worked for Pan American&#x27;s Caribbean Division. He wrote to Day at least four times during the world flight.
Over one month later, Earhart and Noonan began the second world flight attempt, this time leaving California in the opposite (eastward) direction. When Earhart made the announcement on May 30, she said she had originally &quot;planed to be alone except for a navigator on the Pacific, where objectives were small islands on a vast ocean. Now I am taking Captain Noonan the whole distance to save time on occasion.&quot; Earhart characterized the pace of their 40-day, eastward trip from Burbank to New Guinea as &quot;leisurely&quot;. As Noonan tracked the Electra&#x27;s progress southward to San Juan, he and Earhart worked along together for the first time on the trip. Earhart made jotted comments that spoke rather dismissively of &quot;Freddie,&quot; as he looked for a lighthouse and pointed out a partly submerged wreck off shore.&quot; Nonetheless, a growing admiration appeared in notations such as &quot;6:35. We sight a reef. Freddie said we&#x27;d pass one at 6:40. Pretty good.&quot; and &quot;Freddie says San Juan at 1:10 EST from white hankies of foam?&quot; (an allusion to Noonan&#x27;s ability to judge surface wind speed and direction from the appearance of the sea). Earhart&#x27;s notes written later in the world flight refer to Noonan as &quot;Fred&quot; or &quot;F.N.,&quot; never &quot;Freddie&quot;. Contrary to belief, Noonan was not confined to the navigator&#x27;s station in the rear cabin and able to communicate with Earhart only in notes passed forward over the fuel tanks by means of a bamboo pole, he spent much of his time in the cockpit with Earhart, clambering over the fuel tanks into the rear cabin only when he needed room to spread out a chart or use the lavatory, though they did communicate primarily in writing, due to the noise of the engines. After completing about 22,000 miles (35,000 km) of the journey, they took off from Lae on July 2, 1937, and headed for Howland Island. Their plan for the 18-hour-long flight was to reach the vicinity of Howland using Noonan&#x27;s celestial navigation abilities and then find Howland by using radio signals transmitted by the U.S. Coast Guard cutter USCGC &quot;Itasca&quot;.

Through a combined sequence of misunderstandings or mishaps (that are still controversial), over scattered clouds, the final approach to Howland Island failed, although Earhart stated by radio that they believed they were in the immediate vicinity of Howland. The strength of the transmissions received indicated that Earhart and Noonan were indeed in the vicinity of Howland island, but could not find it and after numerous more attempts it appeared that the connection had dropped. The last transmission received from Earhart indicated she and Noonan were flying along a line of position (taken from a &quot;sun line&quot; running on 157–337 degrees) which Noonan would have calculated and drawn on a chart as passing through Howland. Two-way radio contact was never established, and the aviators and their aircraft disappeared somewhere over the Central Pacific Ocean. Despite an unprecedented, extensive search by the U.S. Navy—including the use of search aircraft from an aircraft carrier—and the U.S. Coast Guard, no traces of them or their Electra were ever found.

Later research showed that Howland&#x27;s position was misplaced on their chart by approximately five nautical miles. There is also some motion picture evidence to suggest that a belly antenna on their Electra might have snapped on takeoff, which could explain Earhart&#x27;s inability to receive radio transmissions during the flight. One relatively new theory suggests that Noonan may have made a mistake in navigation due to the flight&#x27;s crossing of the International Date Line. However, this theory is based entirely on supposition and misunderstanding of astronomy; it does not offer any evidence Noonan was impacted by or failed to adequately account for the 24-hour variance in his sun line calculations, and was reportedly debunked by an experienced navigator on a TIGHAR forum.

===Theories on disappearance===

The U.S. Navy concluded that the Electra had run out of fuel and Earhart and Noonan ditched at sea and perished. Many later studies came to the same conclusion; navigator and aeronautical engineer Elgen Long, developed the &quot;crash and sink&quot; theory which is the most widely accepted explanation of Earhart&#x27;s and Noonan&#x27;s fate. Joe Lodrige, an experienced pilot and navigator, did extensive research, and his analysis put the aircraft east of Howland. His theory is based on an error in Noonan&#x27;s position when he took his sun line of position. The angle of the sun was almost on the horizon, as it was just coming up. Lodrige is able to position the aircraft more accurately based on wind data. With this better position, his sun line puts the crew too far east. Thus, when they flew the distance required, and then turned 90 degrees southeast on course, they never found the island. Lodrige puts their final crash position as 0°10&#x27;N 175°55&#x27;W, which is in the water at 65 miles
southeast of Howland and 39 miles east of Baker.

The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) notes that in her last message received at Howland Island, Earhart reported that they were flying a standard position line (or sun line), a routine procedure for an experienced navigator like Noonan. This line passed within sight of Gardner Island (now called Nikumaroro) in the Phoenix Island Group to the southeast, and TIGHAR has found a range of documented, archaeological, and anecdotal evidence supporting a hypothesis that Earhart and Noonan found Gardner Island, uninhabited at the time, landed the Electra on a flat reef near the wreck of a freighter, and sent sporadic radio messages from there. Ric Gillespie, author of &quot;Finding Amelia&quot;, wrote that while listening to alleged radio signals on their home radios, Mabel Larremore heard a woman claiming to be Earhart say Noonan was &quot;seriously injured&quot; and that she had &quot;some injuries but not as serious as Mr. Noonan&#x27;s.&quot; Betty Klenck heard an apparently injured man acting agitated with a distressed woman claiming to be Earhart, and uttering repeatedly what sounded like, &quot;Marie&quot;. Noonan&#x27;s wife&#x27;s first name was Mary Bea. The man said &quot;Water&#x27;s knee deep-let me out.&quot; Klenck heard the woman say, &quot;George, get the suitcase in my closet...California.&quot; Four years earlier, in a letter to her mother, Earhart had asked that, should anything ever happen to her, the suitcase of private papers stored in her closet in California be destroyed. Klenck heard the woman repeatedly say something that sounded like &quot;New York City&quot;, which has been speculated to have been actually &quot;Norwich City&quot;, a large British freighter wrecked on the island in 1929. The signals had stopped when search planes flew over the island a week after the disappearance, noting &quot;signs of recent habitation.&quot; TIGHAR theorises that the Electra had by then been washed over the reef edge into the ocean where it broke up and sank. TIGHAR theorises that Earhart, and possibly Noonan, may have tried to survive on the island before perishing as castaways, just before a British exploratory expedition visited Gardner Island in October 1937, just three months after the disappearance. In 1940, Gerald Gallagher, a British colonial officer and a licensed pilot, radioed his superiors to tell them that he believed he had found Earhart&#x27;s skeleton, along with a sextant box, under a tree on the island&#x27;s southeast corner. Although Noonan required and used a sextant for celestial navigation, this artifact has been connected to an American naval survey vessel that visited Gardner Island in 1939, a year before it was recovered. In a 1998 report to the American Anthropological Association, researchers, including a forensic anthropologist and an archaeologist, concluded, &quot;What we can be certain of is that bones were found on the island in 1939–40, associated with what were observed to be women&#x27;s shoes and a navigator&#x27;s sextant box, and that the morphology of the recovered bones, insofar as we can tell by applying contemporary forensic methods to measurements taken at the time, appears consistent with a female of Earhart&#x27;s height and ethnic origin. However, the bones themselves have been lost since they were examined by Dr. D.W. Hoodless on Fiji in 1940. A subsequent study published in 2018 also made similar claims as those presented in 1998. Neither study had the benefit of actually examining the long lost bones as Hoodless did. Typically, forensic anthropologists, like all scientists, base their conclusions on their own examinations. Hoodless&#x27; examination methods and original conclusions that the bones belonged to man have been upheld by reputable modern researchers.

Contradictory research has recently been advanced; it is possible to set course for and see Gardner from a point on the over Howland sunline (passing seven miles east of), but one does not simply reach Gardner by following such a line. A position line is part of a circle circumference and may be considered a straight line only for limited distances. The sun&#x27;s azimuth change per hour is about 15 arcdegrees, whereas the Howland-to-Gardner flight (409 statute miles) would have taken 2 hours 55 minutes (at 140 mph). As a result, the aircraft, when having followed the LOP by astronavigation, would have passed far northward of Gardner when reaching its meridian. The &quot;Gardner&quot; hypothesis originates from a 1980s book where navigator Paul Rafford, Jr. &quot;fell off his chair when seeing that the position line points in the direction of Gardner Island&quot;. Apart from such supposition, it was with the available fuel reserves (45 gallons) impossible to reach Gardner from the Howland region: the route would have taken 120 U.S. gallons at least.

The author of an article in &quot;Journal of Navigation&quot;, Vol. 9, No. 3, December 2011, avers that due to insufficient fuel reserves from 1912 GMT, no land other than Howland itself and Baker at 45 miles could be reached. With a maximum ferry range of 2,740 statute miles, even the closest islands Winslow Reef and McKean Island, at 210 and 350 miles away respectively, were unreachable.

David W. Jourdan refutes the theory that Earhart and Noonan landed on Gardner Island, claiming that any transmissions attributed to Gardner Island were false.

Ocean explorer Robert Ballard led a 2019 expedition to locate Earhart&#x27;s Electra or evidence that it landed on Nikumaroro as supposed by the Gardner/Nikumaroro hypothesis. After days of searching the deep cliffs supporting the island and the nearby ocean using state of the art equipment and technology, Ballard did not find any evidence of the plane or any associated wreckage of it. Allison Fundis, Ballard&#x27;s chief operating officer of the expedition stated, “We felt like if her plane was there, we would have found it pretty early in the expedition.”

==In popular culture==
Although Fred Noonan has left a much smaller mark in popular culture than Amelia Earhart&#x27;s, his legacy is remembered sporadically. Noonan is often mentioned in W.P. Kinsella&#x27;s novels. Noonan was portrayed by actor David Graf in &quot;The 37s&quot;, an episode of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. The character of an aircraft pilot named Fred Noonan is portrayed by actor Eddie Firestone in &quot;The Long Train&quot;, a 1961 episode of the television series &quot;The Untouchables&quot;. Both a baseball stadium and an aircraft rental agency are named after Fred Noonan. A 1990 episode of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; featured Mark Stitham as Noonan. In a 1976 TV miniseries Noonan was played by Bill Vint. Rutger Hauer portrayed Noonan in the TV movie &quot;Amelia Earhart: The Final Flight&quot; (1994), and Christopher Eccleston portrayed Noonan in the biographical movie &quot;Amelia&quot; (2009).

Fred Noonan is mentioned in the song &quot;Amelia&quot; on Bell X1&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Blue Lights on the Runway&quot;, which contemplates the last moments and the fates of Amelia Earhart and Noonan. The first ballad written about Amelia and Fred was written and sung by &quot;Red River&quot; Dave McEnerney in 1938 called &quot;Amelia Earhart&#x27;s Last Flight&quot;. Antje Duvekot&#x27;s Song &quot;Ballad of Fred Noonan&quot; on her 2012 album &quot;New Siberia&quot; imagines Noonan&#x27;s unrequited and unremembered love for Earhart. The controversy over Earhart and Noonan&#x27;s disappearance was discussed in the song &quot;The True Story of Amelia Earhart&quot; on Plainsong&#x27;s album &quot;In Search of Amelia Earhart.&quot; Noonan and Earhart&#x27;s fate is also considered in the song &quot;Amelia&quot; by Mark Kelly&#x27;s Marathon, the opening single from the 2020 eponymous album by Mark Kelly (keyboardist) from Marillion. Noonan is a main character in Jane Mendelsohn&#x27;s novel, &quot;I Was Amelia Earhart&quot; (1996), and in Neal Bowers&#x27; poem &quot;The Noonan Variations&quot; (&quot;The Sewanee Review&quot;, Volume CXVIII, 1990).

<text>Night Trap is a 1992 interactive movie developed by Digital Pictures and published by Sega for the Sega CD. Presented primarily through full-motion video (FMV), &quot;Night Trap&quot; has the player observe teenage girls having a sleepover visiting a house which, unbeknownst to them, is infested with vampires. The player watches live surveillance footage and triggers traps to capture anyone endangering the girls. The player can switch between different cameras to keep watch over the girls and eavesdrop on conversations to follow the story and listen for clues.

The &quot;Night Trap&quot; concept originated in a 1986 prototype game developed by Axlon to demonstrate their Control-Vision game console to Hasbro. The system used VHS tape technology to present film-like gaming experiences. With the system picked up by Hasbro, the production of &quot;Night Trap&quot; commenced. The video footage was recorded in 1987, followed by six months of editing and game programming. Hasbro suddenly canceled the Control-Vision in 1989, which prompted the game&#x27;s executive producer, Tom Zito, to purchase the film footage and found Digital Pictures to complete &quot;Night Trap&quot;. &quot;Night Trap&quot; was eventually released in October 1992 as the first interactive movie on the Sega CD, becoming a North American launch title for the add-on.

&quot;Night Trap&quot; received mixed reviews; critics praised the B movie-esque quality, humor, and video animation, but criticized the gameplay as shallow. The game was one of the principal subjects of a 1993 United States Senate committee hearing on violent video games, along with &quot;Lethal Enforcers&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. &quot;Night Trap&quot; was cited during the hearing as promoting gratuitous violence and sexual aggression against women, prompting toy retailers Toys &quot;R&quot; Us and Kay-Bee Toys to pull the game from shelves that December, and Sega to cease producing copies in January 1994. The Senate hearing led to the creation of the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), the North American video game ratings board still used today. The controversy surrounding &quot;Night Trap&quot; inspired its designer, Rob Fulop, to then create a contrastingly &quot;cute&quot; game, which was released as &quot;&quot; in 1995.

After the controversy subsided, &quot;Night Trap&quot; was ported to other systems, including the 32X, 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, MS-DOS, and Mac OS. It was re-released in 2017 and 2018 for eighth-generation consoles to mark its 25th anniversary. Retrospective reviews of &quot;Night Trap&quot; were negative, owing to FMV&#x27;s aging appeal as a game medium, and it has been cited as one of the worst video games of all time.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Night Trap&quot; is an interactive movie video game that uses full motion video (FMV) to present the story and gameplay. The player is instructed by the in-game police squad to watch live surveillance footage of the Martin household and trigger traps to capture anyone that is seen endangering the house guests. Cameras are situated in eight locations in and around the house: the entryway, living room, kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, driveway, and two hallways. A map is available as well so the player can see how the rooms are connected. The player can freely switch between viewing the different cameras to keep up with house activities and pick up clues from conversations. Kelli, an undercover agent, will also provide clues to the player. The player must avoid trapping her, any other agent, or the house guests.

When someone is within range of a trap, a sensor bar will move into a red zone. Activating the trap at this moment will capture them. If the trap is activated when the bar is not in the red zone, the trap will not work and will become disabled for a short period of time. The traps will also only work if the access code is correct. There are six possible access codes, and the player can eavesdrop on conversations to find out when the Martins change the code. When a new code is learned, the player must wait until the speaker leaves the room before changing the access code to the correct color to maintain control of the traps. Counters on the screen indicate how many perpetrators have entered the house and how many have been captured.

==Plot==
The opening exposition to &quot;Night Trap&quot; is presented to the player by Cmdr. Simms of the Sega Control Attack Team (S.C.A.T.) on Sega CD, or Special Control Attack Team in other versions. He explains that the team was alerted to the disappearance of five teenage girls who were last seen at the Martin winery estate. The Martin family consists of Victor Martin, his wife Sheila, their children Jeff and Sarah, and cousin Tony. The missing girls were reportedly invited to stay for the night. Police questioned the Martin family, but they claimed the girls had left safely, and they refused to let the police search the property. The police then handed over the case to S.C.A.T., which investigated the house and discovered a series of traps, security cameras, and an operational unit in the basement to control the apparatus. The S.C.A.T. agents spliced an override cable onto the control system and connected it to a control panel in the back hallway of the house. The player is given the role of an internal S.C.A.T. operative charged with controlling the traps and cameras from this back hallway.

Five more teenage girls head towards the estate, Kelli, Ashley, Lisa, Cindy, and Megan. S.C.A.T. has placed agent Kelli Medd within the group as an undercover agent. The girls are not aware of her true identity. Also with the girls is Danny, Lisa&#x27;s younger brother. The house is invaded by Augers, vampiric beings that need blood to survive. The Martin family themselves are full vampires. The following events and the ending vary widely depending on which characters the player saves from the Augers.

==Development==
===Concept===
Rob Fulop, developer of &quot;Demon Attack&quot; (1982) and other Atari games, began working with Atari founder Nolan Bushnell at his company Axlon shortly after the video game crash of 1983. James Riley was also working with Bushnell at the time on a series of interactive retail advertising campaigns. Riley received a call from Fulop, his neighbor, who explained that an engineer presented an interesting device to another one of Bushnell&#x27;s employees, Tom Zito. The system used VHS technology to create movie-like gaming experiences and allowed four video tracks to be played simultaneously. The team dubbed this system &quot;NEMO&quot; (Never Ever Mention Outside).
Zito wanted to put together some demos to present the technology to Hasbro. Riley wanted to create an environment the player could move freely about, leading to the idea of surveillance cameras. Fulop and Riley were inspired by the play &quot;Tamara&quot; (1981) which ran parallel stories running in 13 different rooms. The audience would need to decide for themselves which stories they wanted to follow. Fulop and Riley watched the play three times over the course of a weekend in 1985. Fulop and Riley liked the design model and thought it would make a good basis for an interactive media experience. A prototype game titled &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot; was produced to demonstrate the new technology to Hasbro and test the surveillance camera gameplay. It was a short five-minute demo where the player follows suspicious characters around a house to find who stole a stash of money. The player switches between cameras to observe the characters and eavesdrop on their conversations; all the characters have a plot to steal the money. At the end of the game, the player must guess who stole the money. In December 1986, the team flew to Hasbro headquarters in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and pitched the technology to Hasbro CEO Stephen Hassenfeld and a boardroom of 22 executives who liked the system and gave funding to support further development for the technology and games.

Ready to begin work on a full game, the NEMO team returned to the idea of surveillance cameras but wanted to make a more interactive and engaging experience. Zito originally had a plan for an interactive movie based on the &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; film series. After negotiations with the film studio fell through, Zito hired Terry McDonell to write an original script. Zito has since identified Riley, Fulop, and McDonell as the three main creative minds behind &quot;Night Trap&quot;. A cross-functional team of writers, directors, game designers, and programmers discussed how to blend the art of film with the interactivity of video games to create a compelling interactive narrative. The initial idea was to take the basis of &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot; to an extreme with a billionaire leaving an extremely large sum of money alone in a large house, guarded by a state-of-the-art security system. In this concept, the billionaire&#x27;s daughter is staying at the house with her teenage friends when the house is attacked by ninja burglars who are attempting to steal the money. Through much deliberation, the game evolved into the final vampire concept seen in &quot;Night Trap&quot;. Hasbro was concerned that the game may feature &quot;reproducible violence&quot;. As a result, Hasbro did not want the vampires, later dubbed Augers, to bite or move too quickly. In addition, the device used by the Augers to drain blood from their victims was purposely designed to pass Hasbro&#x27;s non-reproducible violence requirements.

===Production and release===

&quot;Night Trap&quot; was developed over six months and was part movie shoot and part programming. The film was shot on 35 mm film in Culver City, CA across 16 days in 1987, with editing taking another few months. The film was directed by James Riley. The director of photography was Don Burgess, who later went on to shoot the award-winning &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (1994). Originally the set was going to be darker, but it was made brighter for fear the footage would pixelate in-game. The script was unusual because it was built around the multi-linear gameplay. Riley was focused on timing the shoots correctly to sync the movement of actors among the rooms. There were four scenes occurring simultaneously at any given time, although there were eight rooms (the other four being still images). Dana Plato was the most famous actor involved, known for her work on the American sitcom &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; (1978–86). Plato&#x27;s career was spiraling downward at the time, partially due to her personal problems with drugs and alcohol. Fulop recounted that at first, she was very professional, but later she began showing up late and did not want to rehearse. The Augers were played by stuntmen. They developed a hobbling walk so that they would always be prepared to fall when the traps dropped under their feet. The software was developed concurrently with the filming and editing. Through developing &quot;Night Trap&quot;, Fulop and his team came to realize their old-fashioned development methods did not always work with interactive movies. The team could not go back and &quot;tweak&quot; on-screen elements and other assets, such as inserting new scenes or changing the time an actor comes into view. They had to work with the video footage they were handed over.

&quot;Night Trap&quot; was ready for the launch of the NEMO in 1989 alongside another interactive movie, &quot;Sewer Shark&quot;. Both games had a combined budget of about US$4.5 million ($1.5 million for &quot;Night Trap&quot;, and $3 million for &quot;Sewer Shark&quot;) making them two of the most expensive video games of the era. However, just before the launch of the NEMO in early 1989, which was now called the Control-Vision, Hasbro canceled the system release. The company cited high hardware costs as the reason. The system was originally intended to sell for $199, but the high manufacturing costs of the system&#x27;s DRAM drove it to . In contrast, the market-leading Nintendo Entertainment System sold for around $100 in 1989. Riley also cited the high cost of filmmaking for deterring Hasbro. Fulop went on to form PF.Magic, which later created the &quot;Petz&quot; virtual pet simulation series, partly inspired by the negativity surrounding &quot;Night Trap&quot;.

Zito purchased the rights to the abandoned Control-Vision games, and after learning that Sony was considering &quot;Sewer Shark&quot; for a release on its forthcoming Super NES CD-ROM, he founded his own company to bring them to the system, Digital Pictures. When the Super NES CD-ROM failed to materialize, Zito began working with Sega for a release on the Sega CD. &quot;Night Trap&quot; transitioned from VHS to CD-ROM and was released in 1992 for the Sega CD, five years after it was originally filmed. In May 1993, British censors banned the game from being sold to children under 15 years old in the United Kingdom, which led to Sega creating the Videogame Rating Council (VRC) age rating system. Sega also released the Sega CD version in Japan on November 19, 1993.

==United States congressional hearings==


On December 9, 1993, a United States Senate committee held a hearing on the subject of video game violence. The hearing was led by senators Joe Lieberman and Herb Kohl and was covered in major newspapers including &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. At the hearing, the committee scrutinized &quot;Night Trap&quot; along with Midway&#x27;s &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1992). Lieberman claimed &quot;Night Trap&quot; featured gratuitous violence and promoted sexual aggression against women. One game over scene considered particularly offensive involved the nightgown-clad character Lisa being captured by Augers attempting to drain her blood. Tom Zito attempted to explain the context of the nightgown scene in defense of the game, but he claims he was silenced.

In the short documentary &quot;Dangerous Games&quot; (included with PC versions), the producers and cast explained the plot was to prevent the trapping and killing of women. In addition, the blood draining device was intended to look unrealistic to mitigate the violence. There are scenes in which the girls are grabbed or pulled by enemies, but no nudity or extreme acts of violence. Fulop was irked that &quot;Night Trap&quot; was compared to &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, which features ultraviolent gore, such as a character ripping the heart out of an opponent. During the hearings, Nintendo of America senior vice president Howard Lincoln testified that &quot;Night Trap&quot; would never appear on a Nintendo system because it did not pass its guidelines. Fulop believed Lincoln was referring to technical guidelines—&quot;Night Trap&quot; could not run on a Nintendo system due to the lack of a CD-ROM drive—but Lincoln made it sound as if the game was unworthy of Nintendo&#x27;s moral standards. Critics noted this as a deliberate move from Nintendo to distance itself from the scandal and make Sega look unfavorable.

As a result of the publicity generated by the hearings, retailers sold 50,000 copies of &quot;Night Trap&quot; the following week. Two weeks before Christmas, the game was removed from store shelves in the United States&#x27; two largest toy store chains, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us and Kay-Bee Toys, after receiving numerous complaints that were suspected to be part of an organized telephone campaign. Both stores continued to stock &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. The &quot;Night Trap&quot; box art was also criticized by interest groups for what many believed to be a sexist depiction. In January 1994, Sega withdrew &quot;Night Trap&quot; from the market. Bill White, Sega Vice President of Marketing, stated that &quot;Night Trap&quot; was pulled because the continuing controversy surrounding it prevented constructive dialogue about an industry-wide rating system. He also stated that the game was misunderstood and was developed as a parody of vampire melodramas. Sega also announced in January the upcoming release of a censored version. The hearings led to the creation of the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) in 1994, the video game ratings board in North America still used today. After the controversy subsided, the game was ported to the 3DO, Sega 32X, MS-DOS, and Mac OS, each with a different cover from the original. Virgin Games released the 3DO version in Japan on June 25, 1994.

==Reception==

Initial reviews for &quot;Night Trap&quot; on the Sega CD were mixed. It was the first interactive movie on the system and was thus seen as breaking new ground in both genre and technology. Critics were quick to point out the game&#x27;s qualities that were reminiscent of teen horror movies. The staff at &quot;Sega Force&quot; said that playing the game was like &quot;directing your own B movie. &quot;Night Trap&quot; makes you feel part of the game.&quot; Critics identified the &quot;warped&quot; and &quot;tacky&quot; sense of humor as helping the game&#x27;s appeal and adding to its charm. From a technological perspective, the video was praised for being high-quality and smooth, although the Sega CD&#x27;s low color capabilities were identified as a weakness. The most common point of complaint was the gameplay. Some critics cited it for being boring and shallow because it mostly involved pressing one button at the right time to trap the enemies. The staff at &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; said &quot;Night Trap&quot; was reminiscent of &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; (1983) and &quot;Space Ace&quot; (1984) and shared the same issues those games had with gameplay just being a matter of hitting buttons in the right moments. Reviewing the game in &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine, Glenn Rubenstein said that &quot;Night Trap&quot; &quot;could be called the best game ever. Well maybe not the best, but it certainly is the most entertaining, that&#x27;s for sure.&quot; He particularly praised the use of live actors and the need to play through the game multiple times in order to see everything.

Ports of &quot;Night Trap&quot; to other platforms received more harsh reviews; critics said the game did not age well. Staff at &quot;GamePro&quot; said it was &quot;innovative at one time, but &quot;Trap&quot;″s graphics and sounds now play like standard stuff.&quot; Reviewers at &quot;GameFan&quot; blamed the game&#x27;s extensive publicity for making it seem better than it truly was, saying &quot;it&#x27;s a so-so game that got a lot more attention than it deserved.&quot; Critics overwhelmingly found the game to be boring and dull. &quot;Next Generation&quot; called it &quot;one of the most crashing bores ever released...this is a nongame.&quot; Critics agreed that the 3DO and 32X provided a larger color palette and higher-quality video than the Sega CD original. &quot;Night Trap&quot; was a commercial success, with sales totaling 400,000 copies by 1998.

In retrospect, &quot;Night Trap&quot; is viewed negatively and is mostly remembered for the controversy it stirred. It was ranked the 12th worst video game of all-time by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; editor Seanbaby in 2001. He and other game journalists also featured the game in a 2007 episode of &quot;Broken Pixels,&quot; a comedy web series that covers bad and obscure games. &quot;Yahoo! Games&quot; listed it among the most controversial games of all-time in 2007, saying: &quot;If it weren&#x27;t for controversy...this throwaway Sega CD game would have drifted into obscurity as merely another failed attempt at marrying gameplay with live-action video.&quot; &quot;Game Informer&quot; listed the game among the worst horror games of all time in 2008. It was ranked number 59 on GamesRadar&#x27;s 100 worst games of all time in 2014, in which they believed it was &quot;less of a game and more a test of patience&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; listed &quot;Night Trap&quot; at number six of 50 worst games of all time, saying that it was &quot;the ultimate experience of FMV gone bad&quot;.

==Re-release==
In May 2014, &quot;Night Trap&quot; designer James Riley announced that he was in talks to re-release the game with improved resolution and gameplay. That August, a Kickstarter campaign appeared for the game&#x27;s original creators, who formed a company titled Night Trap LLC. The developers said that if the campaign was successful, they would be looking into re-releasing other Digital Pictures titles. Furthermore, the company was also considering making a sequel to the original game. The Kickstarter failed, only gaining $39,843 of its $330,000 goal.

Two years later, in May 2016, game developer Tyler Hogle created a tech demo of &quot;Night Trap&quot; being played on a smartphone. Hogle had previously worked on official ports for two other Digital Pictures games, &quot;Double Switch&quot; (1993) and &quot;Quarterback Attack&quot; (1995). He posted a short video of his &quot;Night Trap&quot; demo online anonymously, and some gaming websites published stories on the video and contacted Tom Zito to ask if he was involved. Hogle got into contact with Zito, and the two began working towards a full release. The original source code and 1987 master footage were lost. Riley, however, possessed a copy of the timed master footage and provided it to Hogle. Because the footage was already timed, it was easier for Hogle to develop; however, he had to replay the original game multiple times to learn what actions triggered which scenes.

&quot;Night Trap: 25th Anniversary Edition&quot; was announced in April 2017 to commemorate the game&#x27;s 25th anniversary. The game was released on PlayStation 4 and Windows on August 15, 2017, with an Xbox One release planned for the future. The game was developed and published by Hogle&#x27;s Screaming Villains, and a limited-edition physical release by Limited Run Games was made available for the PlayStation 4 with three different cover art variations available that mimic the packaging of the original Sega CD release, the later Sega CD release, and the 32X version. The ESRB gave the re-release a &quot;Teen&quot; rating, a grade lower than the original&#x27;s &quot;Mature&quot; rating. The anniversary edition of &quot;Night Trap&quot; uses the full uncompressed video footage with various new additions: deleted scenes including an introduction and a death scene featuring Danny, a behind-the-scenes developer commentary, a &quot;theater mode&quot; to watch all the story-related videos, a &quot;survivor mode&quot; which places Augers randomly in the house, and a playable version of &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot;.

The anniversary edition was released on the Nintendo Switch on August 24, 2018. A version for the PlayStation Vita was also released. In 2023, to commemorate April Fool&#x27;s Day, Limited Run Games announced a Game Boy Advance port of &quot;Night Trap&quot;. The version was only available for preorder that weekend, and shipped in 2024. Unlike other versions, the Game Boy Advance game features no gameplay and only plays the video scenes.

<doc id="470261" wikidata="Q7033770" url="?curid=470261" title="Night-blooming cereus">
<text>Night-blooming cereus is the common name referring to many flowering ceroid cacti that bloom at night. The flowers are short lived, and some of these species, such as &quot;Selenicereus grandiflorus&quot;, bloom only once a year, for a single night, though most put out multiple flowers over several weeks, each of which opens for only a single night. Other names for one or more cacti with this habit are princess of the night, Honolulu queen (for &quot;Hylocereus undatus&quot;), Christ in the manger, dama de noche, and queen of the night (which is also used for an unrelated plant species).

==Genera and species==

While many cacti referred to as night-blooming cereus belong to the tribe Cereeae, other night-blooming cacti in the subfamily Cactoideae may also be called night-blooming cereus. Cacti which may be called by this name include:
* &quot;Cereus&quot;
* &quot;Echinopsis&quot; (usually &quot;Echinopsis pachanoi&quot;, San Pedro cactus)
* &quot;Epiphyllum&quot; (usually &quot;Epiphyllum oxypetalum&quot;, gooseneck cactus; grown as an indoor houseplant throughout the world, and the most popular cultivated night-blooming cereus)
* &quot;Harrisia&quot;
* &quot;Hylocereus&quot; (of which &quot;Hylocereus undatus&quot; is the most frequently cultivated outdoors and is the main source of the commercial fruit crop, dragonfruit)
* &quot;Monvillea&quot;
* &quot;Nyctocereus&quot; (usually &quot;Nyctocereus serpentinus&quot;)
* &quot;Peniocereus&quot; (&quot;Peniocereus greggii&quot;, the best known, is strictly a desert plant which grows from an underground tuber and is infrequently cultivated)
* &quot;Selenicereus&quot; (usually &quot;Selenicereus grandiflorus&quot;)
* &quot;Trichocereus&quot;

==Description==

Regardless of genus or species, night-blooming cereus flowers are almost always white or very pale shades of other colors, often large and frequently fragrant. Most of the flowers open after nightfall, and by dawn, most are wilting. Plants in the same geographical area tend to bloom on the same night. Also, for healthy plants, there can sometimes be as many as three separate blooming events spread out over the warmest months. The plants that bear such flowers can be tall, columnar, and sometimes extremely large and tree-like, but more frequently are thin-stemmed climbers. While some night-blooming cereus are grown indoors in homes or greenhouses in colder climates, most plants are too large or ungainly for this treatment and are only found outdoors in tropical areas.

==Cultivation and uses==

The dried flowers of the night-blooming cereus (霸王花) are a common ingredient used in Cantonese slow-simmered soup (traditional Chinese: 老火湯; pinyin: &quot;lǎohuǒ tāng&quot;; Jyutping: &quot;lou5 fo2 tong1&quot;). Some night-blooming cereus plants produce fruits which are large enough for people to consume. These include some of the members of the genus &quot;Cereus&quot;, but most commonly the fruit of the &quot;Hylocereus&quot;. &quot;Hylocereus&quot; fruit has the advantage of lacking exterior spines, in contrast to the fruit of cacti such as the &quot;Selenicereus&quot; fruit, being brightly colored and having a pleasant taste. Since the late 1990s, &quot;Hylocereus&quot; fruit has been commercially grown and sold in tropical locations like Australia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, and Hawaii.

<text>Hugh Guthrie (13 August 1866 – 3 November 1939) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as a minister in the governments of Sir Robert Borden, Arthur Meighen and R. B. Bennett.

== Biography ==
He was born in Guelph, Canada West, the son of Donald Guthrie, and studied there and at Osgoode Hall, becoming a barrister. Guthrie was named a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1902. He married Maude Henrietta, the daughter of Guelph businessman Thomas H. Scarff.

Guthrie was first elected to the House of Commons as a Liberal in 1900 from the riding of Wellington South. He sat in Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s caucus for 17 years, but crossed the floor to join the Unionist government of Robert Borden as a result of the Conscription Crisis of 1917. The former Liberal backbencher became a leading light in his new party, serving as solicitor general under Borden. With the end of World War I, most Liberal-Unionists either rejoined the Liberal Party or joined the new Progressive Party. Guthrie, however, stayed with the Conservatives, becoming minister of militia and defence and running for re-election as a Conservative in the 1921 election. After the election, he joined the Conservatives on the Opposition benches.

As a result of the 1926 &quot;King-Byng Affair&quot;, Meighen&#x27;s Conservatives formed a government in which Guthrie served as Minister of Justice and Minister of National Defence (acting until July 13). This second stint in Cabinet ended with the defeat of the Meighen government in that fall&#x27;s election. Meighen lost his seat, and Guthrie served as Leader of the Opposition and interim leader of the Conservative Party for a full year.

Guthie sought the party leadership at the leadership convention that the party held in 1927, but was defeated by R.B. Bennett. John Diefenbaker was a delegate to that convention and he wrote in his memoirs that Guthrie&#x27;s candidacy was hurt when the former Liberal absent-mindedly declared in his speech to delegates that the Conservative meeting was the &quot;greatest Liberal convention in history&quot;.

Bennett led the Conservatives to victory in the 1930 election, and Guthrie was appointed Minister of Justice and Attorney General. In 1931, he led the Canadian delegation to the League of Nations. In 1933, he introduced legislation making it illegal to carry a concealed weapon without authorization. In 1935, he clashed with opposition Member of Parliament Agnes Macphail who demanded an inquiry into inhumane conditions in Canada&#x27;s prisons such as the whipping of prisoners.

As the Great Depression worsened and millions were unemployed, the government became increasingly concerned about political instability and the growth of radical movements. Guthrie&#x27;s department was responsible for the persecution of the Communist Party of Canada, and the arrest and incarceration of Communists, including leader Tim Buck, for sedition.

In 1933, Tim Buck was shot at by soldiers in an apparent assassination attempt while he was in his cell during a prison riot. Guthrie was forced to admit that the attack was deliberate, but claimed the intent was only to frighten him; however, the public outcry at this incident lead to Buck being released.

In 1935, unemployed workers in British Columbia deserted the remote relief camps established by the Bennett government, and began the &quot;On to Ottawa Trek&quot;. Thousands of unemployed workers hopped on freight trains heading east intending to converge in Ottawa and press their demands on the government. Bennett&#x27;s cabinet saw this as an insurrectionary movement and panicked. In the House of Commons, Guthrie charged that the protesters &quot;were a distinct menace to the peace, order and good government of Canada.&quot;

As the protesters entered Saskatchewan, Guthrie had the Trek banned, over the objections of Saskatchewan Premier James G. Gardiner. He and Bennett ordered the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to use tear gas and revolvers to break up the Trek when it entered Regina. The city was but under siege with hundreds of police officers moved in blocking all exits from the city. On July 1, 1935, the police attacked a meeting attended by 3,000 people resulting in one death, dozens of injuries and national outrage.

Guthrie, now 69, did not run in the 1935 election that routed Bennett&#x27;s government, preferring to retire from politics. He died four years later.

<text>SlamBall is a hybrid sport combining elements from basketball, American football, hockey, and gymnastics played with four trampolines in front of each net and boards around the court edge. While SlamBall is based on basketball, it is a contact sport, with blocks, collisions and rough physical play as part of the game, similar to elements of American football and ice hockey.

Professional SlamBall games currently air on television for ESPN and stream on ESPN+. Previously, they aired on television with Spike TV for two seasons in 2002–2003, and the POWERade SlamBall Challenge was aired on CSTV (now CBS Sports Network) in 2007. SlamBall returned in August 2008, airing on Versus (now NBC Sports Network) and CBS. The 2008 SlamBall season aired at one point on weekends on Cartoon Network. SlamBall was shown on One HD in Australia during 2009. SlamBall held its first major international tournament in China in 2012.

==History==
SlamBall was invented in 1999 by Mason Gordon, who was working at the time for Tollin/Robbins Productions. The name SlamBall is owned by Gordon&#x27;s company. Inspired by video games, Gordon sketched an idea on a napkin for a sport that combined several existing ones. He approached his boss, movie and television producer Mike Tollin, who liked the idea and thought Gordon was &quot;onto something.&quot; Tollin helped finance the construction of a prototype court in an East Los Angeles warehouse six months later.

Gordon then tried to convince street basketball players to test his new idea; he wanted to find skilled, strong players who could compete comfortably while launching off trampolines and crashing into each other in mid-air.

Five recruits—James Willis, Sean Jackson, David Redmond, Michael Goldman, and Jeff Sheridan—trained with Gordon to produce the first games. These original six players were part of the first two teams, the Los Angeles Rumble and the Chicago Mob. These two teams played an exhibition series in 2001, which the Chicago Mob won. Soon, more players were brought in, including Stan Fletcher, Rob Wilson and Dion Mays.
First played in Los Angeles, the game gained attention from street basketball players in the area. Within a year, 400 people had been enlisted as potential players. Open tryouts were held and the selection of players based on athletic ability, body control and court awareness started. Reducing numbers to about 60 players, the first ever SlamBall combine was held where players and coaches learned safety, the game and basic strategy.
In 2002, SlamBall made its television debut, on The National Network (later Spike TV and now the Paramount Network), soon after former Philadelphia 76ers owner Pat Croce had signed on as a partner. Six teams (the Bouncers, Diablos, Mob, Rumble, Slashers, and Steal) played in the inaugural season. Former NBA All-Star Reggie Theus served as studio co-host and color commentator.

After the second season in 2003, SlamBall creator Mason Gordon and co-producer Telepictures Productions had a disagreement. The league was dissolved. Five years later the league resurfaced for one more season. The league opened its doors to open try-outs.
The first SlamBall draft in 2002 saw Canadian Robert Wilson drafted as the first No. 1 pick ever in the sport.
Before the second season of SlamBall debuted on the newly renamed Spike TV, two expansion teams (the Riders and Bandits) were added and a new court was built at Universal City, California.
In 2007, the &quot;POWERADE SlamBall Challenge&quot; took place at Hoop City, a fan interactive event, at the 2007 Final Four in Atlanta, Georgia, and aired on CSTV in April 2007.

In Italy SlamBall made its debut on Italia 1 on 16 July 2007.

In 2008, SlamBall began planning for a new season, to be financed by IMG. The league accepted applications through its website for new players and coaches, and tryouts were held in three U.S. cities in April, 2008. A training camp for the 2008 season of SlamBall was held at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida from April to June 2008. Over 100 potential players participated in tryouts, eventually leaving 64 players after an 8-team draft. The league was cut to the 6 current teams. Some figures associated with the new season of SlamBall include: Commissioner Pat Croce and Coaches Kenny Anderson, John Starks, Raghib Ismail and Ken Carter. In summer 2008, SlamBall played its first season since 2003 at Universal Citywalk in Universal Studios, California. These games aired in a &quot;Game of the Week&quot; format on Versus beginning 31 August and led up to the finals on CBS on 2 November 2008.

In the 2008 season championship, the Slashers, led by Kevin Stapleton, defeated the Rumble. The coach of the Rumble was Ken Carter, of the famed Coach Carter. The season aired on Australia&#x27;s One HD and Fuel TV.

=== SlamBall in China (2012–2016) ===
In 2012, SlamBall resurfaced in China, with the fourth series taking place in Hangzhou, and the formation of the Multinational SlamBall Athletic Association (MSAA) to scout and develop players from China.

After what appeared to be an extended courtship with the Chinese government, and community at large, new SlamBall facilities began construction in China. Eventually, the new partnership with Chinese entities created five teams to officially expand the league to Asia. SlamBall creator Mason Gordon played a significant role in advancing the process. In 2015 SlamBall started capturing the attention of the Chinese public. A fifth series was held in 2016 at venues in Beijing and Wuhan. 

According to a report published by Vice Sports, Mason Gordon was quoted as saying, &quot;We never left, we just needed to take the best path for us.&quot;

=== Current league (2023–present) ===
In August 2022, Mason Gordon announced that SlamBall would be returning in July 2023 as a live sports league. The league raised a $11M Series A funding round led by Roger Ehrenberg, with participation from David Blitzer, Michael Rubin, Gary Vaynerchuk, and Blake Griffin. The younger generation is their target audience.

The 2023 SlamBall Season would take place in Las Vegas for a six-week season followed by a seventh week for playoffs, with eight teams competing. On June 5, SlamBall Mini Camp officially started with the &quot;Super 24&quot;, where 24 selected groups of multi-sport athletes trained for two weeks of training, leading up to the SlamBall Draft where the eight teams would draft 56 players. Florida A&amp;M University alumnus Bryce Moragne was selected as the first overall pick.

On June 21, SlamBall and ESPN announced an exclusive two-year broadcast partnership to air over 30 hours of games on ESPN, ESPN2, and ESPN+, with the opening night of the 2023 season set for July 21. A new logo for the league was unveiled on June 22, and on June 27, the names and logos of the eight teams participating in the rebooted league were publicly revealed. The Mob, Rumble, and Slashers names were carried over from the previous seasons of SlamBall, accompanied by five new teams - the Gryphons, Ozone, Lava, Wrath, and Buzzsaw.

==Rules and regulations==
Scoring is achieved by putting the ball into the net at the opponent&#x27;s end of the court for points. Both teams simultaneously try to score points and prevent the opponent from scoring. The aim is to have outscored the opposing team when the game ends. A successful score can be worth two points if the ball is thrown through the hoop without the offensive player touching the hoop. Slam dunks are scored three points. All shots outside the three-point arc are worth three points as well. In the 2023 revival, there is a four-point arc measuring from the basket. It replaces the original three-point arc. Four players from each team (out of an 8-10 player roster) may be on the court at one time. Substitutions are unlimited and can be done during play (as in the game of hockey). Each team has a coach and additional staff which includes assistant coaches, managers, statisticians, doctors, etc.

The game is controlled by two referees and the table officials. The table keeps track of the score, time, team possessions, fouls and the shot clock.

==Playing regulations==
Games are played in four 5-minute quarters, unlike the NBA, which plays for four 12-minute quarters. The game commences with &quot;The Throwdown&quot; - A &quot;bounce-off&quot; in which the ball is bounced at center court. The ball must reach its apex uninterrupted, at which point the players are allowed to &quot;check&quot; each other. Ten minutes are allowed for a half-time break; only one time-out is permitted to each team, which may only be used during the last two minutes of regulation play. A 20-second shot clock is utilized. Teams change ends for the second half. A tie score at the end of regulation time is settled by a series of &quot;face offs&quot; (see Fouls below).

==Positions==
Each team has four players on the court at any one time. There are three positions:

*Handler: This is the primary ball handler on the team. It is his job to run the offense and organize the other members while controlling the flow of the game. Typically he would be responsible to set up the gunners to attack the basket while adding in his own offensive threat, comparable to a point guard in basketball.
*Gunner: The primary scorer on the team. A team&#x27;s gunner will be the player on the team that will attack the basket and finish plays against the opposing teams&#x27; stopper, comparable to a forward or wing player in soccer or hockey. 
*Stopper: This position is for the primary defensive player. He trails the offense only when necessary, and he protects the rim from attacking players by using himself as a shield. Goaltending is legal if the shot attempt is from inside the trampoline area.

Teams are free to choose their own configuration, the usual formations being either 1 stopper, 2 handlers, and 1 gunner or 1 stopper, 1 handler, and 2 gunners.

==Fouls==
Each player can commit just three personal fouls before he is removed from the match (the match is 20 minutes; a FIBA-organised 40-minute game allows five, and a 48-minute game such as the NBA is six). A coach or player displaying poor sportsmanship (such as fighting, arguing vehemently against an official) may be charged with a technical foul. Two technical fouls results in a disqualification.

When a foul is called, the player who has committed it will then take position on the baseline of the lower trampolines while the player who was offended will take up offensive position at center court. This is called a &quot;face-off&quot;. Upon a signal from the referee the offensive player will be free to mount an attack at the basket, which the defender now must endeavor to stop. The defender must enter the lower trampoline only after bouncing in from the side trampoline. If the offensive player is successful, then points will be awarded depending on the shot converted and the offensive players&#x27; team will retain possession of the ball. In the case of any tie-ups, the defensive team always gain possession, but if the shot was blocked, the offensive team retains the ball from center court.

List of common fouls:
#When an offensive player has the ball and a defensive player checks him in the back. Result: Faceoff
#When an offensive player has the ball and a defensive player checks him before he has begun to dribble the ball. Result: Faceoff
#When an offensive player has the ball and a defensive player checks him while he is attempting to enter the trampoline. Result: Faceoff
#When two offensive players step/bounce on the same trampoline. Result: Turnover
#When an offensive player bounces on a trampoline twice while in possession of the ball. Result: Turnover
#When either a Player or the Coach of a team argues with the referee and uses physical or verbal abuse in anger. Result: Can either be a Faceoff or Turnover (referee decides)
#When two players from the same team are on the same island or trampoline, or &#x27;station&#x27; as it is called. Result: Turnover
#Three-second violation: When any offensive player is stationed in an island area (sides of trampolines) for three seconds. Result: Turnover
#When a shot is attempted from an island. Result: Turnover
#When the defense holds position on an island, a charge can be called against the opposition. Result: Turnover.
#&quot;Popcorn effect&quot;: When a defensive player deliberately interferes with the offensive player&#x27;s bounce, caused by standing on the offensive player&#x27;s landing spot to cause the equivalent of a trip in basketball. Result: Faceoff

==Equipment==

The spring floor lies adjacent to two sets of four trampolines or spring bed &#x27;quads&#x27; which dominate each end of the court. Each trampoline surface measures . The shock absorbent panels pair with the competition bed trampolines to create a playing surface that both launches players into the air and cushions their landing upon returning to the floor. Specifically engineered pads are designed to cover the frame rails and their tapered design allows for safety for on-court play. This entire playing surface will be surrounded with an Plexiglass wall much like in a hockey rink. Players wear protective cups and special equipment to protect various areas of the body. This consists of knee and elbow pads, and an optional SlamBall-specific helmet.

In the 2023 revival, however, scrum cap-style helmets are mandatory for all players. Game can still continue if it is removed during play, but they cannot participate on defense in the trampoline area. Gloves are optional.

==Media exposure==
On television, the sport has been seen on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, CBS&#x27;s &quot;King of Queens&quot;, &quot;Method &amp; Red&quot;, &quot;ESPN&#x27;s SportsCenter&quot;, &quot;The Best Damn Sports Show Period&quot; and &quot;Fuel TV&quot;. In print, SlamBall has been featured in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; and European editions of &quot;Maxim&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot; and &quot;FHM&quot;.

==Athletes and training==
Because of the nature of SlamBall, a broad scope is considered in the recruitment of the players. New players for the League have come from various areas. SlamBall has recruited players directly from college and pro basketball programs across the country, Football players are used to the full-contact, up-tempo style of play, and many players of SlamBall found their origins on the gridiron.

<doc id="470280" wikidata="Q8019063" url="?curid=470280" title="William T. Fitzsimons">
<text>Lieutenant William Thomas Fitzsimons (April 18, 1889 – September 4, 1917) was an American physician and United States Army officer in World War I, and is considered the first American officer killed in the war. Fitzsimons was born in Burlington, Kansas on April 18, 1889 to J.I. and Catherine Fitzsimons. Fitzsimons graduated with a Doctor of Medicine degree from the in 1912 and was a member of the Beta Theta chapter of Nu Sigma Nu.

When the U.S. entered World War I, Fitzsimons was called into active duty. He volunteered for overseas duty and left Kansas City on June 14, 1917. He was assigned to U.S. Army Base Hospital No. 5, which was associated with the British Expeditionary Forces near Dannes-Camiers, France.

Fitzsimons was killed in a German air raid on September 4, 1917 along with Pvt. Oscar Tugo, Pvt. Rudolph Rubino and Pvt. Leslie Woods, when bombs fell on Base Hospital No. 5 near Dannes-Camiers in Pas-de-Calais, France. He was laid to rest in the afternoon of September 5, 1917 with full military honors in the British cemetery at Etaples along with the three enlisted men who also perished. His body was later moved to the U.S. Cemetery at Bony-Aisne.

On July 1, 1920, Army Hospital 21 in Aurora, Colorado was officially renamed the Fitzsimons Army Hospital in his honor by direction of the War Department. In 1955, PFC Albert T. Beinar was commissioned to paint a portrait of Lt. Fitzsimons. His painting was unveiled by Mamie Eisenhower during the seven-week stay of Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s heart attack recovery.

<doc id="470281" wikidata="Q1262196" url="?curid=470281" title="Allamanda">
<text>Allamanda is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. They are native to the Americas, where they are distributed from Mexico to Argentina. Some species are familiar as ornamental plants cultivated for their large, colorful flowers. Most species produce yellow flowers; &quot;A. blanchetii&quot; bears pink flowers. The genus name &quot;Allamanda&quot; honors the Swiss botanist and physician Frédéric-Louis Allamand (1736–1809). It is the official flower of Kuching North City Hall.

==Description==
Plants of the genus are evergreen trees, shrubs, or vines. They contain a white latex. The leaves are opposite or arranged in whorls of up to 5. The blades are generally oval and smooth-edged, and some are leathery or lightly hairy. The inflorescence is a compound cyme. The flower has five lobed sepals and a bell- or funnel-shaped corolla of five petals, yellow in most species. The fruit is a schizocarp containing two to four seeds.

==Chemistry and medicine==
In lab analyses &quot;Allamanda&quot; species have yielded several chemical compounds, including iridoid lactones such as allamandin, plumericin, and plumierides. Plumericin particularly was demonstrated to be a highly potent NF-κB inhibitor with anti-inflammatory activity &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot;, while its structurally related derivatives plumierdin, plumeridoid C, and allamandicin did not have activity. The lignan pinoresinol and coumarins such as scopoletin and scoparone have been isolated from &quot;A. schottii&quot;.

&quot;Allamanda&quot; species have been used in systems of traditional medicine for various purposes. &quot;A. cathartica&quot; has been used to treat liver tumors, jaundice, splenomegaly, and malaria. In analyses, some species have shown some activity against carcinoma cells, pathogenic fungi, and HIV.

In June 2022 a research team in the Gunung Leuser National Park, Sumatra, Indonesia, observed an orangutan chewing the stem and leaves of this plant, locally known as akar kuning, and applying the resulting paste and chewed leaves to a serious wound on its face. This is considered the first time a non-human species was seen deliberately preparing and applying medicine. After five days, the wound had closed, and fully healed three weeks later.

==Cultivation==
In the wild, allamandas grow along riverbanks and other open, sunny areas with adequate rainfall and perpetually moist substrate. The plants do not tolerate shade or salty or alkaline soils, and they are sensitive to frost. They grow rapidly, sometimes spreading 3 meters per year. They can be propagated from cuttings.

Can be trained as a standard.

==Ecology==
Allamandas have become naturalized throughout the tropics, growing in roadside ditches, abandoned yards, and dumps. &quot;A. cathartica&quot; in particular is an invasive species in Queensland. Cutting is ineffective as a means of control, because the plants respond to coppicing.

==Taxonomy==
There are about 12 to 15 valid species in the genus.

Species and synonyms include:

*&quot;Allamanda angustifolia&quot; 
*&quot;Allamanda blanchetii&quot; – purple allamanda, violet allamanda, violet trumpetvine
*&quot;Allamanda calcicola&quot;
*&quot;Allamanda cathartica&quot; – yellow allamanda, golden-trumpet, common trumpetvine brownbud allamanda
*&quot;Allamanda doniana&quot; 
*&quot;Allamanda laevis&quot; 
*&quot;Allamanda martii&quot; 
*&quot;Allamanda nobilis&quot; 
*&quot;Allamanda oenotherifolia&quot; 
*&quot;Allamanda polyantha&quot; 
*&quot;Allamanda puberula&quot; 
*&quot;Allamanda schottii&quot; – bush allamanda
*&quot;Allamanda setulosa&quot; 
*&quot;Allamanda thevetifolia&quot; 
*&quot;Allamanda weberbaueri&quot;

<text>Transcortin, also known as corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) or serpin A6, is a protein produced in the liver in animals. In humans it is encoded by the SERPINA6 gene. It is an alpha-globulin.

== Function ==
This gene encodes an alpha-globulin protein with corticosteroid-binding properties. This is the major transport protein for glucocorticoids and progestins in the blood of most vertebrates. The gene localizes to a chromosomal region containing several closely related serine protease inhibitors (serpins).

==Binding==
Transcortin binds several steroid hormones at high rates:
* Cortisol - Approximately 90% of the cortisol in circulation is bound to transcortin. (The rest is bound to serum albumin.) Cortisol is thought to be biologically active only when it is not bound to transcortin.
* Cortisone
* Deoxycorticosterone (DOC)
* Corticosterone - About 78% of serum corticosterone is bound to transcortin.
* Aldosterone - Approximately 17% of serum aldosterone is bound to transcortin, while another 47% is bound to serum albumin. The remaining 36% is free.
* Progesterone - Approximately 18% of serum progesterone is bound to transcortin, while another 80% of it is bound to serum albumin. The remaining 2% is free.
* 17α-Hydroxyprogesterone

In addition, approximately 4% of serum testosterone is bound to transcortin. A similarly small fraction of serum estradiol is bound to transcortin as well.

== Synthesis ==
Transcortin is produced by the liver and is increased by estrogens.

== Clinical significance ==
Mutations in this gene are rare. Only four mutations have been described, often in association with fatigue and chronic pain. This mechanism for these symptoms is not known. This condition must be distinguished from secondary hypocortisolism. Exogenous hydrocortisone does not appear to improve the fatigue.

Hepatic synthesis of corticosteroid-binding globulin more than doubles in pregnancy; that is, bound plasma cortisol in term pregnancy is approximately 2 to 3 times that of nonpregnant women.

<doc id="470286" wikidata="Q828879" url="?curid=470286" title="Gestalt therapy">
<text>Gestalt therapy is a form of psychotherapy that emphasizes personal responsibility and focuses on the individual&#x27;s experience in the present moment, the therapist–client relationship, the environmental and social contexts of a person&#x27;s life, and the self-regulating adjustments people make as a result of their overall situation. It was developed by Fritz Perls, Laura Perls and Paul Goodman in the 1940s and 1950s, and was first described in the 1951 book &quot;Gestalt Therapy&quot;.

==Overview==
Edwin Nevis, co-founder of the Gestalt Institute of Cleveland, founder of the Gestalt International Study Center, and faculty member at the MIT Sloan School of Management, described Gestalt therapy as &quot;a conceptual and methodological base from which helping professionals can craft their practice&quot;. In the same volume, Joel Latner stated that Gestalt therapy is built upon two central ideas:
# that the most helpful focus of psychotherapy is the experiential present moment, and that everyone is caught in webs of relationships;
# thus, it is only possible to know ourselves against the background of our relationships to others.
The historical development of Gestalt therapy (described below) discloses the influences that generated these two ideas. Expanded, they support the four chief theoretical constructs (explained in the theory and practice section) that comprise Gestalt theory, and that guide the practice and application of Gestalt therapy.

Gestalt therapy was forged from various influences upon the lives of its founders during the times in which they lived, including the new physics, Eastern religion, existential phenomenology, Gestalt psychology, psychoanalysis, experimental theatre, systems theory, and field theory. Gestalt therapy rose from its beginnings in the middle of the 20th century to rapid and widespread popularity during the decade of the 1960s and early 1970s. During the 1970s and 80s Gestalt therapy training centers spread globally; but they were, for the most part, not aligned with formal academic settings. As the cognitive revolution eclipsed Gestalt theory in psychology, many came to believe Gestalt was an anachronism. Because Gestalt therapists disdained the positivism underlying what they perceived to be the concern of research, they largely ignored the need to use research to further develop Gestalt theory and Gestalt therapy practice (with a few exceptions like Les Greenberg; see the interview &quot;Validating Gestalt&quot;). However, the new century has seen a sea change in attitudes toward research and Gestalt practice. In March 2020, Vikram Kolmannskog became the world&#x27;s first Professor of Gestalt Therapy at the Norwegian Gestalt Institute, where he has been teaching and researching since 2015.

Gestalt therapy is not identical to Gestalt psychology, but Gestalt psychology influenced the development of Gestalt therapy to a large extent.

Gestalt therapy focuses on process (what is actually happening) over content (what is being talked about). The emphasis is on what is being done, thought, and felt at the present moment (the phenomenality of both client and therapist), rather than on what was, might be, could be, or should have been. Gestalt therapy is a method of awareness practice (also called &quot;mindfulness&quot; in other clinical domains), by which perceiving, feeling, and acting are understood to be conducive to interpreting, explaining, and conceptualizing (the hermeneutics of experience). This distinction between direct experience versus indirect or secondary interpretation is developed in the process of therapy. The client learns to become aware of what they are doing and that triggers the ability to risk a shift or change.

The objective of Gestalt therapy is to enable the client to become more fully and creatively alive and to become free from the blocks and unfinished business that may diminish satisfaction, fulfillment, and growth, and to experiment with new ways of being. For this reason Gestalt therapy falls within the category of humanistic psychotherapies. As Gestalt therapy includes perception and the meaning-making processes by which experience forms, it can also be considered a cognitive approach. Also, because Gestalt therapy relies on the contact between therapist and client, and because a relationship can be considered to be contact over time, Gestalt therapy can be considered a relational or interpersonal approach. As it appreciates the larger picture which is the complex situation involving multiple influences in a complex situation, it can also be considered a multi-systemic approach. In addition, the processes of Gestalt therapy are experimental, involving action, Gestalt therapy can be considered both a paradoxical and an experiential/experimental approach.

When Gestalt therapy is compared to other clinical domains, a person can find many matches, or points of similarity. &quot;Probably the clearest case of consilience is between gestalt therapy&#x27;s field perspective and the various organismic and field theories that proliferated in neuroscience, medicine, and physics in the early and mid-20th century. Within social science there is a consilience between gestalt field theory and systems or ecological psychotherapy; between the concept of dialogical relationship and object relations, attachment theory, client-centered therapy and the transference-oriented approaches; between the existential, phenomenological, and hermeneutical aspects of gestalt therapy and the constructivist aspects of cognitive therapy; and between gestalt therapy&#x27;s commitment to awareness and the natural processes of healing and mindfulness, acceptance and Buddhist techniques adopted by cognitive behavioral therapy.&quot;

==Contemporary theory and practice==
The theoretical foundations of Gestalt therapy essentially rest atop four &quot;load-bearing walls&quot;: phenomenological method, dialogical relationship, field-theoretical strategies, and experimental freedom. Although all these tenets were present in the early formulation and practice of Gestalt therapy, as described in &quot;Ego, Hunger and Aggression&quot; (Perls, 1947) and in &quot;Gestalt Therapy, Excitement and Growth in the Human Personality&quot; (Perls, Hefferline, &amp; Goodman, 1951), the early development of Gestalt therapy theory emphasized personal experience and the experiential episodes understood as &quot;safe emergencies&quot; or experiments. Indeed, half of the Perls, Hefferline, and Goodman book consists of such experiments. Later, through the influence of such people as Erving and Miriam Polster, a second theoretical emphasis emerged: namely, contact between self and other, and ultimately the dialogical relationship between therapist and client. Later still, field theory emerged as an emphasis. At various times over the decades, since Gestalt therapy first emerged, one or more of these tenets and the associated constructs that go with them have captured the imagination of those who have continued developing the contemporary theory of Gestalt therapy. Since 1990 the literature focused upon Gestalt therapy has flourished, including the development of several professional Gestalt journals. Along the way, Gestalt therapy theory has also been applied in Organizational Development and coaching work. And, more recently, Gestalt methods have been combined with meditation practices into a unified program of human development called Gestalt Practice, which is used by some practitioners.

Richard G. Erskine, the originator of Integrative Psychotherapy (Developmentally Based, Relationally Focused), has written about the treatment of shame and self-righteousness in &quot;A Gestalt therapy approach to shame and self-righteousness: theory and methods&quot; from his book Relational Patterns, Therapeutic Presence: Concepts and Practice of Integrative Psychotherapy (2015).

===Phenomenological method===
The goal of a phenomenological exploration is awareness. This exploration works systematically to reduce the effects of bias through repeated observations and inquiry.

The phenomenological method comprises three steps:
# Applying the rule of epoché - one sets aside one&#x27;s initial biases and prejudices in order to suspend expectations and assumptions.
# Applying the rule of description - one occupies oneself with describing instead of explaining.
# Applying the rule of horizontalization - one treats each item of description as having equal value or significance.

The rule of epoché sets aside any initial theories with regard to what is presented in the meeting between therapist and client. The rule of description implies immediate and specific observations, abstaining from interpretations or explanations, especially those formed from the application of a clinical theory superimposed over the circumstances of experience. The rule of horizontalization avoids any hierarchical assignment of importance such that the data of experience become prioritized and categorized as they are received. A Gestalt therapist using the phenomenological method might say something like, &quot;I notice a slight tension at the corners of your mouth when I say that, and I see you shifting on the couch and folding your arms across your chest ... and now I see you rolling your eyes back&quot;. Of course, the therapist may make a clinically relevant evaluation, but when applying the phenomenological method, temporarily suspends the need to express it.

===Dialogical relationship===
To create the conditions under which a dialogic moment might occur, the therapist attends to their own presence, creates the space for the client to enter in and become present as well (called inclusion), and commits themself to the dialogic process, surrendering to what takes place, as opposed to attempting to control it. With presence, the therapist judiciously &quot;shows up&quot; as a whole and authentic person, instead of assuming a role, false self or persona. To be judicious, the therapist takes into account the specific strengths, weaknesses and values of the client. The only good client is a live client, so driving a client away by injudicious exposure of intolerable [to this client] experience of the therapist is obviously counter-productive. For example, for an atheistic therapist to tell a devout client that religion is myth would not be useful, especially in the early stages of the relationship. To practice inclusion is to accept however the client chooses to be present, whether in a defensive and obnoxious stance or a superficially cooperative one. To practice inclusion is to support the presence of the client, including their resistance, not as a gimmick but in full realization that this is how the client is actually present and is the best this client can do at this time. Finally, the Gestalt therapist is committed to the process, trusts in that process, and does not attempt to save themself from it.

===Field-theoretical strategies===
Field theory is a concept borrowed from physics in which people and events are no longer considered discrete units but as parts of something larger, which are influenced by everything including the past, and observation itself. &quot;The field&quot; can be considered in two ways. There are ontological dimensions and there are phenomenological dimensions to one&#x27;s field. The ontological dimensions are all those physical and environmental contexts in which we live and move. They might be the office in which one works, the house in which one lives, the city and country of which one is a citizen, and so forth. The ontological field is the objective reality that supports our physical existence. The phenomenological dimensions are all mental and physical dynamics that contribute to a person&#x27;s sense of self, one&#x27;s subjective experience—not merely elements of the environmental context. These might be the memory of an uncle&#x27;s inappropriate affection, one&#x27;s color blindness, one&#x27;s sense of the social matrix in operation at the office in which one works, and so forth. The way that Gestalt therapists choose to work with field dynamics makes what they do strategic. Gestalt therapy focuses upon character structure; according to Gestalt theory, the character structure is dynamic rather than fixed in nature. To become aware of one&#x27;s character structure, the focus is upon the phenomenological dimensions in the context of the ontological dimensions.

===Experimental freedom===
Gestalt therapy is distinct because it moves toward action, away from mere talk therapy, and for this reason is considered an experiential approach. Through experiments, the therapist supports the client&#x27;s direct experience of something new, instead of merely talking about the possibility of something new. Indeed, the entire therapeutic relationship may be considered experimental, because at one level it is a corrective, relational experience for many clients, and it is a &quot;safe emergency&quot; that is free to turn out however it will. An experiment can also be conceived as a teaching method that creates an experience in which a client might learn something as part of their growth.
Examples might include:
* Rather than talking about the client&#x27;s critical parent, a Gestalt therapist might ask the client to imagine the parent is present, or that the therapist is the parent, and talk to that parent directly
* If a client is struggling with how to be assertive, a Gestalt therapist could either:
** have the client say some assertive things to the therapist or members of a therapy group
** give a talk about how one should never be assertive
* A Gestalt therapist might notice something about the non-verbal behavior or tone of voice of the client; then the therapist might have the client exaggerate the non-verbal behavior and pay attention to that experience
* A Gestalt therapist might work with the breathing or posture of the client, and direct awareness to changes that might happen when the client talks about different content.
With all these experiments the Gestalt therapist is working with process rather than content, the &quot;how&quot; rather than the &quot;what&quot;.

==Noteworthy issues==
===Self===
In field theory, &quot;self&quot; is a phenomenological concept, existing in comparison with &quot;other&quot;. Without the other there is no self, and how one experiences the other is inseparable from how one experiences oneself. The continuity of &quot;selfhood&quot; (functioning personality) is something that is achieved in relationship, rather than something inherently &quot;inside&quot; the person. This can have its advantages and disadvantages. At one end of the spectrum, someone may not have enough self-continuity to be able to make meaningful relationships, or to have a workable sense of who they are. In the middle, their personality is a loose set of ways of being that work for them, including commitments to relationships, work, culture and outlook, always open to change where they need to adapt to new circumstances or just want to try something new. At the other end, their personality is a rigid defensive denial of the new and spontaneous. They act in stereotyped ways, and either induce other people to act in particular and fixed ways towards them, or they redefine their actions to fit with fixed stereotypes.

In Gestalt therapy, the process is not about the self of the client being helped or healed by the fixed self of the therapist; rather it is an exploration of the co-creation of self and other in the here-and-now of the therapy. There is no assumption that the client will act in all other circumstances as they do in the therapy situation. However, the areas that cause problems will be either the lack of self-definition leading to chaotic or psychotic behaviour, or the rigid self-definition in some area of functioning that denies spontaneity and makes dealing with particular situations impossible. Both of these conditions show up very clearly in the therapy, and can be worked with in the relationship with the therapist.

The experience of the therapist is also very much part of the therapy. Since we co-create our self-other experiences, the way a therapist experiences being with a client is significant information about how the client experiences themselves. The proviso here is that a therapist is not operating from their own fixed responses. This is why Gestalt therapists are required to undertake significant therapy of their own during training.

From the perspective of this theory of self, neurosis can be seen as fixed predictability—a fixed Gestalt—and the process of therapy can be seen as &quot;facilitating the client to become unpredictable&quot;: more responsive to what is in the client&#x27;s present environment, rather than responding in a stuck way to past introjects or other learning. If the therapist has expectations of how the client should end up, this defeats the aim of therapy.

===Change===
In what has now become a classic of Gestalt therapy literature, Arnold R. Beisser described Gestalt&#x27;s paradoxical theory of change. The paradox is that the more one attempts to be who one is not, the more one remains the same. Conversely, when people identify with their current experience, the conditions of wholeness and growth support change. Put another way, change comes about as a result of &quot;full acceptance of what is, rather than a striving to be different.&quot;

===Empty chair technique===
Empty chair technique or chairwork is typically used in Gestalt therapy when a patient might have deep-rooted emotional problems from someone or something in their life, such as relationships with themselves, with aspects of their personality, their concepts, ideas, feelings, etc., or other people in their lives. The purpose of this technique is to get the patient to think about their emotions and attitudes. Common things the patient addresses in the empty chair are another person, aspects of their own personality, a certain feeling, etc., as if that thing were in that chair. They may also move between chairs and act out two or more sides of a discussion, typically involving the patient and persons significant to them. It uses a passive approach to opening up the patient&#x27;s emotions and pent-up feelings so they can let go of what they have been holding back. A form of role-playing, the technique focuses on exploration of self and is used by therapists to help patients self-adjust. Gestalt techniques were originally a form of psychotherapy, but are now often used in counseling, for instance, by encouraging clients to act out their feelings helping them prepare for a new job. The purpose of the technique is so the patient will become more in touch with their feelings and have an emotional conversation that clears up any long-held feelings or reaction to the person or object in the chair.

==Historical development==
Fritz Perls was a German-Jewish psychoanalyst who fled Europe with his wife Laura Perls to South Africa in order to escape Nazi oppression in 1933. After World War II, the couple emigrated to New York City, which had become a center of intellectual, artistic and political experimentation by the late 1940s and early 1950s.

===Early influences===
Perls grew up on the bohemian scene in Berlin, participated in Expressionism and Dadaism, and experienced the turning of the artistic &quot;avant-garde&quot; toward the revolutionary left. Deployment to the front line, the trauma of war, anti-Semitism, intimidation, escape, and the Holocaust are further key sources of biographical influence.

Perls served in the German Army during World War I, and was wounded in the conflict. After the war he was educated as a medical doctor. He became an assistant to Kurt Goldstein, who worked with brain-injured soldiers. Perls went through a psychoanalysis with Wilhelm Reich and became a psychiatrist. Perls assisted Goldstein at Frankfurt University where he met his wife Lore (Laura) Posner, who had earned a doctorate in Gestalt psychology. They fled Nazi Germany in 1933 and settled in South Africa. Perls established a psychoanalytic training institute and joined the South African armed forces, serving as a military psychiatrist. During these years in South Africa, Perls was influenced by Jan Smuts and his ideas about &quot;holism&quot;.

In 1936 Fritz Perls attended a psychoanalysts&#x27; conference in Marienbad, Czechoslovakia, where he presented a paper on oral resistances, mainly based on Laura Perls&#x27;s notes on breastfeeding their children. Perls&#x27;s paper was turned down. Perls did present his paper in 1936, but according to him, it met with &quot;deep disapproval.&quot; Perls wrote his first book, &quot;Ego, Hunger and Aggression&quot; (1942, 1947), in South Africa, based in part on the rejected paper. It was later re-published in the United States. Laura Perls wrote two chapters of this book, but she was not given adequate recognition for her work.

===Seminal book===
Perls&#x27;s seminal work was &quot;Gestalt Therapy: Excitement and Growth in the Human Personality&quot;, published in 1951, co-authored by Fritz Perls, Paul Goodman, and Ralph Hefferline (a university psychology professor and sometimes-patient of Fritz Perls). Most of Part II of the book was written by Paul Goodman from Perls&#x27;s notes, and it contains the core of Gestalt theory. This part was supposed to appear first, but the publishers decided that Part I, written by Hefferline, fit into the nascent self-help ethos of the day, and they made it an introduction to the theory. Isadore From, a leading early theorist of Gestalt therapy, taught Goodman&#x27;s Part II for an entire year to his students, going through it phrase by phrase.

===First instances of Gestalt therapy===
Fritz and Laura founded the first Gestalt Institute in 1952, running it out of their Manhattan apartment. Isadore From became a patient, first of Fritz, and then of Laura. Fritz soon made From a trainer, and also gave him some patients. From lived in New York until his death, at age seventy-five, in 1993. He was known worldwide for his philosophical and intellectually rigorous take on Gestalt therapy. Acknowledged as a supremely gifted clinician, he was indisposed to writing, so what remains of his work is merely transcripts of interviews.

Of great importance to understanding the development of Gestalt therapy is the early training which took place in experiential groups in the Perls&#x27;s apartment, led by both Fritz and Laura before Fritz left for the West Coast, and after by Laura alone. These &quot;trainings&quot; were unstructured, with little didactic input from the leaders, although many of the principles were discussed in the monthly meetings of the institute, as well as at local bars after the sessions. Many notable Gestalt therapists emerged from these crucibles in addition to Isadore From, e.g., Richard Kitzler, Dan Bloom, Bud Feder, Carl Hodges, and Ruth Ronall. In these sessions, both Fritz and Laura used some variation of the &quot;hot seat&quot; method, in which the leader essentially works with one individual in front of an audience with little or no attention to group dynamics. In reaction to this omission emerged a more interactive approach in which Gestalt-therapy principles were blended with group dynamics; in 1980, the book &quot;Beyond the Hot Seat&quot;, edited by Feder and Ronall, was published, with contributions from members of both the New York and Cleveland Institutes, as well as others.

Fritz left Laura and New York in 1960, briefly lived in Miami, and ended up in California. Jim Simkin was a psychotherapist who became a client of Perls in New York and then a co-therapist with Perls in Los Angeles. Simkin was responsible for Perls&#x27;s going to California, where Perls began a psychotherapy practice. Ultimately, the life of a peripatetic trainer and workshop leader was better suited to Fritz&#x27;s personality—starting in 1963, Simkin and Perls co-led some of the early Gestalt workshops and training groups at Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California, where Perls eventually settled and built a home. Jim Simkin then purchased property next to Esalen and started his own training center, which he ran until his death in 1984. Simkin refined his precise version of Gestalt therapy, training psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors and social workers within a very rigorous, residential training model.

===Schism===
In the 1960s, Perls became infamous among the professional elite for his public workshops at Esalen Institute. Isadore From referred to some of Fritz&#x27;s brief workshops as &quot;hit-and-run&quot; therapy, because of Perls&#x27;s alleged emphasis on showmanship with little or no follow-through—but Perls never considered these workshops to be complete therapy; rather, he felt he was giving &quot;demonstrations of key points&quot; for a largely professional audience. Unfortunately, some films and tapes of his work were all that most graduate students were exposed to, along with the misperception that these represented the entirety of Perls&#x27;s work.

When Fritz Perls left New York for California, there began to be a split with those who saw Gestalt therapy as a therapeutic approach similar to psychoanalysis. This view was represented by Isadore From, who practiced and taught mainly in New York, as well as by the members of the Cleveland Institute, which was co-founded by From. An entirely different approach was taken, primarily in California, by those who saw Gestalt therapy not just as a therapeutic modality, but as a way of life. The East Coast, New York–Cleveland axis was often appalled by the notion of Gestalt therapy leaving the consulting room and becoming a way of life on the West Coast in the 1960s (see the &quot;Gestalt prayer&quot;).

An alternative view of this split saw Perls in his last years continuing to develop his a-theoretical and phenomenological methodology, while others, inspired by From, were inclined to theoretical rigor which verged on replacing experience with ideas.

The split continues between what has been called &quot;East Coast Gestalt&quot; and &quot;West Coast Gestalt,&quot; at least from an Amerocentric point of view. While the communitarian form of Gestalt continues to flourish, Gestalt therapy was largely replaced in the United States by cognitive behavioral therapy, and many Gestalt therapists in the U.S. drifted toward organizational management and coaching. At the same time, contemporary Gestalt Practice (to a large extent based upon Gestalt therapy theory and practice) was developed by Dick Price, the co-founder of Esalen Institute. Price was one of Perls&#x27;s students at Esalen.

===Post-Perls===
In 1969, Fritz Perls left the United States to start a Gestalt community at Lake Cowichan on Vancouver Island, Canada. He died almost one year later, on 14 March 1970, in Chicago. One member of the Gestalt community was Barry Stevens. Her book about that phase of her life, &quot;Don&#x27;t Push the River&quot;, became very popular. She developed her own form of Gestalt therapy body work, which is essentially a concentration on the awareness of body processes.

====Polsters====
Erving and Miriam Polster started a training center in La Jolla, California, and published a book, &quot;Gestalt Therapy Integrated&quot;, in the 1970s.

They were influential in advancing the idea of contact boundary phenomena, which is a key part of Gestalt theory. The standard contact boundary resistances were confluence, introjection, projection, and retroflection, but the Polsters added &quot;deflection&quot; as a way of avoiding contact. Boundary phenomena can have good or bad effects, depending on the situation. For example, it&#x27;s normal for a baby and mother to merge, but not for a therapist and client. If the therapist and client become too merged, then there can be no progress because there is no boundary for them to connect with. The client will not be able to learn anything new because the therapist will just become a part of them.

==Influences upon Gestalt therapy==
===Some examples===
There were a variety of psychological and philosophical influences upon the development of Gestalt therapy, not the least of which were the social forces at the time and place of its inception. Gestalt therapy is an approach that is holistic (including mind, body, and culture). It is present-centered and related to existential therapy in its emphasis on personal responsibility for action, and on the value of &quot;I–thou&quot; relationship in therapy. In fact, Perls considered calling Gestalt therapy &quot;existential-phenomenological therapy&quot;. &quot;The I and thou in the Here and Now&quot; was a semi-humorous shorthand mantra for Gestalt therapy, referring to the substantial influence of the work of Martin Buber—in particular his notion of the I–Thou relationship—on Perls and Gestalt. Buber&#x27;s work emphasized immediacy, and required that any method or theory answer to the therapeutic situation, seen as a meeting between two people. Any process or method that turns the patient into an object (the I–It) must be strictly secondary to the intimate, and spontaneous, I–Thou relation. This concept became important in much of Gestalt theory and practice.

Both Fritz and Laura Perls were students and admirers of the neuropsychiatrist Kurt Goldstein. Gestalt therapy was based in part on Goldstein&#x27;s concept called &quot;Organismic theory&quot;. Goldstein viewed a person in terms of a holistic and unified experience; he encouraged a &quot;big picture&quot; perspective, taking into account the whole context of a person&#x27;s experience. The word &quot;Gestalt&quot; means whole, or configuration. Laura Perls, in an interview, denotes the Organismic theory as the base of Gestalt therapy.

There were additional influences on Gestalt therapy from existentialism, particularly the emphasis upon personal choice and responsibility.

The late 1950s–1960s movement toward personal growth and the human potential movement in California fed into, and was itself influenced by, Gestalt therapy. In this process Gestalt therapy somehow became a &quot;coherent Gestalt&quot;, which is the Gestalt psychology term for a perceptual unit that holds together and forms a unified whole.

===Psychoanalysis===
Fritz Perls trained as a neurologist at major medical institutions and as a Freudian psychoanalyst in Berlin and Vienna, the most important international centers of the discipline in his day. He worked as a training analyst for several years with the official recognition of the International Psychoanalytic Association (IPA), and must be considered an experienced clinician.
Gestalt therapy was influenced by psychoanalysis: it was part of a continuum moving from the early work of Freud, to the later Freudian ego analysis, to Wilhelm Reich and his character analysis and notion of character armor, with attention to nonverbal behavior; this was consonant with Laura Perls&#x27;s background in dance and movement therapy. To this was added the insights of academic Gestalt psychology, including &quot;perception&quot;, &quot;Gestalt formation&quot;, and the tendency of organisms to &quot;complete an incomplete Gestalt&quot; and to form &quot;wholes&quot; in experience.

Central to Fritz and Laura Perls&#x27;s modifications of psychoanalysis was the concept of &quot;dental&quot; or &quot;oral aggression&quot;. In &quot;Ego, Hunger and Aggression&quot; (1947), Fritz Perls&#x27;s first book, to which Laura Perls contributed (ultimately without recognition), Perls suggested that when the infant develops teeth, he or she has the capacity to chew, to break food apart, and, by analogy, to &quot;experience&quot;, &quot;taste&quot;, &quot;accept&quot;, &quot;reject&quot;, or &quot;assimilate&quot;. This was opposed to Freud&#x27;s notion that only introjection takes place in early experience. Thus Perls made assimilation, as opposed to introjection, a focal theme in his work, and the prime means by which growth occurs in therapy.

In contrast to the psychoanalytic stance, in which the &quot;patient&quot; introjects the (presumably more healthy) interpretations of the analyst, in Gestalt therapy the client must &quot;taste&quot; his or her own experience and either accept or reject it—but &quot;not&quot; introject or &quot;swallow whole.&quot; Hence, the emphasis is on avoiding interpretation, and instead encouraging discovery. This is the key point in the divergence of Gestalt therapy from traditional psychoanalysis: growth occurs through gradual assimilation of experience in a natural way, rather than by accepting the interpretations of the analyst; thus, the therapist should not &quot;interpret&quot;, but lead the client to &quot;discover&quot; for him- or herself.

The Gestalt therapist contrives experiments that lead the client to greater awareness and fuller experience of his or her possibilities. Experiments can be focused on undoing projections or retroflections. The therapist can work to help the client with closure of unfinished Gestalts (&quot;unfinished business&quot; such as unexpressed emotions towards somebody in the client&#x27;s life). There are many kinds of experiments that might be therapeutic, but the essence of the work is that it is experiential rather than interpretive, and in this way, Gestalt therapy distinguishes itself from psychoanalysis.

==Therapies influenced by Gestalt therapy==
Psychotherapies influenced by Gestalt therapy include:
* Acceptance and commitment therapy
* Emotion-focused therapy

==Current status==
Gestalt therapy reached a zenith in the United States in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Since then, it has influenced other fields like organizational development, coaching, and teaching. Many of its contributions have become assimilated into other schools of therapy. In recent years, it has seen a resurgence in popularity as an active, psychodynamic form of therapy which has also incorporated some elements of recent developments in attachment theory. There are, for example, four Gestalt training institutes in the New York City metropolitan area alone, in addition to dozens of others worldwide.

Gestalt therapy continues to thrive as a widespread form of psychotherapy, especially throughout Europe, where there are many practitioners and training institutions. Dan Rosenblatt led Gestalt therapy training groups and public workshops at the Tokyo Psychotherapy Academy for seven years. Stewart Kiritz continued in this role from 1997 to 2006.

===Training of Gestalt therapists===
====Pedagogical approach====
Many Gestalt therapy training organizations exist worldwide. Ansel Woldt asserted that Gestalt teaching and training are built upon the belief that people are, by nature, health-seeking. Thus, such commitments as authenticity, optimism, holism, health, and trust become important principles to consider when engaged in the activity of teaching and learning—especially Gestalt therapy theory and practice.

===Associations===
The Association for the Advancement of Gestalt Therapy holds a biennial international conference in various locations—the first was in New Orleans, in 1995. Subsequent conferences have been held in San Francisco, Cleveland, New York, Dallas, St. Pete&#x27;s Beach, Vancouver (British Columbia), Manchester (England), and Philadelphia. In addition, the it holds regional conferences, and its regional network has spawned regional conferences in Amsterdam, the Southwest and the Southeast of the United States, England, and Australia. Its Research Task Force generates and nurtures active research projects and an international conference on research.

The European Association for Gestalt Therapy, founded in 1985 to gather European individual Gestalt therapists, training institutes, and national associations from more than twenty European nations.

Gestalt Australia and New Zealand was formally established at the first Gestalt Therapy Conference held in Perth in September 1998.

===Limitations===
It has been shown that Gestalt therapy is neither designed nor intended for treatment of young adolescents, especially those who manifest severe psychiatric or behavioral disorders.

<text>Events from the year 1922 in France.

==Incumbents==
*President: Alexandre Millerand 
*President of the Council of Ministers: Aristide Briand (until 15 January), Raymond Poincare (starting 15 January)

==Events==

The year 1922 was signalized at its opening by the conference of Cannes, between France, the United Kingdom, and Belgium, which met to consider the situation created by Germany&#x27;s declaration of her inability to pay what was demanded of her for 1922. The chief result of this conference was a decision to hold a general European conference at Genoa, and Aristide Briand, the French premier, signed with the British prime minister, David Lloyd George, a draft pact of guarantee which stated that &quot;guarantees for the security of France against a future invasion by Germany are indispensable to the restoration of stability in Europe, to the security of Great Britain, and the peace of the world.&quot;

At Paris, however, the political atmosphere had become hostile to Briand, who, finding that he had not the support of Parliament, resigned from the premiership at a memorable sitting on 12 January. After a very brief crisis Raymond Poincaré presented himself before Parliament with a new cabinet containing several members of the previous one.

In his ministerial address, Poincaré said bluntly that France would defend her interests as her Allies defended theirs, and he criticized adversely the conferences of the Supreme Council. His tone was aggressive, but at the same time perfectly courteous.

The old cabinet was not allowed to disappear in peace. Briand, its head, was specially marked out for attack. A report of his ineptitude while at Washington was made the most of in order to discredit him. But his unpopularity reached its height when it leaked out that at Cannes Briand, against the advice of the War Ministry, had given instructions for French war material to be handed over to the Kemalists.

The advent to power of Poincaré caused a distinct change in Franco-British relations. Poincaré did not like conferences. He preferred the old diplomatic method by which the heads of governments did not meet until everything had been discussed and put in order by the ambassadors.

In spite, however, of his avowed objections, Poincaré could not avoid the participation of France in the conference of Genoa, which had been fixed for early in March. In a memorandum sent to the British government on 6 February, Poincaré criticized severely the programme laid down at Cannes for the conference of Genoa. This document emphasized two points: first, that the treaties drawn up by the peace conference were not to be modified in any particular; secondly, that the power and the authority of the League of Nations should not be derogated from in any way, and that its place should not be usurped by the conference of Genoa in dealing with any of the questions which came within its competence. About a fortnight after the publication of this memorandum, Lloyd George and Poincaré met at Boulogne (25 February) and agreed that at Genoa no discussion should be admitted either of the Treaty of Versailles and its annexes or of reparations. Briand had already obtained a similar assurance at Cannes.

The conference of Genoa actually opened on 15 April, almost a month and a half after the date originally fixed. Whereas all the other powers were represented by their prime ministers, Poincaré remained in Paris. The French representatives were, however, men of the highest standing - Barthou, Colrat, Barrère, Seydoux, Picard, and experts of the first rank.

France&#x27;s position at the conference was difficult. In regard to Russia she was torn between the desire of defending Europe against the &quot;menace of Bolshevism&quot;, a movement that seemed repugnant to French tradition, and the fear of finding herself left behind in the struggle for concessions in Russia, where she had such important interests. In regard to reparations, again, she found herself in danger of becoming isolated on the question of the enforcement of the Treaty of Versailles. At that time France could not think without anxiety of a rupture which would leave her to assert her rights alone. Her financial situation was bad. Her industry was suffering. The Chamber had adopted the principle of military service for eighteen months, and France was accused of imperialism by those who did not see that it was only the non-execution of the Treaty of Versailles which compelled her to preserve intact her defensive force.

The conference could not agree on the guarantees to be demanded of the Russians, and the memorandum presented to them did not bear the signatures of France and Belgium. France was accused of desiring to checkmate at all costs the agreement, and some bitter words were exchanged. But calm was restored before the conference ended on 19 May. One result of the conference was to show, as Poincaré had foreseen, the irreconcilable opposition between the Soviets and the Western nations. Another result, of particular value to France, was to demonstrate the necessity of Anglo-French agreement, and to cement the alliance still further.

France at Genoa had held her own; she had neither gained nor lost anything. In regard to Russia, she had abandoned none of her claims as a creditor, and in regard to Europe, she remained the champion of the imprescriptible and sacred right of private property. But no solution had been found of the reparations problem. Would such a solution be forthcoming at the Hague conference, which had been decided on as a continuation of Genoa?

The attitude of Germany at the conference of Genoa had been regarded as satisfactory. France had had no need to exercise her right of sanction. Germany seemed willing to accept financial control, and also to impose fresh taxes. It was possible to hope that the conference of bankers which met at Paris in May to study the question of an international loan might really be successful.

The Hague conference commenced in June, and was attended by France, which found itself almost completely in accord with the British government. In order to meet the wishes of France, England consented that the holders of Russian bonds should be invited to participate in the labours of the conference in order to see if they could not come to an understanding directly with the Soviet government. In regard to war debts, the British government repeated that it was willing to annul part of its Russian claim, and this statement obviously opened up the much larger question of all the inter-Allied debts.

The international committee of bankers mentioned above had adjourned (10 June) after laying down as a condition of its assistance that the finances of Germany should be restored and that the uncertainty regarding the extent of reparations should be removed. The representative of France had refused to sign this statement, insisting that no reduction of the figure of reparations could be considered until some arrangement had been made among the Allies by which France herself should be relieved of part of her debt to England and the United States.

In home affairs, Parliament finally passed the eighteen months&#x27; service bill. The commercial difficulties with Spain were settled. The Poincaré ministry, though often assailed, remained unshaken. A new scheme of secondary education was introduced by the minister of education, Léon Bérard. The Poincaré cabinet also made efforts to refloat the Banque Industrielle de Chine. This matter raised storms of controversy in France and was utilized by the political parties as a weapon with which to vilify each other. One result of the affair was the suspension for ten years of Philippe Berthelot, the secretary general of the Foreign Office.

In the middle of May the cantonal elections took place and the results tended to show that there had been a slight movement away from the Right. Some of the anti-government candidates at these elections were supported by the local prefects, and a cry was raised against the political activity of public officials, including secondary school teachers and post office employees who adhered to Communism. The government was blamed for not taking serious steps to remove guilty officials. Whether public clamour was becoming too loud, or whether the government desired to make an example, two Communist deputies, Marcel Cachin and Vaillant Couturier, were tried on 29 July for being concerned in the publication of an article inciting soldiers to disobedience, and were condemned to pay a fine of 500 francs each. Nor was this the only trouble of its kind with which the government had to deal. A prolonged strike of metal workers at Le Havre became so serious that on 26 August the military had to be called out and several casualties ensued. The strike did not end until 9 October, after lasting 110 days, the men returning to work on terms imposed by their employers. The Communists were blamed for the strike. But the Communists had been in bad odour ever since 14 July when, on the occasion of the Fête National, a young Communist attempted to shoot the president of the republic but missed his mark.

The financial situation was a source of very grave anxiety. The deficit amounted to 4 milliards of francs, despite the yield from taxes, direct and indirect, being much larger than in 1921. The public was alarmed to see no solution proposed except to resort to economies which were not always in the best interests of the state, and to impose taxes which might prove insupportable. It was irritated by seeing the sympathy of the world directed rather to Germany and Russia than to its own embarrassments. The decision for which it waited never seemed to arrive.

The Hague conference had had no other result than to confirm the opinion formed at Genoa, of the impossibility of coming to an accord with the Soviets. Whatever the world may think, France had really sought, both at Genoa and The Hague, to bring Russia back into the comity of nations. But the time was not yet ripe.

Meanwhile, the Chamber appeared not to be disposed to ratify the Washington naval agreements. The government did indeed produce a ratification bill, but it was a long time in committee, and had not reached the full house by the end of the year.

Mention should also be made of the scheme for railway development, including the electrification of the French railways, brought forward during the year by Yves Le Trocquer, minister of public works.

France during the year watched with very close concern developments in the Near East. She did not cease to instil into Mustafa Kemal counsels of moderation, while by sending Henry Franklin-Bouillon to Angora she gave confidence to the Turks. After the Turkish victory over the Greeks, France withdrew her troops to guard against the possibility of serious incidents. She then awaited the decision of the conference of Lausanne on the question of peace with Turkey and the freedom of the Straits.

In Syria, France has reduced her troops to an absolute minimum. The civil credits for 1922 amounted to 50 million francs, but they were soon to be reduced very considerably. There was every reason to expect that before long Syria would cost France next to nothing, at any rate in comparison with the financial sacrifices hitherto made.

The colonial policy of France, under the direction of Albert Sarraut, has been highly successful in 1922, both in Madagascar, in Indochina, and elsewhere. During the year Sarraut at his own expense paid a visit to Martinique, to see what improvements could be effected in those regions. But it is in North Africa that the work of France has been particularly noteworthy. While the conference of Genoa was sitting, Alexandre Millerand, president of the republic, made a tour through Morocco, Algiers, and Tunis. Everywhere he was welcomed with great enthusiasm. The theme of all his speeches was that the future of North Africa lay in the closest possible cooperation of the native Arabs and Berbers with the French soldiers, administrators, and colonists. In Tunis, Millerand warned the people against a certain pan-Islamic agitation which has been on foot there for some time, and consulted with Lucien Saint, the resident-general, on suggested reforms in the administration. In Morocco Millerand was struck by the prestige and authority which Marshal Hubert Lyautey had managed to preserve for the person and the office of the sultan, and his success in maintaining a native government which was respected side by side with a protecting power which was obeyed. Millerand said: &quot;France can be proud of its African domain. ... She has not come to enslave. ... The Mohammedan world can have confidence in her, and hand in hand with her aspire to a glorious future.&quot;

The last weeks of 1922 brought into view more clearly than ever the default of Germany in the matter of reparations. In spite of various interviews between ministers and the journey of Poincaré to London, no solution was discovered. On 21 December Poincaré again defined his policy in a speech in the Senate which was unanimously approved of. Repeating his formula: &quot;No moratorium without guarantees&quot;, he reminded the Germans that they still possessed their immovable goods, their coal, their customs, and other sources of wealth and revenue. &quot;We want these goods&quot;, he proceeded, &quot;and others which you have, to serve as guarantees for your unpaid debts, and also as means for bringing pressure to bear on your great manufacturers, I mean those persons who are acquiring great wealth in Germany at the expense of the people itself.&quot; Thus Poincaré drew a clear distinction between the German masses and the privileged few who were exploiting them. What France desired, he went on, was that Germany should free herself as quickly as possible, the payment of reparations by instalments extending over a long period of time being full of grave inconveniences. &quot;It is desirable, therefore, that Germany should clear herself of her debt by successive payments of lump sums, instead of yearly mites, and for this purpose should procure money from abroad.&quot; This did not mean, however, that the regulation of reparations should be put in the hands of bankers; it should remain as hitherto with the governments concerned and the Reparations Commission. With regard to the inter-Allied debts, Poincaré once more stated the French point of view: &quot;A large part of France&#x27;s war expenses is represented by its debt to England and the United States; it cannot be asked to repay these countries before it has itself been indemnified for its losses.&quot; Referring finally to relations between France and England, Poincaré expressed the hope that these would continue to be as cordial as heretofore, even should the two countries find themselves obliged to differ on any point.

<text>Mġarr (), formerly known as &quot;Mgiarro&quot;, is a village in the Northern Region of Malta. Mġarr is a rural village, isolated from nearby towns and cities. Mġarr lies west of Mosta and is surrounded by farmland and vineyards. Many of the 4,840 Imġarrin are farmers or otherwise engaged in agricultural activity.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The Ta&#x27; Skorba Temples are the earliest remains of human occupation in Mġarr, dating back to the Neolithic Għar Dalam phase of Maltese Prehistory. It is believed that they settled in Mġarr because of the fields, hills and water streams. Skorba was excavated in the early 1960s.

The Ta&#x27; Ħaġrat Temples was built in two phases. The minor Saflieni Phase temple can be entered from the major temple, and was built by smaller rocks. The Ġgantija Phase temple consisted of the rest of the temple, including the majestic entrance. These temples were discovered in 1917 and excavated between 1923 and 1926 by Sir Temi Zammit. The site was again excavated in 1954 and in 1961.

=== Punic and Roman Rule ===
Punic Tombs are found scattered around Mġarr, including in Abbatija and near Skorba. These prove that human occupation in Mġarr lasted till around the last century BC. Around 33 Punic Tombs have been found in Mġarr.

The Binġemma Tombs, known as Għerien il-Lhud (English: Jewish Caves) are dug into the Dwejra Hill. These have suffered considerable damage since the cave was used as a dwelling, to house animals and as a war shelter. There are various speculations about what these tombs were for. The Catacombs in Tar-Ragħad show the standing of early Roman Catholics in Malta.

The Roman Villa in Ras ir-Raħeb was apparently used as a site for sacred rites. The Għajn Tuffieħa Roman Baths nearby were erected approximately during the 1st or 2nd century AD. Various rooms including for hot baths, cold baths and relaxation were found. Rooms seem to have been added to be used for recreation.

From the 4th century onwards, there is no concrete proof of what happened in the Mġarr area. During the Arab period, it can only be assumed that small settlements might have persisted in areas like tan-Nadur, ta&#x27; Binġemma and tas-Santi, since they were concealed by the hills.

=== Norman and Hospitaller Rule ===
Once the Normans conquered Malta and gradually gained full control of it, commerce in the Fomm ir-Riħ, Ġnejna, and Għajn Tuffieħa ports rose. Cotton, cumin and vineyards were also grown to generate income. Ever since 1419, watchmen were assigned to ensure that products were not stolen or looted. Parts of Binġemma and Santi during these times were sold as feudal lands.

Mġarr also played a role in the Great Siege of Malta. The Ottoman invading army, led by Mustafa Pasha anchored their ships in Mġarr. Men from Mġarr also formed part of the Naxxar Dejma Company. 
==Churches==
=== Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Parish Church===

One of the earliest mentions of the chapel predating the Parish Church that is standing today was in the Rollo of 1436. The Church used to fall under various parishes, including Mdina, Naxxar and Mellieħa. It is understood that the chapel had been standing since the 1400s, and had major renovations in the 1600s to avoid it collapsing. However in 1918 the chapel was demolished and the Parish Church still standing today was built in its place.

Mġarr and its surrounding zones became an autonomus Parish in 1898, when the population was around 581 and was rising steadily. This led to the Parish Priest and the parishioners wishing to erect a larger church than the one currently present. Work on the new Parish Church started in 1905. Its construction depended heavily on voluntary work and the generous contributions obtained by parishioners from the sale of agricultural products. Despite efforts to speed up the work, the church was not completed until 1946. The Church was completely finished and consecrated in 1948, due to interruptions because of the Second World War, amongst others.

The church is situated on elevated ground, offering a panoramic view of the surrounding fields and hills. Numerous houses still encompass the narrow streets surrounding the church, keeping the traditional feel of the church being the most imposing building of the town centre. This can especially be seen from the Binġemma area, where the church can be easily seen as the largest building in central Mġarr.

==Education==
===Saint Nicholas College, Mġarr Primary School===
The Mġarr Primary School was opened on 19 September 1923. Prior to its opening, only 1% of the population were literate in English and/or Italian, and only 4% were literate in Maltese. Fr Edgar Salomone worked hard and managed to influence the members of the newly elected Self Government in favour of the primary school. In 1946, Mġarr had the highest rate of school attendance nationally.

Eventually, the school expanded and built new classes to accommodate the growth in the student population. It also joined the Saint Nicholas College network of schools.

===San Andrea School===

San Andrea School is a private school located in Mġarr. The school was founded in 1992 in Naxxar. It was founded by the Parents Foundation of Education, who also founded San Anton School.

===San Anton School===

San Anton School is a private school located in Mġarr. The school was founded in 1988 in the village of Attard, close to the President&#x27;s San Anton Palace, giving the school its name.

==Local Groups==
===Mġarr United Football Club===

Mġarr United F.C. was founded in 1967 after the disillusion of Mġarr Eagles F.C. The Club has had its fair share of successes, and is active in both training its club members and playing matches.

===Soċjetà Filarmonika Marija Mtellgħa s-Sema&#x27; L-Imġarr ===
The Santa Marija Mtellgħa s-Sema&#x27; Philharmonic Society was founded in October 2011. Preparations for the foundation of the band started before the 2011 Festa.

Apart from the Village Festa, the band also played during the possession ceremony of Mons Kalċidon Vassallo and Fr George Schembri as parish priest. The band also played in various local feasts outside of Imġarr. The band was also invited by the Italian Comune of Mathi in 2018, as the band&#x27;s first service abroad.

===Soċjetà Spettaklu Marija Assunta Mġarr===
The Society is responsible for the fireworks and spectacle events during the Village Festa and other events of local importance.

<text>Richard Leslie Vranch (born 29 June 1959) is an English actor, improviser, comedian, writer and musician. He is known for providing the music for the British TV series &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;

==Early life==
Vranch&#x27;s parents were a teacher and a BT engineer. He attended Bristol Grammar School and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, graduating from Cambridge University with a BA and PhD in physics. While a first-year doctoral student, he joined the Footlights in 1981 and was a contemporary of Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Morwenna Banks, Tony Slattery and Neil Mullarkey. He was also a member of the Light Entertainment Society and the Cambridge University Mummers.

He was a researcher at the Cavendish Laboratory and a research fellow at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford for nine months before going into comedy full-time.

==Career==
===Stand-up comedy and improvisation===
Vranch has performed since 1979. He formed a comedy double-act with Tony Slattery in 1981. The duo hosted the Channel 4 quiz &quot;The Music Game&quot; and over 100 episodes of &quot;Cue The Music&quot; on ITV. He was the improvising pianist and guitarist on the original British television show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; from 1988. 

He co-wrote and performed in &quot;The Paul Merton Show&quot; at the London Palladium in 1994. With Pippa the Ripper he is half of the hula-hoop/science double act Dr Hula. In 2006, he appeared at the Ars Nova theatre, New York and co-founded the improv storytelling group &quot;The YarnBards&quot;. In 2012, with others he co-wrote and appeared in the UK tour and West End run of the stage show Paul Merton &quot;Out of My Head&quot;.

Since at least 1988 Vranch has appeared at London&#x27;s The Comedy Store. He currently appears there every week with the Comedy Store Players.

===Voice artist===
Vranch has voiced TV and radio commercials for companies including British Airways, Lidl and Saab. He also narrates TV documentaries, including the first series of &quot;The Hotel Inspector&quot;.

===Acting===
Acting work includes &quot;Dogman&quot;, &quot;The Dead Set&quot;, &quot;Hello Mum&quot; (1986) and sketch shows. He appeared as Gilmanuk in the audio &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Theatre of War&quot; (Big Finish Productions).

===Writing===
He has written for stage, radio and TV, and made several animated films with artist Lucy Allen. They have had their cartoons published in &quot;Maxim&quot;, &quot;Punch&quot; and &quot;The Spectator&quot;. In 2002 he was commissioned by Tamasha Theatre Company (East is East) as a writer for their show &quot;Ryman and the Sheik&quot; and worked for a few years as an Artistic Associate of the company.

===Television and radio===
Vranch presented the children&#x27;s shows &quot;Let&#x27;s Pretend&quot; on ITV and &quot;Jackanory&quot; on BBC One. He hosted his own science series, &quot;Beat That Einstein&quot;, on Channel 4 in 1994. He was a guest on &quot;You Bet!&quot; in 1995 and appeared on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s long-running panel game &quot;Just a Minute&quot; in 1999 and in 2005 was a contestant on a charity special of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;. He has appeared on the panel shows &quot;Puzzle Panel&quot; and &quot;The Infinite Monkey Cage&quot; on Radio 4 and &quot;Mind Games&quot; on BBC TV. He discussed the switch-on of the Large Hadron Collider in September 2008 with Jeremy Vine and Simon Singh on BBC Radio 2.

In the early 2000s he presented a radio show &quot;Jammin&quot; with Rowland Rivron on BBC Radio 2.

<text>This is a list of the joint premiers of the Province of Canada, who were the heads of government of the Province of Canada from the 1841 unification of Upper Canada and Lower Canada until Confederation in 1867.

Each administration was led by two men; after Sydenham&#x27;s Ministry, one from Canada West (now Ontario) and one from Canada East (now Quebec). Officially, one of them at any given time had the title of &quot;Premier&quot;, while the other had the title of &quot;Deputy&quot;.

==Colour key==
* Green – reformers (Reform Party, Rouges Party, etc.)

<doc id="470314" wikidata="Q16254383" url="?curid=470314" title="Instantaneously trained neural networks">
<text>Instantaneously trained neural networks are feedforward artificial neural networks that create a new hidden neuron node for each novel training sample. The weights to this hidden neuron separate out not only this training sample but others that are near it, thus providing generalization. This separation is done using the nearest hyperplane that can be written down instantaneously. In the two most important implementations the neighborhood of generalization either varies with the training sample (CC1 network) or remains constant (CC4 network). These networks use unary coding for an effective representation of the data sets.

This type of network was first proposed in a 1993 paper of Subhash Kak. Since then, instantaneously trained neural networks have been proposed as models of short term learning and used in web search, and financial time series prediction applications. They have also been used in instant classification of documents and for deep learning and data mining.

As in other neural networks, their normal use is as software, but they have also been implemented in hardware using FPGAs and by optical implementation.

==CC4 network==
In the CC4 network, which is a three-stage network, the number of input nodes is one more than the size of the training vector, with the extra node serving as the biasing node whose input is always 1. For binary input vectors, the weights from the input nodes to the hidden neuron (say of index j) corresponding to the trained vector is given by the following formula:
:formula_1

where formula_2 is the radius of generalization and formula_3 is the Hamming weight (the number of 1s) of the binary sequence. From the hidden layer to the output layer the weights are 1 or -1 depending on whether the vector belongs to a given output class or not. The neurons in the hidden and output layers output 1 if the weighted sum to the input is 0 or positive and 0, if the weighted sum to the input is negative:

:formula_4

==Other networks==
The CC4 network has also been modified to include non-binary input with varying radii of generalization so that it effectively provides a CC1 implementation.

In feedback networks the Willshaw network as well as the Hopfield network are able to learn instantaneously.

<text>was a village located in Iwafune District, Niigata Prefecture, Japan. The village was named after the Asahi Mountains.

As of 2005, the village had an estimated population of 11,836 and a density of 18.69 persons per km2. The total area was 629.32 km2.

On April 1, 2008, Asahi, along with the towns of Arakawa and Sanpoku, and the village of Kamihayashi (all from Iwafune District), was merged into the expanded city of Murakami.

The village was established in 1896 by merging Tatekoshi (館腰村), Miomote (三面村), Takane (高根村), Shionomachi (塩野町村), and Sarusawa (猿沢村) villages.

Asahi had a sister relationship with Kiyose, Tokyo.

<text>Iron(II) oxide or ferrous oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula FeO. Its mineral form is known as wüstite. One of several iron oxides, it is a black-colored powder that is sometimes confused with rust, the latter of which consists of hydrated iron(III) oxide (ferric oxide). Iron(II) oxide also refers to a family of related non-stoichiometric compounds, which are typically iron deficient with compositions ranging from Fe0.84O to Fe0.95O.

==Preparation==
FeO can be prepared by the thermal decomposition of iron(II) oxalate. 
:FeC2O4 → FeO + CO2 + CO
The procedure is conducted under an inert atmosphere to avoid the formation of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3). A similar procedure can also be used for the synthesis of manganous oxide and stannous oxide.

Stoichiometric FeO can be prepared by heating Fe0.95O with metallic iron at 770 °C and 36 kbar.

==Reactions==
FeO is thermodynamically unstable below 575 °C, tending to disproportionate to metal and Fe3O4:
:* 4FeO → Fe + Fe3O4

==Structure==
Iron(II) oxide adopts the cubic, rock salt structure, where iron atoms are octahedrally coordinated by oxygen atoms and the oxygen atoms octahedrally coordinated by iron atoms. The non-stoichiometry occurs because of the ease of oxidation of FeII to FeIII effectively replacing a small portion of FeII with two-thirds their number of FeIII, which take up tetrahedral positions in the close packed oxide lattice.

In contrast to the crystalline solid, in the molten state iron atoms are coordinated by predominantly 4 or 5 oxygen atoms.

Below 200 K there is a minor change to the structure which changes the symmetry to rhombohedral and samples become antiferromagnetic.

==Occurrence in nature==
Iron(II) oxide makes up approximately 9% of the Earth&#x27;s mantle. Within the mantle, it may be electrically conductive, which is a possible explanation for perturbations in Earth&#x27;s rotation not accounted for by accepted models of the mantle&#x27;s properties.

==Uses==
Iron(II) oxide is used as a pigment. It is FDA-approved for use in cosmetics and it is used in some tattoo inks. It can also be used as a phosphate remover from home aquaria.

<text>Aklavik (Inuvialuktun: &quot;Akłarvik&quot;) (from the Inuvialuktun meaning &quot;barrenground grizzly place&quot;) is a hamlet located in the Inuvik Region of the Northwest Territories, Canada. Until 1961, with a population over 1,500, the community served as the regional administrative centre for the territorial government.

Because of repeated flooding in this area, the government developed Inuvik to the east. It was meant to entirely replace Aklavik, but many of the residents of the original community persevered and kept Aklavik going. Its 2018 population was 623. The hamlet&#x27;s mayor is Andrew Charlie.

==History==

Aklavik began to develop in the early 1900s after the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company opened a trading post in 1912. The Roman Catholic Church later established a mission here in 1926. Located on the Peel Channel, the community became a transportation hub in the Mackenzie. It was in a good trapping area.

Aklavik became part of the Northwest Territories and Yukon Radio System (NWT&amp;Y) in October 1925. The NWT&amp;Y system, a pioneer system, was critical in providing communications in Canada&#x27;s North. It was operated by the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals (RC Sigs). In Aklavik, besides providing services to the general population, NWT&amp;Y also provided communication for any aircraft that overflew the site, with or without radio. An aircraft without radio that was passing over one of these stations and not planning to land, would fly very low over the station so that it could be identified and the date and time of its passing could be recorded. The call sign for the NWT&amp;Y station in Aklavik was VEF.

In 1931, Albert Johnson, also known as the &quot;Mad Trapper of Rat River&quot;, moved into the area. A complaint was made to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) post in Aklavik and the two members attempted, unsuccessfully, to talk with him concerning trapline tampering. A few days later, after gaining a search warrant, they tried again to talk with him, but Johnson fatally shot one of the RCMP and fled. A 42-day manhunt began, ending with Johnson&#x27;s death. These events are considered to have been the catalyst for introducing the airplane and communications radio as tools to help track a person. Museums dedicated to Albert Johnson can be found in Aklavik and in Fort Smith.

In December 1946, radio station &quot;CHAK&quot; went on the air at Aklavik. The AK in the call sign was the first and last letters of the location. Built and initially operated by WO2 R.A. (Red) McLeod of the RC Sigs, the station was a voluntary operation serving the Mackenzie River delta. It initially had 30 watts of power, later upgraded to 100 watts, and operated on 1490 kHz. It received its license in 1947.

In 1949, the Royal Canadian Navy established a signals intelligence station in Aklavik. It remained operational until March 1961. After it closed down, operations were moved to a newly built station in Inuvik.

By the 1950s the community had developed to more than 1,600 people. However, the Peel Channel was subject to flooding, and the river banks were being washed away. Due to the flooding, the Federal Government built a new community at what is now Inuvik, and intended to close Aklavik.

In the 1960s, the principal of Aklavik&#x27;s school, A. J. (Moose) Kerr, started a committee to help save the community. The efforts were successful and the community has survived. The local school is named for him.

==Today==

The community has a school with approximately 150 students from Kindergarten to Grade 12 (K-12). Aurora College provides adult education at the Community Learning Centre.

There are three general stores: the Aklavik General Store, Stantons, and the Northern Store operated by The North West Company. The community has a three-person RCMP detachment, a health centre with four nurses, a Canada Post outlet, the Aklavik Lodge and the Aklavik Inn (Bessie&#x27;s Boarding House) for visitor accommodation, and two taxi companies.

Like most northern communities, Aklavik has a community hall, and a gymnasium that is attached to the school. Uncommonly it also has a swimming pool.

The community is served only by air, via the Aklavik/Freddie Carmichael Airport, and by winter ice road directly from Inuvik across the streams of the Mackenzie Delta. When the river is open, usually June to September, the Aklavik Water Aerodrome is available for float planes.

==Land claims==

Aklavik is one of the few places in the NWT to be included within two different land claims areas, being part of the Inuvialuit Settlement Region and the Gwich&#x27;in Settlement Region.

The Inuvialuit, whose claim, the &quot;Inuvialuit Final Agreement&quot; was settled in 1984, are represented by the Aklavik Community Corporation. It forms part of the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation.

The Gwich&#x27;in of Aklavik are covered under the &quot;Gwich&#x27;in Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement&quot;, signed in 1992, and are represented by the Ehdiitat Gwich&#x27;in Council, as well as the Aklavik First Nation. The Ehdiitat Gwich&#x27;in Council in turn forms part of the Gwich&#x27;in Tribal Council.

==Indigenous peoples==
The Inuvialuit of Aklavik, an Inuit, are primarily Uummarmiut. They are descendants of the Nunamiut, Inupiat people who migrated from Alaska in the early 20th century. Although at first antagonistic with the local Siglit, the peoples later intermarried. The Siglit suffered high mortality from new infectious diseases. They speak Uummarmiutun, which is almost identical to Inupiaq language, but is grouped with Inuvialuktun.

The Gwich&#x27;in, a First Nations people, are an Arctic-dwelling Dene people who inhabit parts of Alaska, and Yukon and the NWT in Canada. They speak the Gwichʼin language, which is part of the Athabaskan language family.

Both Inuvialuktun and Gwichʼin are official languages of the NWT, and in 2009 19.2% of the Aboriginal population spoke at least one Native language.

== Climate ==
Aklavik has a subarctic climate (Dfc), typical of Canada&#x27;s Arctic, with mild summers and cold winters lasting most of the year with highs regularly below zero. Freezing can occur at any time of the year.

==Demographics==


In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Aklavik had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

Like most other NWT communities the majority of the population, 93.2%, is Indigenous. However, unlike other communities Aklavik has a large number of both First Nations, 33.9%, and Inuit, 53.4%, along with a small number of Métis, 4.2%, and non-Aboriginal, 8.5%.

From 2006 to 2014 there were 94 births and 42 deaths in the community. In 2017, 14% of residents were 9 or under, 6.9% were from 10 to 14 years old, 14.2% were from 15 to 24, 30.9% were from 25 to 44, 20% were from 45 to 59, and 14% were 60 or older. At the 2016 census the median age in Aklavik was 31.8, compared to 34.0 for the NWT and 41.2 for Canada as a whole.

The crime rate for 2016 was 70.9 (per 1,000 persons) for violent crimes, and 200.9 (per 1,000 persons) for property crimes, both numbers below the average for the NWT of 78.4 and 206.6. In 2015 the average income in the hamlet was C$33,826, compared to $61,909 for the NWT, and the average income for a family was $80,200, compared to $133,754 for the NWT, with 20.0% of all families earning less than $30,000.

<text>In mathematics, specifically in calculus and complex analysis, the logarithmic derivative of a function &quot;f&quot; is defined by the formula
formula_1
where formula_2 is the derivative of &quot;f&quot;. Intuitively, this is the infinitesimal relative change in &quot;f&quot;; that is, the infinitesimal absolute change in &quot;f,&quot; namely formula_3 scaled by the current value of &quot;f.&quot;

When &quot;f&quot; is a function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) of a real variable &quot;x&quot;, and takes real, strictly positive values, this is equal to the derivative of ln(&quot;f&quot;), or the natural logarithm of &quot;f&quot;. This follows directly from the chain rule:
formula_4

==Basic properties==
Many properties of the real logarithm also apply to the logarithmic derivative, even when the function does &quot;not&quot; take values in the positive reals. For example, since the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the factors, we have
formula_5
So for positive-real-valued functions, the logarithmic derivative of a product is the sum of the logarithmic derivatives of the factors. But we can also use the Leibniz law for the derivative of a product to get
formula_6
Thus, it is true for &quot;any&quot; function that the logarithmic derivative of a product is the sum of the logarithmic derivatives of the factors (when they are defined).

A corollary to this is that the logarithmic derivative of the reciprocal of a function is the negation of the logarithmic derivative of the function:
formula_7
just as the logarithm of the reciprocal of a positive real number is the negation of the logarithm of the number.

More generally, the logarithmic derivative of a quotient is the difference of the logarithmic derivatives of the dividend and the divisor:
formula_8
just as the logarithm of a quotient is the difference of the logarithms of the dividend and the divisor.

Generalising in another direction, the logarithmic derivative of a power (with constant real exponent) is the product of the exponent and the logarithmic derivative of the base:
formula_9
just as the logarithm of a power is the product of the exponent and the logarithm of the base.

In summary, both derivatives and logarithms have a product rule, a reciprocal rule, a quotient rule, and a power rule (compare the list of logarithmic identities); each pair of rules is related through the logarithmic derivative.

==Computing ordinary derivatives using logarithmic derivatives==

Logarithmic derivatives can simplify the computation of derivatives requiring the product rule while producing the same result. The procedure is as follows: Suppose that and that we wish to compute formula_10. Instead of computing it directly as , we compute its logarithmic derivative. That is, we compute:
formula_11

Multiplying through by ƒ computes :
formula_12

This technique is most useful when ƒ is a product of a large number of factors. This technique makes it possible to compute by computing the logarithmic derivative of each factor, summing, and multiplying by .

For example, we can compute the logarithmic derivative of formula_13 to be formula_14.

==Integrating factors==
The logarithmic derivative idea is closely connected to the integrating factor method for first-order differential equations. In operator terms, write formula_15 and let &quot;M&quot; denote the operator of multiplication by some given function &quot;G&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). Then formula_16 can be written (by the product rule) as formula_17 where formula_18 now denotes the multiplication operator by the logarithmic derivative formula_19

In practice we are given an operator such as
formula_20
and wish to solve equations
formula_21
for the function &quot;h&quot;, given &quot;f&quot;. This then reduces to solving
formula_22
which has as solution
formula_23
with any indefinite integral of &quot;F&quot;.

==Complex analysis==

The formula as given can be applied more widely; for example if &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is a meromorphic function, it makes sense at all complex values of &quot;z&quot; at which &quot;f&quot; has neither a zero nor a pole. Further, at a zero or a pole the logarithmic derivative behaves in a way that is easily analysed in terms of the particular case

with &quot;n&quot; an integer, . The logarithmic derivative is then
formula_24
and one can draw the general conclusion that for &quot;f&quot; meromorphic, the singularities of the logarithmic derivative of &quot;f&quot; are all &quot;simple&quot; poles, with residue &quot;n&quot; from a zero of order &quot;n&quot;, residue −&quot;n&quot; from a pole of order &quot;n&quot;. See argument principle. This information is often exploited in contour integration.

In the field of Nevanlinna theory, an important lemma states that the proximity function of a logarithmic derivative is small with respect to the Nevanlinna characteristic of the original function, for instance formula_25.

==The multiplicative group==
Behind the use of the logarithmic derivative lie two basic facts about &quot;GL&quot;1, that is, the multiplicative group of real numbers or other field. The differential operator
formula_26
is invariant under dilation (replacing &quot;X&quot; by &quot;aX&quot; for &quot;a&quot; constant). And the differential form formula_27 is likewise invariant. For functions &quot;F&quot; into GL1, the formula
formula_28 is therefore a &quot;pullback&quot; of the invariant form.

==Examples==
* Exponential growth and exponential decay are processes with constant logarithmic derivative.
* In mathematical finance, the Greek &quot;λ&quot; is the logarithmic derivative of derivative price with respect to underlying price.
* In numerical analysis, the condition number is the infinitesimal relative change in the output for a relative change in the input, and is thus a ratio of logarithmic derivatives.

<text>Deccani (, &quot;dakhanī&quot; or , &quot;dakanī&quot;; also known as Deccani Urdu, Deccani Hindi, and Deccani Hindustani) is an Indo-Aryan language based on a form of Hindustani spoken in the Deccan region of south-central India and is the native language of the Deccani people. The historical form of Deccani sparked the development of Urdu literature during the late-Mughal period. Deccani arose as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; under the Delhi and Bahmani Sultanates, as trade and migration from the north introduced Hindustani to the Deccan. It later developed a literary tradition under the patronage of the Deccan Sultanates. Deccani itself came to influence modern standard Urdu and later Hindi.

The Deccani language has an Indo-Aryan core vocabulary, though it incoporated loanwards from Persian, which was the official language of the Deccan Sultanates. Additionally, Deccani differs from northern Hindustani sociolects due to archaisms retained from the medieval era, as well as a convergence with and loanwords from the Deccan&#x27;s regional languages like Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Marathi spoken in the states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and some parts of Maharashtra. Deccani has been increasingly influenced by Standard Urdu, especially noticed in Hyderabadi Urdu, which serves as its formal register. In the modern era, it has mostly survived as a spoken lect and is not a literary language. 

There are three primary dialects of Deccani spoken today: Hyderabadi Urdu, Mysore Urdu, and Madrasi Urdu. Hyderabadi Urdu is the closest of these dialects to Standard Urdu and the most spoken.

The term &quot;Deccani&quot; and its variants are often used in two different contexts: a historical, obsolete one, referring to the medieval-era literary predecessor of Hindi-Urdu; and an oral one, referring to the Urdu dialects spoken in many areas of the Deccan today. Both contexts have intricate historical ties.

==History==

=== Origin ===
As a predecessor of modern Hindustani, Deccani has its origins in the contact dialect spoken around Delhi then known as &quot;Dehlavi&quot; and now called Old Hindi&quot;.&quot; In the early 14th century, this dialect was introduced in the Deccan region through the military exploits of Alauddin Khalji. In 1327 AD, Muhammad bin Tughluq shifted his Sultanate&#x27;s capital from Delhi to Daulatabad (near present-day Aurangabad, Maharashtra), causing a mass migration; governors, soldiers and common people moved south, bringing the dialect with them. At this time (and for the next few centuries) the cultural centres of the northern Indian subcontinent were under Persian linguistic hegemony.

The Bahmani Sultanate was formed in 1347 AD with Daulatabad as its capital. This was later moved to Gulbarga and once again, in 1430, to Bidar. By this time, the dialect had acquired the name &quot;Dakhni,&quot; from the name of the region itself, and had become a &quot;lingua franca&quot; for the linguistically diverse people of the region, primarily where the Muslims had settled permanently. The Bahmanids greatly promoted Persian, and did not show any notable patronage for Deccani. However, their 150-year rule saw the burgeoning of a local Deccani literary culture outside the court, as religious texts were made in the language. The Sufis in the region (such as Shah Miranji) were an important vehicle of Deccani; they used it in their preachings since regional languages were more accessible (than Persian) to the general population. This era also saw production of the &quot;masnavi&quot; &quot;Kadam Rao Padam Rao&quot; by Fakhruddin Nizami in the region around Bidar. It is the earliest available manuscript of the Hindavi/Dehlavi/Deccani language, and contains loanwords from local languages such as Telugu and Marathi. Digby suggests that it was not produced in courtly settings.

=== Growth ===

In the early 16th century, the Bahmani Sultanate splintered into the Deccan Sultanates. These were also Persianate in culture, but were characterised by an affinity towards regional languages. They are largely responsible for the development of the Deccani literary tradition, which became concentrated at Golconda and Bijapur. Numerous Deccani poets were patronised in this time. According to Shaheen and Shahid, Golconda was the literary home of Asadullah Wajhi (author of &quot;Sab Ras&quot;), ibn-e-Nishati (&quot;Phulban&quot;), and Ghwasi (&quot;Tutinama&quot;)&quot;.&quot; Bijapur played host to Hashmi Bijapuri, San‘ati, and Mohammed Nusrati over the years.

The rulers themselves participated in these cultural developments. Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah of the Golconda Sultanate wrote poetry in Deccani, which was compiled into a &quot;kulliyyāt.&quot; It is widely considered to be the earliest Urdu poetry of a secular nature. Ibrahim Adil Shah II of the Bijapur Sultanate produced &quot;Kitab-e-Navras&quot; (Book of the Nine Rasas), a work of musical poetry written entirely in Deccani. The &quot;mathnawi&quot; &quot;Pem Nem&quot; was also compiled during his reign.

Although the poets of this era were well-versed in Persian, they were characterised by a preference for indigenous cultures, and a drive to stay independent of esoteric language. As a result, the language they cultivated emphasised the Sanskritic roots of Deccani without overshadowing it, and borrowed from neighbouring languages (especially Marathi; Matthews states that Dravidian influence was much less). In this regard, Shaheen and Shahid note that literary Deccani has historically been very close to spoken Deccani, unlike the northern tradition that has always exhibited diglossia. Poet San&#x27;ati is a particular example of such conscious efforts to retain simplicity:
As the language of court and culture, Persian nevertheless served as the model for poetic forms, and a good amount of Persian and Arabic vocabulary was present in the works of these writers. Hence Deccani attempted to strike a balance between Indian and Persian influences, though it did always retain mutual intelligibility with the northern Dehlavi. This contributed to the cultivation of a distinct Deccani identity, separate from the rulers from the north; many poets proudly extolled the Deccan region and its culture.

Hence, Deccani experienced cultivation into a literary language under the Sultanates, alongside its usage as a common vernacular. It also continued to be used by saints and Sufis for preaching. However, the Sultanates did not use Deccani for official purposes, preferring the prestige language Persian as well as regional languages like Marathi, Kannada, and Telugu.

=== Decline ===
The Mughal conquest of the Deccan by Aurangzeb in the 17th century connected the southern regions of the subcontinent to the north, and introduced a hegemony of northern tastes. This began the decline of Deccani poetry, as literary patronage in the region decreased. The sociopolitical context of the period is reflected in Hashmi Bijapuri&#x27;s poem, composed two years after the fall of Bijapur, in a time when many southern poets were pressured to change their language and style for patronage:
The literary centres of the Deccan had been replaced by the capital of the Mughals, so poets migrated to Delhi for better opportunities. A notable example is that of Wali Deccani (1667–1707), who adapted his Deccani sensibilities to the northern style and produced a &quot;divan&quot; in this variety. His work inspired the Persianate poets of the north to compose in the local dialect, which in their hands became an intermediate predecessor of Hindustani known as Rekhta. This accelerated the downfall of Deccani literature, as Rekhta came to dominate the competing dialects of Mughal Hindustan. The advent of the Asaf Jahis slowed this down, but despite their patronage of regional culture, Deccani Urdu&#x27;s literary tradition died. However, the spoken variety has lived on in the Deccani Muslims, retaining some of its historical features and continuing to be influenced by the neighbouring Dravidian languages.

* The of Urdu is merged with .

=== Vowels ===
* can have lax allophones of when preceding consonants in medial position.
* Diphthong sounds include .
* can be heard as after .
* can be heard as in initial positions.

==Modern era==
The term Deccani today is given to a Hindustani lect spoken natively by many Muslims from Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra (who are known as the Deccanis). It is considered to be the modern, spoken variety of the &quot;historical&quot; Deccani dialect, and inherits many features from it. The term Deccani distinguishes the lect from standard Urdu - however, it is commonly considered a &quot;variety&quot; of Urdu, and often gets subsumed under this name, both by its own speakers and the official administration. The demise of the literary tradition has meant that Deccani uses standard Urdu as its formal register (i.e. for writing, news, education etc).

=== Geographical distribution ===
Deccani speakers centre around Hyderabad, the capital of Telangana. Deccani is also spoken in many other urban areas of the Deccan region and Mumbai, especially those with large Muslim populations such as Aurangabad, Nanded, Akola, Amravati, Bijapur, Gulbarga, Mysore and Bangalore. In addition to members of the Deccani community, some Hindu Rajputs and Marathas in the Deccan speak Deccani Urdu as well.

=== Features ===
Deccani retains some features of medieval Hindustani that have disappeared in contemporary Hindi-Urdu. It is also distinguished by grammar and vocabulary influences from Marathi, Kannada, and Telugu, due to its prolonged use as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; in the Deccan. Below is a non-exhaustive list of its unique features, with standard Urdu equivalents:
These features are used to different degrees among speakers, as there tends to be regional variation. Mustafa names some varieties of Deccani as &quot;Telugu Dakkhni, Kannada Dakkhni, and Tamil Dakkhni&quot;, based on their influence from the dominant Dravidian language in the spoken region. He further divides Telugu Deccani into two linguistic categories, corresponding to Andhra Pradesh, which he says has more Telugu influence; and Telangana, with more influence from standard Urdu. The latter is seen especially in Hyderabad.

Deccani&#x27;s use of Urdu as a standard register, and contact with Hindustani (widespread in India), has led to some of its distinctive features disappearing.

=== Culture ===
Deccani finds a cultural core in and around Hyderabad, where the highest concentration of speakers are; Telangana is one of the only four states of India to provide &quot;Urdu&quot; official status. Deccani Urdu in Hyderabad has found a vehicle of expression through humour and wit, which manifests in events called &quot;Mazahiya Mushaira&quot;, poetic symposiums with comedic themes. An example of Deccani, spoken in such a context at Hyderabad:

Additionally, the Deccani film industry (also called Dollywood) is based in Hyderabad and produces movies in Deccani, especially the Hyderabadi dialect.

== Legacy ==
===Hindustani===
Deccani is often considered a predecessor of Hindustani. The Deccani literary tradition is largely responsible for the development of modern Hindustani since contact with southern poets led to a shift in northern tastes and the development of Urdu as a literary language. Deccani also imparted the practice of writing the local vernacular in the Perso-Arabic script, which eventually became the standard practice for Urdu all over the Indian subcontinent.

<text>The Goethe-Institut (; GI, &quot;Goethe Institute&quot;) is a nonprofit German cultural organization operational worldwide with more than 150 cultural centres, promoting the study of the German language abroad and encouraging international cultural exchange and relations. Around 246,000 people have studied German in these courses per year. It is named after German poet and statesman Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. As a registered association, the Goethe-Institut e.V. is politically independent.

The Goethe-Institut fosters knowledge about Germany by providing information on German culture, society and socio-political affairs. This includes the promotion of German films, music, theatre, and literature. Goethe cultural societies, reading rooms, and examination and language centres have played an important role in the cultural and educational activities of Germany in many countries for more than 60 years.

Partners of the institute and its centres are public and private cultural institutions, the German federal states, local authorities and civil society. Much of the Goethe-Institut&#x27;s overall budget consists of annual grants from the German Foreign Office and the German Press Office. The relationship with the Foreign Office is governed by a general agreement. Further, self-generated income and contributions from sponsors and patrons, partners and friends support the work of the Goethe-Institut.

==History==
*1951: The government of the German Federal republic replaced the former Deutsche Akademie with the new Goethe-Institut.
*1952: The first Goethe-Institut opened in Athens.
*1953: The first language courses run by the Goethe-Institut began in Bad Reichenhall. Due to growing demand, new centres of learning were opened in Murnau and Kochel, the focus of selection being on towns which were small and idyllic and which showed post-war Germany at its best. Lessons were taught based on the first textbook developed by the Goethe-Institut, known by its authors&#x27; names &quot;Schulz-Griesbach&quot;.
*1953–55: The first foreign lectureships of what was the German Academy were taken over by the Goethe-Institut. Responsibilities included German tuition, teacher training and providing a programme of cultural events to accompany courses.
*1959–60: On the initiative of the head of the arts sector of the Foreign Office, Dieter Sattler, the Goethe-Institut gradually took over all existing German cultural institutes abroad.
*1968: Influenced by the student revolts of the late 1960s the Goethe-Institut readjusted its programme of cultural events to include socio-political topics and avant-garde art.
*1970: Acting on behalf of the Foreign Office, German politician Ralf Dahrendorf developed his &quot;guiding principles for foreign cultural policy&quot;. Cultural work involving dialogue and partnership was declared &quot;the third pillar of German foreign policy&quot;. During the Willy Brandt era, the concept of &quot;extended culture&quot; formed the basis of activities at the Goethe-Institut.
*1976: The Foreign Office and the Goethe-Institut signed a general agreement governing the status of the Goethe-Institut, henceforth an independent cultural organisation.
*1980: A new plan regarding the location of institutes within Germany was drawn up. Course venues in small towns, mostly in Bavaria, were replaced by institutes in cities and university towns.
*1989/90: The fall of the Berlin Wall marked a turning point for the Goethe-Institut. Its activities in the 1990s were centered on Eastern Europe, where numerous new institutes were set up.
*2001: The Goethe-Institut merged with the cultural organization Inter Nationes.
*2004: The Goethe-Institut established the first Western information centre in Pyongyang, North Korea, operational until 2009. The Goethe-Institut Inter Nationes also reverted to its original and official name, Goethe-Institut (GI).
*2005: The Goethe-Institut was honoured with the Prince of Asturias Prize of Spain.
*2010: Italian cartoonist Bruno Bozzetto created the new cartoon film &quot;Va Bene&quot; for the institute 
*2014: A Goethe-Institut opened in Myanmar&#x27;s capital Yangon.

==Organization==
The Goethe-Institut is mainly financed by the federal government of Germany, and has around 1,000 employees and an overall budget of approximately 366 million euros, more than half of which is generated from tuition and examination fees. The institute offers training courses and scholarships, including tuition waivers, to students from foreign countries, who are or want to become teachers of German as a foreign language. 

==Locations by country==

==Distance education==
The Goethe-Institut offers courses in distance education. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, when most governments imposed stay-at-home orders and/or COVID-19 lockdowns, Goethe-Institut introduced a series of &quot;blended learning&quot; courses.

==Examinations==
The institute has developed a series of exams for learners of German as a foreign language (&quot;Deutsch als Fremdsprache&quot;, DaF) at all levels: A1 up to C2. These can be taken both in Germany and abroad and have been adapted to fit into the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), the standard for European language testing. There is also one exam, the &quot;Großes Deutsches Sprachdiplom&quot;, which is at a still higher level than the highest CEFR level. Below is a table of the basic Goethe-Institut exams as they fit into the scheme:
In 2000, the Goethe-Institut helped to found the Society for Academic Test Development (&quot;Gesellschaft für Akademische Testentwicklung e.V.&quot;). The resulting TestDaF exams are run by the TestDaF-Institut in Hagen. The tests are supported by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and are aimed at people who would like to study at German universities, academics and scientists. The TestDaF can be taken in Germany as well as in 65 other countries. For language teachers, there is the &quot;Green Diploma&quot; to acquire and prove qualifications in teaching German as a foreign language.

==Awards and Residency programs==
The two US-related annually granted awards for literature translations from German into English are the renowned Helen and Kurt Wolff Translator&#x27;s Prize, and the &quot;Gutekunst Prize of the Friends of Goethe New York&quot;. The latter is open to college students and to all translators under the age of 35 who, at the time the prize is awarded, have not yet published.

=== Helen and Kurt Wolff Translator&#x27;s Prize ===
=== Goethe Medal ===

Once a year, the Goethe-Institut awards the Goethe Medal, an official decoration of the Federal Republic of Germany. It honours foreign personalities who have performed outstanding service for the German language and international cultural relations. The Goethe Medal was established by the executive committee of the Goethe-Institut in 1954 and acknowledged as an official decoration by the Federal Republic of Germany in 1975.

<text>John Edmund Andrew Phillips (August 30, 1935 – March 18, 2001) was an American musician. He was the leader of the vocal group the Mamas &amp; the Papas and remains frequently referred to as Papa John Phillips. In addition to writing the majority of the group&#x27;s compositions, he also wrote &quot;San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)&quot; in 1967 for former Journeymen bandmate Scott McKenzie, as well as the oft-covered &quot;Me and My Uncle&quot;, which was a favorite in the repertoire of the Grateful Dead. Phillips was one of the chief organizers of the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival.

== Early life ==
Phillips was born August 30, 1935, in Parris Island, South Carolina. His father, Claude Andrew Phillips, was a retired United States Marine Corps officer. On his way home from France following World War I, Claude Phillips managed to win a tavern located in Oklahoma from another Marine during a poker game. His mother, Edna Gertrude (née Gaines), who had English ancestry, met his father in Oklahoma. According to Phillips&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Papa John&quot;, his father was a heavy drinker who suffered from poor health.

Phillips grew up in Alexandria, Virginia, where he was inspired by Marlon Brando to be &quot;street tough&quot;. From 1942 to 1946, he attended Linton Hall Military School in Bristow, Virginia. According to his autobiography, he &quot;hated the place,&quot; citing &quot;inspections,&quot; and &quot;beatings,&quot; and recalls that &quot;nuns even watched us take showers&quot;. He formed a musical group of teenage boys, who sang doo-wop songs. He played basketball at George Washington High School, now George Washington Middle School in Alexandria, Virginia, where he graduated in 1953, and gained an appointment to the United States Naval Academy. However, he resigned during his first (plebe) year. Phillips then attended Hampden–Sydney College, a liberal arts college for men in Hampden Sydney, Virginia, dropping out in 1959.

== Career ==
=== Early years ===
Phillips traveled to New York in the early 1960s in the hope of gaining a record contract. His first band, The Journeymen, was a folk trio, with Scott McKenzie and Dick Weissman. They were fairly successful, putting out three albums, and had several appearances on the 1960s TV show &quot;Hootenanny&quot;. All three albums, as well as a compilation titled &quot;Best of the Journeymen&quot;, have since been reissued on CD. He developed his craft in Greenwich Village, during the American folk music revival, and met future Mamas &amp; the Papas members Denny Doherty and Cass Elliot there around that time. Lyrics in the group&#x27;s song &quot;Creeque Alley&quot; describe this period.

=== The Mamas and the Papas ===
Phillips was the primary songwriter and musical arranger of the Mamas and the Papas. In a 1968 interview, Phillips described some of his arrangements as &quot;well-arranged two-part harmony moving in opposite directions&quot;. After being signed to Dunhill, they had six &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Ten hits – &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Monday, Monday&quot;, &quot;I Saw Her Again&quot;, &quot;Creeque Alley&quot;, &quot;Words of Love&quot; and &quot;Dedicated to the One I Love&quot;.

Phillips helped promote the Monterey International Pop Music Festival held June 16– 18, 1967, in Monterey, California; he performed with the Mamas and the Papas as part of the event as well. The festival was planned in just seven weeks, and was developed as a way to validate rock music as an art form in the way jazz and folk were regarded. It was the first major pop-rock music event in history. He also co-produced the film &quot;Monterey Pop&quot; (1968) with the group&#x27;s producer Lou Adler.

John and Michelle Phillips became Hollywood celebrities, living in the Hollywood Hills and socializing with stars such as Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty, and Roman Polanski. The Mamas and the Papas broke up in 1968 largely because Cass Elliot wanted to go solo and because of personal problems between Phillips, his wife Michelle, and Denny Doherty, including Michelle&#x27;s affair with Doherty. As Michelle Phillips later recounted, &quot;Cass confronted me and said &#x27;I don&#x27;t get it. You could have any man you want. Why would you take mine?&#x27;&quot; Michelle Phillips was fired briefly in 1966 for having affairs with Gene Clark and Doherty. She was replaced for two months by Jill Gibson, their producer Lou Adler&#x27;s girlfriend. Although Phillips was forgiven and asked to return to the group, the personal problems continued until the group split. Elliot went on to have a successful solo career until her death in 1974.

== Later years and death ==
Phillips released his first solo album, &quot;John, the Wolf King of L.A.&quot;, in 1970. The album was not commercially successful, although it did include the minor hit &quot;Mississippi&quot;, and Phillips began to withdraw from the limelight as his use of narcotics increased.

He teamed up with Adler again to produce Robert Altman&#x27;s 1970 film &quot;Brewster McCloud&quot; and also wrote the songs for the film.

Phillips produced his third wife Genevieve Waite&#x27;s album &quot;Romance Is on the Rise&quot;, and wrote music for films. Between 1969 and 1974, Phillips and Waïte worked on a script and composed over 30 songs for a space-themed musical called &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, which was eventually produced by Andy Warhol but played for just two days in New York after receiving disastrous opening night reviews.

Phillips moved to London in 1973, where Mick Jagger encouraged him to record another solo album. It was to be released on Rolling Stones Records and funded by RSR distributor Atlantic Records. Jagger and Keith Richards produced and played on the album, as well as former Stone Mick Taylor and future Stone Ronnie Wood. The project was derailed by Phillips&#x27;s increasing use of cocaine and heroin, which he injected, by his own admission, &quot;almost every fifteen minutes for two years&quot;. In 2001, the tracks of the &quot;Half Stoned&quot; or &quot;The Lost Album&quot; album were released as &quot;Pay Pack &amp; Follow&quot; a few months after Phillips&#x27;s death. In 1975 Phillips, still living in London, was commissioned to create the soundtrack to the Nicolas Roeg film &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot;, starring David Bowie. Phillips asked Mick Taylor to help out; the film was released in 1976.

In 1981, Phillips was convicted of drug trafficking. Subsequently, he and his daughter Mackenzie made the rounds in the media in an anti-drug campaign, helping to reduce his prison time to a month in jail, of which he spent three weeks (one week off for good behavior) at Allenwood Prison Camp, in Allenwood, Pennsylvania. Upon his release, he re-formed the Mamas and the Papas with Mackenzie Phillips, Spanky McFarlane (of the group Spanky and Our Gang) and Denny Doherty. Throughout the rest of his life, Phillips toured with various incarnations of this group.

His autobiography, &quot;Papa John&quot;, was published in 1986.

With Terry Melcher, Mike Love, and former Journeymen colleague Scott McKenzie, he co-wrote the number-one single &quot;Kokomo&quot; for the Beach Boys. The song was used in the 1988 film &quot;Cocktail&quot; and was nominated for a Grammy Award (Best Song Written specifically for a Motion Picture or Television) and a Golden Globe Award for Best Song.

His years of drug addiction resulted in health problems that required a liver transplant in 1992. Several months later, photographs of him drinking alcohol in a bar in Palm Springs, California, were published in the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;. On March 14, 1994, during his first &quot;Howard Stern Show&quot; appearance since the transplant, he said, &quot;Occasionally I have a drink&quot;, when asked if he still drank.

Phillips spent his last years in Palm Springs, California, with Farnaz Arasteh, his fourth wife. On March 18, 2001, he died of heart failure in Los Angeles at the age of 65, days after completing recording sessions for a new album. He is interred at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Cathedral City, near Palm Springs where later his third wife Genevieve Waite was buried as well.

== Personal life ==
Phillips married Susan Adams of a wealthy Virginia family on May 7, 1957. They had a son, Jeffrey, and a daughter, Mackenzie.

While touring California with &quot;The Journeymen&quot;, Phillips met teenager Holly Michelle Gilliam, with whom he had an extramarital affair. The affair caused the dissolution of his marriage to Adams; subsequently he married Gilliam on December 31, 1962, and she thereafter became Michelle Phillips. The couple had one child together, Chynna Phillips, vocalist of the 1990s pop trio Wilson Phillips. Denny Doherty and Michelle started an affair in 1965. Phillips and Michelle divorced in May 1969.

Phillips married his third wife, actress and model Genevieve Waite, on January 30, 1972. The couple had two children, Tamerlane and Bijou Phillips. Phillips and Waite divorced in 1985.

Phillips married his fourth wife, painter and artist Farnaz Arasteh, on February 3, 1995.

== Abuse allegations ==
In September 2009, eight years after Phillips&#x27;s death, his eldest daughter Mackenzie alleged that she and her father had a 10-year abusive and incestuous relationship. In her memoir &quot;High on Arrival&quot;, Mackenzie wrote that the relationship began in 1979 when she was 19 years old. She said that the abuse began after Phillips raped her while they were both under the influence of heavy narcotics on the eve of her first marriage. On &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; on September 23, 2009, Mackenzie Phillips said that her father injected her with cocaine and heroin. According to Phillips, the sexual abuse ended when she became pregnant and did not know who had fathered the child; she said these doubts led her to have an abortion her father paid for. She stated, &quot;I never let him touch me again.&quot;

Genevieve Waite, John&#x27;s wife at the time, denied the allegations, saying they were inconsistent with his character. Michelle Phillips, John&#x27;s second wife, also stated that she had &quot;every reason to believe [Mackenzie&#x27;s account is] untrue&quot;. Chynna Phillips, Michelle Phillips&#x27;s daughter, stated that she believed Mackenzie&#x27;s claims and that Mackenzie first told her about the sexual assault during a phone conversation in 1997, approximately 11 years after the events had ended. Bijou Phillips, Mackenzie&#x27;s half-sister from her father&#x27;s marriage to Genevieve Waite, has stated that Mackenzie informed her of the sexual abuse when Bijou was 13 years old, and the information had a devastating effect on Bijou&#x27;s teenage years, stripping her of her innocence and leaving her &quot;wary of [her] father&quot;. She also stated, &quot;I&#x27;m 29 now, I&#x27;ve talked to everyone who was around during that time, I&#x27;ve asked the hard questions. I do not believe my sister. Our father [was] many things. This is not one of them.&quot; Jessica Woods, daughter of Denny Doherty, said that her father had told her that he knew &quot;the awful truth&quot; and that he was &quot;horrified at what John had done&quot;.

== Awards and honors ==
In 1996, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to Phillips.

The Mamas and the Papas were inducted into the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Hall of Fame on January 12, 1998, and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2000.

<text>Ethel Dorothy Blondin-Andrew (born 25 March 1951) is a Canadian politician, educator, and public servant. She became the first Indigenous woman to be elected to the Parliament of Canada in 1988 when she became a member of Parliament for the district of Western Arctic in the Northwest Territories. She is also the first Indigenous woman to be a Canadian Cabinet Minister.

== Early life ==
Blondin-Andrew was born 25 March 1951 in Tulita, Northwest Territories. She is a Dene woman. In 1959, she was sent to Grollier Hall in Inuvik, a residential school. She left the school to live in a tent town with other runaway students. When she was twelve, she went to the hospital for back surgery and discovered that she was ill with tuberculosis. After she recovered, she moved to Délı̨nę with her parents, where a local priest wrote her a recommendation letter for Grandin College, a leadership school in Fort Smith, which accepted her application.

She received a B.Ed from the University of Alberta in 1974, specialising in linguistics and literacy. In 1984, she became National Manager of the Indigenous Development Participation Programme which was run by the Canadian Public Service. She was appointed executive director two years later.

== Political career ==
In 1986, she became Assistant Deputy Minister of Culture for the Northwest Territories. In this role, she became involved in the Assembly of First Nations Aboriginal Language Foundation and the North American Language Institute. She was approached to run for the Territorial Council of the Northwest Territories but instead she ran to be Member of Parliament for the Western Arctic in the 1988 federal election. She won and while an MP, she became the Liberal Party&#x27;s Assistant Critic for employment equity and Aboriginal affairs. She also served as chair of the Northern and Western Caucus and the Caucus Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, and as a member of the Special Joint Committee on a Renewed Canada, the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, the Standing Committee on Northern Development, and the Standing Committee on Electoral Reform. She gave her first speech in the House of Commons in the Dene language.

Following the 1993 federal election, the Liberal Party became the majority party and when Jean Chrétien became Prime Minister, Blondin-Andrew was appointed Secretary of State for Training and Youth on 4 November 1993. She helped create both Youth Service Canada and the Youth Employment Strategy. On 10 August 1998, she was elected chair for the Main Committee of the World Conference of Ministers Responsible for Youth in Lisbon. On 11 June 1997, she became Secretary of State (Children and Youth).

When Paul Martin succeed Jean Chrétien as Prime Minister, he appointed Blondin-Andrew as Minister of State (Children and Youth) on 12 December 2003. She served in this role until 20 July 2004, when she became Minister of State (Northern Development). She was re-elected in the 2004 federal election by a razor-thin margin of 53 votes, and was voted out of office in the 2006 federal election, after 17 years of service.

In 2001, her work for Aboriginal communities was formally recognized by Brock University, who awarded her an honorary doctorate. She was also awarded a Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal by the Governor General of Canada in 2012. She also received the 2019 &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; Lifetime Achievement Award given to former MPs.

== Later career ==
Blondin-Andrew was the Chair of Sahtu Secretarial Incorporated from 2009 until September 2018. She currently works with the Indigenous Leadership Initiative.

== Personal life ==
Blondin-Andrew currently lives in Norman Wells. She is married to Leon Andrew and has four children and four grandchildren.

<doc id="470347" wikidata="Q741600" url="?curid=470347" title="Hank Williams III">
<text>Shelton Hank Williams (born December 12, 1972), known professionally as Hank Williams III, is an American singer, songwriter, and multiinstrumentalist. He was the drummer of hardcore punk band Arson Anthem, and bassist of Phil Anselmo&#x27;s band Superjoint Ritual. Predominantly styled in country music, punk rock and heavy metal, he has released eleven studio albums, five of which under the label Curb Records.

Williams is the grandson of Hank Williams and the son of Hank Williams Jr. He is also the nephew of Jett Williams, the half-brother of Holly Williams and Sam Williams, and is also the father of Coleman Williams.

==Career==

===Early career===
Williams spent much of his early career playing drums in punk rock bands during the late 1980s and early-to-mid-1990s. During this time frame, Williams was informed that he had fathered a son, Coleman Finchum, who was five years old by that time; a family court judge ordered Williams to find more stable employment so that Finchum could receive child support.

Williams later played bass guitar in the heavy metal band Superjoint Ritual, now renamed as Superjoint for legal reasons, led by Pantera vocalist Phil Anselmo. Williams also played drums for Arson Anthem, formed with Anselmo and Mike Williams of the sludge metal band Eyehategod.

=== Recordings for Curb Records (1996–2010) ===
Capitalizing on his family name and resemblance to his grandfather, he signed a contract with Nashville music industry giant Curb Records. &quot;Three Hanks: Men with Broken Hearts&quot; was issued shortly thereafter, which spliced together recordings to make it seem that three generations of Williams men were singing alongside one another. In the late 1980s, upon first meeting Hank Williams III, Minnie Pearl, a friend of the late Hank Williams Sr., reportedly said &quot;Lord, honey, you&#x27;re a ghost&quot;, as she was astonished by his striking resemblance to his grandfather.

The success of the &quot;Three Hanks&quot; album garnered Hank Jr. and Hank III a Vocal Duo of the Year nomination by the Academy of Country Music in 1997.

Williams&#x27; first solo album, &quot;Risin&#x27; Outlaw&quot;, was released in September 1999 to respectable sales and strong reviews, despite Williams&#x27;s own hatred of the record.

In 2003, Williams recorded &quot;This Ain&#x27;t Country&quot; for Curb, who chose not to release it. On May 17, 2011, Curb released the album under the title &quot;Hillbilly Joker&quot;, without the consent or input from Williams after his contract with the label had been terminated.

In 2006, after resolving a contractual dispute with Curb Records, Williams released &quot;Straight to Hell&quot; on Curb&#x27;s rock imprint, Bruc. Battles with Walmart delayed the appearance of this album, which was released on February 28, 2006, as a two-disc set in two formats: a censored version (for Wal-Mart), and an uncensored version that was the first major-label country album ever to bear a parental advisory warning. &quot;Straight to Hell&quot; was also the first release through Curb&#x27;s Bruc Records imprint. However, the uncensored version was released through Bruc, and the clean version was released through Curb. One of the songs, &quot;Pills I Took&quot;, was written by a little-known Wisconsin group called Those Poor Bastards, who originally released the song on their 2004 CD &quot;Country Bullshit&quot;.

Williams released Assjack&#x27;s self-titled debut album on August 4, 2009, through Curb.

His next album, &quot;Rebel Within&quot;, was released in May 2010, and was his last album with Curb Records. It charted at number 20 in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine.

Between 2012 and 2017, Curb would release a series of unauthorized compilations of Williams&#x27; music. In 2012, Curb released a Williams album titled &quot;Long Gone Daddy&quot;, marking the second album the company has released under his name since his departure. In 2014, Curb Records released a new album under Hank Williams III&#x27;s name titled &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Man&quot;. The album contains previously unreleased material that Williams recorded while on their label. The following year, Curb released another Williams album of previously unreleased songs titled &quot;Take as Needed for Pain&quot;. The album is mostly a rock album but the single released was a country song titled &quot;Ruby Get Back to the Hills&quot;. In 2017, Curb released a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album featuring select tracks from Williams&#x27; first four albums, mostly from &quot;Straight to Hell&quot;.

===Independent releases (2011–2014)===

Williams released four new CDs in September 2011. &quot;Ghost to a Ghost/Gutter Town&quot; (a 2-disc country record with some ambient and folk influences), &quot;3 Bar Ranch Cattle Callin&#x27;&quot; (a metal record in the newly anointed cattle core genre) and &quot;Attention Deficit Domination&quot; (a doom-rock record), were released under his label Hank3 Records through Megaforce Records, and featured guest appearances by Tom Waits, Les Claypool (Primus), Alan King (Hellstomper), Ray Lawrence Jr., Troy Medlin (Sourvein), Dave Sherman (Earthride) and Williams&#x27; dog, Trooper.

In 2013, Williams two new albums: a country album &quot;Brothers of the 4×4&quot; and punk album &quot;A Fiendish Threat&quot;, under the band name &quot;3&quot;.

In 2018, Williams was featured on DevilDriver&#x27;s cover of his song &quot;Country Heroes&quot;, which appears on their album &quot;Outlaws &#x27;til the End: Vol. 1&quot;. In 2021, he released a cover of the David Allan Coe song &quot;You Never Even Called Me By My Name&quot; on his YouTube channel.

== Musical style ==

Williams&#x27; lyrical themes include drug use, hedonism and the outlaw life, as well as criticism of the mainstream country music industry. 

His live shows typically follow a Jekyll and Hyde format: a country music set featuring fiddle player David McElfresh and steel guitar player Dan Johnson, followed by a &quot;hellbilly&quot; set of cowpunk and psychobilly songs, and then an Assjack set, which consists of death metal and metalcore songs.

The lineup for Assjack includes the addition of supplemental vocalist Gary Lindsey and the departure of his fiddle and steel guitar players. McElfresh&#x27;s predecessor was fellow-fiddle-player Michael &quot;Fiddleboy&quot; McCanless, who would play all three sets, adding traditional violin for the country set of the concert before turning on different effect pedals for later sets. Another former band member was guitarist Duane Denison, previously with The Jesus Lizard, who left The Damn Band and Assjack in January 2001 and later that year formed Tomahawk.

<text>Events in the year 1922 in [[Germany]].

==Incumbents==
===National level===

* President - Friedrich Ebert (Social Democrats)

* Chancellor - Joseph Wirth (Centre) (to 22 November), Wilhelm Cuno (Non-partisan) (from 22 November)

== Overview ==
Issues of disarmament and the trial of war criminals had previously been similar sources of anxiety and unrest in Germany, but now receded into the background. In their place was the issue of reparations, which dominated the life of Germans in 1922. Although these social questions remained in the public consciousness, Germans focused most heavily on the economics of how Germany would meet the reparation obligations stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles.

== Reparation battles ==
===Revisions and requests===
On March 21, the Reparations Commission answered by fixing the obligations of Germany at the figures proposed by the German government, but with certain conditions which would have to be carried out by May 31, including requiring a new taxation scheme of 60 billion marks. A number of measures for securing strict control over German finances and the German budget were required to be introduced at early dates, and the scheme for an internal loan submitted by April 30.

By 248 votes to 81, with 43 abstentions, the Reichstag on March 30 passed a resolution protesting the new regulations, which many believed would cause the rapid depreciation of German money.

===The World Economic Congressional meeting in Genoa===
Meanwhile, the great World Economic Congress met in Genoa—the one positive result of the Cannes conference. The congress lost much of its significance for Germany as France had consented to take part in it only on condition that reparations were not officially raised. Nevertheless, the German government regarded the congress as a moral victory. Yet very little actual progress was made.

===Recognition of Soviet Russia===
The German delegation became the object of unwelcome attention when it concluded a political and economic agreement with the Russian foreign minister Georgi Chicherin in Rapallo on Easter Sunday (April 16). The agreement had been drawn up in Berlin, but laid aside before being finally adopted. This agreement finally established peace between the two countries, waived all claims arising from the war on both sides and restored diplomatic relations. Thus, the Bolshevist government was accorded open recognition. The former Russian ambassador&#x27;s palace in Berlin, after being empty for years, had already been handed over. This step added some difficulty to the negotiations of the Great Powers with the Moscow government due to the open hostility that many of the European democracies displayed against the Communist regime.

German delegates&#x27; assurances that no disloyalty had been intended by these agreements were rejected with scorn. German delegates futilely asserted that they had reliable information that the other powers were about to conclude arrangements with Russia which would put Germany in a tight corner if she did not act quickly. The French delegation showed itself particularly indignant, as did the British.

===Negotiating an international loan===
Of more consequence to Germany was the approach of May 31, with the threat of dire consequences if the obligations fixed by the Reparations Commission were not carried out. New French Prime Minister Raymond Poincaré had already set forth the programme of pledges and sanctions with which he meant to overcome the alleged &quot;bad will&quot; of Germany. Accordingly, the German finance minister, Andreas Hermes, went to Paris. As a result of his discussions with the Reparations Commission, the government was able to make a proposal that was accepted. The government promised to keep its finances in order so that it could pay the reparations, even if it meant raising taxes. The Reparations Commission consented.

===Loan renegotiation===
At the beginning of November the Reparations Commission went to Berlin in the hope of there finding a way out of the impasse. At the same time, a conference was held in Berlin of economic and financial authorities who had been asked to give reasoned opinions on the possibility of stabilizing the mark. Both conferences ended without positive result. The Reparations Commission failed to find the concrete proposals that it had looked for.

On November 13, the Wirth government made definite proposals regarding stabilization and reparations in a note to the Reparations Commission. These proposals were: to fix the German reparation obligations definitely at a tolerable figure, to release Germany for three to four years from all payments in cash and kind, to summon an immediate conference of international financiers to consider the granting of a bank credit to Germany, and, finally, to support Germany&#x27;s demand for complete equality of treatment in trade and commerce.

==Politics==
===Assassination and instability===
The most serious event of the year internally occurred on the morning of June 24, when Walther Rathenau was shot dead by assassins in front of his house. Walther Rathenau was the minister for foreign affairs. This event spurred another economic downturn for the Weimar Republic. Four days before the assassination, the Mark was still at one sixty-seventh of its par value. On June 27, just one week later, it had sunk to one-eightieth of par, on July 3 to one hundred-and-fourteenth, and on August 1 to one hundred-and-fiftieth.

Owing to this new development, the German government on July 12 made a fresh application for postponement of the payments that had been fixed for 1922, and for a simultaneous reduction of the monthly payments for the clearing of private prewar claims from £2,000,000 to £500,000. The Reparations Commission promised to reply, if possible, by August 15. But France returned an abrupt negative to the request for a reduction of the clearing payments, and even threatened reprisals if Germany did not carry out its clearing obligations by August 5. Eventually, an agreement was reached, and Germany was allowed to stop cash payments for the rest of 1922 via a conference of the Allies, which commenced on August 7.

===Inflation and repercussions===
Despite the ending of cash payments for the rest of 1922, the main cause of Germany&#x27;s inability to pay, the steady depreciation of the mark, was ongoing. Towards the end of the year it assumed a disastrous rapidity. On August 1, the US Dollar still stood at 643 Marks to the Dollar and the British Pound at 2,850 Marks to the Pound. But on September 5 the dollar had already risen to 1,440 Marks and the pound to 6,525 Marks, and in December the pound was worth between 30,000 and 40,000 marks and the dollar between 7,000 and 9,000.

In such circumstances it was impossible to exercise proper supervision over the national finances. The budget submitted at the beginning of the year had provided for an ordinary revenue and expenditure of 103,208,000,000 Marks.
With the mark at one forty-fifth of its par value, the cost of carrying out the terms of the peace treaty was now 187,531,000,000 marks. Of this sum 16,500,000,000 were provided by the ordinary budget; the other 171,000,000,000 would have had to be raised by a loan. As soon as the mark fell to a sixtieth of par the deficit became 210,000,000,000 instead of 171,000,000,000; and it swelled to fantastic dimensions with the further depreciation of the mark which followed. The floating debt had risen from 247,000,000,000 at the beginning of the year to 272,000,000,000 by March 31, then to 962,000,000,000 and to 1,494,000,000,000 by the end of the year.

The government sought to prevent the further fall of the mark by a regulation forbidding dealing in foreign currencies. The measure, however, was not well conceived and proved wholly ineffective; it met with sharp opposition, and soon had to be altered.

===Cuno takes over as Chancellor===
Late in 1922, the Wirth cabinet found itself compelled to resign owing to party dissensions. In order to secure a broader basis for his government in the critical situation which faced the republic, Dr. Wirth had sought to gain the adherence of the German People&#x27;s Party, which represented the property-owning classes. Previously, the moderate socialist party had reunited with the Independent Social Democrats who had seceded during the war, while as a kind of counterpoise the bourgeois parties in the government coalition had formed a &quot;working agreement&quot; in the Reichstag with the German People&#x27;s Party. The united Social Democrats objected to the entry of the German People&#x27;s Party into the government coalition. Having made this a question of confidence, Dr. Wirth felt himself compelled to resign.

The president entrusted the formation of a new cabinet to Dr. Wilhelm Cuno, manager of the Hamburg-America Line, who accomplished the task with some difficulty. As the Social Democrats refused to join, Dr. Cuno formed a so-called business ministry, which usually is composed of non-politicians. In this case, however, it was largely composed of deputies of the bourgeois coalition in addition to Cuno, who did not belong to any party and in fact was not a member of the Reichstag when he first took over. These parties did not form a majority in the House by themselves. Consequently, the cabinet depended on the good will either of the Social Democrats or the German Nationalists.

Cuno&#x27;s cabinet was as follows:
* Wilhelm Cuno – Chancellor
* Frederic Hans von Rosenberg - Foreign Minister
* Rudolf Oeser (German Democratic Party (DDP)) – Interior Minister
* Andreas Hermes (German Centre Party (Z)) – Finance Minister
* Johannes Becker (German People&#x27;s Party (DVP)) – Economics Minister
* Heinrich Brauns (Z) – Labour Minister
* Rudolf Heinze (DVP) – Justice Minister
* Otto Gessler (DDP) – Defence Minister
* Karl Stingl (Bavarian Centre Party (BVP)) – Postal Minister
* Wilhelm Groener – Transport Minister
* Hans Luther – Food Minister
* Heinrich Albert – Treasury Minister of Germany and Reconstruction Minister of Germany

The new government continued the reparations policy of its predecessor. When a conference of the Allies met in London to consider the German request for a postponement of payment, the new government made fresh proposals on matters of detail regarding the periods and the application of the loans it had in view. The conference rejected the proposals as inadequate. The London negotiations brought no solution of the reparations question. Poincaré&#x27;s plans for the seizing of &quot;productive pledges&quot; and the occupation of the Ruhr valley met with the opposition of the other powers, while Poincaré on his side was not to be moved from his designs, which were of a military and political rather than economic character, by any offers of United Kingdom for a mutual cancellation of debts. Thus the year ended with a situation full of ominous uncertainty.

=== Internal unrest ===
The internal position of the republic was somewhat weakened by unrest arising from economic fragility, which resulted from uncertainty concerning the war debts and its adverse effect on the economy. In February, a strike engineered by the more reckless elements of labor among the railway employees paralyzed traffic for six days in North Germany and a part of Baden. It then collapsed, and was followed by disciplinary action against some of the instigators and also those participators in the strike who had been guilty of acts of violence and sabotage. The government, supported by public opinion, held that state employees had no right to strike, and received a vote of confidence on this point in the Reichstag. A frivolous strike of the Berlin municipal workers, which left the capital without light, water, and electricity, ended after three days with an unconditional resumption of work. Food disturbances broke out at some places in the summer, but they were easily suppressed.

More disturbing to the peace of the republic were the subterraneous movements which were forming in anti-republican circles. The preceding year had been marked by the murder of Matthias Erzberger. This year was marked by the aforementioned murder of Walther Rathenau, an attempt to poison Philipp Scheidemann, the lord mayor of Kassel, with prussic acid on Whit Monday, and the stabbing of journalist Maximilian Harden on July 3. The feeling aroused found vent in great demonstrations on the part of the republican section of the population, especially among the working classes. In certain places, &quot;e.g.&quot;, Zwickau, near Magdeburg, Freiburg, Darmstadt, etc., violent exhibitions of popular resentment erupted, at times accompanied by bloodshed.

=== Political repercussions ===
The republican authorities acted with great energy and proclaimed relentless warfare against the &quot;Right&quot;. An order (invoking Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution) was issued investing the government with extraordinary powers to cope with the emergency. A few days later it was withdrawn in favour of a bill for the protection of the republic, increasing the penalties for attacks on republican institutions and officials, establishing a special State Court alongside the German High Court for trying such cases, and banning societies, meetings, and printed matter that opposed &quot;the constitutionally established republican form of government&quot;. It was followed by an amnesty bill, a crimes bill, and a supplement to the officials law. The Reichstag passed the Law for the Protection of the Republic after a long discussion by 303 votes to 102. The other bills were also passed by large majorities. Only the German Nationalists, the Bavarian People&#x27;s Party, the Communists, and certain members of the German People&#x27;s Party voted against them.

===Politically motivated trials===
In response to the Law for the Protection of the Republic, a number of organizations which espoused anti-republican sentiment were dissolved, including the Organisation Consul, which was responsible for the assassinations of Matthias Erzberger on 26 August 1921 and Walther Rathenau on 24 June 1922. In the trial of ex-Captain Manfred von Killinger in May for abetting the murder of Erzberger, the two assassins to whom Killinger had given the orders escaped and Killinger was acquitted, although his connection with the murderers of Erzberger was not in doubt. The murderers of Rathenau, the engineer Hermann Fischer and Naval Lieutenant (retired) Erwin Kern, had escaped arrest and condemnation by suicide. A number of persons who were accused partly of complicity, partly of abetting or assisting, were brought before the new court in October. Thirteen were convicted.

A political trial held at Munich was of quite a different character. The author Freiherr Hubert von Leoprechting was on trial for high treason. This man was accused of being in the pay of Dard, the French envoy in Munich, who left the city for good a few days before the trial. It came out in the trial that Dard had acquainted the accused with the plans for separating South from North Germany, and that these plans were, if necessary, to be assisted by an advance of French troops through the Main valley. He was condemned to imprisonment for life and loss of civil rights.

Wolfgang Kapp, the instigator of the notorious Kapp Putsch of March 1920, was going to put to trial, but died before he could put on trial.

== Treaties and the Creation of Poland ==
A number of treaties were concluded with various states, including Switzerland, the United States, Italy, Latvia, and Finland. Most were economic in character, and served to clear away the debris left by the war. The extension of the Russo-German Treaty of Rapallo to the Soviet republics federated with Russia took place as a matter of course, and aroused no attention.

The Second Polish Republic and Germany made good progress towards coming to terms on the question of Upper Silesia. Through the mediation of the Swiss deputy Felix Calonder, the two countries came to an agreement in April. The agreement was designed to last fifteen years, which gave prospect of a lasting settlement. The most difficult questions were those of the protection of minorities, and of German private property liquidation in the portions of Upper Silesia assigned to Poland. Difficulties arose when Poland claimed an unrestricted right of liquidation, and failed to recognize the right of the chairman of the Mixed Commission to arbitrate. A compromise was reached, in which Poland gained a limited right of liquidation, without inflicting too great a hardship on the German owners.

On July 17, the transfer to Poland of the parts of Upper Silesia assigned to her commenced. At the same time, large portions of the population moved from newly-Polish districts into the parts that remained German. A few weeks later, the German districts voted on whether they should become an autonomous federated state, or remain incorporated with Prussia. The result was: 513,126 votes for Prussia, 50,400 for autonomy. It was now possible to hold the elections to the Reichstag (institution) and the Prussian Landtag which had been postponed on account of the occupation. They ended unfavourably for the Poles, who won no seat out of five in the Reichstag, and only one out of eight in the Landtag.

Great dissatisfaction arose in Germany in response to the fate of five villages on the east bank of the Vistula. These villages had formerly belonged to West Prussia, were inhabited almost entirely by Germans, and had voted to remain in Germany in the East Prussian plebiscite. The boundary commission nevertheless assigned them to the Polish Corridor, in spite of protests by the inhabitants, the Reichstag, and the Prussian Landtag. The Prussian premier Otto Braun emphatically stigmatized this decision as a &quot;scandalous breach of the peace of Versailles&quot;. The protest was so effective that the execution of the decision was postponed and had not yet been carried out at the end of the year.

<text>Olympic Aviation was a subsidiary of Olympic Airways, the Greek national flag carrier.

==History==
Olympic Aviation was created on 2nd August 1971 to take over the operations of the light aircraft and helicopter division of Olympic Airways, with Alexander Onassis appointed as President. It expanded to provide an airline service between mainland Greece and various Greek islands inaccessible to the larger aircraft in the parent company (Olympic Airways) fleet, using types such as the BN-2 Islander and Short Skyvan. In 1980 when Olympic Airlines retired their YS-11 aircraft, Olympic Aviation took over their services with a fleet of Shorts 330. In 1984 a number of 19-seat Dornier 228 were introduced, replacing the Islanders &amp; Skyvans. And in 1990/91 a larger number of ATR 42 &amp; ATR 72 aircraft began arriving, replacing the Shorts 330s, and at the same time allowing a considerable increase in capacity. Finally in 1999 Olympic Aviation purchased three Boeing 717, their first jet aircraft.

The company was also responsible for charter flights in the Olympic Airways Group of Companies, until Macedonian Airlines was created in 1992.

=== Olympic Aviation Flight Academy ===
The Flight Academy operated under the supervision of Olympic Aviation, using flight simulators for ATR-42/72 aircraft, as well as Boeing 737-200/300/400 aircraft.

==Fleet==
===Airliner types re-integrated into Olympic Airlines at December 2003===
*ATR 42 (since 1990); 
*ATR 72 (since 1989); 
*Boeing 717-200 (since 2000); 

The three Boeing 717 aircraft were leased to serve some of Olympic Aviation&#x27;s European flights, based at Makedonia Airport of Thessaloniki. Shortly after the retirement of the Olympic Airways&#x27;s Boeing 737-200s, the 717s were used on Olympic Airways&#x27;s European destinations.

In December 2003, the flight academy as well as most of the Olympic Airways Group companies, became part of a new company called Olympic Airways - Services S.A.. Olympic Aviation continues to operate, mainly to provide helicopter charter services, under the Olympic Airways - Services management. Its turboprop and jet aircraft fleet, as well as that of Olympic Airways and Macedonian Airlines was integrated into a new company, Olympic Airlines.

==Accidents and incidents==
*22 January, 1973: a Piaggio P.136L-2 amphibious plane (SX-BDC) crashed shortly after takeoff from Athens (Ellinikon Airport) runway 33. The crash occurred as a result of the reversing of the aileron connecting cables during the installation of a new control column on the plane. President of Olympic Aviation, Alexander Onassis was evaluating a new pilot (Donald McCusker) and was accompanied by his then regular pilot (Donald McGregor). McCusker and McGregor survived with serious injuries, but Onassis died 27 hours later as a result of his injuries sustained in the accident.
*3 August, 1989: an Olympic Aviation Short 330, operating as Olympic Aviation Flight 545, flew into the cloud-shrouded Mount Kerkis on Samos island, Greece, while attempting a landing approach. All 3 crew members and 31 passengers were killed.

<doc id="470361" wikidata="Q813961" url="?curid=470361" title="Beja people">
<text>The Beja people (, , ) are a Cushitic ethnic group native to the Eastern Desert, inhabiting a coastal area from southeastern Egypt through eastern Sudan and into northwestern Eritrea. They are descended from peoples who have inhabited the area since 4000 BC or earlier, although they were Arabized by Arabs who settled in the region. They are nomadic and live primarily in the Eastern Desert. The Beja number around 1,900,000 to 2,759,000.

Some of the Beja speak a Cushitic language called Beja and some speak Tigre, an Ethiopian Semitic language; most speak Arabic. In Eritrea and southeastern Sudan, many members of the Beni-Amer grouping speak Tigre. Originally, the Beja did not speak Arabic, but the migration of the numerous Arab tribes of Juhaynah, Mudar, Rabi&#x27;a, and many more to the Beja areas contributed to the Arabization and Islamization of them. The Arabs did not however fully settle in the Beja areas as they looked for better climate in other areas. The Beja have partially mixed with Arabs through intermarriages over the centuries, and by the 15th century were absorbed into Islam. The process of Arabization led to the Beja adopting the Arabic language, Arab clothing, and Arab kinship organization.

While many secondary sources identify the Ababda as an Arabic-speaking Beja tribe because of their cultural links with the Bishari, this is a misconception; the Ababda do not consider themselves Beja, nor are they so considered by Beja people.

==History==

The Beja are traditionally Cushitic-speaking pastoral nomads native to northeast Africa, referred to as Blemmyes in ancient texts. The geographer Abu Nasr Mutahhar al-Maqdisi wrote in the tenth century that the Beja were at that time Christians. Beja territories in the Eastern desert were conquered and vassalised by the Kingdom of Aksum in the third century. The historian Al-Yaqubi documented five Beja Kingdoms in the 9th century. Originally, the Beja did not speak Arabic, however the migration of the numerous Arab tribes of Juhaynah, Mudar, Rabi&#x27;a, and many more to the Beja areas contributed to the Arabization and Islamization of them, however the Arabs did not fully settle in the Beja areas as they looked for better climate in other areas. The Beja have partially mixed with Arabs through intermarriages over the centuries, and by the 15th century, the Beja were Islamized. The Balaw of the southern Red Sea coast may have come from the mixing of people from the Arab Peninsula and Beja people, but there has been significant historical dispute on this matter. The Hadendoa Beja by the 18th century dominated much of eastern Sudan. In the Mahdist War of the 1880s to 1890s, the Beja fought on both sides, the Hadendoa siding with the Mahdist troops, while the Bisharin and Amarar tribes sided with the British, and some Beni Amer - a subset of the Beja who live largely in Eritrea sided with the Ethiopian Ras Alula in certain battles, such as Kufit.

The Beja Congress was formed in 1952 with the aim of pursuing regional autonomy from the government in Khartoum. Frustrated by the lack of progress, the Beja Congress joined the insurgent National Democratic Alliance in the 1990s. The Beja Congress effectively controlled a part of eastern Sudan centered on Garoura and Hamshkoraib. The Beja Congress sabotaged the oil pipeline to Port Sudan several times during 1999 and 2000. In 2003, they rejected the peace deal arranged between the Sudanese government and the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army, and allied with the rebel movement of the Darfur region, the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army, in January 2004. A peace agreement was signed with the government of Sudan in October 2006. In the general elections in April 2010, the Beja Congress did not win a single seat in the National Assembly in Khartoum. In anger over alleged election fraud and the slow implementation of the peace agreement, the Beja Congress in October 2011 withdrew from the agreement, and later announced an alliance with the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army.

==Geography==

The Beja people inhabit a general area between the Nile River and the Red Sea in Sudan, Eritrea and eastern Egypt known as the Eastern Desert. Most of them live in the Sudanese states of Red Sea around Port Sudan, River Nile, Al Qadarif and Kassala, as well as in Northern Red Sea, Gash-Barka, and Anseba Regions in Eritrea, and southeastern Egypt. There are smaller populations of other Beja ethnic groups further north into Egypt&#x27;s Eastern Desert. Some Beja groups are nomadic. The Kharga Oasis in Egypt&#x27;s Western Desert is home to a large number of Qamhat Bisharin who were displaced by the Aswan High Dam. Jebel Uweinat is revered by the Qamhat.

==Names==
The Beja have been named &quot;Blemmyes&quot; in Roman times, Bəga in Aksumite inscriptions in Ge&#x27;ez, and &quot;Fuzzy-Wuzzy&quot; by Rudyard Kipling. Kipling was specifically referring to the Hadendoa, who fought the British, supporting the Mahdi, the Sudanese leader of the war against Turkish-Egyptian rule, supported by the British Imperial administration.

==Language==

Many of the Beja speak Arabic, while some speak the Beja language, known as &quot;Bidhaawyeet&quot; or &quot;Tubdhaawi&quot; in that language. It belongs to the Cushitic branch of the Afroasiatic family. Cohen noted that the Beja language is the Cushitic language with the largest proportion of Semitic roots, and stated that they are in majority of Arabic origin.

The French linguist Didier Morin (2001) has made an attempt to bridge the gap between Beja and another branch of Cushitic, namely Lowland East Cushitic languages and in particular Afar and Saho, the linguistic hypothesis being historically grounded on the fact that the three languages were once geographically contiguous. Most Beja speak the Beja language, but certain subgroups use other lingua franca. The Beni Amers speak a variety of Tigre, whereas most of the Halenga speak Arabic.

Although there is a marked Arabic influence, the Beja language is still widely spoken. The very fact that the highest moral and cultural values of this society are in one way or the other linked to their expression in Beja, that Beja poetry is still highly praised, and that the claims over the Beja land are only valid when expressed in Beja, are very strong social factors in favour of its preservation. True enough Arabic is considered as the language of modernity, but it is also very low in the scale of Beja cultural values as it is a means of transgressing social prohibitions. Beja is still the prestigious language for most of its speakers because it conforms to the ethical values of the community.

==Subdivisions==

The Beja are divided into clans. These lineages include the Bisharin, Hedareb, Hadendowa (or &quot;Hadendoa&quot;), the Amarar (or &quot;Amar&#x27;ar&quot;), Beni-Amer, Hallenga, Habab, Belin and Hamran, some of whom are partly mixed with Bedouins in the east.

Beja society was traditionally organized into independent kingdoms. According to Al-Yaqubi, there were six such Beja polities that existed between Aswan and Massawa during the 9th century. Among these were the Kingdom of Bazin, Kingdom of Belgin, Kingdom of Jarin, Kingdom of Nagash, Kingdom of Qita&#x27;a and Kingdom of Tankish.

<doc id="470364" wikidata="Q27074788" url="?curid=470364" title="Calliope hummingbird">
<text>The calliope hummingbird ( ; Selasphorus calliope) is the smallest bird native to the United States and Canada. It has a western breeding range mainly from California to British Columbia, and migrates to the Southwestern United States, Mexico, and Central America for its wintering grounds. The calliope hummingbird is the smallest known long-distance bird migrant, completing migrations twice per year of some .

It was previously considered the only member of the genus &quot;Stellula&quot; (meaning &quot;little star&quot;), but research evidence suggests its existing placement in the genus &quot;Selasphorus&quot;. The bird was named after the Greek muse Calliope.

==Description==

The calliope is the smallest breeding bird found in Canada and the United States. An adult calliope hummingbird can measure in length, span across the wings and weigh .

Calliope hummingbirds have glossy green on the back and crown with white underparts. The adult male has wine-red streaks on the gorget, green flanks, and a dark tail. When an adult male is competing for territory or females, the dark red feathers of its gorget distend outwards to create a more distinct appearance. Females and immatures have a pinkish wash on the flanks, dark streaks on the throat and a dark tail with white tips. The only similar birds are the rufous hummingbird and the Allen&#x27;s hummingbird, but these birds are larger with more distinct and contrasting rufous markings on the tail and flanks, and longer central tail feathers.
==Habitat and distribution==
The breeding habitat of calliope hummingbird is varied among open shrub habitats and altitudes. Nesting usually occurs at higher altitudes in the Rocky Mountains. Nests have been observed from as low as in Oregon and Washington elevation to the tree line at over . In Montana, the minimum elevation observed for breeding is . Open montane forest, mountain meadows, and willow and alder thickets may variously serve as breeding grounds. During migration and winter, they also occur in chaparral, lowland brushy areas, deserts and semi-desert regions. They nest in western North America from southern British Columbia and Alberta south to Colorado and southern California. During winter, they move mainly through Arizona and New Mexico and northern Mexico, to winter in southwestern Mexico.

==Behavior==

Calliope hummingbirds are a migratory bird, generally leaving their breeding grounds earlier than most birds (although not as early as the rufous hummingbird) to take advantage of the late-summer wildflowers in the mountains of western North America. They are believed to be the smallest-bodied long distance migrant in the world.

These birds feed on nectar from flowers using a long extendable tongue, drink sap from holes created by sapsuckers or catch insects on the wing. While collecting nectar, they also assist in plant pollination. Plants preferred for pollinating include paintbrush, penstemon, columbine, trumpet gilia, and elephant head. They will also occasionally catch and eat small insects and spiders.

Adult males usually arrive on the breeding ground before females, from mid-April to early May. The male claims and vigorously defends a nesting territory in which he will breed with many females. The male takes no part in raising the young and often actually vacates the breeding grounds by the time the young hatch. The female usually builds an open cup nest in a conifer tree under an overhanging branch, though apple and alder trees have also been used. The nest is often built on the base of large pine cones and somewhat resembles a pine cone itself. A nest may be used repeatedly over the course of several years. Two eggs are laid from late May to early July and are incubated for 15 to 16 days. The young are capable of flight about 20 days after hatching.

===Humming===
The prominent humming sound of a calliope hummingbird as for all hummingbirds during flight and hovering derives from its rapid wingbeats while feeding or interacting with other hummingbirds. Humming serves as an audible communication to alert other birds of the arrival of a fellow forager or potential mate. The humming sound derives from aerodynamic forces generated by both the downstrokes and upstrokes of the rapid wingbeats, producing acoustic oscillations and harmonics.

===Courtship display and sonation===
During courtship, a male calliope hummingbird hovers at accelerated wingbeat frequency up to 95 flaps per second (42% higher than normal hovering), creating a loud buzzing sound, with throat feathers protruding and facing a female. The male then ascends temporarily to and dives at high speed, with the rapid descent causing sonation of wing and tail feathers combined with vocalization, intending to attract attention of the female. Research in a wind tunnel demonstrated that the male courtship display includes
sounds produced by three independent feather or vocal components, each with different acoustic characteristics, thus potentially containing different messages appealing to the female. The tail feathers flutter at high frequency and hit each other to produce the buzzing sound. Male calliope hummingbirds also make visual displays to females and nearby males by extending their purple gorget feathers to appear larger.
==Temperature regulation==

The high metabolic rate of calliope hummingbirds – especially during rapid forward flight and hovering – produces increased body heat that requires specialized mechanisms of temperature regulation for dissipating heat, which becomes an even greater challenge in hot, humid climates. As the smallest North American hummingbird species, calliopes appear to adapt their relatively higher surface-to-volume ratio to improve convective cooling from air movement by the wings. When air temperatures rise above , thermal gradients driving heat passively by convective dissipation from around the eyes, shoulders, and feet are reduced or eliminated, requiring heat dissipation mainly by evaporation and exhalation.

All hummingbirds dissipate heat partially by exhaled air, and from body structures with thin or no feather covering, such as around the eyes, shoulders, under the wings (patagia), and feet. While hovering, calliope hummingbirds do not benefit from the heat loss by air convection during forward flight, except for air movement generated by their rapid wing-beat, possibly aiding convective heat loss from the extended feet.

==Status==

As of 2019, calliope hummingbirds have a relatively stable breeding population of about 4.5 million. As this species has a restricted wintering range in Mexico and travels an exceptional migratory distance annually of up to 9,000 km, it is on a watchlist for factors that could diminish the population.

=== Threats ===
The calliope hummingbird does not have many predators. Its biggest threat is likely long cold spells since they reduce the volume of insects and nectar available in its environment. The calliope hummingbird may be aggressive in its territory with other hummingbird species and birds, including Gray Flycatchers, American Robins, and Red-tailed Hawks.

<text>was a town located in the Nishikanbara District of Niigata Prefecture, Japan. The town merged into Niigata city in October 2005 and now forms part of the Nishikan Ward of the city.

==History==
The town was established as a village in 1889 as a merger of Shimo-maki Village and other villages. It was promoted to a town in 1891. The population as of April 2005 was 29,039.

In June 2004 the town submitted a merger request to neighbouring Niigata city. In March 2005 the merger proposal was approved by the municipal assemblies of Maki and Niigata. The proposal was approved by the Niigata Prefectural Assembly and the Governor of Niigata Prefecture in July 2005 and by the Minister for Internal Affairs and Communications the following month. The merger came into force on 10 October 2005. On April 1, 2007 Niigata became a government-designated city and the area that was Maki became part of the city&#x27;s Nishikan Ward.
