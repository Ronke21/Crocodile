<text>Eqbal Ahmad (1933 – 11 May 1999) was a Pakistani political scientist, writer and academic known for his anti-war activism, his support for resistance movements globally and academic contributions to the study of the Near East. Born in Bihar, British India, Ahmad migrated to Pakistan as a child and went on to study economics at the Forman Christian College. After graduating, he worked briefly as an army officer and was wounded in the First Kashmir War in 1948. He participated in the Algerian Revolution, then studied the Vietnam War and U.S. imperialism, becoming an early opponent of the war upon his return to the U.S. in the mid-1960s.

While highly regarded in radical circles of South Asia and left-wing circles more generally, Ahmad was a controversial figure. According to Pervez Hoodbhoy, warrants of arrest and death sentences were put on him during successive martial law governments in Pakistan. Although he was indicted in 1971 on charges of conspiring to kidnap Henry Kissinger (who was then President Nixon&#x27;s National Security Advisor), the case was eventually dismissed. Kabir Babar called Ahmad &quot;one of the most outstanding thinkers ever to originate from the Subcontinent. His analyses of the major political events and trends of the 20th century were noted for their astuteness and predictive power.&quot; Edward Said listed Ahmad as one of the two most important influences on his intellectual development, praising the latter&#x27;s writings on South Asia especially as informative.

==Early life and education==

Eqbal Ahmad was born in the village of Irki in the Gaya District (now Magadh Division) of the Indian state of Bihar. When he was a young boy, his father was murdered over a land dispute in his presence by a hindu group. During the partition of India in 1947, he and his elder brother migrated to Pakistan on foot.

Eqbal Ahmad graduated from Forman Christian College in Lahore, Pakistan, in 1951 with a degree in economics. After serving briefly as an army officer, he enrolled at Occidental College in California in 1957, as a Rotary Fellow. In 1958, he went to Princeton University, where he studied political science and Middle Eastern history until earning his PhD in 1965.
During his time at Princeton, Ahmad travelled to Tunisia and Algeria as part of his doctoral dissertation. In Algiers, he supported the revolution, leading to his subsequent arrest in France. Ahmad went on to teach at the University of Illinois and at Cornell University until 1968. During this time, Ahmad also became a prominent fellow of the anti-war Institute for Policy Studies.

His vocal support of Palestinian rights during the 1967 war led to his isolation within the academic community, causing him to leave Cornell. From 1968 to 1972, he worked as a fellow at the University of Chicago. During this time, Ahmad became a prominent activist opposing the Vietnam War, which lead to his being charged as part of the Harrisburg Seven in January 1971. After the trial Ahmad was acquitted of all charges in 1972. He moved to Amsterdam in 1973. In 1974, he founded and directed the Transnational Institute, until 1975. In 1982, he moved back to the United States and joined Hampshire College as a tenured professor and taught there until becoming Professor Emeritus in 1997.

In 1990, he began splitting his time between Islamabad and Amherst and also began writing for &quot;Dawn&quot;, and worked unsuccessfully to establish a liberal arts college named after Ibn Khaldun in Islamabad. Ahmad was one of the most prominent left-wing academics in both Pakistan and the United States. His legacy is that of strong opposition to militarism, bureaucracy, nuclear arms and ideological rigidity, while a strongly supporting democracy and self-determination. Even though a little-known figure within Pakistan, Ahmad&#x27;s legacy in intellectual circles is strong both within the country and outside it.

==Career==
From 1960 to 1963, Ahmad lived in North Africa, working primarily in Algeria, where he joined the National Liberation Front and worked with Frantz Fanon and some Algerian nationalists who were fighting a war of liberation against the French in Algeria. He was offered an opportunity to join the first independent Algerian government, but refused in favour of life as an independent intellectual. Instead, he returned to the United States. Eqbal Ahmad was fluent in Urdu, English, Persian and Arabic.
When he returned to the United States, Eqbal Ahmad taught at the University of Illinois at Chicago (1964–65) and Cornell University in the school of Labour Relations (1965–68). Palestinian right of return Palestinian rights during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war 1967 war lead to his isolation within the academic community, causing him to leave Cornell. From 1968 to 1972, he worked as a fellow at the University of Chicago and the Adlai Stevenson Institute in Chicago. In 1971, Eqbal Ahmad was indicted as one of the Harrisburg Seven as a result of his activism against the Vietnam War alongside the anti-war Catholic priest Philip Berrigan, Berrigan&#x27;s future wife, Sister Elizabeth McAlister, and four other Catholic pacifists, on charges of conspiracy to kidnap Henry Kissinger. After fifty-nine hours of deliberations, the jury declared a mistrial and Ahmad was acquitted of all charges in 1972. During these years, he became known as one of the earliest and most vocal opponents of American policies in Vietnam and Cambodia. 

Eqbal Ahmad&#x27;s friend, author Stuart Schaar suggested in a book on Eqbal Ahmad that he had warned the US against attacking Iraq in 1990. He had correctly predicted that Saddam&#x27;s fall would bring in sectarian violence and chaos in the region. Eqbal Ahmad had also interviewed Osama bin Laden in Peshawar in 1986. In the early 1990s, he had predicted that considering the ideology of Osama Bin Laden, he would eventually turn against his then allies US and Pakistan.

From 1972 to 1982, Ahmad was Senior Fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies. From 1973 to 1975, he served as the first director of its overseas affiliate, the Transnational Institute in Amsterdam. In 1982, Ahmad joined the faculty at Hampshire College, in Amherst, Massachusetts, a progressive school which was the first college in the nation to divest from South Africa. There, he taught world politics and political science. In the early 1990s, Ahmad was granted a parcel of land in Pakistan by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s government, to build an independent, alternative university, named Khaldunia University.

Upon his retirement from Hampshire in 1997, he settled permanently in Pakistan, where he continued to write a weekly column, for &quot;Dawn&quot;, Pakistan&#x27;s oldest English-language newspaper. He continued to promote Scandinavian-style social democracy for Muslim countries to limit extremism, poverty and injustice.

Eqbal Ahmad was the founding chancellor of the then newly established Textile Institute of Pakistan, a textile-oriented science, design and business-degree-awarding institute. The institute professes to be driven by the values Eqbal Ahmad stood for and awards its most prestigious honour, the Dr. Eqbal Ahmed Achievement Award, to the graduate who most reflects Eqbal Ahmad&#x27;s values as unanimously chosen by the faculty at its annual convocation.

==Death and legacy==
Eqbal Ahmad died of heart failure on 11 May 1999 at an Islamabad hospital in Pakistan, where he was being treated for colon cancer. He had married Julie Diamond in 1969, a teacher and a writer from New York and they had one daughter, Dohra.

Since his death, a memorial lecture series has been established at Hampshire College in his honour. Speakers have included Kofi Annan, Edward Said, Noam Chomsky, and Arundhati Roy. Ahmad was admired as &quot;an intellectual unintimidated by power or authority&quot;. He collaborated with such left-wing journalists, activists, and thinkers as Chomsky, Said, Howard Zinn, Ibrahim Abu-Lughod, Richard Falk, Fredric Jameson, Alexander Cockburn and Daniel Berrigan. Ahmad influenced several left-leaning activists including Chomsky, Zinn, Abu-Lughod, Richard Falk, Pervez Hoodbhoy, Cockburn, Said and Roy. Ahmad is credited for his insight into Islamic terrorism; he publicly criticised global support for the Islamic fundamentalist groups in Afghanistan.

Noam Chomsky in an article, after Ahmad&#x27;s death in 1999, described Ahmad as a &quot;treasured friend, trusted comrade, counsellor and teacher&quot; and said that Ahmad describes with warmth and feeling the Islamic Sufi tradition that he remembers from his childhood in a village in Bihar, where Islamic Sufi admiration among the public united Hindus and Muslims. Simple and unpretentious, &#x27;they preached by example&#x27;, living &#x27;by service and by setting an example of treating people equally without discrimination&#x27;. The Sufis appealed to the most oppressed, offering &#x27;social mobility, as well as dignity and equality to the poor&#x27;. Sufis regarded the idea of nationalism as an anti-Islamic ideology that &#x27;proceeds to create boundaries where Islam is a faith without national boundaries. Eqbal Ahmad describes himself as a &#x27;harshly secular&#x27; person and an &#x27;internationalist&#x27; but he was quick to praise elements of religious thought and practice that he found admirable among the Islamic Sufis.

Eqbal Ahmad saw Islam as concerned, above all, with the welfare of common people. Eqbal&#x27;s leftism was his humanity and this only reinforced the pride he took in being a Pakistani in a challenging time.

In a review of &quot;The Selected Writings of Eqbal Ahmad&quot;, Keally McBride praises &quot;his uncanny sense of human nature, and his encyclopedic knowledge of world history&quot;. Kabir Babar wrote that &quot;to study him is to be exposed to the rare phenomenon of academic rigour coupled to a will to act.&quot; Shahid Alam of &quot;Monthly Review&quot; wrote that &quot;Ahmad provided the most articulate, analytical, and passionate voice from the third world since Frantz Fanon. Almost certainly, he is also the most astute political thinker the Islamic world produced in the twentieth century.&quot;

He was a left-wing secularist, known for his lifelong denunciation and critiques of Western imperialism. Amitava Kumar argued, &quot;As much as Said, he was a mentor to a generation of thinkers, mostly South Asian [...] notable for &quot;not only the power but also the wide range of his sympathies [...] He was a committed engineer of emancipation, building imaginative roads, linking issues across continents.&quot; He found some aspects of Ahmad&#x27;s analysis less relevant in the 21st century but still praised &quot;his commitment to resolving political problems through diplomacy, not war. His writing on the Muslim world in particular was notable for its critical vigilance and integrity, its resistance to received wisdom.&quot; Irfan Husain wrote in &quot;Dawn&quot; that Ahmad was too biased in favor of the Palestinians in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but also stated, &quot;Perhaps his most precious gift was his ability to listen to others in a way most of us don&#x27;t: he would pay young students the same courtesy of carefully following their argument that he would extend to the rich and powerful.&quot; Muhammad Idrees Ahmad wrote in 2016, &quot;He accurately predicted the consequences of western recklessness in Afghanistan, and his warnings on US intervention in Iraq would prove prophetic.&quot;

<text>Dirk Wears White Sox is the debut studio album by English new wave band Adam and the Ants. It was released on 30 November 1979 by record label Do It. It was the first number one album on the UK Independent Albums Chart when the chart debuted in &quot;Record Week&quot; in 1980.

== Background ==
&quot;Dirk Wears White Sox&quot; was made with an early line-up of Adam and the Ants, which disbanded after the album was released. Guitarist Matthew Ashman and drummer David Barbarossa went on to form Bow Wow Wow with then-Ants bassist Leigh Gorman (who only played one gig with the Ants and was not involved in any studio recordings). Original bassist Andy Warren had departed shortly after recording the album to join former Ants guitarist Lester Square in The Monochrome Set. Many of the songs, notably &quot;Cleopatra&quot; and &quot;Never Trust a Man (With Egg on his Face)&quot;, remained a part of Adam Ant&#x27;s live repertoire throughout his career, both with the Ants and later as a solo artist.

The album title refers to classic British film icon Dirk Bogarde.

==Production==
The album was recorded 12–24 August 1979 at Sound Development Studios, London and mixed 25–29 August. All instrumentation and guide vocals were completed in the first three days. Of the fourteen tracks recorded, three - &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;Kick&quot; and &quot;Physical&quot; - were unfinished at this time, although &quot;Physical&quot; was later issued as the B-side on 2000 copies of the single &quot;Zerox&quot; in July, 1980. The remainder of the sessions were dedicated to recording finished lead and backing vocals for the eleven released tracks.

Five tracks from the album, &quot;Day I Met God&quot;, &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;Catholic Day&quot;, &quot;Never Trust A Man (With Egg On His Face)&quot; and &quot;Family of Noise&quot; - plus the three rejected tracks - had previously been recorded in 1978 for the Ants&#x27; first label Decca Records - &quot;Kick&quot; at RAK Studios in Chalbert Street, London, produced by Snips, the other seven at Decca&#x27;s own studio at Broadhurst Gardens, West Hampstead, produced by Ant himself. Prior to this, all songs on the released album except &quot;Digital Tenderness&quot;, &quot;Nine Plan Failed&quot; and &quot;Cleopatra&quot; were recorded on 4-track by Ant at home in Notting Hill Gate 25–27 July, 1978; &quot;Cleopatra&quot; and &quot;Physical&quot; had been similarly taped by Ant at home in Chelsea, 20 November, 1977.

== Musical style ==
Ant biographer James Maw reports in his 1981 book &quot;The Official Adam Ant Story&quot; that Ant wished to make &quot;a stylish album with all the qualities of soul and funk.&quot; Ant confirmed in a 2014 interview for &quot;Classic Pop&quot; that the album was &quot;me trying to make a Donna Summer record... I know it doesn&#x27;t sound like that, but check out Dave (Barbe)&#x27;s drumming.&quot;

&quot;Mojo&quot;″s Danny Eccleston classifies &quot;Dirk Wears White Sox&quot; as a post-punk album. Chris Woodstra of AllMusic described the album&#x27;s style as a &quot;sometimes-awkward fusion of punk, glam and minimalist post-punk with bizarre images and disturbing tales of alienation, sex and brutality.&quot; Peter Parrish of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Dirk&quot; slips somewhere between The Banshee&#x27;s &quot;Scream&quot; and Gang of Four&#x27;s &quot;Entertainment&quot;; all stark, angular and brittle.&quot;

The album has been cited as an influence on the nascent gothic rock scene. Andi Sex Gang from Sex Gang Children and John Robb referenced the record as part of the British Library&#x27;s Goth: The Scene That Wouldn&#x27;t Die, 2014.

== Releases ==
&quot;Dirk Wears White Sox&quot; was released on 30 November 1979 by Do It Records. The three out-takes were later released in 1982 as the 7 inch EP &quot;The B-Sides&quot; as well as a 12-inch EP &quot;The Antmusic EP&quot; also containing a remix of Cartrouble (Parts 1 &amp; 2).

The album was reissued in 1983, featuring a different album cover taken from a December 1979 video for the song &quot;Zerox&quot;. &quot;Catholic Day&quot; and &quot;Day I Met God&quot; were dropped and &quot;Cartrouble (Parts 1 and 2)&quot; were replaced by &quot;Cartrouble&quot; in its single version and its B-side, a re-recording of &quot;Kick!&quot; which contained completely different lyrics from the rejected album version and featured Jon Moss on drums (who later went on to join Culture Club). This edition also adds two other songs from the same era not on the original LP: both sides of the &quot;Zerox&quot;/ &quot;Whip in My Valise&quot; single.

It was reissued again in 1995 by Sony, featuring the original black-and-white album art in somewhat cropped form and with the dropped songs reinstated as bonus tracks at the end. The lettering on the sleeve was recreated in the style of the original and does not feature the stroke through the letter O in the word &quot;Sox&quot;; it also substitutes a letter &quot;Z&quot; in place of the zig-zagged &quot;S&quot; in the word &quot;Ants&quot; (previously a common practice among unofficial merchandisers around the time of the album&#x27;s original release). Later pressings of the 1995 edition substituted the Antmusic EP remix of &quot;Cartrouble (Parts 1 &amp; 2)&quot; in place of the &quot;Cartrouble&quot; A-side.

The album was remastered and reissued in 2004 with the original track listing restored and the singles/EP material included as bonus tracks.

A white vinyl edition was released by Ant&#x27;s own label Blueblack Hussar Records in spring 2014. To tie in with this, on 19 April, Ant performed the full album at the Hammersmith Apollo with a band including former Ants David Barbarossa and Leigh Gorman, preceding this with several UK tour dates. A launch party gig for the white vinyl album was held at the 100 Club. Both London concerts were filmed and later released as the DVD album &quot;Dirk Live at the Apollo&quot;. Ant would subsequently perform the full album again with his regular band for four nights at the Islington Assembly Hall in November 2014 and a full UK tour in spring 2015.

== Reception ==
During their lifetime, the original Ants were subject to much hostility - even abuse - from the UK music press. An example of this was a highly negative joint review by Paul Morley of both &quot;Dirk&quot; and the upcoming Throbbing Gristle album &quot;20 Jazz Funk Greats&quot;, for the &quot;NME&quot; under the headline &quot;Berks That Lurk In The Corner Of Your Psyche.&quot; Ant remained aggrieved about this review in later years, commenting in a 2010 interview by Simon Price for &quot;The Quietus&quot; that he was upset how Morley &quot;is now being commissioned by Sony to write my liner notes ... Go and write for Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Or go on TV and talk shit for three hours. That represents the old school. He&#x27;s fucked. He&#x27;s got no credibility. Fuck him.&quot; Do It label manager Ian Tregoning likewise denounced Morley&#x27;s review as &quot;garbage - it didn&#x27;t even qualify as garbage.&quot;

Retrospective reviews have generally taken a more concilliatory tone. In his retrospective review of the album for AllMusic, Chris Woodstra wrote that &quot;while the somewhat pretentious, overly arty lyrics and inexperienced playing are a drawback, the album offers a fascinating look at the Ants&#x27; formative years, capturing a raw energy that would be sacrificed for more polish on subsequent releases.&quot; Reviewing its 2004 reissue in &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;, Peter Parrish called the album a &quot;rather marvellous record of jagged jitters&quot; and found that it &quot;sounds a great deal more contemporary than later Ants material.&quot; &quot;Uncut&quot; likewise opined that unlike the band&#x27;s subsequent albums, &quot;Dirk Wears White Sox&quot; &quot;sounds as though it was made last week&quot;. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; was more critical, describing Ant&#x27;s vocals as &quot;dour&quot; and &quot;uncomfortable&quot; and the band as sounding &quot;dead&quot; and &quot;far too slow&quot;, though noting that the 1983 version is &quot;far better&quot; than the 1979 version.

<text>Ecgfrith was king of Mercia from 29 July to December 796. He was the son of Offa, one of the most powerful kings of Mercia, and Cynethryth, his wife. In 787, Ecgfrith was consecrated king, the first known consecration of an English king, probably arranged by Offa in imitation of the consecration of Charlemagne&#x27;s sons by the pope in 781. Around 789, Offa seems to have intended that Ecgfrith marry the Frankish king Charlemagne&#x27;s daughter Bertha, but Charlemagne was outraged by the request and the proposal never went forward.

According to the &quot;Croyland Chronicle&quot; &quot;he (Ecgfrith) was seized with a malady, and departed this life.&quot; His reign lasted 141 days.

Ecgfrith was succeeded by a distant relative, Coenwulf, presumably because Offa had arranged the murder of nearer relatives in order to eliminate dynastic rivals. According to a contemporary letter from Alcuin of York, an English deacon and scholar who spent over a decade at Charlemagne&#x27;s court as one of his chief advisors:
:That most noble young man has not died for his sins, but the vengeance for the blood shed by the father has reached the son. For you know how much blood his father shed to secure the kingdom upon his son.

Alcuin added: &quot;This was not a strengthening of the kingdom, but its ruin.&quot;

<doc id="481988" wikidata="Q688603" url="?curid=481988" title="Engineering technologist">
<text>An engineering technologist is a professional trained in certain aspects of development and implementation of a respective area of technology. An education in engineering technology concentrates more on application and less on theory than does an engineering education. Engineering technologists often assist engineers; but after years of experience, they can also become engineers. Like engineers, areas where engineering technologists can work include product design, fabrication, and testing. Engineering technologists sometimes rise to senior management positions in industry or become entrepreneurs.

Engineering technologists are more likely than engineers to focus on post-development implementation, product manufacturing, or operation of technology. The American National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE) makes the distinction that engineers are trained in conceptual skills, to &quot;function as designers&quot;, while engineering technologists &quot;apply others&#x27; designs&quot;. The mathematics and sciences, as well as other technical courses, in engineering technology programs, are taught with more application-based examples, whereas engineering coursework provides a more theoretical foundation in math and science. Moreover, engineering coursework tends to require higher-level mathematics including calculus and calculus-based theoretical science courses, as well as more extensive knowledge of the natural sciences, which serves to prepare students for research (whether in graduate studies or industrial R&amp;D) as opposed to engineering technology coursework which focuses on algebra, trigonometry, applied calculus, and other courses that are more practical than theoretical in nature and generally have more labs that involve the hands-on application of the topics studied.

In the United States, although some states require, without exception, a BS degree in engineering at schools with programs accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), about two-thirds of the states accept BS degrees in engineering technology accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission (ETAC) of the ABET, in order to become licensed as professional engineers. States have different requirements as to the years of experience needed to take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) and Professional Engineering (PE) exams. A few states require those sitting for the exams to have a master&#x27;s degree in engineering. This education model is in line with the educational system in the United Kingdom where an accredited MEng or MSc degree in engineering is required by the Engineering Council (EngC) to be registered as a Chartered Engineer. Engineering technology graduates with can earn an MS degree in engineering technology, engineering, engineering management, construction management, or a National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB)-accredited Master of Architecture degree. These degrees are also offered online or through distance-learning programs at various universities, both nationally and internationally, which allows individuals to continue working full-time while earning an advanced degree.

== Nature of the work ==
Engineering technologists are more likely to work in testing, fabrication/construction or fieldwork, while engineers generally focus more on conceptual design and product development, with considerable overlap (e.g., testing and fabrication are often integral to the overall product development process and can involve engineers as well as engineering technologists).

Engineering technologists are employed in a wide array of industries and areas including product development, manufacturing and maintenance. They may become managers depending upon the experience and their educational emphasis on management. Entry-level positions relating in various ways to product design, product testing, product development, systems development, field engineering, technical operations, and quality control are common for engineering technologists. Most companies generally make no distinction between engineers and engineering technologists when it comes to hiring.

==Education and accreditation==
Beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, some post-secondary institutions in the U.S. and Canada began offering degrees in engineering technology, focusing on applied study rather than the more theoretical studies required for engineering degrees. The focus on applied study addressed a need within the scientific, manufacturing, and engineering communities, as well as other industries, for professionals with hands-on and applications-based engineering knowledge. Depending on the institution, associate&#x27;s or bachelor&#x27;s degrees are offered, with some institutions also offering advanced degrees in engineering technology.

In general, an engineering technologist receives a broad range of applied science and applied mathematics training, as well as the fundamentals of engineering in the student&#x27;s area of focus. Engineering technology programs typically include instruction in providing support to specific engineering specialties. Information technology is primarily involved with the management, operation, and maintenance of computer systems and networks, along with an application of technology in diverse fields such as architecture, engineering, graphic design, telecommunications, computer science, and network security. An engineering technologist is also expected to have had some coursework in ethics.

In 2001, Professional organizations from different countries have signed a mutual recognition agreement called the Sydney Accord, which represents an understanding that the academic credentials of engineering technologists will be recognized in all signatory states. The recognition given engineering technologists under the Sydney Accord can be compared to the Washington Accord for engineers and the Dublin Accord for engineering technicians. The Engineering Technologist Mobility Forum (ETMF) is an international forum held by signatories of the Sydney Accord to explore mutual recognition for experienced engineering technologists and to remove artificial barriers to the free movement and practice of engineering technologists amongst their countries. ETMF can be compared to the Engineers Mobility Forum (EMF) for engineers.

Graduates acquiring an associate degree, or lower, typically find careers as engineering technicians. According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics: &quot;Many four-year colleges offer bachelor&#x27;s degrees in engineering technology and graduates of these programs are hired to work as entry-level engineers or applied engineers, but not technicians.&quot; Engineering technicians typically have a two-year associate degree, while engineering technologists have a bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, the new occupational category of &quot;technologist&quot; was established in the 1960s, in conjunction with an emerging system of community colleges and technical institutes. It was designed to effectively bridge the gap between the increasingly theoretical nature of engineering degrees and the predominantly practical approach of technician and trades programs. Provincial associations may certify individuals as a professional technologist (P.Tech.), certified engineering technologist (C.E.T.), registered engineering technologist (R.E.T.), applied science technologist (AScT), or technologue professionel (T.P.). These provincial associations are constituent members of Technology Professionals Canada (TPC), which accredits technology programs across Canada, through its Technology Accreditation Canada (TAC). Nationally accredited engineering technology programs range from two to three years in length, depending on the province, and often require as many classroom hours as a 4-year degree program.

===United States===
In the United States, the U.S. Department of Education or the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) are at the top of the educational accreditation hierarchy. The U.S. Department of Education acknowledges regional and national accreditation and CHEA recognizes specialty accreditation. One technology accreditation is currently recognized by CHEA: The Association of Technology, Management and Applied Engineering (ATMAE). CHEA recognizes ATMAE for accrediting associate, baccalaureate, and master&#x27;s degree programs in technology, applied technology, engineering technology, and technology-related disciplines delivered by national or regional accredited institutions in the United States. As of March 2019, ABET withdrew from CHEA recognition

The National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies (NICET) awards certification at two levels, depending on work experience: the Associate Engineering Technologist (AT) and the Certified Engineering Technologist (CT). ATMAE awards two levels of certification in technology management: Certified Technology Manager (CTM) and Certified Senior Technology Manager (CSTM). ATMAE also awards two levels of certification of manufacturing specialist: Certified Manufacturing Specialist (CMS) and Certified Senior Manufacturing Specialist (CSMS). In 2020, ATMAE announced offering the Certified Controls Engineer (CCE) and Certified Senior Controls Engineer (CSCE) professional certifications. While the CTM, CMS, and CCE certifications are obtained through examination, the CSTM, CSMS and CSCE require industry experience and continuous improvement via the obtainment of professional development units (PDUs).

The American Society of Certified Engineering Technicians (ASCET) is a membership organization that issues Certified Member certifications to engineering technicians and engineering technologists. Professional engineers are issued Registered Member certification.

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom has a decades-long tradition of producing engineering technologists via the apprenticeship system. UK engineering technologists have always been designated as &quot;engineers&quot;, which in the UK is used to describe the entire range of skilled workers and professionals, from tradespeople through to the highly educated Chartered Engineer. In fact up until the 1960s professional engineers in the UK were often referred to as &quot;Technologists&quot; to distinguish them from scientists, technicians, and craftsmen. The modern term for an engineering technologist is &quot;incorporated engineer&quot; (IEng), although since 2000 the normal route to achieving IEng is with a bachelor&#x27;s or honors degree in engineering. Modern technical apprenticeships would normally lead to the engineering technician (EngTech) professional qualification and, with further studies at higher apprenticeship level, an IEng. Since 2015, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) has introduced engineering degree (bachelors and masters) apprenticeships. The title &quot;incorporated engineer&quot; is protected by civil law. Prior to the title &quot;incorporated engineer&quot;, UK technologists were known as &quot;technician engineers&quot; a designation introduced in the 1960s.

In the United Kingdom, an incorporated engineer is accepted as a &quot;professional engineer&quot;, registered by the EngC, although the term &quot;professional engineer&quot; has no legal meaning in the UK and there are no restrictions on the practice. In fact, anyone in the UK can call themselves an &quot;engineer&quot; or &quot;professional engineer&quot; without any qualifications or proven competence in engineering; and most UK skilled trades are sometimes referred to as &quot;professional&quot; or &quot;accredited&quot; engineers. Examples are &quot;Registered Gas Engineer&quot; (gas installer) or &quot;Professional Telephone Engineer&quot; (phone line installer or fault diagnosis).

Incorporated engineers are recognized internationally under the Sydney Accord as engineering technologists. One of the professional titles recognized by the Washington Accord for engineers in the United Kingdom is the chartered engineer. The incorporated engineer is a professional engineer as recognized by the EngC of the United Kingdom. The European designation, as demonstrated by the prescribed title under 2005/36/EC, is &quot;engineer&quot;. The incorporated engineer operates autonomously and directs activities independently. They do not necessarily need the support of chartered engineers, because they are often acknowledged as full engineers in the UK (but not in Canada or the U.S.). The United Kingdom incorporated engineer may also contribute to the design of new products and systems.

The chartered engineer and incorporated engineer, whilst often undertaking similar roles, are distinct qualifications awarded by the EngC, with Chartered Engineer (CEng) status being the terminal engineering qualification.

Incorporated engineers currently require an IEng-accredited bachelors or honors degree in engineering (prior to 1997 the B.Sc. and B.Eng. degrees satisfied the academic requirements for &quot;chartered engineer&quot; registration), a Higher National Certificate or diploma, City and Guilds of London Institute higher diploma/full technological cert diploma, or a Foundation Degree in engineering, plus appropriate further learning to degree level, or an NVQ4 or SVQ4 qualifications approved for the purpose by a licensed engineering institution.

The academic requirements must be accompanied by the appropriate peer-reviewed experience in employment—typically 4 years post qualification. In addition to the experience and academic requirements, the engineering candidate must have three referees (themselves CEng or IEng) who vouch for the performance of the individual being considered for professional recognition. There are a number of alternative ways to achieve IEng status for those that do not have the necessary qualifications for applicants, but who can clearly show they have achieved the same level as those with qualifications, including:

* writing a technical report, based upon their experience and demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of engineering principles;
* earning the City and Guilds graduate diploma (bachelors level) and a postgraduate diploma (masters level) accredited by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE), Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) and Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE);
* following a work-based learning program;
* or taking an academic program specified by the institution to which they are applying.

===Germany – European Union===

====Engineering technologist / state-certified engineer====
The engineering technologist (state-certified technician; ) are vocational (non-academic) qualifications at the tertiary level in Germany. The degree is governed by the framework agreement of trade and technical schools (resolution of the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the states in the Federal Republic of Germany of 7 November 2002 in its respective applicable version) and is recognised by all states of the Federal Republic of Germany. It is awarded after passing state examinations at state or state-recognised technical school or academies (). Through the Vocational Training Modernisation Act (12.12.2019), state-certified engineers are also allowed to hold the title &quot;Bachelor Professional in Technik&quot; as of 1 January 2020.

To be eligible for the engineering technologist examination, candidates must fulfill the following requirements: completion of one of the school systems (Hauptschule, Realschule, Gymnasium), an apprenticeship of at least two years duration, one year of completed professional work experience and attendance of an educational program with a course load of 2400–3000 hours, usually completed within two years, full-time, or 3.5–4 years, part-time, at vocational colleges.

====State-certified technicians/engineers in the EU directives====
As of 31 January 2012, state-certified engineers, state-certified business managers and state-certified designers are at level 6-bachelor in the European Qualifications Framework (EQF), equivalent to a bachelor&#x27;s degree. As such, the engineering technologist constitutes an advanced entry qualification for German universities and in principle permits entry into any undergraduate academic-degree program.

The qualifications are listed in EU Directives as recognised, regulated professions in Germany and the EU. Annexes C and D were added to Council Directive 92/51/EEC as a second general system for the recognition of professional education and training to supplement Directive 89/48/EEC.

Institutions involved included the federal government (in Germany, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology), EU Standing Conference and Economic Ministerial Meeting of Countries, the German Chamber of Crafts, the Confederation of German Employers&#x27; Associations, German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, Confederation of German Trade Unions, and the Federal Institute for Vocational Application. These government institutions agreed on a common position regarding the implementation of the EQF and a German qualifications framework (DQR).

European Union law and other documents considered to be public include:

* Annexes C and D to Council Directive 92/51/EEC on a second general system for the recognition of professional education and training to supplement Directive 89/48/EEC
* EU Directive 2005L0036-EN 01.01.2007
* ANNEX III list of regulated education and training referred to in the third subparagraph of Article 13(2)

<text>LeConte&#x27;s sparrow (Ammospiza leconteii), also known as &quot;LeConte&#x27;s bunting&quot;, is one of the smallest New World sparrow species in North America.

==Description==
LeConte&#x27;s sparrow is a small sparrow with a relatively large head, short grey bill and short pointed tail. It has a buffy yellow-orange face with grey cheeks, and a dark brown crown with a white central stripe. The nape of the neck is lilac grey with chestnut streaks, and the back is streaked with brown and beige. Its belly is off white, while the breast and sides are a buffy orange-yellow with dark brown streaks. The feet and legs are a brownish-pink colour.

=== Measurements ===
The measurements for both sexes are:
* Length: 4.7 in/ 12 cm
* Wingspan: 7.1 in/18 cm
* Weight: 0.4–0.6 oz/ 12–16 g

=== Similar birds ===
LeConte&#x27;s sparrow is commonly mistaken for other small sparrows, such as the Nelson&#x27;s sparrow (&quot;Ammospiza nelsoni&quot;), grasshopper sparrow (&quot;Ammodramus savannarum&quot;), Henslow&#x27;s sparrow (&quot;Centronyx henslowii&quot;), saltmarsh sparrow (&quot;Ammospiza caudacuta&quot;), and Baird&#x27;s sparrow. (&quot;C. bairdii&quot;).

==Taxonomy==
LeConte&#x27;s sparrow is a member of the order Passerifomes, which are the perching birds, sometimes less accurately referred to as the songbirds. It is from the family Passerellidae, which is characterized by species of small birds with bills adapted to seed eating. LeConte&#x27;s sparrow was placed in the genus &quot;Ammodramus&quot; in the past and a molecular phylogeny of the related groups identified that genus as being polyphyletic and recommended the group to be split up. This species falls within the genus &quot;Ammospiza&quot; clade which includes &quot;A. maritimus&quot;, &quot;A. nelsoni&quot;, and &quot;A. caudacutus&quot;, which are the ground-loving sparrows that prefer staying in tall, thick grasses to perching on trees. There has been a recorded case of a LeConte&#x27;s sparrow that hybridized with a Nelson&#x27;s sparrow, in June 1949 in Ontario, Canada.

LeConte&#x27;s sparrow was first described by John Latham in 1790 but only received a valid binomial name from John James Audubon in 1844. He wrote, &quot;I have named this interesting species after my young friend Doctor Le Conte, son of Major Le Conte, so well known among naturalists, and who is, like his father, much attached to the study of natural history.&quot; It is generally believed that he meant John Lawrence LeConte (whose father had been an Army surveyor with the rank of major), although some feel that he was referring to another John LeConte, also a doctor, and John Lawrence&#x27;s cousin.

== Habitat and distribution ==

===Range===
LeConte&#x27;s sparrow breeds in select areas of Canada, such as northeastern British Columbia, across Alberta, Saskatchewan and southern Manitoba as well as central Ontario and into Quebec; and as far south as northern Michigan, Montana and Minnesota. It winters in the southeastern United States; as far west as central Texas and as far north as central Illinois and Missouri.
===Habitat===
LeConte&#x27;s sparrow prefers moist open grassy areas with sufficient vegetation cover to provide shelter. Known habitat use includes meadows, fields, crop stubble, shallow marshy edges, prairie, and occasionally fens and lake-shores within the boreal forest. Studies have shown that vegetation seems to have a greater impact on the abundance of this bird than other factors like climate or patch size. Winter &quot;et al.&quot; (2005) says that it can be found at highest densities in areas with a &quot;moderate amounts of bare ground&quot;. Agriculture and drainage of these areas is currently the greatest threat to LeConte&#x27;s sparrow.

==Behaviour==
It is a very secretive bird that prefers to spend most of its time on the ground under the cover of tall grasses. They are typically very difficult to flush, often only flushing at a distance of 1–3 m as they prefer to run across the ground. When they do emerge they rarely fly more than a foot or two above the grass and often descend again within a few meters. Because it is so rarely seen, there are still many gaps in knowledge about LeConte&#x27;s sparrow. Nests are often very hard to find, and individuals are more often identified by sound than by sight. For example, one survey of LeConte&#x27;s sparrows identified 86 males by sound, but only 8 of those males by sight. For the same reason, very few LeConte&#x27;s have ever been banded. Between 1967 and 1984, only 355 were actually banded, and none were ever re-captured.

===Vocalizations===
The male&#x27;s song resembles a grasshopper buzz with a short squeaky introductory note and ending with a short chirp. It is often described as &quot;tika-zzzzzzzzzzzz-tik&quot; while the call is a short &quot;tsip&quot;. It is most commonly confused with the song of the Nelson&#x27;s sparrow. The male generally sings from a concealed location, but can also be seen singing from the top of protruding grass stems, or occasionally in flight.

===Diet===
Their diet in the summer is mostly insects such as weevils, leafhoppers, leaf beetles, stinkbugs, caterpillars, moths and spiders. During the winter time the main diet consists of seeds of grasses and weeds such as northern dropseed, Indian grass, yellow foxtail, panic-grass, scorpion-grass, little bluestem, and big bluestem.

===Reproduction===
Mating can start as early as late April but peaks in mid-May. Males will sing from the cover of dense grasses, perched on tall grass or in flight. Clutches range from two to six eggs with four being the most common. Incubation is done solely by the female, though both parents aid in feeding. Incubation lasts an average of 11–13 days. Hatchlings are altricial with dull brown downy patches. Pairs will have one or two broods per year. Due to the secretive nature of this bird little is known about the period of time between hatching and fledging.

====Nest====
Nests are built by the female and are cup shaped, made from fine grasses and lined with soft grass and hair. They are usually attached to standing grasses or sedges and are built on or close to the ground. Their nests are often parasitized by brown-headed cowbirds (&quot;Molothrus ater&quot;).

====Eggs====
Eggs are 18 X 14 mm long and are sub elliptical in shape. Eggs are white with undertones of green, grey or blue; covered in fine brown dots, speckles or splotches usually clustered near large end of egg.

<text>Lesley Presley Pretend is a fictional character in a comic strip (Les Pretend) in the UK comic &quot;The Beano&quot; with the byline &quot;the Little kid with the big imagination&quot;. Originally drawn by John Sherwood, he first appeared in issue 2493, dated 28 April 1990. In each issue, Les pretends to be something and dresses up like it, beginning with a martian in his debut. His dad is called Des (and is thus one of the few Beano parents to be given a name rather than &#x27;mum&#x27; or &#x27;dad&#x27;), an Elvis Presley fan and impersonator, hence Les&#x27; middle name of Presley. Recurring features of the strip are the feasibility of Les&#x27; (often improvised) costumes, and the readiness with which Des accepts things like the appearance of a giant creature, and attempts to deal with it in a rational and unfazed way.

Sherwood continued to draw the strip until his death in late 2003. The strip then disappeared from &quot;The Beano&quot; for a short while, as it was originally planned to retire the character. Eventually, though, it returned to the comic drawn by Trevor Metcalfe, who drew it for about a year between 2004 and 2005, though Steve Bright also drew a few episodes in early 2004. The strip again disappeared before returning a couple of years later, this time drawn by Laura Howell. This was a one off, and showed Les beating a real Dalek in a Dalek fancy dress competition, and appeared in Beano issue 3402 dated 13 October 2007 . A Johnny Bean from Happy Bunny Green strip by the same artist followed this up with everyone dressed as vegetables in another fancy dress competition. Les wasn&#x27;t seen again for nearly a year after that strip until the comic started to run reprints of John Sherwood strips from the 1990s. Laura Howell also drew Les&#x27;s strip for the 2010 and 2011 Beano Annuals. Sometime shortly before Mike Stirling became editor, Les Pretend was dropped.

Les Pretend returned to The Beano in the Funsize Funnies in #3660 drawn by Laura Howell once again.
Les also appeared back into the Beano 2016 annual twice, drawn by Laura Howell. he dresses up as his mum and orders pizza, then Des starts to prefer Les for a mum than the actual mum so Les&#x27; mum dresses up as Les. Les also dresses up as a cat, which his Dad uses on his Elvis Presley website to attract more people.

<text>Tin-Can Tommy (The Clockwork Boy) was a comic strip in the UK comic &quot;The Beano&quot;, featuring Tommy, the clockwork &#x27;son&#x27; of Professor Lee and his wife. It first appeared on the back page of issue 1, dated 30 July 1938, where we learn that it was built due to the death of their own son a year earlier (a concept which predates &quot;Astro Boy&quot;).

A few years later came the addition of a clockwork sister called Babe, a pet cat called Clanky, and a horse called Ironsides. The strip was created by the Italian Dinelli brothers, but they disappeared in France at the start of World War II. The strip was taken over by one of DC Thomson&#x27;s own artists after issue 69 with new strips being drawn by Sam Fair, Charles Gordon and George Drysdale. The strip continued until issue No 303 in 1947.

In issue 3185 (dated August 2003) Tin Can Tommy met Bea, Dennis the Menace&#x27;s baby sister for the comic&#x27;s 65th anniversary.

<text>The Battle of Haifa, also known as the Fall of Haifa, and called by the Jewish forces Operation Bi&#x27;ur Hametz ( &quot;Passover Cleansing&quot;), was a Haganah operation carried out on 21–22 April 1948 and a major event in the final stages of the civil war in Palestine, leading up to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The objective of the operation was the capture of the Arab neighborhoods of Haifa. The operation formed part of the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight, with approximately 15,000 Arab residents being displaced between April 21–22, and with only 4,000 remaining in the city by mid-May from a pre-conflict population of approximately 65,000.

== Background ==
Before the war, Haifa was a mixed city with a population of 135,000, split between Jews (70,000) and Palestinian Arabs (65,000). The two populations were largely separate, with the main Jewish areas of the city being Hadar HaCarmel, Bat Galim, and Neve Sha&#x27;anan, while Halisa, Wadi Salib, Wadi Nisnas, Kfur Samir, and Wadi al-Jimal were predominantly Arab.

A significant port city situated on the Mediterranean coast, Haifa was a strategic location in Palestine. Having been allocated to a Jewish state under the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, the leadership of the Yishuv considered it of vital importance. With the capture of the port of Haifa it would be possible for the Haganah to receive supplies and armaments.

With the outbreak of the 1947-1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine, Haifa&#x27;s Arab population was subject to acts of terrorism by the Irgun and Haganah, and many Palestinians began to flee the city. By mid March, 25,000 to 30,000 Palestinian Arabs had already evacuated from Haifa.

The implementation of Plan Dalet in Haganah&#x27;s April offensive — including Operation Nachshon to open the Tel-Aviv-Jerusalem road, and Operation Yiftah to control eastern Galilee — appeared to take the Arab Higher Committee (AHC) by surprise. The Palestinian Arab half of Haifa was remote from other major Palestinian Arab centres and contact had been cut off by the Jewish villages along the approach roads to Haifa. Businesses and workshops had closed with no prospect of continued employment. Unemployment was rife and the cost of food had escalated.

==Preparations and hostilities in March-April 1948==
On 17March 1948 Mohammad bin Hammad Al Huneiti, commander of the town&#x27;s Arab militia, was killed in an ambush of a convoy bringing 15 tons of arms and explosives. His death left his followers demoralised. According to Jon Kimche the Haganah had a highly placed informer and were able to intercept nine of eleven Palestinian Arab arms convoys into Haifa. The Arab garrison of the Palestinian Arab areas of the city was commanded by Captain Amin Izz al-Din who had been appointed by the Arab Liberation Army&#x27;s (ALA) military committee on 27March in Damascus. Through the next month his original force of 450 was depleted by desertion until it was no longer a fighting force. Izz al-Din organised several operations against the Jewish community, including detonating a truck-load of explosives near the flour mills. The fighting in the city intensified with exchanges of fire and mortar attacks in the downtown and Hadar.

The British had previously controlled the city and maintained a buffer between the Jewish and Arab populations. In preparation for the total evacuation of all British forces from the mandate, the British began an evacuation of troops through the port of Haifa in early April. A volunteer police force had been established in preparation of handing over to the United Nations Palestine Commission as the provisional Government of Palestine. The original British Government intentions had been to evacuate Palestine gradually from south to north of Palestine, using Haifa as the embarkation port, to be completed by mid May. On 18 April 1948, Major-General Hugh Stockwell, British Commanding Officer, Northern sector, Haifa, summoned a representative of the Jewish Agency to his headquarters. Stockwell relayed his intention to withdraw the British forces from the borders and no-man&#x27;s-land zones in Haifa and that the evacuation would be completed by 20 April. The Haganah saw this change of plan as an opportunity and quickly prepared a 3-pronged attack on the Arab neighborhoods of Wadi Nisnas, Wadi Salib and Khalisa.

The sudden British deployment caused the Carmeli commanders to re-work the details of the operation (previously a plan called Operation Misparayim or Operation Scissors). The revised plan was named &quot;Mivtza Bi&#x27;ur Hametz&quot; (Operation Passover Cleaning).

==Battle==

The Haganah&#x27;s force consisted of 5 companies from the Field Corps, one Palmach company, and a contingent of the Guard Corps. The Jewish forces attacked Wadi Salib and Wadi Nisnas from Hadar HaCarmel, while the bulk of the attack on Khalisa came from Neve Sha&#x27;anan. The Arab headquarters were in the center of the city, near the port and the railway depot.

Commenting on the use of &#x27;psychological warfare broadcasts&#x27; and military tactics in Haifa, Benny Morris wrote:

Throughout the Haganah made effective use of Arabic language broadcasts and loudspeaker vans. Haganah Radio announced that &#x27;the day of judgement had arrived&#x27; and called on inhabitants to &#x27;kick out the foreign criminals&#x27; and to &#x27;move away from every house and street, from every neighbourhood occupied by foreign criminals&#x27;. The Haganah broadcasts called on the populace to &#x27;evacuate the women, the children and the old immediately, and send them to a safe haven&#x27;... Jewish tactics in the battle were designed to stun and quickly overpower opposition; demoralisation was a primary aim. It was deemed just as important to the outcome as the physical destruction of the Arab units. The mortar barrages and the psychological warfare broadcasts and announcements, and the tactics employed by the infantry companies, advancing from house to house, were all geared to this goal. The orders of Carmeli&#x27;s 22nd Battalion were &#x27;to kill every [adult male] Arab encountered&#x27; and to set alight with fire-bombs &#x27;all objectives that can be set alight. I am sending you posters in Arabic; disperse on route&#x27;.

Jon Kimche also describes the &quot;psychological blitz on Arab quarters&quot; until &quot;the Arab nerve broke and the flight from the town assumed panic proportions&quot;.

The first attack was on the Rushmiyya Bridge area cutting the Arab areas off. Prior to the main thrust from the higher ground of the Jewish neighbourhood, Hadar HaCarmel, the Arab Muslim neighborhood of Khalisa came under mortar bombardment. The 3,500–5,000 Arab irregulars could not mount a real defense. The following day the Arab National Committee of Haifa were prepared to ask for a truce via Stockwell. Stockwell agreed to meet with the Israelis, and returned 15 minutes later. However, the terms proposed by the Haganah – complete disarmament, surrender of weapons, and a curfew – were not accepted by the Arab leadership.

After the release of prisoners from Haifa lock-up, the Arab legion took over the building. By 10:15 Arab casualties had been admitted to the Amin Hospital. Hospital staff and casualties were then evacuated to the Government Hospital in the city. Towards midday the fighting slackened. The Jews had complete control of the Khamra square and Stanton Street and were firing from positions in the Suq (market) area. They had also appeared in strength in the eastern quarter of the town from Wadi Husimiyah Bridge to Tel Amal. Arab women, children and others were still being evacuated from the Suq area through the port of Haifa and other safe areas. Arabs were by this time suing for a truce and the Jews replied that they were prepared to consider it if the Arabs stopped shooting. At 17:00 general Arab resistance had ceased in the eastern area with the exception of a few isolated spots and the Jews were in possession of the Suq as far as the eastern gate. In the Wadi Nisnas area the battle was still going on. Arab casualties in this area are believed to have been considerable. At 18:00 the Arab leaders met to consider the terms laid down at a joint meeting of Arab and Jews.

On April 22 a meeting was held in the town hall to discuss terms of the truce. The Haifa Arab Emergency Committee stated that &quot;that they were not in a position to sign a truce, as they had no control over the Arab military elements in the town and that . . . they could not fulfill the terms of the truce, even if they were to sign&quot; adding &quot;that the Arab population wished to evacuate Haifa . . . man, woman and child.&quot; By 22April 1948, the British were only in control of the Haifa port area. The rest of the city was in the hands of the Carmeli Brigade of the Haganah, commanded by Moshe Carmel.

Arab neighborhoods were attacked with mortars and gunfire. Rashid al-Haj Ibrahim, a Palestinian Arab municipal leader, described attacks as “provoking terror among the women and children, who were very influenced by .” He described the flight of Haifa&#x27;s Arab residents thus:

Historian Benny Morris asserts that the initial order to evacuate came from local Arab leadership, and that the Arab Higher Committee endorsed it &quot;ex post facto&quot;. Among the evidence he cites are British and American intelligence reports, and an assessment by the British High Commissioner of Palestine. Possible reasons given by Morris include clearing the way for the Jordanian Arab Legion&#x27;s impending entry into the war and avoiding the population being used as hostages.

This is disputed by historian Walid Khalidi who writes that &quot;the Zionist/Israeli claim that the exodus of Haifa’s civilian population was [...] in response to specific orders to that effect from the Palestinian leadership, is entirely without foundation.&quot; He described &quot;the mass exodus of Haifa&#x27;s Arab population&quot; as &quot;the spontaneous reaction to the ruthless combination of terror and psychological warfare tactics adopted by the Haganah during the attack.&quot;

Approximately 15,000 Arabs fled Haifa during April 21–22. The number of Arab casualties is unknown, with Jon Kimche estimating ~300 killed.

==Aftermath==

On 23April Moshe Carmel declared Martial Law in the town. On the same day units from the Irgun moved into parts of downtown Haifa. Two days later the Haganah forced them to withdraw in a confrontation that resulted in some Irgun casualties.

After the fall of the city there was widespread looting by Zionist forces in Arab areas. Moshe Dayan was appointed to administer abandoned Arab property in the city. He instituted a policy of collecting anything the army could use and storing it in warehouses, with the rest distributed among Jewish agricultural settlements. Golda Meir, who was consulted, agreed with this policy.

After April 22, there were some 30–45,000 Arabs remaining in Haifa, from the pre conflict population estimate of 65,000-70,000. By mid-May there were only ~4,000. The displacement of Palestinians from Haifa formed a significant part of the larger 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight.

Historian Saleh Abdel Jawad writes that &quot;After the fall of Haifa, the Haganah continued to bombard civilian gatherings, especially near the port.&quot; He also relates that on 27 April, seven Palestinians accused of involvement in the Haifa Oil Refinery massacre were executed by the Haganah.

In July the remaining Palestinians were displaced from their homes and concentrated primarily in the Wadi Nisnas neighbourhood in a process of ghettoization.

A systematic destruction of what had been Arab housing was implemented in certain areas by Haifa&#x27;s Technical and Urban Development departments in cooperation with the IDF&#x27;s city commander Ya&#x27;akov Lublini.

<text>Pansy Potter is a British comic strip character from the magazine &quot;The Beano&quot;. She first appeared in &quot;Pansy Potter the Strong Man&#x27;s Daughter&quot; issue 21 in 1938, and was first illustrated by Hugh McNeill.

== Character background ==

As &quot;The Beano&quot; was in its early stages of development, its creator R. D. Low published a newspaper advert in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; asking for freelance artists to submit ideas for DC Thomson&#x27;s new children&#x27;s magazines. One was Manchester-born Hugh McNeill, who would illustrate &quot;Puffing Billy&quot; and &quot;Ping the Elastic Man&quot;. DC Thomson&#x27;s collaborating process developed a comic strip about a strong girl named Bella under the title of &quot;Biff Bang Bella&quot;, but would be changed shortly before the official strip was finalised.

== Synopsis ==
Pansy Potter is the daughter of a strong man, and she has dark, spiky hair and wears a short-sleeved, collared dress. Her stories were comedic with the punchlines being about the casual use of her superhuman strength shocking everyone around her.

== Publication history ==
=== Original run (1938-1947)===
Potter debuted in &quot;Pansy Potter the Strong Man&#x27;s Daughter&quot; in issue 21. McNeill illustrated her stories until he had to abandon his career to draw maps in the Second World War. &quot;Hairy Dan&quot; creator Basil Blackaller continued the series until sometime in 1944 and was succeeded by Sam Fair for three years. Fair&#x27;s final story appeared in issue 325. 

===&quot;In Wonderland&quot; era (1949-1955) ===
In 1949, Potter starred in a new funny strip that became a full-page spread on the back cover: &quot;Pansy Potter in Wonderland&quot;. In the strip, Potter accidentally walks into Wonderland through a wishing well and meets characters from nursery rhymes. &quot;The Beano&quot; celebrated its run by making it the first series on the back cover to be in colour. From issue 369, &quot;Pansy Potter in Wonderland&quot; had over 200 stories designed by James Clark. When Potter returned home, Clark continued creating her stories until the new &quot;Pansy Potter&quot; series ended in issue 652.

===Third Run (1958)===
Charles Grigg and Gordon Bell alternated between the revival over 3 years later in its 42-strip 1958 run.

==== &quot;Sparky&quot; appearances====
In the 1960s and 1970s Pansy Potter starred in her own comic strip in DC Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Sparky&quot; magazine. There were two series between issues 2 to 24, and 80 to 567. She would also appear in four of &quot;Sparky&quot; annuals.

===1989–1993 &quot;Beano&quot; revival===
Pansy Potter returned to &quot;The Beano&quot; in issue 2474 in 1989 this time drawn by Barry Glennard. This series continued until issue 2640 in 1993.

==== &quot;Funsize Funnies&quot; ====
Potter returned to &quot;The Beano&quot; in 2013 between issues 3666 and 3674 in the &quot;Funsize Funnies&quot; section, drawn by Nigel Parkinson. She returned for a second run later on, where she was drawn and written by Kev F. Sutherland. She cameos in &quot;Beano&quot; 2013 and 2019 annuals, as well as in the magazine&#x27;s 80th anniversary crossover.

<text>Shediac (official in both languages; &quot;Shédiac&quot; is colloquial French) is a town in Westmorland County, New Brunswick known as the &quot;Lobster Capital of the World&quot;. It hosts an annual festival every July which promotes its ties to lobster fishing. At the western entrance to the town is a 90-ton sculpture called &quot;The World&#x27;s Largest Lobster&quot;. It is believed that chiac, a well-known Acadian French patois, was named after Shediac.

Since its founding it has expanded several times, most recently in 2023, when it annexed all or part of four local service districts. Revised census figures have not been released.

==Etymology==
Shediac was originally called La Batture. Its name was later changed to Shediac in reference to its position at the basin of the Shediac River. The name &quot;Shediac&quot; itself is derived from the Micmac word &quot;Esedeiik&quot;, which means &quot;which comes from far away&quot;, possibly in reference to the Shediac Bay or the current of the Petitcodiac river.

==Geography==
Shediac is situated primarily on Route 133 around Shediac Bay, a sub-basin of the Northumberland Strait.

Its topography is relatively flat and its soil is mostly composed of sedimentary rocks dating from the Pennsylvanian. Shediac enjoys a continental climate.

The town is located southwest and adjacent to the community of Pointe-du-Chêne, once the eastern terminus of the European and North American Railway as well as a stopover for Pan-Am&#x27;s transatlantic &quot;clipper&quot; air service featuring large seaplanes. Imperial Airways&#x27; flying boat service to Foynes in Ireland also used the facilities.

==History==

Hundreds of years ago, the Mi&#x27;kmaq encampment of &quot;Es-ed-ei-ik&quot; was one of the major camps in southeast New Brunswick. The Mi&#x27;kmaq word , which means &quot;running far in&quot;, in reference to its position where the coastline turns between running north-south and east-west, eventually transformed into &quot;Gédaique&quot;.
Acadians first arrived at Shediac in 1751 as a result of the Acadian Exodus from peninsular Nova Scotia. During the French and Indian War, French officer Charles Deschamps de Boishebert made his headquarters at both Shediac and Cocagne, New Brunswick. In the autumn of 1755, Boishebert established himself on the south shore of Cocagne Bay, a place known as Boishebert&#x27;s Camp. The following year, Boishebert moved to Miramichi, New Brunswick, specifically to Beaubears Island. After the war, Acadians returned to the region in 1767.

Today many francophones use the spelling ; however, the town&#x27;s name upon its incorporation did not feature an accented &quot;e&quot;, and correspondingly the official geographic name for the community is &quot;Shediac&quot;.

==Shediac Bay Yacht Club==
Shediac Bay Yacht Club is on the Register of &#x27;Canada&#x27;s Historic Places&#x27; for being the location of a local wharf for nearly a century. The previous Shediac Bay Yacht Club House was designed by Roméo Savoie.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Shediac had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="482032" wikidata="Q2164" url="?curid=482032" title="Nenets Autonomous Okrug">
<text>The Nenets Autonomous Okrug (; ) also known as Nenetsia () is a federal subject of Russia and an autonomous okrug of Arkhangelsk Oblast. Its administrative center is the town of Naryan-Mar. It has an area of and a population of 42,090 as of the 2010 Census, making it the least populous federal subject.

A plan to merge the autonomous okrug with Arkhangelsk Oblast was presented by the governors of both federal subjects on 13 May 2020, with a referendum planned for September, but was met with opposition by locals,
leading to the merger process being scrapped completely.

==Geography==
The arctic ecology of this area has a number of unique features derived from the extreme temperatures and unique geologic province. Polar bears are found in this locale; in fact, the sub-population found here is a genetically distinct taxon associated with the Barents Sea region. The autonomous okrug has a size of approximately 177,000 km2, more than four times the size of Switzerland or around the same size as the U.S. state of Missouri. The district is around 320 km from north to south and around 950 km from east to west, stretching from Mys Bolvansky Nos in the north to the source of the Oma River in the south and Cape Kanin Nos in the west to the banks of the Kara River in the east.

The okrug has a number of peninsulas – from west to east these are: Kanin peninsula, Svyatoy Nos peninsula, Russkiy Zavorot peninsula and the Yugorsky Peninsula. There are a number of islands off the Nenets coast – from west to east the most important are Kolguyev Island, Sengeyskiy Island, Dolgiy Island, the Gulyayevskiye Koshki Islands, Lovetskiy Island, Pesyakov Island, Dolgy Island, Bolshoy Zelenets Island, Vaygach Island, Oleniy Island and Mestnyy Island. Of these, Kolguyev and Vaygach are by far the largest, being the 119th and 156th largest islands in the world.

==Administrative divisions==
The okrug is administratively divided into one district (Zapolyarny District) and one town of okrug significance (Naryan-Mar). The district is further divided into &quot;selsoviets&quot;. Municipally, the town of Naryan-Mar is incorporated as Naryan-Mar Urban Okrug, while the district (including the settlement of Kharuta, which geographically is an exclave surrounded by the territory of the Komi Republic) is incorporated as Zapolyarny Municipal District.

==Politics==
===Deputies in the State Duma===
* Artur Chilingarov – Deputy of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of Russia of the I, II, III, IV, and V convocations (from 1993 to 2011) in the Nenets single-mandate constituency No. 218.
* Vladimir Pekhtin – Deputy of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of Russia of the VI convocation (from 2011 to 2013), elected on the regional list of the United Russia party. On 20 February 2013, Pekhtin voluntarily resigned as a deputy of the State Duma in connection with allegations of concealing income and real estate.
* Elena Vtorygina – Deputy of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of Russia of the VI convocation (since April 3, 2013). Elected on the regional list of the United Russia party.
* Irina Chirkova – Deputy of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of Russia of the VI convocation (in 2011 she was elected on the regional list of Liberal Democratic Party of Russia.
* Sergey Kotkin – Deputy of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of Russia of the VII convocation in the Nenets single-mandate constituency No. 221.

==History==

===Early history===
The first recorded mention of the Nenets people is found in the 11th-century Primary Chronicle, a chronicle of Kievan Rus&#x27; from about 850 to 1110, originally compiled in Kiev about 1113 by Nestor the Chronicler. At the time, Kievan Rus was under the influence of Novgorod, as was the whole of the North Eastern territories of Kievan Rus&#x27;. By the end of the fifteenth century, Novgorod&#x27;s influence was waning and the area fell under the control of Muscovy and in 1499, they established, Pustozyorsk (, literally meaning &quot;deserted lakes&quot;), and it became a military, commercial, cultural and administrative hub for the area.

By the 18th century, the area was part of Mezensky Uyezd. In 1891, Pechorsky Uyezd was established and in 1896, so was Neskaya Volost. Prior to the formation of the autonomous okrug, this area belonged in part to Mezensky Uyezd in Arkhangelsk Oblast and partly to Izhmo-Pechorsky Uyezd in Komi (Zyriansky) Oblast.

===Soviet history===
The area now known as Nenets Autonomous Okrug was officially created on July 15, 1929, and at that time included Kanino-Timansky District, Peshsky and Omsky Selsoviets, Mezenskaya Volost and Mezensky Uyezd, Telvisochno-Samoyedsky District, Pechorsky Uyezd, and Izhmo-Pechorsky Uyezd of Komi-Zyryan Autonomous Oblast. At this time, two administrative districts, Canino-Timansky and Bolshezemelsky were founded. In December 1929, further additions were made to the District&#x27;s area, namely Pustozyorskaya Volost, Pechora District and a number of offshore islands. In 1934, a number of islands, including Vaygach Island were subsumed into the district. Naryan-Mar was elevated to town status in 1935. In July 1940, a third administrative district was formed, Amderminsky, with its administrative headquarters in Amderma. However, on November 23, 1959, all administrative districts were abolished and a number of areas, including the administrative area for Vorkuta, were transferred to the jurisdiction of the Komi Republic and the region took the shape that it still holds today.

===Recent history===
Zapolyarny Municipal District, one of the youngest districts in Russia, was formed in 2006. Zapolyarny translates as &quot;beyond the polar [circle]&quot;, and the district was given this name because the vast majority of the district&#x27;s area lies north of the arctic circle.

The economy of Zapolyarny district is dominated by oil and gas, constituting around 99% of all industrial activity within the whole Okrug. In 2021, 99.9% of all exports from the Okrug were of crude petroleum, with the remaining 0.01% comprising fresh fish. The dominance of oil and gas exploration within the Okrug has seen associated revenues increase dramatically, with €190 million generated in 2007 compared to only €6.7 million ten years prior, with fuel industry&#x27;s share of the districts GRP increasing from 65% in 2001 to 80% in 2005. This increase in revenue has resulted from a marked increase in investment in the area by the parent companies of the concerns operating in the District, such as Rosneft, Lukoil, Total, Surgutneftegas and TNK-BP, whose input equates to approximately 90% of the total annual investment in the district. This investment has included the construction of an oil terminal in the Barents Sea at a cost of approximately €700 million by an independent company especially created to oversee the construction and administration of the terminal, a pipeline to connect the terminal to the ZPS Southern Khylchuyu oilfields at a cost of around €250 million, the completion of the Kharyaga-Indiga pipeline and a gas plant near Khumzha. This allows the transportation of oil and gas throughout the region and into the general Russian pipeline network. There are currently more than 80 separate oil and gas sites of exploration, and it is estimated that there is around 5 billion tons of oil and around 500 billion cubic meters of gas in the district.

In the first quarter of 2009, industrial production grew by 34.7% compared with the same period last year However, investments in industrial and housing construction decreased by 60.6% and 90.9% respectively, in the first three months of 2009, oil production totaled 4,419 million tons, an increase of over 35% on the same period in the previous year

===Infrastructure===
As a result of the significant and speedy increase in investment in the area, the district is faced with a widespread infrastructure problem meaning that progress at many of the oil and gas exploration sites is hampered by accessibility issues, compounded by the severe arctic climate of the district. The Duma of Nenets Autonomous Okrug has stated their intention to address this issue as a priority, including the construction of the third phase of the Naryan-Mar-Usinsk road, construction of a Naryan-Mar-Telviska-Velikovisochnoye pipeline and a renovation of the wastewater treatment system in Iskateley.

Further plans by Russian railways include the construction of two railways linking settlements in Zapolyarny Municipal District, one, a line running 210 km from Vorkuta, in the Komi Republic, to Ust-Kara in the far east of the district, and another running from Sosnogorsk, also in the Komi Republic, to Indiga in the west of the district. Officials have also proposed that the line to Ust-Kara be extended to Amderma to provide adequate transportation routes to allow the economic extraction of several mineral deposits, with an estimated worth of between €100–135 billion.

Without this investment in infrastructure, the main means of transportation is air, with regular flights to Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Arkangelsk and Usa. In the summer, the main river in the district, the Pechora is used to transport freight.

===Indigenous economy===
Reindeer husbandry is considered central to the Nenets&#x27; way of life, despite only 14% of Nenets people being involved in herding directly at the end of the twentieth century. There are three types of reindeer in the district: collective, personal and private. The majority of reindeer are owned by collective farms, with Nenets people employed to look after them. Those employed in such a capacity are then permitted to own additional personal reindeer, which do not require registration, nor a permit for grazing. The private reindeer are held by the association of reindeer herders, Erv, but these are very much the minority, with reports in 1997 indicating that over 70% of reindeer were held collectively, over 20% personally and only just over 2% privately.

The reindeer are kept, not only to provide for the families of the herders, but also to produce meat and antlers for sale. This meat is mainly sold within the district, since the price of reindeer meat has traditionally been lower than pork or beef, but there are other markets in the Komi Republic and Arkhangelsk Oblast. These outlets are used mainly by groups such as Erv, which have come into existence since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Those groups that effectively represent a continuity of the old collective farm economy, such as Vyucheiskiy and Kharp, generally continue to provide their reindeer to a slaughterhouse as they have always done, which results in lower profits than are generated through Erv&#x27;s business plan, causing instability and debt amongst the collective farms though it is recognised that these collective farms do provide employment to those who would otherwise be without jobs.

There has been little significant change in the organisation of the reindeer herding enterprises between Soviet times and today, with little change in the number of businesses and those that continue to exist still practising the same business model, making changes only to the branding of the business.

<text>Hot dry noodles (), known in Chinese as reganmian, is a traditional dish of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in central China. Hot dry noodles have an 80-year history in Chinese food culture; they are unique because the noodles are not in a broth like most other Asian-style hot noodle dishes. 
They are the most significant, famous and popular breakfast food in Wuhan, often sold by street carts and restaurants in residential and business areas.
The price is between 4-6 yuan. Breakfasts such as hot dry noodles are available from about 5 am, These noodles can be prepared within minutes and are affordable, so they are a popular breakfast. There are hot dry noodle restaurants all over the city. 

Typical hot dry noodle dishes contain soy sauce, sesame paste, pickled vegetables (carrots and beans), chopped garlic chives and chili oil. Hot dry noodles, along with Shanxi&#x27;s knife-cut noodles (刀削面; 刀削麵; &quot;dāoxiāomiàn&quot;), Liangguang&#x27;s &quot;yifumian&quot;, Sichuan&#x27;s &quot;dandanmian&quot;, and northern China&#x27;s &quot;zhajiangmian&quot;, are collectively referred to as the &quot;top five noodles of China&quot; by People&#x27;s Daily, and in a 2013 article titled &quot;China&#x27;s Top 10 famous noodles&quot; Business Insider reported that CNTV rated hot dry noodles the top Chinese noodle dish. The specifics of the preparation of hot dry noodles is discussed in Wuhan author Chi Li&#x27;s novel &quot;Cold or Hot, It&#x27;s Good to Live&quot; (冷也好热也好活着就好).

==Cooking Method==

The recipe for hot dry noodles differs from cold noodles and soup noodles, as the dish is served hot without broth.

Source:

Noodles Preparation

The fresh alkali water noodles are cooked until they are about 90% done, then removed from the water and mixed with sesame oil to prevent sticking. The noodles are then spread out on a surface to cool down.

Before serving, place the noodles in a cone-shaped strainer, dip briefly into boiling water, swirl, and drain.

Sauce and Seasoning

Once the noodles are reheated, transfer them to a bowl and drizzle with a prepared sauce mixture. The sauce typically includes sesame paste, soy sauce, pickled radish, and other seasonings like Chinese chives, chili oil, vinegar, MSG, pepper, and chicken broth, according to taste. Additional toppings such as chopped scallions, pickled vegetables, or mustard greens may also be added.

Final Steps

Once seasoned, thoroughly mix the noodles to evenly coat them with the sauce. Serve immediately while hot.

Detailed Noodle Preparation

To prepare the noodles, mix alkali powder with water a day in advance. Then, combine the alkali water, salt, and flour in a ratio of 2:1:250, knead the dough, and roll it into noodles of 1.5-1.6mm in diameter for optimal texture.

Bring a large pot of water to a high heat, and before it boils, add the raw noodles. Stir continuously to prevent clumping, and intermittently add cold water after boiling while covering the pot. Once the noodles turn transparent, remove them and drain using a colander. Spread the drained noodles out, mix with sesame oil, and let them cool.

Sauce Preparation

To make the sauce, mix soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, pepper, MSG, sesame paste, sesame oil, red and white carrot cubes, and Chinese chives in the proportion of 20:8:1:1:15:18:5:4:5. Additionally, dissolve sugar in soy sauce at a 1:50 ratio. The sauce is then ready to be drizzled over the reheated noodles.

==Origin==
Summer in Wuhan is extremely long, and the high temperature causes food to deteriorate rapidly. Consequently, in the past people added dietary alkali into noodles to slow deterioration; this evolved into &quot;Hot Dry Noodles.&quot;

There is no certain script that clarifies the inventor of hot dry noodles. Here are the versions of the creators of hot dry noodles:

=== Bao Li ===

According to a widely circulated version of the origin story, in the 1930s, there was a small food stand on Changdi Street operated by Bao Li, a hawker who made a living by selling bean noodles and noodle soups in the Guandi temple area in Hankou. Due to the hot weather, business was bad and many noodles were not sold. There were no refrigerators at that time. If these noodles were sold the next day, they would definitely go bad and be inedible. What to do? Li Bao was very worried. Suddenly, Li poured sesame oil onto his noodles accidentally; he boiled them and added shallot and other condiments the next day, and sold them the next morning. His noodles became very popular because of their unique taste, and customers asked Bao Li what kind of noodle it was; Bao Li answered &quot;hot dry noodles&quot;.

From then on, Bao Li specialized in hot dry noodles, which caused a sensation in Wuhan with many customers. Many cooks learned from him and specialized in making hot dry noodles. However, most people considered Bao Li as the inventor of the way of making such noodles. His version of hot dry noodles has huge difference compared to the hot dry noodles nowadays. 

=== Cai Mingwei ===
Cai Mingwei was born in April 1912 in Caijiazha Street, Huangpi District. He worked in a Pharmacy in Hankou for 6 years. After leaving the Pharmacy, he started to sell noodles. This kind of noodles is made by boiling traditional oil noodles, taking them out, pouring sesame oil on them and mixing them together. Many people in Hankou make a living from this, especially the people from Huangpi. Cai Mingwei chose to do business for students at the school gate. In the process of selling noodles, he gradually improved the taste of noodles. In order to make noodles quickly in the morning, he cooked the noodles to 80% done in advance, poured water to cool them down, added oil to mix them, spread them out to cool and dry them, and rolled them into a bunch for use. When buying noodles, boil them in boiling water, remove the core and add seasonings, and they can be eaten, which increases the speed. Later, in order to increase the toughness of machine-made noodles, he absorbed the practice of oil noodles and gradually added salt and edible alkali. His work experience as a pharmacy clerk made him realize the role of sesame oil, so he tried to add sesame paste without decanting oil to noodles, and sprinkled sesame oil, balsamic vinegar and other homemade special seasonings on it to form sesame paste noodles. Later, Cai Mingwei also cut the carrots from his hometown in Huangpi into strips, marinated them with salt, soy sauce, five-spice powder, etc., and dried them slightly after draining them. Finally, he added pure sesame paste, pepper powder, and granulated sugar, and finally formed the hot dry noodles that Wuhan people eat now.

Hot dry noodles were officially named in 1950. In 1945, after the victory of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Cai Mingwei opened the famous hot dry noodles restaurant Cai Lin Ji at the corner of Manchun Road, Zhongshan Avenue. According to legend, the name of Cai Lin Ji came from two tall Chinaberries in front of the store. Some people say that the two trees, firstly, symbolize your hard work and happiness, secondly, Cai Mingwei has two sons, so good things come in pairs, and naming the store Cai Lin Ji will bring good luck.

== Cultural significance ==
Hot dry noodles is not only a delicacy, but also a symbol of culture. It carries the memory and emotions of Wuhan people and is an indispensable part of their lives.
===Geographical environment and climate===

Talking about hot dry noodles&#x27;s significance, the local climate plays an important role in such cuisine. 

Wuhan has a subtropical monsoon climate in the central part of the city, with abundant rainfall and sunshine. There are many water bodies, and the entire city is divided into three parts the Yangtze River and the Han River. There are also large and small lakes including the East Lake, and the terrain is mainly plains. Under such climatic conditions, it is difficult for local heat to dissipate in the summer, resulting in hot and humid weather. Food is hard to stay fresh in such circumstances. However, the noodles of hot dry noodles are processed with alkaline water (baking soda + water) which has low water content and is more durable than ordinary noodles. The ingredients of the sauce are also easily stored and hard to get bad. The quality of noodles and sauce allows hot dry noodles to be made by families and restaurants at any time. In winter, due to the lack of terrain barriers, it is easily affected by cold air from the north, the humidity is high and the cold is biting. The weather is cold in the winter. But the noodles of hot dry noodles are dry, durable, and not affected by moisture since they absorb the alkaline water

The climate and environment will also change the appetite of people in Wuhan. In summer, a hot and humid environment makes people feel tired and have poor appetites. But hot dry noodles, due to the sesame paste and vinegar, have a strong taste which could quickly arouse appetite.In winter, people need high-calorie food to keep warm. Sesame paste is high in fat and the noodles are high in carbohydrates which could help people to replenish energy.

===Humanities===

Eating breakfast in Wuhan is commonly known as &quot;Guozao&quot; which means the special bond between people in Wuhan and the breakfast. In the 20th century, ships often passed by the docks in Wuhan, and boatmen, dock workers, and merchants from all over the country gathered here. In such a crowded and mobile area, people also demanded simple and fast food, so hot dry noodles became the first choice. Nowadays, people in Wuhan are accustomed to getting up early to go to work or do morning practice. Hot dry noodles are still the top choice for breakfast. Besides that, people in Wuhan have the habit of eating food while walking. The convenience of hot dry noodles makes such a common habit more common.

== Variety ==
During the development and spread of the technique of making hot dry noodles, people in Xinyang, a city in Henan Province, developed their own special way to make them, which became a variant of hot dry noodles eventually.

The difference on hot dry noodle between Wuhan and xinyang is quantity，xinyang hot dry noodle generally use a larger bowl than Wuhan. And Wuhan hot dry noodles are usually eaten in the morning. In Wuhan, they usually cook the noodles in water first and then add the sauce, but xinyang uses beef and minced beef，and then add meat soup. In contrast, Xinyang hot dry noodles have a more mellow flavor. In terms of seasoning, Wuhan hot dry noodles use a higher percentage of peanuts in sesame sauce, but Xinyang is more of a sesame sauce flavor. 

== Region ==
China

Small restaurants serving Wuhan&#x27;s hot dry noodles, which have been a staple of the local population for hundreds of years, are located throughout China and serve a variety of inexpensive dishes, with egg drop soups as well as wonton stews to choose from. Hot noodles can be served with beef or lamb, making it a dish for all seasons.

Japan 

There&#x27;s a restaurant in Ginza, Tokyo, Japan that has relatively authentic hot dry noodles for 19 RMB, but interestingly enough, it uses noodles that have been prepared with black sesame seeds and filled with crushed peanuts.

United States

In Flushing, New York, where there is a Chinese hot dry noodle store, Wuhan people there have a sense of home, which is also the only authentic hot dry noodle store, and priced at 30-40 yuan.

<text>Komi-Permyak Okrug (, &quot;Komi-Permyatsky okrug&quot;; , Komi-Perem kyč), or Permyakia was a territory with special status within Perm Krai, Russia. Its administrative center was the town of Kudymkar. Population: 

It was a federal subject of Russia (an autonomous okrug) until December 1, 2005. It was known as [[Komi-Permyak Autonomous Okrug]] (; ) at the time.

==Geography==
Area: 32,770 km2. Location: foothills of the Ural Mountains, upper basin of the Kama River.

==History==
Komi-Permyak Autonomous Okrug was established on February 26, 1925. It was an administrative division for Komi-Permyaks, a branch of the Komis, within Perm Oblast. After a referendum held in October 2004, the autonomous okrug was merged with Perm Oblast to form Perm Krai. The referendum was held both in Komi-Permyak Autonomous Okrug and Perm Oblast, and the majority of citizens of both regions voted for merging.

Until the merger in 2005, the Komi-Permyak Autonomous Okrug was the only autonomous okrug in which the titular ethnic group made up the majority of the population. The majority was lost in the merger, and the referendum has often been characterized as a &quot;staged&quot; event.

<text>The Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (; ) also known as Yamalia () is a federal subject of Russia and an autonomous okrug of Tyumen Oblast. Its administrative center is the town of Salekhard, and its largest city is Novy Urengoy. The 2021 Russian Census recorded its population as 510,490.

The autonomous okrug borders Krasnoyarsk Krai to the east, the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug to the south, and the Nenets Autonomous Okrug and Komi Republic to the west.

==Geography==
The West Siberian petroleum basin is the largest hydrocarbon (petroleum and natural gas) basin in the world covering an area of about 2.2 million km2, and is also the largest oil and gas producing region in Russia.

The Nenets people are an indigenous tribe who have long survived in this region. Their prehistoric life involved subsistence hunting and gathering, including the taking of polar bears; the practice of hunting polar bears (&quot;Ursus maritimus&quot;) continues up to the present time.

Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug is traversed by the northeasterly line of equal latitude and longitude, that is, at the point 70°N and 70°E, with equal degrees. The Polar Urals rise in the western part and the highest point of the okrug, as well as of the whole Ural mountain system, is Mount Payer.

The area consists of arctic tundra and taiga, with three large peninsulas – the Yamal Peninsula, Taz Peninsula and the Gyda Peninsula (itself containing the Yavay Peninsula and Mamonta Peninsula). There are nearly 300,000 lakes in the okrug, some of the main ones being Pyakuto, Chyortovo, Neito, Yambuto, Yarroto and Nembuto.

The Ob River flows through Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug to the Kara Sea via the Gulf of Ob, which dominates the geography of the Okrug (together with its two sub-bays, the Taz Estuary and Khalmyer Bay.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://russiatrek.org/yamalo-nenets-okrug&quot;&gt;Yamalo-Nenets region, Russia facts, resources, climate, photos: Yamalo-Nenets region, Russia facts, resources, climate, photos, accessdate: May 5, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of islands are off the okrug&#x27;s coast – from west to east, the main ones are Torasovey Island, Bolotnyy Island, Litke Island, Sharapovy Koshki Islands, Bely Island, Shokalsky Island, Petsovyye Islands, Proklyatyye Islands, Oleny Island, and Vilkitsky Island.

==History==
On December 10, 1930, Yamal (Nenets) National Okrug () was formed based on Ural Oblast.

==Demographics==
Population: 

From 1960 to 2016, Yamal Nenets population increased from 60 000 people to more than 530 000 due to the natural resources discovered in the region. Currently, Yamal Nenets is the only Arctic Region in the Russian Federation that is not experiencing population decline. Despite the growing pressure on the regional environment, former governor Dmitry Kobylkin assured in 2016 that industrial developments are not affecting the traditional lifestyles of the native population. Official data accounts for an increment of 11 percent of the indigenous population from 2006 to 2016.

===Vital statistics===
====Regional demographics====

===Ethnic groups===
The Nenets make up 8.9% of the population, preceded by ethnic Russians (62.9%), and followed by Tatars (4.7%) and Ukrainians (4.5%). Other prominent ethnic groups include Khanty (2.5%), Azerbaijanis (1.7%), Bashkirs (1.5%), Kumyks (1.2%), and Nogais (0.9%) (all figures are from the 2021 Census). Due to the area&#x27;s oil and natural gas wealth, it is one of the few places in Russia where the ethnic Russian population is growing.
===Religion===
According to a 2012 survey 42.2% of the population of Yamalia adhere to the Russian Orthodox Church, 14% are unaffiliated generic Christians, 1% are believers in Orthodox Christianity who do not belong to any church, 1% are members of the Slavic neopaganism (Rodnovery) or practitioners of local shamanic religions, and 1% are members of Protestant churches; Muslims, mostly Caucasian peoples and Tatars, make up 18% of the total population. In addition, 14% of the population declare to be &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot;, 8% are atheist, and 0.8% follow other religions or did not give an answer to the question.
==Economy==

In 2009, Yamalo-Nenetsky Avtonomny Okrug is Russia&#x27;s most important source of natural gas, with more than 90% of Russia&#x27;s natural gas being produced there. The region also accounts for 12% of Russia&#x27;s oil production. The region is the most important to Russia&#x27;s largest company Gazprom, whose main production fields are located there. Novatek – the country&#x27;s second-largest gas producer – is also active in the region, with its headquarters located in Tarko-Sale. According to Novatek on 22 October 2019, the natural gas reserves in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug represent 80% of Russia&#x27;s natural gas and 15% of the world&#x27;s natural gas supply.

Since the early 2010s Gazprom has been developing Yamal project in the Yamal Peninsula area. As of 2020, Yamal produces over 20% of Russia&#x27;s gas, which is expected to increase to 40% by 2030. The shortest pipeline routes from Yamal to the northern EU countries are the Yamal–Europe pipeline through Poland and Nord Stream 1 to Germany. The proposed gas route from Western Siberia to China is known as Power of Siberia 2 pipeline.

<text>Taymyr Dolgano-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (, &#x27;; [[Enets language|Enets]]: Таймыр Оша-Дюрак район, [[Nenets languages|Nenets]]: Таймыр Долганы-Ненэцие район) was a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (an [[autonomous okrug]] of [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]]), the northernmost in Siberian Russia (and thus [[North Asia]]). It was named after the [[Taymyr Peninsula]]. It was also calledDolgan-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (Долгано-Ненецкий автономный округ), by the name of the indigenous people Dolgans and Nenets.


With an area of 862,100 km2 (ranked 4th) and a population of 39,786 (2002 Census), the autonomous okrug was one of the least densely populated areas of Russia as of 2006. Dudinka, with more than half of Taymyr&#x27;s inhabitants, was the administrative center.

Following a referendum on the issue held on April 17, 2005, Taymyr Dolgano-Nenets and Evenk Autonomous Okrugs were merged into Krasnoyarsk Krai effective January 1, 2007. Taymyr was given a special status within Krasnoyarsk Krai and incorporated as Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District.

==Administrative divisions==


The city of Norilsk, even though it is geographically located within Taymyr Autonomous Okrug, was administratively subordinated directly to Krasnoyarsk Krai prior to the merger. This also applied to the urban-type settlement of Snezhnogorsk, which was administratively subordinated to Norilsk. Therefore, the okrug&#x27;s population reported by the Census authorities does not include the populations of Norilsk and Snezhnogorsk.

==In popular culture==
Although not actually having been filmed in Taymyr, it is depicted in the 1985 film &quot;White Nights&quot;, starring Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gregory Hines. During the opening moments of the film, Baryshnikov&#x27;s character Nikolai Rodchenko – a Soviet defector – is on a passenger plane that crash lands at &quot;Norilsk Air Base&quot;. He later is taken into the home of Hines&#x27; character – a US defector – and his wife (played by Isabella Rossellini), where they advise him that he is in Taymyr upon regaining consciousness.

Taymyr is featured in the 2020 simulation video game &quot;SnowRunner&quot; as the third playable region of the game.

<text>Tetrachromacy (from Greek &quot;tetra&quot;, meaning &quot;four&quot; and &quot;chroma&quot;, meaning &quot;color&quot;) is the condition of possessing four independent channels for conveying color information, or possessing four types of cone cell in the eye. Organisms with tetrachromacy are called tetrachromats.

In tetrachromatic organisms, the sensory color space is four-dimensional, meaning that matching the sensory effect of arbitrarily chosen spectra of light within their visible spectrum requires mixtures of at least four primary colors.

Tetrachromacy is demonstrated among several species of birds, fishes, and reptiles. The common ancestor of all vertebrates was a tetrachromat, but a common ancestor of mammals lost two of its four kinds of cone cell, evolving dichromacy, a loss ascribed to the conjectured nocturnal bottleneck. Some primates then later evolved a third cone.

==Physiology==
The normal explanation of tetrachromacy is that the organism&#x27;s retina contains four types of higher-intensity light receptors (called cone cells in vertebrates as opposed to rod cells, which are lower-intensity light receptors) with different spectral sensitivity. This means that the organism may see wavelengths beyond those of a typical human&#x27;s vision, and may be able to distinguish between colors that, to a normal human, appear to be identical. Species with tetrachromatic color vision may have an unknown physiological advantage over rival species.

==Humans==

Apes (including humans) and Old World monkeys normally have only three types of cone cell, and are therefore trichromats. However, human tetrachromacy is suspected to exist in a small percentage of the population. Trichromats have three types of cone cells, each type being sensitive to a corresponding portion of the spectrum as shown in the diagram. But at least one woman has been implied to be a tetrachromat. More precisely, she had an additional cone type &quot;L′&quot;, intermediate between &quot;M&quot; and &quot;L&quot; in its responsivity, and showed 3 dimensional (&quot;M&quot;, &quot;L′&quot;, and &quot;L&quot; components) color discrimination for wavelengths 546–670 nm (to which the fourth type, &quot;S&quot;, is insensitive).

Tetrachromacy requires that there be four independent photoreceptor cell classes with different spectral sensitivity. However, there must also be the appropriate post-receptoral mechanism to compare the signals from the four classes of receptors. According to the opponent process theory, humans have three opponent channels, which give trichromacy. It is unclear whether having available a fourth opponent channel is sufficient for tetrachromacy.

Mice, which normally have only two cone pigments (and therefore two opponent channels), have been engineered to express a third cone pigment, and appear to demonstrate increased chromatic discrimination,
possibly indicating trichromacy, and suggesting they were able to create or re-enable a third opponent channel. This would support the theory that humans should be able to utilize a fourth opponent channel for tetrachromatic vision. However, the original publication&#x27;s claims about plasticity in the optic nerve have also been disputed.

===Tetrachromacy in carriers of CVD===
It has been theorized that females who carry recessive opsin alleles that can cause color vision deficiency (CVD) could possess tetrachromacy. Female carriers of anomalous trichromacy (mild color blindness) possess heterozygous alleles of the genes that encode the L-opsin or M-opsin. These alleles often have a different spectral sensitivity, so if the carrier expresses both opsin alleles, they may exhibit tetrachromacy.

In humans, two cone cell pigment genes are present on the The classical type 2 opsin gene OPN1MW and OPN1MW2. People with two X chromosomes could possess multiple cone cell pigments, perhaps born as full tetrachromats who have four simultaneously-functioning kinds of cone cell, each type with a specific pattern of responsiveness to different wavelengths of light in the range of the visible spectrum.
One study suggested that 15% of the world&#x27;s women might have the type of fourth cone whose sensitivity peak is between the standard red and green cones, theoretically giving a significant increase in color differentiation.
Another study suggests that as many as 50% of women and 8% of men may have four photopigments and corresponding increased chromatic discrimination, compared to trichromats.
In 2010, after twenty years&#x27; study of women with four types of cones (non-functional tetrachromats), neuroscientist Gabriele Jordan identified a woman (subject &quot;&#x27;cDa29&#x27;&quot;) who could detect a greater variety of colors than trichromats could, corresponding with a functional or &quot;true&quot; tetrachromat.
Specifically, she has been shown to be a trichromat in the range 546–670 nm where people with normal vision are essentially dichromats due to negligible response of &quot;S&quot; cones to those wavelengths. Thus, if &quot;S&quot; cones of &#x27;cDa29&#x27; provide independent color perception dimension as they normally do, that would confirm her being a tetrachromat when the whole spectrum is considered.

Variation in cone pigment genes is widespread in most human populations, but the most prevalent and pronounced tetrachromacy would derive from female carriers of major red / green pigment anomalies, usually classed as forms of &quot;color blindness&quot; (protanomaly or deuteranomaly). The biological basis for this phenomenon is X-inactivation of heterozygotic alleles for retinal pigment genes, which is the same mechanism that gives the majority of female New World monkeys trichromatic vision.

In humans, preliminary visual processing occurs in the neurons of the retina. It is not known how these nerves would respond to a new color channel: Whether they would handle it separately, or just combine it with one of the existing channels. Similarly, visual information leaves the eye by way of the optic nerve, and a variety of final image processing takes place in the brain; it is not known whether the optic nerve or the areas of the brain have any capacity to effectively respond if presented with a stimulus from a new color signal.

Tetrachromacy may also enhance vision in dim lighting, or in looking at a screen.

===Conditional tetrachromacy===
Despite being trichromats, humans can experience slight tetrachromacy at low light intensities, using their mesopic vision. In mesopic vision, both cone cells and rod cells are active. While rods typically do not contribute to color vision, in these specific light conditions, they may give a small region of tetrachromacy in the color space.
Human rod cell sensitivity is greatest at 500 nm (bluish-green) wavelength, which is significantly different from the peak spectral sensitivity of the cones (typically 420, 530, and 560 nm).

===Blocked tetrachromacy===
Although many birds are tetrachromats with a fourth color in the ultraviolet, humans cannot see ultraviolet light directly because the lens of the eye blocks most light in the wavelength range of 300–400 nm; shorter wavelengths are blocked by the cornea.
The photoreceptor cells of the retina are sensitive to near ultraviolet light, and people lacking a lens (a condition known as aphakia) see near ultraviolet light (down to 300 nm) as whitish blue, or for some wavelengths, whitish violet, probably because all three types of cones are roughly equally sensitive to ultraviolet light (with blue cone cells slightly more sensitive).

While an extended visible range does not denote tetrachromacy, some believe that visual pigments are available with sensitivity in near-UV wavelengths that would enable tetrachromacy in the case of aphakia.
However, there is no peer-reviewed evidence supporting this claim.

==Other animals==

===Fish===
Fish, specifically teleosts, are typically tetrachromats. Exceptions include:
* Sharks and rays – range from monochromacy to trichromacy
* Deep-sea fish – often rod monochromats
* Cichlid – arguably pentachromacy or higher

===Birds===
Some species of birds, such as the zebra finch and the Columbidae, use the ultraviolet wavelength 300–400 nm specific to tetrachromatic color vision as a tool during mate selection and foraging. When selecting for mates, ultraviolet plumage and skin coloration show a high level of selection. A typical bird eye responds to wavelengths from about 300–700 nm. In terms of frequency, this corresponds to a band in the vicinity of 430–1000 THz. Most birds have retinas with four spectral types of cone cell that are believed to mediate tetrachromatic color vision. Bird color vision is further improved by filtering by pigmented oil droplets in the photoreceptors. The oil droplets filter incident light before it reaches the visual pigment in the outer segments of the photoreceptors.

The four cone types, and the specialization of pigmented oil droplets, give birds better color vision than that of humans. However, more recent research has suggested that tetrachromacy in birds only provides birds with a larger visual spectrum than that in humans (humans cannot see ultraviolet light, 300–400 nm), while the spectral resolution (the &quot;sensitivity&quot; to nuances) is similar.

Some birds such as corvids, Old and New World flycatchers, as well as most diurnal raptors, have little ability to see UV light, with the fourth cone type instead peaking in the violet range. It is believed that UV vision in raptors is selected against because short-wavelength UVA light contributes highly to chromatic aberration, reducing visual acuity which raptorial birds rely on for hunting.

==Pentachromacy and greater==
The dimensionality of color vision has no upper bound, but vertebrates with color vision greater than tetrachromacy are rare. The next level is &quot;pentachromacy&quot;, which is five-dimensional color vision requiring at least 5 different classes of photoreceptor as well as 5 independent channels of color information through the primary visual system.

A female that is heterozygous for both the LWS and MWS opsins (and therefore a carrier for both protanomaly and deuteranomaly) would express five opsins of different spectral sensitivity. However, for her to be a true (strong) pentachromat, these opsins would need to be segregated into different photoreceptor cells and she would need to have the appropriate post-receptoral mechanisms to handle 5 opponent process channels, which is contentious. 

Some birds (notably pigeons) have five or more kinds of color receptors in their retinae, and are therefore believed to be pentachromats, though psychophysical evidence of functional pentachromacy is lacking. Research also indicates that some lampreys, members of the Petromyzontiformes, may be pentachromats.

Invertebrates can have large numbers of different opsin classes, including 15 opsins in bluebottle butterflies or 33 in mantis shrimp. However, it has not been shown that color vision in these invertebrates is of a dimension commensurate with the number of opsins.

<text>The United States Agency for Global Media (USAGM), known until 2018 as the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), is an independent agency of the United States government that broadcasts news and information. It is considered an arm of U.S. diplomacy.

The USAGM supervises Voice of America (VOA) and Office of Cuba Broadcasting as well as state-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Open Technology Fund.

==History==
===Early years===
The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) was formed in 1994 with the passing of the International Broadcasting Act. The act established a bipartisan board that consisted of nine voting members, eight of whom were to be appointed by the president for a three–year term. The ninth was the secretary of state, also a political appointee, who would serve as an &quot;ex officio&quot; board member for the duration of their term as secretary. At this point, BBG was considered a part of the U.S. Information Agency.

The first voting members of the BBG, confirmed on August 11, 1995, were David W. Burke, Ted Kaufman, Tom C. Korologos, Bette Bao Lord, Alberto J. Mora, Cheryl Halpern, Marc Nathanson, and Carl Spielvogel.

On October 1, 1999, the BBG was established as an independent agency by the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998.

The Agency has five broadcasting entities that were established from 1942 - 2004. The Voice of America (VOA) has been in operation since World War II. William Harlan Hale, a journalist and writer, began the VOA&#x27;s first radio show by saying &quot;We bring you voices from America. Today, and daily from now on, we shall speak to you about America and the War. The news may be good for us. The news may be bad. But we shall tell you the truth.&quot;

Then, in 1950, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) went on the air. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) was started in 1985. Radio Free Asia (RFA) was founded in 1996.

===2000-present===
In 2002, BBG launched Radio Sawa, a 24/7 Arabic language radio network that broadcasts news and a mix of Western and Arabic music in the Middle East.

In 2004, Alhurra TV was created as a televised sister network to Radio Sawa and began broadcasting throughout the Middle East. Since its founding, it has established programs such as &quot;Al Youm&quot; (&quot;Today&quot; in English), a daily three-hour news program broadcast from five countries on three different continents; and &quot;Musawat&quot; (&quot;Equality&quot; in English), a program that focuses on women&#x27;s issues and rights in the Arab world.

To oversee Arabic broadcasts, the Middle East Broadcasting Network, Inc (MBN) was initiated in 2005.

Other networks were also expanded under the BBG. Voice of America worked with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to launch Radio Farda, a Persian-language radio program targeting youth. In 2006, VOA initiated TV Ashna, a one-hour televised news broadcast, and Radio Deewa, a daily radio program of sports, music, and local and international news.

In a January 2015 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the then newly appointed CEO of the BBG, Andrew Lack, said &quot;We are facing a number of challenges from entities like Russia Today which is out there pushing a point of view, the Islamic State in the Middle East and groups like Boko Haram. But I firmly believe that this agency has a role to play in facing those challenges.&quot;

The board of USAGM has an advisory role. It previously supervised USAGM media networks directly, but was replaced with a single appointed chief executive officer (CEO) as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, passed in December 2016.

In 2018, the BBG changed its name to the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM). The name change was initiated to help constituents better understand what USAGM does.

The Open Technology Fund (OTF), launched in 2019, works to advance internet freedom, so USAGM journalists and audiences can have uncensored internet access. Over 2 billion people worldwide use OTF daily.

State Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki clarified Lack&#x27;s statement in her January 23 press briefing, saying &quot;would the U.S. Government put those three in the same category? No, we wouldn&#x27;t. However, there are concerns...that Russia&#x27;s own independent media space is shrinking and the Kremlin continues to apply pressure on the few remaining outlets.&quot;

On January 19, 2021, the nonprofit Government Accountability Project, representing fired USAGM employees and whistleblowers, sent a letter to the congressional foreign affairs committees, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, and the Inspector General of the US Department of State. The letter said that Pack had hired the McGuireWoods law firm to investigate USAGM employees and the OTF at a cost of over $2 million in the last quarter of 2020, bypassing US government investigators including USAGM&#x27;s own Office of Human Resources, and called for further investigation of what it termed a gross misuse of taxpayer dollars. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; later reported that a second law firm, Caplin &amp; Drysdale, had also been granted a similar no-bid contract in possible violation of federal contracting regulations for a total cost of $4 million.

On January 20, 2021, journalist Kelu Chao was appointed acting CEO of the USAGM, replacing outgoing CEO Michael Pack.

In September 2022, Amanda Bennett, a journalist and Pulitzer Prize-winning author, received bipartisan confirmation by the U.S. Senate to become CEO.
Bennett was sworn in as CEO on December 6, 2022.

In January 2025 President Trump named a conservative critic of the mainstream media, L. Brent Bozell III, as his pick to run the U.S. Agency for Global Media

==Leadership==
USAGM is led by a single chief executive officer appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Until 2016, it was headed by a bi-partisan board with nine members; eight were appointed by the president with Senate confirmation, and the ninth member &quot;ex officio&quot; was the Secretary of State. By law, no more than four members could be from the same political party, in an effort to limit partisanship. The president designated one member (other than the Secretary of State) to serve as Chairman. The Board served as a &quot;firewall&quot; against political interference in the journalistic product.

Upon the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 on December 23, 2016 the agency was placed under the direction of a single CEO. The board, officially renamed as the International Broadcasting Advisory Board, was reduced to five members appointed by the president to serve in an advisory role. Previously appointed board members in excess of five could continue to serve, but would not be replaced when their term expired. Under the 2016 reform legislation, any new agency CEO is to be nominated by the U.S. president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate with authority to select key agency personnel. Former USAGM CEO John F. Lansing, who had been selected and approved in 2015 by the BBG Board holding a Democratic majority during the Obama administration, was not nominated by President Obama nor confirmed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate, as this was not required under previous legislation.

In June 2018, President Trump announced his intention to nominate documentary film producer Michael Pack to head the agency. He was confirmed by the Senate two years later, and served from June 5, 2020 until January 20, 2021, when he was asked to resign at the request of newly-inaugurated President Joe Biden. President Biden then appointed Kelu Chao as acting USAGM CEO.

President Biden then nominated Amanda Bennett for CEO. She received bipartisan confirmation from the U.S. Senate in September 2022 and was sworn into the position in December 2022.

===International Broadcasting Advisory Board===
The board advises the CEO of the agency, as appropriate. It is composed of seven members, six appointed by the president of the United States with the consent of the United States Senate, and the U.S. Secretary of State. Of the six appointed members, one each should be appointed from among four lists of at least three individuals submitted by the chairs and ranking members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. All six members shall not be regular, full-time employees of the U.S. government, and be appointed on the basis of being distinguished in the fields of public diplomacy, mass communications, print, broadcast or digital media, or foreign affairs. These six are appointed to a single term of four years, but they may continue to serve on the board until a successor is confirmed. Only three of these may be affiliated with the same political party.

The President designates one member to serve as chairperson, with the advice and consent of the Senate. A majority of the members of the board constitutes a quorum, when excluding the Secretary of State.

On January 3, 2025, President Joe Biden issued a memorandum designating an order of succession for officials of the agency to act as CEO in the event the office falls vacant. This memorandum was revoked by Donald Trump on January 20, the first day of his second presidency. Additionally, Trump reportedly dismissed the board members of International Broadcasting Advisory Board during his first week in office.

==Funding==
As a federal agency, USAGM&#x27;s budget request is part of the president&#x27;s budget request to Congress.

During the federal funding dispute for the fiscal year 2011, President Barack Obama sided with the BBG agreeing to language that the organization would &quot;expand unrestricted access to information on the Internet.&quot; The BBG received $10 million from Congress for the purpose of fighting Internet censorship in China and other countries.

The agency has $2 million earmarked to the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests through the Open Technology Fund. This funding was frozen in June 2020 as China was preparing to introduce a new national security law for Hong Kong.

President Biden&#x27;s budget request for 2023 includes $840 million for USAGM, which the Agency says will enable them to continue their &quot;vital mission to inform, engage, and connect people around the world in support of freedom and democracy.&quot; This is an increase of $29.6 million from the 2022 requested level.

==Reception==
In February 2010, BBG Executive Director Jeff Trimble collaborated with the National Security Council to publish a VOA statement about Iran&#x27;s jamming of international satellites. In an email to &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine, BBG&#x27;s Public Affairs Director responded to the controversy, stating &quot;the BBG &#x27;firewall&#x27; served to protect the integrity and credibility of our journalistic products. An official policy statement by a senior management official of the agency is not a journalistic product.&quot;

Later that year, Senator Tom Coburn held up the Obama administration&#x27;s appointments of Michael P. Meehan and Dana Perino to the board, with the aim of drawing attention to the organization&#x27;s perceived ineffectiveness, stating in an interview with &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine: &quot;The BBG is the most worthless organization in the federal government. It&#x27;s full of people who know nothing about media or foreign policy.&quot; Senator Jim DeMint also attempted to use the nominations to force a hearing on the BBG after frustrations with a perceived lack of congressional oversight over the organization. Coburn had written an open letter to then–Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in August 2010 citing &quot;longstanding concerns regarding transparency and effectiveness of our taxpayer funded international broadcasting agencies under the purview of the Broadcasting Board of Governors.&quot; Though a report on BBG was eventually given to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Coburn was ultimately unsuccessful in trying to block the appointments to the board.

In July 2016, the chairman of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, Jeff Shell, was denied entry into Russia. Matt Novak, writing for the tech website &quot;Gizmodo&quot;, referred to the BBG as the &quot;propaganda arm&quot; of the U.S. government and speculated that its alleged role in spreading propaganda on behalf of the U.S. government was the reason Shell was denied entry to Russia.

In 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the Agency had targeted Americans with Facebook ads for one of its outlets, which would violate the Smith–Mundt Act, a law &quot;to protect Americans from domestic propaganda&quot;.

In 2023, after Twitter decided to label the Voice of America&#x27;s account as government-funded media, a VOA spokesperson told NPR that the label &quot;causes unwarranted and unjustified concern about the accuracy and objectivity of [its] news coverage&quot;.

, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated USAGM to be &quot;Independent State Funded and State Managed/Owned Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

<text>A State of Origin competition is a type of sporting event between players representing their state or territory. State of Origin began in Australian rules football on 8 October 1977 between Western Australia (WA) and Victoria, at Subiaco Oval in Perth, the initial brainchild of Leon Larkin. The selection criteria for Australian football have varied, but they are generally applied to players who have played most of their juniors games in a particular state or territory, hence the name &quot;State of Origin&quot;. In Rugby League the criteria are different, where players are selected for where they either first played senior Rugby League or where they played in the majority of senior competitions. The annual Rugby League State of Origin series is one of Australia&#x27;s most popular sporting events. The name is also used in Australia for small sporting events which generally involve domestic representative teams.

It was devised to address the drift of most talented Australian rules players to the Victorian Football League (VFL) and the effect that this had on interstate matches. A similar situation existed in regard to the New South Wales Rugby League which attracted the best players from the Queensland Rugby League because of its far stronger and financially attractive competition. The latter was due to the increased funds of the New South Wales clubs, due to poker machines, which Queensland laws prohibited.

== History ==
The first recorded call for &#x27;state of origin&#x27; selection rules for interstate football was made in 1900. A journalist known as &quot;The Cynic&quot; writing for a rugby football periodical called &quot;The Referee&quot;, suggested that Stephen Spragg, who had moved to Queensland, should be able to play for his state of birth, New South Wales. The change did not eventuate, with residential selection rules prevailing both before and after the split into rugby league and rugby union until the concept was later resurrected for league. However, in rugby union the concept has never been used, as the Queensland and New South Wales teams ceased to be representative, instead becoming more like clubs.

=== Rugby league (Australia) ===
Traditionally, the basis for selecting players in representative international sides (i.e. their country of origin) did not extend to interstate sides in Australian rugby league. Instead players represented the state in which they played their club football as per the &#x27;residency rule&#x27;, in which they played for the club which represented the district they lived in. This gave a significant advantage to New South Wales, as the movement of players south was far greater than the movement north, especially beginning in the 1960s when the NSW state government allowed football clubs to install poker machine parlours at their social clubhouses. Flush with cash from their gambling interests, top Sydney clubs could easily pay lavish sums for Queensland talent that Brisbane clubs could not afford to match.

Former Queensland captain and Australian vice-captain Jack Reardon, who had later become a journalist, was the first to suggest that Sydney-based Queenslanders should be available for selection to represent their state. This would not eventuate until decades later, however, when New South Wales and Queensland played their first &quot;state of origin&quot; match on 8 July 1980. The Australian rules experience was echoed, with Queenslanders showing enormous interest in the game at Lang Park, Brisbane, although NSW-based players and journalists described it as &quot;the non-event of the century&quot;. Queensland defeated New South Wales in that match, and State of Origin has grown into Australia&#x27;s greatest sporting rivalry.

The popularity of State of Origin matches since then has not waned, and they remain one of Australia&#x27;s (and indeed the region&#x27;s) biggest sporting events. A record crowd of 91,513 attended a game at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 2015. The record for the annual three-game series was set in 2015, when a total of 224,135 people attended. The 2005 series saw an attendance record for a series with two matches in Queensland, with 187,374. The record television audience was set during game 1 of the 2009 series and stands at 3.48 million. Queensland has won 18 series from 1982–2013, and NSW has won 13, with 2 drawn. Queensland has won the most series in a row. (8 Series from 2006–2013).

Australian international teams are often selected based on performance in the State of Origin series.

New South Wales play in sky blue jerseys and are known as &quot;the Blues&quot;, a term dating from 1974 when a journalist used the name in an article. The Blues won that series, leading coach Jack Gibson to comment: &quot;I thought they went pretty well for a bunch of cockroaches&quot;. The Queensland team plays in a maroon jersey, and are called &quot;the Maroons&quot;. Both teams also have unbecoming nicknames – New South Wales: &quot;the Cockroaches&quot;; Queensland: &quot;the Cane Toads&quot;.

===Australian football===

The first &#x27;state of origin&#x27; game was an Australian Football game between Western Australia (WA) and Victoria, at Subiaco Oval in Perth on 8 October 1977. Leon Larkin, marketing manager of the Subiaco Football Club in the West Australian Football League (WAFL), negotiated with the VFL for two years, before arrangements for the game were finalised. In the words of football historian John Devaney:

Games involving each of the other states soon followed. In 1989, a crowd of 91,960 people – a record for interstate games in Australian rules – attended a game between Victoria and South Australia at the MCG.

However, attendance and interest declined during the 1990s, due to a variety of factors, such as the VFL&#x27;s ongoing conversion into a national club competition, the Australian Football League (AFL). The last official State of Origin game involving AFL players was held in 1999. However, a veterans&#x27; game was held annually from 1996 until 2019.

A one-off AFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match between Victorian and &quot;Dream Team&quot;, a team representing the rest of Australia, was staged on 10 May 2008 to celebrate 150 years of Australian Football; another one-off game, a State of Origin for Bushfire Relief Match, between Victoria and &quot;All-Stars&quot;, a team representing the rest of Australia, was staged to raise money for the victims of the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season.

===Rugby league (England)===
The success of the State of Origin series in Australian rugby league resulted in the revival of England&#x27;s inter-county games in 2001, under the name Origin Series. However, the revival was scrapped in 2003 amid increasing fixture congestion and general apathy from league supporters.

The International Origin Match, held from 2011 to 2013, was more of an all-star game, as it pitted the England national team against Australian and New Zealand stars in the largely English-based Super League.

<doc id="482083" wikidata="Q554358" url="?curid=482083" title="Barbu Catargiu">
<text>Barbu Catargiu (26 October 1807 – ) was a conservative Romanian politician and journalist. He was the first Prime Minister of Romania, in 1862, until he was assassinated on 20 June that year. He was a staunch defender of the great estates of the boyars, and notably originated the conservative doctrine that &quot;feudalism in Romania had never existed&quot;.

==Early life==
Barbu Catargiu was born on 26 October 1807 to Ștefan Catargiu, a political activist and Țița (Stanca) Văcărescu. He lived abroad in Paris from 1825 to 1834, where he studied law, history, and philosophy. He returned to Wallachia for a short time and was a member of the Obsteasca Assembly of Wallachia. An opponent of violence and armed revolution, he resumed his world travels during the Revolutions of 1848, working primarily as a journalist and making a documentary.

==Political life==
After his return to Romania, Catargiu entered political life as a firm conservative. He believed that evolution, rather than violent revolution was the best way to modernize the Government, and would give the fledgling Romania the best chance at unity. He also advocated an aristocratic republic as the best form of governance, clearly believing in guarding the power of the boyars.

Catargiu was appointed to the position of minister of finances by Alexandru Ioan Cuza. He quickly gained acclaim for his oratorical skills and became the focal point of the Conservative Party. He did very little to actually organize the party, instead depending on his own charisma and ideals to give the party focus. Cuza, despite not agreeing with the conservative doctrine and even seeing Catargiu as an adversary of sorts, recognized his abilities and the power of his followers and chose Catargiu as prime minister of the newly formed union between Wallachia and Moldavia.

On 15 February 1862, Catargiu was sworn in as the first prime minister of Romania, ruling from Bucharest. As prime minister, Catargiu hoped to reorganize and simplify the administration. He formed four administrative divisions, two in what had been Wallachia and two in Moldavia. He placed the four divisions under the supervision of a minister of the interior and unified the financial and judicial departments under the central government. Arguably the most important act of his rule was his order to begin a railroad in Moldavia that would link the two provinces and greatly aid unification. He also continued his support for the &quot;old order&quot; and claimed that large estates were historically sanctioned and were solely the property of the boyars. He also clamped down on rioting in the cities, censored the press, and refused to allow large assemblies to meet. He denied the right of the people to meet on the Bucharest &quot;Field of Liberty&quot; to commemorate the Revolution of 1848, an act which garnered him much animosity.

==Assassination==
One week after the &quot;Field of Liberty&quot; Incident, on 20 June 1862, Catargiu was shot and killed at close range when leaving a parliamentary meeting. The assassin was never apprehended, despite the efforts of the police force. The killing left the Conservative Party without a strong leader or sense of direction. They quickly lost power, as Catargiu was replaced by Nicolae Crețulescu, a much more progressive politician.

Despite Catargiu&#x27;s relative unpopularity, his memory was celebrated by the Romanians. A statue of him was placed opposite the Bibescu Vodă Park in Bucharest, near the Metropolitan Tower, close to where he was killed. It stood from 1900 until 1984; in 2001, it was restored, albeit without the original pedestal.

==1862 Cabinet==
During his premiership, Catargiu&#x27;s cabinet consisted of:

*Constantin N. Brăiloiu/Dimitrie Cornea (Justice)
*Alexandru Moruzi/Grigore Balș/Alexandru Catargi/Theodor Ghica (Finance)
*Ion Ghica (War)
*Apostol Arsache (Foreign Affairs)
*Barbu Catargiu/Dimitrie Cornea/Alexandru Florescu (Public Works)
*Barbu Catargiu/Apostol Arsache (Interior)

<doc id="482088" wikidata="Q1207735" url="?curid=482088" title="Tokyo City">
<text>was a municipality in Japan and capital of Tokyo Prefecture (or &quot;Tokyo-fu&quot;) which existed from 1 May 1889 until the establishment of Tokyo Metropolis on 1 July 1943. The historical boundaries of Tokyo City are now occupied by the special wards of Tokyo. The defunct city and its prefecture became what is now Tokyo, also known as the Tokyo Metropolis or, ambiguously, Tokyo Prefecture.

==History==
In 1868, the city of Edo, seat of the Tokugawa government, was renamed Tokyo, and the offices of Tokyo Prefecture (&quot;-fu&quot;) were opened. The extent of Tokyo Prefecture was initially limited to the former Edo city, but rapidly augmented to be comparable with the present Tokyo Metropolis. In 1878, the Meiji government&#x27;s reorganization of local governments subdivided prefectures into counties or districts (&quot;gun&quot;, further subdivided into towns and villages, later reorganized similar to Prussian districts) and districts or wards (&quot;ku&quot;) which were in ordinary prefectures cities as a whole, e.g. today&#x27;s Hiroshima City (&quot;-shi&quot;) was then &quot;Hiroshima-ku&quot;; the three major cities of Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto were each subdivided into several such wards. In Tokyo Prefecture, this created 15 wards (listed below) and six counties/districts.

In 1888, the central government created the legal framework for the current system of cities (&quot;shi&quot;) that granted some basic local autonomy rights – with some similarities to Prussia&#x27;s system of local self-government as Meiji government advisor Albert Mosse heavily influenced the organization of local government. But under a special imperial regulation, Tokyo City, like Kyoto City and Osaka City, initially did not maintain a separate mayor; instead, the (appointed) governor of Tokyo Prefecture served as mayor of Tokyo City. The Tokyo city council/assembly (&quot;Tōkyō-shikai&quot;) was first elected in May 1889. Each ward also retained its own assembly. City and prefectural government were separated in 1898., and the government began to appoint a separate mayor of Tokyo City in 1898, but retained ward-level legislation, which continues to this day in the special ward system. From 1926, the mayor was elected by the elected city council/assembly from its own ranks. The city hall of Tokyo was located in the Yūrakuchō district, on a site now occupied by the Tokyo International Forum.

Tokyo became the second-largest city in the world (population 4.9 million) upon absorbing several outlying districts in July 1932, giving the city a total of 35 wards.

In 1943, the city was abolished along with Tokyo Prefecture to form Tokyo Metropolis and Tokyo Metropolitan Government, which was functionally a part of the central government of Japan: the governor of Tokyo became a Cabinet minister reporting directly to the Prime Minister. This system remained in place until 1947 when the current structure of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government was formed.

<text>The North Caucasus, or Ciscaucasia, is a subregion in Eastern Europe governed by Russia. It constitutes the northern part of the wider Caucasus region, which separates Europe and Asia. The North Caucasus is bordered by the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea to the west, the Caspian Sea to the east, and the Caucasus Mountains to the south. The region shares land borders with the countries of Georgia and Azerbaijan in the South Caucasus. Located in the southern part of the region, Mount Elbrus is the tallest peak in Europe. Krasnodar is the most populous among the urban centres in the region.

The North Caucasus came under Russian control in the 19th century, following the Caucasian War between the Russian Empire and the various regional powers. The territory is the southernmost portion of Russia and is divided between a number of republics and krais. It is administered as part of the North Caucasian and Southern Federal Districts and consists of Krasnodar Krai, Stavropol Krai, and the constituent republics, approximately from west to east: the Republic of Adygea, Karachay-Cherkessia, Kabardino-Balkaria, North Ossetia–Alania, Ingushetia, Chechnya, and Republic of Dagestan and to the north: Kalmykia.

Geographically, the term North Caucasus also refers to the northern slope and western extremity of the Greater Caucasus mountain range, as well as a part of its southern slope to the West. The Pontic–Caspian steppe area is often also encompassed under the notion of a Ciscaucasus region, thus the northern boundary of the Forecaucasus steppe or Nogai steppe is generally considered to be the Manych River. Owing to its mild climate compared to much of Russia, the region has been described as Russia&#x27;s &quot;sunbelt&quot;.

==History==

Ancient cultures of the Northern Caucasus are known as Klin-Yar community, with one of the most notable cultures being the ancient Koban culture.

Ciscaucasus was historically covered by the Pontic–Caspian steppe, mostly on fertile calcareous chernozyom soils, which has been almost completely tilled and grazed. It is bounded by the Sea of Azov on the west, and the Caspian Sea on the east. According to the &quot;Concise Atlas of the World, Second Edition&quot; (2008), the Ciscaucasus region lies on the European side of the &quot;commonly-accepted division&quot; that separates Europe from Asia.

The Russian Empire completed the conquest of the North Caucasus by 1864. Between the 1850s and World War I, about a million North Caucasian Muslims, including Circassians, Chechens, Ingush, Ossetians, and others, became refugees in the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman government settled North Caucasian refugees in territories of modern-day Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, Iraq, Georgia, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Kosovo, Greece, Cyprus, and North Macedonia, creating a large North Caucasian diaspora.

Much of the Northern Caucasus seceded from Russia in March 1917 as the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus, taking advantage of the instability caused by the February Revolution and becoming a minor participant in the Russian Civil War. Mountainous Republic troops engaged in fierce clashes against the invading White General Anton Denikin&#x27;s Volunteer Army, before the latter&#x27;s defeat at the hands of the Red Army. The region was informally occupied by the Soviet Union shortly afterwards, and the republic was forced into accepting a nonviolent annexation in January 1921. It was reformed into the Mountainous ASSR, which was later dissolved in October 1924, replaced by a series of autonomous Okrugs and Oblasts.

The outer border of the Soviet Union&#x27;s North Caucasus Krai was the same as that of present-day North Caucasus Economic Region (Raion) which includes an oblast (Rostov Oblast), two krais (Krasnodar Krai and Stavropol Krai), and seven republics. The former North Caucasus Military District (Okrug) also included Astrakhan Oblast, Volgograd Oblast, and the Republic of Kalmykia. Its administrative center was Rostov-on-Don until 10 January 1934, Pyatigorsk until January 1936, then Ordzhonikidze (today Vladikavkaz) and, from 15 December 1936, Voroshilovsk (today Stavropol).

===Unrest===

The North Caucasus region experienced widespread unrest and insurgency after the fall of the Soviet Union, including a low-level armed conflict between Russia and militants associated with the Caucasus Emirate and, from June 2015, the Islamic State.

The insurgency became relatively dormant in its later years. During its peak, the violence was mostly concentrated in the North Caucasus republics of Chechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria. Occasional incidents happened in surrounding regions, such as North Ossetia–Alania, Karachay-Cherkessia, Stavropol Krai, and Volgograd Oblast.

While the insurgency was officially declared over on 19 December 2017 when FSB Director Alexander Bortnikov announced the final elimination of the insurgent underground in the North Caucasus, counter-terrorism operations in the North Caucasus have not ended.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
In June 2022, the US State Department advised citizens not to travel to the North Caucasus, including Chechnya and Mount Elbrus, due to terrorism, kidnapping and risk of civil unrest.

Other paramilitaries active in the region have included the Confederation of Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus, a pan-Caucasian organization that based its flag and political agenda directly on those of the Mountainous Republic.

==Economy==
The North Caucasus is considered part of peripheral Russia, and suffers from very low levels of economic development. The United States&#x27; National Intelligence Council in 2004 described the region as being dominated by corruption, weapons smuggling, and lagging economies. The main source of employment in the North Caucasus is the black market, and organized crime is powerful in local business and politics.

The Russian government has primarily focused on increasing the tourism sector in encouraging development in the North Caucasus. This strategy has proven unsuccessful, with only two percent of the region&#x27;s economy coming from tourism revenues. Primary reasons that people do not travel to the North Caucasus include poor infrastructure in the region, frequent instability and violence, and the poor image of the Caucasus in the Russian public consciousness.

==Population==
The North Caucasus, especially in its mountainous territories, has the highest life expectancy in Russia. The region is known for a large number of centenarians.

The North Caucasus is extremely ethnically and linguistically diverse, which has been a historic driver of conflict in the region. Luxembourgish politician Anne Brasseur wrote in 2004 that &quot;There is no other region in Russia or Eurasia in general in which so many peoples and ethnic groups with their various languages and cultures live together in such a small area.&quot; The local population predominantly follows Sunni Islam, with the exception of the Ossetians and Abkhazians. The western half of the North Caucasus (comprising the republics of Adygea, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, and North Ossetia) also has extant traditions of paganism, which have become closely connected to Islam. In contrast, the eastern portion of the North Caucasus (including Chechnya, Dagestan, and Ingushetia) is dominated by Sufism.

Conflicts between Islamic ethnic groups are also frequent, with battles for control over religious and political institutions often overlapping. As an example, the takeover of the Spiritual Board of Muslims of Dagestan (now the ) by Sufi tariqa sheikhs, who were predominantly ethnic Avars, led to a conflict over the board&#x27;s leadership, involving religious, ethnic, and political differences.

==Administrative divisions==

Russian political subdivisions associated with the region include:
* Mountain Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Under RSFSR)
* North Caucasian Federal District
* North Caucasian Soviet Republic
* North Caucasus economic region
* North Caucasian Krai
* North Caucasian Military District
* Southern Federal District

<doc id="482136" wikidata="Q8069637" url="?curid=482136" title="Zeroisation">
<text>In cryptography, zeroisation (also spelled zeroization) is the practice of erasing sensitive parameters (electronically stored data, cryptographic keys, and critical security parameters) from a cryptographic module to prevent their disclosure if the equipment is captured. This is generally accomplished by altering or deleting the contents to prevent recovery of the data.

==Mechanical==
When encryption was performed by mechanical devices, this would often mean changing all the machine&#x27;s settings to some fixed, meaningless value, such as zero. On machines with letter settings rather than numerals, the letter &#x27;O&#x27; was often used instead. Some machines had a button or lever for performing this process in a single step. Zeroisation would typically be performed at the end of an encryption session to prevent accidental disclosure of the keys, or immediately when there was a risk of capture by an adversary.

==Software==
In modern software based cryptographic modules, zeroisation is made considerably more complex by issues such as virtual memory, compiler optimisations and use of flash memory. Also, zeroisation may need to be applied not only to the key, but also to a plaintext and some intermediate values. A cryptographic software developer must have an intimate understanding of memory management in a machine, and be prepared to zeroise data whenever a sensitive device might move outside the security boundary. Typically this will involve overwriting the data with zeroes, but in the case of some types of non-volatile storage the process is much more complex; see &quot;data remanence&quot;.

As well as zeroising data due to memory management, software designers consider performing zeroisation:
* When an application changes mode (e.g. to a test mode) or user;
* When a computer process changes privileges;
* On termination (including abnormal termination);
* On any error condition which may indicate instability or tampering;
* Upon user request;
* Immediately, the last time the parameter is required; and
* Possibly if a parameter has not been required for some time.
Informally, software developers may also use zeroise to mean any overwriting of sensitive data, not necessarily of a cryptographic nature.

==Tamper resistant hardware==
In tamper resistant hardware, automatic zeroisation may be initiated when tampering is detected. Such hardware may be rated for cold zeroisation, the ability to zeroise itself without its normal power supply enabled.

==Standards==
Standards for zeroisation are specified in ANSI X9.17 and FIPS 140-2.

<text>A tuned radio frequency receiver (or TRF receiver) is a type of radio receiver that is composed of one or more tuned radio frequency (RF) amplifier stages followed by a detector (demodulator) circuit to extract the audio signal and usually an audio frequency amplifier. This type of receiver was popular in the 1920s. Early examples could be tedious to operate because when tuning in a station each stage had to be individually adjusted to the station&#x27;s frequency, but later models had ganged tuning, the tuning mechanisms of all stages being linked together, and operated by just one control knob. By the mid 1930s, it was replaced by the superheterodyne receiver patented by Edwin Armstrong.

== Background ==
The TRF receiver was patented in 1916 by Ernst Alexanderson. His concept was that each stage would amplify the desired signal while reducing the interfering ones. Multiple stages of RF amplification would make the radio more sensitive to weak stations, and the multiple tuned circuits would give it a narrower bandwidth and more selectivity than the single stage receivers common at that time. All tuned stages of the radio must track and tune to the desired reception frequency. This is in contrast to the modern superheterodyne receiver that must only tune the receiver&#x27;s RF front end and local oscillator to the desired frequencies; all the following stages work at a fixed frequency and do not depend on the desired reception frequency.

Antique TRF receivers can often be identified by their cabinets. They typically have a long, low appearance, with a flip-up lid for access to the vacuum tubes and tuned circuits. On their front panels there are typically two or three large dials, each controlling the tuning for one stage. Inside, along with several vacuum tubes, there will be a series of large coils. These will usually be with their axes at right angles to each other to reduce magnetic coupling between them.

A problem with the TRF receiver built with triode vacuum tubes is the triode&#x27;s interelectrode capacitance. The interelectrode capacitance allows energy in the output circuit to feedback into the input. That feedback can cause instability and oscillation that frustrate reception and produce squealing or howling noises in the speaker. In 1922, Louis Alan Hazeltine invented the technique of &quot;neutralization&quot; that uses additional circuitry to partially cancel the effect of the interelectrode capacitance. Neutralization was used in the popular Neutrodyne series of TRF receivers. Under certain conditions, &quot;the neutralization is substantially independent of frequency over a wide frequency band.&quot; &quot;Perfect neutralization cannot be maintained in practice over a wide band of frequencies because leakage inductances and stray capacities&quot; are not completely canceled. The later development of the tetrode and pentode vacuum tubes minimized the effect of interelectrode capacitances and could make neutralization unnecessary; the additional electrodes in those tubes shield the plate and grid and minimize feedback.

== How it works ==
The classic TRF receivers of the 1920s and 30s usually consisted of three sections: 
*one or more tuned RF amplifier stages. These amplify the signal of the desired station to a level sufficient to drive the detector, while rejecting all other signals picked up by the antenna.
*a detector, which extracts the audio (modulation) signal from the radio carrier signal by rectifying it. 
*&quot;optionally&quot;, but almost always included, one or more audio amplifier stages which increase the power of the audio signal.

Each tuned RF stage consists of an amplifying device, a triode (or in later sets a tetrode) vacuum tube, and a tuned circuit which performs the filtering function. The tuned circuit consisted of an air-core RF coupling transformer which also served to couple the signal from the plate circuit of one tube to the input grid circuit of the next tube. One of the windings of the transformer had a variable capacitor connected across it to make a tuned circuit. A variable capacitor (or sometimes a variable coupling coil called a &quot;variometer&quot;) was used, with a knob on the front panel to tune the receiver. The RF stages usually had identical circuits to simplify design.

Each RF stage had to be tuned to the same frequency, so the capacitors had to be tuned in tandem when bringing in a new station. In some later sets the capacitors were &quot;ganged&quot;, mounted on the same shaft or otherwise linked mechanically so that the radio could be tuned with a single knob, but in most sets the resonant frequencies of the tuned circuits could not be made to &quot;track&quot; well enough to allow this, and each stage had its own tuning knob.

The detector was usually a grid-leak detector. Some sets used a crystal detector (semiconductor diode) instead. Occasionally, a regenerative detector was used, to increase selectivity.

Some TRF sets that were listened to with earphones didn&#x27;t need an audio amplifier, but most sets had one to three transformer-coupled or RC-coupled audio amplifier stages to provide enough power to drive a loudspeaker.

The schematic diagram shows a typical TRF receiver. This particular example uses six triodes. It has two radio frequency amplifier stages, one grid-leak detector/amplifier and three class ‘A’ audio amplifier stages. There are 3 tuned circuits &quot;T1-C1, T2-C2, and T3-C3&quot;. The second and third tuning capacitors, &quot;C2&quot; and &quot;C3&quot;, are ganged together &quot;(indicated by line linking them)&quot; and controlled by a single knob, to simplify tuning. Generally, two or three RF amplifiers were required to filter and amplify the received signal enough for good reception.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Terman characterizes the TRF&#x27;s disadvantages as &quot;poor selectivity and low sensitivity in proportion to the number of tubes employed. They are accordingly practically obsolete.&quot; Selectivity requires narrow bandwidth, but the bandwidth of a filter with a given Q factor increases with frequency. So to achieve a narrow bandwidth at a high radio frequency required high-Q filters or many filter sections. Achieving constant sensitivity and bandwidth across an entire broadcast band was rarely achieved. In contrast, a superheterodyne receiver translates the incoming high radio frequency to a lower intermediate frequency which does not change. The problem of achieving constant sensitivity and bandwidth over a range of frequencies arises only in one circuit (the first stage) and is therefore considerably simplified.

The major problem with the TRF receiver, particularly as a consumer product, was its complicated tuning. All the tuned circuits need to track to keep the narrow bandwidth tuning. Keeping multiple tuned circuits aligned while tuning over a wide frequency range is difficult. In the early TRF sets the operator had to perform that task, as described above. A superheterodyne receiver only needs to track the RF and LO stages; the onerous selectivity requirements are confined to the IF amplifier which is fixed-tuned.

During the 1920s, an advantage of the TRF receiver over the regenerative receiver was that, when properly adjusted, it did not radiate interference. The popular regenerative receiver, in particular, used a tube with positive feedback operated very close to its oscillation point, so it often acted as a transmitter, emitting a signal at a frequency near the frequency of the station it was tuned to. This produced audible heterodynes, shrieks and howls, in other nearby receivers tuned to the same frequency, bringing criticism from neighbors. In an urban setting, when several regenerative sets in the same block or apartment house were tuned to a popular station, it could be virtually impossible to hear. Britain, and eventually the US, passed regulations that prohibited receivers from radiating spurious signals, which favored the TRF.

==Modern usage==
Although the TRF design has been largely superseded by the superheterodyne receiver, with the advent of semiconductor electronics in the 1960s the design was &quot;resurrected&quot; and used in some simple integrated radio receivers for hobbyist radio projects, kits, and low-end consumer products. One example is the ZN414 TRF radio integrated circuit from Ferranti in 1972 shown below

<text>A shadoof or shaduf, well pole, well sweep, sweep, swape, or simply a lift is a tool that is used to lift water from a well or another water source onto land or into another waterway or basin. It is highly efficient, and has been known since 3000 BCE.

The mechanism of a shadoof comprises a long counterbalanced pole on a pivot, with a bucket attached to the end of it. It is generally used in a crop irrigation system using basins, dikes, ditches, walls, canals, and similar waterways.

== History ==
One theory states that the shadoof was invented in prehistoric times in Mesopotamia as early as the time of Sargon of Akkad (around 24th and 23rd centuries BCE). The earliest evidence of this technology is a cylindrical seal with a depiction of a shadoof dating back to about 2200 BCE. Then, it is believed that the Minoans adopted this technology; evidence suggests the use of shadoofs as early as around 2100–1600 BCE. The shadoof appeared in Upper Egypt sometime after 2000 BC, most likely during the 18th Dynasty. Around the same time, the shadoof reached China.

Some historians believe the Egyptians were the original inventors of the shadoof. The theory states that the shadoof originated along the Nile, using tomb drawings illustrating shadoofs at Thebes dating from 1250 BCE as evidence.

An alternative origin theory states that shadoof originated from India around the same time as in Mesopotamia. This theory owes to the fact that the shadoof was well spread in India; however, there is little to no other evidence that makes this theory any stronger.

It is still used in many areas of Africa and Asia and is very common in rural areas of India and Pakistan, such as the Bhojpuri belt of the Ganges plain. In Europe, they remain common in Germany and Hungary&#x27;s Great Plain, where they are considered a symbol of the region. They are also well widespread throughout Eastern Europe in countries like Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic states.

== Design, construction, and efficiency ==
The shadoof is easy to construct and is highly efficient in use. It consists of an upright frame on which is suspended a long pole or branch, at a distance of about one-fifth of its length from one end. At the long end of this pole hangs a bucket, skin bag, or bitumen-coated reed basket. The bucket can be made in many different styles, sometimes having an uneven base or a part at the top of the skin that can be untied. This allows the water to be immediately distributed rather than manually emptied. The short end carries a weight made of clay, stone, or a similar material, which serves as the counterpoise of a lever. The bucket can be lowered by the operator using their own weight to push it down; the counterweight then raises the full bucket without effort.

The implementations vary from region to region. The frame can consist of a single pole or a pair, and the buckets can be attached in multiple different ways, from being tied to a rope to being attached to a thinner stick.

With an almost effortless swinging and lifting motion, the waterproof vessel can be used to scoop up and carry water from a body of water (typically, a river or pond) onto land or to another body of water. At the end of each movement, the water is emptied out into runnels that convey the water along irrigation ditches in the required direction. The device is capable of lowering the force levels required of operators to the extent that the performance tends to be limited by the energy processing capacity of the operator and not necessarily muscle fatigue.

The shadoof has a lifting range of 1 to 6 meters. A study of efficiency in various sites in Chad has shown that one man can lift 39 to 130 liters per minute over heights of 1.8 to 6.2 m, resulting in water-lifting power levels of 26.7 to 60.1 W. Its efficiency has been calculated at 60%.

A study done in Nigeria also indirectly assessed energy usage through heart rate, serving as the physiological metric. Through this approach, it was discovered that making suitable adjustments to the shadoof decreased energy consumption from approximately 109 to 71 watts (equivalent to 6.56 to 4.27 kilojoules per minute). This reduction enables a farmer to engage in prolonged work without necessitating frequent rest breaks.

== Social effects ==
Across numerous cultures, shadoofs have symbolized collective effort. In ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, for instance, the multi-tiered shadoof systems allowed the movement of water to higher levels through teamwork. Together with other irrigation technologies, shadoofs not only helped establish reliable methods of agriculture for growing civilizations but also influenced cultural elements.

The accessibility and utilization of shadoofs have been linked to class. During the Egyptian Middle Empire and the New Kingdom, pleasure gardens featuring shadoof irrigation became a hallmark of luxury residences and consequently a status symbol. Although not directly, shadoofs contributed to creating a class system, a barrier for some. At the same time, shadoofs have remained essential for those with limited resources to support their livelihoods on large-scale farms around the Nile. Even in the present day, many communities worldwide lack access to more sophisticated water technologies, making shadoofs an indicator of socio-economic standing and a certain measure of societal development. The technology&#x27;s reliability, despite its antiquity, often gets overlooked.

The geographic spread of shadoofs is impressive. In regions where irrigation is imperative, such as Egypt, India, and parts of sub-Saharan Africa, shadoofs have played a crucial role in enabling agriculture to thrive in water-scarce areas. Shadoofs have empowered marginalized communities by providing them with the means to secure their sustenance, breaking the barrier of food insecurity even in the modern age.

Gender roles have also undergone a transformation, with women frequently assuming shadoof operation. The ease of use of the shadoof empowered women to play a more active role in farming. It is fair to acknowledge that shadoofs contributed to normalizing women&#x27;s increased independence and participation in less physically demanding, and therefore more “socially acceptable”, aspects of food production.

The ease of use of the shadoof is perhaps its most important feature. Studies have shown that it is impressively efficient, given the simplicity of its design. Still, it is essential to recognize that shadoofs, while easing the physical demands of water retrieval, require manual labor, posing a barrier for individuals with certain physical disabilities.

<doc id="482158" wikidata="Q7639452" url="?curid=482158" title="Sunday Mirror">
<text>The Sunday Mirror is the Sunday sister paper of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. It began life in 1915 as the Sunday Pictorial and was renamed the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; in 1963. In 2016 it had an average weekly circulation of 620,861, dropping markedly to 505,508 the following year. Competing closely with other papers, in July 2011, on the second weekend after the closure of the &quot;News of the World&quot;, more than 2,000,000 copies sold, the highest level since January 2000.

==History==
===&quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot; (1915–1963)===
The paper launched as the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot; on 14 March 1915.

Lord Rothermere – who owned the paper – introduced the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot; to the British public with the idea of striking a balance between socially responsible reporting of great issues of the day and sheer entertainment.

Although the newspaper has gone through many refinements in its near 100-year history those original core values are still in place today.

Ever since 1915, the paper has continually published the best and most revealing pictures of the famous and the infamous, and reported on major national and international events.

The first editor of the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot;, or the &quot;Sunday Pic&quot; as it was commonly known, was F.R Sanderson.

His launch edition led with three stories on the front page, two of which reported from the front line of the war: &quot;THE TASK OF THE RED CROSS&quot; and &quot;ALL THAT WAS LEFT OF A BIG GUN&quot;.

From day one the paper was a huge success and within six months of launch the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot; was selling more than one million copies.

One of the reasons for this early success was due to a series of articles written by Winston Churchill. In 1915, Churchill, disillusioned with government, resigned from the Cabinet. The articles he then wrote for the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot; attracted such high levels of interest that sales lifted by 400,000 copies every time his stories appeared.

A further reason for the paper&#x27;s success was its political influence. As a popular paper that always spoke its mind, the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot; struck a chord with millions.

Sport was also a key ingredient of the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot;&#x27;s success. Football, even then, made it onto the front pages, and for many of the same reasons it does today: &quot;WEMBLEY STADIUM STORMED BY EXCITED CUP FINAL CROWDS&quot; dominates a front page from 1923.

Although the paper&#x27;s early life started with a flourish, by the mid-1930s its success began to flounder. That, however, all changed when the editorship was given to 24-year-old Hugh Cudlipp in 1937. Within three years of taking over he saw the circulation of the paper rise to more than 1,700,000 by the time he went to fight in World War II in 1940.

On resuming the editorship in 1946, Cudlipp successfully developed the &quot;Sunday Pic&quot; to reflect the greater social awareness of the post-war years. In all, Cudlipp edited the title for three long spells. After his final editorship in 1953 he became editor-in-chief and then editorial director of Mirror Group, where he pushed the daily title, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, to a circulation in excess of five million copies.

===&quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; (1963 to date)===
In 1963 the newspaper&#x27;s name was changed to the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;.

One of the earliest stories covered by the newly named paper was the Profumo affair, which was catastrophic for the government of the day. While frontbenchers involved in sleaze scandals exposed in the British press have often led to reshuffles, contemporary accounts and later research has credited the coverage, associating the involved young socialite to a Russian senior attaché, for triggering the replacement of the Conservative prime minister with another, Alec Douglas-Home. This leader was less popular, and alongside many press reports of scandals in the Macmillan Ministry, this led to the party&#x27;s election defeat of 1964 and to the establishment of the second Labour government after World War II led by two-time prime minister Harold Wilson.

In 1974, following a succession of editors, Robert Edwards took the chair and within a year, circulation rose to 5.3 million. Edwards remained for a record 13 years, and ended as deputy chairman of Mirror Group in 1985.

By the end of his time in charge Edwards oversaw the introduction of colour to the paper (in 1988). The paper also introduced the &quot;Sunday Mirror Magazine&quot; which had an extra-large format and was printed on glossy paper. It had the best of big name stories, star photographs, money-saving offers and glittering prizes for competition winners. Today&#x27;s incarnation of the magazine is &quot;Notebook&quot;.

In 1992 the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; was criticised and challenged by attorneys of Mel Gibson for reporting what was said in confidential Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.

In 2001 Tina Weaver was appointed editor of the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;, a position she held for 11 years until her sacking. Since its launch the paper has had 25 editors in total including current editor-in-chief Lloyd Embley.

In 2012 the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; broke the world exclusive that one of the two Moors murderers, Ian Brady, had died but been resuscitated, brought back to life against his will.

The &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; also ran a campaign to make Twitter take action to prevent paedophiles using it to contact each other and trade obscene pictures. As a result of this story and others, Twitter agreed to make changes to its policies.

A former &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; investigations editor, Graham Johnson, pleaded guilty to intercepting voicemail messages in 2001. Johnson is the first Mirror Group Newspapers journalist to admit to phone hacking. He voluntarily contacted police in 2013.

<doc id="482161" wikidata="Q1433199" url="?curid=482161" title="Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis">
<text>Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) was a public research university in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. It was a collaboration between Indiana University and Purdue University that offered undergraduate, graduate, and professional degrees from both universities. Administered primarily through Indiana University as a core campus and secondarily through Purdue University as a regional campus, it was Indiana&#x27;s primary urban research and academic health sciences institution. IUPUI was located in downtown Indianapolis along the White River and Fall Creek.

Among more than 550 degree programs, the urban university hosted the primary campuses for both the Indiana University School of Medicine, with more than 2,000 students, and the Indiana University School of Dentistry, the only dental school in the state. Also, the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law is one of the two Indiana University law schools. After excluding the research budget of the IU School of Medicine, IUPUI was classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity.&quot;

The IUPUI Jaguars competed in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I in the Horizon League. Several athletics venues are located on the campus, including the IU Michael A. Carroll Track &amp; Soccer Stadium and Indiana University Natatorium, the largest indoor pool in the United States with a seating capacity of 4,700.

On August 12, 2022, the boards of trustees of both Purdue and IU announced that IUPUI would split into two separate universities, Indiana University Indianapolis and Purdue University in Indianapolis. The split was finalized on July 1, 2024. The IUPUI athletic program was transferred to the new IU Indianapolis as the IU Indy Jaguars, inheriting IUPUI&#x27;s memberships in Division I and the Horizon League.

==History==

=== Founding ===
In 1968, Maynard K. Hine, dean of the IU School of Dentistry began working with then-Mayor of Indianapolis Richard Lugar, IU President Joseph L. Sutton, Purdue President Frederick L. Hovde, and others to establish IUPUI in 1969 through the merger of the Indianapolis extension programs of both IU and Purdue. Some schools, however, were established before the merger, including the IU School of Medicine, IU School of Dentistry, IU Robert H. McKinney School of Law, IU School of Liberal Arts, and IU Herron School of Art.

The student-run newspaper of the former IU extension campus, the &quot;Onomatopoeia&quot;, and that of the former Purdue University extension campus, the &quot;Component&quot;, merged in 1971 to form &quot;The Sagamore&quot;, which operated until 2009. Archives are available online. That publication was replaced by &quot;The Campus Citizen&quot; in 2011. A second student newspaper known as &quot;The Collegiate Commons&quot; was formed in 2023&quot;.&quot; It is a Christian publication and is part of the Collegiate Network.

=== Later history ===
IUPUI&#x27;s research expenditures for fiscal year 2014 totaled $271,093,483 with the federal government as the largest sponsor of the research at 61 percent of the total. 

IUPUI CyberLab, a lab in the School of Engineering and Technology that provides research and intellectual support for the design, development, and implementation of innovative educational technology, was established in 1996 by Ali Jafari and funded by William Plater, the Executive Vice-Chancellor of IUPUI at the time. Ali Jafari, David Mills, Brian Ho, and Amy Warner was the first team at the CyberLab to start working on the development of the very first online (based on the Internet) on an Indiana University campus. The team received $160,000 from Indiana University to continue to implement Oncourse for all courses at IUPUI. Starting in 1998, Indiana University - Purdue University was the first IU campus to put all courses online. The CyberLab continued to develop and has now launched several projects, including; Sakai, ANGEL Learning, Epsilen, and the current project called CourseNetworking.

In 2012, the Indiana Commission for Higher Education approved IU&#x27;s proposal to create what is believed to be the world&#x27;s first school dedicated to the study and teaching of philanthropy. The school has built on the strengths of the Center of Philanthropy at IU, a pioneer in philanthropy education, research and training. In 2013, the School was named the Indiana University Lilly School of Philanthropy in honor of the Lilly family&#x27;s philanthropic leadership, as well as their profound contributions to education, research, and the well-being of society. Dr. Gene Tempel was named founding dean of the school.

In 2013, IUPUI opened a School of Public Health named in honor of Richard M. Fairbanks. The Indiana University Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health will focus on the areas of urban health, health policy, biostatistics, and epidemiology. Paul K. Halverson was named founding dean of the school.

The Office of Sustainability developed an IUPUI Sustainability Certificate for students.

=== Split ===

On August 12, 2022, the boards of trustees of both Purdue and IU announced that IUPUI would split into two separate universities, with completion of the split finished by the fall 2024 semester. The School of Science is now operated by IU along with its other programs, including business, law, nursing, and social work under Indiana University Indianapolis. The computer science, engineering, and technology programs are now operated by Purdue as the new Purdue University in Indianapolis, a fully integrated extension of its West Lafayette campus. IU added a new computer science programs to its School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering, and Purdue intends to open a branch of its applied research institute on or near the IUPUI campus, and plans to house several other programs in various locations throughout Indianapolis. IU will provide certain administrative services to both academic organizations, and the IUPUI athletic program will transfer to the new IU Indianapolis.

In 2023, Purdue University created a separate tenure system called &quot;University Tenure&quot; for the IUPUI faculty affected by the split, which gave rise to concerns about unequal treatment and potential discrimination. The IUPUI Faculty Council said that IU President Pamela Whitten and Board of Trustees &quot;undermined&quot; shared governance.

==Academics==

IUPUI was one of nine campuses of Indiana University and one of five campuses of the Purdue University system. The campus offered more than 550 degree programs provided by 17 different schools, two of which are Purdue University schools.

IUPUI had more than 3,800 full-time faculty members. With research funding of more than $629 million in 2024, IUPUI was the second-largest site for research in Indiana.

IUPUI included the nation&#x27;s largest nursing school, the main campus of the largest medical school in the country, the only dental school in the state, and the country&#x27;s oldest school of physical education. IUPUI was among the top 20 campuses in the nation for graduate professional degrees conferred.

IUPUI was primarily governed by the IU Board of Trustees. Purdue University degree-granting programs were governed by the Purdue University Board of Trustees. While integrated into the Indiana University system budget, IUPUI was semi-autonomous in that it retains some independent control of its own academic curricula.

IUPUI had been accredited by the Higher Learning Commission since 1972.

==Indiana University–Purdue University Columbus (IUPUC)==

Closely affiliated with IUPUI, Indiana University–Purdue University Columbus was established in 1970 and is located one hour south of Indianapolis in Columbus, Indiana—an area known for its collection of modern architecture with an estimated population of more than 45,000. The growing campus serves more than 1,700 undergraduate and graduate students who live primarily in Bartholomew, Brown, Decatur, Jennings Jackson, Johnson, Ripley, and Shelby counties and offers a broad range of undergraduate degree programs in business, communication studies, elementary education, English, general studies, mechanical engineering, nursing, psychology, and sociology, as well as two graduate degree programs – Master of Business Administration and Master of Arts in Mental Health Counseling. IUPUC is administered through IUPUI as a regional campus.

By July 1, 2024, IUPUC transitioned completely to Indiana University Columbus (IUC) and is now administered through IU Indianapolis. The only two Purdue degree-granting programs at IUPUC were biology and mechanical engineering; the biology degree continues to be offered at IUC through Indiana University, but the engineering degree was discontinued.

<doc id="482163" wikidata="Q1265328" url="?curid=482163" title="Dunbrody Abbey">
<text>Dunbrody Abbey () is a former Cistercian monastery in County Wexford, Ireland. The cross-shaped church was built in the 13th century, and the tower was added in the 15th century. With a length of 59m the church was one of the longest in Ireland. The visitor centre is run by the current Marquess of Donegall and has one of only two full sized hedge mazes in Ireland.

The abbey was dissolved under Henry VIII. The last Abbot of Dunbrody was Alexander Devereux, who became Bishop of Ferns in 1539.

== History ==
In 1169 a contingent of Anglo-Norman knights led by the King of Leinster, Dermot MacMurrough, invaded Ireland, first conquering the Irish province of Leinster then all of Ireland. In 1171 Henry II led a much larger force into Ireland, taking control and making Ireland a territory of England. Richard de Clare, one of the important figures in the Norman Conquest, instructed his uncle Herve de Montmorency to found a Cistercian monastery in the County Wexford. Montmorency donated the allotted land to the English Cistercian Abbey of Buildwas. The Abbey of Buildwas sent a lay brother to survey the land and, after an unfavorable report, Buildwas turned down the gift. The property was then offered to St. Mary’s Cistercian Abbey in Dublin, which was in the filial line of Clairvaux. The monks of St. Mary’s were delighted with their new land and they soon sent a community to the site in 1182. Due to its position near a major maritime transportation route, the abbey was placed under the patronage of the Blessed Virgin Mary, with the name Port of St. Mary’s, because of the safety the abbey offered to people in trouble.

The middle of the 13th century was a boom period for the Anglo-Norman colony in Ireland and the Cistercian order shared in this prosperity. The scale and quality of the 13th century buildings constructed at Dunbrody gives a general hint of confidence and well being. The spacious early Gothic church was built sometime around 1210–1240 for the monks of Dunbrody Abbey. Dunbrody, though a relatively small abbey, was very successful until the 16th century and the rise of King Henry VIII. Following his split with the Church of Rome, Henry VIII issued the Dissolution of the Monasteries through a series of administrative and legal processes between 1536 and 1541. Dunbrody was part of the first round of suppressions in Ireland and was officially dissolved in 1536. The abbey was plundered and made unfit for monks to return. The lead from the roof was melted down by using the wood from the roof. Nine years later, Sir Osborne Ichyngham was given the land and the monastery which he converted into a residence. Owing to the neglect of the private owners of Dunbrody, a massive collapse occurred on Christmas Eve 1852, destroying the south wall of the church and some of the monastery. The abbey lies in ruins until this day.

==Architecture==

The church is in the form of a cross on plan, as is usual in Cistercian Abbeys, and has a nave, side aisles, north and south transepts, and choir. Apartments were formed in the roof over the chapels in the transepts (each transept has three chapels), one over the north transept (left transept on the plan) was approached by the circular stairs and a passage across the triforium of the north transept. There is also evidence of a floor having at one time been carried over the whole of the north transept. The space over the side chapels of the south transept contained a fireplace and five windows, and over it another floor, probably divided into two apartments, as it contains two fireplaces and has also five windows.
The nave was separated from the aisles by an arcade of five bays. In the north aisle are four large buttresses; it is entirely owing to these buttresses that this wall is preserved. The south arcade and the wall of the south aisle fell in a storm on Christmas Eve 1852. The nave was lit by a row of clerestory windows and also three lights that formed the large west window.

A very remarkable feature is shown in the construction of the bell tower. The rules of the Order did not originally permit the erection of a tower, but this prohibition was later removed. In many other similar structures the original transept arches have been used to carry the walls of a tower, however in this case the old arches were not built upon, but new piers were built alongside the old, and new arches were formed at the nave and choir, and in this way the stability of the tower was secured. 
There were seven bells in the tower plan, indicated by the seven openings for the bell ropes to the ringing chamber through the vault carrying the floor of the tower. There was also a large opening square through which the bells were hoisted.

The range of buildings east of the cloister garth and south of the church comprises the sacristy and an inner room opening off it. There is here a small apartment with a door giving access from the cloister walk. This apartment, which is usually found in monasteries of this Order, is sometimes described as a prison, but is more likely to have been the book store, a convenient place for keeping books to read in the cloisters. There were several more apartments southwards including the parlour and chapter room, and over the whole of this range the dormitories extended, approached by the night stairs in the south transept, and at the other end by the stairs in the passage at the south-east angle of the cloister enclosure.

In the southern range of buildings there is evidence of the position of the refectory by the indication of the reader&#x27;s desk at one of the windows in south side wall. Although this range is not now divided by cross walls, it is likely that the eastern end was occupied by the calefactory, or warming house, and the western end by the butteries and kitchen. Excavation in the cloister garth has revealed the foundations of the lavabo, occupying the usual position near the door of the refectory.

==Present day==
Osborne Ichyngham&#x27;s great-great-grandson, John, built Dunbrody Castle, a fortified house, but it was never fully completed. His daughter Jane, married Arthur Chichester, 2nd Earl of Donegall, and so the property came into the Chichester family. The premises has a visitor centre opened by the Earl of Belfast, with brochures from area tourist attractions and services, and a craft shop.

<text>The University of Louisiana at Monroe (ULM) is a public university in Monroe, Louisiana. It is part of the University of Louisiana System.

==History==
ULM opened in 1931 as Ouachita Parish Junior College. Three years later it became the Northeast Center of Louisiana State University. In 1936 and 1937, its dean was Stephen A. Caldwell.

Its name changed again in 1949, to Northeast Junior College of Louisiana State University. A year later, it became an autonomous four-year institution as Northeast Louisiana State College. In 1969, it granted doctoral degrees for the first time and was elevated to university status as Northeast Louisiana University (NLU).

In 1999, NLU, in conjuction with the University of Southwestern Louisiana wanting to rebrand to have a university with &quot;Of Louisiana&quot; in the title, agreed to rebrand, as agreed on by university president Lawson Swearingen. As such, it was changed so that both schools would include &quot;of Louisiana&quot; in their name to go along with a geographical indicator to reflect a state law that allowed the change if two schools agreed to it.

===21st century===

A 2002 &quot;Reclaim Our Campus&quot; effort targeted recovery from financial and auditing difficulties.

In 2010, James Erwin Cofer Sr., left the ULM presidency after eight years to head Missouri State University in Springfield, Missouri. He was succeeded by Nick Bruno as the eighth president of ULM.

Established in 1956, the College of Pharmacy is accredited by the American Council on Pharmacy Education, including one of seven Toxicology programs in the U.S. In 2007, the College of Pharmacy moved from the main campus to the off-campus (Bienville) building. There are satellite campuses in Shreveport and Baton Rouge.

The College of Pharmacy at ULM is Louisiana&#x27;s only publicly supported comprehensive center for pharmaceutical education, research, and service. The college includes several modern specialized instructional and health service facilities and numerous affiliated off-campus teaching hospitals and pharmacies throughout the state.

In 1999, Milburn E. Calhoun, a New Orleans physician, philanthropist, and Pelican Books publisher endowed the million-dollar Mary E. and Darrell L. Calhoun Chair in Pharmacology, named for his late parents.

===Theater Arts===
ULM is home to the Emy-Lou Biedenharn Recital Hall, named for the opera singer and daughter of the Coca-Cola entrepreneur Joseph A. Biedenharn.

===Natural History Museum===
The university&#x27;s Natural History Museum was home to the 6-million-specimen Neil Douglas fish collection and the 500,000-specimen R. Dale Thomas plant collection. In March 2017, museum staff announced that they had been told the collections would have to be divested to enable an expansion of the university&#x27;s stadium, and that any specimens which had not been relocated to other institutions by July 2017 would be destroyed. The specimens were subsequently distributed to other institutions, with the plant collection going to the Botanical Research Institute of Texas, the herpetological collection to the University of Texas at Arlington, the entomological collection to Mississippi State University, and the ichthyological collection to Tulane University.

===Major sports===
Teams participate in NCAA Division I (Division I FBS for football). ULM joined the Sun Belt Conference for all sports on July 1, 2006, after playing in the Southland Conference in all sports except football (swimming and diving team was in Sun Belt Conference, but was dropped in 2005). The school&#x27;s sports teams previously competed as the Indians until 2006.

ULM moved from Division I-AA (now Division I FCS) to Division I-A (now FBS) in 1994 and played as a I-A independent 1994–2000. It became a football-only Sun Belt Conference member in 2001 and joined as a member in all sports in 2006. ULM shared the 2005 Sun Belt Conference football championship with Arkansas State University and the University of Louisiana–Lafayette (ASU received the conference&#x27;s New Orleans Bowl bid due to tiebreaking procedures). Also, in 2012, ULM had their first winning season as an FBS school going, 8–5, and a bid to the 2012 Independence Bowl in Shreveport vs. the Ohio Bobcats, but lost 45–14.

ULM basketball coaches have included Arnold R. Kilpatrick, Lenny Fant, and Mike Vining. Fant was the first ULM coach to win three hundred games. Current head coach Keith Richard is a former point guard and alumnus from ULM.

Since being in the Sun Belt, the Warhawks have won conference titles in men&#x27;s basketball (2006–07 West Co-Champion) and baseball (2008 regular season and 2012 conference tournament).

The ULM football team posted its first six-win season since moving to Division I-A in 2007 going 6–6, which included a 21–14 victory at Alabama. On September 8, 2012, ULM beat number 8 Arkansas 34–31 in overtime to become the first Sun Belt Conference team to beat a top ten SEC team. This was their second ever win against a ranked opponent after defeating number 20 Richmond 14–8 in Monroe in 1973.

The football and baseball stadiums and ULM Activities Center were designed by architect Hugh G. Parker of Bastrop.

===Other activities===
ULM is home to several award-winning groups including the Sound of Today marching band and the competition cheerleading squad.

The ULM water ski team is the most successful in the history of the collegiate sport, having won 28 National Collegiate Water Skiing Association championships since 1979. In that year, Bayou Desiard was the host site of the national competition.

<doc id="482166" wikidata="Q814068" url="?curid=482166" title="Beep (sound)">
<text>A beep is a short, single tone, typically high-pitched, generally made by a computer or other machine. The term has its origin in onomatopoeia. The word &quot;beep-beep&quot; is recorded for the noise of a car horn in 1929, and the modern usage of &quot;beep&quot; for a high-pitched tone is attributed to Arthur C. Clarke in 1951.

==Use in computers==
In some computer terminals, the ASCII character code 7, bell character, outputs an audible beep. The beep is also sometimes used to notify the user when the BIOS is not working or there is some other error during the start up process, often during the power-on self-test (POST). A beep is also made when holding down too many keys at the same time, as the computer often cannot handle the processes.
The command-line interfaces of the ReactOS, PTS-DOS, SISNE plus, and AROS operating systems include a codice_1 command.
A codice_1 command is also part of ASCII&#x27;s &quot;MSX-DOS2 Tools&quot; for MSX-DOS version 2.

==Use in transport==
Beeps are also used as a warning when a truck, lorry or bus is reversing. It can also be used to define the sound produced by a car horn. Colloquially, beep is also used to refer to the action of honking the car horn at someone, (e.g., &quot;Why did that guy beep at me?&quot;), and is more likely to be used with vehicles with higher-pitched horns. &quot;Honk&quot; is used if the sound is lower pitched (e.g. Volkswagen Beetles beep, but Oldsmobiles honk. On trains, beeps may be used for communications between members of staff.

==Use in telecommunication==
===Call waiting===
A beep is also a colloquialism for a zip tone to indicate a telephone call coming in on the same phone line as someone is currently speaking, either on a landline or mobile phone. The call waiting feature often outputs an audible &quot;beep&quot; noise to indicate that there is a second call coming in.

===Paging===
The electronic pager is often referred to as a &quot;beeper&quot; for the sound it emits to alert its owner to an incoming message.

===Call back request===
As a noun, the practice of &quot;beeping&quot; in sub-Saharan Africa refers to the cell phone phenomenon during which a person dials a number but immediately cancels the call before it is answered in order to elicit a call back from the recipient. One reason for this practice is to elicit a recipient to call back when the caller has almost run out of prepaid units for his/her cell phone but still wants or needs to talk to the recipient. In Rwanda, this practice has evolved into an art for courting between men and women, where women &quot;beep&quot; males in order to elicit a call back, which manifests the man&#x27;s interest and willingness to pay for the woman&#x27;s call. At times, this practice can be an inconvenience for the recipient, and at times, people ignore the &quot;beeps.&quot; &quot;Beeping&quot; is also known as &quot;flashing&quot; in sub Saharan Africa, and is known as &quot;menacing&quot; or &quot;fishing&quot; in Indonesia.

==Censorship==

The use of profanity and offensive language on free-to-air broadcasts in the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Japan is sometimes censored by replacing the profane word or phrase with an audible beep(s), often accompanied by obscuring the speaker&#x27;s mouth to prevent lip-reading. If there is a closed captioning, the word is commonly replaced by asterisks, used as a mixture of letters and asterisks, or &quot;[bleep]&quot; is used.

<doc id="482175" wikidata="Q473022" url="?curid=482175" title="Ginglymostomatidae">
<text>The Ginglymostomatidae are a cosmopolitan family of carpet sharks known as nurse sharks, containing four species in three genera. Common in shallow, tropical and subtropical waters, these sharks are sluggish and docile bottom-dwellers. They are the most abundant species of shark found in shallow coastal waters. Nurse sharks typically attack humans only if directly threatened.

The name nurse shark is thought to be a corruption of &quot;nusse&quot;, a name which once referred to the catsharks of the family Scyliorhinidae. The nurse shark family name, Ginglymostomatidae, derives from the Greek words &quot;ginglymos&quot; () meaning &quot;hinge&quot; and &quot;stoma&quot; () meaning &quot;mouth&quot;.

== Description ==
The largest species, called simply the nurse shark &quot;Ginglymostoma cirratum&quot;, may reach a length of ; the tawny nurse shark &quot;Nebrius ferrugineus&quot; is somewhat smaller at , and the short-tail nurse shark &quot;Pseudoginglymostoma brevicaudatum&quot; is by far the smallest at just in length. The first of the three species may reach a weight of 110 kg. Yellowish to dark brown in colour, nurse sharks have muscular pectoral fins, two spineless dorsal fins (the second of which is smaller) in line with the pelvic and anal fins, and a tail exceeding one quarter the shark&#x27;s body length.

The mouth of nurse sharks is most distinctive; it is far ahead of the eyes and before the snout (subterminal), an indication of the bottom-dwelling (benthic) nature of these sharks. Also present on the lower jaw are two fleshy barbels, chemosensory organs which help the nurse sharks find prey hidden in the sediments. Behind each eye is a very small, circular opening called a spiracle, part of the shark&#x27;s respiratory system. The serrated teeth are fan-shaped and independent; like other sharks, the teeth are continually replaced throughout the animal&#x27;s life.

== Habits ==
Nurse sharks are nocturnal animals, spending the day in large inactive groups of up to 40 individuals. Hidden under submerged ledges or in crevices within the reef, the nurse sharks seem to prefer specific haunts and will return to them every day. By night, the sharks are largely solitary; they spend most of their time searching through the bottom sediments in search of food. Their diet consists primarily of crustaceans, molluscs, tunicates, and other fish, particularly stingrays.

Nurse sharks are thought to take advantage of dormant fish which would otherwise be too fast for the sharks to catch; although their small mouths limit the size of prey items, the sharks&#x27; large throat cavities are used as a sort of bellows valve. In this way, nurse sharks are able to suck in their prey. Nurse sharks are also known to graze algae and coral.

== Reproduction ==
The mating season runs from late June to the end of July. All nurse sharks are aplacental viviparous, meaning the eggs develop and hatch within the body of the female, where the hatchlings develop further until live birth occurs. The gestation period is six months, with a typical litter of 30–40 pups. The mating cycle is biennial, as it takes 18 months for the female&#x27;s ovaries to produce another batch of eggs. The young nurse sharks are born fully developed at about 30 cm long in &quot;Ginglymostoma cirratum&quot;. They possess a spotted coloration that fades with age.

<text>was a Japanese government entity that existed between 1868 and 1943.

==History==

When the prefecture was established with the merger of the two shogunate city administrations in the Meiji restoration in 1868, Tokyo initially consisted only of the former city area of the shogunate capital Edo. Beginning in 1871, the territory of Tokyo was expanded beyond Edo in several steps to reach roughly its present extent with the Tama transfer in 1893. The surrounding former shogunate domain (incl. hatamoto fiefs) in Musashi province was initially administered by Musashi governors, but then split up between the prefectures Shinagawa, Kosuge and Ōmiya/Urawa. In 1871/72, the surrounding rural areas from these three prefectures and the Setagaya exclave of Hikone ex-domain/prefecture were merged into Tokyo.

The &quot;system of large and small/major and minor districts&quot; (大区小区制, &quot;daiku-shōku-sei&quot;) which was tied to the modernized family registration system &quot;(koseki)&quot; created an (unpopular) subdivision of all prefectures into numbered subunits.

In 1878, the ancient ritsuryō districts were reactivated as administrative units in rural areas, and the status of urban districts &quot;(-ku)&quot; was newly introduced for major cities. Under the &quot;gunkuchōson-hensei-hō&quot; (郡区町村編制法, &quot;Law on the organization of -gun/-ku/-chō/-son&quot;), both urban and rural districts were further subdivided into urban and rural units (&quot;-machi&quot; and &quot;-mura&quot;, i.e. towns and villages in the countryside, but neighbourhood-sized units in larger settlements; for example, there were 13 -machi/-chō and 93 -mura in Ebara District in the 1870s, including five (one &quot;North&quot;, three &quot;South&quot;, one &quot;New&quot;) for Shinagawa alone; the &gt;100 subdivisions of Ebara were merged into only 1 town and 18 villages in 1889, today there are only four special wards left in its former territory: Shinagawa, Meguro, Ōta, Setagaya). Initially, Tokyo contained only six [rural] districts, but other rural areas were added to Tokyo later (Izu &amp; Ogasawara islands 1878/80, the three Tama districts 1893).

When the modern municipalities were introduced in 1889, Tokyo was subdivided into c. 80 municipalities: 1 city, a handful of towns, and dozens of villages. With the Tama transfer of 1893, the number of municipalities in Tokyo grew to over 170. By 1943, there were only 87 municipalities left: 3 cities, 18 towns and 66 villages (see the List of mergers in Tokyo).

Even after the Tama transfer, Tokyo City remained the dominant part of Tokyo in terms of population and economic strength. That increased further during the progressing industrialization and the explosive growth of the city in the early 20th century, only temporarily set back by the devastation brought about by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. The outskirts grew, but eventually Tokyo City&#x27;s dominance within Tokyo only increased again as many of the explosively grown suburbs were merged into Tokyo City in 1932, including some of the largest towns in Japanese history with over 100,000 inhabitants each such as in and in .

Various plans for a unification of the prefectural and city government were discussed over the decades. An early proposal in the 1890s by then Home Minister Nomura Yasushi envisioned to separate the rural areas of Tokyo as Musashi prefecture and transform only Tokyo City into a &quot;Metropolis&quot;, but it failed in the Imperial Diet. Some plans, especially those by the commoner political parties and during the &quot;Taishō democracy&quot; of the 1920s, envisioned a &quot;Metropolis&quot; more similar to a special city: an enlarged, prefecture-level city with &quot;more&quot; local autonomy. While the city did gain some additional authority under the 1922 &quot;six major cities law&quot; (more formally: 六大都市行政監督ニ関スル法律, &quot;roku-daitoshi gyōsei kantoku ni kan suru hōritsu&quot;, &quot;Law relating to the administrative supervision of the six major cities&quot;), and the governments made plans for a &quot;Metropolis&quot; system – the 1932 &quot;Greater Tokyo City&quot; mergers had been part of a Metropolis plan from the Tokyo City Assembly –, the actual reform was carried out later as part of the Tōjō cabinet&#x27;s wartime authoritarian centralization measures (or &quot;simplification of local government&quot;). Not only was the Home Ministry control over prefectures and municipalities tightened as in the whole country – municipal mayors became appointive similar to the Meiji era –; Tokyo&#x27;s prefectural government and Tokyo City&#x27;s municipal government were indeed unified into one &quot;Metropolitan&quot; government, but under still tighter central government supervision.

Thus, in 1943, 86 of Tokyo&#x27;s 87 municipalities remained Tokyo&#x27;s municipalities, Tokyo City was abolished, all municipalities and the 35 ex-city wards were now part of which continues to serve as prefectural government for all of Tokyo, but now additionally as the municipal government in former Tokyo City. The governor of Tokyo, previously &quot;chiji&quot; as in all prefectures, was now called &quot;chōkan&quot; (&quot;head/chief&quot; [often of a central government agency]) and tied even more closely to the Imperial government than the governors of other prefectures. He became a &quot;shinninkan&quot; (親任官), meaning he was appointed directly by the Emperor, in the same procedure as a member of the Cabinet, the governors of Chōsen/Korea or Taiwan/Formosa, or an Army General or Navy Admiral.

The &quot;Metropolis&quot; is not to be confused with the Tokyo metropolitan area which extends into prefectures other than Tokyo and, depending on definition, may or may not include all of the &quot;Metropolis&quot;.

In 1944/45, the establishment of regional bureaus created new parallel local administrative structures, lacking even the limited control by elected assemblies that prefectures and municipalities featured. And on the local level, the pre-existing neighbourhood associations (see &quot;chōnaikai&quot; and &quot;Tonarigumi&quot;) had been tied into the totalitarian Yokusankai vision and were endowed with far-reaching authority to establish an authoritarian system of control reaching down even to individual citizens. But the war tide had turned, and soon, the occupation under Douglas MacArthur overturned the wartime centralization, and beyond that, introduced new far-reaching local autonomy rights for prefectures, municipalities and even citizens in the form of &quot;direct demands&quot; (&quot;chokusetsu seikyū&quot;: recalls, popular initiative referendums for prefectural/municipal by-laws [excluding taxation], petitions, etc.).

The title &quot;chōkan&quot; for the governor actually remained in place until 1947 when the Constitution and the Local Autonomy Law made Tokyo equal with other prefectures again and gave the residents of former Tokyo City (almost) the same rights as in other municipalities with the introduction of special wards. The , held in April 1947 as part of the , was still held as &quot;Tōkyō-to chōkan senkyo&quot;, and the first elected governor (who had also been the penultimate appointed governor from 1946 to 1947) initially still took office as &quot;chōkan&quot;, but became &quot;chiji&quot; in May 1947.

<doc id="482192" wikidata="Q913138" url="?curid=482192" title="Yngling">
<text>The Ynglings were a dynasty of kings, first in Sweden and later in Norway, primarily attested through the poem &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;. The dynasty also appears as Scylfings (, ) in &quot;Beowulf&quot;. When &quot;Beowulf&quot; and &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; were composed sometime in the eighth to tenth centuries, their respective authors (scops and skalds) expected their audience to have a great deal of background information about these kings, which is shown in the allusiveness of the references.

According to sources such as &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; and &quot;Íslendingabók&quot;, the Fairhair dynasty in Oppland, Norway was in fact a branch of the Ynglings (here Yngling is explicitly used as the name of the dynasty). Saxo Grammaticus held that the Ynglings also included Eric the Victorious, who is usually the first king in modern regnal lists, and his descendants. However, this does not tally with Icelandic sources.

The dynasty claimed descent from the gods Freyr and Njörðr, and other kings were likely mythical as well, whereas others may have been real: especially Egil, Ottar, Ale and Adils that are mentioned in Beowulf as well as Nordic sources. 
== Names ==
In the Scandinavian sources they are the descendants of Yngvi-Frey of Vanaheim. &quot;Yngling&quot; means &quot;descendant of Frey&quot;, and in the &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; of Saxo Grammaticus they are called the &quot;sons of Frey&quot;. Several of these kings appear in &quot;Beowulf&quot;: Eadgils (Adils), Onela (Ale), and Ohthere (Ottar Vendelkråka), but here they are called &quot;Scylfings&quot; (see the Beowulf section below).

In his &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; the 13th-century Icelandic writer Snorri Sturluson hints at a less divine origin for this dynasty: &quot;One war-king was named Skelfir; and his house is called the House of Skilfings: his kindred is in the Eastern Land.&quot; In &quot;Ynglinga Saga&quot;, Snorri discusses marriages between Swedish and Finnish royal families. In the section of Edda, he discusses King Halfdan the Old, Nór&#x27;s great-grandson, and nine of his sons who are the forefathers of various royal lineages, including &quot;Yngvi, from whom the Ynglings are descended&quot;.

According to the , &quot;Nór&quot; founded Norway. He was a direct descendant of Fornjótr, the King of &quot;Gotland, Kvenland and Finnland&quot;. In traditional Scandinavian lineages we find Halfdan the Old as the Great-grandfather of Ragnvald Eysteinson Jarl of Møre, the father of Rollo, called Gengu-Hrolf in Norse sources, the Viking conqueror who founded Normandy, who Dudo of Saint-Quentin testifies took the name Robert after converting to Christianity. He is also known as Count Rou of Rouen, and is said to have been William the Conqueror&#x27;s great-great-great-grandfather.

 (&#x27;How Norway was founded&#x27;) is a 14th-century account of the origin of various legendary Norwegian lineages. It too traces the descendants of the primeval Finnish ruler Fornjotr back through Nór and his siblings, Góí and Gór; Nór being here the eponym and first great king of Norway, and then gives details of the descendants of Nór and of his brother Gór in the following section known as the (&#x27;Genealogies&#x27;, a.k.a. , &#x27;Founding of Norway&#x27;). The Hversu account is closely paralleled by the opening of the .

The &#x27;genealogies&#x27; also claim that many heroic families famed in Scandinavian tradition but not located in Norway were of a Finn-Kven stock, mostly sprung from Nór&#x27;s great-grandson Halfdan the Old. Almost all the lineages sprung from Halfdan are then shown to reconvert in the person of Harald Fairhair, the first king of &quot;all Norway&quot;. This information can be confirmed in other sources.

The &#x27;Ættartölur&#x27; account ends to a genealogy of Harald&#x27;s royal descendants down to Olaf IV of Norway with the statement that the account was written in 1387, and with a list of the kings of Norway from this Olaf back to Harald Fair-hair.

Another origin for the name &quot;skilfing&quot; is possible: Snorri described Erik and Alrik, the sons of &quot;Skjalf&quot; to be the de facto ancestors of this Norse clan.

:&quot;The kings who resided at Upsal had been the supreme chiefs over the whole Swedish dominions until the death of Agne, when, as before related, the kingdom came to be divided between brothers (Alrek and Erik). After that time the dominions and kingly powers were spread among the branches of the family as these increased; but some kings cleared great tracts of forest-land, and settled them, and thereby increased their domains.&quot;

== From Sweden to Norway ==
According to Snorri Sturluson, the dynasty led the settlement of the Swedish provinces and established themselves as the kings of its provinces, accepting the overlordship of the Swedish king at Uppsala, until the dynasty all but exterminated itself with Ingjald Ill-Ruler and his downfall. A survivor Olof Trätälja was the ancestor of the Norwegian branch.

== Remaining in Sweden ==

However, both Snorri (as in the earlier quote) and Saxo described the clan as remaining in Sweden after this date.

Saxo on the Battle of Bråvalla (ca 750):
:&quot;Now the bravest of the Swedes were these: Arwakki, Keklu-Karl (Kelke-Karl), Krok the Peasant, (from Akr), Gudfast and Gummi from Gislamark. These were kindred of the god Frey, and most faithful witnesses to the gods. Ingi (Yngwe) also, and Oly, Alver, Folki, all sons of Elrik (Alrek), embraced the service of Sigurd Hring; they were men ready of hand, quick in counsel, and very close friends of Ring. They likewise held the god Frey to be the founder of their race. Amongst these from the town of Sigtun (Old Sigtuna) also came Sigmund, a champion advocate, versed in making contracts of sale and purchase; besides him Frosti surnamed Bowl: allied with him was Alf the Lofty (Erect?spear-thrower?) from the district of Upsala (Old Uppsala); this man was a swift spear-thrower, and used to go in the front of the battle.&quot;

Moreover, both in Icelandic sources and in the &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, King Sigurd Hring would become the ancestor of the houses of Ragnar Lodbrok and would thus be the semi-legendary ancestor of the House of Munsö through Björn Ironside, and the Danish royal house through Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye. Ragnar&#x27;s eldest son Ivar the Boneless was the leader of the Great Heathen Army and appears to have been the founder of the Uí Ímair dynasty of the Kingdom of York and Kingdom of Dublin, and by extension the Crovan Dynasty of the Kings of Mann.

== The line ==
==The family tree==
This is the mythic Yngling family tree based on &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot;, &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, &quot;Beowulf&quot; and other Old Norse sources. The names of Swedish kings are shown in bold.

==The name Scylfing==
In Old English several kings who are generally identified as Ynglings are called Scylfings.
The genealogy is given as:


Ohthere (&quot;Ottar&quot;) also occurs as the father of Aedgils (&quot;Adils&quot;) in Ynglingatal. There Skilfing (&quot;Skilfingr&quot;) appears as a synonym of Yngling, in a line on &quot;Egil&quot;, the father of &quot;Ottar&quot;, so that Ongentheow is considered identical to &quot;Egil&quot;.

Likewise in the &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; the Scylfings are described as an eastern family and &quot;East King&quot; was a conventional kenning for a Swedish king.

However, in the , (the genealogies attached to ), the Skilfings are of Norwegian origin and include a family identified as &quot;Skjöldungs&quot;. In the eddic poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot; (stanza 55), &quot;Skilfing&quot; appears as one of Odin&#x27;s names, the information there also appearing in the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;..

=== &quot;Beowulf&quot; ===
In the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, the word &quot;Scylfing&quot; occurs twice in the singular and twice in the plural. For alliterative purposes the name could be extended, such as the form &quot;Heathoscylfing&quot; &#x27;Battle-Scylfing&#x27;, which occurs once in the singular and twice in the plural. A Scylfing whose name is partly missing but ends in &quot;-ela&quot; married the sister of Hrothgar and Halga. Specifically identified as Scylfings are Ongentheow, king of Sweden, and by extension his subject Wiglaf son of Weohstan. Wiglaf and Weohstan belonged to the family of the Wægmundings to which Beowulf and his father Ecgtheow also belonged. Another extended form is &quot;helm Scylfinga&quot;. This literally means &#x27;Scylfings&#x27;-helmet&#x27;; it is a kenning meaning both &quot;ruler of the Scylfings&quot; and &quot;protector of the Scylfings&quot;. The &quot;Beowulf&quot; poet uses it to refer to Ongentheow&#x27;s son Onela.

=== In Norse tradition ===

==== From the ====
The eddic poem , in stanza 16 speaks of descendants of an ancient king named Halfdan the Old:Hence come the Skjöldungs, hence the Skilfings,
Hence the Ödlings [], hence the Ylfings, ...

==== From the ====
In the , Snorri Sturluson speaks of the second group of nine sons of Halfdan the Old, from whom many families of legend descend, one of these sons being Yngvi, purported ancestor of the Yngling lineage. But neither Skylfings or Skjöldungs are specifically derived from these sons. Snorri continues with examples of famous descendants of three of those lineages, followed by: &quot;Of the house of the Ylfings was Eirík the Eloquent ().&quot; But Ylfings have not been previously mentioned. Then follows the names of four ancestors of four lineages not descended from Halfdan, which include Yngvi and the Ynglings a second time. There is obvious confusion or corruption in this passage or its source. The fourth lineage is identified:
One war-king was named Skelfir; and his house is called the House of Skilfings: his kindred is in the Eastern Region.
A connection with the east might mean a connection to Sweden, but the vagueness of expression suggests Snorri knows no more about these Skilfings than he has written.

Snorri also gives &quot;Skilfing&quot; as a kenning for &quot;king&quot; and it appears as a kenning for &quot;sword&quot; in the found in some versions of the .

==== From the ====
The connected to are a longer variant of the genealogical passages in the , also speaking of Halfdan the Old and lineages descended from him and of other notable lineages, but in much greater detail. In this list of the sons of Halfdan, Yngvi the ancestor of the Ynglings is missing and Skelfir the ancestor of the Skilfings appears in his place. This might be a remembrance of an earlier identity or connection of the Swedish Ynglings and the Swedish Scylfings in &quot;Beowulf&quot;. But nothing in the following genealogy is &quot;necessarily&quot; Swedish though possible Swedish parallels do appear, particular the names Alrek and Eirík as discussed below.

There are many oddities in this account.

It claims Skelfir was king of Vörs (&quot;Vǫrs&quot;), modern Voss in northern Hordaland in southwestern Norway, but Halfdan&#x27;s inheritance was in southeastern Norway.

Skelfir was the father of Skjöld (&quot;Skjǫldr&quot;). The account ends by saying that lineage of Skelfir was called the Skilfing lineage or the Skjöldung lineage, seemingly identifying the two. But Skjöldungs are normally the legendary royal family of the rulers of Denmark and no connection with Denmark is made here. Indeed, the &quot;Ættartǫlur&quot; later twice gives a quite different list of descendants of the Danish Skjöld who is there made a son of Odin as commonly in Norse texts. Skjöld as son of Skelfir might be related to English traditions of Scyld being a son or descendant of Sceafa (as discussed under Sceafa), though here too (at least in &quot;Beowulf&quot;) the connection is to Danish matters, not to Norway.

This Norwegian Skjöld, ancestor of the Norwegian Skjöldungs, is father of Eirík, father of Alrek (&quot;Alrekr&quot;), father of Eirík the Eloquent, whom the &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; presented as an Ylfing. These two mentions are the only occurrences of Eirík the Eloquent in Norse texts. But what seems to be the same figure appears prominently in book 5 of Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; as Ericus disertus. This Ericus disertus is indeed a Norwegian, but his father is not named Alrek but rather Regnerus pugilex, that is Ragnar the Champion. The &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; then somewhat forcibly identifies Ericus disertus with Eirík, a legendary king of Sweden, a king who in the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; and elsewhere has an elder brother (rather than a father) named Alrek. See Alrek and Eirík for details.

In the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; the mother of the Swedish kings Alrek and Eirík is named Skjálf, which might also be an eponym for Skilfing.

Returning to the , there Eirík the Eloquent is father of Alrek, father of Víkar (&quot;Víkarr&quot;), father of Vatnar. This Víkar is the famous Víkar, king of Hördaland, who was sacrificed to Odin by Starkad. The chain of descent from Alrek to Víkar to Vatnar is also found in &quot;Hálfs saga ok Hálfsrekka&quot; (&#x27;The saga of Hálf and his heroes&#x27;). However &quot;Gautreks saga&quot; gives an entirely different ancestry and different descendants to Víkar. See Víkar for details.

This genealogy may have been based on attempts to ascribe a Norwegian origin to both Swedish Scylfings and Danish Skjöldungs and also be related to Saxo&#x27;s account of the Norwegian Ericus desertus. If so, as it stands, it has been edited to remove material that would obviously conflict with the standard genealogies of the Skjöldungs and Ynglings which also appear in the .

<doc id="482194" wikidata="Q720711" url="?curid=482194" title="Light machine gun">
<text>A light machine gun (LMG) is a light-weight machine gun designed to be operated by a single infantryman, with or without an assistant, as an infantry support weapon. LMGs firing cartridges of the same caliber as the other riflemen of the same combat unit are often referred to as squad automatic weapons.

==Characteristics ==
While early light machine guns fired full-powered rifle cartridges, modern light machine guns often fire smaller-caliber rifle cartridges than medium machine guns – generally the same intermediate cartridge fired by a service&#x27;s standard assault rifle – and are usually lighter and more compact. Some LMGs, such as the Russian RPK, are modifications of existing designs and designed to share the same ammunition. Adaptations to the original rifle generally include a larger magazine, a heavier barrel to resist overheating, a more robust mechanism to support sustained fire and a bipod.

A light machine gun is also defined by its usage as well as its specifications: some machine guns – notably general-purpose machine guns – may be deployed either as a light machine gun or a medium machine gun. Deployed on a tripod and used for sustained fire, it is a medium machine gun; if deployed with a bipod with the operator in a prone position and firing short bursts, it is a light machine gun.

Light machine guns are also designed to be fired from the hip or on the move as a form of suppressive fire intended to pin down the enemy. Marching fire is a specific tactic that relies on this capability.

Lighter modern LMGs have enabled them to be issued down at the fireteam level, with two or three at the section/squad level.

===Ammunition feed===
Many light machine guns (such as the Bren gun or the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle) were magazine-fed. Others, such as the Hotchkiss M1922, could be fed either from a belt/strip or from a box magazine. Modern light machine guns are designed to fire smaller caliber rounds and, as such, tend to be belt-fed (from a container attached to the gun) or from a detachable high-capacity drum magazine, but some, such as the FN Minimi, will also accept standard rifle magazine feeding as an auxiliary measure when belted ammunition has been exhausted.

==History==
In 1903, French military theorists noticed that the heavy machine guns of the day were of little use in infantry assaults. They determined that &quot;the machine gun must learn to walk&quot;. They researched the possibility of a light machine gun which could be carried by troops. A marching fire tactic was theorised, using incidental suppressive fire, with the advancing troops considered a deadlier threat than the un-aimed bullets, causing the enemy to fall back. The prototype guns were not approved for production, and none were in service when World War I began. The French quickly brought the prototypes to mass production to boost the firepower of advancing infantry.

By the end of World War II, light machine guns were usually being issued on a scale of one per fire team or squad, and the modern infantry squad had emerged with tactics that were built around the use of the LMG to provide suppressive fire.

==Selected examples==


The following were either exclusively light machine guns, had a light machine gun variant or were employed in the light machine gun role with certain adaptations.

<text>Baron Bellew, of Barmeath in the County of Louth, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created on 17 July 1848 for Sir Patrick Bellew, 7th Baronet, who had previously represented Louth in the House of Commons as a Whig and also served as Lord Lieutenant of County Louth. His grandson, the third Baron, was also Lord Lieutenant of County Louth and sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1904 to 1911. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Baron. He was an Irish Representative Peer from 1914 to 1931. In 1881 Lord Bellew assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Bryan under the terms of the will of his maternal uncle Colonel George Bryan. However, he is the only one of the Barons to have held this surname. On his death the titles passed to his nephew, the fifth Baron, and then to his younger brother, the sixth Baron. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the eighth Baron, who succeeded in 2010.

The Bellew baronetcy, of Barmeath in the County of Louth, was created in the Baronetage of Ireland on 11 December 1688 for the first Baron Bellew&#x27;s great-great-grandfather Patrick Bellew, a Jacobite supporter of James II. His brother Christopher Bellew was the ancestor of the Grattan-Bellew baronets, of Mount Bellew, a title created in 1838.

The family seat is Barmeath Castle, near Dunleer, County Louth. Another branch of the family was created Baron Bellew of Duleek in 1686 for their loyalty to James II.

<text>Baron Oranmore and Browne, of Carrabrowne Castle in the County of Galway and of Castle Macgarrett in the County of Mayo, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1836 for Dominick Browne, who had earlier represented County Mayo in the House of Commons. His son, the second Baron, sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1869 to 1900. Lord Oranmore and Browne assumed the surname of Guthrie on his marriage in 1859 to Christina Guthrie. He was succeeded by his son, the third Baron. He was an Irish Representative Peer from 1902 to 1926 and a member of the short-lived Senate of Southern Ireland. In 1926 he was created Baron Mereworth, of Mereworth Castle in the County of Kent, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This title gave the barons an automatic seat in the House of Lords until the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. On his death in 1927 the title passed to his son, the fourth Baron. He married, as his third wife, the actress Sally Gray. Lord Oranmore and Browne died in August 2002, aged 100 years and 291 days. He was thereby the third-oldest hereditary peer ever. the titles are held by his son, the fifth Baron, who succeeded in 2002.

In May 2011, Mereworth went to court to attempt to force the House of Lords to issue him a Writ of Summons allowing him to sit and vote in the House by virtue of the Letters Patent issued in the creation of the barony. The case – &quot;Baron Mereworth v Ministry of Justice&quot; – was dismissed on the grounds that the High Court did not have jurisdiction on how the House of Lords conducted its business. Furthermore, even if the court did have jurisdiction, the House of Lords Act 1999 clearly withdrew the right of holders of Letters Patent to be issued a Writ of Summons purely &quot;by virtue&quot; of those Letters. Mereworth was also ordered to pay £8,800 in costs. This case was referenced as precedent in the official rebuttal of a claim by Viscount Monckton that he was entitled to claim membership of the House of Lords.

<doc id="482208" wikidata="Q383672" url="?curid=482208" title="555 timer IC">
<text>The 555 timer IC is an integrated circuit used in a variety of timer, delay, pulse generation, and oscillator applications. It is one of the most popular timing ICs due to its flexibility and price. Derivatives provide two (556) or four (558) timing circuits in one package. The design was first marketed in 1972 by Signetics and used bipolar junction transistors. Since then, numerous companies have made the original timers and later similar low-power CMOS timers. In 2017, it was said that over a billion 555 timers are produced annually by some estimates, and that the design was &quot;probably the most popular integrated circuit ever made&quot;.

== History ==
The timer IC was designed in 1971 by Hans Camenzind under contract to Signetics. In 1968, he was hired by Signetics to develop a phase-locked loop (PLL) IC. He designed an oscillator for PLLs such that the frequency did not depend on the power supply voltage or temperature. Signetics subsequently laid off half of its employees due to the 1970 recession, and development on the PLL was thus frozen. Camenzind proposed the development of a universal circuit based on the oscillator for PLLs and asked that he develop it alone, borrowing equipment from Signetics instead of having his pay cut in half. Camenzind&#x27;s idea was originally rejected, since other engineers argued the product could be built from existing parts sold by the company; however, the marketing manager approved the idea.

The first design for the 555 was reviewed in the summer of 1971. After this design was tested and found to be without errors, Camenzind got the idea of using a direct resistance instead of a constant current source, finding that it worked satisfactorily. The design change decreased the required 9 external pins to 8, so the IC could be fit in an 8-pin package instead of a 14-pin package. This revised version passed a second design review, and the prototypes were completed in October 1971 as the NE555V (plastic DIP) and SE555T (metal TO-5). The 9-pin version had already been released by another company founded by an engineer who had attended the first review and had retired from Signetics; that firm withdrew its version soon after the 555 was released. The 555 timer was manufactured by 12 companies in 1972, and it became a best-selling product.

The 555 found many applications beyond timers. Camenzind noted in 1997 that &quot;nine out of 10 of its applications were in areas and ways I had never contemplated. For months I was inundated by phone calls from engineers who had new ideas for using the device.&quot;

=== Name ===
Several books report the name &quot;555&quot; timer IC derived from the three 5 kΩ resistors inside the chip. However, in a recorded interview with an online transistor museum curator, Hans Camenzind said &quot;It was just arbitrarily chosen. It was Art Fury (marketing manager) who thought the circuit was gonna sell big who picked the name &#x27;555&#x27; timer IC.&quot;

==Design==
Depending on the manufacturer, the standard 555 package incorporated the equivalent of 25 transistors, 2 diodes, and 15 resistors on a silicon chip packaged into an 8-pin dual in-line package (DIP-8). Variants available included the 556 (a DIP-14 combining two complete 555s on one chip), and 558 / 559 (both variants were a DIP-16 combining four reduced-functionality timers on one chip).

The NE555 parts were commercial temperature range, 0 °C to +70 °C, and the SE555 part number designated the military temperature range, −55 °C to +125 °C. These chips were available in both high-reliability metal can (T package) and inexpensive epoxy plastic (V package) form factors. Thus, the full part numbers were NE555V, NE555T, SE555V, and SE555T.

Low-power CMOS versions of the 555 are now available, such as the Intersil ICM7555 and Texas Instruments LMC555, TLC555, TLC551.

=== Internal schematic ===
The internal block diagram and schematic of the 555 timer are highlighted with the same color across all three drawings to clarify how the chip is implemented:
* : Between the positive supply voltage VCC and the ground GND is a voltage divider consisting of three identical resistors (5kΩ for bipolar timers, 100kΩ or higher for CMOS) to create reference voltages for the analog comparators. CONTROL is connected between the upper two resistors, allowing an external voltage to control the reference voltages:
** When CONTROL is not driven, this divider creates an upper reference voltage of VCC and a lower reference voltage of VCC.
** When CONTROL is driven, the upper reference voltage will instead be VCONTROL and the lower reference voltage will be VCONTROL.
* : The comparator&#x27;s negative input is connected to voltage divider&#x27;s upper reference voltage, and the comparator&#x27;s positive input is connected to THRESHOLD.
* : The comparator&#x27;s positive input is connected to voltage divider&#x27;s lower reference, and the comparator&#x27;s negative input is connected to TRIGGER.
* : A set-reset latch stores the state of the timer and is controlled by the two comparators. RESET overrides the other two inputs, thus the latch (and therefore the entire timer) can be reset at any time.
* : The output of the latch is followed by an output stage with pushpull output drivers that can supply up to 200mA for bipolar timers, lower for CMOS timers.
* : Also, the output of the latch controls a transistor acting as an electronic switch that connects DISCHARGE to ground.

===Pinout===
The pinout of the 8-pin 555 timer and 14-pin 556 dual timer are shown in the following table. Since the 556 is conceptually two 555 timers that share power pins, the pin numbers for each half are split across two columns.

== Modes ==
The 555 IC has the following operating modes:
# Astable (free-running) mode – The 555 operates as an electronic oscillator. Applications include:
#* Light emitting diode and lamp flashers, pulse generation, pulse-width modulation (PWM), logic clocks, tone generation, security alarms, pulse-position modulation, etc.
#* Analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) from an analog value represented by a resistance or capacitance into a digital pulse length.
#** e.g., selecting a thermistor as timing resistor allows the use of the 555 in a temperature sensor with the period of the output pulse determined by the temperature. A microprocessor can then convert the pulse period to temperature, linearize it, and even provide calibration.
# Monostable (one-shot) mode – The 555 operates as a &quot;one-shot&quot; pulse generator. Applications include:
#* timers, missing pulse detection, bounce-free switches, touch switches, frequency dividers, triggered measurement of resistance or capacitance, PWM, etc.
# Bistable (latch) mode – The 555 operates as a set-reset latch. Applications include:
#* switch debouncing.
# Schmitt trigger (inverter) mode – the 555 operates as a Schmitt trigger inverter gate. Application:
#* Converts a noisy input into a clean digital output.

=== Astable ===

In the astable configuration, the 555 timer puts out a continuous stream of rectangular pulses having a specific period.

The astable configuration is implemented using two resistors, formula_1 and formula_2 and one capacitor formula_3. The threshold and trigger pins are both connected to the capacitor; thus they have the same voltage.

Its repeated operating cycle (starting with the capacitor uncharged) is:

# Since the capacitor&#x27;s voltage will be below  &quot;V&quot;CC, the trigger pin causes the 555&#x27;s internal latch to change state, causing OUT to go high and the internal discharge transistor to cut-off.
# Since the discharge pin is no longer short-circuited to ground, the capacitor starts charging via current from Vcc through the resistors formula_1 and formula_5.
# Once the capacitor charge reaches  Vcc, the threshold pin causes the 555&#x27;s internal latch to change state, causing OUT to go low and the internal discharge transistor to go into saturation (maximal-conductivity) mode.
# This discharge transistor provides a discharge path, so the capacitor starts discharging through formula_5.
# Once the capacitor&#x27;s voltage drops below  &quot;V&quot;CC, the cycle repeats from step 1.

During the first pulse, the capacitor charges from 0 V to  &quot;V&quot;CC, however, in later pulses, it only charges from  &quot;V&quot;CC to  &quot;V&quot;CC. Consequently, the first pulse has a longer high time interval compared to later pulses. Moreover, the capacitor charges through both resistors but only discharges through formula_5, thus the output high interval is longer than the low interval. This is shown in the following equations:

The output high time interval of each pulse is given by:

: formula_8

The output low time interval of each pulse is given by:

: formula_9

Hence, the frequency formula_10 of the pulse is given by:

: formula_11

and the duty cycle formula_12 is given by:

: formula_13

where formula_14 is the time in seconds, formula_15 is the resistance in ohms, formula_3 is the capacitance in farads, and formula_17 is the natural log of 2 constant.
Resistor formula_1 requirements:
* The maximum current through formula_1 must be lower than the maximum current rating of the internal transisor at the DISCHARGE pin, because this transistor &quot;shorts&quot; the DISCHARGE pin to the GND pin (per internal schematics above) to drain the capacitor. This is the reason why formula_1 shouldn&#x27;t be a very low resistance, such as when a variable trimmer or potentiometer is used instead of a fixed value resistor.
* The maximum power rating of formula_1 must be greater than formula_22, per Ohm&#x27;s law.

==== Shorter duty cycle ====
To create an output high time shorter than the low time (i.e., a duty cycle less than 50%) a fast diode (i.e. 1N4148 signal diode) can be placed in parallel with R2, with the cathode on the capacitor side. This bypasses R2 during the high part of the cycle, so that the high interval depends only on R1 and C, with an adjustment based on the voltage drop across the diode. The low time is unaffected by the diode and so remains formula_23 But the diode&#x27;s forward voltage drop &quot;V&quot;diode slows charging on the capacitor, so the high time is longer than the often-cited formula_24 to become:

: formula_25

where &quot;V&quot;diode is when the diode&#x27;s &quot;on&quot; current is of &quot;V&quot;CC/R1 (which depends on the type of diode and can be found in datasheets or measured). When Vdiode is small relative to &quot;V&quot;cc, this charging is faster and approaches formula_24 but is slower the closer Vdiode is to &quot;V&quot;cc:

As an extreme example, when &quot;V&quot;CC = 5 V, and Vdiode = 0.7 V, high time is 1.00 R1C, which is 45% longer than the &quot;expected&quot; 0.693 R1C. At the other extreme, when &quot;V&quot;cc = 15 V, and Vdiode = 0.3 V, the high time is 0.725 R1C, which is closer to the expected 0.693 R1C. The equation approaches 0.693 R1C as &quot;V&quot;diode approaches 0 V.

==== Voltage-controlled pulse-width modulation ====
In the previous example schematics, the control pin was not used, thus it should connected to ground through a 10 nF decoupling capacitor to shunt electrical noise. However if a time-varying voltage source was applied to the control pin, then the pulse widths would be dependent on the control voltage.

=== Monostable ===


Monostable mode produces an output pulse when the trigger signals drops below &quot;V&quot;CC. An RC circuit sets the output pulse&#x27;s duration as the time formula_14 in seconds it takes to charge C to &quot;V&quot;CC:

: formula_28

where formula_15 is the resistance in ohms, formula_3 is the capacitance in farads, formula_31 is the natural log of 3 constant. The output pulse duration can be lengthened or shortened as desired by adjusting the values of R and C. Subsequent triggering before the end of this timing interval won&#x27;t affect the output pulse. 

==== Example values ====
The timing table (right) shows common electronic component value solutions for various powers of 10 timings.

Scaling R and C by opposite powers of 10 will provide the same timing. For instance:
* 1ms ≅ 1nF and 910kΩ,
* 1ms ≅ 10nF and 91kΩ (values from table),
* 1ms ≅ 100nF and 9.1kΩ.

For each row in the example table (right), additional timing values can easily be created by adding one to three of the same resistor value in parallel and/or series. A second resistor in parallel, the new timing is half the table time. A second resistor in series, the new timing is double the table time.
* 2.5ms (0.25x) ≅ 100nF and 22.75kΩ (four 91kΩ resistors in parallel),
* 5ms (0.5x) ≅ 100nF and 45.5kΩ (two 91kΩ resistors in parallel),
* 10ms (1x) ≅ 100nF and 91kΩ (values from table),
* 15ms (1.5x) ≅ 100nF and 136.5kΩ (one 91kΩ resistor in series with &quot;two 91kΩ resistors in parallel&quot;),
* 20ms (2x) ≅ 100nF and 182kΩ (two 91kΩ resistors in series),
* 25ms (2.5x) ≅ 100nF and 227.5kΩ (&quot;two 91kΩ resistors in series&quot; in series with &quot;two 91kΩ resistors in parallel&quot;),
* 30ms (3x) ≅ 100nF and 273kΩ (three 91kΩ resistors in series),
* 40ms (4x) ≅ 100nF and 364kΩ (four 91kΩ resistors in series).
=== Bistable SR latch ===


A 555 timer can act as an active-low SR latch (though without an inverted output) with two outputs: output pin is a push-pull output, discharge pin is an open-collector output (requires a pull-up resistor).

For the schematic on the right, a input signal connects to the pin and connecting a input signal to the pin. Thus, pulling momentarily low acts as a &quot;set&quot; and transitions the output to the high state (&quot;V&quot;CC). Conversely, pulling momentarily low acts as a &quot;reset&quot; and transitions the Out pin to the low state (GND).

No timing capacitors are required in a bistable configuration. The threshold input is grounded because it is unused. The trigger and reset inputs may be held high via pull-up resistors if they are normally Hi-Z and only enabled by connecting to ground.
=== Bistable Schmitt trigger inverter gate ===


A 555 timer can be used to create a Schmitt trigger inverter gate with two outputs: output pin is a push-pull output, discharge pin is an open-collector output (requires a pull-up resistor).

For the schematic on the right, an input signal is AC-coupled through a low value series capacitor, then biased by identical high-resistance resistors formula_1 and formula_5, which causes the signal to be centered at &quot;V&quot;cc. This centered signal is connected to both the trigger and threshold input pins of the timer. The input signal must be strong enough to excite the trigger levels of the comparators to exceed the lower &quot;V&quot;CC and upper &quot;V&quot;CC thresholds in order to cause them to change state, thus providing the Schmitt trigger feature.

No timing capacitors are required in a bistable configuration.
==Packages==
In 1972, Signetics originally released the 555 timer in DIP-8 and TO5-8 metal can packages, and the 556 timer was released in a DIP-14 package.

In 2006, the dual 556 timer was available in through-hole packages as DIP-14 (2.54 mm pitch), and surface-mount packages as SO-14 (1.27 mm pitch) and SSOP-14 (0.65 mm pitch).

In 2012, the 555 was available in through-hole packages as DIP-8 (2.54 mm pitch), and surface-mount packages as SO-8 (1.27 mm pitch), SSOP-8 / TSSOP-8 / VSSOP-8 (0.65 mm pitch), BGA (0.5 mm pitch).

The MIC1555 is a CMOS 555-type timer with three fewer pins available in SOT23-5 (0.95 mm pitch) surface-mount package.

== Specifications ==

These specifications apply to the original bipolar NE555. Other 555 timers can have different specifications depending on the grade (industrial, military, medical, etc.).

==Derivatives==
Numerous companies have manufactured one or more variants of the 555, 556, 558 timers over the past decades, under many different part numbers. The following is a partial list:

; Table notes
* All information in the above table was pulled from references in the datasheet column, except where denoted below.
* For the &quot;Total timers&quot; column, a &quot;*&quot; denotes parts that are missing 555 timer features.
* For the &quot;&quot;I&quot;q&quot; column, a 5-volt supply was chosen as a common voltage to make it easier to compare. The value for Signetics NE558 is an estimate because NE558 datasheets don&#x27;t state &quot;I&quot;q at 5 V. The value listed in this table was estimated by comparing the 5 V to 15 V ratio of other bipolar datasheets, then derating the 15 V parameter for the NE558 part, which is denoted by the &quot;*&quot;.
* For the &quot;Frequency max.&quot; column, a &quot;*&quot; denotes values that may not be the actual maximum frequency limit of the part. The MIC1555 datasheet discusses limitations from 1 to 5 MHz. Though most bipolar timers don&#x27;t state the maximum frequency in their datasheets, they all have a maximum frequency limitation of hundreds of kHz across their full temperature range. Section 8.1 of the Texas Instruments NE555 datasheet states a value of 100 kHz, and their website shows a value of 100 kHz in timer comparison tables. Signetics App Note 170 states that most devices will oscillate up to 1 MHz; however, when considering temperature stability, it should be limited to about 500 kHz. The application note from HFO mentions that at higher supply voltages the maximum power dissipation of the circuit might limit the operating frequency, as the supply current increases with frequency.
* For the &quot;Manufacturer&quot; column, the following associates historical 555 timer manufacturers to current company names.
** Fairchild Semiconductor was sold to ON Semiconductor in 2016. ON Semiconductor was founded in 1999 as a spinoff of Motorola Semiconductor Components Group. The MC1455 started as a Motorola product.
** Intersil was sold to Renesas Electronics in 2017. The ICM7555 and ICM7556 started as Intersil products.
** Micrel was sold to Microchip Technology in 2015. The MIC1555 started as a Micrel product.
** National Semiconductor was sold to Texas Instruments in 2011. The LM555 and LM556 started as a National Semiconductor products.
** Signetics was sold to Philips Semiconductor in 1975, later to NXP Semiconductors in 2006.
** Zetex Semiconductors was sold to Diodes Incorporated in 2008. The ZSCT1555 started as a Zetex product.

=== 556 dual timer ===

The dual version is called 556. It features two complete 555 timers in a 14-pin package; only the two power-supply pins are shared between the two timers. In 2020, the bipolar version was available as the NE556, and the CMOS versions were available as the Intersil ICM7556 and Texas Instruments TLC556 and TLC552. See derivatives table in this article.

=== 558 quad timer ===


The quad version is called 558 and has four reduced-functionality timers in a 16-pin package designed primarily for monostable multivibrator applications. By 2014, many versions of 16-pin NE558 have become obsolete.

Partial list of differences between 558 and 555 chips:
* One &quot;V&quot;CC and one GND, similar to 556 chip.
* Four &quot;Reset&quot; are tied together internally to one external pin (558).
* Four &quot;Control Voltage&quot; are tied together internally to one external pin (558).
* Four &quot;Triggers&quot; are falling-edge sensitive (558), instead of level sensitive (555).
* Two resistors in the voltage divider (558), instead of three resistors (555). 
* One comparator (558), instead of two comparators (555).
* Four &quot;Output&quot; are open-collector (O.C.) type (558), instead of push–pull (P.P.) type (555).

<text>Baron Langford, of Summerhill in the County of Meath, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created on 1 July 1800 for Clotworthy Rowley, who had earlier represented Trim and County Meath in the Irish House of Commons. Born Clotworthy Taylor, he was the fourth son of Thomas Taylor, 1st Earl of Bective (whose eldest son was created Marquess of Headfort in 1800) and Jane Rowley, daughter of Hercules Langford Rowley and his wife Elizabeth Rowley, 1st Viscountess Langford (created 1766). The viscountcy of Langford became extinct in 1796 on the death of Hercules Rowley, 2nd Viscount Langford. Clotworthy Taylor succeeded to the Rowley estates and assumed by Royal licence the surname of Rowley in lieu of Taylor. Four years later the Langford title was revived when he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Langford.

Lord Langford&#x27;s great-grandson, the fourth Baron, sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1884 to 1919. He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Baron. On his early death in 1922 the title passed to his uncle, the sixth Baron. He was succeeded by his nephew, the seventh Baron. When he died in 1952 the line of the third Baron failed, and the title was inherited by the late Baron&#x27;s first cousin once removed, the eighth Baron. He was the son of Colonel the Hon. Hercules Langford Boyle Rowley, second son of the second Baron. On his death in 1953 this line of the family also failed. The title passed to his second cousin once removed, the ninth Baron. He was the great-grandson of Hon. Richard Thomas Rowley, second son of the first Baron, who lived to the age of 105. the title is held by the third (but elder legitimate) son of the ninth baron, who succeeded his father in that year.

The family seat is Bodrhyddan Hall, near Rhuddlan, Denbighshire. The original family seat was Summerhill House, near Summerhill, County Meath, in Ireland.

<text>The Museo Egizio () or Egyptian Museum is an archaeological museum in Turin, Italy, specializing in Egyptian archaeology and anthropology. It houses one of the largest collections of Egyptian antiquities, with more than 30,000 artifacts, and is considered the second most important Egyptological collection in the world, after the Egyptian Museum of Cairo. In 2019, it received 853,320 visitors, making it 
one of the most visited museums in Italy.

== History ==

The first object having an association with Egypt to arrive in Turin was the Mensa Isiaca in 1630, an altar table in imitation of Egyptian style, which Dulu Jones suggests had been created for a temple to Isis in Rome. This exotic piece spurred King Charles Emmanuel III to commission botanist Vitaliano Donati to travel to Egypt in 1753 and acquire items from its past. Donati returned with 300 pieces recovered from Karnak and Coptos, which became the nucleus of the Turin collection.

In 1824, King Charles Felix acquired the material from the Drovetti collection (5,268 pieces, including 100 statues, 170 papyri, stelae, mummies, and other items), that the French General Consul, Bernardino Drovetti, had built during his stay in Egypt. In the same year, Jean-François Champollion used the huge Turin collection of papyri to test his breakthroughs in deciphering the hieroglyphic writing. The time Champollion spent in Turin studying the texts is also the origin of a legend about the mysterious disappearance of the &quot;Papiro dei Re&quot;, that was only later found and of which some portions are still unavailable. In 1950, a parapsychologist was contacted to pinpoint them, to no avail.

In 1833, the collection of Piedmontese Giuseppe Sossio (over 1,200 pieces) was added to the Egyptian Museum. The collection was complemented and completed by the finds of Egyptologist Ernesto Schiaparelli, during his excavation campaigns between 1900 and 1920, which further filled out the collection. Its last major acquisition was the small temple of Ellesiya, which the Egyptian government presented to Italy for her assistance during the Nubian monument salvage campaign in the 1960s.

Through all these years, the Egyptian collection has always been in Turin, in the building designed for the purpose of housing it, in Via Accademia delle Scienze 6. Only during the Second World War was some of the material moved to the town of Agliè. The museum became an experiment of the Italian government in privatization of the nation&#x27;s museums when the Fondazione Museo delle Antichità Egizie was officially established at the end of 2004. The building itself was remodelled in celebration of the 2006 Winter Olympics, with its main rooms redesigned by Dante Ferretti, and &quot;featured an imaginative use of lighting and mirrors in a spectacular display of some of the most important and impressive Pharaonic statues in the museum collection.&quot;

On April 1, 2015, a new layout of the museum was opened.

The new logo, the coordinated image and the exhibition system have been designed by the studio Migliore+Servetto Architects, whose founders, Ico Migliore and Mara Servetto, are creative advisor for the museum.

== Multaka network ==
In 2019, the museum joined six similar museums in Germany, the United Kingdom, Greece and Switzerland, creating the international Multaka network. This intercultural museum project organizes guided tours for refugees and migrants designed and offered for free by specially trained Arabic-speaking Multaka guides. The visitor-centered discussions with migrants in their language are focused on the historical origin and history of acquisition of cultural objects, including the visitors&#x27; own understanding of their country&#x27;s cultural heritage.

== Collection ==

There are more than 37,000 items in the museum, covering a period from the Paleolithic to the Coptic era. The most important are:

* the &#x27;Assemblea dei Re&#x27; (Kings Assembly), a term originally indicating a collection of statues representing all the kings of the New Kingdom
* the Temple of Ellesyia, donated as part of the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia
* sarcophagi, mummies and &quot;Books of the Dead&quot; originally belonging to the &quot;Drovetti collection&quot;
* a painted fabric from Gebelein dated at about 3500 BC, discovered in 1930 by Giulio Farina
* an ostracon of Prince Sethherkhepshef
* funerary paraphernalia from the &quot;Tomba di Ignoti&quot; (Tomb of Unknown) from the Old Kingdom
* the tomb of Kha and Merit (TT8), found intact by Schiaparelli in 1906 and transferred as a whole to the museum
* the Bembine Tablet
* the &#x27;Tomba dipinta&#x27; (Painted Tomb) usually closed to the public
* the papyrus collection room, originally collected by Drovetti and later used by Champollion during his studies for the decoding of the hieroglyphics
* the Turin King List (or Turin Royal Canon)
* the Turin Papyrus Map
* the Turin Erotic Papyrus
* the Judicial Papyrus of Turin

The Egyptian Museum owns three different versions of the Egyptian &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;, including the most ancient copy known. An integral illustrated version and the personal copy of the architect Kha, found by Schiaparelli in 1906, are normally shown to the public.

<text>Maggie Cassella is an American-Canadian actress, comedian and writer, best known for hosting the Canadian television talk show &quot;Because I Said So&quot; and founding the &quot;We&#x27;re Funny That Way!&quot; comedy festival.

==Biography==

Cassella&#x27;s double degree in philosophy and women&#x27;s studies led her to a position at a private boarding school in Connecticut teaching philosophy and religion. Finding that a private school teacher&#x27;s salary inadequate, she attended law school. After almost ten years as a lawyer dealing with cases involving people with AIDS, transitional issues around marriage and bringing a test case for gay adoption to Connecticut, Cassella quit the legal profession and began her comedy career.

Cassella&#x27;s stand-up comedy style was a mix of rants and raves. She found she could get an unlimited supply of material from just reading the news, Cassella settled in on her &quot;Because I Said So&quot; format of sit-down comedy tearing through news topics from law, entertainment, technology, religion, and finishing up with the things that she just found irritating. She has performed &quot;Because I Said So&quot; for 20 summers in Provincetown as well as in other places in North America.

Eventually, Cassella landed a full-time job and the love of her life. One of the original on-air talents on STAR!, she parlayed that job into her own talk show called &quot;Because I Said So.&quot;

&quot;BISS&quot;, as it was referred to around the station, allowed Cassella to have some fun and interview celebrities. She continues to do those interviews (even though &quot;BISS&quot; went bust) as a field producer during the Toronto International Film Festival for the syndicated US entertainment show &quot;Extra&quot;. Over the years, Cassella has interviewed comedy legends such as Phyllis Diller, Bea Arthur and Joan Rivers, as well as performers such as William H. Macy, Jude Law, Juliette Binoche, Robert Downey Jr., Laura Linney, Eartha Kitt, and k.d. lang.

In 2009, Cassella produced and hosted six episodes of &quot;The Vent!&quot;, a thirty-minute show she co-created and produced, that focuses on one topic from a variety of angles. Her production company, A Sweet Little Production Company, is located in Toronto and she continues to work on developing shows and films.

She is an out lesbian, and a frequent collaborator of US-based lesbian comedian Lea DeLaria. In addition to performing shows together, the duo have also cowritten a book and two screenplays. Cassella was a co-owner of The Flying Beaver Pubaret, a restaurant and performance venue on Parliament Street in Toronto&#x27;s Cabbagetown neighbourhood until a fire on February 20, 2015, caused the venue to close for good.

She voices Dr. Mulberry, who is the lesbian character in the 2019 version of &quot;Clifford the Big Red Dog&quot;.

<text>Hat Yai (, , also Haad Yai or Had Yai) is a city in southern Thailand near the Malaysian border and the fifth-largest city in Thailand with a population of 191,696 (2024) in the city municipality (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot; / city proper) itself and an urban population of 406,513 (2024) in the entire district of Amphoe Hat Yai. 

Hat Yai is the largest city of Southern Thailand and is part of the Greater Hat Yai-Songkhla Metropolitan Area (with a population of about 730,000) which include 2 big districts (Hat Yai, Mueang Songkhla) and 4 small neighboring districts (Bang Klam, Khlong Hoi Khong, Na Mom, Singhanakhon), forming the largest metropolitan area in the south, and the fourth-largest metropolitan area of the country. The city is often mistaken for being the provincial capital. In fact, Songkhla is the capital and the center of administration and culture while Hat Yai is the business center.

==History==
Originally named Khok Samet Chun (โคกเสม็ดชุน, &quot;shore eugenia knoll&quot;), Hat Yai was a small village until the southern railway was built there, making it one of the major rail hubs of the time. The junction which connected the town of Songkhla with the main route was formerly in the U Tapao area, but was later moved to Khok Samet Chun in 1922 when the U Tapao area turned out to be flood-prone. At that time, Khok Samet Chun had only four residents, but thanks to the investments of Khun Niphat Chinnakorn (the railway contractor for the railway line from Nakhon Si Thammarat to Pattani) it quickly grew into a small town.

In 1928, Hat Yai was made a community (&quot;chumchon&quot;), which was upgraded to a sanitary district (&quot;sukhaphiban&quot;) on December 11, 1935. It covered an area of , and was administered by the first mayor, Udom Bunlong. In 1938, the municipal administration building was completed. On March 16, 1949, Hat Yai was granted town status (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;). On May 10, 1961, the area covered by the municipality was increased to . As a result of the town&#x27;s continuing growth, on August 13, 1968, a larger, new municipal administration building was opened. On April 24, 1977, the total area of the municipality was enlarged for the second time to . Finally, in 1995, the town was upgraded to city status (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;). There are a total of 102 communities (&quot;chumchon&quot;), divided into 4 zones.

The name &quot;Hat Yai&quot; is a short version of &quot;mahat yai&quot;, meaning big mahat () tree, a relative of jackfruits in genus &quot;Artocarpus&quot;.

==Transportation==

In September or October at the Chinese Lunar festival, the Thai and Chinese present their offerings to the moon, &quot;queen of the heavens&quot;, in gratitude for past and future fortunes.

Hat Yai is also well known for its spectacular celebrations of the Chinese New Year festival. Although Thai elements have been incorporated (for example, Thai pop stars have been invited to perform), the celebration remains distinctively Chinese. “Despite being several generations removed from Hat Yai&#x27;s original Chinese pioneers, the New Year celebration provides strong evidence that the community is still influenced by and strongly identifies with its Chinese roots.

<doc id="482225" wikidata="Q6667628" url="?curid=482225" title="Login spoofing">
<text>Login spoofings are techniques used to steal a user&#x27;s password. The user is presented with an ordinary looking login prompt for username and password, which is actually a malicious program (usually called a Trojan horse) under the control of the attacker. When the username and password are entered, this information is logged or in some way passed along to the attacker, breaching security.

To prevent this, some operating systems require a special key combination (called a secure attention key) to be entered before a login screen is presented, for example Control-Alt-Delete. Users should be instructed to report login prompts that appear without having pressed this secure attention sequence. Only the kernel, which is the part of the operating system that interacts directly with the hardware, can detect whether the secure attention key has been pressed, so it cannot be intercepted by third party programs (unless the kernel itself has been compromised).

==Similarity to phishing==
While similar to login spoofing, phishing usually involves a scam in which victims respond to unsolicited e-mails that are either identical or similar in appearance to a familiar site which they may have prior affiliation with. Login spoofing usually is indicative of a much more heinous form of vandalism or attack in which case the attacker has already gained access to the victim computer to at least some degree.

==Internet==
Internet-based login spoofing can be caused by
* compromised sites

<text>A secure attention key (SAK) or secure attention sequence (SAS) is a special key or key combination to be pressed on a computer keyboard before a login screen which must, to the user, be completely trustworthy. The operating system kernel, which interacts directly with the hardware, is able to detect whether the secure attention key has been pressed. When this event is detected, the kernel starts the trusted login processing.

The secure attention key is designed to make login spoofing impossible, as the kernel will suspend any program, including those masquerading as the computer&#x27;s login process, before starting a trustable login operation.

<doc id="482235" wikidata="Q173180" url="?curid=482235" title="Franz Ferdinand (band)">
<text>Franz Ferdinand are a Scottish rock band formed in Glasgow in 2002. Their original line-up was composed of Alex Kapranos (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), Nick McCarthy (guitar, keyboards, vocals), Bob Hardy (bass guitar, percussion) and Paul Thomson (drums, percussion, backing vocals). Julian Corrie (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals) and Dino Bardot (guitar, backing vocals) joined the band in 2017 after McCarthy left during the previous year, and Audrey Tait (drums, percussion) joined the band after Thomson left in 2021. The band were categorised as a post-punk revival band and garnered multiple UK top 20 hits. They have been nominated for several Grammy Awards and have received two Brit Awards—winning one for Best British Group—as well as one NME Award.

The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Darts of Pleasure&quot;, just missed out on the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 44. Their second single, &quot;Take Me Out&quot;, proved their big commercial breakthrough, peaking at number three. &quot;Take Me Out&quot; charted in several other countries and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal; it became the band&#x27;s signature song. Their debut album &quot;Franz Ferdinand&quot; won the 2004 Mercury Prize and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Alternative Album.

In 2005, the band released their second studio album, &quot;You Could Have It So Much Better&quot;, produced by Rich Costey. It peaked within the top-ten in multiple countries and earned Grammy-nominations for Best Alternative Album and for one of the singles, &quot;Do You Want To&quot;. The band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;&quot;, was released in January 2009; by then the band had shifted from a post-punk-focused sound to a more dance-oriented sound. A remix album of &quot;Tonight&quot;, titled &quot;Blood&quot;, was released in July 2009.

Four years after the release of &quot;Tonight&quot;, the band released their fourth studio album, &quot;Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action&quot;, in August 2013. In 2015, Franz Ferdinand and American rock band Sparks formed the supergroup FFS and released a one-off album, &quot;FFS&quot;, in June 2015. The band underwent multiple line-up changes following &quot;FFS&quot;, beginning with McCarthy&#x27;s departure in 2016. After acquiring Corrie and Bardot, the band released their fifth studio album &quot;Always Ascending&quot; in February 2018. Thomson departed in 2021 and was replaced by Tait. The band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;The Human Fear&quot;, was released in January 2025 to commercial success. 

== History ==

=== Formation (2001–2003) ===

The band&#x27;s members played in various bands during the 1990s, including The Karelia, Yummy Fur, 10p Invaders, and Embryo. Alex Kapranos and Paul Thomson met at a party and began a close friendship and played together in Yummy Fur, and subsequently teamed up to write songs. Around the same time, Kapranos taught his friend Bob Hardy how to play bass after being given a bass guitar by Mick Cooke of Belle &amp; Sebastian. Kapranos met guitarist Nick McCarthy, who had returned to Scotland after studying jazz bass in Germany, in 2001.

Once the members came together, they settled on the name Franz Ferdinand for their band. The name was originally inspired by a racehorse called Archduke Ferdinand. After seeing the horse win the Northumberland Plate in 2001, the band began to discuss Archduke Franz Ferdinand and thought it would be a good band name because of the alliteration of the name and the implications of the Archduke&#x27;s death: his assassination was a significant factor in the lead-up to World War I. In an interview, Hardy recollected that &quot;mainly we just liked the way it sounded. We liked the alliteration.&quot; Kapranos continued, saying &quot;he was an incredible figure as well. His life, or at least the ending of it, was the catalyst for the complete transformation of the world and that is what we want our music to be. But I don&#x27;t want to over-intellectualise the name thing. Basically a name should just sound good ... like music.&quot; Thomson concluded, saying “I like the idea that, if we become popular, maybe the words Franz Ferdinand will make people think of the band instead of the historical figure.”

=== &quot;Franz Ferdinand&quot; and international breakthrough (2003–2005) ===

In May 2003 the band signed to Laurence Bell&#x27;s independent record label, Domino Recording Company. The band moved to Gula Studios in Malmö, Sweden, with Cardigans producer Tore Johansson to record their debut album. In the latter part of 2003, the band released their debut single, &quot;Darts of Pleasure&quot;. In January 2004, the single &quot;Take Me Out&quot; reached No. 3 in the UK charts. The album, &quot;Franz Ferdinand&quot;, was released in early 2004, debuting at No. 3 in the UK Albums Chart in February 2004, and at No. 12 in the Australian album charts in April 2004. The album only reached the lowest levels of the Billboard 200 album charts in the US as of early 2004, but reached the top 5 of the indie rock chart and the Heatseeker chart for debut artists. After a couple of North American tours and heavy rotation of the &quot;Take Me Out&quot; video on MTV, the album eventually reached No. 32 on the Billboard 200 later in 2004, and sold over a million copies in the United States. &quot;Franz Ferdinand&quot; received a generally strong positive response from critics. &quot;NME&quot; rated it 9 out of 10, and said that the band was the latest in the line of art school rock bands featuring the Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Roxy Music, the Sex Pistols, Wire, Travis and Blur.

On 7 September 2004, the album was awarded the 2004 Mercury Music Prize. &quot;Take Me Out&quot; gained first place in the Australian Triple J Hottest 100 for 2004, winning more than twice the votes of the second-place entry, with &quot;This Fire&quot; and &quot;The Dark of the Matinee&quot; entering at No. 24 and No. 50 respectively. Franz Ferdinand won an Ivor Novello Award in 2004 and two Brit Awards in 2005. The avant-garde music video for &quot;Take Me Out&quot; earned them a Breakthrough Video MTV Award. &quot;NME&quot; named &quot;Franz Ferdinand&quot; the best album of 2004, and placed it 38th on their &quot;100 Best Albums of All Time&quot; list. The band performed &quot;Take Me Out&quot; as a live medley with Los Lonely Boys, Maroon 5, The Black Eyed Peas and Gwen Stefani at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards in 2005, in which &quot;Take Me Out&quot; was nominated for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and &quot;Franz Ferdinand&quot; was nominated for Best Alternative Album. &quot;Take Me Out&quot; was featured on the video games &quot;NHL 2005&quot;, &quot;Madden NFL 2005&quot; and the breakthrough game &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;. The album has sold around 3.6 million copies worldwide.

=== &quot;You Could Have It So Much Better&quot; (2005–2007) ===
The band spent much of 2005 in the studio in Glasgow working on their follow-up album, &quot;You Could Have It So Much Better&quot;, which was released on 3 October 2005. The band initially intended to leave the album self-titled like their debut, but they changed it to &quot;You Could Have It So Much Better...With Franz Ferdinand&quot; before settling on the final title. The album&#x27;s cover design was modelled on Alexander Rodchenko&#x27;s 1924 portrait of Lilya Brik. The band attempted to broaden its musical range on the album; Hardy said, &quot;There&#x27;s more to life than disco-beat guitar music&quot;. It was generally well received in the press and seen as an album equal to, or better than, their first by most critics. It entered the UK Album Charts at Number 1 and the US charts at Number 8. The album eventually sold 2 million copies worldwide.

To support the album, four singles were released. Included in that set is a double A-side single that contained a video-clip-only single as well (both the AA-side &quot;L. Wells&quot; and the video-clip &quot;Jeremy Fraser&quot; are not featured on the album, recorded in early 2006 during the band&#x27;s tour of Australia in support of the album). Also included is another video-clip-only single called &quot;Wine, In the Afternoon&quot; which is the B-side to &quot;Eleanor Put Your Boots On&quot;, and was also not featured on the album, but recorded on tour in Michigan. &quot;Do You Want To&quot; made it to number 4 and was declared by Q to be the greatest single of 2005, while &quot;Walk Away&quot; and &quot;The Fallen&quot; entered the top 15 of the UK Singles Chart. The fourth and final single from the second album, &quot;Eleanor Put Your Boots On&quot;, peaked at number 30. &quot;You Could Have It So Much Better&quot; went on to earn a nomination for Best Alternative Album at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards in 2006, as did &quot;Do You Want To&quot; for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.

=== &quot;Tonight: Franz Ferdinand&quot; (2007–2011) ===
On 26 January 2009, the band released their third studio album, &quot;&quot;, which they had been recording in Glasgow since mid-2007. The band recorded the album in a disused building in Glasgow that had been a town hall in the past. Alex Kapranos has stated that &quot;The last record was...like a teenager having sex. This one&#x27;s a bit more assured and a bit friendlier for the dance floor.&quot;
Tonight was mixed by Canadian Mix Engineer Mike Fraser. The song &quot;Ulysses&quot; was chosen to be the first single and was released on 19 January 2009. It was first played by Zane Lowe on 17 November 2008. Shortly afterwards it hit YouTube. It did not see that much success in the UK Top 40, reaching only No. 20, but it fared better in Spain and Japan where it reached No. 2 and No. 3, respectively. It also entered the Top 20 of the US Modern Rock Chart. The album, &quot;Tonight&quot; was released 26 January 2009 and debuted at No. 2 in the UK Album Chart and No. 9 in the US Billboard 200. The second single, &quot;No You Girls&quot; saw success both in the charts and on the radio prior to release, eventually reaching No. 7 on the US Modern Rock Chart and was performed by Franz Ferdinand on Comic Relief 2009 Top of The Pops special. &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Feeling&quot; was released on 6 July as the third single from the album and on 28 August, &quot;What She Came For&quot; was released as the 4th single in the form of a remix single. The band performed &quot;What She Came For&quot; on &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; on Wednesday, 26 August 2009.

The band appeared on Radio 1&#x27;s live lounge performing their second single &quot;No You Girls&quot;, and did a cover of Britney Spears&#x27; comeback single &quot;Womanizer&quot;. In February 2009, Glastonbury Festival announced Franz Ferdinand as the first major band playing at that year&#x27;s festival. The band also unveiled a 19-date tour of the US during the spring, in support of the new album. The tour included a set at the Coachella Festival. The band were also one of the main stage acts performing at Radio 1&#x27;s Big Weekend in Swindon in May. On 6 May 2009, it was announced that Franz Ferdinand would be the third opening act for the Green Day&#x27;s 21st Century Breakdown World Tour. They played 8–26 August 2009, and they followed Kaiser Chiefs and The Bravery.

On 1 June 2009, the band released &quot;&quot;, a compilation album that includes dub music versions of songs from &quot;Tonight: Franz Ferdinand&quot;. The release was timed to coincide with Record Store Day. &quot;iTunes Festival: London 2009&quot;, iTunes Store exclusive, was released in June as well.

Also made for the Record Store Day, on 16 April 2011 Domino released the compilation &quot;Covers E.P.&quot;, which featured songs of &quot;Tonight: Franz Ferdinand&quot; played by Peaches, LCD Soundsystem, Stephin Merritt, ESG and Debbie Harry (who recorded in duet with the band). The first edition was only vinyl, and on 2 May 2011 it was released on CD.

=== &quot;Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action&quot; and &quot;FFS&quot; with Sparks (2012–2015) ===

Writing for a fourth studio album began in 2010. Kapranos stated that the band promised themselves they would also focus on not over-publicising their progress as he felt that&#x27;s something he regretted about their previous album. In May 2012, the band returned to touring, playing several festivals during the summer of 2012 including a headlining slot at Field Day festival in London&#x27;s Victoria Park. Other appearances included Barcelona&#x27;s Primavera Sound Festival, Montreal&#x27;s 2012 Osheaga Music Festival, Chicago&#x27;s 2012 Lollapalooza Music Festival, Belgium&#x27;s Dour Festival, Portugal&#x27;s Marés Vivas Festival and San Francisco&#x27;s 2012 Outside Lands Music Festival.

During their 2012 tour, the band gradually introduced new songs to their repertoire, along with a reworked version of &quot;Tonight&quot; cut &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Feeling&quot; combined with &quot;I Feel Love&quot; by Donna Summer. In March 2013, Franz Ferdinand continued touring and premiering new songs. In early March they performed &quot;Evil Eye&quot; and &quot;Love Illumination&quot;, while the end of the month saw the live premiere of &quot;Goodbye Lovers &amp; Friends&quot;. On 16 May 2013, Franz Ferdinand officially announced their fourth album, titled &quot;Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action&quot;, along with cover art, track listing and a release date of 26 August 2013. The band launched the new album at a show at the Electric Brixton. FMV Magazine&#x27;s Dan Jenko praised the gig, saying that &quot;there&#x27;s no reason why latest LP &quot;Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action&quot; can&#x27;t be the belated soundtrack of the summer&quot;.

On 9 March 2015, it was announced that the band had formed a supergroup with Sparks under the name FFS, with plans to release a studio album and tour Europe during that summer. A teaser titled &quot;The Domino Effect&quot; was released on the group&#x27;s YouTube channel that same day. The John Congleton-produced album, &quot;FFS&quot;, was officially announced on 1 April 2015. Three official singles were released from the album: &quot;Johnny Delusional&quot;, which was released on 13 April, &quot;Call Girl&quot;, which was released on 28 May, and &quot;Police Encounters&quot;, which was released on 23 October.

===Line-up change and &quot;Always Ascending&quot; (2016–2020)===

In July 2016, the band announced that guitarist Nick McCarthy would not be involved in the recording and touring of their next album, in order to concentrate on his family and other musical interests. The band, however, have stressed that it is possible he may rejoin the band at a later date. On 14 October 2016, the band released &quot;Demagogue&quot;, a song protesting and satirising the candidacy of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election of 2016. It was released as part of the &quot;30 Days, 50 Songs&quot; programme that featured 50 songs lyrically against Trump and his candidacy.

On 19 May 2017, two days prior to the start of their North American tour, Franz Ferdinand announced their new five-piece line-up, with former Yummy Fur and 1990s member Dino Bardot on guitar and Julian Corrie on keyboards, synth and guitar. On 25 October, the band released the single &quot;Always Ascending&quot; from their fifth studio album, &quot;Always Ascending&quot; (2018). They revealed the album&#x27;s release date, 9 February 2018, and announced dates for a world tour. Corrie joined the band for the recording sessions of the album, while Bardot joined after recording was completed.

===Departure of Thomson, &quot;Hits to the Head&quot; and &quot;The Human Fear&quot; (2021–present)===
On 21 October 2021, the band announced through social media that Paul Thomson had departed the band, with Glasgow-based drummer Audrey Tait joining as his replacement, as well as confirming that studio recordings had been undertaken with Tait. The announcement was accompanied by a statement from Thomson and a photograph of him passing his drumsticks to Tait. Tait&#x27;s debut performance with the band had taken place several weeks before the announcement, at the Balmain fashion show in Paris on 29 September.

Franz Ferdinand released a new single, &quot;Billy Goodbye&quot;, on 2 November 2021. The track is one of two new songs on the greatest hits compilation &quot;Hits to the Head&quot;, which was released on 11 March 2022.

Franz Ferdinand performed at Night for Ukraine, a fundraising benefit held at the Roundhouse in north London on the evening of March 9, 2022, with the funds raised being donated to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal, to provide aid to people fleeing Ukraine following the Russian invasion. The event was organised by Fabien Riggall in collaboration with the Ukrainian pop duo Bloom Twins.

On 11 September 2024, Franz Ferdinand announced their sixth studio album, &quot;The Human Fear&quot;, to be released on 10 January 2025. The lead single, &quot;Audacious&quot;, was released following the announcement of the album. The album will be the first full-length album to feature Audrey Tait on drums following the departure of Paul Thomson. The band will tour the UK and Europe in the first half of 2025, beginning on 14 February in Lisbon and concluding in Glasgow on 7 March.

== Collaborations and covers ==

Franz Ferdinand covered the LCD Soundsystem song &quot;All My Friends&quot; which appeared as a B-side on the single and LCD Soundsystem covered their song Live Alone in return, which appeared on a covers EP alongside Stephin Merritt, ESG and Debbie Harry who all covered songs from &quot;Tonight&quot;. They have also covered &quot;Sexy Boy&quot; by Air, &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Long&quot; by the Beatles, Pulp&#x27;s &quot;Mis-Shapes&quot;, Gwen Stefani&#x27;s top 5 hit &quot;What You Waiting For?&quot;, Blondie&#x27;s &quot;Call Me&quot;, Britney Spears&#x27; &quot;Womanizer&quot; and David Bowie&#x27;s song &quot;Sound and Vision&quot;, featuring Girls Aloud on backing vocals, for a compilation disc marking the 40th anniversary of BBC Radio 1, along with other leading artists. Additionally, Franz Ferdinand recorded a cover of the Fire Engines&#x27; song &quot;Get Up and Use Me&quot;. In return, the Fire Engines recorded a cover of &quot;Jacqueline&quot;. The band also took a similar approach with Dutch band De Kift, covering the song &quot;Heisa-Ho&quot; whilst De Kift recorded a cover of &quot;Love and Destroy&quot; with Dutch lyrics. The cover by De Kift is named &quot;Liefde En Puin&quot; which is the title &quot;Love and Destroy&quot; translated into Dutch. The band has had remixes by electronic artists Daft Punk, Hot Chip, Justice, The Avalanches, Microfilm and Erol Alkan.

The band also performed, played and recorded with Jane Birkin, covering the Serge Gainsbourg song &quot;Sorry Angel&quot; for the 2005 album &quot;Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited&quot;. In addition, Franz re-recorded the track &quot;Brown Onions&quot; for David Shrigley&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Worried Noodles&quot;. The band kept instrumentation identical but used lyrics written by Shrigley which include the consistent repetition of the word &quot;No&quot; and occasionally &quot;No brains, no teeth, no legs, no eyes...&quot;. Hot Chip, a band who are reported to be a favourite of Franz Ferdinand, also performed their own version of &quot;No&quot; on the same album. The band partnered with Sony in Tokyo, filming commercials for the launch of the A Series Walkman music player on 8 September 2005. A limited edition Franz Ferdinand-themed Walkman A Series player was released by Sony Japan in January 2006, with only one hundred made.

The band &#x27;met&#x27; Gorillaz in December 2005 and interviewed each other for a feature in &quot;Observer Music Monthly&quot;. At the 2009 NME Awards ceremony, they performed a cover of Blondie&#x27;s &quot;Call Me&quot; with Elly Jackson of La Roux on guest vocals. When the band appeared on Radio 1&#x27;s Live Lounge on 6 April 2009, to promote &quot;No You Girls&quot;, they covered &quot;Womanizer&quot; by Britney Spears. They have also collaborated with Marion Cotillard for the 2010 Lady Dior campaign. The band wrote the lyrics and plays the music for the song &quot;The Eyes of Mars&quot;, while the actress is on vocals. Kapranos noted that it was refreshing working with her as she had a lot of fun going and retrying the song time and time again. In 2010, Franz Ferdinand contributed to the &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; soundtrack with their adaption of the song &quot;The Lobster Quadrille&quot;. Later that year, Kapranos and McCarthy collaborated on the song &quot;Do It Again&quot; with Edwyn Collins on his album &quot;Losing Sleep&quot;.

In 2016, Alex Kapranos took part in a documentary about Glasgow music and Chemikal Underground Records called &quot;Lost in France&quot;. The film was directed by Niall McCann and brought Kapranos (along with members of The Delgados, Mogwai and others) to Mauron, Brittany, to recreate a gig they played when Kapranos was in his earlier band, The Karelia. The film features Kapranos playing live with Stuart Braithwaite of Mogwai, and other musicians such as Emma Pollock and RM Hubbert, and Holy Mountain, as well as interviews with Kapranos and his old label-mates. &quot;Lost in France&quot; premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival to wholly positive reviews and was called &quot;funny, vital and sobering&quot; by Scotland&#x27;s arts bible &quot;The Skinny&quot;. In 2022, Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s single, &quot;This Fire&quot; served as the opening theme song for the Polish-Japanese animated series, &quot;.&quot;

==Style==
===Music and art===

Stylistically, the band has been labelled as indie rock, garage rock revival, post-punk revival, dance-punk, dance-rock and art rock. The band is notable for its use of Russian avant-garde imagery in album and single covers designed by Matthew Cooper. Examples include: &quot;You Could Have It So Much Better&quot;, which references a 1924 portrait of Lilya Brik by Alexander Rodchenko; &quot;Take Me Out&quot;, which references &quot;One-Sixth Part of the World,&quot; also by Alexander Rodchenko; &quot;This Fire&quot; which references &quot;Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge&quot; by El Lissitzky; and &quot;Michael&quot;, with single art based on &quot;A Proun&quot; by Lissitzky. The song &quot;Love and Destroy&quot; was inspired by the scene of disorder made by Margarita, a character of Michael Bulgakov&#x27;s &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;, in the apartment of the literature critic Latunzky.

Also, in &quot;Outsiders&quot;, the lyrics &quot;In seventeen years will you still be Camille, Lee Miller, Gala or whatever&quot; are a reference to the lovers of the artists Auguste Rodin, Man Ray and Salvador Dalí.

The band have been credited with helping to increase the popularity of men&#x27;s fringed hairstyles.

=== Music videos ===
Many of the videos to promote the band&#x27;s singles take inspiration from Russian avant-garde much like their LP and CD sleeves.

The avant-garde music video for &quot;Take Me Out&quot;, directed by Jonas Odell, was inspired by Dadaism (especially Max Ernst&#x27;s &quot;Une Semaine de Bonté&quot;), Busby Berkeley choreographies and Russian constructivist design. Alex Kapranos explained the many and varied influences behind the 1930s-style promo for second single &quot;Take Me Out&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s kind of two dimensional in a three dimensional style if that makes any sense. It&#x27;s a montage of images; ourselves, pictures and things taken from other places and put together in a strange, abstract way. That&#x27;s what gives the video that strange, jerky, style&quot;.

The lyrics of &quot;Do You Want To&quot; make reference to parties at the &quot;trendy&quot; Glasgow art gallery Transmission, and the video includes a variety of the work of contemporary artist Vanessa Beecroft.

<text>Mariefred is a locality situated in Strängnäs Municipality, Södermanland County, Sweden with 7,121 inhabitants in 2023.

The name is derived from that of the former Carthusian monastery in the city, Mariefred Charterhouse, and means &quot;Peace of Mary&quot; (the previous name being Gripsholm). It lies roughly 50 kilometres west of Stockholm by lake Mälaren.

Mariefred is, despite its small population, for historical reasons often still referred to as a &quot;city&quot;. Statistics Sweden, however, only counts localities with more than 10,000 inhabitants as cities.

Gripsholm Castle is located in the town. Adjacent to the castle is the nature reserve and deer park Gripsholms hjorthage.

Gripsholms kungsladugård, an old barn of Gripsholm Castle, housed a centre for fine arts printmaking called &quot;Grafikens Hus,&quot; the largest of its kind in Sweden at the time, before being destroyed in a fire in 2014.

The East Södermanland Railway has a railway museum in the city with one of the finest collections of 600 mm narrow-gauge passenger railcars anywhere.

Kurt Tucholsky, a famous German author, is buried in the town cemetery.

==Notable natives==
Swedish pop and jazz singer Lisa Ekdahl was raised in Mariefred.

Swedish actor Dolph Lundgren has a summer home in Mariefred, Kalkudden.

Mikael Samuelsson, a former professional ice hockey player in the NHL, was born in Mariefred. Samuelsson is a member of the exclusive Triple Gold Club, having won the Stanley Cup, Olympics, and World Championship.

<doc id="482238" wikidata="Q159139" url="?curid=482238" title="Mozhaysk">
<text>Mozhaysk (, ) is a town and the administrative center of Mozhaysky District in Moscow Oblast, Russia, located to the west of Moscow, on the historic road leading to Smolensk and then to Poland. Population: 

==History==
First mentioned in 1231 as an appanage of Chernigov; A theory says Mozhaysk took its name from the Mozhay (Mozhaya) River, whose name could be of Baltic origin (compare Lithuanian &quot;mažoji&quot; &quot;small&quot; - in contrast to the larger Moskva River nearby). Later Mozhaysk became an important stronghold of the Smolensk dynasty, in the 13th century ruled by Duke (later Saint) Theodore the Black. Muscovites seized Mozhaysk in 1303, but in the course of the following century had serious troubles defending it against Algirdas (Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1345 to 1377). A younger brother of the ruling Grand Duke of Moscow usually held the Principality of Mozhaysk - until the practice was dropped in 1493. In 1562 Denmark and Russia signed the Treaty of Mozhaysk there during the Livonian War of 1558–1583. In 1708 the administration of Peter the Great granted town status to Mozhaysk.

Mozhaysk played a role in defending the Western approaches to Moscow in the 19th and 20th centuries. During the French invasion of Russia in 1812 the Battle of Borodino took place from the town.

In World War II, the German Wehrmacht took Mozhaysk on October  18, 1941; the Soviet Red Army re-captured it on January 20, 1942.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Mozhaysk serves as the administrative center of Mozhaysky District. As an administrative division, it is, together with twenty-one rural localities, incorporated within Mozhaysky District as the Town of Mozhaysk. As a municipal division, the Town of Mozhaysk is incorporated within Mozhaysky Municipal District as Mozhaysk Urban Settlement.

==Architecture==
The first stone cathedral was built in the kremlin in the early 14th century and named Nikolskiy (then Staro-Nikolsky) Cathedral. It very much resembled the Dormition Cathedral in Zvenigorod. At that time the wooden statue of Saint Nicholas of Mozhaysk was carved by an unknown master and placed into the cathedral. Later the statue was moved to the Church Over-the-gates.

The first fortified Detinets existed in the Mozhaysk as early as in the 12th century. After the great fire of 1541, it was completely rebuilt by an order of Ivan the Terrible. Only in the early 17th century, the stone fortress was constructed, replaced with the Kremlin made of bricks in 1624–1626.

The Cathedral of St. Nicholas in the Gothic Revival style, designed by Aleksei Bakarev (Matvei Kazakov&#x27;s student), started in 1802, but the building was ransacked by the retreating French troops in 1812. Only in 1814 the cathedral was completed and consecrated. The church of St. Joachim and Anna preserves some parts from the early 15th century. Another important landmark is the Luzhetsky Monastery, founded in 1408 by St. Ferapont and rebuilt in brick in the 16th century. The monastery cathedral, erected during the reign of Vasily III, was formerly known for its frescoes, ascribed to Dionisius&#x27; circle.

==Trivia==
Mozhaysk was frequently the last major obstacle on the way to the capital and it gave birth to the expression &quot;to push beyond Mozhay&quot; (, &quot;zagnat&#x27; za Mozhay&quot;), which literally means &quot;to push (the enemy) beyond Mozhay&quot;. In modern usage, it means to &quot;completely crush the enemy and push them away at a great distance&quot;. The phrase originated during the Polish Muscovite War when the Polish Army retreated to Mozhaysk following the Battle of Moscow (1612).

==Transport==

Bus line 457 goes from the Mozhaysk autobus station to Park Pobedy in Moscow. Several bus and marshrutka services operate within Mozhaysk and connect the town with nearby localities, as well as with touristic sites in the fields of Borodino.
Railway transport is also available. Suburban regular and express trains run between Mozhaysk railway station and Moscow. The minor railway platform Km. 109 of the Belorussky suburban railway line, located on the outskirts of the city, serves the adjacement settlement of Stroitel. Mozhaysk is also linked by train to Smolensk Oblast, with both short-distance services between the town and Vyazma and long-distance Lastochka trains on the Moscow-Smolensk route stopping at Mozhaysk.

<doc id="482281" wikidata="Q4862496" url="?curid=482281" title="Baron Hotham">
<text>Baron Hotham, of South Dalton in the County of York, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1797 for the naval commander Admiral William Hotham, with remainder to the heirs male of his father. Hotham was the third son of Sir Beaumont Hotham, 7th Baronet, of Scorborough (see below), and in 1811 he also succeeded his nephew as eleventh Baronet. Lord Hotham never married and on his death in 1813 he was succeeded in both titles by his younger brother Beaumont, the second Baron and twelfth Baronet. He had previously represented Wigan in the House of Commons.

Beaumont Hotham, 3rd Baron Hotham, grandson of the second Baron, fought at the Battle of Waterloo and was later a General in the Army and sat as a Member of Parliament. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his nephew, the fourth Baron, the son of Rear-Admiral George Frederick Hotham, brother of the third Baron. He, like his successor and younger brother, the fifth Baron, died unmarried. The latter was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the sixth Baron. He was the son of Reverend William Francis Hotham, second son of the second Baron.

On the death of the sixth Baron, that line of the family also failed and the titles passed to his first cousin twice removed, the seventh Baron. He was the great-grandson of the third son of the third Baron. the titles are held by his third son, the eighth Baron, who succeeded in 1967.

The Baronetcy, of Scorborough in the County of York, was created in the Baronetage of England in 1622 for John Hotham. Both he and his son, John Hotham the younger, were beheaded by the Parliamentarians in 1645. The title was inherited by the latter&#x27;s son John, the second Baronet. Both he and his son, the third Baronet, represented Beverley in Parliament. The third Baron was succeeded by his cousin, the fourth Baronet. He sat as Member of Parliament for Scarborough and Beverley. His son, the fifth Baronet, also represented Beverley in the House of Commons. He was succeeded by his son, the sixth Baronet.

On his death in 1767 the line of the fifth Baronet failed and the title passed to the late Baronet&#x27;s uncle, the seventh Baronet. His eldest son, the eighth Baronet, a Lieutenant-General in the Army, represented St Ives in Parliament and also assumed the additional surname of Thompson. When he died the titles passed to his younger brother, the ninth Baronet. He served as Lord Bishop of Clogher. He was succeeded by his son, the tenth Baronet. On his death in 1811 the title was inherited by the aforementioned eleventh Baronet, who had already been elevated to the peerage as Baron Hotham.

The family seat is Dalton Hall, Beverley, East Riding of Yorkshire.

<text>Spot &quot;Spotty&quot; Fetcher (March 17, 1989 – February 21, 2004) was U.S. President George W. Bush&#x27;s dog. She was an English Springer Spaniel, named after Scott Fletcher, a baseball player with the Major League Baseball team Texas Rangers, a team George W. Bush owned before becoming Governor of Texas in 1994.

Born in the White House, she was the daughter of Millie, who had belonged to President George H. W. Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush. Her father was Tug Farish from Lane&#x27;s End Farm in Kentucky, better known for its thoroughbred horse breeding program.

She was euthanized after suffering a series of strokes. She was 14 years old.

Spot is the only presidential pet to have lived in the White House under two presidents, the two being George H. W. Bush and his son, George W. Bush.

George had a dog at the time of her death, Barney, who became a popular figure for the US, and later another dog, Miss Beazley, who was born eight months after Spot&#x27;s death.

<text>Bressay is a populated island in the Shetland archipelago of Scotland.

==Geography and geology==
Bressay lies due south of Whalsay, west of the Isle of Noss, and north of Mousa. With an area of , it is the fifth-largest island in Shetland. The population is around 360 people, concentrated in the middle of the west coast, around Glebe and Fullaburn.

The island is made up of Old Red Sandstone with some basaltic intrusions. Bressay was quarried extensively for building materials, used all over Shetland, especially in nearby Lerwick. There are a number of sea caves and arches. The largest of eleven lochs on the island are the Loch of Grimsetter in the east, and the Loch of Brough.

==Wildlife==
Bressay has a large number of migrant birds, especially in the east. The Loch of Grimsetter is a haven for waders and whooper swans. In the far south, there is a colony of Arctic skuas. The southern half of the island has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International.

==History==
The name of the island may have been recorded in 1263 as &#x27;Breiðoy&#x27; (Old Norse &quot;broad island&quot;). In a 1490 document the island is referred to as &quot;Brwsøy&quot; – &quot;Brusi&#x27;s island&quot; which name may indicate it was the 11th century base for Earl of Orkney Brusi Sigurdsson. This possibility is supported by a later reference to his son Rögnvald as &quot;Lord of the Shetlanders&quot; and Thompson (2008) is in &quot;no doubt &quot; that Shetland specifically was in Brusi&#x27;s possession during his joint earldom with his brothers.

The Bressay Stone is an outstanding example of Pictish art.

:&quot;a slab of chlorite slate, about wide at the top, tapering to less than a foot [300 mm] at the bottom.&quot;

The slender sides are engraved with ogham, and the two faces with various examples of knotwork, and imagery. The top of each face has a cross. On one side, there is an engraving of two men with crosiers, as well as various animals including horses, pigs, and what appears to be someone in the process of being swallowed by two sea monsters. It has been suggested that this is Jonah.

During World War I and II gun emplacements were built to guard Bressay Sound.

==Infrastructure==
Attractions on the island include Bressay Lighthouse. At Maryfield there is a heritage centre, a hotel and the old laird&#x27;s mansion, Gardie House, built in 1724.

Frequent car ferries sail from Maryfield to Lerwick on the Shetland Mainland. During the summer months, a passenger ferry service links the east coast of Bressay with the nature reserve Isle of Noss.

Lerwick and Bressay Parish Church (of the Church of Scotland) has three places of worship. The Bressay Church building is located close to the Marina, near the centre of the west coast of the island.

<doc id="482302" wikidata="Q184004" url="?curid=482302" title="Muskox">
<text>The muskox (Ovibos moschatus) is a hoofed mammal of the family Bovidae. Native to the Arctic, it is noted for its thick coat and for the strong odor emitted by males during the seasonal rut, from which its name derives. This musky odor has the effect of attracting females during mating season. Its Inuktitut name &quot;umingmak&quot; translates to &quot;the bearded one&quot;.

Its Woods Cree names &quot;mâthi-môs&quot; and &quot;mâthi-mostos&quot; translate to &quot;ugly moose&quot; and &quot;ugly bison&quot;, respectively. In historic times, muskoxen primarily lived in Greenland and the Canadian Arctic of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. They were formerly present in Eurasia, with their youngest natural records in the region dating to around 2,700 years ago, with reintroduced populations in the American state of Alaska, the Canadian territory of Yukon, and Siberia, and an introduced population in Norway, part of which emigrated to Sweden, where a small population now lives.

== Evolution ==

=== Extant relatives ===

The muskox is in the subtribe Ovibovina (or tribe Ovibovini) in the tribe Caprini (or subfamily Caprinae) of the subfamily Antilopinae in the family Bovidae. It is therefore more closely related to sheep and goats than to oxen; it is placed in its own genus, &quot;Ovibos&quot; (Latin: &quot;sheep-ox&quot;). It is one of the two largest extant members of the caprines, along with the similarly sized Takin &quot;Budorcas&quot;. While the takin and muskox were once considered possibly closely related, the takin lacks common ovibovine features, such as the muskox&#x27;s specialized horn morphology, and genetic analysis shows that their lineages actually separated early in caprine evolution. Instead, the muskox&#x27;s closest living relatives appear to be the gorals of the genus &quot;Naemorhedus&quot;, nowadays common in many countries of central and east Asia. The vague similarity between takin and muskox is therefore an example of convergent evolution.

=== Fossil history and extinct relatives ===

The modern muskox is the last member of a line of ovibovines that first evolved in temperate regions of Asia and adapted to a cold tundra environment late in its evolutionary history. Muskox ancestors with sheep-like high-positioned horns (horn cores being mostly over the plane of the frontal bones, rather than below them as in modern muskoxen) first left the temperate forests for the developing grasslands of Central Asia during the Pliocene, expanding into Siberia and the rest of northern Eurasia. Later migration waves of Asian ungulates that included high-horned muskoxen reached Europe and North America during the first half of the Pleistocene. The first well known muskox, the &quot;shrub-ox&quot; &quot;Euceratherium&quot;, crossed to North America over an early version of the Bering Land Bridge two million years ago and prospered in the American southwest and Mexico. &quot;Euceratherium&quot; was larger yet more lightly built than modern muskoxen, resembling a giant sheep with massive horns, and preferred hilly grasslands.

A genus with intermediate horns, &quot;Soergelia&quot;, inhabited Eurasia in the early Pleistocene, from Spain to Siberia, and crossed to North America during the Irvingtonian (1.8 million years to 240,000 years ago), soon after &quot;Euceratherium&quot;. Unlike &quot;Euceratherium&quot;, which survived in America until the Pleistocene-Holocene extinction event, &quot;Soergelia&quot; was a lowland dweller which disappeared fairly early, displaced by more advanced ungulates, such as the &quot;giant muskox&quot; &quot;Praeovibos&quot; (literally &quot;before &quot;Ovibos&quot;&quot;). The low-horned &quot;Praeovibos&quot; was present in Europe and the Mediterranean 1.5 million years ago, colonized Alaska and the Yukon one million years ago and disappeared half a million years ago. &quot;Praeovibos&quot; was a highly adaptable animal apparently associated with cold tundra (reindeer) and temperate woodland (red deer) faunas alike. During the Mindel glaciation 500,000 years ago, &quot;Praeovibos&quot; was present in the Kolyma river area in eastern Siberia in association with many Ice Age megafauna that would later coexist with &quot;Ovibos&quot;, in the Kolyma itself and elsewhere, including wild horses, reindeer, woolly mammoth and stag-moose. It is debated, however, if &quot;Praeovibos&quot; was directly ancestral to &quot;Ovibos&quot;, or both genera descended from a common ancestor, since the two occurred together during the middle Pleistocene. Defenders of ancestry from &quot;Praeovibos&quot; have proposed that &quot;Praeovibos&quot; evolved into &quot;Ovibos&quot; in one region during a period of isolation and expanded later, replacing the remaining populations of &quot;Praeovibos&quot;.

Two more &quot;Praeovibos&quot;-like genera were named in America in the 19th century, &quot;Bootherium&quot; and &quot;Symbos&quot;, which are now identified as the male and female forms of a single, sexually dimorphic species, the &quot;woodland muskox&quot;, &quot;Bootherium bombifrons&quot;. &quot;Bootherium&quot; inhabited open woodland areas of North America during the late Pleistocene, from Alaska to Texas and maybe even Mexico, but was most common in the Southern United States, while &quot;Ovibos&quot; replaced it in the tundra-steppe to the north, immediately south of the Laurentian ice sheet.

Modern &quot;Ovibos&quot; appeared in Germany almost one million years ago and was common in the region through the Pleistocene. By the Mindel, muskoxen had also reached the British Isles. Both Germany and Britain were just south of the Scandinavian ice sheet and covered in tundra during cold periods, but Pleistocene muskoxen are also rarely recorded in more benign and wooded areas to the south like France and Green Spain, where they coexisted with temperate ungulates like red deer and aurochs. Likewise, the muskox is known to have survived in Britain during warm interglacial periods.

Today&#x27;s muskoxen are descended from others believed to have migrated from Siberia to North America between 200,000 and 90,000 years ago, having previously occupied Alaska (at the time united to Siberia and isolated periodically from the rest of North America by the union of the Laurentide and Cordilleran Ice Sheets during colder periods) between 250,000 and 150,000 years ago. After migrating south during one of the warmer periods of the Illinoian glaciation, non-Alaskan American muskoxen would be isolated from the rest in the colder periods. The muskox was already present in its current stronghold of Banks Island 34,000 years ago, but the existence of other ice-free areas in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago at the time is disputed.

Along with the bison and the pronghorn, the muskox was one of a few species of Pleistocene megafauna in North America to survive the Pleistocene/Holocene extinction event and live to the present day. The muskox is thought to have been able to survive the last glacial period by finding ice-free areas (refugia) away from prehistoric peoples.

Fossil DNA evidence suggests that muskoxen were not only more geographically widespread during the Pleistocene, but also more genetically diverse. During that time, other populations of muskoxen lived across the Arctic, from the Ural Mountains to Greenland. By contrast, the current genetic makeup of the species is more homogenous. Climate fluctuation may have affected this shift in genetic diversity: research indicates colder periods in Earth&#x27;s history are correlated with more diversity, and warmer periods with more homogeneity. Muskox populations survived into the Holocene in Siberia, with their youngest records in the region being from the Taymyr Peninsula, dating to around 2,700 years ago (~700 BC).

== Physical characteristics ==

Both male and female muskoxen have long, curved horns. Muskoxen stand high at withers, with females measuring in length, and the larger males . The small tail, often concealed under a layer of fur, measures only long. Adults, on average, weigh , but can range from . The thick coat and large head suggest a larger animal than the muskox truly is; the bison, to which the muskox is often compared, can weigh up to twice as much. However, heavy zoo-kept specimens have weighed up to . Their coat, a mix of black, gray and brown, includes long guard hairs that almost reach the ground. Rare &quot;white muskoxen&quot; have been spotted in the Queen Maud Gulf Bird Sanctuary. Muskoxen are occasionally semi-domesticated for wool, and rarely for meat and milk. The U.S. state of Alaska has several muskoxen farms specifically aimed at wool harvesting. The wool, called &quot;qiviut&quot;, is highly prized for its softness, length, and insulation value. Prices for yarn range between .

A muskox can reach speeds of up to . Their life expectancy is between 12 and 20 years.

=== Prehistory ===
During the Pleistocene period, muskoxen were much more widespread. Fossil evidence shows that they lived across the Siberian and North American Arctic, from the Urals to Greenland. The ancestors of today&#x27;s muskoxen came across the Bering Land Bridge to North America between 200,000 and 90,000 years ago. During the Wisconsinan, modern muskox thrived in the tundra south of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, in what is now the Midwest, the Appalachians and Virginia, while distant relatives &quot;Bootherium&quot; and &quot;Euceratherium&quot; lived in the forests of the Southern United States and the western shrubland, respectively. Though they were always less common than other Ice Age megafauna, muskox abundance peaked during the Würm II glaciation 20,000 years ago and declined afterwards, especially during the Pleistocene/Holocene extinction event, where its range was greatly reduced and only the populations in North America survived. The last known muskox population in Europe died out in Sweden 9,000 years ago. In Asia, muskox persisted until just 615-555 BCE in Tumat, Sakha Republic.

Following the disappearance of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, the muskox gradually moved north across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, arriving in Greenland from Ellesmere Island at about 350 AD, during the late Holocene. Their arrival in northwestern Greenland probably occurred within a few hundred years of the arrival of the Dorset and Thule cultures in the present-day Qaanaaq area. Human predation around Qaanaaq may have restricted muskoxen from moving down the west coast, and instead kept them confined to the northeastern fringes of the island.

=== Recent native range in North America ===
In modern times, muskoxen were restricted to the Arctic areas of Northern Canada, Greenland, and Alaska. The Alaskan population was wiped out in the late 19th or early 20th century. Their depletion has been attributed to excessive hunting, but an adverse change in climate may have contributed. However, muskoxen have since been reintroduced to Alaska. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service introduced the muskox onto Nunivak Island in 1935 to support subsistence living. Other reintroduced populations are in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, Yukon&#x27;s Ivvavik National Park, a wildlife conservation center in Anchorage, Aulavik National Park in Northwest Territories, Kanuti National Wildlife Refuge, Gates of the Arctic National Park, and Whitehorse, Yukon&#x27;s wildlife preserve.

There have been at least two domestication endeavours. In the 1950s, an American researcher and adventurer was able to capture muskox calves in Northern Canada for relocation to a property he prepared in Vermont. One condition imposed by the Canadian government was that he was not allowed to kill adults defending their young. When nets and ropes proved useless, he and his crew herded family groups into open water, where calves were successfully separated from the adults. Once airfreighted to Montreal and trucked to Vermont, the young animals habituated to the temperate conditions. Although the calves thrived and grew to adulthood, parasite and disease resistance problems impaired the overall success of the effort. The surviving herd was eventually moved to a farm in Palmer, Alaska, where it has been successful since the mid-1950s.

=== Reintroductions in Eurasia ===
In 1913, workers building a railway over Dovrefjell found two fossil muskox vertebrae. This led to the idea of introducing muskoxen to Norway from Greenland. The first release in the world was made on Gurskøy outside Ålesund in 1925–26. They were muskoxen caught by Norwegian seal-hunting boats in Greenland. The animals colonized the island, but eventually died out there. An attempt to introduce the muskox to Svalbard also failed. Seventeen animals were released in 1929 by Adventfjorden on West Spitsbergen. In 1940, the herd numbered 50, but in the 1970s, the whole herd disappeared. In September 1932, polar researcher Adolf Hoel conducted another experiment, importing 10 muskoxen to Dovrefjell. This herd survived until World War II, when they were hunted and exterminated. In 1947 and later, new animals were released. A small group of muskoxen from Dovrefjell migrated across the national border to Sweden in 1971 and established themselves in Härjedalen, whereby a Swedish herd was established.

The Norwegian population on Dovrefjell is managed over an area of and in the summer of 2012 consisted of approximately 300 animals. Since 1999, the population has mostly been increasing, but it suffered a measles outbreak in the summer of 2004 that killed 29. Some animals are also occasionally killed as a result of train collisions on the Dovre Railway. The population is divided into flocks in the area, area and Hjerkinn. In the summer they move down towards Driva, where there are lush grass pastures.

Although the muskox belongs to the dry Arctic grassland, it seems to do well on Dovrefjell. However, the pastures are marginal, with little grass available in winter (the muskox eats only plants, not lichen as reindeer do), and over time, inbreeding depression is expected in such a small population which originated from only a few introduced animals.

In addition to the population on Dovrefjell, the University of Tromsø had some animals on outside Tromsø until 2018.

Muskoxen were introduced to Svalbard in 1925–26 and 1929, but this population died out in the 1970s. They were also introduced in Iceland around 1930 but did not survive.

In Russia, animals imported from Banks and Nunivak were released in the Taymyr Peninsula in 1974 and 1975, and some from Nunivak were released in Wrangel Island in 1975. Both locations are north of the Arctic Circle. By 2019 the population on Wrangel Island was about 1100, and the Taymyr Peninsula, about 11,000–14,000. A few muskoxen herds migrated from the Taymyr Peninsula far to the south to the Putorana Plateau. Once established, these populations have been, in turn, used as sources for further reintroductions in Siberia between 1996 and 2010. One of the last of these actions was the release of six animals within the Pleistocene Park project area in the Kolyma River in 2010, where a team of Russian scientists led by Sergey Zimov aims to prove that muskoxen, along with other Pleistocene megafauna that survived into the early Holocene in northern Siberia, did not disappear from the region due to climate change, but because of human hunting.

=== Introductions in eastern Canada ===
Ancient muskox remains have never been found in eastern Canada, although the ecological conditions in the northern Labrador Peninsula are suitable for them. In 1967, 14 animals were captured near Eureka on Ellesmere Island by the Institute for Northern Agricultural Research (INAR) and brought to a farm in Old Fort Chimo Kuujjuaq, northern Quebec, for domestication to provide a local cottage industry based on &quot;qiviut&quot;, a fine natural fiber. The animals thrived and the &quot;qiviut&quot; industry showed early success with the training of Inuit knitters and marketing, but it soon became clear that the Quebec government had never intended that the muskoxen be domestic, but had used INAR to capture muskoxen to provide a wild population for hunting. Government officials demanded that INAR leave Quebec and the farm be closed. Subsequently, 54 animals from the farm were released in three places in northern Quebec between 1973 and 1983, and the remaining were ceded to local zoos. Between 1983 and 1986, the released animals increased from 148 to 290, at a rate of 25% per year, and by 2003, an estimated 1,400 muskoxen were in Quebec. Additionally, 112 adults and 25 calves were counted in the nearby Diana Island in 2005, having arrived there by their own means from the mainland. Vagrant adults are sometimes spotted in Labrador, though no herds have been observed in the region.

== Ecology ==
During the summer, muskoxen live in wet areas, such as river valleys, moving to higher elevations in the winter to avoid deep snow. Muskoxen will eat grasses, arctic willows, woody plants, lichens &quot;(above lichens are excluded from the menu)&quot;, and mosses. When food is abundant, they prefer succulent and nutritious grasses in an area. Willows are the most commonly eaten plants in the winter. Muskoxen require a high threshold of fat reserves in order to conceive, which reflects their conservative breeding strategy. Winter ranges typically have shallow snow to reduce the energy costs of digging through snow to reach forage. The primary predators of muskoxen are arctic wolves, which may account for up to half of all mortality for the species. Other occasional predators, likely mainly predators of calves or infirm adults, can include grizzly bears and polar bears and wolverines.

== Physiology ==
Muskox are heterothermic mammals, meaning they have the ability to shut off thermal regulation in some parts of their body, like their lower limbs. Maintaining the lower limbs at a cooler temperature than the rest of their body helps reduce the loss of body heat from their extremities. Muskox display the unique characteristic of having hemoglobin that is three times less temperature sensitive than human hemoglobin. This temperature insensitivity allows the muskox&#x27;s hemoglobin to have a heightened oxygen affinity in an extremely cold environment and continue to diffuse high amounts of oxygen into its cold tissues.

== Social behavior and reproduction ==
Muskoxen live in herds of 12–24 in the winter and 8–20 in the summer when dominant bulls expel other males from the herd. They do not hold territories, but they do mark their trails with preorbital glands. Male and female muskoxen have separate age-based hierarchies, with mature oxen being dominant over juveniles. Dominant oxen tend to get access to the best resources and will displace subordinates from patches of grass during the winter. Muskox bulls assert their dominance in many different ways. One is a &quot;rush and butt&quot;, in which a dominant bull rushes a subordinate from the side with its horns, and will warn the subordinate so it can have a chance to get away. Bulls will also roar, swing their heads, and paw the ground. Dominant bulls sometimes treat subordinate bulls like cows. A dominant bull will tap a subordinate with its foreleg, something they do to cows during mating. Dominant bulls will also mock copulate subordinates and sniff their genitals. A subordinate bull can challenge his status by charging a dominant bull.

The mating (or &quot;rutting&quot;) season of the muskoxen begins in late June or early July. During this time, dominant bulls will fight others out of the herds and establish harems of usually six or seven cows and their offspring. Fighting bulls will first rub their preorbital glands against their legs while bellowing loudly, and then display their horns. The bulls then back up about , lower their heads, and charge into each other, and will keep doing so until one bull gives up. Subordinate and elderly bulls will leave the herds to form bachelor groups or become solitary. However, when danger is present, the outside bulls can return to the herd for protection. Dominant bulls will prevent cows from leaving their harems. During mating, a bull will tap an estrous cow with his foreleg to calm her down and make her more receptive to his advances. The herds reassemble when summer ends.

While the bulls are more aggressive during the rutting season and lead their groups, the females take charge during gestation. Pregnant females are aggressive and decide what distance the herd travels in a day and where they will bed for the night. The herds move more often when cows are lactating, to let them get enough food to nurse their offspring. Cows have an eight- to nine-month gestation period, with calving occurring from April to June. Cows do not calve every year. When winters are severe, cows will not go into estrus and thus not calve the next year. When calving, cows stay in the herd for protection. Muskox are precocial, and calves can keep up with the herd within just a few hours after birth. The calves are welcomed into the herd and nursed for the first two months. After that, a calf then begins eating vegetation and nurses only occasionally. Cows communicate with their calves through braying. The calf&#x27;s bond with its mother weakens after two years.

Muskoxen have a distinctive defensive behavior: when the herd is threatened, the adults will face outward to form a stationary ring or semicircle around the calves. The bulls are usually the front line for defense against predators, with the cows and juveniles gathering close to them. Bulls determine the defensive formation during rutting, while the cows decide the rest of the year.

=== Components of glandular secretions ===

The preorbital gland secretion of muskoxen has a &quot;light, sweetish, ethereal&quot; odor. Analysis of preorbital gland secretion extract showed the presence of cholesterol (which is nonvolatile), benzaldehyde, a series of straight-chain saturated γ-lactones ranging from C8H14O2 to C12H22O2 (with C10H18O2 being most abundant), and probably the monounsaturated γ-lactone C12H20O2. The saturated γ-lactone series has an odor similar to that of the secretion.

The odor of dominant rutting males is described as &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;rank&quot;. It derives from the preputial gland and is distributed over the fur of the abdomen via urine. Analysis of extract of washes of the prepuce revealed the presence of benzoic acid and &quot;p&quot;-cresol, along with a series of straight-chain saturated hydrocarbons from C22H46 to C32H66 (with C24H50 being most abundant).

=== Danger to humans ===
Muskoxen are not known to be aggressive. Fatal attacks are extremely rare, but humans who have come close and behaved aggressively have occasionally been attacked.

On 22 July 1964, a 73-year-old man was killed in a muskox attack in Norway. The animal was later killed by local authorities.

On 13 December 2022, a court services officer with the Alaska State Troopers was killed by a muskox near Nome, Alaska. The officer was trying to scare away a group of muskox near a dog kennel at his home when one of the animals attacked him.

== Conservation status ==
Historically, this species declined because of overhunting, but populations have recovered following enforcement of hunting regulations. Management in the late 1900s was mostly conservative hunting quotas to foster recovery and recolonization from the historic declines. The current world population of muskoxen is estimated at between 80,000 and 125,000, with an estimated 47,000 living on Banks Island.

In Greenland, there are no major threats. However, populations are often small in size and scattered; this makes them vulnerable to local fluctuations in climate. Most populations are within national parks, where they are protected from hunting. Muskoxen occur in four of Greenland&#x27;s protected areas, with indigenous populations in Northeast Greenland National Park and introduced populations in and Kangerlussuaq and . In these areas, muskoxen receive full protection.

Muskoxen are being domesticated for the production of qiviut.

<text>The DLX (pronounced &quot;Deluxe&quot;) is a RISC processor architecture designed by John L. Hennessy and David A. Patterson, the principal designers of the Stanford MIPS and the Berkeley RISC designs (respectively), the two benchmark examples of RISC design (named after the Berkeley design).

The DLX is essentially a cleaned up (and modernized) simplified Stanford MIPS CPU. The DLX has a simple 32-bit load/store architecture, somewhat unlike the modern MIPS architecture CPU. As the DLX was intended primarily for teaching purposes, the DLX design is widely used in university-level computer architecture courses.

There are two known &quot;softcore&quot; hardware implementations: ASPIDA and VAMP. The ASPIDA project resulted in a core with many nice features: it is open source, supports Wishbone, has an asynchronous design, supports multiple ISAs, and is ASIC proven. VAMP is a DLX-variant that was mathematically verified as part of Verisoft project. It was specified with PVS, implemented in Verilog, and runs on a Xilinx FPGA. A full stack from compiler to kernel to TCP/IP was built on it.

==History==
In the Stanford MIPS architecture, one of the methods used to gain performance was to force all instructions to complete in one clock cycle. This forced compilers to insert &quot;no-ops&quot; in cases where the instruction would definitely take longer than one clock cycle. Thus input and output activities (like memory accesses) specifically forced this behaviour, leading to artificial program bloat. In general MIPS programs were forced to have a lot of wasteful NOP instructions, a behaviour that was an unintended consequence. The DLX architecture does not force single clock cycle execution, and is therefore immune to this problem.

In the DLX design a more modern approach to handling long instructions was used: data-forwarding and instruction reordering. In this case the longer instructions are &quot;stalled&quot; in their functional units, and then re-inserted into the instruction stream when they can complete. Externally this design behaviour makes it appear as if execution had occurred linearly.

==Instruction decoding==
DLX instructions can be broken down into three types, &quot;R-type&quot;, &quot;I-type&quot; and &quot;J-type&quot;. R-type instructions are pure &quot;register&quot; instructions, with three register references contained in the 32-bit word. I-type instructions specify two registers, and use 16 bits to hold an &quot;immediate&quot; value. Finally J-type instructions are &quot;jumps&quot;, containing a 26-bit address.

Opcodes are 6 bits long, for a total of 64 possible basic instructions. To select one of 32 registers 5 bits are needed.
* In the case of R-type instructions this means that only 21 bits of the 32-bit word are used, which allows the lower 6 bits to be used as &quot;extended instructions&quot;.
* The DLX can support more than 64 instructions, as long as those instructions work purely on registers. This quirk is useful for things like FPU support.

==Pipeline==
The DLX, like the MIPS design, bases its performance on the use of an instruction pipeline. In the DLX design this is a fairly simple one, &quot;classic&quot; RISC in concept. The pipeline contains five stages:

;IF – Instruction Fetch unit/cycle
: IR&lt;-Mem(PC)
: NPC&lt;-PC+4
: Operation: Send out the PC and fetch the instruction from memory into the Instruction Register (IR); increment the PC by 4 to address the next sequential instruction. The IR is used to hold the next instruction that will be needed on subsequent clock cycles; likewise the register NPC is used to hold the next sequential PC.
;ID – Instruction Decode unit
: Operation: Decode the instruction and access the register file to read the registers. This unit gets instruction from IF, and extracts opcode and operand from that instruction. It also retrieves register values if requested by the operation.
;EX – Execution unit/effective address cycle 
: Operation: The ALU operates on the operands prepared in prior cycle, performing one of the four functions depending on the DLX instruction type. 
: Memory Reference: Register–Register ALU instruction, Register–Immediate ALU instruction
: Branch
;MEM – Memory access unit
: The DLX instructions active in this unit are loads, stores and branches.
: Memory reference: access memory if needed. If instruction is load, data returns from memory and is placed in the LMD (load memory data) register
: Branch
;WB – WriteBack unit
: Typically referred to as &quot;the store unit&quot; in modern terminology. Write the result into the register file, whether it comes from the memory system or from the ALU.

<text>Papa Stour is one of the Shetland Islands in Scotland, with a population of fifteen people, some of whom immigrated after an appeal for residents in the 1970s. Located to the west of mainland Shetland and with an area of 828 hectares (3.2 square miles), Papa Stour is the ninth largest island in Shetland. Erosion of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves, stacks, arches, blowholes, and cliffs. The island and its surrounding seas harbour diverse populations of wildlife. The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around the island are a Special Area of Conservation.

The island has several Neolithic burial chamber sites, as well as the remains of Duke Hakon&#x27;s 13th-century house dating from the Norse occupation of the island. The population reached 380 or more in the 19th century, when a fishing station was opened at Crabbaberry in West Voe. Subsequently, there was a steady decline in population.

Today the main settlement on the island is Biggings, just to the east of which is Housa Voe from where the &quot;Snolda&quot; ferry arrives from its base at West Burrafirth on the Shetland Mainland. Crofting, especially sheep rearing, is the mainstay of island life.

Numerous shipwrecks have occurred around the coast, and the celebrated poem &quot;Da Sang o da Papa Men&quot; by Vagaland recalls the drama of the days when Papa Stour was a centre for deep-sea fishing.

==Geography==

Papa Stour is located at the south western end of St Magnus Bay. of rugged coastline is indented by numerous small embayments and four larger &#x27;s&#x27;. Hamna Voe (Old Norse: &#x27;harbour bay&#x27;) in the south is the most sheltered anchorage and the surrounding cliffs contain a natural rock arch. Housa Voe to the east (Old Norse: &#x27;house bay&#x27;) is less secluded but is the main harbour for the island and the ferry&#x27;s embarkation point.

Brei Holm and Maiden Stack guard the harbour entrance to the south. The former is a tidal island and was a leper colony until the 18th century (although it has been suggested that many of the &quot;lepers&quot; there were suffering from a vitamin deficiency rather than leprosy). The latter&#x27;s name relates to a story from the 14th century. Lord Thorvald Thoresson is said to have constructed the tiny house at its top, whose ruins are still visible, to &quot;preserve&quot; his daughter from men. Unfortunately for his plans, when she left she was found to be pregnant; in another version of the story, she and her fisherman sweetheart successfully eloped. West Voe, the inner part of which is called &#x27;Robies Noust&#x27; is the main voe in the north coast, the smaller Culla Voe lying immediately to the west.

The main settlement on the island today is Biggings, which overlooks Housa Voe and is surrounded by in-bye land to the east of the hill dyke (which runs south from West Voe). To the west the island is bisected by a belt of glacial moraine about in length. Much of the rest of the area consists of a shallow stony soil that may be derived from glacial till. There is an almost complete absence of peat on the island and due to the volcanic rocks the soils are relatively fertile. The lack of peat led to &#x27;turf scalping&#x27; for fuel and the bare areas of rock in the interior.

The highest point on the island is in the north west at Virda Field, which rises to . &quot;Virda&quot; is possibly from the Old Norse for &#x27;heap of stones&#x27;.

===List of outliers===

In addition to the larger islets mentioned above there are various other isles and skerries around the coast of Papa Stour. They include: Aesha Stack, Boinna Skerry, Borse Skerry, Fogla Skerry, Forewick Holm, Galti Stacks, Holm of Melby, Koda Skerry, Lyra Skerry, Skerries of Quidaness, Skerry of Lambaness, Sula Stack, Swat Skerry, The Horn, Tiptans Skerry and Wilma Skerry. The Ve Skerries lie to the north west. They include: Helliogoblo, North Skerry, Ormal, Reaverack and The Clubb. In between Papa Stour and Ve Skerries lies the shallow bank of Papa-rof.

On 21 June 2008, Stuart Hill (AKA Captain Calamity) made a claim to the island of Forewick Holm (which he calls &quot;Forvik Island&quot;). On the basis of a marriage arrangement between King Christian of Norway and King James III of Scotland that dates to 1468, Hill argued that the island should be considered a British crown dependency, and thus not a part of the United Kingdom or of the European Union. This claim was not recognised by the United Kingdom.

==Geology==
The island is composed of a variety of volcanic and sedimentary rock formations from the Devonian period. At that time the Scottish landmass formed part of the Old Red Sandstone Continent and lay some 10–25 degrees south of the equator. The accumulations of Old Red Sandstone, laid down from 408 to 370 million years ago, were created as earlier Silurian rocks, uplifted by the formation of Pangaea, eroded and then were deposited into river deltas. The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of the eroding mountains, stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth. The structure of Papa Stour is largely made up of ashes and lavas from volcanic activity associated with this period, including bands of solidified volcanic ash and lava (rhyolite), but there is also a Devonian fish bed at Lamba Banks. There are numerous large boulders deposited by Pleistocene glaciation.
Erosion of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves, stacks, arches, blowholes, cliffs, voes and geos that are among the finest in Britain. The &#x27;Hol o&#x27; Bordie&#x27; is a cave that passes right through the north-west tip of the island. It is long and wide enough to row through. Kirstan (or Christie&#x27;s) Hole in the south west is another spectacular cave, part of the roof of which collapsed in 1981. Yet another is &#x27;Francie&#x27;s Hole&#x27; close to Hamna Voe in the west. This was the favourite of John Tudor who wrote of the island in his Victorian memoirs and described the cave as:
&quot;...in fairyland, so exquisite is the colouring of the roof and sides and so pellucid is the water... [with] alcoves or recesses like stalls in a church.&quot;

In 1953 the spectacular headland, &#x27;Da Horn o Papa&#x27; fell into the sea during a storm. The nearby islet of Brei Holm also has caves that can be accessed by small boats when conditions permit.

==Ecology==

There is a profusion of wild flowers, including mountain everlasting, spring squill and eyebright as well as the ubiquitous heather. The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around Papa Stour are a Special Area of Conservation. The traditional Shetland Pony is still bred.

Otters, grey seals, killer whales and harbour porpoises are frequently seen on and around Papa Stour. Atlantic puffin, Arctic and common tern, bonxie and Arctic skua, northern fulmar, common guillemot, razorbill, curlew, wheatear, ringed plover and great black-backed gull all breed on the island, and numerous migratory species have been recorded. The northern and western parts of the island have been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International.

==History and archaeology==
Human settlement of the island dates from circa 3000 BC and there are remains of several Neolithic burial chambers known as &#x27;heel-shaped cairns&#x27;. Little is known of the pre-Celtic and Celtic eras, but when the Norse arrived it is likely they found a religious settlement as the name of the island derives from &quot;Papey Stóra&quot; meaning &quot;Big island of the Papar&quot; (Celtic monks), in distinction to Papa Little some to the west.

===Norse period===
Papa Stour is the subject of a 1299 manuscript written in Old Norse, which is the oldest surviving document from Shetland. It deals with a dramatic incident in the house of Duke Hakon Magnusson, who was later to become King Hakon V of Norway. There is a circle of stones near the beach at Housa Voe, which are the remains of a &#x27;ting&#x27;, or local assembly. This was the scene of a duel, fought and won by Lord Thorvald Thoresson, who was accused of corruption in the 1299 document and was later called &#x27;dominus de Papay&#x27;. (The story of his unfortunate daughter is referred to above.) The remains of Duke Hakon&#x27;s 13th-century house are still visible near Housa Voe.

===Scots rule and fishing===

In 1469 Shetland came under nominal Scottish control, although the Norse &#x27;Lairds of Norway&#x27; kept their Papa Stour estates until the 17th century. In the 16th century merchants from Bremen and Hamburg were operating a summer trading booth to buy fish from the local fleet. By the 18th century, two Scottish lairds, Thomas Gifford of Busta, and Arthur Nicolson of Lerwick, owned the island. They maintained a prosperous Haaf (Old Norse: &#x27;deep sea&#x27;) fishing industry, undertaken in the summer months using six-oared boats known as sixareens.

In addition to the leper colony on Brei Holm there may have been another at Hilla Fielle overlooking Hamna Voe. A recent archaeological survey was inconclusive but suggests the site may be much older than the supposed 18th-century colony.

The island church, which overlooks Kirk Sand in the bay of Fore Wick, was founded in 1806. from the present church there may be an older chapel site of Sneeans or Snøyans on the headland between the west end of Kirk Sand and the bay of Tusselby. It is called the &#x27;ald kirk&#x27; by locals and referred to by the Ordnance Survey as &quot;the site of a Romish chapel belonging to about the twelfth century&quot;. There is a tradition that the work there was interfered with by supernatural powers and that each day&#x27;s work on the building was destroyed during the night. Eventually the cornerstones were moved overnight by these unearthly agencies to the present site of the church and work was re-commenced there successfully. Excavations in 2004 found little besides large blocks of rhyolite and a piece of whalebone rib, suggesting that the oral tradition may have some truth to it.

In the 19th century the Crabbaberry fishing station in West Voe was opened and the island had a population of 360 people or more. However, fuel shortages and a decline in fishing due to the introduction of steam drifters saw a fall in population from the 1870s on. At this time another duel entered the history of Papa Stour. Edwin Lindsay, an Indian army officer and the son of the 6th Earl of Balcarres, was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in one. He spent 26 years as a prisoner before the Quaker preacher Catherine Watson arranged for his release in 1835. Lindsay&#x27;s Well is a spring at the south of the island where he was allowed to bathe.

There are good examples of horizontal water mills, also known as Norse or Clack Mills, around Dutch Loch. Originally these were two-storey buildings with turf roofs, built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the millstone was sited. Inside the building there was a fixed lower millstone, and a rotating upper millstone driven by the water falling onto the paddles below. Some were still in use on Papa Stour in the early years of the 20th century, and there is still a working example of one of these mills on the Burn of Clumlie, at Troswick in the south Mainland of Shetland.

===20th and 21st centuries===

In common with many small Scottish islands, Papa Stour&#x27;s population peaked in the 19th century and has experienced a significant decline since then (see e.g. Mingulay). By 1970 the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen &#x27;fairly elderly&#x27; residents, but an advertisement in &quot;Exchange and Mart&quot; reversed the decline. A croft and five sheep were offered free of charge to incomers which brought a flood of applicants. By 1981 the census recorded a population of 33. However, by 2005 the population had fallen to 20 after serious discord between islanders led to several court cases. A number of people left the island and the school closed. By early 2008 the population had dropped to just nine after a family of seven left. The 2011 census recorded a usually resident population of 15 – during the decade 2001–2011 Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.

Overview of population trends


===Shipwrecks===
The coasts around Papa Stour have claimed numerous wrecks. In Hamnavoe, Tiptans Skerry alone has sunk Dutch, French, German and Norwegian ships.

The Aberdeen trawler &quot;Ben Doran&quot; A178, foundered on the Ve Skerries 3 miles northwest of Papa Stour, on the evening of 28 March 1930 while on her way to the village of Scalloway to land her catch. When she grounded weather conditions were fairly good but it was not until the following day that a passing trawler saw, and reported the wreck. By the time that various rescue attempts were launched by the coastguard and local volunteers (there being no lifeboat in Shetland at that time), weather conditions had deteriorated to the point where it was impossible to approach the skerries. A request had been made for the Stromness lifeboat from Orkney, only 120 miles away, to launch, but the request was made too late to be of help. All 9 crew perished in the wreck. Only 3 bodies were recovered, that of James Mitchell, which was returned to Aberdeen, and the bodies of J. Cormack and J.R. Insh, which were buried in Scalloway.

The cargo ship SS &quot;Highcliffe&quot; ran aground in fog on Forewick Holm in February 1940. On this occasion the conditions were clement and only the ship and cargo were lost. In 1967 the Aberdeen trawler &quot;Juniper&quot; ran aground in Lyra Sound at the bottom of the cliffs. The 12-man crew were rescued by the Aith lifeboat, the coxswain being awarded the RNLI silver medal for this rescue.

Another shipwreck occurred on 9 December 1977 when the Aberdeen trawler &quot;Elinor Viking&quot; A278, skipper Alec Flett, foundered on the Ve Skerries. The Aith Lifeboat came to the scene but was unable to get near enough to rescue the crew because of the sea conditions. At the request of Alec Webster, Coastguard Station Officer, Lerwick, a volunteer crew in a British Airways Sikorsky S61N helicopter from Sumburgh Airport was scrambled. They managed to winch all the boat&#x27;s crew to safety within hours of the grounding, despite the storm force winds. The helicopter crew later received a number of awards for bravery. There was no loss of life, but this incident prompted the building of a lighthouse on the skerries in 1979, and may also have been the example required for the formation of the present Search and Rescue helicopter unit, based at Sumburgh Airport.

==Economy and transport==

Crofting is the mainstay of island life. Sheep form the backbone of the agricultural economy but a diversity livestock are kept, including cattle, pigs, goats, chickens, ducks and geese. Vegetable are grown too, often in the shelter of circular walls, such plots being known as &#x27;planti crubs&#x27; – these were originally used to propagate kale (cabbage) seedlings and were built well away from other buildings where they would be safe from mice. The seedlings would then be transplanted to kaleyards (gardens) near the houses. Fishing is still conducted but on a relatively small scale. There is a post office at the pier, but no shop. Mains electricity only came to the island at the close of the 20th century. The Papa Stour Project is a Christian supported housing service offering accommodation to men with drug and alcohol issues. Ferries now sail across the Sound of Papa to West Burrafirth on the Shetland Mainland. The crossing takes 45 minutes, and although the &quot;Snolda&quot; carries cars, there is only one short road on the island. For visiting yachts the four main voes provide good shelter, but the strong tides in both the Sound of Papa and to the north west require considerable care.

===Airstrip===
==Culture and the arts==
The Papa Stour sword dance may be of Norse origin and bears similarities to the long sword dance of the north east of England. A description of the dance appears in &quot;The Pirate&quot; by Sir Walter Scott.

The writer and journalist John Sands lived on Papa Stour and Foula for a while during the late 19th century. The writer, folklorist and musician, George P. S. Peterson was brought up on Papa Stour.

It is also the &#x27;Papa&#x27; of Vagaland&#x27;s poem &quot;Da Sang o da Papa men&quot;, now adopted as part of the folksong tradition, as set to music by T.M.Y. Manson. The insistent chorus chant, &#x27;Rowin Foula Doon!&#x27;, is particularly striking.

:&quot;Oot bewast da Horn o Papa,
:Rowin Foula doon!
:Owir a hidden piece o water,
:Rowin Foula doon!
:Roond da boat da tide-lumps makkin,
:Sunlicht trowe da cloods is brakkin;
:We maan geng whaar fish is takkin,
:Rowin Foula doon!&quot;

&quot;Rowin Foula doon!&quot; refers to the fishermens&#x27; practice of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high cliffs of Foula were no longer visible. This entailed the boat being some west of Papa Stour. The &#x27;tide-lumps&#x27; are increased swells of unusual size due to the combined action of wind against tide. The resonant final image of the piece is of the fishermen being led back home to Papa by the &#x27;scent o flooers&#x27; across the water. This is an example of Vagaland&#x27;s ability to create a vivid sensual impression of a situation. An extra layer of meaning is added by the knowledge that Da Horn o Papa collapsed in a storm around the time of this poem&#x27;s composition, so that it is a tribute not just to a lost way of life, but a noted geographical feature.

<doc id="482315" wikidata="Q3551564" url="?curid=482315" title="Xi'an International Studies University">
<text>Xi&#x27;an International Studies University (XISU; ) is a provincial public linguistics university located in Xi&#x27;an, Shaanxi, China. The university is affiliated with and funded by the Province of Shaanxi.

XISU is one of the universities with well-known foreign language departments and a member of G8 Universities (G8 refers to the Group of Eight Universities of Foreign Languages and International Studies in China, who have the academic specialisation in Foreign Language teaching and International Studies). The university has three campuses, the north Yanta campus (old campus), the South Chang&#x27;an campus (in Xi&#x27;an University City) and Yahe campus, where the university&#x27;s high school is located.

== History ==
Established in 1952 as the Northwest College of Russian and later Xi&#x27;an Foreign Languages Institute, XISU is one of the four oldest foreign language teaching institutions in P. R. China (the other three located in Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing, that was a part of Sichuan). and the only international studies-based university in the northwest region of the country, covering a large geographical area spanning from Shaanxi to Xinjiang. In 1958, it was renamed Xi&#x27;an Foreign Languages Institute, and in 1979, the university initiated graduate programs in Linguistics and Literature. In 1995, it merged Shaanxi Foreign Language School, which is its current Yanta campus and, in 2005, the Chang&#x27;an campus was completed. Approved by the MOE (Ministry of Education), it was renamed Xi&#x27;an International Studies University in 2006.

Currently, XISU offers its 24,000 students 43 undergraduate degree programs, with the humanities as the core of its curriculum while covering other areas such as social sciences, business, law, tourism, international relations, mass communication and education.

* At the graduate level, XISU offers 26 Master of Arts programs, with majors in linguistics, literature, cross-cultural communication, translation studies, business, tourism and teaching Chinese to speakers of other languages. Besides the Ph.D. programs jointly offered with other three institutions in France and Germany, XISU has been approved by the central government to offer its own Ph.D. programs in linguistics and literature and began enrolling students in 2014.

===Development phase===
The university experienced three phases of development in its history. During the first one, from 1952 to 1958, the academy produced many Russian graduates who were the main force in the early construction of new China.

The second one was from 1958 to 2006 when the institution used the name of Xi&#x27;an Foreign Languages Institute. During this period, the institute experienced dramatic progress in its development with the introduction of undergraduate majors in English, German, Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Arabic, Korean, Hindi, and Thai at different times after the Cultural Revolution, and with the Education Ministry&#x27;s approval master&#x27;s degree programs in English, Russian, French, German, and Japanese.

The current and ongoing phase began in 2006 when the Education Ministry upgraded the institute to a university, because of its comprehensive majors and minors, and its academic force. Several generations of people at XISU started from scratch and forged ahead with enterprise, creating a success story of perseverance. XISU is a highly recognized foreign studies university, with a salient focus on Literature, Economics, Management, Law, Education, Science and Art. It is an important base for foreign language education and teacher development, playing an irreplaceable role in the country&#x27;s northwest and enjoying a positive reputation in the world.

== Faculty ==
Now the university has 30 academic schools, colleges, and departments with 41 majors and 7 minors. It has 19 graduate programs of different foreign languages. It is now considered by many to be one of the top five foreign language universities in China.

There are also 25 centers in fields such as foreign languages and literature, foreign language and teaching, human geography, bilingual dictionary compiling and editing.

== Students ==
Presently there are about 24,000 students studying in the university. Its graduates are well recognized in terms of “foreign language competence, interpersonal skills, work adaptability, professionalism and great potentialities”, thus ushering in a good influx of job opportunities. Alumni of XISU work all over the world, mostly in education. Many of them are working at universities in the U.S., England, Japan, Germany, and France. The university has established cooperative programs such as exchange programs with faculty, administrators, and students with most countries.

== International exchange ==
It places stress on international cooperation and exchange, opening up to the global context of education. To date, it maintains close scholarly ties with 157 institutions of higher learning in the world, conducts a Confucius Institute in Kazakhstan and Argentina respectively, delivers dual-campus PhD, MA and BA programs in collaboration with seventy-two overseas universities, and runs several internship bases in the US, Singapore, Thailand, France and the UK.

==Motto==
The current motto of Xi&#x27;an International Studies University is &#x27;爱国 勤奋 博学 创新&#x27;, which translates into &#x27;Patriotism Diligence Education and Innovation&#x27;.

<doc id="482322" wikidata="Q1637268" url="?curid=482322" title="NME Awards">
<text>The NME Awards is an annual music awards show in the United Kingdom, founded by the music magazine &quot;NME&quot; (&quot;New Musical Express&quot;). The first awards show was held in 1953 as the NME Poll Winners Concerts, shortly after the founding of the magazine. Though the accolades given are entirely genuine, the ceremony itself is usually carried out in a humorous and jovial manner, and have included categories in the past like &quot;Villain of the Year&quot; and &quot;Worst Record&quot;. The trophies given to the winners resemble an extended middle finger.

==History==
The awards began as the &quot;NME&quot; Poll Winners Concert and associated awards ceremony in 1953. These continued through until 1972, where concerts were filmed and broadcast on ITV. The Beatles and the Rolling Stones were most commonly featured. Venues included the Royal Albert Hall and the Empire Pool, Wembley. In 2008, a compact disc was given away with a special souvenir box set issue of the &quot;NME&quot; magazine on 27 February 2008, called &quot;NME Awards 2008&quot;.

===Britpop era===
In 1994, the awards were briefly renamed the NME Brat Awards, with the title intended as a parody of the Brit Awards. The initial award ceremonies were supportive of the burgeoning Britpop scene with Blur becoming the first band in the modern era to win more than three awards, coming away with five total. Again in 1996, rival band Oasis won four awards: Best Band, Best Live Band, Best Album (&quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;) and Best Single (&quot;Wonderwall&quot;).

Later in the decade, major winners were the Manic Street Preachers (4 awards in 1999) and Blur (3 awards in 2000).

===Garage rock revival===
In 2002, the awards reflected the &quot;NME&quot;″s support for the &quot;New Rock Revolution&quot; garage rock revival, with the Strokes winning three awards (&quot;Best New Act&quot;, &quot;Best Album&quot; and &quot;Band of the Year&quot;).

After the 2002 awards, an article on Telegraph.co.uk reported that the winners of the &quot;NME&quot; awards &quot;were almost interchangeable&quot; with the winners of the Brit awards and criticised then editor Ben Knowles for what they saw as a hypocritical attack on the commercial nature of the Brit Awards.

In 2003, Nick Jago, the drummer of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club gave a &quot;silent&quot; speech lasting 7 minutes, infavourably compared the show to &quot;The Source&quot; awards, was booed and heckled and had to be physically removed from the stage.

The Libertines won &quot;Best British Band&quot; in both 2004 and 2005, as well as &quot;Best New Band&quot; in 2003. The 2003 award win was notable for Pete Doherty breaking and entering former bandmate Carl Barât&#x27;s house stealing many of his belongings, including his award.

In 2006, Arctic Monkeys won both &quot;Best New Band&quot; and &quot;Best British Band&quot; in the same year and became the third band in the modern era to win three awards (Best New Band, Best British Band, Best Track). In his speech, lead singer Alex Turner alluded to how the awards reflected who received the most coverage by the magazine; &quot;Who else was going to be Best British Band? You don&#x27;t write about something that much and then not tell you that you&#x27;re Best British Band&quot;. Elsewhere that year, whilst collecting an award for his charity work, Bob Geldof called host Russell Brand a &quot;cunt&quot; to which Brand replied &quot;[It&#x27;s] no wonder Bob Geldof is such an expert on famine – he&#x27;s been dining out on &#x27;I Don&#x27;t Like Mondays&#x27; for 30 years.&quot; In the same year, Kaiser Chiefs were nominated for a six categories and won Best Album for &quot;Employment&quot;.

In 2007, Razorlight received a worst album nomination for their self-titled album, which &quot;NME&quot; themselves gave 8/10. This made it the highest rated album to receive a worst album nomination.

The 2008 award nominations were criticised in &quot;The Guardian&quot; for a lack of diversity and not including any female artists. Also in 2008, the ceremony was followed by the &quot;NME&quot; Big Gig at the adjacent O2 Arena, where the Cribs performed with Johnny Marr, followed by Klaxons, Bloc Party, Kaiser Chiefs and Manic Street Preachers, who also performed with Tom Clarke of the Enemy and Cerys Matthews.

In 2009, Oasis were nominated for a record 7 awards, whilst Villain of the Year went to George W. Bush for the sixth year in a row.

In 2013, the Killers were awarded their fourth accolade in the &quot;Best International Band&quot; category.

In 2015, Kasabian were nominated for 9 awards, beating the 2009 Oasis record.

<text>In cryptography, the S-1 block cipher was a block cipher posted in source code form on Usenet on 11 August 1995. Although incorrect security markings immediately indicated a hoax, there were several features of the code which suggested it might be leaked source code for the Skipjack cipher, which was still classified at the time.

However once David Wagner had discovered a severe design flaw, involving the key schedule but not the underlying round function, it was generally accepted as being a hoax—but one with an astonishing amount of work behind it. Bruce Schneier noted that S-1 contained a feature never seen before in the open literature; a G-table that results in key and data dependent rotation of S-boxes to use in a given round. When Skipjack was eventually declassified in 1998, it was indeed found to be totally unlike S-1.

<doc id="482327" wikidata="Q574447" url="?curid=482327" title="Grey-headed chickadee">
<text>The grey-headed chickadee or Siberian tit (Poecile cinctus), formerly &quot;Parus cinctus&quot;, is a passerine bird in the tit family Paridae. It is a widespread resident breeder throughout subarctic Scandinavia and the northern Palearctic, and also into North America in Alaska and the far northwest of Canada. It is a conifer specialist. It is resident, and most birds do not migrate. Curiously (with respect to its name), the bird has no grey on its head, which is black, white, and brown.

It is a fairly large tit, 13.5–14 cm long with a weight of 11–14.3 g. The head is dark brown with white cheeks, the mantle brown, the wing feathers blackish with pale fringes, and the underparts whitish with pale brown flanks.

Ecologists in Folldal, Hedmark, Norway found that the Siberian tits accounted for only 1% of all tit individuals in lichen-dominated pine forest in 2011 as opposed to 64% in 1982. This dramatic reduction is attributed to the interspecies competition with the willow tits and great tits, decreased vegetation due to climate change, and logging of old-growth trees which are preferred over new-growth trees .

==Taxonomy==
The grey-headed chickadee was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1779 in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot; from a specimen collected in Siberia. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Parus cinctus&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The grey-headed chickadee is now one of 15 species placed in the genus &quot;Poecile&quot; that was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1829. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;poikilos&quot; &quot;colourful&quot;. A related word &quot;poikilidos&quot; denoted an unidentified small bird. The specific epithet &quot;cinctus&quot; is Latin for &quot;banded&quot;.

Formerly, the grey-headed chickadee was placed in the genus &quot;Parus&quot; with most other tits, but mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence data and morphology suggest that separating &quot;Poecile&quot; more adequately expresses these birds&#x27; relationships.

Four subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;P. c. lapponicus&quot; (Lundahl, 1848) – Scandinavia to north European Russia
* &quot;P. c. cinctus&quot; (Boddaert, 1783) – northeast European Russia through Siberia to Kamchatka and north central Mongolia
* &quot;P. c. sayanus&quot; Sushkin, 1904 – south Siberia and northwest Mongolia
* &quot;P. c. lathami&quot; (Stephens, 1817) – north and west Alaska and northwest Canada

<doc id="482329" wikidata="Q2261370" url="?curid=482329" title="Monyash">
<text>Monyash (/muhn-ee-ash/ munyash) is a village and civil parish in the Peak District, Derbyshire, England, west of the market town Bakewell. It is centred on a village green above sea level at the head of Lathkill Dale in the limestone area known as the White Peak. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 314. Tourism and farming (milk, beef and lamb) are the predominant activities of the village. The area was once an important meeting place, a watering point for drovers’ animals at the intersection of several trade routes, and industrial centre supporting the local lead mining industry.

==History==
People have been living in and around Monyash since Neolithic times (3750–1750 BC) and probably before then. The nearby impressive stone circle and henge, Arbor Low, was likely built around 2000 BC by people living in the village who also farmed the relatively fertile soils at the head of Lathkill Dale.

The village can attribute its existence, and its name, to water. Lying underneath the centre of the village is a narrow band of clay deposited during the Ice Age. This resulted in pools of standing water, a highly unusual feature in a limestone area. Over time meres (ponds) were fashioned into the clay by the villagers that enabled life before piped water. Only one remains today, called &quot;Fere Mere&quot;, which is situated behind the Primary School.

The Domesday Book of 1086 names the village as &quot;Maneis&quot;, a berewick of Bakewell and owned by the King. The name &quot;Maneis&quot; means &quot;many springs or waters&quot;.

In an Anglo-Saxon tumulus on Benty Grange farm, in the south of the parish, the famous Benty Grange helmet was discovered in 1848.

During the 14th century Monyash prospered from the mining of lead and with the granting of a charter for a weekly market. Indeed, over the next few hundred years Monyash grew into a major lead mining area with its own Barmote Court. Besides farming, other activities included limestone quarrying and marble polishing. As a result of all this activity, by the middle of the 19th century, Monyash was a busy place, with a population of some 500 inhabitants, almost twice what it is today, with a wide range of trades including blacksmiths, cobblers, butchers, wheelwrights, wool merchants, joiners, dressmakers, shoe makers, and five pubs.

The village cross seen in the image of the village green is recorded as medieval dating from the time of Edward III, [1327-1377]. According the Derby HER (see external references).

==Buildings and structures==

St Leonard&#x27;s Church, the parish church, was founded sometime between 1100 and 1192. It has a Norman piscina and sedilia. The building is a patchwork of additions and developments. The major enlargements took place around 1199, 1250, 1348 and 1370, followed by two major restorations in 1886–1888 (by William Butterfield) and 1996–2006. The church also contains a 15th-century font. Today the church is a grade II* listed building of national importance.

John Gratton (1640–1711), who lived in Monyash for 34 years, encouraged the development of the non-conformist movement, and from the late 18th century the village became a Quaker stronghold, often visited by the Radical Quaker statesman, John Bright. Many of the lead mines were in fact operated by the London Lead Company, a Quaker firm. On his death, Gratton left his cottage and some land, the cottage becoming the Friends&#x27; Meeting House, the &#x27;Quaker Chapel&#x27;.

The present Methodist Chapel was built in two parts. The original Primitive Methodist chapel was erected in 1835 and is now the church hall. A new Primitive Methodist Chapel was joined onto it in 1888.

On the village green are the &#x27;King&#x27; and &#x27;Queen&#x27; trees, planted to celebrate the Coronation of King George V and Queen Mary in 1910.

The Pinfold, a pound, is located on the edge of Monyash, on the road towards Flagg. Stray cattle and sheep were rounded up by the Pinder into this small walled enclosure, from which they could be retrieved, after payment of a fee.

Today there is only one remaining pub (the Bull&#x27;s Head), which dates from the late 17th / early 18th century. (During the Cold War, an early warning system was installed in the pub, circa 1981.) There is also a cafe (The Old Smithy Tea Rooms), and there are Public Toilets on the Bakewell side of the village, nearer Lathkill Dale.

The village has a newly refurbished play area which was designed by children from the local school.

==Festivals==
Monyash also participates in the local custom of well dressing.

It has a school, a pub (The Bull&#x27;s Head), a church, a chapel and a Quaker Meeting House.

The prehistoric Stone Circle Arbor Low is also just 2.8 miles from the village.

<doc id="482331" wikidata="Q3801848" url="?curid=482331" title="Iraqi block cipher">
<text>In cryptography, the Iraqi block cipher was a block cipher published in C source code form by anonymous FTP upload around July 1999, and widely distributed on Usenet. It is a five round unbalanced Feistel cipher operating on a 256 bit block with a 160 bit key.

The source code shows that the algorithm operates on blocks of 32 bytes (or 256 bits). That&#x27;s four times larger than DES or 3DES (8 bytes) and twice as big as Twofish or AES (16 bytes).
It also shows that the key size can vary from 160 to 2048 bits.

A detailed analysis of the source code of the algorithm shows that it uses a 256-byte S-Box that is key-dependant (as on Blowfish, it uses a first fixed S table that will generate, with the key, the second S-Box used for encryption/decryption). The algorithm also uses a 16-column x 16-row P-Box, which is also key-dependent and also initialized from a fixed P table. Each round uses one row from P-Box and 16 columns, which means that the algorithm can use up to 16 rounds.

A comment suggests that it is of Iraqi origin. However, like the S-1 block cipher, it is generally regarded as a hoax, although of lesser quality than S-1. Although the comment suggests that it is Iraqi in origin, all comments, variable and function names and printed strings are in English rather than Arabic; the code is fairly inefficient (including some pointless operations), and the cipher&#x27;s security may be flawed (no proof).

Because it has a constant key schedule the cipher is vulnerable to a slide attack. However, it may take 264 chosen texts to create a single slid pair, which would make the attack unfeasible. It also has many fixed points, although that is not necessarily a problem, except possibly for hashing modes. No public attack is currently available. As with S-1, it was David Wagner who first spotted the security flaws.

<text>Whalsay ( or &quot;Hvals-øy&quot;, meaning &#x27;Whale Island&#x27;) is the sixth largest of the Shetland Islands in the north of Scotland.

==Geography==

Whalsay, also known as &quot;The Bonnie Isle&quot;, is a peat-covered island in the Shetland Islands. It is situated east of the Shetland Mainland and has an area of . The main settlement is Symbister, where the fishing fleet is based. The fleet is composed of both pelagic and demersal vessels. Other main settlements include Clate, Isbister, Sandwick, Saltness, Huxter, Challister, Marrister, North Park and furthest north is Skaw.

The island is fertile and fairly densely populated, with crofting taking second place to fishing as the main local industries.

==Transport==
Ferries sail from Symbister to Laxo and Vidlin on the Shetland Mainland. When normal service is in operation two ferries run a tandem service between Symbister and Laxo. Departure times from the two terminals are normally around every 35 minutes according to a timetable, with the crossing taking approximately 30 minutes. The two ferries currently in service are the &quot;Hendra&quot; and the &quot;Linga&quot;. The Vidlin terminal is used when the weather causes the crossing to Laxo to become too rough. The journey between Symbister and Laxo takes around 30 minutes, but can take slightly longer depending on the weather and tides.

The island also has an airstrip, Whalsay Airstrip, at Skaw which is used only for emergencies.

==Recreation==
Skaw is home to the most northerly 18 hole golf course in the UK. There is a club house with adequate parking. Other sporting facilities on the isle are the Whalsay Leisure Centre, a snooker club and Harbison Park artificial sports field.

Sailing dinghies and Shetland model boats are popular, with an annual Whalsay Regatta, usually taking place in the last week of July. In recent times, the popularity of sailing has declined, with the number of participating boats decreasing with each passing year.

Whalsay has an amateur football club, as well as hockey and netball teams. These teams participate in Shetland leagues. Whalsay F.C.&#x27;s home ground is Harbison Park. In 2005, Whalsay F.C. took part in the Highland Amateur Cup, reaching the fourth knockout round. They beat Halkirk FC 2–0 in the 3rd round, but lost to Pentland Utd 2–1 in the 4th.

==Attractions==
Attractions on the island include the Neolithic ruin of Benie Hoose and the settlement of Sudheim where Hugh MacDiarmid lived in the 1930s and early 1940s. Grieve House is now one of Shetland Amenity Trust&#x27;s Böds which offers economic, self-catering accommodation in a traditional building. Scotland&#x27;s great poet Hugh MacDiarmid (Christopher Grieve) lived for nine years in this croft house, where he wrote some of his best work.

==Media and the arts==
Whalsay is the location for the 2011 novel &quot;Dancing with the Ferryman&quot; by Frankie Valente and is the main location of Ann Cleeves&#x27;s novel &quot;Red Bones&quot; (Macmillan, 2009), the third of her Shetland quartet.

== &#x27;Black fish&#x27; scandal ==
In 2012, a number of Whalsay fishermen were fined for a &#x27;cynical and sophisticated&#x27; fishing scam involving the landing of tens of millions of pounds of illegally caught fish.

<text>Beorhtric (meaning &quot;magnificent ruler&quot;; also spelled Brihtric) (died 802) was the King of Wessex from 786 to 802, succeeding Cynewulf. During his rule, however, his wife and father-in-law had most of the power.

== Early life ==
The names of his parents are unknown but the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; claims that he was descended from Cerdic.

In 786, Cynewulf, the King of Wessex, was killed by Cyneheard, brother of the former King Sigeberht. Cyneheard died soon after.

== Reign ==
=== Becoming king ===
Either with the help of his close ally Offa, the King of Mercia, or quickly coming under his influence, Beorhtric became King of Wessex in 786, but he had to still contend the throne with Ecgberht whom Beorhtric and Offa drove to exile.

In 787, Beorhtric held the Synod of Chelsea jointly with Offa, and in 789, he married one of Offa&#x27;s daughters, Eadburh.

Also in 789, it was during Beorhtric&#x27;s reign that the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; recorded the first Viking raids in England. The Vikings landed on the Dorset coast, near the Isle of Portland, where they killed a royal official, Beaduheard, the shire reeve, as he is said to have thought that they were traders.

Land that had traditionally been on the borders of Mercia and Wessex was administered by the Mercian court, as is seen in Charters of Offa, and his son Ecgfrith. West Saxons seem to have used Offa&#x27;s currency: a recent survey of early medieval single coin finds reveals a trail of Offa pennies running from the Upper Thames to Wareham, a site connected with Beorhtric.

After Offa died in 796, Mercian power over England was weakened, and Beorhtric may have exercised more independence during this period. The only two West Saxon coins to have survived from Beorhtric&#x27;s reign were produced at this time, suggesting that he had established a new mint. One of these coins was found in 1854, two miles outside of Andover. Within a few years, Offa&#x27;s successor, Coenwulf, had restored Mercia&#x27;s position. After 799, Beorhtric&#x27;s relationship with the Mercians seems to have been similar to the situation before Offa&#x27;s death.

=== Death ===
In later years, Asser, a scholar at Alfred the Great&#x27;s court, recorded the story that Beorhtric had died from being accidentally poisoned by his wife, Eadburh. She fled to a nunnery in Francia, from which she was later ejected after being found with a man. The provenance of this story is dubious. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that Beorhtric was buried at Wareham in 802, possibly at the church of Lady St. Mary. Beorhtric was succeeded by Ecgberht who was recalled from exile.

<text>Baslow is a village in Derbyshire, England, in the Peak District, situated between Sheffield and Bakewell, just over north of Chatsworth House. It is sited by the River Derwent, which is spanned by a 17th-century bridge, alongside which is a contemporary toll house.

Baslow village is composed of several distinct areas: Bubnell, Bridge End, Over End and Nether End. The village&#x27;s civil parish is called Baslow and Bubnell, which in the 2011 census had a population of 1,178.

==History==
St Anne&#x27;s Church has an Anglo-Saxon coffin lid in the porch entrance, but the oldest part of the current building, the north aisle, dates from about 1200. The tower was constructed in the 13th century but the rest of the church is newer and was the subject of an extensive restoration in the 19th century. A sundial lies in the church grounds, atop the shaft, base and steps of a cross. This may have acted as a market cross in the 17th century. A second cross lies in the graveyard, moved from Bubnell by Doctor Wrench, who erected the nearby Wellington Monument and is buried in the churchyard. This cross may historically have been known as the &quot;Butter Cross&quot;.

Just behind the church is Baslow Bridge, a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument. At the north west end of the bridge is a stone gabled watch hut, manned daily to protect the village from bandits (not a toll booth as is frequently stated). Built in 1608, this is the oldest bridge across the Derwent never to have been destroyed by floods.
The Baslow Grand Hotel Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1896. The course was still appearing on Ordnance Survey maps in the 1930s.

==Geography==
Baslow village is composed of several distinct areas: Bubnell (west of the river), Bridge End (by the river crossings), Over End (north of the main road) and Nether End (adjacent to Chatsworth Park).

Bridge End is the original settlement, clustered around the church and the ancient bridge and ford across the River Derwent.

Nether End, at the eastern end of the village, has several hotels, pubs, restaurants and tea rooms. There is also a caravan site and a pedestrian entrance to Chatsworth Park. Just outside Nether End (and the village itself) are the so-called &quot;Golden Gates&quot;, a set of gates dating from the 1st Duke&#x27;s rebuilding of Chatsworth, which were moved here by Sir Joseph Paxton for William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire, in the 19th century to make a new entrance to the park, following its extension northwards towards Baslow in the 1830s. The gates are now only rarely used, most usually when large public events are held in the park.

Over End is a residential area on the hillside to the north of the village. It contains Baslow Hall, just off Calver Road, which was once occupied by Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti, the radio and electrical pioneer and inventor, and next by George Kenning. Today it is Fischer&#x27;s Restaurant. Near the junction of Bar Road and Gorse Bank Lane was the site of a large Hydropathic hotel, which was demolished in 1936 and is now a small cul-de-sac called Hydro Close.

To the north of the village, Baslow Edge was once quarried for gritstone and features the Eagle Stone, an isolated 6-metre high block of gritstone. According to tradition, the local men had to climb this rock before they were worthy of marriage. Just behind it there is a monument to the Duke of Wellington, raised in 1866 by the local dignitary, Dr Lieutenant Colonel E. M. Wrench. It marked an earlier visit by Wellington to the moor, and was also intended as a balance to the nearby Nelson&#x27;s Monument.

==Sport==
=== Football ===
Baslow Football Club is based on Baslow Sports Field off Church Lane. The club currently competes in the Hope Valley Amateur League and they have a junior section in the Derwent Valley League.

=== Cricket ===
Baslow Cricket Club and ground is also based on Baslow Sports Field. The club has three senior teams: the 1st and 2nd XI Saturday teams compete in the Yorkshire and Derbyshire Cricket League and a Sunday XI team plays friendly matches in and around the region; they also have a junior section that plays in the Notts and Derby Border Youth Cricket League.

==Notable residents==

<doc id="482347" wikidata="Q1333338" url="?curid=482347" title="John Gerard">
<text>John Gerard (also John Gerarde, 1545–1612) was an English herbalist with a large garden in Holborn, now part of London. His 1,484-page illustrated &quot;Herball, or Generall Historie of Plantes&quot;, first published in 1597, became a popular gardening and herbal book in English in the 17th century. Except for some added plants from his own garden and from North America, Gerard&#x27;s &quot;Herbal&quot; is largely a plagiarised English translation of Rembert Dodoens&#x27;s 1554 herbal, itself highly popular in Dutch, Latin, French and other English translations. Gerard&#x27;s &quot;Herball&quot; drawings of plants and the printer&#x27;s woodcuts are mainly derived from Continental European sources, but there is an original title page with a copperplate engraving by William Rogers. Two decades after Gerard&#x27;s death, the book was corrected and expanded to about 1,700 pages.

==Life==
===Early life and education===
Gerard was born at Nantwich, Cheshire, towards the end of 1545, receiving his only schooling at nearby Willaston, about two miles away. Nothing is known of his parentage, but the coat of arms on his &quot;Herball&quot; implies he was a member of the Gerards of Ince. Around the age of 17, in 1562, he became an apprentice to Alexander Mason (died 3 April 1574), a barber-surgeon of the Barber–Surgeon&#x27;s Company (Company of Barbers and Surgeons) in London. Mason had a large surgical practice and had twice held the rank of Warden in the company, and later became Master. Gerard did well there, and was admitted to freedom of the company on 9 December 1569 and permitted to open his own practice. Although he claimed to have learned much about plants from travelling to other parts of the world (see for instance a letter to Lord Burghley in 1588), his actual travels appear to have been limited. For example, at some time in his later youth, he is said to have made one trip abroad, possibly as both a ship&#x27;s surgeon and captain&#x27;s lover on a merchant ship sailing around the North Sea and Baltic, for he refers to both Scandinavia and Russia in his writings.

===Later life, family and death===
Gerard married Anne (or possibly Agnes), who died in 1620, and by her had five children, of whom only one, Elizabeth, survived them. He spent his entire adult life in London, close to Barnards Inn, between Chancery Lane and Fetter Lane. It is thought he resided in a tenement with a garden belonging to Lord Burghley. After his death in February 1612, he was buried at St Andrews, Holborn on 18 February, but the grave is unmarked.

===Career===
Gerard had a successful career with the Barber–Surgeons&#x27; Company. He became a member of the Court of Assistants (board of directors) on 19 June 1595, despite being accused of defaming the wife of a colleague in 1578. He was made an examiner of candidates for admission to the freedom of the company on 15 January 1598 and Junior Warden in August 1597, under the mastership of George Baker. Following a further dispute with a senior warden, he relinquished his positions of &quot;second warden and upper governor&quot; on 26 September 1605, but this was resolved and on 17 August 1607 he was elected Master of the company. In the Annals of the company, published in 1890, a biography of Gerard appears under a list of &quot;Eminent Members&quot;.

While studying he developed the tenement garden in the suburb of Holborn, London, which he refers to frequently in his work, and later published a catalogue of the flowers there. This became popular and he received gifts of seeds and plants from around the world. He also received offers to supervise the gardens of noblemen. In 1577, he began work as superintendent at the gardens of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley (Lord Burghley, the queen&#x27;s Lord High Treasurer) at the Strand and Theobalds, Hertfordshire, a position he continued in for more than 20 years. In 1586, the College of Physicians established a physic garden with Gerard as curator, a position he held till 1604. In 1588, Burghley was Chancellor of the University of Cambridge and Gerard wrote to him commending himself as a suitable superintendent of the university botanic garden, writing &quot;to signe for ye University of Cambridge for planting of gardens&quot;. Amongst his qualifications he wrote &quot;by reason of his travaile into farre countries his great practise and long experience&quot;. There is no evidence for the travel claim and nothing seems to have come of his application. By 1595, when he was appointed to the Court of Assistants, he had built up a reputation as a skilled herbalist and spent much time commuting from the Court to the garden he founded close to his cottage in Holborn, and also attending to his duties for Burghley. In 1596 he requested that the Barber–Surgeons&#x27; Company establish a physic garden (&quot;Mr. Gerrard&#x27;s garden&quot;) in East Smithfield, but this was not done. It was reported that Queen Elizabeth held his achievements in high regard. In October 1603, Gerard was granted a lease on a garden adjoining Somerset House, by Anne of Denmark, the queen consort to King James I, in which he was described as &quot;surgeon and herbarist to the King&quot;. He relinquished the lease to Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury.

According to Anna Pavord, Gerard was a doer and not a scholar. Deborah Harkness notes that Gerard was not part of the community of Lime Street naturalists in London at the time. His flawed (from the perspective of some of his contemporaries) &quot;Herball&quot; is dedicated to Burghley. He surrounded himself with influential friends and contacts, including Lancelot Browne, George Baker, and the apothecaries James Garrett, Hugh Morgan and Richard Garth. Garret was a Huguenot living and working in London, and a neighbour of the Flemish botanist Matthias de l&#x27;Obel (also known as Lobelius). Many of these had fine gardens and would exchange plants. Garth, who described Gerard as &quot;a worshipful gentleman and one that greatly delighteth in strange plants&quot; had South American contacts from where he would import rarities. He also exchanged plants with Clusius and cultivated a certain &quot;Captain Nicholas Cleet of the Turky Company&quot; from whom he obtained specimens from the Middle East. He would also visit other collectors and nurserymen such as Richard Pointer of Twickenham, Master Fowle, keeper of the queen&#x27;s house at St. James and Master Huggens, keeper of the garden at Hampton Court. His servant, William Marshall travelled to the Mediterranean on his behalf and Jean Robin, the French king&#x27;s gardener sent him seeds. After his death in February 1612 he was buried at the parish church of St Andrews, Holborn.

==Work==
===&quot;Catalogue of Plants&quot; 1596===
Gerard&#x27;s 1596 &quot;Catalogue&quot; (&quot;Catalogus arborum, fruticum, ac plantarum tam indigenarum, quam exoticarum, in horto Johannis Gerardi civis et chirurgi Londinensis nascentium&quot;) is a list of 1,039 rare plants he cultivated in his garden at Holborn, where he introduced exotic plants from the New World, including a plant he misidentified as Yucca. The Yucca failed to bloom in his lifetime, but a pip taken from the plant later bloomed for a contemporary. To this day Yucca bears the name Gerard gave it. The list was the first catalogue of this type ever produced. The only known copy is in the Sloane collection at the British Library. L&#x27;Obel wrote an introduction to the text. George Baker describes the garden in his preface to the &quot;Herball&quot; as &quot;all manner of strange trees, herbes, rootes, plants, floures and other such rare things, that it would make a man wonder, how one of his degree, not having the purse of a number, could ever accomplish the same&quot;. A revised edition in 1599 by John Norton, the Queen&#x27;s Printer, placed the English and Latin names in opposite columns.

===&quot;Herball&quot; 1597===
The publisher and Queen&#x27;s Printer John Norton proposed to Gerard an English translation of Dodoens&#x27; popular herbal, &quot;Stirpium historiae pemptades sex&quot; (1583). This was a Latin version of an earlier work in Flemish by Dodoens, his &quot;Cruydeboeck&quot; (Herb Book, 1554). It had been translated into English in 1578 by Henry Lyte as &quot;A Niewe Herball&quot; and proved popular. Gerard was not Norton&#x27;s first choice, the translation having originally been commissioned from Dr Robert Priest, a member of the London College of Physicians, who had meanwhile died. Although Gerard acknowledges Priest&#x27;s role, he implies that he died before starting the work. As curator of the College garden, he would have been familiar with Priest and his work. The completed book appears to include much of Priest&#x27;s work, with his own completion of the text in the form of annotations from his own garden, and for the first time, some North American plants. An example is the first English description of the potato, which he mistakenly believed came from Virginia, not South America (see illustration). He then incorporated some unpublished material from L&#x27;Obel and material from the work of Clusius, which he rearranged to follow more closely L&#x27;Obel&#x27;s scheme of his 1570 &quot;Stirpium adversaria nova&quot;. It is thought to be a disguise for the original source.

In the preface (&quot;To the courteous and well-willing Readers&quot;), Gerard acknowledged Priest&#x27;s efforts, but claimed the work was his own;

&quot;and since that Doctor &quot;Priest&quot;, one of our London Colledge, hath (as I heard) translated the last edition of &quot;Dodonaeus&quot;, which meant to publish the same; but being prevented by death, his translation likewise perished: lastly, my selfe one of the least among many, have presumed to set foorth unto the view of the world, the first fruits of these mine own labours&quot;

This led to Gerard being accused of plagiarism, and even of being a &quot;crook&quot;. The work, published in 1597, was his &quot;Great Herball, or, Generall Historie of Plantes&quot;. This edition reused hundreds of woodblocks from Jacobus Theodorus Tabernaemontanus&#x27; &quot;Kräuterbuch&quot; or &quot;Eicones Plantarum seu stirpium&quot; (Frankfurt, 1590), which themselves had been reused from earlier 16th-century botanical books by Pietro Andrea Mattioli, Rembert Dodoens, Carolus Clusius, and L&#x27;Obel. Gerard&#x27;s lack of scientific training and knowledge led him to frequent inclusion of material that was incorrect, folkloric or mythical, such as the barnacle tree that bore geese (see illustration). Nevertheless, the work, including over 1,000 plants in 167 chapters remained popular, providing in English information about the names, habits and uses (&quot;vertues&quot;) of many plants known and rare. It was seen as the best and most exhaustive work of its kind and a standard reference for some time.

====Publication controversy====
Modern authorities disagree on how much of Gerard&#x27;s &quot;Herball&quot; was original. Garret made a chance visit to the Norton publishing shop, where he discovered the proofs of the &quot;Herball&quot; and alerted the Nortons both to errors he discovered in the proofs and the incorporation of some of L&#x27;Obel&#x27;s material. This is recounted by L&#x27;Obel in his &quot;Stirpium illustrationes&quot; (1655), which accuses Gerard of plagiarism. Although the Norton firm was not concerned about plagiarism, it feared errors in a book that was supposed to be an expert reference guide. It hired L&#x27;Obel as an internationally recognised expert on plants, who as Gerard&#x27;s friend had unwittingly contributed to his book, to proof the translations, fix the mismatched illustrations and right the textual wrongs. When Gerard discovered L&#x27;Obel&#x27;s thankless efforts, he had him dismissed. Although Gerard was an experienced collector and plantsman, he lacked L&#x27;Obel&#x27;s scholarship, as is clear in his dedication to Burghley, where he presents himself as a gardener. Gerard dismissed L&#x27;Obel&#x27;s criticisms as being due to unfamiliarity with English idioms.

Norton decided to proceed with publication despite these difficulties. He decided against using Dodoens&#x27; original illustrations since this would have revealed the actual source of the material, but instead rented woodblocks from Nicolaus Bassaeus in Frankfurt, about 1,800 in all, only 16 being original. However, Gerard was then faced with the difficulty of matching them to the text and frequently mislabelled them.

==Legacy==
After Gerard&#x27;s death in 1612, an enlarged, revised and corrected edition of the &quot;Herball&quot; appeared in 1633 and as a third edition in 1636. These were edited by Thomas Johnson, a London apothecary and botanist, commissioned by the heirs to the estate of John Gerard. Johnson&#x27;s edition contained many corrections and new empirical observations. He added over 800 new species and 700 figures. Through anecdotal comments, Johnson carefully distanced himself from the original. For example, he wrote of the entry on the saffron crocus, &quot;Our author in this chapter was of many minds.&quot; The plant drawings in the 1633 and 1636 editions used hundreds of woodblocks originally made for an edition of Rembert Dodoens&#x27;s original herbal, the basis of Gerard&#x27;s work. These were shipped from Antwerp to London. Johnson&#x27;s revisions are the best-known versions, which most later authors refer to, sometimes called &quot;Gerard emaculatus&quot; (&quot;Gerard freed from blemishes&quot;). Long ascribed this term to John Ray, but it is thought to have been used earlier by John Goodyer and others.

Gerard may be seen as one of the founders of botany in the English language, despite being ill-educated was more interested as a herbalist and barber-surgeon in the medicinal properties of plants than in botanical theory. His botanical shortcomings were ascribed by critics in his own time, including John Ray, who commented that despite the fact that the book was the standard botany text in the 17th century, it was by an ignorant man whose lack of foreign languages meant he could not have translated the work. Because it was a practical and useful book, packed with helpful drawings of plants, and because Gerard had a fluid and lively writing manner, his &quot;Herball&quot; was popular with ordinary literate people in 17th-century England. Although scholars at the time recognised that it was a pirated work with many limitations, there is evidence of the book remaining in practical use as a medicinal herbal even in the early 19th century. Agnes Arber notes how a man born in 1842 recounts that in his childhood there was still a woman who used the &quot;Herball&quot; for treating the ailments of her neighbours.

Despite some shortcomings in Gerard&#x27;s effort, Linnaeus honoured him in the name of the plant species &quot;Gerardia&quot;. Gerard&#x27;s &quot;Herball&quot; references many of the poisonous plants mentioned in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. Additional value has been placed on the &quot;Herball&quot; by students of literature. For example, the herb which produces the deathlike sleep of Juliet or Cymbeline may refer to nightshade, &quot;Mandragora&quot; or &quot;Doronicum&quot;, all listed and described in the &quot;Herball&quot;. The writer Mark Griffiths has claimed that the drawing of a man on the title page of the &quot;Herball&quot; depicts Shakespeare, but other scholars dispute this.

The art of describing the natural world by direct observation divides Renaissance natural historians from their medieval predecessors, who were largely uncritical adherents of ancient texts. The earliest printed works in Renaissance natural history fell into two categories: 1. newly recovered, translated and corrected editions of ancient texts, and 2. herbals based on empirical knowledge of early botanists. Although Francis Bacon advocated inductive thinking based on observation or description (empiricism) as the way to understand and report on the natural world, the early Renaissance printed herbals were slightly modified adaptations of works by their medieval predecessors. These somewhat unscientific early scientists generally contented themselves with listing plants and occasionally other things like animals and minerals and noting their medical uses.

John Gerard worked within the early wave of Renaissance natural historians, who sought to systematise natural history while retaining the works of the ancients. The basis for Gerard&#x27;s &quot;Herball&quot; and those of Dodoens and other herbalists was &quot;De Materia Medica&quot; of Dioscorides, an early Greek writer whose work was seen a definitive text, coupled with works by Gerard&#x27;s contemporaries, the German botanists Leonard Fuchs, after whom &quot;Fuchsia&quot; is named, and L&#x27;Obel after whom &quot;Lobelia&quot; is named. Both Fuchs and L&#x27;Obel were early botanists who worked empirically with plants. They were well educated, as were other members of the &quot;Lime Street community&quot; in the City of London. Gerard and L&#x27;Obel were friends who made occasional field trips together.

The South African native botanical plant genus of &quot;Gerardiina&quot; was named after Gerard in 1897.

<text>Barry Lloyd Vercoe (born 1937) is a New Zealand-born computer scientist and composer. He is best known as the inventor of Csound, a music synthesis language with wide usage among computer music composers. SAOL, the underlying language for the MPEG-4 Structured Audio standard, is also historically derived from Csound.

Born in Wellington, Vercoe received undergraduate degrees in music (1959) and mathematics (1962) from the University of Auckland before emigrating to the United States. While employed as an assistant professor at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music (1965-1967) and as the Contemporary Music Project&#x27;s Seattle/Tacoma composer-in-residence (1967-1968), he earned his A.Mus.D. in composition from the University of Michigan (where he studied with Ross Lee Finney) in 1968. Prior to taking these positions, Vercoe supported his doctoral studies by working as a staff statistician at Michigan; it was in this capacity that first acquired an aptitude for computer programming by learning MAD. In 1965, he married fellow composer and Michigan graduate student Elizabeth Vercoe; they had two children before divorcing in the early 1990s. He married Kathryn Veda Vaughn in 1993. 
During a summer respite from his doctoral studies and a subsequent two-year postdoctoral fellowship at Princeton University under Godfrey Winham, his research in digital audio processing paved the way for the subsequent evolution of digital musical composition. From 1970 to 1971, he served as a visiting lecturer at the Yale School of Music.

In 1971, Vercoe became an assistant professor of humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As one of the epoch&#x27;s few specialists in digital synthesis, he has speculated that he was indirectly recruited by president Jerome Wiesner through colleagues John Harbison and David Epstein because Wiesner harbored musical inclinations (having previously collaborated with Alan Lomax) and sought to establish an electronic music laboratory as an inevitable extension of the institution&#x27;s mandate. After a two-year period in which Vercoe designed a real-time digital synthesizer, Wiesner and Edward Fredkin personally procured a PDP-11 for the fledgling research program from Digital Equipment Corporation in the summer of 1973, enabling him to abandon his previous methodology in favor of a streamlined, software-based approach. Shortly thereafter, the Experimental Music Studio was formed in laboratory space vacated by Amar Bose. Following promotion to associate professor in 1974, he joined the Lab for Computer Science as an associate member in 1977. He became a founding member of the MIT Media Lab upon promotion to full professor in 1984 and continues to this day as professor emeritus of music and media arts. For many years, he directed research in machine listening and digital audio synthesis as head of the Lab&#x27;s Music, Mind, and Machine group and served as associate academic head of its graduate program in media arts and sciences from 2000 until his retirement in 2010. His notable students include Susan Frykberg, Miller Puckette and Paris Smaragdis.

He served as a consultant for the Boston Composers Project bibliography of Boston-area composers and compositions, first edition published in 1983.

As of 2015, he resides in Tauranga, New Zealand, where he co-founded and directs One Education, an offshoot of the One Laptop per Child initiative. He is also an accomplished jazz musician.

<text>Mousa ( &quot;moss island&quot;) is a small island in Shetland, Scotland, uninhabited since the nineteenth century. The island is known for the Broch of Mousa, an Iron Age round tower, and is designated as a Special Protection Area for storm-petrel breeding colonies.

==Geography==
Mousa lies directly on the 60th parallel, 60 degrees north of the equator, 30 degrees south of the North Pole. Itlies a mile off the east coast of Mainland Shetland in the parish of Dunrossness about south of Lerwick. Almost divided in two by inlets, East and West Hams, the island is long and almost in maximum width. Geologically beds of hard sandstone alternate with muddy limestones that weather to produce fertile soil. A quarry provided flagstones for Lerwick.

The Norse tended to consider an island to be something that they could circumnavigate, and this included being able to drag a boat over land. Thus Mousa was considered two islands, namely North Isle and South Isle.

==Flora and fauna==
Mousa&#x27;s fertile soil supports a rich diversity of plants, including sheep&#x27;s-bit and creeping willow in the herb-rich grassland, despite the wind, salt spray and grazing by sheep.

Mousa is known for grey and common seals, black guillemots, Arctic terns and storm-petrels. It holds c. 6,800 breeding pairs of European storm-petrels in total. This represents about 8% of the British population and 2.6% of the world population. The island is designated as both a Special Protection Area (SAC) and a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) by NatureScot, and is run as a reserve by the RSPB. The island has also been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International.
The seas surrounding the island host a population of sandeel that provides a food source for many species of fish, seabirds, seals, whales and dolphins: the area is considered to have the most reliable population of sandeels of all the seas surrounding Shetland. These seas are therefore also protected, forming both a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and a Nature Conservation Marine Protected Area (NCMPA).

==History==

Mousa Broch is the best preserved Iron Age fortification in the British Isles. The 2000-year-old round tower stands above a rocky shoreline, one of a pair of brochs guarding Mousa Sound. They may be part of a chain of brochs in this part of Shetland, visible from each other as beacons. The other of the &quot;pair&quot;, at Burland on the Mainland is far less well preserved. Many brochs were the focus of a settlement, but there has never been a full archaeological investigation to confirm this at Mousa. It was cleared out in 1860 and 1919. Mousa has survived intact to such a height and is thought to never have been much higher than it is today. It escaped stone gathering for nearby stone walls and croft houses (now ruined).

Mousa is mentioned in the Orkneyinga Saga as being used as a place of defence during invasions, as well as a lovers&#x27; hideout.

The entrance passage into Mousa Broch is long, reflecting the enormous thickness of its walls. At its base the broch is 15m in diameter, but the interior is only 6m in diameter. Within the huge thickness of the base of the walls are a range of chambers probably used for storage, while at higher levels passages run between the inner and outer skins of the wall. On the inside a steep flight of steps leads to the top of the wall. Halfway up is a landing which probably gave access to an upper level of the interior of the broch, built on a ledge running around the circumference of the interior.

In July 1558, two Scottish ships from Aberdeen, the &quot;Meikle Swallow&quot; and &quot;Little Swallow&quot;, attacked an English fleet off Shetland. The Scottish sailors took cattle and other goods belonging to Olave Sinclair on Mousa. Sinclair claimed compensation in the Edinburgh courts.

==Transport==
The island is readily accessed using the passenger-only ferry which operates from the Shetland Mainland at Leebitton, Sandwick in summer time.

<doc id="482358" wikidata="Q505649" url="?curid=482358" title="Yakovlev Yak-42">
<text>The Yakovlev Yak-42 (; NATO reporting name: &quot;Clobber&quot;) is a 100/120-seat three-engined mid-range passenger jet developed in the mid 1970s to replace the technically obsolete Tupolev Tu-134. It was the first airliner produced in the Soviet Union to be powered by modern high-bypass turbofan engines.

==Development==
In 1972, the Yakovlev design bureau started work on a short- to medium-range airliner capable of carrying 100–120 passengers. It was intended to be a replacement for the Tupolev Tu-134 jet as well as the Ilyushin Il-18, Antonov An-24 and An-26 turboprop airliners. While the new airliner was required to operate out of relatively small airfields while maintaining good economy, as many Soviet airports had been upgraded to accommodate more advanced aircraft, it did not have to have the same ability to operate from grass strips as Yakovlev&#x27;s smaller Yak-40. The requirement resulted in the largest, heaviest and most powerful aircraft designed by Yakovlev.

Initial design proposals included a straight-wing airliner powered by two Soloviev D-30 turbofans and resembling an enlarged Yak-40, but this was rejected as it was considered uncompetitive compared to Western airliners powered by high bypass ratio turbofans. Yakovlev settled on a design powered by three of the new Lotarev D-36 three-shaft high-bypass turbofans, which were to provide 63.90 kN (14,330 lbf) of thrust. Unlike the Yak-40, the new airliner would have swept wings.

The first of three prototypes, which was fitted with an 11-degree wing and registered &quot;SSSR-1974&quot;, made its maiden flight on 7 March 1975. It was followed by the second prototype, (&quot;SSSR-1975&quot;) with the 23-degree wing and a cabin with 20 rows of windows instead of 17 in the first prototype, and a third prototype (&quot;SSSR-1976&quot;) fitted with improved de-icing gear.

==Design==
The Yak-42 is a low-winged monoplane of all-metal construction, with a design lifespan of 30,000 one-hour flights. It has a pressurised fuselage of circular section, with the cabin designed to carry 120 passengers in six-abreast layout (or 100 passengers for local services with greater space allocated to carry-on luggage and coat stowage). The aircraft is flown by a flight crew of two pilots sitting side by side in a flight deck forward of the cabin. Access is via two airstairs, one in the underside of the rear fuselage, like that of the Yak-40, and one forward of the cabin on the port side. Two holds are located under the cabin, carrying baggage, cargo and mail.
All of the prototypes had main landing gear with two wheels each, with the first serial production aircraft, four main wheels were introduced. The wing layout underwent considerable revision during the design process, with the first prototype being built with a wing sweep of 11 degrees and the second prototype with a sweep of 23 degrees. After evaluation, the greater sweep of the second prototype was chosen for production. Early aircraft had a clean wing leading edge with no control surfaces, and plain trailing edge flaps. This changed in later aircraft, which were fitted with leading edge slats, with the trailing edge flaps slotted.

Two engines were mounted in pods on either side of the rear fuselage, with the third embedded inside the rear fuselage, fed with air via an &quot;S-duct&quot; air inlet. An auxiliary power unit (APU) is also fitted in the rear fuselage. No thrust reversers are fitted. The aircraft has a T-tail, with both the vertical fin and the horizontal surfaces swept.

==Operational history==
The first production aircraft was completed on 28 April 1978, with the first scheduled passenger flight, on the Aeroflot Moscow-Krasnodar route taking place on 22 December 1980. Production was at first slow, with only 10 flown by mid-1981. Initial aircraft were fitted for 120 seats in a three-plus-three arrangement. This was soon changed to a first class section with two-plus-two seating, and a main cabin with 96 seats, giving a total of 104 seats.

In its first year of operation Aeroflot&#x27;s Yak-42s carried about 200,000 passengers, mainly on routes from Moscow, but also on international services from Leningrad to Helsinki and from Donetsk to Prague, with the type being planned to enter wider service throughout the Aeroflot fleet. On 28 June 1982, however, the tailplane detached from an Aeroflot Yak-42 in flight owing to a failure of the actuator screw jack, causing the aircraft to fatally crash near Mazyr. The type was grounded as a result, not returning to service until October 1984.

An export order for seven aircraft was announced in 1982 by Aviogenex of Yugoslavia, but the contract lapsed. The availability of the longer-range Yak-42D variant from 1991 onwards gave rise to a few more export sales, to Bosnia, China, Cuba, and Iran. As of 1 January 1995 a total of 185 Yak-42 had been produced, including 105 Yak-42Ds.

==Variants==
;Yak-42:
Original production version. Max. takeoff weight 54,000 kg (119,050 lb).

As of July 2019, 22 Yak-42s remained in commercial airline service. Operators are Izhavia (8), KrasAvia (10) and Turukhan Airlines (4).

==Accidents and incidents==
As of 15 February 2018, eight fatal accidents and one non-fatal incident have occurred on the Yak-42 with a total of 570 casualties.

;28 June 1982
:Aeroflot Flight 8641, a Yak-42 (CCCP-42529) lost control, entered a dive, broke up in mid-air and crashed near Verbovichi, Naroulia District, Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic following a failure of the horizontal stabilizer jackscrew due to fatigue caused by design flaws, killing all 132 on board. All Yak-42s were grounded until the defect was rectified in October 1984. The accident remains the deadliest involving the Yak-42 as well as the deadliest in Belarus to date.

;September 1986
:An Aeroflot Yak-42 (CCCP-42536) was being used for security forces training when a thunderflash ignited the interior. The aircraft burned out, but there were no casualties.

;14 September 1990
:Aeroflot Flight 8175, a Yak-42 (CCCP-42351), struck trees and crashed short of the runway at Koltsovo Airport, Sverdlovsk, Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic after the pilot intentionally deviated from the approach pattern, killing four of 129 on board.

;31 July 1992
:China General Aviation Flight 7552, a Yak-42D (B-2755), overran the runway on takeoff from Nanjing Dajiaochang Airport, China after failing to lift off, killing 107 (or 108) of 126 on board. The horizontal stabilizer had been trimmed in the landing position.

;20 November 1993
:Avioimpex Flight 110, a Yak-42D (RA-42390) leased from Saravia, struck the side of Mount Trojani (near Ohrid, North Macedonia) due to pilot error, killing all 116 on board. Macedonian investigators blamed the accident on an inoperable VOR beacon and pilot error, while Russia claimed a misunderstanding from ATC because the controller spoke Macedonian while the crew used Russian and English in their transmissions. The accident remains the deadliest in North Macedonia.

;17 December 1997
:Aerosvit Flight 241, a Yak-42 (UR-42334) leased from Lviv Airlines, struck the side of Mount Pente Pigadia in the Pierian Mountains of Greece due to pilot error and confusion in the cockpit, killing all 70 on board.

;25 December 1999
:Cubana de Aviación Flight 310, a Yak-42D (CU-T1285), struck San Luis hill while on approach to Bejuma, Cuba after the pilot radioed that he was descending to as part of the approach following a 40 minute hold, killing all 22 on board.

;26 May 2003
:UM Airlines Flight 4230, a Yak-42D (UR-42352) struck a mountain near Maçka, Trabzon, Turkey in poor visibility due to pilot error, killing all 75 on board. The aircraft was flying 62 Spanish soldiers, members of the ISAF mission operating in Afghanistan, back to Spain.

;7 September 2011
: Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash, a YAK-Service Yak-42D (RA-42434), stalled and crashed shortly after takeoff from Tunoshna Airport, Yaroslavl, Russia due to pilot error; of the 45 on board, only the mechanic survived; 29 members of the KHL hockey team Lokomotiv Yaroslavl were among the dead.

<doc id="482363" wikidata="Q5996977" url="?curid=482363" title="Ilam, Staffordshire">
<text>Ilam () is a village in the Staffordshire Peak District of England, lying on the River Manifold. The population of the civil parish as taken at the 2011 census was 402.

== Ilam village ==
Ilam is best known as the location of the neo-Gothic Ilam Hall, a stately home built in the 1820s, partly demolished in the 1930s. It is now a YHA youth hostel owned by the National Trust. It is set in large parklands that are open to visitors and is a Grade II* listed property, as &quot;Ilam Hall and Gardeners Cottage&quot;.

Many of the cottages are in a style that reminds visitors of a picturesque Swiss village, with chalet-style houses and matching school house. This concept was started in the 1800s by Jesse Watts-Russell, who inherited a fortune on the death of his father, a wealthy soap manufacturer. He built the current Ilam Hall and his family resided there for decades.

Ilam is about 4 miles from Ashbourne at the entrance to the scenic Manifold Valley. Ilam lies close to the popular Dovedale valley.

While most of the buildings in the village are from the past two centuries, Ilam dates from Anglo-Saxon times or earlier.

Recently the village has attracted praise for its commitment to eco- friendly policies. Ilam became the first community in the United Kingdom to phase out incandescent light bulbs, cutting annual carbon emissions by 4 tonnes. The initiative was part of the Ilam Climate Change Project, supported by the Marches Energy Agency.

== Geography ==
Ilam is situated in the Manifold Valley near the southern end where it joins the River Dove. The Dove forms the county boundary between Staffordshire and Derbyshire. Upstream from Ilam is the famous Dovedale walk to Milldale. At the Ilam end, the walk crosses the Dove on a famous line of stepping stones. A wide and picturesque curve of the Manifold provides an ideal setting for Ilam Hall. The Peak District Boundary Walk runs through the village along the same route as the Manifold Trail footpath.

=== River Manifold ===
The River Manifold flows underground from Wetton Mill, and rises again at Ilam in the grounds of the hall. The flooded underground section contains a population of a of the European bullhead fish. At some times of the year, the river bed is completely dry apart from the occasional pool.

== Ilam Hall ==

John Port had the first hall built in 1546. Both William Congreve and Samuel Johnson stayed at the hall when it was owned by the Port family. Congreve wrote his first play, &quot;The Old Bachelor&quot; there and Paradise valley inspired Johnson to write his novel &quot;Rasselas&quot;.

In 1820 the estate was bought by Jesse Watts-Russell, a wealthy industrialist. It was Watts-Russell who was responsible for the Swiss look of Ilam; he found that the valley and surrounding hills reminded him of the Alps, and consequently had some new cottages built in the Swiss style and rehoused most of the villagers (who were living in estate-owned houses anyway). He also built the school in 1857 and funded it, at a time when schooling was not compulsory.

His son, John Watts-Russell, moved to New Zealand in 1850 and built another Ilam Hall. The farm/homestead that he created later grew and became the Ilam area of Christchurch. The site of the homestead was one of the main social centres of early Christchurch society. The present homestead was built in 1914 after a fire destroyed the first two buildings.

The Conservative politician Robert William Hanbury (1845–1903), lived and was buried there.

In 1934 Sir Robert McDougal bought the hall and gave it to the National Trust to become a youth hostel and it is still run as such today. The grounds are open to the public, and are a starting point for one of the prettiest river walks in the area.

== Church of the Holy Cross ==
Originally Anglo-Saxon, the church is now mainly 17th and 19th century following restoration in those two centuries.

Some of its origins can be seen in its carved stone Anglo-Saxon font, and in two stone cross shafts in the churchyard. Arthur Mee records that the church was restored in the 19th century by Sir Gilbert Scott, with three chapels, but &quot;still has the 13th century base of its tower, and a wall of the same age. Its most ancient jewel is the wonderful font, so old that it is Saxon or Norman, the round bowl carved with humans and dragons.&quot; This font is thought depict a scene from the legend of Saint Beorhthelm of Stafford.

It is in the Chapel of St Bertram, built in 1618 by the Meverell, Port and Hurt families, that the remains and shrine of the St Bertram (or Bertelin) can be found. St Bertram was an 8th-century son of a Mercian king who renounced his royal heritage for prayer and meditation after his wife and child were killed by wolves. He is said to have converted many to Christianity, and his shrine became a point of pilgrimage in the Middle Ages, it being reputed to be able to work miraculous cures. The chapel contains the Meverell Monument of two reclining figures, above is a memorial for their daughter.

In the David Pike Watts Memorial Chapel, built in 1831, is a large sculpture by Sir Francis Chantrey. The Memorial Window to Josephine Dora Granville is by Ward and Hughes (1884), depicting the presentation of Jesus in the Temple.

Wingfield Cromwell, 2nd Earl of Ardglass (1624 – 1668) is buried there.

== Dovedale House ==
The former vicarage, Dovedale House, is now run as a residential Youth centre. Owned by the Church of England, it is under the management of the Diocese of Lichfield. It is a large old house near the entrance of Ilam Hall. It was opened as a residential centre in 1967.

== Village cross ==

A conspicuous landmark is the Grade II* listed Mary Watts-Russell Memorial Cross; Mary was the wife of Jesse Watts-Russell. Standing as a roundabout at the road junction where a lane branches off towards Blore, this is an ornate gothic-style obelisk of local limestone in the style of an Eleanor Cross. Standing on a three-step plinth, it has two tiers of statues surmounted by a spire with a cross at the top. In style, it bears some resemblance to the decorated facade of Lichfield Cathedral.

A restoration was completed in 2011.

== Manifold Valley Agricultural Show ==

The Manifold Valley Agricultural Show has for a number of years been held within the parish. This show has usually been held on the second Saturday of August. The wide range of categories and activities provides a valuable social focus for this largely agricultural area. The venue is farmland owned by and above Casterne Hall just under a mile north of the village, on the plateau about halfway towards Stanshope. The road continues towards Wetton and Alstonefield.
