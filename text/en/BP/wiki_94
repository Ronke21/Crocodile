<text>The Renown class consisted of two battlecruisers built during the First World War for the Royal Navy. They were originally laid down as improved versions of the s, but their construction was suspended on the outbreak of war on the grounds they would not be ready in a timely manner. Admiral Lord Fisher, upon becoming First Sea Lord, gained approval to restart their construction as battlecruisers that could be built and enter service quickly. The Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Eustace Tennyson-D&#x27;Eyncourt, quickly produced an entirely new design to meet Admiral Lord Fisher&#x27;s requirements and the builders agreed to deliver the ships in 15 months. They did not quite meet that ambitious goal, but they were delivered a few months after the Battle of Jutland in 1916. They were the world&#x27;s fastest capital ships upon their commissioning.

 was the only ship of her class to see combat in the First World War when she participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1917. Both ships were reconstructed twice between the wars; the 1920s reconstruction increased their armour protection and made lesser improvements, while the 1930s reconstruction was much more thorough, especially for . &quot;Repulse&quot; accompanied the battlecruiser during the Special Service Squadron&#x27;s round-the-world cruise in 1923–1924 and protected British interests during the Spanish Civil War between 1936 and 1939. &quot;Renown&quot; frequently conveyed royalty on their foreign tours and served as flagship of the Battlecruiser Squadron when &quot;Hood&quot; was refitting.

Both ships served during the Second World War; they searched for the in 1939, participated in the Norwegian Campaign of April–June 1940 and searched for the in 1941. &quot;Repulse&quot; was sunk on 10 December 1941 in the South China Sea off Kuantan, Pahang by Japanese aircraft. &quot;Renown&quot; spent much of 1940 and 1941 assigned to Force H at Gibraltar, escorting convoys and she fought in the inconclusive Battle of Cape Spartivento. She was briefly assigned to the Home Fleet and provided cover to several Arctic convoys in early 1942. The ship was transferred back to Force H for Operation Torch and spent much of 1943 refitting or transporting Winston Churchill and his staff to and from various conferences with various Allied leaders. In early 1944 &quot;Renown&quot; was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean where she supported numerous attacks on Japanese-occupied facilities in Indonesia and various island groups in the Indian Ocean. The ship returned to the Home Fleet in early 1945 and was refitted before being placed in after the end of the war. &quot;Renown&quot; was sold for scrap in 1948.

==Genesis==

===Improved &quot;Revenge&quot;-class battleships===
The battleships of the 1914 Naval Programme consisted of three improved &quot;Revenge&quot;-class ships, named &quot;Renown&quot;, &quot;Repulse&quot; and &quot;Resistance&quot;, and one further member of the , called &quot;Agincourt&quot;. &quot;Resistance&quot; and &quot;Agincourt&quot; were to be built in royal dockyards while &quot;Renown&quot; was awarded to Fairfield and &quot;Repulse&quot; to Palmers. The design was approved on 13 May 1914 and the improvements over the &quot;Revenge&quot; class consisted of:
* A consistent thickness of for the protective wing bulkheads.
* An enlarged torpedo control tower.
* An enlarged conning tower with the armour rearranged for better access.
* A protected spotting position in the bow.
* The width of the keel was increased to provide a more rigid structure amidships to resist stress while docking.
* Shell stowage for the main guns was increased from 80 rounds per gun to 100.

These changes would have done little to change the size of the ships in comparison to their predecessors other than a decrease in draught to , less than the older ships. They would, however, have been slower than the &quot;Revenge&quot;-class ships as they were to be provided with only rather than the of their predecessors.

Work on all four ships was suspended at the beginning of the First World War and the two ships to be built in the royal dockyards were cancelled on 26 August 1914, as it was believed that they could not be completed before the end of the war. Admiral Lord Fisher, once he returned to office as First Sea Lord in October, began pressuring Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, to allow him to convert the suspended contracts for &quot;Renown&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; into a new class of battlecruisers capable of the very high speed of . Churchill argued that their construction would interfere with other construction programmes, absorb too many resources, and still could not be finished in time. Fisher countered by arguing he could keep the building time to a minimum, as he had done with , by using as much material ordered for the battleships as possible, including their gun turrets. Churchill was unmoved, however, until the experiences of Battle of Heligoland Bight in August and the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December, seemed to demonstrate that high speed and heavy gun power was a potent combination and vindicated Fisher&#x27;s long-held belief on the viability of the battlecruiser. These actions, plus pressure from Admiral Jellicoe, commander of the Grand Fleet, and Vice Admiral Beatty, commander of the Battlecruiser Force, caused Churchill to gain approval from the Cabinet to build two ships on 28 December.

===Battlecruisers===
Admiral Lord Fisher first presented his requirements for the new ships to the DNC on 18 December, before they had even been approved. He wanted a long, high, flared bow, like that on the pre-dreadnought , but higher, four 15-inch guns in two twin turrets, an anti-torpedo boat armament of twenty guns mounted high up and protected by gun shields only, speed of 32 knots using oil fuel, and armour on the scale of the battlecruiser . Within a few days, however, Fisher increased the number of guns to six and added two torpedo tubes. Minor revisions in the initial estimate were made until 26 December, and a preliminary design was completed on 30 December.

During the following week the DNC&#x27;s department examined the material delivered for the two battleships and decided what could be used in the new design and the contract for &quot;Repulse&quot; was transferred from Palmers to John Brown &amp; Company because the former lacked a slipway long enough to use for the new ship. The usable material was transferred to John Brown and both builders had received enough information from the DNC&#x27;s department to lay the keels of both ships on 25 January 1915, well before the altered contracts were completed on 10 March

==Description==

===General characteristics===
The &quot;Renown&quot;-class ships had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. They displaced at standard load and at deep load. While longer than their predecessor, , they displaced less than the older ship at deep load.

The ships proved to be good sea boats, but had to be reinforced while under construction with additional stiffening and pillars under the forecastle deck to cure some minor structural problems forward. They had a metacentric height of at deep load as built as well as a complete double bottom.

===Propulsion===
The original plan for these ships was to use lightweight machinery producing a total of , but that would have required a considerable amount of time to complete its design. Rather than risk delaying the completion of the ships the machinery from HMS &quot;Tiger&quot; was duplicated with the addition of three extra boilers to provide the required power needed for the additional speed. Each ship had two paired sets of Brown-Curtis direct-drive steam turbines, housed in separate engine-rooms. Each set comprised high-pressure ahead and astern turbines driving an outboard shaft and low-pressure ahead and astern turbines, housed in the same casing, driving an inner shaft. Their three-bladed propellers were in diameter. The turbines were powered by 42 Babcock &amp; Wilcox water-tube boilers in six boiler rooms at a working pressure of . They were designed to produce a total of , but achieved more than during &quot;Renown&quot;″s trials, when she reached a speed of . They were the fastest capital ships in existence until the arrival of in 1920.

They were designed to normally carry of fuel oil, but had a maximum capacity of . At full capacity, the &quot;Renown&quot;-class ships could steam at a speed of for . The ships had two reciprocating steam-driven dynamos, one oil-driven dynamo, and one turbine-driven dynamo that supplied the common ring main at 220 volts.

===Armament===

The &quot;Renown&quot;-class ships mounted six 42-calibre BL 15-inch Mk I guns in three twin hydraulically powered gun turrets, designated &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;Y&quot; from front to rear. The guns could be depressed to −3° and elevated to 20°; they could be loaded at any angle up to 20°, although loading at high angles tended to slow the gun&#x27;s return to battery (firing position). The ships carried 120 shells per gun. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; this provided a maximum range of with armour-piercing shells.

The ships were designed with seventeen 45-calibre BL 4-inch Mark IX guns, fitted in five triple and two single mounts. These were manually powered and quite cumbersome in use as they required a crew of thirty-two men to load and train the triple gun mounts. The gun&#x27;s rate of fire was only 10 to 12 rounds per minute as the loaders kept getting in each other&#x27;s way. They had a maximum depression of −10° and a maximum elevation of 30°. They fired a high-explosive shell at a muzzle velocity of . At maximum elevation the guns had a maximum range of . The ships carried 200 rounds for each gun.

Each ship mounted a pair of QF 3 inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns on single high-angle mountings. These were mounted on the shelter deck abreast the rear funnel. The gun had a maximum depression of 10° and a maximum elevation of 90°. It fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of fire of 12–14 rounds per minute. They had a maximum effective ceiling of . Both ships carried ten torpedoes and mounted two  submerged torpedo tubes fitted just forward of &quot;A&quot; barbette.
===Fire control===

The main guns of the &quot;Renown&quot;-class ships could be controlled from either of the two fire-control directors. The primary director was mounted above the conning tower in an armoured hood and the other was in the fore-top on the foremast. Data from a rangefinder in the armoured hood was input into a Mk IV* Dreyer Fire Control Table located in the Transmitting Station (TS) where it was converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns. The target&#x27;s data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. The secondary armament was controlled by directors mounted on platforms on each mast. Each turret was provided with a rangefinder in an armoured housing on the turret roof.

During the war the number and size of rangefinders increased. By 1918 &quot;Renown&quot; carried two rangefinders, one on &quot;Y&quot; turret and the other in the armoured hood above the conning tower. Fifteen-foot rangefinders were mounted on &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; turrets, the torpedo control tower abaft the mainmast, and the armoured hood. The fore-top was equipped with a rangefinder and the anti-aircraft guns were controlled by a simple rangefinder mounted on the aft superstructure. Two rangefinders were mounted on the bridge.

===Armour===
The armour protection of the &quot;Renown&quot;-class ships was similar to that of &quot;Indefatigable&quot;; her waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour measured thick amidships. It ran from the midpoint of &quot;A&quot; barbette to the midpoint of &quot;Y&quot; barbette, a length of , and was high. Strakes of three-inch armour aft and four-inch armour forward continued the belt towards the ends of the ship, although neither reached the bow or the stern. The strakes were enclosed by transverse bulkheads of the same thickness. For much of the length of the main belt there was an upper belt of high-tensile steel, thick, intended as splinter protection.

The gun turrets were thick on the face and front sides, thick on the rear side plates while their roofs were thick. The barbettes were protected by of armour above the upper deck, but it thinned to below the deck. The conning tower sides were thick and it had a three-inch roof. The walls of the communication tube were three inches thick. The torpedo control tower had 3-inch walls and a 1.5-inch cast steel roof.

As designed the high-tensile-steel decks ranged from in thickness. After the Battle of Jutland in 1916, while the ships were still completing, an extra inch of high-tensile steel was added on the main deck over the magazines. Despite these additions, the ships were still felt to be too vulnerable to plunging fire and each ship was refitted in Rosyth in 1916–1917 with additional horizontal armour, weighing approximately , added to the decks over the magazines and over the steering mechanism.

The &quot;Renown&quot;-class ships were fitted with a shallow anti-torpedo bulge integral to the hull which was intended to explode the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and vent the underwater explosion to the surface rather than into the ship. However, later testing proved that it was not deep enough to accomplish its task as it lacked the layers of empty and full compartments that were necessary to absorb the force of the explosion.

==Service==

===First World War===
Both ships spent much of the remainder of 1916 and early 1917 in the hands of dockyards having their armour upgraded and conducting routine patrols of the North Sea. They were assigned to the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron (BCS) for the duration of the war. &quot;Repulse&quot; relieved as flagship of the 1st BCS.

====Second Battle of Heligoland Bight====

Over the course of 1917 the Admiralty became more concerned about German efforts in the North Sea to sweep paths through the British-laid minefields intended to restrict the actions of the High Seas Fleet and German submarines. A preliminary raid on German minesweeping forces on 31 October by light forces destroyed ten small ships and the Admiralty decided on a larger operation to destroy the minesweepers and their escorting light cruisers. Based on intelligence reports the Admiralty decided on 17 November 1917 to allocate two light cruiser squadrons, the 1st Cruiser Squadron covered by the reinforced 1st BCS (less &quot;Renown&quot;) and, more distantly, the battleships of the 1st Battle Squadron to the operation.
The German ships, four light cruisers of II Scouting Force, eight destroyers, three divisions of minesweepers, eight &quot;sperrbrecher&quot;s (cork-filled trawlers, used to detonate mines without sinking) and two trawlers to mark the swept route, were spotted at 7:30 a.m., silhouetted by the rising sun. The light battlecruiser and the light cruiser opened fire with their forward guns seven minutes later. The Germans responded by laying an effective smoke screen. The British continued in pursuit, but lost track of most of the smaller ships in the smoke and concentrated fire on the light cruisers as opportunity permitted. &quot;Repulse&quot; was detached not long after and raced forward at full speed to engage the enemy ships. She opened fire at about 9:00, scoring a single hit on the light cruiser during the battle. When the German battleships and were spotted about 9:50 the British broke off their pursuit and &quot;Repulse&quot; covered their retreat, aided by a heavy fog that came down around 10:40.

In September 1917 &quot;Repulse&quot; became the first capital ship to be fitted with aircraft flying-off platforms on her turrets. A Sopwith Pup successfully took off from the platform mounted on &quot;B&quot; turret on 1 October and repeated his achievement on 9 October from &quot;Y&quot; turret. &quot;Renown&quot; received her platforms in early 1918.

On 12 December 1917 &quot;Renown&quot; put to sea with other elements of the fleet in an unsuccessful attempt to intercept the German 3rd Half-Flotilla of destroyers that had destroyed the Scandinavian convoy and most of its escorts. For the rest of the war the two ships patrolled the North Sea uneventfully. Both ships were present at the surrender of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918.

===Inter-war service===

&quot;Repulse&quot; began a major refit at Portsmouth on 17 December 1918 intended to drastically improve her armour protection. Her existing 6-inch armour belt was replaced by armour plates made surplus by the conversion of the battleship (originally ordered by Chile and purchased after the war began) to the aircraft carrier . The old armour was fitted between the main and upper decks, above the new armour belt. Additional high-tensile plating was added to the decks over the magazines. The ship&#x27;s anti-torpedo bulge was deepened and reworked along the lines of that installed on the battleship . The bulge covered her hull from the submerged torpedo room to &quot;Y&quot; magazine and the inner compartments of which were filled with crushing tubes. The bulges added to her beam and to her draught. The refit added about to her displacement and raised her metacentric height to at deep load. Three 30-foot rangefinders were also added as well as eight torpedo tubes in twin mounts on the upper deck. Both flying-off platforms were removed.

When the Grand Fleet was disbanded in April 1919 &quot;Renown&quot; was assigned to the Battlecruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet. In June she was refitted in preparation for a tour of Canada, Newfoundland and the United States by Edward, the Prince of Wales, and both flying-off platforms were removed. From January to March 1920 &quot;Renown&quot; was refitted more extensively as a &quot;royal yacht&quot;. Her aft 4-inch mounting and both 3-inch AA guns were removed so that extra accommodation and a promenade deck could be built. A large deckhouse was built on the shelter deck between the funnels. The port side housed a squash court while the starboard side was a cinema. The ship sailed in March for Australia and New Zealand with the Prince of Wales and his entourage aboard and made many stops en route. She returned to Portsmouth in October and was placed in reserve in November.

&quot;Renown&quot; was recommissioned in September 1921 for a tour of India and Japan by the Prince of Wales and sailed from Portsmouth in October. The ship arrived back in Portsmouth in June 1922 and she was placed in reserve the following month. The ship began a reconstruction that same month along the lines of her sister, although changes were made based on the experiences with &quot;Repulse&quot;. &quot;Renown&quot;″s main armour belt was removed and a new 9-inch belt was installed, using up the remaining plates left over from &quot;Almirante Cochrane&quot; as well as new armour, but installed about higher than on &quot;Repulse&quot; to offset any increase in draught. A strake of tapered armour was fitted underneath the main belt to deflect any shell that dived beneath the water&#x27;s surface; it was 9-inches thick at top and thinned to at the bottom. The ship&#x27;s deck armour was heavily reinforced adjacent to its machinery spaces and magazines. Two longitudinal bulkheads were added between the upper and main decks that ran from the base of the conning tower to the end of the boiler rooms. The bulges were reworked and based on those used in the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class battleships, although crushing tubes were only used abreast the magazines. The rear triple 4-inch gun mount was replaced. The flying-off platform on &quot;B&quot; turret was reinstated and a high-angle control position (HACP) was added to the fore-top. The pair of 3-inch AA guns and her two single four-inch gun mounts were removed and replaced with four QF four-inch Mark V anti-aircraft guns. They had a maximum depression of -5° and a maximum elevation of 80°. They fired a high explosive shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of ten to fifteen rounds per minute. The guns had a maximum ceiling of , but an effective range of much less. The reconstruction only added to the ship&#x27;s displacement and three inches to her draught.
&quot;Repulse&quot; was recommissioned on 1 January 1921 and joined the Battlecruiser Squadron. In November 1923, &quot;Hood&quot;, accompanied by &quot;Repulse&quot; and a number of s of the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron, set out on a world cruise from west to east via the Panama Canal. They returned home ten months later in September 1924.
 Shortly after her return the ship&#x27;s pair of 3-inch AA guns and her two single four-inch gun mounts were removed and replaced with four QF four-inch Mark V AA guns. The Battlecruiser Squadron visited Lisbon in February 1925 to participate in the Vasco da Gama celebrations before continuing on the Mediterranean for exercises. A squash court was added on the starboard side between the funnels for the Prince of Wales&#x27; tour of Africa and South America that lasted from March to October. Upon her return she was refitted from November 1925 to July 1926 and had a HACP added to her fore-top.

&quot;Renown&quot; finished her reconstruction in September 1926 and she was assigned to the Battlecruiser Squadron until the ship was detached to convey Prince Albert of York to Australia between January and July 1927. Upon her return she rejoined the Atlantic Fleet. &quot;Renown&quot; became the flagship of the BCS when &quot;Hood&quot; was refitting between 1929 and 1931. &quot;Hood&quot; reassumed the role as flagship after she was recommissioned and &quot;Renown&quot; was paid off for a refit of her own. A High-Angle Control System Mark I was fitted with a director on the roof of the fore-top that replaced the high-angle rangefinder and the conning tower platform was enlarged to accommodate a pair of Mk V octuple mountings for the QF 2-pounder Mk VIII gun The Mk V mounts could depress to −10° and elevate to a maximum of 80°. The Mark VIII 2-pounder gun fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a distance of . The gun&#x27;s rate of fire was approximately 96–98 rounds per minute. Only one mount was initially available, however, and it, along with its director, was fitted on the starboard side. &quot;Renown&quot; had her midships triple 4-inch mount removed to make room for an aircraft catapult that was not fitted until 1933. The port Mark V 2-pounder mount was finally fitted, albeit without its director, that same year. The ship now carried a Fairey III floatplane for reconnaissance purposes. The flying-off platform was also removed.

====1930s reconstructions====
After &quot;Repulse&quot; completed her 1926 refit she remained in commission, aside from a brief refit in July–September 1927, with the BCS of the Atlantic Fleet until she was paid off in June 1932 prior to beginning her reconstruction in April 1933. Most of the existing layers of high-tensile steel that constituted the ship&#x27;s horizontal armour were replaced by non-cemented armour plates in thickness and the torpedo control tower was removed from the aft superstructure. A fixed catapult replaced the midships 4-inch triple mount and a hangar was built on each side of the rear funnel to house two of the ship&#x27;s Fairey III aircraft. One additional aircraft could be carried on the deck and another on the catapult itself. Electric cranes were mounted above each hangar to handle the aircraft. The four 4-inch AA guns were moved, one pair abreast the rear funnel at the level of the hangar roof and the other pair abreast the fore funnel on the forecastle deck. Four prototype QF 4-inch Mark XV dual-purpose guns were added in twin-gun Mark XVIII mounts abreast the mainmast. Two octuple Mark VI 2-pounder mounts were fitted on extensions of the conning-tower platform abreast the fore funnel. Above these a pair of quadruple Mark II* mountings for the 0.5-inch Vickers Mark III machine gun were added. These mounts could depress to −10° and elevate to a maximum of 70°. The machine guns fired a bullet at a muzzle velocity of . This gave the gun a maximum range of about , although its effective range was only &quot;Repulse&quot; received two HACS directors, one Mark II on the fore-top and a Mark I* mounted on a pedestal above the rear superstructure. The two submerged torpedo tubes were removed and the vacant spaces sub-divided and turned into store-rooms.

&quot;Renown&quot; began her own even more thorough reconstruction in September 1936, based on that of the battleship . Her superstructure and funnels were razed to the level of the upper deck, her masts taken out and the ship&#x27;s main and secondary armament was removed. A large splinter-proof tower superstructure was built, topped with a director-control tower for the main armament and two HACS Mark IV directors. The armoured hood formerly mounted above the conning tower was reinstalled on the rear superstructure. The ship&#x27;s engines and boilers were replaced by Parsons geared turbine sets and eight Admiralty three-drum boilers. This saved some of weight and allowed the two forward boiler rooms to be converted to magazines and other uses. &quot;Renown&quot;″s deck protection was somewhat upgraded by adding non-cemented armour where it had not been added earlier and protecting the new 4.5-inch magazines. As in &quot;Repulse&quot; hangars were built abreast her rear funnel and a catapult was fitted between the rear funnel and the aft superstructure.

The ship&#x27;s 15-inch gun turrets were modified to the Mark I (N) standard with their elevation increased to 30°. Twenty dual-purpose QF 4.5-inch Mark III guns in twin BD Mark II mountings replaced all of the 4-inch guns. Six of the gun turrets, three on each side, were abreast the forward funnel while the remaining four were mounted on abreast the main mast. The BD Mark II mounts had elevation limits of −5° to +80°. The Mark III gun fired a high explosive shell at a muzzle velocity of about . Its rate of fire was 12 rounds per minute. They had a maximum effective ceiling of . The guns were controlled by four dual-purpose Mark IV directors, two mounted on the rear of the bridge structure and the remaining two on the aft superstructure. They fed tracking data to a HACS Mark IV analog computer for high-angle targets and an Admiralty Fire Control Clock Mark VII for low-angle targets. Each gun was provided with 400 round of ammunition. Three octuple Mark VI 2-pounder mounts were fitted, two on a platform between the funnels and the third at the rear of the aft superstructure. Each was provided with a Mark III* director. Four quadruple Vickers .50-calibre Mark III mounts were also added, two each on the forward and rear superstructures. The submerged torpedo tubes were removed and eight above-water torpedo tubes added.
&quot;Repulse&quot; was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet when she recommissioned in April 1936. She transported 500 refugees from Palma, Majorca, to Marseilles, France, in late 1936 after the start of the Spanish Civil War. The ship was present at the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 20 May 1937 for George VI. &quot;Repulse&quot; was sent to Haifa in July 1938 to maintain order during the Arab Revolt. She was selected to convey the King and Queen during their May 1939 Canadian Tour and she was refitted between October 1938 and March 1939 for this role. The twin 4-inch AA guns were replaced by two more Mark V guns and two additional quadruple .50-calibre mounts were added. The King and Queen ultimately traveled aboard the liner RMS &quot;Empress of Australia&quot; while &quot;Repulse&quot; escorted them on the first half of the journey.

===Second World War===

The beginning of the Second World War found &quot;Repulse&quot; assigned to the Battlecruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet. She patrolled off the Norwegian coast and in the North Sea in search of German ships and to enforce the blockade. Early in the war &quot;Repulse&quot; had her aft triple 4-inch mount replaced by an 8-barrel 2-pounder mount. In late October she was transferred to Halifax with the aircraft carrier to protect convoys and search for German raiders. She escorted the convoy bringing most of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division to Britain in mid-December 1939 and was reassigned to the Home Fleet. The ship supported Allied operations during the Norwegian Campaign in April–June 1940. Accompanied by &quot;Renown&quot; and the 1st Cruiser Squadron, &quot;Repulse&quot; attempted to intercept the as it sailed from Trondheim to Germany in July. Until May 1941 the ship escorted convoys and unsuccessfully searched for German ships. On 22 May &quot;Repulse&quot; was diverted from escorting Convoy WS8B to assist in the search for the , but she had to break off the search early on 25 May as she was running low on fuel. The ship was refitted from June to August and received eight Oerlikon autocannon as well as a Type 284 surface gunnery radar. &quot;Repulse&quot; escorted a troop convoy around the Cape of Good Hope from August to October and was transferred to East Indies Command.

To deter Japanese aggression in the Far East in late 1941, Winston Churchill was determined to send a small group of fast capital ships, along with one modern aircraft carrier, to Singapore. &quot;Repulse&quot; was already in the Indian Ocean and was ordered to Colombo in November to rendezvous with the battleship where they would form Force Z. The carrier was supposed to join them, but she was delayed when she ran aground while working up in the Caribbean. The two ships, and their escorting destroyers, arrived in Singapore on 2 December. Force Z departed on the evening of 8 December in an attempt to destroy Japanese troop convoys and protect the army&#x27;s seaward flanks from any Japanese landings in their rear. They were spotted by a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft during the following afternoon and shadowed for the rest of the day. Admiral Sir Tom Phillips decided to cancel the operation as the Japanese were now alerted. Force Z turned back during the evening, but was spotted again early on the morning of 10 December. About four hours later Japanese bombers arrived and attacked &quot;Repulse&quot; from high altitude; she was slightly damaged by one bomb hit in her port hangar. The second wave consisted of torpedo bombers which missed &quot;Repulse&quot;, but scored at least one hit on &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. The third wave again consisted of high-altitude level bombers that missed &quot;Repulse&quot; entirely. The fourth wave of torpedo bombers managed to hit &quot;Repulse&quot; once amidships on her port side. The final wave of torpedo bombers hit &quot;Repulse&quot; with three more torpedoes and the ship capsized with the loss of 508 officers and men. The sinking of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; contributed to the rapid fall of Singapore and Malaya to the Japanese, and demonstrated the dominance of air power over the capital ships that had been the backbone of naval power since the 1600s.
&quot;Renown&quot; was recommissioned on 28 August 1939 as part of the Home Fleet. Much like her sister, she spent September patrolling in the North Sea, but was transferred to Force K in the South Atlantic to help search for the heavy cruiser . The ship joined Force H at the Cape of Good Hope in November to prevent &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; from breaking into the South Atlantic. She was unsuccessful in this, but sank the blockade runner SS &quot;Watussi&quot; on 2 December. She remained in the South Atlantic even after &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; was scuttled on 13 December and did not return to the Home Fleet until March 1940. The ship became flagship of the Battlecruiser Squadron when &quot;Hood&quot; was paid off to refit that month. &quot;Renown&quot; also supported British forces during the Norwegian Campaign and briefly engaged the German battleships and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; on 9 April. &quot;Renown&quot; opened fire first, but she was hit first by two shells that only slightly damaged her. A few minutes later she hit &quot;Gneisenau&quot; with one 15-inch and two 4.5-inch shells that knocked out the main fire-control director and damaged the rangefinder on &quot;A&quot; turret. The German ships were faster than &quot;Renown&quot; in the heavy weather and were able to successfully disengage. The ship was repaired from 20 April to 18 May and provided cover during the evacuation from Norway in early June. &quot;Renown&quot; was transferred to Force H at Gibraltar in August and relieved &quot;Hood&quot; as flagship.

In November 1940 Force H covered the small aircraft carrier as she flew off Hurricane fighters bound for Malta from a position south of Sardinia. Later that month Force H participated in the inconclusive Battle of Cape Spartivento. &quot;Renown&quot; bombarded Genoa on 9 February 1941 with little effect. &quot;Renown&quot; and Force H escorted convoys both inside and outside the Mediterranean in March–May 1941 before being summoned into the Atlantic to search for the &quot;Bismarck&quot;. Force H escorted another convoy to Malta in July and &quot;Renown&quot; returned home for repairs the next month. The ship was transferred to the Home Fleet in November when her repairs were complete. She provided cover for the inbound and outbound convoys to the Soviet Union in early March 1942. She became flagship of Force W which was formed to escort carriers carrying fighters to be flown-off for Malta in April–May.

&quot;Renown&quot; rejoined Home Fleet once those missions were completed, but was transferred to Force H in October 1942 to participate in Operation Torch. She returned to Britain to refit from February to June 1943. The ship brought Winston Churchill and his staff back from the Quebec Conference in September and conveyed them to the Cairo Conference in November. She rejoined the Home Fleet in December, just in time to be transferred to the Eastern Fleet a few weeks later. &quot;Renown&quot; arrived in Colombo at the end of January 1944 where she was flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron. In April she participated in Operation Cockpit, an airstrike against port and oil facilities on Sabang, off the island of Sumatra. The ship bombarded Japanese-occupied facilities on Car Nicobar in the Nicobar Islands and Port Blair in the Andaman Islands on 30 April – 1 May. &quot;Renown&quot; supported the airstrike against Surabaya, Java (Operation Transom) on 17 May as well as follow-on attack against Port Blair on 21 June. After another airstrike on 25 July on Sabang the ship bombarded the city. She bombarded facilities in the Nicobar Islands from 17 to 19 October. On 22 November &quot;Renown&quot; was replaced as flagship by and the ship began a refit at Durban from December to February 1945. She was recalled to home waters in March, lest the remaining German heavy ships make a final sortie, and reached Rosyth on 15 April. She was given a brief refit when this concern proved illusory and was placed in reserve in May 1945. &quot;Renown&quot; was partially disarmed in July when six of her 4.5-inch turrets were removed, as well as all of her light guns. The ship hosted a meeting between King George VI and President Truman on 3 August when the latter was en route home aboard the heavy cruiser . The decision to dispose of the ship was announced on 21 January 1948 and she was towed to Faslane for scrapping on 3 August.

<text>HMS &quot;Renown&quot; was the lead ship of her class of battlecruisers of the Royal Navy built during the First World War. She was originally laid down as an improved version of the s. Her construction was suspended on the outbreak of war on the grounds she would not be ready in time. Admiral Lord Fisher, upon becoming First Sea Lord, gained approval to restart her construction as a battlecruiser that could be built and enter service quickly. The Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Eustace Tennyson-D&#x27;Eyncourt, quickly produced a new design to meet Fisher&#x27;s requirements and the builders agreed to deliver the ships in 15 months. They did not quite meet that ambitious goal but the ship was delivered a few months after the Battle of Jutland in 1916. &quot;Renown&quot;, and her sister , were the world&#x27;s fastest capital ships upon completion.

&quot;Renown&quot; did not see action during the war and was reconstructed twice between the wars; the 1920s reconstruction increased her armour protection and made other more minor improvements; the 1930s reconstruction was much more thorough. The ship frequently conveyed royalty on their foreign tours and served as flagship of the Battlecruiser Squadron when &quot;Hood&quot; was refitting.

During the Second World War, &quot;Renown&quot; was involved in the search for the in 1939, participated in the Norwegian Campaign of April–June 1940 and the search for the in 1941. She spent much of 1940 and 1941 assigned to Force H at Gibraltar, escorting convoys and she participated in the inconclusive Battle of Cape Spartivento. &quot;Renown&quot; was briefly assigned to the Home Fleet and provided cover to several Arctic convoys in early 1942. The ship was transferred back to Force H for Operation Torch and spent much of 1943 refitting or transporting Winston Churchill and his staff to and from various conferences with various Allied leaders. In early 1944, &quot;Renown&quot; was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean where she supported numerous attacks on Japanese-occupied facilities in Indonesia and various island groups in the Indian Ocean. The ship returned to the Home Fleet in early 1945 and was refitted before being placed in after the end of the war. &quot;Renown&quot; was sold for scrap in 1948.

==Design and description==
Admiral Lord Fisher first presented his requirements for the new ships to the Director of Naval Construction (DNC) on 18 December 1914, before the ships had even been approved. He wanted a long, high, flared bow, like that on the pre-dreadnought , but higher, four 15-inch guns in two twin turrets, an anti-torpedo boat armament of twenty guns mounted high up and protected by gun shields only, speed of 32 knots using oil fuel, and armour on the scale of the battlecruiser . Within a few days, however, Fisher increased the number of guns to six and added two torpedo tubes. Minor revisions in the initial estimate were made until 26 December and a preliminary design was completed on 30 December.

During the following week the DNC&#x27;s department examined the material delivered for the two battleships and decided what could be used in the new design. The usable material was transferred to the builders, who had received enough information from the DNC&#x27;s department to lay the keels of both ships on 25 January 1915, well before the altered contracts were completed on 10 March.

&quot;Renown&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a maximum draught of . She displaced at normal load and at deep load. Her Brown-Curtis direct-drive steam turbines were designed to produce , which would propel the ship at . However, during trials in 1916, &quot;Renown&quot;″s turbines provided , allowing her to reach a speed of . The ship normally carried of fuel oil, but had a maximum capacity of . At full capacity, she could steam at a speed of for .

The ship mounted six 42-calibre BL 15-inch Mk I guns in three twin hydraulically powered turrets, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. Her secondary armament consisted of 17 BL 4-inch Mark IX guns, fitted in five triple and two single mounts. &quot;Renown&quot; mounted a pair of QF 3 inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns mounted on the shelter deck abreast the rear funnel. She mounted two submerged tubes for  torpedoes, one on each side forward of &#x27;A&#x27; barbette.

&quot;Renown&quot;″s waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour measured thick amidships. Her gun turrets were thick with roofs thick. As designed the high-tensile-steel decks ranged from in thickness. After the Battle of Jutland in 1916, while the ship was still completing, an extra inch of high-tensile steel was added on the main deck over the magazines. &quot;Renown&quot; was fitted with a shallow anti-torpedo bulge integral to the hull which was intended to explode the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and vent the underwater explosion to the surface rather than into the ship.

Despite these additions, the ship was still felt to be too vulnerable to plunging fire and &quot;Renown&quot; was refitted in Rosyth between 1 February and mid-April 1917 with additional horizontal armour, weighing approximately , added to the decks over the magazines and over the steering gear. Flying-off platforms were fitted on &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets in early 1918. One fighter and a reconnaissance aircraft were carried.

==Construction and service==
===1916–1925===

&quot;Renown&quot; was laid down by Fairfield at Govan, Glasgow, Scotland on 25 January 1915. The ship was launched on 4 March 1916 and completed on 20 September 1916, after the Battle of Jutland at the cost of £3,117,204. She served with the Grand Fleet in the North Sea during the remaining two years of the First World War. &quot;Renown&quot; was assigned to the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron for the duration of the war, but never during the war. On 12 December 1917 &quot;Renown&quot; put to sea with other elements of the fleet in an unsuccessful attempt to intercept the German 3rd Half-Flotilla of destroyers that had destroyed a Scandinavian convoy and most of its escorts off the coast of Norway. For the rest of the war the ships patrolled the North Sea uneventfully. Both &quot;Renown&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; were present at the surrender of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918.

When the Grand Fleet was disbanded in April 1919, &quot;Renown&quot; was assigned to the Battlecruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet. In June she was refitted in preparation for a tour of Canada, Newfoundland and the United States by Edward, Prince of Wales, and both flying-off platforms were removed. A rangefinder replaced the model in &#x27;Y&#x27; turret and a rangefinder was added to the armoured hood over the conning tower. From January to March 1920 &quot;Renown&quot; was refitted more extensively as a &quot;royal yacht&quot;. Her aft 4-inch mounting and both 3-inch AA guns were removed so that extra accommodation and a promenade deck could be built. A large deck house was built on the shelter deck between the funnels. The port side housed a squash court while the starboard side was a cinema. The ship sailed in March for Australia and New Zealand with the Prince of Wales and his entourage aboard and made many stops en route. She returned to Portsmouth in October and was placed in reserve in November.

&quot;Renown&quot; was recommissioned in September 1921 for a tour of India, the Philippines and Japan by the Prince of Wales and sailed from Portsmouth in October. The ship arrived back in Portsmouth in June 1922 and she was placed in reserve the following month. The ship began a reconstruction that same month along the lines of her sister, although changes were made based on the experiences with &quot;Repulse&quot;. &quot;Renown&quot;″s main armour belt was removed and a new 9-inch belt was installed, using up the remaining plates made surplus by the conversion of the battleship (originally ordered by Chile and purchased after the war began) to the aircraft carrier as well as new armour, but installed about higher than on &quot;Repulse&quot; to offset any increase in draught. A strake of tapered armour was fitted underneath the main belt to deflect any shell that dived beneath the water&#x27;s surface; it was 9-inches thick at top and thinned to at the bottom. The ship&#x27;s deck armour was heavily reinforced adjacent to its machinery spaces and magazines. Two longitudinal bulkheads were added between the upper and main decks that ran from the base of the conning tower to the end of the boiler rooms. The bulges were reworked and based on those used in the s although crushing tubes were only used abreast the magazines. The rear triple 4-inch gun mount was replaced. The flying-off platform on &#x27;B&#x27; turret was reinstated and a high-angle control position (HACP) was added to the fore-top. The pair of 3-inch AA guns and her two single four-inch gun mounts were replaced with four QF four-inch Mark V anti-aircraft guns. They had a maximum depression of -5° and a maximum elevation of 80°. They fired a high explosive shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of ten to fifteen rounds per minute. The guns had a maximum ceiling of , but an effective range of much less. The reconstruction only added to the ship&#x27;s displacement and three inches to her draught. This reconstruction cost £979,927.

===1926–1939===

&quot;Renown&quot; finished her reconstruction in September 1926 and she was assigned to the Battlecruiser Squadron until the ship was detached to convey The Duke and Duchess of York to Australia between January and July 1927. On the return journey, a boiler room caught fire on 26 May, burning four ratings before it was put out. Upon her return she rejoined the Atlantic Fleet. &quot;Renown&quot; became the flagship of the BCS when &quot;Hood&quot; was refitting between 1929 and 1931. &quot;Hood&quot; resumed the role as flagship after she was recommissioned and &quot;Renown&quot; was paid off for a refit of her own. A High-Angle Control System Mark I (HACS) was fitted with a director on the roof of the fore-top that replaced the high-angle rangefinder and the conning tower platform was enlarged to accommodate a pair of Mark V octuple mounts for the QF 2-pounder Mark VIII gun The Mark V mounts could depress to −10° and elevate to a maximum of 80°. The Mark VIII 2-pounder gun fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a distance of . The gun&#x27;s rate of fire was approximately 96–98 rounds per minute. Only one mount was initially available, however, and it, along with its director, was fitted on the starboard side. &quot;Renown&quot; had her midships triple 4-inch mount removed to make room for an aircraft catapult that was not fitted until 1933. The port Mark V 2-pounder mount was finally fitted, albeit without its director, that same year. The ship now carried a Fairey III floatplane for reconnaissance purposes. The flying-off platform was also removed.

&quot;Renown&quot; collided with &quot;Hood&quot; on 23 January 1935 while on exercises off the coast of Spain. The damage to her bow was temporarily repaired at Gibraltar and the ship sailed to Portsmouth for permanent repairs between February and May. The captains of both ships were court-martialled, as was the squadron commander, Rear Admiral Sidney Bailey. Bailey and &quot;Hood&quot;″s Captain Tower were acquitted, but &quot;Renown&quot;″s Captain Sawbridge was relieved of command. The Admiralty dissented from the verdict, reinstated Sawbridge, and criticised Bailey for ambiguous signals during the manoeuvre.

The ship participated in King George V&#x27;s Silver Jubilee Fleet Review at Spithead on 16 July. Together with &quot;Hood&quot;, &quot;Renown&quot; was sent to Gibraltar to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War of 1935–36 and transferred to Alexandria in January 1936 where she was assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron. She returned home in May and rejoined Home Fleet.

&quot;Renown&quot; began a much more thorough reconstruction in September 1936, based on that of the battleship . Her superstructure and funnels were razed to the level of the upper deck, her masts taken out and the ship&#x27;s main and secondary armament was removed. A large splinter-proof tower superstructure was built, topped with a director-control tower for the main armament and two HACS Mark IV directors. The armoured hood formerly mounted above the conning tower was reinstalled on the rear superstructure. The ship&#x27;s engines and boilers were replaced by Parsons geared turbines and eight Admiralty three-drum boilers operating at . This saved some of weight and allowed the two forward boiler rooms to be converted to magazines and other uses. &quot;Renown&quot;″s deck protection was somewhat upgraded by adding non-cemented armour where it had not been added earlier and protecting the new 4.5-inch magazines. As in &quot;Repulse&quot; hangars were built abreast her rear funnel and a catapult was fitted between the rear funnel and the aft superstructure.
The ship&#x27;s 15-inch gun turrets were modified to the Mark I (N) standard with their elevation increased to 30°. Twenty dual-purpose QF 4.5-inch Mark III guns in twin BD Mark II mountings replaced all of the 4-inch guns. Six of the gun turrets, three on each side, were abreast the forward funnel while the remaining four were mounted abreast the main mast. The BD Mark II mounts had elevation limits of −5° to +80°. The Mark III gun fired a high explosive shell at a new gun muzzle velocity of . Its rate of fire was 12 rounds per minute. They had a maximum effective ceiling of . The guns were controlled by four dual-purpose Mark IV directors, two mounted on the rear of the bridge structure and the remaining two on the aft superstructure. They fed tracking data to a HACS Mark IV analog computer for high-angle targets and an Admiralty Fire Control Clock Mark VII for low-angle targets. Each gun was provided with 400 rounds of ammunition. Three octuple Mark VI 2-pounder mounts were fitted, two on a platform between the funnels and the third at the rear of the aft superstructure. Each was provided with a Mark III* director. Four quadruple Vickers .50-calibre Mark III mounts were also added, two each on the forward and rear superstructures. The submerged torpedo tubes were removed and eight above-water torpedo tubes added. This reconstruction, at £3,088,008, was more than three times as expensive as her earlier reconstruction.

===Second World War===

&quot;Renown&quot; was recommissioned on 28 August 1939 as part of the Home Fleet. Much like her sister, she spent September patrolling in the North Sea, but was transferred to Force K in the South Atlantic in October to help search for the heavy cruiser . The ship joined Force H at the Cape of Good Hope in November to prevent &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; from breaking into the South Atlantic. She was unsuccessful in this, but sank the blockade runner SS &quot;Watussi&quot; on 2 December. She remained in the South Atlantic even after &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; was scuttled on 17 December and did not return to the Home Fleet until March 1940. The ship became flagship of the Battlecruiser Squadron when &quot;Hood&quot; was paid off to refit that month. &quot;Renown&quot; supported British forces during the Norwegian Campaign and engaged the German battleships and on 9 April.

&quot;Renown&quot; spotted the Germans ships and fired first, but she was hit first by two shells that only slightly damaged her. A few minutes later she hit &quot;Gneisenau&quot; with one 15-inch and two 4.5-inch shells that knocked out the ship&#x27;s main fire-control director and damaged the rangefinder on &#x27;A&#x27; turret. The German ships were faster than &quot;Renown&quot; in the heavy weather and were able to disengage after about 90 minutes. &quot;Renown&quot; expended 230 rounds from her main armament and 1,065 rounds from her secondary armament during the engagement. The ship was under repair from 20 April to 18 May and provided cover during the evacuation from Norway in early June. &quot;Renown&quot; was transferred to Force H at Gibraltar in August and relieved &quot;Hood&quot; as flagship.
In November 1940 Force H covered the small aircraft carrier as she flew off Hurricane fighters bound for Malta from a position south of Sardinia. Later that month Force H participated in the inconclusive Battle of Cape Spartivento. &quot;Renown&quot; bombarded Genoa on 9 February 1941 with little effect. Force H escorted convoys both inside and outside the Mediterranean in March–May 1941 before being summoned into the Atlantic to search for the . The ship intercepted the German supply ship &quot;Gonzenheim&quot;, which had been intended to supply &quot;Bismarck&quot;, on 4 June. &quot;Renown&quot; and Force H escorted another convoy to Malta in July and the ship returned home for repairs to her starboard bulge the next month. While the exact dates are not known, the ship received a variety of radars in 1941, possibly during this refit. These included Type 284 radar for surface gunnery control, Type 285 anti-aircraft gunnery radar, Type 281 air warning radar and a Type 271 surface search radar. Two quadruple &quot;pom-pom&quot; mounts were also fitted on top of &#x27;B&#x27; turret. &quot;Renown&quot; was transferred to the Home Fleet in November when her repairs were complete and became deputy fleet flagship when was detached to take Winston Churchill to the Arcadia Conference in Washington, D.C., on 9 December. She provided cover for the inbound and outbound convoys to the Soviet Union in early March 1942. &quot;Renown&quot; was relieved as flagship by &quot;Duke of York&quot; on 3 April, but became flagship of Force W which was formed to escort carriers carrying fighters to be flown-off for Malta in April–May. &quot;Renown&quot; rejoined Home Fleet once those missions were completed, but was transferred to Force H in October 1942 to participate in Operation Torch. She covered the invasion and follow-up convoys against interference by the French or Italian Fleets.
&quot;Renown&quot; returned to Britain to refit from February to June 1943; her catapult and aircraft were removed while the hangar was converted to a laundry and a cinema. She also received a total of 72 Oerlikon 20 mm light AA guns in 23 twin mounts and 26 single mounts fitted between July 1942 and August 1943. In January 1944 a quadruple &quot;pom-pom&quot; mounting was placed on the roof of &#x27;B&#x27; turret and the 20 mm guns there were moved. Additional light AA directors with Type 282 radars were also fitted during this time. The ship brought Winston Churchill and his staff back from the Quebec Conference in September and conveyed them to the Cairo Conference in November. She rejoined the Home Fleet in December, just in time to be transferred to the Eastern Fleet a few weeks later. &quot;Renown&quot; arrived in Colombo at the end of January 1944 where she became flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron. In April she participated in Operation Cockpit, an air strike against port and oil facilities on Sabang, off the island of Sumatra.
The ship bombarded Japanese-occupied facilities on Car Nicobar in the Nicobar Islands and Port Blair in the Andaman Islands on 30 April – 1 May. &quot;Renown&quot; supported the air strike against Surabaya, Java (Operation Transom) on 17 May as well as the follow-on attack against Port Blair on 21 June. After another air strike on 25 July on Sabang the ship bombarded the city. She bombarded facilities in the Nicobar Islands from 17 to 19 October. On 22 November &quot;Renown&quot; was replaced as flagship by and the ship began a refit at Durban from December to February 1945.

&quot;Renown&quot; was recalled in March lest the remaining German heavy ships make a final sortie and reached Rosyth on 15 April. She was given a brief refit when this concern proved illusory and was placed in reserve in May 1945. She was partially disarmed in July when six of her 4.5-inch turrets were removed preparatory to fitting these mountings with remote power control. The refit was subsequently cancelled. The ship hosted a meeting between King George VI and President Truman on 3 August when the latter was en route home aboard the heavy cruiser . The decision to dispose of the ship was announced on 21 January 1948 and she was towed to Faslane for scrapping on 3 August. She was the last British battlecruiser to be scrapped, outlasting by a few days.

<text>HMS &quot;Repulse&quot; was one of two s built for the Royal Navy during the First World War. Originally laid down as an improved version of the , her construction was suspended on the outbreak of war because she would not be ready in time. Admiral Lord Fisher, upon becoming First Sea Lord, gained approval for her to resume construction as a battlecruiser that could be built and enter service quickly. The Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Eustace Tennyson-d&#x27;Eyncourt, quickly produced an entirely new design to meet Admiral Lord Fisher&#x27;s requirements and the builders agreed to deliver the ship in 15 months. They did not quite meet that ambitious goal, but the ship was delivered a few months after the Battle of Jutland in 1916. &quot;Repulse&quot; and her sister ship were the world&#x27;s fastest capital ships upon completion.

&quot;Repulse&quot; participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1917, the only combat she saw during the war. She was reconstructed twice between the wars; a reconstruction in the 1920s increased her armour protection and made lesser improvements, while another in the 1930s was much more thorough. &quot;Repulse&quot; accompanied the battlecruiser during the Cruise of the Special Service Squadron on a round-the-world cruise in 1923 to 1924 and protected international shipping during the Spanish Civil War in 1936 to 1939.

The ship spent the first months of the Second World War hunting for German raiders and blockade runners. She participated in the Norwegian Campaign of April to June 1940 and searched for the in 1941. &quot;Repulse&quot; escorted a troop convoy around the Cape of Good Hope from August to October 1941 and was transferred to the East Indies Command. She was assigned in November to Force Z, which was supposed to deter Japanese aggression against British possessions in the Far East. &quot;Repulse&quot; and her consort, the battleship , were sunk by Japanese aircraft on 10 December 1941 when they attempted to intercept landings in British Malaya.

In December 2023, a memorial was erected at Teluk Cempedak beach, commemorating both &quot;Repulse&quot; and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. The memorial was unveiled by the King Abdullah of Pahang.

==Design and description==

Admiral Lord Fisher first presented his requirements for the new ships to the Director of Naval Construction (DNC) on 18 December 1914, before the ships had even been approved. He wanted a long, flared bow, like that on the pre-dreadnought but higher, four 15-inch guns in two twin-gun turrets, an anti-torpedo boat armament of twenty guns mounted high up and protected by gun shields only, a speed of 32 knots using oil fuel and armour on the scale of the battlecruiser . Within a few days Fisher increased the number of guns to six and added two torpedo tubes. Minor revisions in the initial estimate were made until 26 December and a preliminary design was completed on 30 December.

During the following week the DNC&#x27;s department examined the material delivered for the two battleships and decided what could be used in the new design. The usable material was transferred to the builders who had received enough information from the DNC&#x27;s department to lay the keels of both ships on 25 January 1915, well before the altered contracts were completed on 10 March.

&quot;Repulse&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of and a maximum draught of . She displaced at normal load and at deep load. The Brown-Curtis direct-drive steam turbines were designed to produce , which would propel the ship at . During trials in 1916, &quot;Repulse&quot;″s turbines provided , allowing her to reach a speed of . The ship normally carried of fuel oil but had a maximum capacity of . At full capacity, she could steam at a speed of for .

The ship mounted six 42-calibre BL 15-inch Mk I guns in three twin hydraulically powered gun turrets, &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. Her secondary armament consisted of 17 BL 4-inch Mark IX guns, fitted in five triple and two single mounts. &quot;Repulse&quot; mounted a pair of QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns mounted on the shelter deck abreast the rear funnel. She mounted two submerged tubes for  torpedoes, one on each side forward of &#x27;A&#x27; barbette.

&quot;Repulse&quot;″s waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour measured thick amidships. Her gun turrets were thick with roofs thick. As designed the high-tensile-steel decks ranged from in thickness. After the Battle of Jutland in 1916, while the ship was still completing, an extra inch of high-tensile steel was added on the main deck over the magazines. &quot;Repulse&quot; was fitted with a shallow anti-torpedo bulge integral to the hull which was intended to explode the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and vent the underwater explosion to the surface rather than into the ship.

Despite these additions, the ship was still felt to be too vulnerable to plunging fire and &quot;Repulse&quot; was refitted in Rosyth between 10 November 1916 and 29 January 1917 with additional horizontal armour, weighing approximately , added to the decks over the magazines and over the steering gear. &quot;Repulse&quot; was the first capital ship fitted with a flying-off platform when an experimental one was fitted on &#x27;B&#x27; turret in the autumn of 1917. Squadron Leader Frederick Rutland took off in a Sopwith Pup on 1 October. Another platform was built on &#x27;Y&#x27; turret and Rutland took off from it on 8 October. One fighter and a reconnaissance aircraft were normally carried.

==Service history==
===First World War===

&quot;Repulse&quot; was laid down by John Brown, Clydebank, Scotland on 25 January 1915. The ship was launched on 8 January 1916 and completed on 18 August 1916, after the Battle of Jutland. Her construction cost £2,829,087 (£ in 2025). She served with the Grand Fleet in the North Sea during the remaining two years of the First World War. &quot;Repulse&quot; relieved as flagship of the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron for the duration of the war.

====Second Battle of Heligoland Bight====
Over the course of 1917 the Admiralty became more concerned about German efforts in the North Sea to sweep paths through the British-laid minefields intended to restrict the actions of the High Seas Fleet and German submarines. A preliminary raid on German minesweeping forces on 31 October by light forces destroyed ten small ships and the Admiralty decided on a larger operation to destroy the minesweepers and their escorting light cruisers. Based on intelligence reports the Admiralty decided on 17 November 1917 to allocate two light cruiser squadrons, the 1st Cruiser Squadron covered by the reinforced 1st BCS (less &quot;Renown&quot;) and, more distantly, the battleships of the 1st Battle Squadron to the operation.

The German ships, four light cruisers of II Scouting Force, eight destroyers, three divisions of minesweepers, eight Sperrbrechers (cork-filled trawlers, used to detonate mines without sinking) and two trawlers to mark the swept route, were spotted at 7:30 a.m., silhouetted by the rising sun. The light battlecruiser and the light cruiser opened fire with their forward guns seven minutes later. The Germans responded by laying an effective smoke screen. The British continued in pursuit, but lost track of most of the smaller ships in the smoke and concentrated fire on the light cruisers as opportunity permitted. &quot;Repulse&quot; was detached not long after and raced forward at full speed to engage the enemy ships. She opened fire at about 9:00, scoring a single hit on the light cruiser during the battle. When the German battleships and were spotted about 9:50 the British broke off their pursuit and &quot;Repulse&quot; covered their retreat, aided by a heavy fog that came down around 10:40. The ship fired a total of 54 15-inch shells during the battle and scored one hit on the light cruiser &quot;Königsberg&quot; that temporarily reduced her speed.

On 12 December 1917, &quot;Repulse&quot; was damaged in a collision with the battlecruiser . The ship was present at the surrender of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918.

===Inter-war period===

&quot;Repulse&quot; began a major refit at Portsmouth on 17 December 1918 intended to drastically improve her armour protection. Her existing six-inch armour belt was replaced by armour plates made surplus by the conversion of the battleship (originally ordered by Chile and purchased after the war began) to the aircraft carrier . The original armour was fitted between the main and upper decks, above the new armour. Additional high-tensile plating was added to the decks over the magazines. The ship&#x27;s anti-torpedo bulge was deepened and reworked along the lines of that installed on the battleship . The bulge covered her hull from the submerged torpedo room to &#x27;Y&#x27; magazine, the inner compartments of which were filled with crushing tubes. The bulges added to her beam and to her draught. The refit added about to her displacement and raised her metacentric height to at deep load. Three rangefinders were also added as well as eight torpedo tubes in twin mounts on the upper deck. Both flying-off platforms were removed. This refit cost £860,684.
&quot;Repulse&quot; was recommissioned on 1 January 1921 and joined the Battlecruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet. In November 1923, &quot;Hood&quot;, accompanied by &quot;Repulse&quot; and a number of s of the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron, set out on a world cruise from west to east via the Panama Canal. They returned home ten months later in September 1924. Shortly after her return the ship&#x27;s two three-inch AA guns and her two single four-inch gun mounts were removed and replaced with four QF four-inch Mark V AA guns. The Battlecruiser Squadron visited Lisbon in February 1925 to participate in the Vasco da Gama celebrations before continuing on to the Mediterranean for exercises. A squash court was added on the starboard side between the funnels, and a sauna and bubble bath on the quarterdeck for the Prince of Wales&#x27; tour of Africa and South America that lasted from March to October. Upon her return, she was refitted from November 1925 to July 1926 and had a high-angle control position (HACP) added to her fore-top.

====1930s reconstructions====

After &quot;Repulse&quot; completed her 1926 refit, she remained in commission, aside from a brief refit from July to September 1927, with the Battlecruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet until she was paid off in June 1932 prior to beginning her reconstruction in April 1933. Most of the existing layers of high-tensile steel that constituted the ship&#x27;s horizontal armour were replaced by non-cemented armour plates in thickness and the torpedo control tower was removed from the aft superstructure. A fixed catapult replaced the midships 4-inch triple mount and a hangar was built on each side of the rear funnel to house two of the ship&#x27;s Fairey III aircraft. One additional aircraft could be carried on the deck and another on the catapult itself. Electric cranes were mounted above each hangar to handle the aircraft.

The four 4-inch AA guns were moved, one pair abreast the rear funnel at the level of the hangar roof and the other pair abreast the fore funnel on the forecastle deck. Four prototype QF 4-inch Mark XV dual-purpose guns were added in twin-gun Mark XVIII mounts abreast the mainmast. Two octuple Mark VI 2-pounder mounts were fitted on extensions of the conning-tower platform abreast the fore funnel. Above these a pair of quadruple Mark II* mountings for the 0.5-inch Vickers Mark III machine gun were added. These mounts could depress to −10° and elevate to a maximum of 70°. The machine guns fired a bullet at a muzzle velocity of . This gave the gun a maximum range of about , although its effective range was only &quot;Repulse&quot; received two High-Angle Control System anti-aircraft directors, one Mark II on the fore-top and a Mark I* mounted on a pedestal above the rear superstructure. The two submerged torpedo tubes were removed and the vacant spaces sub-divided and turned into store-rooms.
&quot;Repulse&quot; was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet when she recommissioned in April 1936. She transported 500 refugees from Valencia and Palma de Mallorca to Marseilles, France in late 1936 after the start of the Spanish Civil War. The ship was present at the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 20 May 1937 for King George VI. &quot;Repulse&quot; was sent to Haifa in July 1938 to maintain order during the Arab Revolt. She was selected to convey the King and Queen during their May 1939 Canadian Tour and she was refitted between October 1938 and March 1939 for this role. The twin 4-inch AA guns were replaced by two more Mark V guns and two additional quadruple .50-calibre mounts were added. The King and Queen ultimately travelled aboard the liner while &quot;Repulse&quot; escorted them on the first half of the journey.

===Second World War===
At the beginning of the Second World War, &quot;Repulse&quot; was part of the Battlecruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet. She patrolled off the Norwegian coast and in the North Sea in search of German ships, as well as to enforce the blockade for the first couple months of the war. Early in the war, the aft triple 4-inch gun mount was replaced with an 8-barrel 2-pounder mount. In late October, she was transferred to Halifax with the aircraft carrier to protect convoys and search for German raiders. &quot;Repulse&quot; and &quot;Furious&quot; sortied from Halifax on 23 November in search of the after it had sunk the armed merchant cruiser , but &quot;Repulse&quot; was damaged by heavy seas in a storm and was forced to return to port. &quot;Repulse&quot; escorted the convoy bringing most of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division to Britain from 10 to 23 December 1939 and was reassigned to the Home Fleet. In February 1940, she accompanied the aircraft carrier on a fruitless search for six German blockade runners that had broken out of Vigo, Spain.
&quot;Repulse&quot; was assigned to support Allied operations during the Norwegian Campaign in April–June 1940. On 7 April, &quot;Repulse&quot;, along with the bulk of the Home Fleet, was ordered to sea to intercept what was thought to be another attempt to break-out into the North Atlantic. The ship was detached the following day to search for a German ship reported by the destroyer , but the destroyer had been sunk by the before &quot;Repulse&quot; arrived and she was ordered to rendezvous with her sister &quot;Renown&quot; south of the Lofoten Islands, off the Norwegian coast. On 12 April, &quot;Repulse&quot; was ordered to return to Scapa Flow to refuel and she escorted a troop convoy upon her return. In early June the ship was sent to the North Atlantic to search for German raiders and played no part in the evacuation of Norway.

Accompanied by &quot;Renown&quot; and the 1st Cruiser Squadron, &quot;Repulse&quot; attempted to intercept the as it sailed from Trondheim to Germany in July. Until May 1941, the ship escorted convoys and unsuccessfully searched for German ships. On 22 May, &quot;Repulse&quot; was diverted from escorting Convoy WS8B to assist in the search for the , but she had to break off the search early on 25 May as she was running low on fuel. The ship was refitted from June–August and received six Oerlikon autocannon as well as a Type 284 surface gunnery radar. &quot;Repulse&quot; escorted a troop convoy around the Cape of Good Hope from August to October and was transferred to East Indies Command.

====Force Z====

In late 1941 Winston Churchill decided to send a small group of fast capital ships along with one modern aircraft carrier to Singapore, to deter expected Japanese aggression. In November, &quot;Repulse&quot; which was in the Indian Ocean was ordered to Colombo, Ceylon to rendezvous with the new battleship . The carrier , which was assigned to join them, was delayed when she ran aground in the Caribbean. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; and their escorting destroyers comprised Force Z, which arrived in Singapore on 2 December 1941. On the evening of 8 December, Force Z set out on an attempt to destroy Japanese troop convoys and protect the army&#x27;s seaward flanks from Japanese landings in their rear.

Force Z was spotted during the afternoon of 9 December by the , and floatplanes from several Japanese cruisers spotted the British ships later that afternoon and shadowed them until dark. Admiral Sir Tom Phillips decided to cancel the operation as the Japanese were now alerted. Force Z turned back during the evening, after having tried to deceive the Japanese that they were heading to Singora. At 00:50 on 10 December, Admiral Philips received a signal of enemy landings at Kuantan and correspondingly altered course so that he would arrive shortly after dawn.

The crew of spotted Force Z at 02:20, reported their position, and fired five torpedoes, all of which missed. Based on this report the Japanese launched 11 reconnaissance aircraft before dawn to locate Force Z. Several hours later 86 bombers from the 22nd Air Flotilla based in Saigon were launched carrying bombs or torpedoes. The crew of a Mitsubishi G3M reconnaissance bomber spotted the British at 10:15 and radioed in several reports. The pilot was ordered to maintain contact and to broadcast a directional signal that the other Japanese bombers could follow.
The first attack began at 11:13 when bombs were dropped from eight G3Ms from an altitude of . The battlecruiser was by two bombs, then hit by a third which penetrated through the hangar to explode on the armoured deck below. This inflicted a number of casualties and damaged the ship&#x27;s Supermarine Walrus seaplane, which was then pushed over the side to remove a fire hazard. Anti-aircraft fire damaged five of the Japanese bombers, two so badly that they immediately returned to Saigon. In the ensuing attacks, &quot;Repulse&quot; was skilfully handled by her captain, Bill Tennant, who managed to avoid 19 torpedoes as well as the remaining bombs from the G3Ms. The gunners on the &quot;Repulse&quot; shot down two planes and heavily damaged eight more. However, &quot;Repulse&quot; was then caught by a synchronised pincer attack by 17 Mitsubishi G4M torpedo bombers and hit by four or five torpedoes in rapid succession which proved fatal. At 12:23, &quot;Repulse&quot; listed severely to port, quickly capsized and went down by the stern with the loss of 508 officers and men. The destroyers and rescued the survivors, including Captain Tennant.

==Wreck==

HMS Repulse came to rest at , almost upside down with her starboard side elevated and her port side buried in the seabed at .
The wreck site was designated as a &#x27;Protected Place&#x27; in 2002 under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986, 60 years after her sinking.

Survivors described five torpedo hits on &quot;Repulse&quot;, four on the port side and one on the starboard side. The four portside hits purportedly were: two amidship, one abreast of the rear turret and one near the propellers. The starboard side hit was amidships. A 2007 diving expedition could confirm only two of the hits by examination of the wreck: the portside hit near the propellers and the starboard hit amidship. Unfortunately, at the time of the expedition, the portside midships section of the wreck was buried in the ocean floor thus the claimed hits there could not be confirmed. However, the area abreast of the port rear turret was accessible and no sign whatsoever of a torpedo hit, as described by survivors, was found.

In October 2014, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that both &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; were being &quot;extensively damaged&quot; with explosives by scrap metal dealers. In May 2023, it was reported that a Chinese ship, &quot;Chuan Hong 68&quot;, illegally scavenged the wreck for its low-background steel. In July 2024, this same vessel, &quot;Chuan Hong 68&quot;, suspected of not only looting the wrecks of Force Z but other World War II wrecks in Asian waters, was back &#x27;working&#x27; in the region and was subsequently detained by Malaysia authorities for &#x27;paperwork violations&#x27;.

<doc id="485656" wikidata="Q2553660" url="?curid=485656" title="HMS London (69)">
<text>HMS &quot;London&quot;, pennant number C69, was a member of the second group of the heavy cruisers of the Royal Navy. She and her sisters; , , and differed from the earlier group of Counties (known as the &quot;Kent&quot; class) by having a smaller forward superstructure, which was positioned slightly further aft, and little armour plating. HMS &quot;London&quot;″s career spanned over twenty years.

==Interwar career and rebuild==

&quot;London&quot; was laid down at Portsmouth Dockyard on 23 February 1926, and later launched on 14 September 1927 and commissioned on 31 January 1929. &quot;London&quot; served with the 1st Cruiser Squadron until March 1939, and was the flagship of Admiral Max Horton during his time in command of 1st Cruisers. Her flag captain during this time was Henry Harwood. From 1936 she was the flagship of Vice-Admiral Charles Kennedy-Purvis (later Sir Charles) and on 1 September 1937 she and her sister ship &quot; Sussex&quot; made a week-long goodwill visit to Venice, mooring opposite the Doges Palace. &quot;London&quot; and her sister ship &quot;Shropshire&quot; facilitated the evacuation of thousands of civilians from Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War. From March 1939 she was under reconstruction at the Chatham Dockyard, and was much altered in appearance. Replacement of her machinery was considered, but later abandoned. She was given a new superstructure above the main deck and in many ways resembled a light cruiser. Her single 4-inch gun mounts were changed to twin mounts, and several 20mm AA guns and radar were added. In addition, she was fitted with a 3½-inch cemented armoured belt, 8 feet deep down from the main armoured deck which covered the machinery spaces. The reconstruction work was finally completed in March 1941. The refit was planned to be implemented to other ships of the County class, but due to wartime pressures no other ships were reconstructed.

==Wartime career==

&quot;London&quot; was involved in the pursuit of the German battleship in May 1941. During this time at sea, many cracks appeared in her upper deck and hull, due to the weight of the new superstructure causing stresses. She entered a commercial shipyard on the River Tyne in October 1941 and was under repair until February 1942. &quot;London&quot; then spent from March 1942 to November 1942 in the North Atlantic on convoy protection duties in the company of several US Navy warships. This period of operations in the heavy North Atlantic seas caused hull cracks and popped rivets in her lower hull, necessitating the ship again going into the dry-dock in December 1942 for strengthening of the hull and for the fitting of newer and more refined radar, and of more light anti-aircraft guns. This refit rectified her hull and was completed in May 1943, with the ship ready for sea in July. After sea trials and loading of ammunition, she was assigned to operate off the South African coast and then to the Eastern Fleet for the rest of the war.

==Postwar, the &quot;Amethyst&quot; incident, and decommissioning==
Following the Second World War, and being the Royal Navy&#x27;s only modernised 8-inch gun cruiser, &quot;London&quot; was refitted for further service in early 1946 to allow her to serve in the postwar fleet. Following the refit she sailed for the far east in 1946 and served there for the next three years on the China Station.

In the spring of 1949 the frigate became trapped by advancing Communist Chinese forces up the Yangtze River. &quot;London&quot; sailed up the river as a show of strength in an attempt to help free the frigate. The Communist forces were not intimidated and took the cruiser under fire. &quot;London&quot; returned fire with her 8-inch and 4-inch guns, firing several hundred rounds, but was hit several times. Her two forward 8-inch turrets and &quot;X&quot; turret aft were damaged and rendered inoperable, and her bridge sustained several hits. &quot;London&quot; retreated down river and returned to Hong Kong for repairs which lasted until the end of July.

&quot;London&quot; remained in Chinese waters until August 1949, when she was relieved by , and she returned to the UK in the autumn of 1949. &quot;London&quot; was surveyed to determine if an extensive repair and refit for further service was feasible, but the condition of her machinery (dating back to 1928 and not replaced during her rebuild in the 1930s), as well as the large crew she required made her too expensive a proposition, given Britain&#x27;s post-war financial difficulties. She was retired to reserve in the River Fal until sold for scrapping in 1950.

<text>Olivier Le Jeune (died ) was an Afro-Canadian man noted as the first recorded slave purchased in New France.

==Background==
Olivier was born in Madagascar. Although he was a black African, he may have also been of partial Malay ancestry, which would have been quite common as Madagascar had been originally settled by diverse peoples of Southeast Asia and Oceania as well as Africa.

He is believed to have been approximately seven years of age when he was brought to the French colonial settlement of Quebec in New France by English privateer David Kirke or one of his brothers, Lewis and Thomas Kirke, during their capture of the settlement. Shortly afterwards, the boy was sold to Olivier Le Baillif, a French clerk in the pay of the expeditionary force which captured the settlement.

When Quebec was handed back to the French in 1632, Le Baillif left the colony and gave his slave to a Quebec resident, Guillemette Couillard. The boy was educated in a school established by the Jesuit priest Paul Le Jeune. In 1632, the boy said to Fr Le Jeune, &quot;You say that by baptism I shall be like you: I am black and you are white, I must have my skin taken off to be like you.&quot; Nevertheless, Fr Le Jeune baptised him Catholic with the name Olivier in 1633, after the colony&#x27;s head clerk, Olivier Letardif. Olivier later adopted the name Le Jeune, the surname of the Jesuit priest.

Olivier Le Jeune died on 10 May 1654. It is believed that by the time of his death his official status was changed from that of slave to that of free &quot;domestic servant&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Le Jeune was designated a National Historic Person by Parks Canada in 2022. A commemorative plaque is located at Cartier-Brébeuf National Historic Site, 175 de l&#x27;Espinay Street, Québec.

<text>&lt;onlyinclude&gt;The Nintendo 64 home video game console&#x27;s library of games were primarily released in a plastic ROM cartridge called the Game Pak. This strategic choice of high-performance but lower-capacity medium was met with some controversy compared to CD-ROM. Two small indentations on the back of each cartridge allow it to connect or pass through the system&#x27;s cartridge dustcover flaps. All regions have the same connectors, and region-locked cartridges will fit into the other regions&#x27; systems by using a cartridge converter or by simply removing the cartridge&#x27;s casing. However, the systems are also equipped with lockout chips that will only allow them to play their appropriate games. Both Japanese and North American systems have the same NTSC lockout, and Europe has a PAL lockout. A bypass device such as the N64 Passport or the Datel Action Replay can be used to play import games, but a few require an additional boot code.

The Nintendo 64 was first launched in Japan on June 23, 1996, with &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot;, and &quot;Saikyō Habu Shōgi&quot;; in North America with &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot;; and in Europe with &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. The final first-party games are &quot;Dōbutsu no Mori&quot; on April 14, 2001, in Japan, and &quot;Mario Party 3&quot; on May 7, 2001, in North America. The final licensed game to be published for the system is the North American exclusive &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot; on August 20, 2002. The best-selling game is &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; with 11 million units . The total unit sales of Nintendo 64 software has exceeded the total unit sales of GameCube software, but it has the lowest software sales per console sold among all Nintendo consoles.

There are games listed below. This list is initially organized by either the game&#x27;s English language title, or the Hepburn romanization of Japan-only releases. All English titles are listed first, followed by alternate titles, and there are no unofficial translations. Games for the 64DD peripheral and the Aleck 64 arcade system are not included in this list. For games that were announced or in development for the Nintendo 64, but never released, see the list of cancelled Nintendo 64 games.

<doc id="485669" wikidata="Q3187874" url="?curid=485669" title="Juanita Westmoreland-Traoré">
<text>Juanita Westmoreland-Traore, (born March 10, 1942) is the first black judge in the history of Quebec. She is also the first black dean of a law school (the University of Windsor Faculty of Law) in Canada&#x27;s history.

== Early life and education ==
Westmoreland-Traoré was born in Verdun, now part of Montreal, Quebec, in 1942, the daughter of immigrants from Guyana. She studied at Marianopolis College, and subsequently obtained a law degree from the Université de Montréal (1966) and a doctorate from the University of Paris.

== Career ==
She was called to the Quebec Bar in 1969, and began practising law in 1970 with the law firm of Mergler, Melançon. She has also been a member of the Ontario Bar since 1997. 
During the 1970s, Westmoreland-Traoré taught at the Université de Montréal from 1972 to 1976, and from 1976 to 1991 at the Université du Québec à Montréal. In 1990, Westmoreland-Traoré was an arbitrator to the Human Rights Tribunal of Quebec.
Westmoreland-Traoré was also a member of the Office de protection des consommateurs du Québec from 1979 to 1983. From 1983 to 1985, she was a Commissioner for the Canadian Human Rights Commission. In 1985, she became the first chair of Quebec&#x27;s Council on Cultural Communities and Immigration.

From 1991 to 1995, she was Employment Equity Commissioner of Ontario. In this role, she set up support to monitor the introduction of employment equity planning to seventeen thousand Ontario businesses. From 1996 to 1999 she was the dean of the University of Windsor&#x27;s law faculty. She was appointed a Judge of the Court of Quebec for the District of Montreal in 1999.

== Honours and awards ==
In 1991, she was made an Officer of the National Order of Quebec.
Westmoreland-Traoré has received other awards, including from Canadian Jewish Congress, the Montreal Association of Black Business Persons and Professionals, and the Canadian Bar Association.
In 2008, she was awarded the Quebec Human Rights Commission&#x27;s Rights and Liberties Prize for her career-long fight against discrimination.
 In 2021, she received the Medal of the Barreau de Montréal.

In March 2013, Université du Québec à Montréal&#x27;s Département des sciences juridiques founded the Juanita Westmoreland-Traoré scholarship. The $3000 scholarship is to be awarded annually to a single undergraduate law student who uses their training to promote human rights, social justice and equality. Sameer Zuberi, a human rights advocate of ten years, was the bursary&#x27;s first recipient in April 2014.

Westmoreland-Traoré received honorary doctorates from University of Ottawa in 1993, Université du Québec à Montréal in 2001, and McGill University in 2018.

<text>The Battle of Savo Island, also known as the First Battle of Savo Island and in Japanese sources as the , and colloquially among Allied Guadalcanal veterans as the Battle of the Five Sitting Ducks, was a naval battle during the Solomon Islands campaign of the Pacific War of World War II between the Imperial Japanese Navy and Allied naval forces. The battle took place on 8–9 August 1942 and was the first major naval engagement of the Guadalcanal campaign, the first of several naval battles in the straits later named Ironbottom Sound, near the island of Guadalcanal.

The Imperial Japanese Navy, in response to Allied amphibious landings in the eastern Solomon Islands, mobilized a task force of seven cruisers and one destroyer under the command of Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa. This task force sailed from Japanese bases in New Britain and New Ireland down New Georgia Sound (also known as &quot;The Slot&quot;) with the intention of interrupting the Allied landings by attacking the supporting amphibious fleet and its screening force. The Allied screen consisted of eight cruisers and fifteen destroyers under Rear Admiral Victor Crutchley, but only five cruisers and seven destroyers were involved in the battle. In a night action, Mikawa thoroughly surprised and routed the Allied force, sinking one Australian and three American cruisers, while suffering minimal damage in return. Rear Admiral Samuel J. Cox, director of the Naval History and Heritage Command, considers this battle and the Battle of Tassafaronga to be two of the worst defeats in U.S. naval history, surpassed only by the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941.

After the initial engagement, Mikawa, fearing Allied carrier strikes against his fleet in daylight, decided to withdraw under cover of night rather than attempt to locate and destroy the Allied invasion transports. The Japanese attack prompted the remaining Allied warships and the amphibious force to withdraw earlier than planned (before unloading all their supplies), temporarily ceding control of the seas around Guadalcanal to the Japanese. This early withdrawal of the fleet left the Allied ground forces (primarily United States Marines), which had landed on Guadalcanal and nearby islands only two days before, in a precarious situation with limited supplies, equipment, and food to hold their beachhead.

Mikawa&#x27;s decision to withdraw under cover of night rather than attempt to destroy the Allied invasion transports was based primarily on concerns over possible Allied carrier strikes against his fleet in daylight. In reality, the Allied carrier fleet, similarly fearing Japanese attack, had already withdrawn beyond operational range. This missed opportunity to cripple (rather than interrupt) the supply of Allied forces on Guadalcanal contributed to Japan&#x27;s failure to recapture the island. At this critical early stage of the campaign, it allowed the Allied forces to sufficiently entrench and fortify themselves and defend the area around Henderson Field until additional Allied reinforcements arrived later in the year.

The battle was the first of five costly, large-scale sea and air-sea actions fought in conjunction with the ground campaign on Guadalcanal, as the Japanese sought to counter the American offensive in the southern Pacific. These sea battles took place after increasing delays by each side to regroup and refit, until the 30 November 1942 Battle of Tassafaronga—after which the Japanese, due to increasing losses, resorted to resupplying their troops on Guadalcanal by submarine and barges. The final naval battle of the campaign, the Battle of Rennell Island, took place months later on 29–30 January 1943, by which time the Japanese were preparing to evacuate their remaining land forces and withdraw.

==Background==

===Operations at Guadalcanal===
On 7 August 1942 Allied forces (primarily U.S. Marines) landed on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida Island in the eastern Solomon Islands. The landings were meant to deny the use of these islands to the Japanese as bases, especially the nearly completed airfield that was being constructed on Guadalcanal. If Japanese air and sea forces were allowed to establish forward operating bases in the eastern Solomons, they would be in a position to threaten the critical supply routes between the U.S. and Australia. The Allies also wanted to use the islands as launching points for a campaign to recapture the Solomons, isolate or capture the major Japanese base at Rabaul, and support the Allied New Guinea campaign, which was then building momentum under General Douglas MacArthur. The landings initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign.

The overall commander of Allied naval forces in the waters around Guadalcanal and Tulagi was U.S. Vice Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher. He also commanded the carrier task groups providing air cover to Allied forces in the region. U.S. Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner commanded the amphibious fleet that delivered 16,000 Allied troops to Guadalcanal and Tulagi. Also under Turner was Rear Admiral Victor Crutchley&#x27;s screening force of eight cruisers, fifteen destroyers, and five minesweepers. This screening force was tasked with protecting Turner&#x27;s ships and providing gunfire support for the landings. Crutchley commanded his force of mostly American ships from his flagship, the Australian heavy cruiser .

The Allied landings took the Japanese by surprise. The Allies secured Tulagi, nearby islets Gavutu and Tanambogo, and the airfield under construction on Guadalcanal by nightfall on 8 August. On 7–8 August Japanese aircraft based at Rabaul attacked the Allied amphibious forces several times, setting fire to the U.S. transport ship (which later sank) and heavily damaging the destroyer . In these air attacks, the Japanese lost 36 aircraft, while the U.S. lost 19 aircraft, including 14 carrier-based fighter aircraft.

Concerned over the losses to his carrier aircraft in these initial engagements, anxious about the threat to his carriers from further Japanese air attacks, and worried about his ships&#x27; fuel supply, Fletcher announced that he would withdraw his carrier task forces on the evening of 8 August. Some historians contend that Fletcher&#x27;s fuel situation was not at all critical but that Fletcher used it to justify a premature withdrawal from the combat zone. Fletcher&#x27;s biographer notes that Fletcher concluded that the landing was a success and that no important targets for close air support were readily at hand. Turner, however, believed that Fletcher understood that he was to provide air cover until all the transports were unloaded on 9 August.

Even though the unloading was proceeding more slowly than planned, Turner decided that without carrier air cover, he would have to withdraw his ships from Guadalcanal. He planned to unload as much as possible during the night and depart the next day.

===Japanese response===
Unprepared for the Allied operation at Guadalcanal, the initial Japanese response included airstrikes and attempted reinforcement of troops on the island. Mikawa, commander of the newly formed Japanese Eighth Fleet headquartered at Rabaul, loaded 519 naval troops on two transports and sent them towards Guadalcanal on 7 August. When the Japanese learned that Allied forces at Guadalcanal were stronger than originally reported, the transports were recalled.

Mikawa also assembled all the available Japanese warships in the area to attack the Allied forces at Guadalcanal. At Rabaul were the heavy (Mikawa&#x27;s flagship), the light cruisers and , and the destroyer . En route from Kavieng were four heavy cruisers of Cruiser Division 6 under Rear Admiral Aritomo Goto: the and and the and , totaling 34 8-inch main guns.

The Japanese Navy had trained extensively in night-fighting tactics before the war, a fact of which the Allies were unaware. Mikawa hoped to engage the Allied naval forces off Guadalcanal and Tulagi on the night of 8–9 August when he could employ his night-battle expertise while avoiding attacks from Allied aircraft, which could not operate effectively at night. Mikawa&#x27;s warships rendezvoused at sea near Cape St. George on the evening of 7 August and then headed east-southeast.

==Battle==
===Prelude===

Mikawa decided to take his fleet north of Buka Island and then down the east coast of Bougainville. The fleet paused east of Kieta for six hours on the morning of 8 August to avoid daytime air attacks during its final approach to Guadalcanal. Mikawa proceeded along the dangerous New Georgia Sound (known as &quot;The Slot&quot;), hoping that no Allied plane would spot his force in the fading daylight. The Japanese fleet was in fact sighted in St. George Channel, where the column almost ran into , lying in ambush. She was too close to fire torpedoes, but her captain, Lieutenant Commander Henry G. Munson alerted the fleet. Once at Bougainville, Mikawa spread his ships out over a wide area to mask the composition of his force and launched four floatplanes from his cruisers to scout for Allied ships in the southern Solomons. 

At 10:20 and 11:10, his ships were spotted by Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Lockheed Hudson reconnaissance aircraft based at Milne Bay in New Guinea. The Hudson&#x27;s crew tried to report the sighting to the Allied radio station at Fall River, New Guinea. Receiving no acknowledgment, they returned to Milne Bay at 12:42 to ensure that the report was received as soon as possible. The second Hudson also failed to report its sighting by radio but completed its patrol and landed at Milne Bay at 15:00. For unknown reasons, these reports were not relayed to the Allied fleet off Guadalcanal until 18:45 and 21:30, respectively. U.S. official historian Samuel Morison wrote in his 1949 account that the RAAF Hudson&#x27;s crew failed to report the sighting until after they had landed and even had tea. This claim made international headlines and was repeated by many subsequent historians. Later research has discredited this version of events, and in 2014, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Naval History and Heritage Command acknowledged in a letter to the Hudson&#x27;s radio operator, who had lobbied for decades to clear his crewmates&#x27; name, that Morison&#x27;s criticisms were &quot;unwarranted.&quot;

Mikawa&#x27;s floatplanes returned around 12:00 and reported two groups of Allied ships, one off Guadalcanal and the other off Tulagi. By 13:00, he reassembled his warships and headed south through Bougainville Strait at . By 13:45, the cruiser force was near Choiseul southeast of Bougainville. At that time, several surviving Japanese aircraft from the noon torpedo raid on Allied ships off the coast of Guadalcanal flew over the cruisers on the way back to Rabaul and gave them waves of encouragement. Mikawa entered The Slot by 16:00 and began his run towards Guadalcanal. He communicated the following battle plan to his warships: &quot;On the rush-in we will go from S. (south) of Savo Island and torpedo the enemy main force in front of Guadalcanal anchorage; after which we will turn toward the Tulagi forward area to shell and torpedo the enemy. We will then withdraw north of Savo Island.&quot;

Mikawa&#x27;s run down The Slot was not detected by Allied forces. Turner had requested that U.S. Admiral John S. McCain Sr., commander of Allied air forces for the South Pacific Area, conduct extra reconnaissance missions over The Slot in the afternoon of 8 August. However, for unexplained reasons McCain did not order the missions, nor did he tell Turner that they were not carried out. Thus, Turner mistakenly believed that The Slot was under Allied observation throughout the day. However, McCain cannot totally bear fault as his patrol craft were few in number and operated over a vast area at the extreme limit of their endurance. Turner had fifteen scouting planes of the cruiser force, which were never used that afternoon and remained on the decks of their cruisers, filled with gasoline and serving as an explosive hazard to the cruisers.
To protect the unloading transports during the night, Crutchley divided the Allied warships into three groups. A &quot;southern&quot; group, consisting of the Australian cruisers HMAS &quot;Australia&quot; and , cruiser , and destroyers and , patrolled between Lunga Point and Savo Island to block the entrance between Savo Island and Cape Esperance on Guadalcanal. A &quot;northern&quot; group, consisting of the cruisers , and , and destroyers and , conducted a box-shaped patrol between the Tulagi anchorage and Savo Island to defend the passage between Savo and Florida Islands. An &quot;eastern&quot; group consisting of the cruisers and with destroyers USS &quot;Monssen&quot; and USS &quot;Buchanan&quot; guarded the eastern entrances to the sound between Florida and Guadalcanal Islands. Crutchley placed two radar-equipped U.S. destroyers to the west of Savo Island to provide early warning of any approaching Japanese ships. The destroyer patrolled the northern passage and the destroyer patrolled the southern passage, with a gap of between their uncoordinated patrol patterns. 

At this time, the Allies were unaware of the limitations of their primitive ship-borne radar, namely that the effectiveness of the radar could be greatly reduced by the presence of nearby landmasses. &quot;Chicago&quot;″s Captain Bode ordered his ship&#x27;s radar to be used only intermittently out of concern that it would reveal his position, a decision that conformed with general U.S. Navy radar usage guidelines but which may have been incorrect in this specific circumstance. He allowed a single sweep every half hour with the fire control radar, but the timing of the last pre-engagement sweep was too early to detect the approaching Japanese cruisers. Wary of the potential threat from Japanese submarines to the transport ships, Crutchley placed his remaining seven destroyers as close-in protection around the two transport anchorages.

The crews of the Allied ships were fatigued after two days of constant alert and action in support of the landings. Additionally, the weather was extremely hot and humid, inducing further fatigue and, in Morison&#x27;s words, &quot;inviting weary sailors to slackness.&quot; In response, most of Crutchley&#x27;s warships went to &quot;Condition II&quot; the night of 8 August, which meant that half the crews were on duty while the other half rested, either in their bunks or near their battle stations.
In the evening, Turner called a conference on his flagship off Guadalcanal with Crutchley and Marine commander Major General Alexander A. Vandegrift to discuss the departure of Fletcher&#x27;s carriers and the resulting withdrawal schedule for the transport ships. At 20:55, Crutchley left the southern group in &quot;Australia&quot; to attend the conference, leaving Bode in charge of the southern group. Crutchley did not inform the commanders of the other cruiser groups of his absence, contributing further to the dissolution of command arrangements. Bode, awakened from sleep in his cabin, decided not to place his ship in the lead of the southern group of ships, the customary place for the senior ship, and went back to sleep. At the conference, Turner, Crutchley, and Vandegrift discussed the reports of the &quot;seaplane tender&quot; force reported by the Australian Hudson crew earlier that day. They decided that it would not be a threat that night, because seaplane tenders did not normally engage in a surface action. Vandegrift said that he would need to inspect the transport unloading situation at Tulagi before recommending a withdrawal time for the transport ships, and he departed at midnight to conduct the inspection. Crutchley elected not to return with &quot;Australia&quot; to the southern force but instead stationed his ship just outside the Guadalcanal transport anchorage, without informing the other Allied ship commanders of his intentions or location.

As Mikawa&#x27;s force neared the Guadalcanal area, the Japanese ships launched three floatplanes for one final reconnaissance of the Allied ships, and to provide illumination by dropping flares during the upcoming battle. Although several of the Allied ships heard and/or observed one or more of these floatplanes, starting at 23:45, none of them interpreted the presence of unknown aircraft in the area as an actionable threat, and no one reported the sightings to Crutchley or Turner. Mikawa&#x27;s force approached in a single column led by &quot;Chōkai&quot;, with &quot;Aoba&quot;, &quot;Kako&quot;, &quot;Kinugasa&quot;, &quot;Furutaka&quot;, &quot;Tenryū&quot;, &quot;Yūbari&quot;, and &quot;Yūnagi&quot; following. Sometime between 00:44 and 00:54 on 9 August, lookouts in Mikawa&#x27;s ships spotted &quot;Blue&quot; about ahead of the Japanese column.

===Action south of Savo===
To avoid &quot;Blue&quot;, Mikawa changed course to pass north of Savo Island. He also ordered his ships to slow to to reduce wakes that might make his ships more visible. Mikawa&#x27;s lookouts spied either &quot;Ralph Talbot&quot; about away or a small schooner of unknown nationality. The Japanese ships held their course while pointing more than 50 guns at &quot;Blue&quot;, ready to open fire at the first indication that &quot;Blue&quot; had sighted them. When &quot;Blue&quot; was less than away from Mikawa&#x27;s force, she reversed course, having reached the end of her patrol track, and steamed away, apparently oblivious to the long column of large Japanese ships sailing past her. Seeing that his ships were still undetected, Mikawa turned back to a course south of Savo Island and increased speed, first to , and then to . At 01:25, Mikawa released his ships to operate independently of his flagship, and at 01:31 he ordered &quot;Every ship attack.&quot;

At about this time,&quot;Yūnagi&quot; detached from the Japanese column and reversed direction, perhaps because she lost sight of the other Japanese ships ahead of her, or perhaps because she was ordered to provide a rearguard for Mikawa&#x27;s force. One minute later, Japanese lookouts sighted a warship to port. This ship was the destroyer , heavily damaged the day before and departing Guadalcanal independently for repairs in Australia. Whether &quot;Jarvis&quot; sighted the Japanese ships is unknown, since her radios had been destroyed. &quot;Furutaka&quot; launched torpedoes at &quot;Jarvis&quot;, which all missed. The Japanese ships passed as close to &quot;Jarvis&quot; as , close enough for officers on &quot;Tenryū&quot; to look down onto the destroyer&#x27;s decks without seeing any of her crew moving about. If &quot;Jarvis&quot; was aware of the Japanese ships passing by, she did not respond in any noticeable way and was torpedoed and sunk the following day by aircraft from Rabaul. There were no survivors.

After sighting &quot;Jarvis&quot;, the Japanese lookouts sighted the Allied destroyers and cruisers of the southern force about away, silhouetted by the glow from the still-burning transport &quot;George F. Elliott&quot;. At about 01:38, the Japanese cruisers began launching salvos of torpedoes at the Allied southern force ships. At this same time, lookouts on &quot;Chōkai&quot; spotted the ships of the Allied northern force at a range of . &quot;Chōkai&quot; turned to face this new threat, and the rest of the Japanese column followed, while still preparing to engage the Allied southern force ships with gunfire.

&quot;Patterson&quot;″s crew was alert because the destroyer&#x27;s captain had taken earlier daytime sightings of Japanese warships and evening sightings of unknown aircraft seriously. At 01:43, &quot;Patterson&quot; spotted a ship, probably &quot;Kinugasa&quot;, dead ahead and immediately sent a warning by radio and signal lamp: &quot;Warning! Warning! Strange ships entering the harbor!&quot; &quot;Patterson&quot; increased speed to full and fired star shells towards the Japanese column. Her captain ordered a torpedo attack, but his order was not heard over the noise from the destroyer&#x27;s guns.

At about the same moment that &quot;Patterson&quot; sighted the Japanese ships and went into action, Japanese floatplanes dropped aerial flares directly over &quot;Canberra&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot;. &quot;Canberra&quot; responded with Captain Frank Getting ordering an increase in speed and a reversal of an initial turn to port, which kept &quot;Canberra&quot; between the Japanese and the Allied transports, and for her guns to train out and fire at any targets that could be sighted. As &quot;Canberra&quot;″s guns took aim at the Japanese, &quot;Chōkai&quot; and &quot;Furutaka&quot; opened fire on her, scoring numerous hits. &quot;Aoba&quot; and &quot;Kako&quot; joined in with gunfire, and &quot;Canberra&quot; took up to 24 large-caliber hits. Early hits killed her gunnery officer, mortally wounded Getting, and destroyed both boiler rooms, knocking out power to the entire ship before &quot;Canberra&quot; could fire any of her guns or communicate a warning to other Allied ships. The cruiser glided to a stop, on fire, with a 5- to 10-degree list to starboard, and unable to fight the fires or pump out flooded compartments due to of lack of power.
The crew of &quot;Chicago&quot;, observing the illumination of their ship by air-dropped flares and the sudden turn by &quot;Canberra&quot; in front of them, came alert and awakened Captain Bode. Bode ordered his guns to fire star shells towards the Japanese column, but the shells did not function. At 01:47, a torpedo, probably from &quot;Kako&quot;, hit &quot;Chicago&quot;″s bow, sending a shock wave throughout the ship that damaged the main battery director. A second torpedo struck &quot;Chicago&quot; but failed to explode, and a shell hit the cruiser&#x27;s mainmast, killing two crewmen. &quot;Chicago&quot; steamed west for 40 minutes,leaving behind the transports she was assigned to protect. The cruiser fired her secondary batteries at the trailing ships in the Japanese column and may have hit &quot;Tenryū&quot;, causing slight damage. Bode did not try to assert control over any of the other Allied ships in the southern force, of which he was still technically in command. More significantly, Bode made no attempt to warn any of the other Allied ships or personnel in the Guadalcanal area as his ship sailed away from the battle area.

Meanwhile, &quot;Patterson&quot; engaged in a gunnery duel with the Japanese column, receiving a shell hit aft that caused moderate damage and killed 10 crew members. &quot;Patterson&quot; continued to pursue and fire at the Japanese ships and may have hit &quot;Kinugasa&quot;, causing moderate damage. &quot;Patterson&quot; then lost sight of the Japanese column as it headed northeast along the eastern shore of Savo Island. &quot;Bagley&quot;, whose crew sighted the Japanese shortly after &quot;Patterson&quot; and &quot;Canberra&quot;, circled completely around to port before firing torpedoes in the general direction of the rapidly disappearing Japanese column; one or two of which may have hit &quot;Canberra&quot;. &quot;Bagley&quot; played no further role in the battle. &quot;Yūnagi&quot; exchanged non-damaging gunfire with &quot;Jarvis&quot; before exiting the battle area to the west with the intention of eventually rejoining the Japanese column north and west of Savo Island.

At 01:44, as Mikawa&#x27;s ships headed towards the Allied northern force, &quot;Tenryū&quot; and &quot;Yūbari&quot; split from the rest of the Japanese column and took a more westward course. &quot;Furutaka&quot;, either because of a steering problem, or to avoid a possible collision with &quot;Canberra&quot;, followed &quot;Yūbari&quot; and &quot;Tenryū&quot;. Thus, the Allied northern force was about to be enveloped and attacked from two sides.

===Action north of Savo===

When Mikawa&#x27;s ships attacked the Allied southern force, the captains of all three U.S. northern force cruisers were asleep, with their ships steaming quietly at . Although crewmen on all three ships observed flares or gunfire from the battle south of Savo or else received &quot;Patterson&quot;″s warning of threatening ships entering the area, it took some time for the crews to go from Condition II to full alert. At 01:44, the Japanese cruisers began firing torpedoes at the northern force. At 01:50, they aimed powerful searchlights at the three northern cruisers and opened fire with their guns.

&quot;Astoria&quot;″s bridge crew called general quarters upon sighting the flares south of Savo, around 01:49. At 01:52, shortly after the Japanese searchlights came on and shells began falling around the ship, &quot;Astoria&quot;″s main gun director crews spotted the Japanese cruisers and opened fire. &quot;Astoria&quot;″s captain, awakened to find his ship in action, rushed to the bridge and ordered a ceasefire, fearful that his ship might be firing on friendly forces. As shells continued to cascade around his ship, the captain ordered firing resumed less than a minute later. &quot;Chōkai&quot; had found &quot;Astoria&#x27;s&quot; range, and the ship was quickly hit by numerous shells and set afire. Between 02:00 and 02:15, &quot;Aoba&quot;, &quot;Kinugasa&quot;, and &quot;Kako&quot; joined &quot;Chōkai&quot; in pounding &quot;Astoria&quot;, destroying the cruiser&#x27;s engine room and bringing the flaming ship to a halt. At 02:16, one of &quot;Astoria&quot;″s remaining operational main gun turrets fired at &quot;Kinugasa&quot;″s searchlight but missed and hit one of &quot;Chōkai&quot;″s forward turrets, putting the turret out of action and causing moderate damage to the Japanese vessel. &quot;Astoria&quot; sank at 12:16 after all attempts to save her failed.

&quot;Quincy&quot; had also seen the aircraft flares over the southern ships, received &quot;Patterson&quot;″s warning, had just sounded general quarters and was coming alert when the searchlights from the Japanese column came on. &quot;Quincy&quot;″s captain gave the order to commence firing, but the gun crews were not ready. Within a few minutes, &quot;Quincy&quot; was caught in a crossfire between &quot;Aoba&quot;, &quot;Furutaka&quot;, and &quot;Tenryū&quot;, and was hit heavily and set afire. &quot;Quincy&quot;″s captain ordered his cruiser to charge towards the eastern Japanese column, but as she turned to do so &quot;Quincy&quot; was hit by two torpedoes from &quot;Tenryū&quot;, causing severe damage. &quot;Quincy&quot; managed to fire a few main gun salvos, one of which hit &quot;Chōkai&quot;″s chart room from Admiral Mikawa and killed or wounded 36 men, although Mikawa was not injured. At 02:10, incoming shells killed or wounded almost all of &quot;Quincy&quot;″s bridge crew, including the captain. At 02:16, the cruiser was hit by a torpedo from &quot;Aoba&quot;, and the ship&#x27;s remaining guns were silenced. &quot;Quincy&quot;″s assistant gunnery officer, sent to the bridge to ask for instructions, reported on what he found:

&quot;Quincy&quot; sank, bow first, at 02:38.
Like &quot;Quincy&quot; and &quot;Astoria&quot;, &quot;Vincennes&quot; also sighted the aerial flares to the south, and furthermore, actually sighted gunfire from the southern engagement. At 01:50, when the U.S. cruisers were illuminated by the Japanese searchlights, &quot;Vincennes&quot; hesitated to open fire, believing that the searchlight&#x27;s source might be friendly ships. &quot;Kako&quot; opened fire on &quot;Vincennes&quot; which responded with her own gunfire at 01:53. As &quot;Vincennes&quot; began to receive damaging shell hits, her commander, Captain Frederick L. Riefkohl, ordered an increase of speed to , but at 01:55 two torpedoes from &quot;Chōkai&quot; hit, causing heavy damage. &quot;Kinugasa&quot; joined &quot;Kako&quot; in pounding &quot;Vincennes&quot;. &quot;Vincennes&quot; scored one hit on &quot;Kinugasa&quot; causing moderate damage to her steering engines. The rest of the Japanese ships also fired and hit &quot;Vincennes&quot; up to 74 times, and at 02:03 was struck by another torpedo, this time from &quot;Yūbari&quot;. With all boiler rooms destroyed, &quot;Vincennes&quot; came to a halt, burning &quot;everywhere&quot; and listing to port. At 02:16, Riefkohl ordered the crew to abandon ship, and &quot;Vincennes&quot; sank at 02:50.

During the engagement, the U.S. destroyers &quot;Helm&quot; and &quot;Wilson&quot; struggled to see the Japanese ships. Both destroyers briefly fired at Mikawa&#x27;s cruisers but caused no damage and received no damage to themselves. At 02:16, the Japanese columns ceased fire on the northern Allied force as they moved out of range around the north side of Savo Island. &quot;Ralph Talbot&quot; encountered &quot;Furutaka&quot;, &quot;Tenryū&quot;, and &quot;Yūbari&quot; as they cleared Savo Island. The Japanese ships fixed &quot;Ralph Talbot&quot; with searchlights and hit her several times with gunfire, causing heavy damage, but &quot;Ralph Talbot&quot; escaped into a nearby rain squall, and the Japanese ships left her behind.

===Mikawa&#x27;s decision===
At 02:16 Mikawa conferred with his staff about whether they should turn to continue the battle with the surviving Allied warships and try to sink the Allied transports in the two anchorages. Several factors influenced his ultimate decision to withdraw. His ships were scattered and would take some time to regroup. Additionally, his ships would need to reload their torpedo tubes, a labor-intensive task that would consume valuable time. Mikawa also did not know the number and locations of any remaining Allied warships, and his ships had expended much of their ammunition.

More importantly, Mikawa had no air cover and believed that U.S. aircraft carriers were in the area. Mikawa was probably aware that the Japanese Navy had no more heavy cruisers in production and thus would be unable to replace any he might lose to air attack the next day if he remained near Guadalcanal. He was unaware that the U.S. carriers had withdrawn from the combat zone and would not be a threat the next day. Although several of Mikawa&#x27;s staff urged an attack on the Allied transports, the ultimate consensus was to withdraw from the battle area. Therefore, at 02:20, Mikawa ordered his ships to retire.

==Aftermath==

===Allied===
At 04:00 on 9 August, &quot;Patterson&quot; came alongside &quot;Canberra&quot; to assist the cruiser in fighting her fires. By 05:00, it appeared that the fires were almost under control, but Turner, who at this time intended to withdraw all Allied ships by 06:30, ordered the ship to be scuttled if she was not able to accompany the fleet. After the survivors were removed, the destroyers and sank &quot;Canberra&quot;, which took some 300 shells and five torpedoes.

Later in the morning, Vandegrift advised Turner that he needed more supplies unloaded from the transports before they withdrew. Therefore, Turner postponed the withdrawal of his remaining ships until mid-afternoon. In the meantime, &quot;Astoria&quot;″s crew tried to save their sinking ship. &quot;Astoria&quot;″s fires eventually raged completely out of control, and the ship sank at 12:15.

On the morning of 9 August, an Australian coastwatcher on Bougainville radioed a warning of a Japanese airstrike on the way from Rabaul. The Allied transport crews ceased unloading for a time but were puzzled when the airstrike did not materialize. Allied forces did not discover until after the war was over that this Japanese airstrike instead concentrated on &quot;Jarvis&quot; south of Guadalcanal, sinking her with all hands. The Allied transports and warships all departed the Guadalcanal area by nightfall on 9 August. During the naval surface battle of Savo Island, three U.S. heavy cruisers, (219 killed), (370 killed), and (322 killed), and one Australian heavy cruiser, (84 killed), were sunk or scuttled. The commanding officers of &quot;Canberra&quot; and &quot;Quincy&quot; were also killed in action. spent the next 6 months in drydock, returning to Guadalcanal in late January 1943 only to be promptly sunk in the campaign&#x27;s last engagement off Rennell Island.

===Japanese===
In the late evening of 9 August, Mikawa on &quot;Chōkai&quot; released the four cruisers of Cruiser Division 6 to return to their home base at Kavieng. At 08:10 on 10 August, &quot;Kako&quot; was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine from her destination. The other three Japanese cruisers picked up all but 71 of her crew and continued on to Kavieng.

Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto signaled a congratulatory note to Mikawa on his victory, stating, &quot;Appreciate the courageous and hard fighting of every man of your organization. I expect you to expand your exploits and you will make every effort to support the land forces of the Imperial army which are now engaged in a desperate struggle.&quot; Later on, though, when it became apparent that Mikawa had missed an opportunity to destroy the Allied transports, he was intensely criticised by his comrades.

==Tactical result==
From the time of the battle until several months later, almost all Allied supplies and reinforcements sent to Guadalcanal came by transports in small convoys, mainly during daylight hours, while Allied aircraft from the New Hebrides and Henderson Field and any available aircraft carriers flew covering missions. During this time, Allied forces on Guadalcanal received barely enough ammunition and provisions to withstand several intense drives by Japanese ground forces to retake the islands. For several weeks after the naval defeat off Savo Island, Japanese warships maintained command of the sea around Guadalcanal, particularly at night. Japanese naval commanders took advantage of this by carrying out multiple intense shore bombardments of Allied ground forces at Henderson Field well into late fall 1942. Although these bombardments destroyed several Allied aircraft and damaged valuable supply stocks, they ultimately were not enough to facilitate a collapse of the Allied perimeter on the island.

Despite their defeat in this battle, the Allies eventually won the larger battle for Guadalcanal, an important step in the defeat of Japan. In hindsight, according to Richard B. Frank, if Mikawa had elected to risk his ships and go after the Allied transports on the morning of 9 August, he could have improved the chances of Japanese victory in the Guadalcanal campaign at its inception, potentially altering the course of the war in the Pacific. Although the Allied warships at Guadalcanal that night were completely routed, the transport fleet remained unaffected. Many of these same transports were later used many times to bring crucial supplies and reinforcements to Allied forces on Guadalcanal over succeeding months. Mikawa&#x27;s decision not to destroy the Allied transport ships when he had the opportunity proved to be a crucial strategic mistake for the Japanese.

==U.S. Navy board of inquiry==

A formal United States Navy board of inquiry, known as the Hepburn Investigation, prepared a report of the battle. The board interviewed most of the major Allied officers involved over several months, beginning in December 1942. The report recommended official censure for Captain Howard D. Bode of the &quot;Chicago&quot; for failing to broadcast a warning to the fleet of encroaching enemy ships. The report stopped short of recommending formal action against other Allied officers, including Admirals Fletcher, Turner, McCain, and Crutchley, and Captain Riefkohl. The careers of Turner, Crutchley, and McCain do not appear to have been affected by the defeat or the mistakes they made in contributing to it. Riefkohl never commanded ships again. Bode, upon learning that the report was going to be especially critical of his actions, shot himself in his quarters at Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, on 19 April 1943 and died the next day. Crutchley was later gazetted with the Legion of Merit (Chief Commander).

Admiral Turner assessed why his forces were so soundly defeated in the battle:

Historian Frank adds that &quot;This lethargy of mind would not be completely shaken off without some more hard blows to (U.S.) Navy pride around Guadalcanal, but after Savo, the United States picked itself up off the deck and prepared for the most savage combat in its history.&quot;

The report of the inquiry caused the U.S. Navy to make many operational and structural changes. All the earlier models of U.S. Navy cruisers were retrofitted with emergency diesel-electric generators. The fire mains of the ships were changed to a vertical loop design that could be broken many times and still function. During the battle, many ship fires were attributed to aviation facilities filled with gas, oil, and planes. Motorboats were filled with gasoline and also caught fire. In some cases, these facilities were dead amidships, presenting a perfect target for enemy ships at night. Ready-service lockers (lockers containing ammunition that is armed and ready for use) added to the destruction, and it was noted that the lockers were never close to being depleted, i.e., they contained much more dangerous ammunition than they needed to. A focus was put on removing or minimizing flammable amidship materials. Admiral Ernest J. King, the commander in chief of the United States Fleet, ordered sweeping changes to be made before ships entered surface combat in the future.

<doc id="485683" wikidata="Q7833750" url="?curid=485683" title="1993 Sukhumi airliner attacks">
<text>From 20 to 23 September 1993, during the Sukhumi massacre, separatists in Sukhumi, Abkhazia blocked Georgian troops&#x27; overland supply routes as part of the war in Abkhazia. In response, the Georgian government used Sukhumi Babushara Airport to ferry supplies to troops stationed in Sukhumi. Abkhaz forces attacked the airport in an attempt to further block the supply routes.

During the siege of the airport, five civilian airliners belonging to Transair Georgia and Orbi Georgian Airways were hit by missiles allegedly fired by separatists in Sukhumi. Over 130 people died in the attacks.

== 20 September ==
Two Orbi Georgian Airways&#x27; Tupolev Tu-134As (65808 and 65809) were destroyed by Abkhaz small arms fire or missiles with no casualties.
== 21 September ==
A Transair Тu-134А-3 (built in 1975 with registration 65893 and factory number 5340120) was flying to Sukhumi from Sochi International Airport. The crew consisted of captain Geras Georgievich Tabuev, first officer Otar Grigorievich Shengelia, navigator Sergey Alexandrovich Shah, flight engineer Vladimir Vasilievich Nazarko, as well as two flight attendants; Ketevan Shalvovna Kvaratsheliya and Olga Mikhailovna Morgunova. Тhe 22 passengers were mainly journalists. At 16:25, at an altitude of , the aircraft was hit on approach to Sukhumi-Babusheri Airport by a Strela 2 surface-to-air missile. The missile had been fired from an Abkhaz boat commanded by Toriy Achba. The plane crashed into the Black Sea, killing all five crew members and 22 passengers. Other sources reported 28 people on board (six crew members and 22 passengers).

== 22 September ==
An Orbi Georgian Airways Tu-154B aircraft (built in 1976 with registration 85163 and factory number 76А163) flying from Tbilisi and carrying civilians and internal security forces was on approach to Sukhumi-Babusheri Airport when it was struck by a surface-to-air missile, fired from a patrol boat by Abkhaz soldier Bulat Amayev. The plane crash-landed on the airstrip; the ensuing fire killed 108 of the 132 passengers and crew, making the incident the deadliest aviation disaster to occur in Georgia. Georgian media claimed that the flight was carrying refugees, but there was no factual evidence to back up these claims.

Another Tu-154 was attacked later in the evening, but landed safely.

== 23 September ==
Passengers were boarding a Transair Tu-134A (built in 1975 with registration CCCP-65001 and factory number 42235) at Sukhumi when it was struck by rockets from an Abkhaz BM-21 Grad rocket launcher. It caught fire and burned, leaving one crew member dead. The aircraft was due to operate a Sukhumi-Tbilisi service.

On the same day, an ORBI Tu-154 (registration 85359) was reportedly destroyed by mortar or artillery fire.

<text>A fakaleitī (or &quot;leiti&quot; or &quot;fakafefine&quot; or &quot;lady&quot;) is a Tongan male at birth who has a feminine gender expression. The term &quot;fakaleitī&quot; is made up of the prefix &quot;faka-&quot; (in the manner of) and the borrowing &quot;lady&quot; from English. &quot;Fakaleitī&quot;s themselves prefer to call themselves &quot;leitī&quot; or &quot;ladies&quot;. 

Although leitī in Tonga do not necessarily associate with LGBT identities in the Western world, those who grow up in Tongan migrant communities in New Zealand, Australia, and the United States may find a greater level of community and affinity to similar identities than leitī in the island kingdom.

Leitī or fakafefine are similar to Samoan fa&#x27;afafine and Hawaiian .

The Tonga Leitis&#x27; Association organizes the Miss Galaxy Pageant in Tonga. They have also been involved in reforming colonially influenced laws about leitī life that remain in Tonga. In 2018 a documentary film, &quot;Leitis in Waiting&quot;, was made about leitī leader Joey Mataele and the efforts of the Tonga Leitis&#x27; Association. Mataele also works with the Pacific Equality Project, a non-profit group advocating for the decriminalization of LGBT peoples from post-colonial laws in the Pacific Islands.

<text>A teaching hospital is a hospital or medical center that provides medical education and training to future and current health professionals. Teaching hospitals are often affiliated with medical schools and work closely with medical students throughout their period of matriculation, and especially during their clerkship (internship) years. In most cases, teaching hospitals also offer graduate medical education (GME)/physician residency programs, where medical school graduates train under a supervising (attending) physician to assist with the coordination of care.

In addition to offering medical education to medical students and physician residents, many teaching hospitals also serve as research institutes.

==Origin==
Although institutions for caring for the sick are known to have existed much earlier in history, the first teaching hospital, where students were authorized to methodically practice on patients under the supervision of physicians as part of their education, was reportedly the Academy of Gundishapur in the Persian Empire during the Sassanid era.

== History in the United States==
The first teaching hospital in the United States was founded at the College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania) in 1765. Following that were King&#x27;s College of New York in 1768, Harvard University in 1783, Dartmouth College in 1798, and Yale University in 1810 to begin the history of notable university-affiliated teaching hospitals in America.

=== Clinical teaching 1800–1900 ===
Between 1810 and 1910, almost 400 medical schools were opened, however none were yet associated with local hospitals. However, many of them were inferior to those created by the University of Pennsylvania in 1874 and Lakeside Hospital in Cleveland in 1898. This is in part due to publishing of the Flexner Report which revealed the weaknesses of the United States current system for clinical teaching. Of the 400 medical schools established, the majority did not have control of hospital facilities, such as wards, to be used for teaching and research. As a result, these institutions could not adapt at clinical curriculum of learning by doing, which the Flexner Report supported as the most effective method of clinical education. Additionally, many states mandated all physician to earn a state license of practice. By 1895, every state was obliged to create a board of medical examiners to design and administer standardized state examinations in a range of topics from those mainly in medicine to pathology and pharmacology. The introduction of state examinations reduced the number of medical students practicing. The increasing requirements for medical schools and future practitioners led to the immediate closure of many medical schools in the United States.

While the provisions listed above led to closure of many universities, but also an increased quality of teaching at the available medical education schools.

=== The rise of teaching hospitals in the 20th-century United States ===
Before the start of the twentieth century, very few university teaching hospitals even existed within the United States. Those that did exist, however, received very little public support and confidence. Following the publishing of the Flexner Report in 1910, clinical instruction was revised and thus led to the development of teaching hospitals across the United States. Many were established with the aim of engaging medical students in clinical practice, improving patient care and services, and expanding the local and global impact of medical institutions through both medical education and research.

The prevalence of teaching hospitals grew with great force. In 1910, three notable universities and hospitals unified: the College of Physicians and Surgeons (Columbia University) with Presbyterian Hospital in New York; Harvard Medical School with the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston; and Washington University Medical School with the Barnes and St. Louis Children&#x27;s Hospital in St. Louis.

Efforts to establish these teaching hospitals in Boston, New York and St. Louis required the collective efforts on the part of the universities and their medical schools. To do so they had to persuade the hospital&#x27;s board of trustees or the local and state governments to provide the necessary funds for hospitals to be used for clinical education. As an example, in 1914 the University of Nebraska&#x27;s Dean of the College of Medicine proposed to the Nebraska legislature reason for why funds should be put towards the development of the university-affiliated teaching hospital. They argued that &quot;every Medical College of any standing in the country is associated either with a university hospital, ... or controls a large number of beds in a municipal Institution.&quot;

However, in many cities, local politics was a large force hindering the movement. In 1919, the Denver Colorado School of Medicine, politically appointed city officials assumed the greatest control over the universities teaching hospital. In their position, these officials took decisions without consultation of the medical school, thus limiting the school&#x27;s control over how they would clinically train their students. It was such issues that caused closure of many medical schools and created discrepancies in teaching practices across medical schools.

Many medical schools struggled to persist as a result of increasingly strict American Medical Association (AMA) guidelines mandating that medical schools secure control over a large hospital. In 1913, for example, Drake University College of Medicine dropped from the highest class of medical schools as the AMA noted that they were not strongly affiliated with a large, local hospital. However, for the university lacked $3,000,000 to build a &quot;first-rate&quot; and thus considered merging their schools with the Iowa State University.

By 1921, every remaining medical school was affiliated with a hospital as either an owner or a partner. As more universities and local hospitals established affiliations, there were improvements in patient care as there was an increased number of doctors available to observe and treat ill patients. For acutely ill patients, teaching hospitals were significant advancements as there was always a medical professional on staff to observe and handle emergencies. As the number of medical professionals on staff increased, there was also an apparent improvement in the accuracy and care taken in the diagnosis of patients. This gave medical professionals a greater understanding of both existing and novel conditions which contributed to effective treatments and remedies.

Additionally, the transition of the country to a more scientific nature of medical knowledge and practice and notable scientific advancements of the early 19th century made practitioners and students skilled in areas ranging from chemistry to immunology. This greater knowledge in science and technology was not only valuable to their clinical practice, but it also helped medical scientists garner more respect in the eyes of the public.

Furthermore, the quality of patient care improved as the American Medical Association enacted stricter guidelines for accepting medical students. Higher entrance requirements ensured that all medical school candidates were more intelligent and good mannered than previous classes of admitted medical students. For example, the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital benefited from its affiliation to the Harvard Medical School as renowned scientists Walter Cannon, William Councilman, and Otto Folin joined their medical staff.

The establishment of teaching hospitals also created more opportunity for scientific research within the hospital itself. As a consequence of the popular viewpoint that the hospital has the responsibility to foster research, there was an increased need of unions between Universities and Hospitals. Many universities were motivated to pursue medical research to bring their universities global recognition.

Such affiliations were also economically advantageous as hospitals served as teaching facilities for medical students that would otherwise be unavailable to them. Similarly, Medical schools made available specialized staff that were equipped and maintained hospital labs. In the case of Washington University in St. Louis, the university&#x27;s medical school provided the joint Children&#x27;s and Barnes Hospital with laboratories, salaries for physicians, and even a power plant that served the entire medical complex.

As the 1920s progressed however, the persistent control local politicians control over teaching practices made it difficult to standardize clinical curriculums nationwide. These schools differed on issues such as how many students were practicing each day, at what year students in their education should have clinical experiences, and even what hours these students should be admitted into wards—although it was odd to see a student in these wards during night rotations. By the 1950s, most medical students themselves began to describe their responsibilities as &quot;modest&quot;

== General organization and structure ==
Teaching hospitals rose to prevalence in the United States beginning the early 1900s and they largely resembled those established by Johns Hopkins University, the University of Pennsylvania and the Lakeside Hospital in Cleveland. The hospitals that followed the example of these universities were all very large, technologically sophisticated and aimed to have a global impact through both patient care and scientific research. Additionally, these hospitals had large patient bases, an abundant financial resources, and renowned physicians, advisors and staff. Many of the medical schools that ensued the prospect of being associated to a nearby hospital tended to be private institutions that received philanthropic support.

=== Hierarchy ===
In the initial design of the teaching hospital, universities were given autonomy to appoint medical staff of the hospital and hospital trustees gave consent to physicians and medical students for using their hospital for both clinical and scientific work. Under the same model, students were given smaller responsibilities including changing dressings, taking blood samples and analyzing for specimen, handling catheters and treating patients with minor injuries.

As teaching hospitals serve as locations for further medical education, it consists of many levels of doctors/doctors-in-training. The first of these is completing an internship. Sometimes referred to as first-year residents, interns are doctors completing their first year of training after graduating from medical school. This stage is completed under complete supervision, as it is before they are licensed. The next stage is residency. Residency can be anywhere between a four to eight-year process, depending on the hospital. A resident completes at least three years of supervised hands-on training within these years as a transition into their unsupervised patient care. The level of residency also contains sub-levels, being junior resident, senior resident, and chief resident. After this, some doctors move onto fellowship, which is where they declare a focus in a certain type of medicine and work directly under attending physicians. Attending physicians or more simply Attendings are responsible for making most direct patient-care decisions in a hospital. They answer to the head of their department. These are all below the overseer of all staff: the medical director. He or she is responsible for policies, practices, and keeping all others in check.

This hierarchy exists in each of the departments in a hospital, which are divided into broad specialties, all having more specific discipline (focus) of their own. The structure of these specialties began with the Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1888 and the creation of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, with their first four departments being Medicine, Surgery, Pathology, and Gynecology.

=== Funding and resources ===
While some funding comes from Medicaid for the GME process, teaching hospitals must consider paying residents and fellows within their budgets. These additional costs vary between hospitals based on funding by Medicaid and their general salary for residents and fellows.  Despite these costs, they are often offset by the prices of procedures which are elevated in comparison to most non-teaching hospitals. Teaching hospitals often justify this additional cost factor by boasting that their quality of care rises above non-teaching hospitals, or ensuring the patient that they are improving medicine of the future by having their procedure done with medical trainees present.

== Treatment and services ==
Given its orientation to providing hands-on clinical work to medical and residency students, teaching hospitals use many physicians in order to treat a single patient. In just a single visit, a patient may be observed and monitored by medical students, hospital residents and the primary physician or caretaker. The practice of having a large team of physicians looking after one patient is at the center of debate regarding teaching hospitals. Some patients are strongly opposed being observed numerous caretakers at once while others are in favor of having many individuals involved in their care.

Teaching hospitals are well known for treating rare diseases as well as extremely ill patients, but must do many additional common treatments in order to maintain income. It is often the amount of funding that determines a teaching hospital&#x27;s perceived quality of care. As the data used to compare quality of care is mainly observational, it is nearly impossible to compare the quality of care between teaching hospitals and non-teaching hospitals.

==In culture==
Teaching hospitals gained notoriety in the rise of the American &quot;medical drama&quot; genre of television. These are known to glorify the reality of teaching hospitals, using societal appeals in order to add dramatics. Medical dramas taking place in teaching hospitals are said to be medically inaccurate, simplified, and exaggerated, but they succeed in capturing the dedication of doctors and trainees.

Some popular examples of medical dramas that take place in teaching hospitals are &quot;St. Elsewhere, Chicago Hope, ER, Scrubs, House, Grey&#x27;s Anatomy and The Good Doctor.&quot;

<doc id="485701" wikidata="Q298419" url="?curid=485701" title="Sokollu Mehmed Pasha">
<text>Sokollu Mehmed Pasha (; ; ; 1505 – 11 October 1579) was an Ottoman statesman of Serb origin most notable for being the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire. Born in Ottoman Herzegovina into an Orthodox Christian family, Mehmed was recruited as a young boy as part of so called &quot;blood tax&quot; to serve as a janissary to the Ottoman devşirme system of recruiting Christian boys to be raised as officers or administrators for the state. He rose through the ranks of the Ottoman imperial system, eventually holding positions as commander of the imperial guard (1543–1546), High Admiral of the Fleet (1546–1551), Governor-General of Rumelia (1551–1555), Third Vizier (1555–1561), Second Vizier (1561–1565), and as Grand Vizier (1565–1579, for a total of 14 years, three months, 17 days) under three sultans: Suleiman the Magnificent, Selim II, and Murad III. He was assassinated in 1579, ending his near 15-years of service to several Sultans, as sole legal representative in the administration of state affairs.

Although Sokullu was Muslim, he remembered his Serbian Orthodox roots and his family. He persuaded the Sultan to restore the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć as a &quot;gesture of reconciliation&quot;. He appointed members of his family (both Muslim and Christian) to important positions in Ottoman Empire, including Sokollu Mustafa Pasha, Makarije Sokolović, Ferhad Pasha Sokolović, Sinan-beg Boljanić, Sokolluzade Lala Mehmed Pasha and Lala Mustafa Pasha.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Sokollu&#x27;s birth name was probably &quot;Bajica&quot;, and he was of ethnic Serb origin. He was said to be born into a modest shepherd family, adherent to the Serbian Orthodox Church, in or near Sokolovići (tr. &quot;Sokol&quot;) in the vicinity of modern-day Rudo. &quot;Sokollu&quot; is a demonym, derived from his place of birth, whereas the suffix &quot;-lu&quot; means &quot;from&quot; in Turkish. His father was named Dimitrije. He had two brothers and a sister, who married the older brother of Hüseyin Pasha Boljanić, as well as at least one uncle. However, details about his family and relations are disputed on two major counts. One is his relationship to Makarije Sokolović. Traditionally identified as his brother, today some historians consider him to have been either a nephew or distant relative. The second is the matter of Mehmed&#x27;s uncle. By some accounts, his uncle was a monk at the Mileševa monastery who had his two nephews, Bajica and Makarije (taken to be brothers according to this view), educated there. Other sources suggest that his uncle converted to Islam early.

Though Sokollu had embraced Islam, he remembered his family and Serbian Orthodox roots. He would appoint his relatives (both Muslim and Christian) to important positions, including Sokollu Mustafa Pasha, Makarije Sokolović, Ferhad Pasha Sokolović, Sinan-beg Boljanić, Sokolluzade Lala Mehmed Pasha and Lala Mustafa Pasha.

===Janissary education===
He was renamed Mehmed and, first in Edirne and then in Constantinople, received a thorough Ottoman indoctrination as a recruit, first as an apprentice Janissary (in Turkish &quot;Acemi Oğlan&quot;); then in the &quot;Enderun&quot; or palace school in Topkapı Palace.

As proclaimed in Baghdad on 13 March 1535, Mehmed was sent to be one of the seven retainers of the Imperial Treasurer Iskender Çelebi. Upon Iskender&#x27;s death, Mehmed returned to Constantinople. In addition to Turkish, he spoke Serbian, Persian, Arabic, Venetian-Italian and Latin language.

===Early career===
Mehmed in 1541 first became an Imperial Chamberlain and then the head of the Sultan&#x27;s squires. In these positions he became very close to Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and learned from him.

As a soldier, Mehmed excelled at the Battle of Mohács and the first Siege of Vienna. In 1546 the Kapudan Pasha Hayreddin Barbarossa died and Mehmed was appointed his successor. In this capacity he was present at the naval expedition against Trablus (present-day Tripoli in Libya). During his five years in this position, Mehmed Pasha greatly strengthened the arsenal of the naval fleet.

Mehmed became &quot;Beylerbey&quot; (Governor-General) of Rumelia in 1551, headquartered in Sofia. While he was visiting the area of his birth, his mother recognized him by the birthmark on his face and embraced her child for the first time in more than thirty years.

After the death of John Zápolya, king of Hungary as an Ottoman vassal, in 1540, Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor looked to annex Zápolya&#x27;s lands (the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom). The Hungarian diet had elected infant John Sigismund Zápolya, the son of Zápolya and Isabella Jagiellon, as King of Hungary, which broke the Treaty of Nagyvárad, and Ferdinand I invaded Hungary. Queen Isabella struggled to rule Hungary for her son. Frater George Martinuzzi, appointed by John as regent, opposed her (he would later be created a Cardinal as reward for his accomplishments in this conflict). Ferdinand I sent mercenary leader (&quot;condottiero&quot;) Bartolomeo Castoldo with more than 7,000 mercenaries who beat a contingent led by Péter Petrovics, killing more than 2,500 of them, near Csanád. The Sultan immediately ordered Sokollu Mehmed Pasha to move into Hungary, so he assembled an army of 90,000 soldiers and fifty-four cannons and also summoned the pashas of Smederevo, Vidin and Nicopolis. When his forces reached Slankamen in Syrmia, George Martinuzzi begged Mehmed not to attack Transylvania, arguing that it had remained in the possession of the Sultan. Mehmed rejected negotiation proposals, led Ottoman forces into Transylvania and soon captured 16 cities, including Bečej, Becskerek, Csanád and Lippa. In this campaign, Sokollu won over to his side local Serb-manned garrisons by pointing out to his common ethnicity with them. Martinuzzi responded by raising a rebellion in Transylvania, mustering one soldier from every household. Mehmed had to fall back and once again laid siege to Temesvár on 14 October with the main part of his army and 50 cannons. Mehmed demanded surrender, but the city&#x27;s commander, István Losonci, replied with a recommendation for Mehmed&#x27;s return to Rumelia.

Mehmed besieged the city until 28 October but could not seize it. Retreating to Belgrade, he initiated peace negotiations with the Monk-Viceroy. Martinuzzi was assassinated on 17 December 1551, and peace talks ended. Sokollu Mehmed renewed his military campaign in 1552, seizing Temesvár (see Siege of Temesvár (1552)), Hollókő, Buják, Rétság, Balassagyarmat, the whole of Banat and Szolnok. Sokollu Mehmed&#x27;s forces then joined with those of Ahmet Pasha advancing towards Eger. Mehmed&#x27;s army assembled on the Hill of Egid but could not take the city itself.

In 1532, Sultan Suleiman had declared war on Safavid Persia following two decades of peace after the climactic Battle of Chaldiran, when the Persian Shah Tahmasp wanted to take advantage of the Sultan&#x27;s preoccupation with Hungary and started making armed incursions into Ottoman territory. Sokollu Mehmed was dispatched to spend the winter of 1553/1554 in Tokat to take charge of the final stages of the war against Persia. In June 1554, Mehmed Pasha and the Rumelian troops joined the Sultan&#x27;s army and took part in the Safavid Campaign (1554–55).

===Vizier===

====Third Vizier====
Impressed by Sokollu Mehmed&#x27;s skills, the Sultan made him the Third Vizier in 1555 and he was given a place in the Imperial Council (&quot;Divan&quot;). His position as Governor-General of Rumelia was given to a Herzegovinian Janissary &quot;agha&quot;, Pertev Pasha, an old companion of Mehmed&#x27;s from when they had both served under Iskender Çelebi.

Almost immediately Sokollu Mehmed had to quell a rebellion around Salonica, led by Mustafa Bey, who pretended to be the Sultan&#x27;s late son Mustafa. Sokollu Mehmed took 4,000 horsemen and 3,000 janissaries and quelled the rebellion. Mustafa Bey was hanged.

Mehmed&#x27;s brother, Topuzli-Makarije, became a monk of the Serb Chilandar Monastery on Mount Athos. Makarije Sokolović paid a visit to his brother&#x27;s palace in Constantinople in 1557, where the two brothers discussed the possibility of re-establishing the autocephaly of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Later that same year, Sokollu Mehmed issued an edict (&quot;firman&quot;) declaring the restoration of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć, with Makarije Sokolović as Serbian Patriarch Makarije I. The edict also guaranteed the rights and religious freedom of all inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire.

When the former Grand Vizier Ahmet Pasha was deposed and hanged, he was replaced by Rüstem Pasha, who had numerous enemies. One of them was Lala Mustafa, who instigated the Sultan&#x27;s third son, Bayezid, then &quot;Beylerbey&quot; of Karaman, to raise a rebellion against his brother and heir-apparent Selim. Sokollu Mehmed mustered an army and went to Konya, where he decisively defeated Bayezid&#x27;s forces in May 1559. Bayezid fled to Persia. Sokollu Mehmed remained in Asia and spent the winter negotiating with the Persian Shah regarding Bayezid&#x27;s extradition. After long negotiations, the Shah handed over Bayezid and his four sons, who were subsequently executed.

====Second Vizier====
In 1561, Grand Vizier Rüstem Pasha died and was succeeded by the Second Vizier, Semiz Ali Pasha. Sokollu Mehmed Pasha in turn became Second Vizier, while Pertev Pasha became Third Vizier.

On 17 August 1562, Sokollu Mehmed married Sultan Suleiman&#x27;s granddaughter – Prince Selim&#x27;s daughter – Ismihan Sultan (some sources read her name as Esma Han Sultan) . Mehmed spent the following years in peace, governing and administering the realm.

In 1563, Mehmed&#x27;s nephew, Sokollu Mustafa Bey, became sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Bosnia.

===Grand Vizier===
In June 1565, Grand Vizier Semiz Ali Pasha died. Sultan Suleiman had much confidence in Sokollu Mehmed Pasha and promoted him to this position.

====War with the Habsburgs====
In late 1565 and early 1566, tensions between the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II and Sultan Suleiman grew. Maximilian wanted the cities previously taken by Telli Hasan Pasha restored to him. When negotiations failed, Maximilian declared war and Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha ordered his nephew, Sokollu Mustafa Bey of Bosnia, to advance against Maximilian. Sokollu Mustafa managed to capture the cities of Krupa and Dvor na Uni. The Sultan immediately declared war against the Holy Roman Empire, and Sokollu Mehmed began the preparations for the army&#x27;s advance. The Grand Vizier went ahead, preparing for the arrival of the Sultan, who was leading the main part of the Ottoman forces. After 50 days, they arrived in Belgrade.

Passing through Zemun, one part of the army crossed Varaždin and struck Egar before proceeding towards Vienna. Nikola Šubić Zrinski (Miklós Zrínyi) had defeated the &quot;sanjakbey&quot; Tirhal Mohammed, executing him and his son, and capturing 17,000 ducats. This incurred the Sultan&#x27;s wrath, and he dispatched Sokollu Mehmed&#x27;s forces to besiege Szigetvár, while Suleiman remained in Harsang. The commander of Budin, Arslan Pasha, lost the cities of Várpalota, Veszprém and Tata. The Sultan sent a platoon of fifteen troopers to bring him Arslan Pasha&#x27;s head, but Arslan had already left his forces three days earlier and was on his way to the Sultan. The Sultan showed Sokollu Mehmed a letter in which Arslan had insulted him, and on 3 August, when Arslan reported to Mehmed&#x27;s tent with 15 heavily armed horsemen, Sokollu Mehmed criticized Arslan for his conduct, accused him of treason and stripped him of his post, giving it instead to his nephew Sokollu Mustafa.

The Sultan arrived with Sokollu Mehmed&#x27;s sons, Kurt Bey and Hasan Bey, at Pécs. Finally, the large Ottoman force, which numbered between 100,000 and 300,000 soldiers and 300 cannons, laid siege to Szigetvár. The Battle of Szigetvár was an Ottoman victory, with heavy losses on both sides. Both commanders died during the battle: while Zrinsky was killed in the final charge, Suleiman the Magnificent died in his tent from natural causes, before the Turks achieved victory. According to Robert William Fraser, more than 10,000 large cannonballs where shot into the fortress during the siege.

Sokollu Mehmed Pasha had all witnesses to the Sultan&#x27;s death executed, and announced that Suleiman was too sick to perform his duties and that he would be healing in Szigetvár, while he would be acting on the Sultan&#x27;s behalf. Sokollu Mehmed rewarded those involved in the capture of Szigetvár and increased the soldiers&#x27; wages. He sent a part of the army to capture Babócsa. The Tartars, however, spread the news of the Sultan&#x27;s death, and Sokollu Mustafa Bey wrote to Prince Selim about his father&#x27;s death. Selim marched immediately towards Srem. Upon his arrival in Vukovar, Sokollu Mehmed wrote him that it would be best if he went to Belgrade to greet his army for a more formal and effective take-over of the Empire. Selim returned to Belgrade, and Mehmed ordered the army to march towards the town. Forty days after the Sultan&#x27;s death, in October 1566, the army set out for Belgrade. At the fourth stop on the way to Belgrade, forty-eight days after Suleiman&#x27;s death, Sokollu Mehmed announced the Sultan&#x27;s death ceremonially, during the traditional reading of the Koran. Sokollu Mehmed had Suleiman&#x27;s body embalmed and ordered the army to proceed to meet the new Sultan in Belgrade. After three marches, the army arrived in Sremska Mitrovica. Mehmed reminded Selim to send gifts to the viziers, pashas and the army, but Selim&#x27;s advisors convinced the new Sultan not to do so. Sokollu Mehmed went to Belgrade and swore allegiance to Selim II as his Sultan, and Selim confirmed him as his Grand Vizier.

Expecting a mutiny among the military in the capital, Sokollu Mehmed had Suleiman&#x27;s body sent to Constantinople to restore order amongst the janissaries and other officials, who now demanded more compensation for their past efforts. In Belgrade, Sultan Selim II called a council, as even some of his closest officials were openly mocking him. Sokollu Mehmed assured him that he would manage everything effectively, and distributed gifts to the troops, rewarding them handsomely to regain their loyalty.

On the fifth day of their stay in Belgrade, the Sultan, Sokollu Mehmed and the army departed for Constantinople. Before they managed to return to the Empire&#x27;s capital, a mutiny broke out and the road to the city was blocked, and Sokollu Mehmed and Ahmed Pasha had to bribe their way into the city. Order was restored after Sokollu Mehmed convinced the Sultan to promise to send handsome gifts and higher wages to the janissaries. The next morning, each janissary was given standard pay of 40 ducats and an additional 20 ducats as an accession bonus. Soon, the other branches of the military, the sipahis and mercenaries, demanded higher wages as well. Mehmed arrested and replaced their &quot;aghas&quot; at once, finally stopping all dissent.

Two years after Selim&#x27;s accession, on 17 February 1568, Sokollu Mehmed succeeded in concluding at Edirne a peace treaty with Emperor Maximilian II, whereby the Emperor agreed to pay an annual &quot;honorary present&quot; of 30,000 ducats.

====Expedition to Sumatra====
One of Sokollu&#x27;s greatest responsibilities was planning an Ottoman invasion of Sumatra in 1567. Historical records from the time show that Sokollu played an active role in the strategic execution of the invasion and that he was extremely detailed in the logistics. Later on, Sokollu would also participate in the expedition as a commander. According to these historical records, between November and December 1567 Sokollu and his expedition took sail to Aceh with fifteen fully armed war galleys and two transport galleys. Upon a seemingly friendly arrival to Aceh, the sultan of Sumatra requested that all the members of the expedition follow his orders. The sultan later offered his loyalty to the Ottoman Empire and forged a bond of mutual understanding between Istanbul and Aceh.

====Expedition to Yemen====
Immediately after the expedition to Sumatra, the Ottoman Empire suffered a major rebellion from one of their most important settlements. An uprising led by Zaydi Imam in Yemen created substantial uncertainty in the region which Sokollu had to give imminent priority before taking any further action in Aceh. While the insurrection in Yemen started in the summer of 1567, it was not taking seriously by the Ottoman regime until later in the year, when most of the major cities in the region came under fire by the rebellious factions. It is believed that the cause of the dissatisfaction in Yemen was the intensified Ottoman involvement in the region as a prelude for an expansion in the Indian Ocean. The unhappiness in the Ottoman Yemen also went back to the rule of Governor Mahmud Pasha, a compatriot of Sokollu, who managed to produce large economic gains in the region at the expense of the wellbeing of the population. After Mahmud&#x27;s wrongdoings in Yemen had been revealed, Sokollu decided to appoint Koja Sinan, who was assigned the responsibilities to appease the turmoils in Yemen.

====Suez Canal====
Although the rebellions in Yemen once again forced Sokollu to postpone any further military action in Sumatra and the Indian Ocean, it also opened the possibility to promote one of his favorite projects: and attempt to build a canal from the Mediterranean to Suez. He instructed the governor of Egypt to send architects engineers to assess the possibility of this canal, with the purpose of allowing a better connection from Muslims attempting to visit the Holy Cities. Sokollu also was concerned about Muslims from the northeast, Crimea and Anatolia, who had to cross the Black Sea in order to visit the Holy Cities. Thus, he took actions for the construction of an open canal between the Don and the Volga in the north.

====Wars with Russia, Venice and the Holy League====
Mehmed Pasha had little success against Russia, and the first encounter between the Ottoman Empire and her future northern rival presaged the disaster to come. A plan had been devised at Constantinople for connecting the Volga and Don by a canal, and in the summer of 1569 a large force of janissaries and cavalry was sent to lay siege to Astrakhan and begin the canal works, while an Ottoman fleet besieged Azov. However, a sortie of the garrison of Astrakhan drove back the besiegers. A Russian army of 15,000 men attacked and scattered the workmen and the Tatar force sent for their protection, and the Ottoman fleet was destroyed by a storm. Early in 1570 the ambassadors of Ivan the Terrible concluded at Constantinople a treaty which restored friendly relations between the Sultan and the Tsar.

Although the government was weakening, Sokollu Mehmed Paşa managed to expand the borders of the Ottoman Empire greatly. In 1570 he dispatched Sinan Pasha to conquer Arabia. Sinan Pasha solemnly declared the reign of Sultan Selim II in Mecca upon finishing his military campaign in Hejaz and Yemen.

In 1571–1572, on the order Mehmed&#x27;s wife Ismihan Sultan (or Esma Han Sultan), the famous architect Mimar Sinan built the Sokollu Mehmed Paşa Mosque, which an authoritative guide to Constantinople states to be &quot;The most beautiful of the smaller mosques in Istanbul, a minor masterpiece by Sinan&quot;.

During the rule of Sokollu Mehmed Pasha as Grand Vizier, the Ottoman navy and army took Cyprus in 1571 from Venice. The administration of Cyprus was given to Mehmed&#x27;s old friend, the Arab Ahmed Pasha. The invasion of Cyprus led to the formation of a so-called Holy League, comprising the Pope, Spain with Naples and Sicily, the Republic of Venice, Genoa, Tuscany, and the Knights of Malta. On 7 October 1571, the coalition&#x27;s fleet under the command of Don Juan of Austria decisively defeated the Ottoman fleet under Müezzinzade Ali Pasha in the Battle of Lepanto.

Sokollu Mehmed Pasha immediately ensured that Piyale Pasha and Uluç Ali Reis, the new Grand Admiral, were provided with all the necessary means and resources to rebuild the Empire&#x27;s shattered fleet. By July 1572 the Ottoman fleet already numbered 250 fully equipped warships &quot;including eight of the largest capital ships ever seen in the Mediterranean&quot;. It is reported in Turkish chronicles that Sokollu Mehmed Pasha had said to the Venetian Ambassador &quot;By conquering Cyprus we have cut off one of your arms; at Lepanto by defeating our navy you have only shaved off our beard. However, you know that a cut-off arm cannot be replaced but shaved-off beard grows thicker.&quot; Indeed, the Holy League ships had to retire to ports and Ottoman naval supremacy in the Mediterranean was restored. The new Ottoman Navy that started a naval expedition in summer of 1573 under Uluç Ali Reis found no rivals in the Mediterranean and ravaged the coasts of Sicily and southern Italy and in 1574 it captured Tunis from the Hafsids, who for some time had been supported by Spanish troops, thus restoring Ottoman domination in the Western Mediterranean.

On 3 March 1573, the Venetian Republic signed a new peace treaty with the Ottomans under Mehmed Pasha, thereby bringing the Holy League to an end, accepting the loss of Cyprus and increasing the tribute payments. He also extended for eight more years the peace treaty with the Holy Roman Empire and maintained good relations with France, Poland-Lithuania and Russia. He was preparing for a fresh attack on Venice when the Sultan&#x27;s death on 12 December 1574 cut short his plans.

====Final years====
Sokollu Mehmed Pasha&#x27;s wealth reached its peak around 1573, when the value of his personal property (cash, goods, accounts, objects) amounted to 18 million ducats. Mehmed received the standard Grand Vizier&#x27;s wage of 20 ducats every day. His wealth increased greatly through gifts and taxes of Ottoman officials: anyone who became a vizier had to pay Mehmed Pasha 50,000-60,000 ducats, and every Governor-General had to pay 15,000-20,000 or even sometimes 30,000-40,000 ducats upon ascending to the office. The provincial governor of Egypt at Cairo alone dispatched 100,000 ducats to the Grand Vizier every year.

On 30 August 1574, Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha installed his nephew Antonije Sokolović, then the Metropolitan of Hum, as the new Eastern Orthodox Archbishop of Ohrid. On 23 October the same year, upon the death of Patriarch Makarije, Antonije became the new Serbian Patriarch. Antonije died soon, in 1575, and was replaced by yet another one of Mehmed&#x27;s nephews, Gerasim Sokolović.

When Sultan Selim II died, Sokollu Mehmed Pasha again kept this secret until Selim&#x27;s oldest son Murad arrived from his governor&#x27;s post in Manisa. Sokollu Mehmed Pasha acknowledged the new Sultan, Murad III, and remained Grand Vizier, but now he had to cope with the rising political influence of the palace women, first with Sultan&#x27;s mother Nurbanu Sultan and then his wife, of Albanian origin, Safiye Sultan. Murad III gradually soured on Sokollu Mehmed&#x27;s overwhelming power within the Empire, and the Grand Vizier&#x27;s influence declined.

Sokollu Mehmed Pasha was involved in the succession disputes of the Polish Crown in 1576 and 1577, but this did not reach greater measures.

Sokollu Mehmed signed numerous treaties of friendship with Venice, Florence, Spain, England and Switzerland. He also managed to force a number of European states to pay tribute: Austria paid 9,000 ducats; Transylvania 3,000; Wallachia 7,000; Moldavia 3,000. Eventually, even Venice had to pay him 4,000 ducats annually. This altogether gave him an annual income of 31,000 gold ducats.

Mehmed was initially known to be opposed to the war with Persia, which began in 1578, but was overruled upon eventually, amongst the reasons being the constant urgings by Sokollu Mehmed to take advantage of the Ottomans neighboring rival. Sultan Murad III time afterwards, began to limit his Grand Vizier&#x27;s powers by slowly removing his allies from high offices. The state secretary Feridun, an old companion of Sokollu mehmed&#x27;s since the siege of Szigetvár, was sent to Belgrade, away from Constantinople. Mehmed&#x27;s faithful Arab friend, the Governor-General of Cyprus, was lynched by mutinous soldiers. Mehmed&#x27;s greatest rivals, Hamid Efendi and Piyale Pasha, arranged the execution of the Grand Vizier&#x27;s Greek protege, Michael Kantakouzenos. On 10 October 1578, Sokollu Mustafa Pasha, Sokollu Mehmed Pasha&#x27;s nephew and beylerbey (governor-general) of Budin, was assassinated (some sources put it as September 30, 1578). On the anniversary of this day, on 10 October 1579, Sokollu Mehmed had his servant Hasan Bey read to him about the Battle of Kosovo.

==Death==
On 11 October 1579, Sokollu Mehmed Pasha was assassinated. Ending his near 15-year rule serving as the sultan sole legal representative in the administration of state affairs. There are some who claim that the assassin was a janissary in disguise in employment of Safiye Sultan, the wife of Murad III. Also, some sources claim that Sokollu Mehmed was a target of Hashshashin agent, as he was opposed to war with Persia where this order was stationed, which was not in their interest, although this is a very controversial claim as this order was destroyed by Mongols long time before. In 1579, he was succeeded as grand vizier by Semiz Ahmed Pasha.

He is buried at his complex, &quot;Sokollu Mehmed Paşa Külliyesi&quot; at the back of Eyüp Mosque, in Istanbul, at the &quot;Sokollu Mehmed Paşa Türbe&quot; built by famous architect Mimar Sinan for him c. 1572. His wife Ismihan (or Esma Han) is buried near him and in the little garden of the Türbe are buried the family and descendants of Sokollu Mehmed Pasha.

===Aftermath===
After his death Sultan Murad III changed grand viziers ten times in sixteen years. These frequent changes in government were part of the general instability in the Ottoman government that followed the death of Sokollu Mehmet Pasha, evidence of a decline in the empire that he had at its pinnacle while he was in office.

==Heritage and legacy==
Sokollu Mehmed Pasha has left numerous architecturally well known buildings in Constantinople and throughout Ottoman territories. Foundations of his buildings are spread over Edirne, Halep, Medina, Bečkerek, Belgrade and alongside Bosnia, where he is especially remembered for his bridges. Mecca and Constantinople alone contained a number of his mosques.

The Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque and the complex built at Kadirga district of İstanbul by architect Mimar Sinan is considered to be the most beautiful of the smaller mosques in İstanbul. It is known for its unusually fine ordering of medrese over the entry stairs, its lofty elegant interior, the first hooded fountain, ogival arches of the arcades, and especially, the fine and well preserved Iznik tiles.

His most renowned endowment is the eleven-arched Višegrad bridge in his hometown of Višegrad. The construction and history of the bridge is the topic of the novel &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot; (Serbian: &quot;Na Drini ćuprija - На Дрини ћуприја&quot;), written by Nobel laureate Ivo Andrić, a Yugoslav novelist His life also interested the Yugoslav writer Meša Selimović. There were numerous Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian legends about the bridge&#x27;s construction. According to one, Mehmed Paşa built the bridge in his son&#x27;s name. Another is the tale of its architect Rade, which is described in &quot;Bridge on the Drina&quot;.

Sokollu Mehmed Pasha is often credited as the mastermind of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s last great push into the Indian Ocean. Aside from his political achievements, Sokollu was also very interested in the arts and sciences, which led to several important contributions. For example, he often funded paintings by renowned Veronese artists as well as imported glassware from Italian artisans. He also worked together with prominent Ottoman geographers and historians of his time, including Feridun Ahmed Beg, Sipahazade Mahmed, and Kutbeddin Mekki.

Other elements of his architectural legacy include:

*The &quot;Azapkapi Mosque&quot;, built by Sinan in 1577–1578 in the Azapkapi district of İstanbul, is considered most important Ottoman monument in Galata.

*A mosque, maktab and musafirhana (guest house) in his native village of Sokolovići

==Issue==
On 17 August 1562, Sokollu Mehmed Pasha married Ismihan Sultan, daughter of future Sultan Selim II and Nurbanu Sultan and granddaughter of Sultan Süleyman I and Haseki Hürrem Sultan. 

They had a daughter and three sons:
*Safiye Hanımsultan (1563 - ?). She was firstly married to her father&#x27;s cousin Sokollu Mustafa Pasha, governor of Budin. After his execution in 1578, she married the new governor of Budin Silahdar Cafer Pasha. After his death in 1587, she had posthumous twin sons Mehmed Bey and Cafer Bey, who died as children. She married thirdly to Sultanzade Abdülbaki Bey, son of her mother&#x27;s cousin Hümaşah Sultan.
*Sultanzade Ahmed Bey (1564 - 1567). Died in infancy, probably of smallpox.

*Sultanzade Piri Mehmed Bey (1566 - 1567). Died in early infancy, probably of smallpox.

==Personal life==
Mehmed spent the following years in peace, governing and administrating the realm. Mehmed&#x27;s nephew, Sokollu Mustafa Pasha, was also a prominent politician, was sanjakbey of Bosnia and later the longest-serving governor of Budin Eyalet. It is said that Sokollu learned many lessons and refined his expansionist strategies under the influence of Seydi Reis. One of the most important pieces of knowledge that was passed on to Sokollu was that the Ottoman Empire was an all-time high across the region.

<doc id="485710" wikidata="Q259318" url="?curid=485710" title="Vitex agnus-castus">
<text>Vitex agnus-castus (also called vitex, chaste tree / chastetree, chasteberry, Abraham&#x27;s balm, lilac chastetree, or monk&#x27;s pepper) is a plant native of the Mediterranean region. It is one of the few temperate-zone species of &quot;Vitex&quot;, which is on the whole a genus of tropical and subtropical flowering plants. Vitex is a cross-pollinating plant, but its self-pollination has been recorded.

Theophrastus mentioned the shrub several times, as &quot;agnos&quot; (ἄγνος) in &quot;Enquiry into Plants&quot;. It has been long believed to be an anaphrodisiac – leading to its name as &quot;chaste tree&quot; – but its effectiveness for such action remains unproven. The shrub was utilized for religious rituals in ancient Greece and among the Philistines in modern-day Palestine.

==Etymology and common names==
&quot;Vitex&quot;, its name in Pliny the Elder, is derived from the Latin &quot;vieo&quot;, meaning to weave or to tie up, a reference to the use of &quot;V. agnus-castus&quot; in basketry. Its macaronic specific name &quot;agnus-castus&quot; repeats &quot;chaste&quot; in both Greek and Latin; the small tree was considered to be sacred to the virginal goddess Hestia/Vesta. The most common names are &quot;chaste tree&quot;, &quot;vitex&quot;, and &quot;monk&#x27;s pepper&quot;.

==Description==

&quot;Vitex agnus-castus&quot; is widely cultivated in warm, temperate, and subtropical regions for its delicately textured, aromatic foliage and butterfly-attracting midsummer spikes of lavender flowers opening in late summer in cooler climates. It grows to a height of . It requires full sun, though tolerates partial shade, along with well-draining soil. Under ideal conditions, it is hardy to USDA Zone 6. In colder zones, the plant tends to die back to the ground, but as it flowers on new wood, flowering is not affected on vigorous growth in the following season. This plant is a brackish water dweller, indicating that it tolerates salt. Cold and wet weather results in dieback and losses. The plant grows well on loamy, neutral to alkaline soil.

In cultivation in the UK, the form &quot;V. agnus-castus&quot; f. &quot;latifolia&quot; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

The fruits from one single tree can be harvested for more than 15 years. This indicates that the tree cannot be integrated in a usual crop rotation system. It is suggested to sow dissimilar plants such as monocots as its subsequent crop so that it might be easier to control the monk&#x27;s pepper plant, the dicot. Because the fruits of monk&#x27;s pepper tend to fall constantly and uncontrollably, the plant likely can germinate from seed. The overall best yield per hectare reportedly can be achieved if the plant spacing is around . Pruning back the branches in autumn has a positive influence on fruit yield while repruning in spring can induce an increase of vegetative shoots, thus a fruit yield loss.

===Reproduction===

This plant can also be reproduced vegetatively. One possibility is to use pieces of the ripening wood with buds in July or August and another is to cut the ripe wood in November and then let it root in a coldframe. Also &quot;in vitro&quot; reproduction with spike of the shoots or node explants is possible.

===Harvest===
The flowering and ripening processes do not happen simultaneously, enabling harvesting of both fresh fruits and seeds over a long span of time. The fruits tend to fall from the plant as they ripen, getting lost in the soil. Thus, it has no optimal fixed harvest time. Consequently, to avoid yield loss, unripe fruits need to be harvested. This early harvesting has no effect on quality. Overall, harvesting the fruits by hand likely is the most convenient solution.

===Diseases and pests===
Thysanoptera, also known as thrips, can cause great damage to the growth and the generative development of &quot;V. agnus-castus&quot;. The insect feeds on chaste tree by sucking up the fruit contents or puncturing them. Also, chaste tree is the only known host (especially in Israel) for &quot;Hyalesthes obsoletus&quot;. This cicada is the vector for black wood disease of grapevines. &quot;H. obsoletus&quot; prefers &quot;V. agnus-castus&quot; as a host to the grapevine. In this case, chaste trees can be used as a biological control agent by planting them around vineyards to trap the &quot;H. obsoletus&quot;.
&quot;V. agnus-castus&quot; was found not only to be an appropriate food source for the adult vectors, but also a reservoir of &quot;Candidatus phytoplasma solani&quot; (bacterial &quot;Phytoplasma&quot; species), the causal agent of the black wood disease in grapevines. 
The pathogen-caused leaf spot disease can almost defoliate &quot;V. agnus castus&quot;. Furthermore, root rot can occur when soils are kept too moist.

==Chemical compounds==
Flavonoids (vitexin, casticin), iridoid glycoside (agnuside, aucubin), p-hydroxybenzoic acid, alkaloids, essential oils, fatty oils, diterpenoids and steroids have been identified in the chemical analysis of &quot;V. agnus-castus&quot;. They occur in the fruits and in the leaves.

===Essential oils===
Essential oils have been found in the fruits and in the leaves. The oil of leaves, unripe, and ripe fruits differ in compounds; 50 compounds were identified in the oil of unripe fruits, 51 compounds in the oil of ripe fruits, and 46 compounds in the oil of the leaves. 1,8-Cineole and sabinene are the main monoterpene components and beta-caryophyllene is the major sesquiterpene compound found in the fruits of &quot;V. agnus-castus&quot;. Some slight differences occur between fruits from white-flowering plants compared to violet-flowering ones. The oil of fruits of former has a higher amount of monoterpene constituents. The leaves mainly contain 1,8-cineole, trans-beta-farnesene, alpha-pinene, trans-beta-caryophyllene, and terpinen-4-ol. The oil, particularly from white-flowering plants, is under preliminary research for its potential antibacterial effects.

==Uses==
===Medicinal and culinary use===
The chaste tree, a local shrub known since the Lower Paleolithic for various applications including as a spice, was also historically valued for its medicinal properties, including uses as anaphrodisiac and abortifacient, with further properties suggested by modern studies. The shrub has been used by several ancient Mediterranean cultures.

&quot;Vitex&quot; has been used in traditional medicine for reproductive health issues in women, but only limited high-quality clinical evidence supports its effectiveness. Although it is commonly recommended in Germany, &quot;V. agnus-castus&quot; should be avoided during pregnancy due to the possibility of complications.

===Religious use===
In ancient Greece, the chaste tree played a significant role in the female agricultural festival of Thesmophoria, dedicated to honoring the goddesses Demeter and Persephone in Greek cities. In Archaic Sparta, in the 8th–6th centuries BCE, it was incorporated into the cult of the local agriculture goddess, Artemis Orthia. The first century physician Dioscorides documented various synonyms for the lilac chaste tree. In the second century CE, Pausanias mentioned that the wooden image of Asclepius in Sparta was crafted from the chaste tree. Additionally, there is botanical and textual evidence supporting the significance of the chaste tree at the Heraion of Samos during the 6th–3rd centuries BCE.

In a Philistine temple at Gath, an excavation uncovered around 100 chaste tree fruits, a find unparalleled in both quantity and context compared to other locations in Israel. This suggests their deliberate use in religious practices, possibly in celebration of a goddess related to Hera.

Notably, the chaste tree is linked to the binding of Hera, where it featured in rituals celebrating her mythology at Samos.

==Safety and adverse effects==
Adverse effects from &quot;Vitex&quot; can include nausea, headache, gastrointestinal discomfort, menstrual discomfort, fatigue, and skin disorders. People taking dopamine-related medications or Parkinson&#x27;s disease medications should avoid using chasteberry. Women on birth-control pills, hormone-replacement therapy, or having a hormone-sensitive condition, such as breast cancer, are advised not to use chasteberry. Use of &quot;Vitex&quot; is discouraged for pregnant or breastfeeding women, and for children.

<text>Herb Dickieson (born March 8, 1954) is a retired physician and a former educator and politician in Prince Edward Island, Canada. Dickieson was the first and, to date, only member of the New Democratic Party of Prince Edward Island to have sat in the Legislative Assembly. He currently serves as the President of the PEI NDP.

Dickieson was raised in New Glasgow on a small family farm. He graduated from the University of Prince Edward Island with his B.Sc. in 1979 and received a B.Ed. in 1982. Dickieson taught high school in Calgary, Alberta for one year before entering medical school at Dalhousie University, from which he graduated with his medical degree in 1987. Dickieson interned in New Brunswick and in Prince Edward Island and established a family medicine practise in O&#x27;Leary.

Dickieson was elected leader of the Island New Democrats in March 1995, and led the party in the 1996 and 2000 provincial elections, seeking to be a Member of the Legislature for District 25, West Point-Bloomfield. He was successful in the 1996 election, but was defeated in the 2000 election. Dickieson led the party through the 1990s, but resigned two years after his personal electoral defeat.

Dickieson was a popular politician during his term, even among non-New Democrats, as a voice for change. He was encouraged by many members to run for the federal New Democratic Party in the 2004 federal election and again provincially, he had refused until he announced on September 12, 2014 that he would seek the NDP nomination for Egmont for the 2015 federal election. Dickieson was nominated as the candidate in October 2014. On October 19, 2015, Dickieson was defeated in the election, finishing third behind the winner, Liberal Bobby Morrissey and Conservative incumbent Gail Shea.

Dickieson was involved in local and provincial issues, including concern over the closing of rural post offices, the fate of farmers, and the quality of education, particularly among children. He has served on boards for the promotion of a community youth centre, Chamber of Commerce board of directors, and as Chief of Medical Staff at the Community Hospital in O&#x27;Leary. He is also a Past President of the Medical Society of Prince Edward Island.

He resides with his wife Kathleen and family in Howlan.

He was elected President of the PEI NDP on November 12, 2023.

<text>Pinchas Zukerman (, born 16 July 1948) is an Israeli-American violinist, violist and conductor.

==Life and career==

Zukerman was born in Tel Aviv, to Jewish parents and Holocaust survivors Yehuda and Miriam Lieberman Zukerman. He began his musical studies at age four, on the recorder. His father then taught him to play the clarinet and then the violin at age eight. Early studies were at the Samuel Rubin Academy of Music (now the Buchmann-Mehta School of Music). Isaac Stern and Pablo Casals learned of Zukerman&#x27;s violin talent during a 1962 visit to Israel. Later that year, Zukerman moved to the United States to study at the Juilliard School under Stern and Ivan Galamian. He made his New York City performance debut in 1963. In 1967, he shared the Leventritt Prize with Korean violinist Kyung-wha Chung. His 1969 debut recordings—of the concerti by Tchaikovsky (with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Antal Dorati) and Mendelssohn (with the New York Philharmonic conducted by Leonard Bernstein)—launched a successful recording career of over 110 releases.

Zukerman launched his conducting career in 1970 with the English Chamber Orchestra, and served as director of London&#x27;s South Bank Festival from 1971 to 1974. In the US, Zukerman was music director of the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra from 1980 to 1987. He later directed the summer festivals of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra (1991–95) and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra (1996–99). In 1999, he became Music Director of Canada&#x27;s National Arts Centre Orchestra (NACO) in Ottawa, stepping down from the post in 2015. He has served as Principal Guest Conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra since 2009.

Zukerman is on the faculty at the Manhattan School of Music and is the leader and founder of the Zukerman Performance Program at the school. His former students include Koh Gabriel Kameda, Julian Rachlin, and Guy Braunstein. In 1999 he founded the National Arts Centre Young Artists Programme, which counts young musicians such as Viviane Hagner, Jessica Linnebach, and Antal Szalai as alumni. In 2006 Zukerman began his involvement in the Rolex Artistic Mentorship programme.

Zukerman plays the &quot;Dushkin&quot; Guarneri del Gesù violin of 1742. His honors include the King Solomon Award, the National Medal of Arts (presented by President Reagan in 1983), the Isaac Stern Award for Artistic Excellence, and an honorary doctorate from Brown University.

==Personal life==
Zukerman married Eugenia Rich in 1968. The couple had two daughters together, opera singer Arianna Zukerman and blues and folk musician Natalia Zukerman. Zukerman and Eugenia frequently performed together until their separation in 1983. Zukerman was married to actress Tuesday Weld from 1985 to 2001. He and Weld owned homes in Santa Fe, New Mexico and Montauk, New York, which they bought after the murder-suicide of its previous owners, soap opera actress Gwyda Donhowe and Broadway producer Norman Kean. Zukerman and his third wife, cellist Amanda Forsyth, have been married since 2004 and primarily reside in Manhattan. They often perform together.

==Recordings==
His recordings have received 21 Grammy nominations, and two Grammy wins. He has collaborated with filmmaker Christopher Nupen on several projects, and was the subject of Nupen&#x27;s &quot;Pinchas Zukerman: Here to Make Music&quot; documentary of 1974. In 2003 he founded a string quintet, the Zukerman Chamber Players, which has released three CD recordings in addition to its roster of live performances.

<doc id="485727" wikidata="Q3389348" url="?curid=485727" title="Pitohui">
<text>The pitohuis are bird species endemic to New Guinea. The onomatopoeic name is thought to be derived from that used by New Guineans from nearby Dorey (Manokwari), but it is also used as the name of a genus &quot;Pitohui&quot; which was established by the French naturalist René Lesson in 1831. The unitalicized common name however refers to perching birds that belong to several genera of multiple bird families. The genera include &quot;Ornorectes&quot;, &quot;Melanorectes&quot;, and &quot;Pseudorectes&quot; apart from &quot;Pitohui&quot;.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The Pitohui species were formerly all classified in the genus &quot;Pitohui&quot;, which at the time was in the family Pachycephalidae. In 2013 they were separated into several different genera in several different families.

The species are now separated into three families as follows:

=== Oreoicidae ===

* Crested pitohui (&quot;Ornorectes cristatus&quot;)

=== Pachycephalidae ===

* Black pitohui (&quot;Melanorectes nigrescens&quot;)
* White-bellied pitohui (&quot;Pseudorectes incertus&quot;)
* Rusty pitohui (&quot;Pseudorectes ferrugineus&quot;)

=== Oriolidae ===

* Northern variable pitohui (&quot;Pitohui kirhocephalus&quot;)
* Raja Ampat pitohui (&quot;Pitohui cerviniventris&quot;)
* Southern variable pitohui (&quot;Pitohui uropygialis&quot;)
* Hooded pitohui (&quot;Pitohui dichrous&quot;)

==Description==
Pitohuis are brightly coloured, omnivorous birds. The hooded pitohui has a brick red belly and a jet-black head. The variable pitohui, as its name implies, exists in many different forms, and 20 subspecies with different plumage patterns have been named. Two of them, however, closely resemble the hooded pitohui.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The skin and feathers of some pitohuis, especially the variable and hooded pitohuis, contain powerful neurotoxic alkaloids of the batrachotoxin group (also secreted by the Colombian poison dart frogs, genus &quot;Phyllobates&quot;). These are believed to serve the birds as a chemical defence, either against ectoparasites or against visually guided predators such as snakes, raptors or humans. The birds probably do not produce batrachotoxin themselves. The toxins most likely come from the beetle genus &quot;Choresine&quot;, a part of the birds&#x27; diets. 

The birds&#x27; bright colours are suggested to be an example of aposematism (warning colouration), and the similarity of the hooded pitohui and some forms of the variable pitohui might then be an example of Müllerian mimicry, in which dangerous species gain a mutual advantage by sharing colouration, so an encounter with either species trains a predator to avoid both.

==Relationship to humans==

Due to the toxicity of these birds, Papua New Guineans call the pitohuis rubbish birds and do not eat them; in desperate times, however, they can be consumed only after the feathers and skin have been removed and the flesh is coated in charcoal and then roasted.

<text>Events from the year 1837 in Canada.

==Incumbents==
*Monarch: William IV (died June 20), Victoria (starting June 20)

===Federal government===
*Parliament of Lower Canada: 15th 
*Parliament of Upper Canada: 13th

===Governors===
*Governor of the Canadas: Robert Milnes
*Governor of New Brunswick: George Stracey Smyth
*Governor of Nova Scotia: John Coape Sherbrooke
*Commodore-Governor of Newfoundland: Richard Goodwin Keats
*Governor of Prince Edward Island: Charles Douglass Smith

==Events==
*British attempts to unite the colonies of Upper and Lower Canada lead to revolt. Two separate rebellions, one in Upper and one in Lower Canada, fail to dislodge entrenched elites.
*Along with a general feeling that the government was not democratic, the failure of the executive committee to maintain the confidence of the elected officials leads to violent but unsuccessful rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada. The leaders, William Lyon Mackenzie (Reformers) and Louis-Joseph Papineau (Patriotes), both escape to the U.S.
*Revolts in Upper and Lower Canada. Small businessmen and farmers against merchant elites who, as political leaders, are raising property taxes, tariffs and freight rates to raise money for canals.
*Black militia units participate in putting down the rebellion in Upper Canada.
*British parliament passes Coercion Bill, seizes Lower Canada treasury.
*Chartists organize support in England.
*May – 1837 Newfoundland general election.
*July 31 – Declaration of Toronto Reformers followed by 200 township meetings.
*August 26 – Lord Gosford prorogues Parliament by proclamation. Mr. Papineau finds a copy on his seat, on returning from the audience hall.
*Lord Gosford is now convinced that it is intended to institute a republican form of government, in Canada. Justices of the Peace and officers of Militia are removed from office: Mr. Papineau among them.
*The newspaper &quot;Le Populaire&quot; is started, at Montreal, to quiet the public mind; and, at Quebec, the &quot;Liberal&quot;, a seditious journal.
*The Governor warns the people against rebellion.
*Messrs. Papineau, Lafontaine, Girouard and Morin go through the country, exciting the inhabitants.
*An effigy of the Governor is burnt.
*Mr. Lafontaine says &quot;We have demanded reforms, without obtaining them. It is time to be up and doing.&quot;
*Lord Gosford proposes adding seven Frenchmen to the Legislative Council and nine to the Executive Council.
*Société des Fils de la Liberté (&quot;Sons of Liberty&quot;) secretly drill and prepare munitions; but many of the French remain loyal.
*Among the malcontents are Dr. Nelson, Messrs. Papineau, Wilson, Viger, Lacoste, Brown, and Girod.
*Alarmed at the length excitement has carried him, Mr. Papineau now inclines to the constitutional remedy of ceasing to trade with England, but Dr. Nelson declares that the time for action has come.
*The Roman Catholic Bishop Lartigue, of Montreal, preaches obedience to authority, as a cardinal rule of the Church.
*The R. C. Bishop Signai, of Quebec, warns his flock against revolt, and reminds them that, even in France, where sovereignty resides in the people, it rests, not with a part, but with the whole population; and &quot;who will dare to say that the whole population of this country desire the overthrow of the Government?&quot;
*General Colborne speedily arms 600 inhabitants, and regulars are called from New Brunswick.
*November – William Lyon Mackenzie presents plans to overthrow the government.
*November 6 – In Montreal, the Doric Club come to blows with &quot;Sons of Liberty.&quot;
*The military march through the streets with guns.
*November 23 – Patriotes defeat British army at St. Denis, Lower Canada. At St. Denis, Col. Gore, with five companies of regulars, fails to dislodge rebel Dr. Nelson, with 200 men, behind walls.
*For safety, Mr. Papineau is induced to cross the Line.
*November 24 – William Lyon Mackenzie delivers order to local leaders to march on Toronto December 7.
*November 25 – British defeat Patriotes at St. Charles and return to burn St. Denis.
*November 25 – Col. Wetherall&#x27;s 400 defeat a larger number of rebels, of whom about 100 are killed, 372 wounded, and 30 surrender. At St. Eustache, over 1,200 rebels, under Dr. Chenier and Girod, a Swiss, dwindle to 250. A priest tries to dissuade Dr. Chenier, who replies, with a trea, &quot;I will conquer, or die.&quot;
*Sir John Colborne, with 2,000 and field-pieces, wins the battle. To unarmed followers Dr. Chenier has said: &quot;Be easy; some will be killed – you can take their muskets.&quot; True, there are muskets to spare, but the men to use them are wanting. Girod shoots himself.
*T.S. Brown and Dr. O&#x27;Callaghan cross the Line.
*At St. Benoid, 250 men surrender to Sir John Colborne.
*People return thanks for peace, and promise loyalty.
*Mr. Lafontaine too tardily asks the Governor to summon Parliament. He refuses. Arrests are made on charge of High Treason.
*Rolph panics, calls troops out for December 4.
*December 2 – Troops occupy St. Denis.
*December 4 – Confrontation at Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern. See https://web.archive.org/web/20080511160744/https://www.edunetconnect.com/cat/rebellions/1837f01.html

<text>The Williamson ether synthesis is an organic reaction, forming an ether from an organohalide and a deprotonated alcohol (alkoxide). This reaction was developed by Alexander Williamson in 1850. Typically it involves the reaction of an alkoxide ion with a primary alkyl halide via an SN2 reaction. This reaction is important in the history of organic chemistry because it helped prove the structure of ethers.

The general reaction mechanism is as follows:

An example is the reaction of sodium ethoxide with chloroethane to form diethyl ether and sodium chloride:

==Mechanism==
The Williamson ether reaction follows an SN2 (bimolecular nucleophilic substitution) mechanism. In an SN2 reaction mechanism there is a backside attack of an electrophile by a nucleophile and it occurs in a concerted mechanism (happens all at once). In order for the SN2 reaction to take place there must be a good leaving group which is strongly electronegative, commonly a halide.

In the Williamson ether reaction there is an alkoxide ion (RO−) which acts as the nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbon with the leaving group, which in most cases is an alkyl tosylate or an alkyl halide. The leaving site must be a primary carbon, because secondary and tertiary leaving sites generally prefer to proceed as an elimination reaction. Also, this reaction does not favor the formation of bulky ethers like di-tertbutyl ether, due to steric hindrance and predominant formation of alkenes instead.

==Scope==
The Williamson reaction is of broad scope, is widely used in both laboratory and industrial synthesis, and remains the simplest and most popular method of preparing ethers. Both symmetrical and asymmetrical ethers are easily prepared. The intramolecular reaction of halohydrins in particular, gives epoxides.

In the case of asymmetrical ethers there are two possibilities for the choice of reactants, and one is usually preferable either on the basis of availability or reactivity. The Williamson reaction is also frequently used to prepare an ether indirectly from two alcohols. One of the alcohols is first converted to a leaving group (usually tosylate), then the two are reacted together.

The alkoxide (or aryloxide) may be primary and secondary. Tertiary alkoxides tend to give elimination reaction because of steric hindrance. The alkylating agent, on the other hand is most preferably primary. Secondary alkylating agents also react, but tertiary ones are usually too prone to side reactions to be of practical use. The leaving group is most often a halide or a sulfonate ester synthesized for the purpose of the reaction. Since the conditions of the reaction are rather forcing, protecting groups are often used to pacify other parts of the reacting molecules (e.g. other alcohols, amines, etc.)

The Williamson ether synthesis is a common organic reaction in industrial synthesis and in undergraduate teaching laboratories. Yields for these ether syntheses are traditionally low when reaction times are shortened, which can be the case with undergraduate laboratory class periods. Without allowing the reactions to reflux for the correct amount of time (anywhere from 1–8 hours from 50 to 100 °C) the reaction may not proceed to completion generating a poor overall product yield. To help mitigate this issue microwave-enhanced technology is now being utilized to speed up the reaction times for reactions such as the Williamson ether synthesis. This technology has transformed reaction times that required reflux of at least 1.5 hours to a quick 10-minute microwave run at 130 °C and this has increased the yield of ether synthesized from a range of 6-29% to 20-55% (data was compiled from several different lab sections incorporating the technology in their syntheses).

There have also been significant strides in the synthesis of ethers when using temperatures of 300 °C and up and using weaker alkylating agents to facilitate more efficient synthesis. This methodology helps streamline the synthesis process and makes synthesis on an industrial scale more feasible. The much higher temperature makes the weak alkylating agent more reactive and less likely to produce salts as a byproduct. This method has proved to be highly selective and especially helpful in production of aromatic ethers such as anisole which has increasing industrial applications.

==Conditions==
Since alkoxide ions are highly reactive, they are usually prepared immediately prior to the reactions or are generated &quot;in situ&quot;. In laboratory chemistry, &quot;in situ&quot; generation is most often accomplished by the use of a carbonate base or potassium hydroxide, while in industrial syntheses phase transfer catalysis is very common. A wide range of solvents can be used, but protic solvents and apolar solvents tend to slow the reaction rate strongly, as a result of lowering the availability of the free nucleophile. For this reason, acetonitrile and &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethylformamide are particularly commonly used.

A typical Williamson reaction is conducted at 50 to 100 °C and is complete in 1 to 8 h. Often the complete disappearance of the starting material is difficult to achieve, and side reactions are common. Yields of 50–95% are generally achieved in laboratory syntheses, while near-quantitative conversion can be achieved in industrial procedures.

Catalysis is not usually necessary in laboratory syntheses. However, if an unreactive alkylating agent is used (e.g. an alkyl chloride) then the rate of reaction can be greatly improved by the addition of a catalytic quantity of a soluble iodide salt (which undergoes halide exchange with the chloride to yield a much more reactive iodide, a variant of the Finkelstein reaction). In extreme cases, silver compounds such as silver oxide may be added:

The silver ion coordinates with the halide leaving group to make its departure more facile. Finally, phase transfer catalysts are sometimes used (e.g. tetrabutylammonium bromide or 18-crown-6) in order to increase the solubility of the alkoxide by offering a softer counter-ion.
One more example of etherification reaction in the tri-phasic system under phase transfer catalytic conditions is the reaction of benzyl chloride and furfuryl alcohol.

==Side reactions==
The Williamson reaction often competes with the base-catalyzed elimination of the alkylating agent, and the nature of the leaving group as well as the reaction conditions (particularly the temperature and solvent) can have a strong effect on which is favored. In particular, some structures of alkylating agent can be particularly prone to elimination.

When the nucleophile is an aryloxide ion, the Williamson reaction can also compete with alkylation on the ring since the aryloxide is an ambident nucleophile.

<doc id="485744" wikidata="Q4040141" url="?curid=485744" title="HMS Lancaster (F229)">
<text>HMS &quot;Lancaster&quot; is a Duke-class Type 23 frigate of the Royal Navy, launched by Queen Elizabeth II on 24 May 1990. The ship is known as &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Frigate&quot;, the Duke of Lancaster being a subsidiary title of the Sovereign. Being the third ship in the Type 23 class, &quot;Lancaster&quot; was originally allocated the pennant number F232 until it was noted that the 232 is the Royal Navy report form for groundings and collisions and therefore considered unlucky. She is one of the few ships left in the fleet with some female officers but mess decks which are men-only.

The ship, like her sisters , , and , did not receive the new Sonar 2087 upgrade that other frigates of the class subsequently received. Therefore she is regarded as a &quot;general purpose&quot; frigate without the more specialized anti-submarine capability of the other eight ships in the Type 23 fleet.

==Operational history==

===1992–2000===
In 1994, &quot;Lancaster&quot; deployed on a nine-month mission to the Caribbean Sea, and the Eastern Pacific Ocean, During this time she acted as guardship for the royal yacht , conducted anti-drug smuggling operations and sonar trials. She also acted as guardship for Queen Elizabeth II during the Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, in August 1994.

===2001–2010===

From Feb to July 2001 Lancaster deployed to the Gulf to patrol the Iraq no-fly zone.

&quot;Lancaster&quot; was involved in anti-drug operations in the Caribbean, but also delivered Vice Admiral Adrian Johns in 2009 to his new post as Governor of Gibraltar. In February 2010 &quot;Lancaster&quot; was deployed in waters off the Horn of Africa as part of Combined Task Force 150, tackling piracy, drug-running, people trafficking, arms smuggling, and other criminal and terrorist threats.

In September 2010 &quot;Lancaster&quot; entered refit in Portsmouth.

===2011–2017===
&quot;Lancaster&quot; returned to sea in early 2012 and returned to active service in Spring 2013. The £17.9m contract covered upgrades to communications, the Sea Wolf and command systems, the installation of a 30 mm remote-operated gun and a transom flap. Both shafts were replaced, four refurbished diesel generators installed and new paint applied to the hull. The accommodation, galley and dining halls were all refurbished at the same time. Half the crew returned to the ship in October 2011, under the command of Lt Cdr Charlie Guy until Cdr Steve Moorhouse took over in November 2011. Although the top speed of the Duke class is commonly quoted as , the caption of an official Navy photo suggests that &quot;Lancaster&quot; was capable of even before her mid-life refit; the transom flap can add up to to the top speed of a Type 23, and the Intersleek anti-fouling paint added to the top speed of the carrier &quot;Ark Royal&quot;.

In July to August 2013, she was on a counter-narcotics mission in the Caribbean, seizing a haul of cocaine with an estimated street value of £100 million after sailors and an embarked U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment boarded a speedboat near Puerto Rico.

On 23 March 2015, &quot;Lancaster&quot; became the first ship in the Royal Navy to deploy with the navy&#x27;s new uniform and Wildcat helicopter.

The crew of the &quot;Lancaster&quot; gathered on the deck of the vessel to spell the word sister, as a present from the Royal Navy, on the birth of Princess Charlotte on 2 May 2015.

Between 12 and 16 October 2015 &quot;Lancaster&quot; and participated in the bicentennial anniversary commemorations of Napoleon&#x27;s arrival on Saint Helena after his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, and subsequent surrender to British forces.

In 2015, the ship visited Algiers for three days for official receptions and a short spell of training with ships in the Algerian Navy, including the . She arrived back in the UK on 17 December 2015.

Upon her return to the UK, &quot;Lancaster&quot; entered a period of &quot;extended readiness&quot; in Portsmouth awaiting refit in 2017. &quot;Lancaster&quot; departed Portsmouth on 31 March 2017 under tow for Plymouth.

=== 2018–present ===
&quot;Lancaster&quot; underwent a life extension refit (LIFEX) at HMNB Devonport from 2017 to 2019 which included fitting of the Artisan 3D radar, Sea Ceptor anti-air missiles and strengthening the backbone of the ship.

The ship arrived back to its Home Port, HMNB Portsmouth, in December 2019. The ship was returned to operations in July 2020.

In August 2022, it was reported that in preparation for her planned deployment to the Persian Gulf to replace , &quot;Lancaster&quot; had been fitted with a full complement of eight Harpoon anti-ship missiles. &quot;Lancaster&quot; sailed for the Gulf on August 15 on a deployment starting with NATO exercises in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. Once reaching the Persian Gulf, she was expected to remain forward deployed until 2025 with her crew being rotated every four months. Late in the month, &quot;Lancaster&quot; was diverted, at least temporarily, to shadow the and the destroyer as they manoeuvred in the vicinity of the British Isles. &quot;Lancaster&quot; arrived in the Gulf in November 2022 and a crew swap was performed in December. It was announced in February 2025 that &quot;Lancaster&quot; had deployed the Peregrine UAV for the firsty time during anti-narcotics operations in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Oman; this followed a period of maintenance at Bahrain which included the replacement of a diesel generator and upgrades to weapon systems and sensors.

<text>Almirante Condell is a Duke-class Type 23 frigate in service with the Chilean Navy. It entered service with the Royal Navy in 1991 with the name HMS &quot;Marlborough&quot; as the sixth ship to bear the name. She was named after John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, and served in the Middle East. The frigate was taken out of service in 2005 and sold to Chile. The vessel entered service with the Chilean Navy in 2008 and was renamed &quot;Almirante Condell&quot; after Carlos Condell, a Chilean naval officer during the War of the Pacific. The ship was significantly upgraded from 2020 to 2021 and remains in service.

==Service history==
===Royal Navy===
&quot;Marlborough&quot; is a Duke-class Type 23 frigate and carried pennant number F233 rather than the sequential number of F232 which was considered unlucky, Form S.232 being the formal notification of a grounding or collision. The course 232 is also traditionally not given for the same reason, with a course heading of half degree either side of 232 being the alternative.

&quot;Marlborough&quot; was the first naval ship on the scene to assist the stricken USS &quot;Cole&quot; after she was attacked in Aden, Yemen in October 2000. &quot;Marlborough&quot;, under the command of Captain Anthony Rix, was on passage to the UK after a six-month deployment in the Gulf and had a full medical detachment on board. When her offer of assistance was accepted, she immediately diverted to Aden.

On 27 October 2001, the ship&#x27;s Lynx helicopter crashed into the Arabian Sea after an Omani warship collided with the aircraft as it was hovering above the water. The pilot and observer suffered minor injuries and were taken onboard the aircraft carrier &quot;HMS Illustrious&quot;. The incident happened during exercise ‘Saif Sareea’ (Swift Sword) a joint exercise between British and Omani forces. The Lynx was dropping a dummy torpedo into the sea when an Omani vessel sailed into it from behind, catching the helicopter&#x27;s rotor blades on its rigging.

&quot;Marlborough&quot; played a key role in the second Gulf War, under the command of Captain Mark Anderson.

In July 2004, it was announced that &quot;Marlborough&quot; would be one of three Type 23 ships to be decommissioned by the end of 2006. In October 2004 &quot;Marlborough&quot; again came to the aid of a stricken ally when she was dispatched to assist the submarine , adrift off the northwest Irish coast and arrived at the scene where and &quot;Marlborough&quot;″s sister-ship HMS were present. &quot;Montrose&quot; had been the first ship to make contact with the boat. Other ships were also dispatched, including .

Prior to her decommissioning, &quot;Marlborough&quot; had a US Navy officer permanently assigned to her crew. Reciprocally, a Royal Navy officer was permanently assigned to the destroyer .

===Transfer to Chile===
The 2003 defence cuts committed &quot;Marlborough&quot; to pay off by March 2006. In June 2005, it was announced that &quot;Marlborough&quot; would be sold to the Chilean Navy. The Chilean Navy officially welcomed their new &quot;Almirante Condell&quot; into the fleet at a commissioning ceremony on 28 May 2008. The vessel was the last of three former Royal Navy Type 23 frigates to be handed over to Chile, under a £134 million sales agreement arranged by the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s Disposal Services Authority and signed in September 2005. She joins her sister ships in the Chilean Navy, the former and
, handed over in November 2006 and March 2007 respectively.

Along with other Chilean vessels of her class, &quot;Almirante Condell&quot; underwent a significant upgrade from September 2020 to October 2021. The CMS 330 combat management architecture was installed along TRS-4D G-Band active scanning radars and 32 CAMM Sea Ceptor vertical-launch surface-to-air missile silos to replace the previous Sea Wolf SAM system.

<doc id="485747" wikidata="Q5632895" url="?curid=485747" title="HMS Iron Duke (F234)">
<text>HMS &quot;Iron Duke&quot; is a Type 23 frigate of the Royal Navy, and the third ship to bear the name.

&quot;Iron Duke&quot; has intercepted several large consignments of illegal drugs being sent from the Caribbean to Europe.

In her only combat mission, she was in action off Libya in 2011, destroying a gun battery outside the besieged town of Misrata. She also fired star shells through the night to illuminate pro-Gaddafi positions for NATO aircraft to destroy rocket launchers, fuel dumps, ammo stores, artillery batteries and command and control centres, whilst also confirming that no civilians were in the area.

==Commissioning and construction==

&quot;Iron Duke&quot; was launched on 2 March 1991 by Lady Jane King in the presence of the Duke and Duchess of Wellington. Her affiliated town is Kingston upon Hull, and she is named after Arthur Wellesley, the first Duke of Wellington (the &quot;Iron Duke&quot;). She was the fifth Duke-class Type 23 frigate to be launched for the Royal Navy, at a cost of £140 million.

The motto of &quot;Iron Duke&quot; is &quot;Virtutis Fortuna Comes&quot; (Latin: &quot;Fortune is the companion of valour&quot;) – inherited from the 33rd (The Duke of Wellington&#x27;s) Regiment of Foot.

&quot;Iron Duke&quot; carries a number of weapons and sensors which make her a multi-purpose combat vessel. Like all T23s, her original design role was anti-submarine warfare, but she can be employed in a variety of roles. She carries a Wildcat Helicopter which can be used in an anti-submarine and anti-surface role as well as for humanitarian and search and rescue purposes. The ship, like her sisters HMS Monmouth, HMS Montrose, HMS Lancaster and HMS Argyll, did not receive the new Sonar 2087 upgrade that other frigates of the class subsequently received. Therefore she has been regarded as a &quot;general purpose&quot; frigate without the more specialized anti-submarine capability of the other eight ships in the Type 23 fleet. However, on the retirement of HMS Westminster in 2024, it was reported that the S2087 towed array from that ship would now be fit to &quot;Iron Duke&quot; instead.

&quot;Iron Duke&quot; was the First of Class fit for the Royal Navy&#x27;s new Type 997 Artisan 3D, successfully firing her missile system, using the new radar combined with the updated &#x27;SWMLU&#x27; Seawolf missile targeting system, in the English Channel.

==Operational history==

===1993–2000===


In 2000, under the command of Commander Ben Key for Atlantic Patrol Tasking (South), &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was part of the Royal Navy task force—comprising , , , , and four RFA ships—that deployed to Sierra Leone during the civil war there. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; relieved &quot;Argyll&quot; of her duties in September. During this incident &quot;Argyll&quot;, assisted by &quot;Ocean&quot;, laid the foundation for the Iron Duke Community School;a school for orphans in Freetown. President Kabbah of Sierra Leone decreed the school be named after the &quot;Iron Duke&quot; in honour of their crew completing the construction of the six classrooms.

During this deployment &quot;Iron Duke&quot; also visited the Falkland Islands, Brazil, Ghana, Senegal and attended Exponaval 2000 when she made a good will visit to Valparaiso, Chile, to help improve relations with the UK&#x27;s traditional ally. This was the RN&#x27;s first visit since the General Pinochet affair.

===2001–2010===
In May 2002 &quot;Iron Duke&quot; re-entered service after a refit, armed with a new 4.5 inch Mod 1 gun. Under the command of Commander Phil Warwick, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; sailed into Portsmouth for her re-dedication. Amongst those in attendance were the present Duke of Wellington and Earl Jellicoe, both related to figures associated with the ship&#x27;s name and career. The following January &quot;Iron Duke&quot; deployed to the Caribbean for counter-drugs operations, hurricane season disaster relief standby, and visiting UK Overseas Territories for diplomatic purposes. This was the frigate&#x27;s first operation since completing her refit at the end of 2001 and comprehensive training including multi-national exercises off Scotland.

In February 2006 &quot;Iron Duke&quot; conducted trials in Loch Goil and Loch Fyne.

In September 2006 &quot;Iron Duke&quot;, under Commander Andy Jordan, was providing a presence for UK overseas territories in the Caribbean and providing the UK contribution to the war on drugs. She returned to the UK in December 2006. During her six-month deployment, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; steamed over , and made 22 port visits to 18 different locations.

In 2007 &quot;Iron Duke&quot;, now under the command of Commander Andy Gurr, was dry-docked for ten months at HMNB Portsmouth. Various systems were upgraded including the anti-submarine warfare equipment, and the ability to operate the Merlin helicopter was added. The first installation of a NATO Radial Chemical, Biological, Radioactive, Nuclear filter system was made; this filter was undergoing trials prior to installation across the fleet, if successful.

After 18 months of refit and upgrading, by March 2008 &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was halfway through her Operational Sea Training, in readiness for deployment to the North Atlantic at the end of May. All aspects of warfare were included in the training, including the infamous &#x27;Thursday War&#x27; training exercise.

On 18 April 2008 &quot;Iron Duke&quot; deployed to Avonmouth to train in sea and harbour safety. Avon and Somerset Police assisted in training in the co-operation between the Royal Navy and uniformed police in the event of harbour security being breached. Civic dignitaries also viewed the ship. Later in April the &quot;Iron Duke&quot;″s Operational Sea Training increased in difficulty with a simulation of tension between Brownian and Ginger forces with negotiations in neutral Freeport (Devonport) and a high risk of terrorist attacks. This exercise tested the defensive capabilities of the ship and the flexibility of proportional response to threats. Later in the series of exercises a hurricane hit the simulated island of Bullpoint, allowing &quot;Iron Duke&quot; to test her disaster relief capabilities including first aid, providing food and shelter to the survivors and helping to rebuild basic amenities.

&quot;Iron Duke&quot; visited her home town, Kingston upon Hull, over the weekend of 26 to 29 April 2008 and was open to the public for six hours.

By Friday 13 June &quot;Iron Duke&quot; arrived in Lisbon, Portugal after two operational stand-offs to determine that she was ready to deploy operationally. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was briefed by the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre-Narcotics, a pan-European counter-narcotics agency, about intelligence on criminal matters such as cannabis and cocaine smuggling on the high seas. She then moved to Gibraltar for re-supply and the infamous Rock Run. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was now on Maritime Security Patrol in the North Atlantic.

As of 31 August 2008 &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was dispatched to assist relief efforts for the Atlantic Hurricane Gustav.

&quot;Iron Duke&quot; has intercepted illegal drugs being shipped from the Caribbean to Europe on several occasions, sometimes aided by embarked United States Coast Guard personnel. Large shipments were intercepted on 25 June 2003 (3.7 tonnes of cocaine on MV &quot;Yalta&quot;), 2 June 2008 (900 kilograms of cocaine in a speedboat which later sank), late July 2009 (drugs with a street value of £33 million on a speedboat later sunk by gunfire). and September 2009 (5.5 tonnes of cocaine).

===2011–present===

&quot;Iron Duke&quot; spent the first half of 2011 in the Persian Gulf before relieving off the coast Libya where she took part in combat operations for the first time in her 20-year history. She entered the Joint Operating Area on 16 July 2011 and over the course of the next five days, she went to Action Stations several times to support operations ashore. She was responsible for the destruction of a gun battery outside the besieged town of Misrata, while the frigate’s 4.5-inch gun fired many illuminating starshells to light up targets for NATO planes.
She returned to Portsmouth in late July, in a joint homecoming with her sister ship 

The Royal Navy&#x27;s next generation helicopter, Wildcat, completed 20 days of demanding trials aboard &quot;Iron Duke&quot;, her first frigate, in January 2012.

In March 2012 &quot;Iron Duke&quot; began a major refit in HM Naval Base, Portsmouth. Some major parts of the work package took place for the first time on a Type 23 class of ship, as the MOD looks to extend the life of the Type 23 frigates beyond the original time frame to coincide with the introduction of the Type 26 class of ships, the first which is currently expected to enter service as soon as possible after 2020. Also included in the refit was the installation of BAE Systems Artisan medium-range 3D surveillance radar and in June 2013 she was put back at sea. She test fired 7.62mm rounds from her General Purpose Machine Guns and Mini-Guns, 3lb ceremonial guns and the torpedo system. In early 2014, she successfully fired her new &#x27;SWMLU&#x27; Seawolf missile system against towed targets, destroying two simulated hostile aircraft skimming the surface of the sea, targeting from the brand new 3D radar system.

On 20 June 2014, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; deployed on operations for the first time since her refit. The frigate will sail down the Atlantic, gradually working its way down south via the west coast of Africa to the British Overseas Territories in the region. It is a routine deployment known as Atlantic Patrol Tasking (South). On 20 August 2014, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; received a 21 gun salute as she approached Robben Island to dock at the V&amp;A Waterfront in Cape Town, South Africa.

In January 2016, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; sailed on a six-month deployment including being tasked to Standing NATO Maritime Group 1. She took part in Exercise Dynamic Guard, and Exercise BALTOPS 16.

In June 2017, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was assigned to maritime security operations and training around the United Kingdom but deployed at short notice to represent the Royal Navy in the BALTOPS exercise in the Baltic. Upon completion of the exercise she took part in Kiel Week 2017.
&quot;Iron Duke&quot; was exhibited at the National Armed Forces day in Liverpool which ran from 24–25 June 2017 where the prime minister Theresa May visited the ship. &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was also open to the public. On 28 June, in company with , &quot;Iron Duke&quot; provided escort for the aircraft carrier during her first days of sea trials. It was reported in 2018 that &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was laid up alongside in Portsmouth as a training ship since mid-2017, owing to a lack of manpower to fully crew the ship. In January 2019, the ship was towed out of Portsmouth for a major refit at Devonport, Plymouth. This &#x27;LIFEX&#x27; refit would add Sea Ceptor, Artisan radar and new diesel generator sets. The ship&#x27;s nearly five-year refit involved nearly 1.7 million hours of labour and was completed in 2023. She returned to sea for post-refit sea trials in May 2023.

In November 2024, HMS &quot;Iron Duke&quot;, along with tanker RFA &quot;Tideforce&quot;, monitored a trio of Russian vessels: the &quot;Admiral Gorshkov&quot;-class frigate &quot;Admiral Golovko&quot;, oceanographic research vessel &quot;Yantar&quot; and &quot;Kaliningradneft&quot;-class tanker &quot;Vyazma&quot; as they passed through the North Sea and English Channel en route to the Atlantic. All three had been tracked by the Royal Norwegian Navy before the Royal Navy took over. HMS &quot;Iron Duke&quot; and RFA &quot;Tideforce&quot; both followed the trio through the Dover Strait and Channel before handing over monitoring duties to the French Navy. The &quot;Yantar&quot;, however, continued to remain in the UK’s area of interest, heading north into the Irish Sea, with minehunter HMS &quot;Cattistock&quot; monitoring the survey vessel. As the &quot;Golovko&quot; and &quot;Vyazma&quot; continued their journey past France, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; took over shadowing duties of a second Russian group: frigate &quot;Neustrashimy&quot; and the replenishment oiler &quot;Akademik Pashin&quot;, which were making for their home port in the Baltic. The British ships remained in contact with the pair back through the Channel and into the North Sea before handing over to Dutch warship, HNLMS &quot;De Ruyter&quot; to finish escorting them back into the Baltic. Throughout the week-long operation, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; made use of both her own Wildcat helicopter from 815 Naval Air Squadron, plus a Merlin of 814 Naval Air Squadron based at Culdrose, an RAF P8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft and aerial assets of other allies to ensure the Russian vessels were closely monitored throughout.

HMS Iron Duke conducted a similar operation tracking Russian vessels in the Channel in February 2025.

<doc id="485748" wikidata="Q5633425" url="?curid=485748" title="HMS Monmouth (F235)">
<text>HMS &quot;Monmouth&quot; was the sixth Duke-class Type 23 frigate of the Royal Navy. She was the seventh ship to bear the name and was launched by Lady Eaton in 1991, being commissioned two years later.

Affectionately known as &quot;The Black Duke&quot;, &quot;Monmouth&quot; was the only ship in service with the Royal Navy that has its name painted in black (all other RN vessels have their name in red) and flew a plain black flag in addition to the ensign. This is due to the dissolution of the title and the blacking out of the coat of arms of the Duke of Monmouth in 1685 following the Monmouth Rebellion against James II of England. Until her decommissioning, &quot;Monmouth&quot; carried the most battle honours of any ship name that was serving in the Royal Navy. HMS &quot;Monmouth&quot; was decommissioned on the 30 June 2021 and is now awaiting disposal in Fareham creek under the care of the disposal and reserve ships organisation.

==Construction and career==
===1993–2000===
&quot;Monmouth&quot; visited Wellington, New Zealand in June 1995 in company with , the first UK or US warship to visit New Zealand since the 1985 ANZUS dispute.

In February 1997, while being prepared for launch in poor weather, &quot;Monmouth&quot; Lynx helicopter slid off the side of the flight deck and sank off the Devon coast. The aircraft&#x27;s crew were rescued by the ship&#x27;s sea boat.

In October 1997, &quot;Monmouth&quot;, in company with and , stood by off Pointe Noire in West Africa on Operation Kingfisher in readiness for evacuation in the aftermath of the First Congo War. On 11 February 1998, &quot;Monmouth&quot; was ordered to stand by off Sierra Leone as part of Operation Resilient to provide humanitarian assistance during the Sierra Leone Civil War. In 1999 &quot;Monmouth&quot; became the first major Royal Navy vessel to visit Dublin, Ireland, since the 1960s.

===2001–2010===
In early 2004 the ship was assigned to the Atlantic Patrol Task North. Between late 2004 and 2006 she was commanded by Jerry Kyd. In 2006 &quot;Monmouth&quot; underwent operational sea training, conducted by Flag Officer Sea Training, in which she spent six weeks fighting off staged attacks by ships and submarines.

&quot;Monmouth&quot; returned to berth at her home port HMNB Devonport on 3 December 2007 having completed a circumnavigation of the globe, visiting Australia, New Zealand, and Hawaii and taking part in a FPDA exercise. In 2008 she went into refit and in 2009 deployed to the Persian Gulf, returning in April 2010. On 27 May 2010, she escorted the fleet of &quot;little ships&quot; commemorating the 70th anniversary of Operation Dynamo, the evacuation from Dunkirk on 27 May – 4 June 1940 of approximately 340,000 British and French soldiers, and one of the most celebrated military events in British history.

===2011 onwards===
&quot;Monmouth&quot; spent June 2011 in the Indian Ocean patrolling the waters off Somalia as part of the ongoing multi-national anti-piracy operations in the region. The deployment also saw her spend some time in Victoria, the capital of the Seychelles where she took part in the islands&#x27; independence celebrations.

In February 2012, &quot;Monmouth&quot; began a six-week refit period at Devonport&#x27;s frigate shed, following on from a seven-month deployment in the Indian Ocean which began in 2011. For the refit, the ship was taken out of the water into an enclosed dry-dock.

In May 2013, she returned to her home port after a seven-month mission to the Persian Gulf. &quot;Monmouth&quot; also hosted an International Principal Warfare Officer&#x27;s course in 2013. She participated in Exercise Joint Warrior in 2013. From October 2013, &quot;Monmouth&quot; was operating in home waters as the Fleet Ready Escort.

In June 2015, &quot;Monmouth&quot; emerged from an 18-month refit in Devonport for sea trials and made her first ever visit to Hamburg, Germany, in December.

In February 2016, &quot;Monmouth&quot; and her sister participated in NATO exercise Dynamic Guard in Norwegian waters. In August, &quot;Monmouth&quot;, in company with and , anchored off Bournemouth for the town&#x27;s annual air festival. By September, she was exercising in Canadian waters and was involved in the rescue of an injured Canadian fisherman east of Nova Scotia.

In March 2017, &quot;Monmouth&quot; sailed from Devonport to relieve in the Persian Gulf; in May she was participating in Combined Task Force 150 when they stopped and searched a fishing boat in the Indian Ocean discovering of cannabis and of heroin. In June 2017, &quot;Monmouth&quot;″s Wildcat rescued a crewman from the sunken merchant tanker &quot;Rama 2&quot; and transferred them to for treatment. She returned to the UK in time for Christmas 2017.

&quot;Monmouth&quot; was deployed on 23 August 2018 from Plymouth as escort for the aircraft carrier , as she sailed to the eastern seaboard of the United States for &#x27;Westlant 18&#x27;, during which the carrier conducted F-35 Lightning II flying trials. The task group consisted of and possibly a Royal Navy submarine. HMS &quot;Monmouth&quot;″s Wildcat HMA2 helicopter, nicknamed &quot;Blackjack&quot;, of 213 Flight, 815 NAS, became the first Wildcat to land aboard HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; on 3 September 2018.

The ship prepared to go into refit in early 2019, and her ship&#x27;s company became the Starboard crew of sister ship which is forward-deployed to Bahrain until 2022. By the end of 2020 the ship was reported to have been stripped of weapons and sensors and laid up. On 22 March 2021, it was announced that both Type 23 frigates &quot;Monmouth&quot; and &quot;Montrose&quot; would be decommissioned earlier than planned as part of the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s Integrated Review. As a result of this decision, &quot;Monmouth&quot; did not undergo a life extension refit as other members of her class have, and is currently awaiting disposal. &quot;Monmouth&quot; was decommissioned on 30 June 2021. She was the only Type 23 frigate - British or Chilean - to never receive the Sea Ceptor missile system.

<text>HMS &quot;Westminster&quot; is a Type 23 frigate of the Royal Navy, and the second ship to bear the name. She was launched on 4 February 1992 and named after the Dukedom of Westminster.

==Operational history==
===1994–2000===
In early August 1995, Operation Harlech was initiated in response to a volcanic eruption in Montserrat. The &quot;Westminster&quot; arrived off the island on 9 August and provided emergency relief aid. The ship was joined by on 19 August, both ships provided emergency relief assistance until the end of the month.

&quot;Westminster&quot; was used for the interior shots in the 1997 James Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; as three different (fictional) Type 23 frigates – HMS &quot;Chester&quot;, HMS &quot;Devonshire&quot; and HMS &quot;Bedford&quot;. 

On 3 February 1999, &quot;Westminster&quot; joined the Atlantic Patrol Ship South, relieving which was taking part in Operation Basilica in Sierra Leone. When the situation improved it was decided to withdraw &quot;Westminster&quot; and she sailed from the area on 18 March.

===2001–2010===
In 2004, &quot;Westminster&quot; was assigned one of the Royal Navy&#x27;s first Merlin helicopters. Also in 2004, the ship was the first to be fitted with the new low-frequency Sonar 2087 designed to detect the most advanced submarines. The technology is controversial as its effects on marine wildlife remain unclear.

In December 2005, the ship&#x27;s company of &quot;Westminster&quot; were all granted Freedom of the City of Westminster. 200 naval officers and sailors in full ceremonial uniform paraded through the streets of London from Westminster Abbey to Horse Guards as part of the celebration service. &quot;Westminster&quot; was chosen as a very rare recognition of her contributions to Westminster schools, local charities and the community as a whole. The honour entitles the crew the freedom to &quot;parade through the City on all ceremonial occasions in full panoply and with drums beating, colours flying and bayonets fixed&quot;.

The frigate was deployed to Burma in May 2008 to spearhead the British relief effort after Cyclone Nargis devastated the country, but later had to withdraw after the junta refused to grant permission for aid to be landed.

===2011–2022===
In March 2011, &quot;Westminster&quot; took part in Operation Ellamy, the British role in the coalition action during the 2011 Libyan civil war by enforcing a naval blockade. She took part in Exercise Saxon Warrior in the Western Approaches with the US aircraft carrier in May 2011, culminating in a so-called &#x27;Thursday War&#x27;.

On 23 January 2012, &quot;Westminster&quot; departed Portsmouth to reinforce the British guided-missile destroyer that was also underway for the Persian Gulf to relieve the frigate .

Whilst in the Persian Gulf she made a port call in Dubai where one of her sailors (Leading Seaman Timothy Andrew MacColl, 27, from Gosport in Hampshire) disappeared, prompting a bilateral search between the Royal Navy and local authorities. He was declared dead by the Royal Navy in May 2014.

In early 2013, she was part of the multi-national Exercise Joint Warrior, practising amphibious operations off the coast of Scotland. In September she was part of the COUGAR 13 task group, for a series of joint exercises in the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf. She visited Gibraltar on the way to the Middle East. This came amidst growing tensions between Spain and Britain over the status of Gibraltar; however the British Government described the visit as &#x27;routine&#x27;. In September 2013, she practised anti-submarine drills with the Italian Navy&#x27;s and the . In the Gulf of Oman, &quot;Westminster&quot; conducted anti-submarine drills against . In October 2013, she exercised with the Indian Navy off Goa.

On 8 September 2014, she docked at East India Dock, by Canary Wharf, in London. In November 2014, &quot;Westminster&quot; entered extended refit in Portsmouth; she returned to sea in January 2017 with a new principal weapon system, Sea Ceptor, in place of Seawolf, Radar Type 997 and numerous modifications and alterations to her accommodation and working spaces.

&quot;Westminster&quot;, in company with sailed with USS &quot;George H.W. Bush&quot; again, as in 2011, by taking part in Exercise Saxon Warrior off Scotland.

During December 2018 on a tour of the Baltic Sea, &quot;Westminster&quot; experienced problems with her propulsion and engines while visiting the port of Gdynia, curtailing other port visits in the region.

In July 2020, she took part in NATO exercise Dynamic Mongoose.

In September 2022, &quot;Westminster&quot; fired two Harpoon missiles in &quot;Operation Atlantic Thunder 22&quot; in a SinkEx exercise alongside US forces in which the decommissioned US frigate was sunk in the North Atlantic.

In 2022, &quot;Westminster&quot; spent 90 days at sea.

&quot;Westminster&quot; entered a planned two-year refit in October 2022 with the intent of extending her service life until 2028–29.

===2023–present===
In May 2023, it was reported that the refit had been suspended due to the poor material condition of the ship, making her future uncertain.

In January 2024, it was reported that &quot;Westminster&quot; may be decommissioned and the crew reassigned to a future Type 26 frigate. In May 2024, it was indicated that HMS &quot;Westminster&quot; would be retired and scrapped.

<text>HMS &quot;Northumberland&quot; is a Type 23 frigate of the Royal Navy. She is named after the Duke of Northumberland. She is the eighth RN ship to bear the name since the first 70-gun ship of the line in 1679, and the ninth in the class of Type 23 frigates. She is based at Devonport and is part of the Devonport Flotilla.

On the 20th November 2024 Secretary of State for Defence, John Healey, announced the ship would be decommissioned stating the ships damage is &quot;uneconomical to repair.&quot;

==Service history==

===Construction===
&quot;Northumberland&quot; is one of four Type 23 frigates built by Swan Hunter on the Tyne at Wallsend. She was launched by her sponsor Lady Kerr, wife of Admiral Sir John Kerr, the former Commander-in-Chief Naval Home Command, in April 1992 and was accepted into Royal Naval Service in May 1994.

===1994–2000===
After sea trials and going through F.O.S.T. &quot;Northumberland&quot; was deployed to the Falklands. During her passage, &quot;Northumberland&quot; had to divert into rough weather to effect the rescue of a fishing trawler; during the diversion the ship allegedly struck a whale; although the damage was actually caused by the vessel &quot;slamming&quot; in high seas at speed whilst proceeding to the rescue. At Tenerife, after dropping off the rescued fishermen, the bow dome began to leak; this continued during her resumed voyage to the Falkland Islands. &quot;Northumberland&quot; took up station at South Georgia undertaking fishery protection duties; when this was complete a dry dock was found in Rio de Janeiro that was suitable to carry out a bow dome change. Once better weather arrived she sailed to Brazil to be put into dry dock. She was escorted in by two ex-Royal Navy Type 22 frigates. Once in the dry dock, repairs took three weeks at a cost of £3 million.

Deploying to the Caribbean in 1999 for counter narcotics and disaster relief duties, &quot;Northumberland&quot; seized over two tonnes of cocaine (with a street-value of £135 million), in cooperation with a United States Coast Guard law enforcement detachment.

===2001–2010===
From July 2004 to July 2005, &quot;Northumberland&quot; underwent an extensive refit at Number 1 Dock (Inner) at Babcock&#x27;s dockyard in Rosyth, her first refit since build. This refit saw her equipped with an updated suite of weapons and sensors (including a modified 4.5&quot; Gun and the latest Low Frequency Active Sonar) and of propulsion and mechanical systems. Improvements were also made to the living quarters and a state of the art galley to feed the Ship&#x27;s Company. Also replaced were corroded areas of the flight deck. Improvements were made to the lighting system used during night landings and a new helicopter handling system to move a 13-ton Merlin helicopter safely in and out of the hangar was installed. (Although the Type 23 was originally designed to operate the Merlin, &quot;Northumberland&quot; had previously only hosted the much smaller Lynx.) The combination of 2087 LFAS and Merlin ASW helicopter has subsequently proved highly effective and the class is widely regarded as the most capable anti-submarine frigate afloat.

&quot;Northumberland&quot; rejoined the fleet at the Trafalgar 200 celebrations, then embarked for a period of sea training, starting with BOST (Basic Operational Sea Training) in January 2006, straight after the Christmas leave period. For a time during 2006 &quot;Northumberland&quot; accompanied the submarine on her deployment to the US AUTEC (Acoustic Undersea Testing and Evaluation Centre) which is based on Andros Island in the Bahamas. In 2007 she deployed to the Mediterranean as part of the UK&#x27;s contribution to NATO maritime forces.

In 2008, &quot;Northumberland&quot; deployed to the Indian Ocean as the first RN warship to participate in the EU&#x27;s counter piracy Operation Atalanta, conducting numerous counter-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden and escorting World Food Programme humanitarian shipping between Mombasa and Mogadishu; this was partially documented in the Sky TV programme &quot;Ross Kemp in Search of Pirates&quot;.

She deployed to the Indian Ocean again in 2010 for an eight-month counter-piracy patrol as part of the international naval counter-piracy task force, TF 151 and conducted numerous operations to disrupt piracy activity in the Gulf of Aden and the eastern Somali coast.

&quot;Northumberland&quot; returned to the UK at the end of 2010 to prepare to enter refit in 2011.

===2011–2020===
As part of an extensive refit at the beginning of 2011, &quot;Northumberland&quot; received several significant technology upgrades. The Sea Wolf point defence missile system was upgraded with the Sea Wolf Mid-Life Update (SWMLU – aka &quot;swimloo&quot;) which substantially improved the range, performance and reliability of the system. The combat system was upgraded from outfit DNA to DNA2, replacing the combat system architecture to improve redundancy and system performance, and a software upgrade which significantly improves overall functionality and sensor integration, as well as providing MMI convergence with the Type 45 destroyer&#x27;s command system. The two 30mm BMARC cannons were replaced by two 30mm Automated Small Calibre Gun (ASCG) mountings. These allow remote control of the mount via operator consoles and integrated Electro Optic fire control. Additional modifications improved habitability and reliability in high ambient temperatures.

Emerging from refit in the summer of 2011, &quot;Northumberland&quot; completed her sea trials and weapon acceptance programme, conducting eight weeks of Basic Operational Sea Training (BOST) in early 2012. She deployed back to the Indian Ocean in the Autumn of 2012 for counter-piracy and counter-narcotics tasking. This included the successful capture and destruction of over £5M of cannabis resin from a smuggler in the Arabian Sea. She returned to the UK in May 2013.

&quot;Northumberland&quot; participated in Exercise Joint Warrior 2013.

The ship joined the COUGAR 14 Response Force Task Group deployment for exercises in the Mediterranean and Gulf regions.

&quot;Northumberland&quot; eventually returned to Devonport on 5 December 2014 after a deployment which included visits to Gibraltar, Souda Bay in Crete, Bahrain, Dubai and Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates, Mumbai in India, Muscat in Oman, Malta and Lisbon.

On 9 May 2015, &quot;Northumberland&quot; was present in St Peter Port for the commemorations marking the 70th anniversary of Guernsey&#x27;s Liberation. A month later, &quot;Northumberland&quot; moored off Cowes in company with HM Ships and to mark the 200th anniversary of the Royal Yacht Squadron. Celebrations began with a reception and capability demonstration onboard hosted by the Second Sea Lord. Guests included the Duke of Edinburgh, as Admiral of the Royal Yacht Squadron, and foreign royals including King Harald of Norway, Juan Carlos, the former king of Spain and Prince Henrik of Denmark.

Later in June 2015, &quot;Northumberland&quot; played a key role in the Waterloo 200 celebrations by carrying the New Waterloo Dispatch letter across the English Channel from Ostend to Broadstairs as part of an elaborate re-enactment retracing the route of , the naval sloop which carried the original letter that brought the news of the victory of the Battle of Waterloo back to England in 1815.

In 2016, during preparations for entering refit in Devonport, &quot;Northumberland&quot; hosted the semi-final stage of the BBC series Masterchef. As part of her re-fit, she was upgraded with Sea Ceptor surface-to-air missiles and returned to sea in 2018

In late 2020, with a television crew filming on board, a Russian submarine being tracked in the North Atlantic hit &quot;Northumberland&quot;&#x27;s towed sonar, requiring the frigate to abort the 48-hour mission to find the submarine and return to port to replace the sonar. The Ministry of Defence does not normally comment on such incidents, but this one was caught on camera.

In December 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;Northumberland&quot; returned to Devonport after a number of suspected COVID-19 cases had been discovered on board. The ship was previously tasked with patrolling UK waters over the festive period but returned to Devonport so that the crew could isolate, in accordance with health guidelines. The Royal Navy stated that the ship would still continue to meet its operational tasks over Christmas.

===Since 2021===

In June 2021, &quot;Northumberland&quot;, along with &quot;Tamar&quot; and &quot;Tyne&quot;, was deployed off the Cornish coast to provide security for the 2021 G7 summit.

In 2022, &quot;Northumberland&quot; spent 191 days at sea.

During the July 2023 and July 2024 visits of USS Tennessee (SSBN-734) to HMNB Clyde, &quot;Northumberland&quot; was seen escorting the U.S. Submarine during its surface transits.

In mid-2024, unconfirmed reports suggested that, on starting her upkeep period, &quot;Northumberland&quot; had been found to be &quot;beyond economical repair&quot; and that she might therefore not return to service.

On the 20th November 2024, Defence Secretary John Healey, announced that due to structural damage discovered during her refit &quot;Northumberland&quot; was uneconomical to repair and would be retired from the fleet by March 2025.

<text>HMS &quot;Richmond&quot; is a Type 23 frigate of the Royal Navy. She was launched on 6 April 1993 by Lady Hill-Norton, wife of the late Admiral of the Fleet The Lord Hill-Norton, and was the last warship to be built by Swan Hunter Shipbuilders. She sailed from the builders on the River Tyne in November 1994. She is named for the Dukedom of Richmond.

==Operational history==
===1995–2000===

&quot;Richmond&quot; was first deployed in 1997 to the Far East as part of the &#x27;Ocean Wave 97&#x27; Task Group. One of the most interesting visits she made was to the Russian port of Vladivostok, an important Russian naval base, where she became the first Royal Navy vessel to visit in over 100 years. Also that year &quot;Richmond&quot; escorted the royal yacht on the ship&#x27;s final leg of her final tour of the United Kingdom prior to her decommissioning.

In 1998 &quot;Richmond&quot; participated in two significant NATO naval exercises and arrived in New York where she was involved in the US Navy Fleet Week. In 1999 &quot;Richmond&quot; was dispatched to the South Atlantic as part of Atlantic Patrol Task (South) and underwent a major overhaul which concluded in 2000.

===2001–2010===
In 2001 &quot;Richmond&quot; joined the NATO multi-national squadron Standing Naval Force Mediterranean. In 2002 she arrived in the Caribbean where she performed tasks including obligatory &quot;fly-the-flag&quot; duties to the Commonwealth countries in the region as well as undergoing trials. In June 2002, two officers were killed when &quot;Richmond&quot;″s Lynx helicopter crashed off the coast of Virginia.

In 2003 she deployed to the Persian Gulf on Armilla Patrol where she relieved . She had arrived shortly before the 2003 Iraq War. When hostilities began, &quot;Richmond&quot;, HM ships , and of the Royal Australian Navy provided Naval Gunfire Support (NGS) during the Royal Marines&#x27; amphibious assault of the Al Faw Peninsula, the first amphibious assault by the Marines since the Falklands War in 1982. &quot;Richmond&quot; remained in the region at the war&#x27;s end and returned home in August.

In July 2004 &quot;Richmond&quot; deployed on Atlantic Patrol Task (North), which encompasses the Atlantic and Caribbean regions. Two of the ports she visited early in the deployment were Jamaica and Belize. In September &quot;Richmond&quot; came to the assistance of the Turks and Caicos Islands when they were struck by Hurricane Frances. Turks and Caicos suffered only minimal damage to buildings. &quot;Richmond&quot; then sailed to Curaçao, Netherlands Antilles where she resumed her maintenance period, which had been interrupted due to the hurricane, but remained on standby to provide assistance due to the imminent arrival of Hurricane Ivan.

Hurricane Ivan eventually hit the region, causing significant damage and fatalities, particularly inflicting enormous damage and a number of fatalities to Grenada, which included immense damage to the capital St. George&#x27;s. &quot;Richmond&quot; and her accompanying Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel came to the assistance of the island. The extent of the damage in Grenada reached such levels that Keith Mitchell, Prime Minister of Grenada, was forced to relocate to &quot;Richmond&quot; after his residence was destroyed by the hurricane. The Prime Minister effectively ran his country from &quot;Richmond&quot; for several hours.

Her crew having performed vital assistance on land at Grenada, &quot;Richmond&quot; steamed at her top speed for Jamaica and the Cayman Islands to assist those territories in recovering from the ravages of Hurricane Ivan.

&quot;Richmond&quot; returned from her deployment in December 2004, and began a refit period at HM Naval Base Portsmouth in mid-2005. The refit, undertaken by Fleet Support Limited, was completed in late 2006 and &quot;Richmond&quot; was returned to the operational fleet in October 2006. With 44 major upgrades to her sensor and weapon systems, &quot;Richmond&quot; was at that time one of the most capable Type 23 frigates. From 5 to 12 July 2010 she anchored beside in London to foster the ship&#x27;s relations with the Borough of Richmond-upon-Thames.

===2011–2019===

In 2011, she deployed to the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region, the latter for upcoming Five Power Defence Arrangement exercises, specifically Exercise Bersama Shield 11. She assisted with anti-piracy operations with the EU Naval Force and was also a participant in the IMEX Asia 2011. After Singapore, she rendered honours to the fallen of Force Z (see the Sinking of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot;). She took part in exercise FRUKUS 2011 with ships from the United States Navy and Russian Navy.

In early August 2013, she deployed as the Royal Navy&#x27;s Atlantic Patrol South where she carried out Maritime Security Patrols in the Falkland Islands. HMS &quot;Richmond&quot; returned to the UK in February 2014. This deployment involved high-profile defence engagement visits to five continents and resulted in the ship receiving Commander British Forces South Atlantic Islands Commendation for Distinguished Service. Of note, during her seven months away &quot;Richmond&quot; conducted visits to five British Dependent Overseas Territories including Ascension Island, St Helena, the Falklands, South Georgia and Tristan da Cunha. During this deployment &quot;Richmond&quot; became the first Royal Navy warship to transit the Panama Canal in its centenary year.

In October 2015 &quot;Richmond&quot; was deployed to the Mediterranean to aid the EU&#x27;s fight against people smugglers due to refugees fleeing civil war in Syria. She returned to her home port on 11 December 2015.

In October 2016 &quot;Richmond&quot; and the destroyer were dispatched by the Ministry of Defence to intercept and &quot;man-mark&quot; a fleet of Russian Navy vessels, including their flagship passing through the English Channel on their way to Syria.

On 6 January 2017, &quot;Richmond&quot; featured in Series 1, episode 9 of &quot;The Grand Tour&quot;. The ship and her weaponry star in a sequence where James May and Jeremy Clarkson commandeer the 4.5-inch Mark 8 naval gun to destroy an armoured vehicle manufactured by Richard Hammond. In June 2017, &quot;Richmond&quot; docked at Chatham on the Medway to mark 350 years since the Raid on the Medway. &quot;Richmond&quot; entered refit at Devonport in the late summer of 2017. In November it was announced that on completion of the work in 2018 she will not return to Portsmouth and will switch base port to Plymouth in an effort to concentrate the Type 23s fitted with anti-submarine equipment in the city. The refit saw the ship become the first Type 23 to be fitted with MTU M53B diesel generators - these will be fitted to the remainder of the class (except and ), as well as the Type 26.

===2020–present===
In February 2020, &quot;Richmond&quot; went to sea to for post-refit tests. These included the new PGMU propulsion system (MTU M53B generators) and the new Sea Ceptor air defence system, replacing the 1970s Sea Wolf system.

The ship deployed as part of United Kingdom Carrier Strike Group 21, alongside sister ship , travelling from the UK to Gibraltar, the Suez Canal, and the South China Sea in 2021.

In early September 2022, &quot;Richmond&quot; along with sister ships and tracked the , and the tanker &quot;Vyazma&quot; as they sailed near UK waters. In 2022, &quot;Richmond&quot; spent 145 days at sea.

In January 2024 &quot;Richmond&quot; was sent to the Red Sea to join destroyer and sister-frigate HMS &quot;Lancaster&quot; in defending against attacks on commercial shipping by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels based in Yemen, and on 9 March 2024 the Secretary of State for Defence announced that &quot;Richmond&quot; had successfully intercepted two attack drones.

<doc id="485753" wikidata="Q5634380" url="?curid=485753" title="HMS Somerset (F82)">
<text>HMS &quot;Somerset&quot; is a Type 23 frigate of the Royal Navy. She is the eleventh ship of the class to join the fleet since 1989. She was built by Yarrow Shipbuilders Ltd on the River Clyde, in Scotland and was launched in June 1994 by Lady Elspeth Layard, wife of then 2nd Sea Lord Admiral and Commander-in-Chief Naval Home Command Admiral Sir Michael Layard. She entered service in 1996. Lady Layard is the ship&#x27;s sponsor. She is named after the Dukedom of Somerset.

The fourth &quot;Somerset&quot; to serve in the Royal Navy, she has inherited four battle honours from previous ships of the name; Vigo Bay (1702), Velez Malaga (1704), Louisburg (1758) and Quebec (1759). The previous ships all served during the 18th century and ensured that the name &quot;Somerset&quot; played a significant part in that period of naval history.

&quot;Somerset&quot;″s home port is HMNB Devonport. The ship has the Freedom of the City of Wells and is also affiliated with the County of Somerset, the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries, the 2nd and 4th Battalions of The Rifles (inherited from affiliation with the Royal Green Jackets), TS &quot;Weston&quot; and TS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; Sea Cadet Units, Downside, Baytree and Helles Schools, Bridgwater College and the Somerset Legion House of The Royal British Legion. The 19th Duke of Somerset takes a keen interest in the ship and is a regular visitor, and the ship also hosted Harry Patch, Simon Weston (in place of Johnson Beharry) and Marcus Trescothick whilst docked at Avonmouth for a remembrance service to launch the 2008 British Legion Poppy Appeal.

==Operational history==

===1996–2000===
On 2 November 1999, Somerset returned briefly to Sierra Leone to stand by for a possible evacuation of British nationals during a breakdown in the peace talks, though after several days of the talks resumed and Somerset was withdrawn.

===2001–2010===
In 2007, the first at-sea firing trials of the UK Royal Navy&#x27;s new 30mm DS30M Mark 2 Automated Small Calibre Gun system were completed by &quot;Somerset&quot;.

On 18 February 2009, &quot;Somerset&quot; sailed from Devonport as part of the Taurus 09 deployment under Commander UK Amphibious Task Group, Commodore Peter Hudson. She was joined on this deployment by landing platform dock as Hudson&#x27;s flagship, landing platform helicopter , Type 23 frigate and four ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. In June 2009, she took part in exercise Bersama Shield with &quot;Ocean&quot; and off the Malay Peninsula.

In May 2010 she sailed for Operation Telic, conducting boarding operations and oil platform protection operations in the Persian Gulf.

===2011–2021===
On 3 May 2012, she began a refit at the Devonport Royal Dockyard operated by the Babcock International Group. The refit was expected to take nine months. She took part in Exercise Joint Warrior 2013. In January 2015, &quot;Somerset&quot; took part in the search for the crew of the Cyprus-registered cement carrier , which had capsized in the Pentland Firth.
On 23 April 2015, with the Border Force cutter , she intercepted the Tanzanian-registered tug &quot;Hamal&quot; in the North Sea about off Aberdeen, leading to the seizure of more than three tons of cocaine, believed to be at the time the single largest seizure of a Class A drug in the UK. In Autumn 2015, she carried out security patrols in support of the European Heads of Government meeting in Malta. In November 2015, &quot;Somerset&quot; visited Valencia - the first Royal Navy ship to do so in a number of years. While there, she met a delegation led by Juan Carlos Valderrama Zurián, the Central Government Representative for the Valencia region, and hosted a lunch to thank representatives of various Armed Forces charities for their work. In December 2015, she returned to port after performing guard duties at the 2015 CHOGM.

In March 2016, as the , a tanker and a tug entered the United Kingdom&#x27;s exclusive economic zone, they were intercepted and escorted by &quot;Somerset&quot;. &quot;Somerset&quot; was again tasked with escorting a Russian vessel in May 2017 when she monitored the &quot;Krasnodar&quot; as it transited the English Channel. &quot;Somerset&quot; was awarded the &#x27;Fleet Frigate Effectiveness Trophy&#x27; for 2017. A Royal Navy press release said; &quot;HMS &quot;Somerset&quot; has been awarded the accolade for being the most successful and versatile of all of the Royal Navy’s frigates, which are widely considered to be the workhorses of the fleet.&quot;

&quot;Somerset&quot; began a major upgrade in November 2018 and officially returned to service in March 2022.

===2022–present===
In August 2022, it was reported that the ship had suffered a &quot;major systems failure&quot; and had to be tied up in Rosyth for investigation and potential repair. However, pursuant to repairs, the frigate was then reported to have returned to sea later the same evening.

In 2022, &quot;Somerset&quot; spent 52 days at sea.

In January 2023, work began on installing Naval Strike Missiles (NSM) on &quot;Somerset&quot; to replace the Harpoon anti-ship missiles. &quot;Somerset&quot; was to be the first Royal Navy ship to be fitted with Naval Strike Missiles and the removal of the obsolete Harpoon racks and blast deflectors was completed in January 2023. However, reported &quot;persistent defects&quot; in the ship since she emerged from refit in 2022 forced her back into dry dock on three occasions. As of September 2023, she was again in dry dock with the planned fitting of NSM and the testing of other key systems delayed. The ship was reported to have returned to sea in October. In December, HMS &quot;Somerset&quot; became the first Royal Navy warship to go to sea with NSM. She reportedly suffered a further breakdown in February 2024 delaying both her return to active operations as well as the testing of NSM for deployment with the Royal Navy.

In September 2024, it was reported that the ship&#x27;s post-refit defects had been &quot;finally resolved&quot; and that in July she had returned to sea for a series of trials.

On the 22nd January 2025 the UK Defence Secretary, John Healey, announced that &quot;Somerset&quot; had been deployed to monitor Russian undersea reconnaissance ship &quot;Yantar&quot; following her passing through British waters in the North Sea.

<text>HMS &quot;Grafton is a [[Type 23 frigate]] formerly in service with the [[Royal Navy]]. She was the ninth vessel to bear the name, and is named after the [[Duke of Grafton]]. Ordered in January 1992, &quot;Grafton&quot; was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 13 May 1993 by [[Yarrow Shipbuilders]]. The frigate was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 5 November 1994 and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the Royal Navy on 29 May 1997 with the [[pennant number]] F80. In 2007 the ship was transferred to Chile as Almirante Lynch&quot; and, having undergone a significant upgrade from 2019 to 2020, remains in service with the Chilean Navy.

==Design==
Designed to replace the , the Type 23 frigate&#x27;s operational role as an anti-submarine warfare platform. They are long with a beam of , a draught of and displaces 4,900 tonnes.

They are propelled by a combined diesel-electric and gas (CODLAG) system with two Rolls-Royce Spey boost gas turbines and four Paxman Valenta diesel engines. They are also equipped with two GEC electric motors. This gives the ships a maximum speed of and on diesel-electric. The vessels have an effective range of at 15 knots.

=== Armament ===
Designed to replace the &quot;Leander&quot; class, the Type 23 frigate&#x27;s operational role as an anti-submarine warfare platform. The design grew to encompass the Sea Wolf and Harpoon missile systems for air defence and anti-ship purposes respectively. They were also equipped with one BAE 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mk 8 gun.

For anti-submarine purposes they have four Sting Ray torpedo tubes. For anti-missile defence they have Seagnat and DFL3 decoy launchers.

==Service history==
===Royal Navy service===
On 23 September 1998, while operating off the coast of Malaysia, &quot;Grafton&quot;″s Lynx helicopter crashed into the sea during a night exercise, one crew member was killed.

In 2003, the ship was used in the ITV drama series &quot;Making Waves&quot; as the fictional Royal Navy warship &quot;Suffolk&quot;. In early 2004 the ship was deployed in the Persian Gulf. In July 2004, it was announced that &quot;Grafton&quot; would be one of three Type 23 frigates to be decommissioned by the end of 2006.

In June 2005, it was announced that &quot;Grafton&quot; would be sold to the Chilean Navy . During her service in the Royal Navy, her crew were awarded the freedom of the Borough of Ipswich, due to their frequent visits to the Suffolk town. On her last visit to Ipswich in 2006, the ship&#x27;s bell was presented to the town as a permanent reminder of the links between &quot;Grafton&quot; and Ipswich. The bell is now on display in the reception area of the Ipswich Borough Council offices at Grafton House, named for the connection to the warship. She was decommissioned on 31 March 2006.

===Chilean naval service===
The frigate was delivered to Chilean Navy on 28 March 2007 at Portsmouth and renamed &quot;Almirante Lynch&quot; (FF-07) after Patricio Lynch.

Along with other Chilean vessels of her class, &quot;Almirante Lynch&quot; underwent a significant upgrade from June 2019 to December 2020. The CMS 330 combat management architecture was installed along TRS-4D G-Band active scanning radars and 32 CAMM Sea Ceptor vertical-launch surface-to-air missile silos to replace the previous Sea Wolf SAM system.

&quot;Almirante Lynch&quot; participated in the multinational military exercise RIMPAC 2022.

<doc id="485755" wikidata="Q5634528" url="?curid=485755" title="HMS Sutherland (F81)">
<text>HMS &quot;Sutherland&quot; is a Type 23 frigate of the British Royal Navy. She is the thirteenth ship in the Duke class of frigates and is the third ship to bear the name, more than 200 years since the name was last used.

She was launched in 1996 by Lady Christina Walmsley, wife of Sir Robert Walmsley. Before this occasion, Royal Navy ships had always been launched with a bottle of champagne, but Lady Walmsley broke with tradition and used a bottle of Macallan Scotch whisky.

==Operational history==

===1997–2000===
&quot;Sutherland&quot; was deployed to the Falkland Islands in the late 1998/ early 1999. In 2000, she was part of the task force NTG2000, the first time Royal Navy ships have circumnavigated the globe since 1986.

===2001–2010===
HMS Surtherland was on active operations during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, primarily in the escort role. HMS Sutherland most notably provided a rear-guard naval escort to oil tankers in the Persian Gulf, monitored Iranian forces in south-west Iran and provided support to amphibious landing forces during the Invasion of the Al-Faw peninsula. After berthing at Invergordon, HMS &quot;Sutherland&quot; was granted the freedom of the county of Sutherland at a ceremony in Dornoch on 18 September 2004. A subsequent visit to Invergordon in March 2011 was cut short, with &quot;operational commitments&quot; as the given reason. This was eventually revealed as her deployment as part of the UK Response Force Task Group&#x27;s (RFTG) first deployment, named COUGAR 11. She returned to Invergordon in April 2013.

===2011–2020===
In May 2011, she made a port visit to Patras, Greece, following participation in military exercises off Crete, after which she became involved in the operations off the Libyan coast. On 16 June 2011, &quot;Sutherland&quot; visited Souda Bay in Crete to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Crete, before sailing to Kalamata in Greece to conduct further World War II memorials. On 24 July 2011, &quot;Sutherland&quot; returned to the coast of Libya as part of Operation Ellamy. On 18 October 2011, &quot;Sutherland&quot; passed through Tower Bridge in London and docked next to , returning through the bridge on 22 October 2011.

In 2012, she was part of the COUGAR 12 task group.
She took part in Exercise Joint Warrior 2013.

&quot;Sutherland&quot; to part in 2016 Exercise Griffin Strike, a UK-French combined exercise. &quot;Sutherland&quot; escorted the through the English Channel in May 2016.
In April 2017, &quot;Sutherland&quot; was again tasked with escorting Russian warships in the English Channel, on this occasion, the s, and .

&quot;Sutherland&quot; was the first vessel assigned to escort the aircraft carrier when she embarked on sea trials in June 2017.

In 2018 &quot;Sutherland&quot; had a deployment to the Pacific Ocean. Part of her mission was &quot;to continue the pressure campaign on North Korea&quot;, and on her return traveled through the South China Sea to assert navigation rights against Chinese claims.

Early in 2019 she served as a testbed for an integrated mount for the Martlet LMM and 30 mm cannon, successfully engaging in firing operations against a motorboat-sized target at the Aberporth range in Wales.

===2021–present===
In April 2021, &quot;Sutherland&quot; entered long-term refit to incorporate Sea Ceptor SAMs as well as other system updates. The frigate was reported to have been removed from dry dock in March 2024, it being anticipated that she will begin post-refit sea trials later in the year.

<text>HMS &quot;Kent&quot; is a Type 23 Duke-class frigate of the Royal Navy, and the twelfth ship to bear the name, although formally she is named after the dukedom rather than the county. Sponsored by Princess Alexandra, The Hon. Lady Ogilvy (daughter of the late Prince George, Duke of Kent), &quot;Kent&quot; was launched on 28 May 1998 and commissioned on 8 June 2000 under the command of then Commander John Clink. She was the first ship to enter Royal Navy service in the 21st century and the first Royal Navy warship with a female Executive Officer, Lt Cdr Vanessa Jane Spiller, appointed in April 2001.

&quot;Kent&quot;″s lineage boasts sixteen Battle Honours from the three given to the first &quot;Kent&quot; of 46 guns built in 1653, to the five awarded to the ninth and tenth &quot;Kent&quot;s of World War I and World War II.

Aboard were a BBC film crew and four of HMS &quot;Exeter&quot;″s veteran survivors (photo below), one of the divers involved in the discovery of the wreck, (who, representing the other three discovery team members, and as part of the memorial service, handed over to the four survivors the Royal Navy Ensign they had &#x27;flown&#x27; on the wreck during their discovery dives in February 2007), along with several British dignitaries and high ranking naval officers.

In June 2010, &quot;Kent&quot; was sent on a mission to Sweden. The celebration of the official Queen&#x27;s Birthday Party was held on board the British warship in Gothenburg harbour, the first time that the event has been held outside Stockholm. After a stop at Hanö island where tribute was paid to the fifteen British sailors who rest there, &quot;Kent&quot; then continued to Stockholm to join the celebrations for the Wedding of Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and Daniel Westling.

&quot;Portland&quot; spent 2012 at Rosyth in a 50-week refit that saw her upgraded with Sonar 2087, new IT systems, Sea Wolf mid-life overhaul, gun replacements, galley refurbishment and accommodation improvements. She left Rosyth on 14 December 2012 for three months of sea trials.
In August 2013, she was announced as the Fleet Ready Escort for the next two months. She participated in Exercise Joint Warrior 2013.

On 2 August 2014, she completed the 7-month task of the Atlantic Patrol ship.

On 20 June 2016, &quot;Portland&quot; departed Devonport for a nine-month patrol covering the Middle East and the South Atlantic Ocean. &quot;Portland&quot; was the last Royal Navy ship to carry Radar 996 and was the last ship to conduct a Replenishment at Sea with prior to the latter ship&#x27;s decommissioning

In 2018, &quot;Portland&quot; began a Life Extension (LIFEX) refit at Babcock&#x27;s Frigate Support Centre in Devonport. Her refit included the installation of the Sea Ceptor surface-to-air missile system, 997 surveillance radar, 1084 navigational radar and the 2150 hull-mounted sonar. She returned to sea in March 2021.

===2022–present===
In 2022, &quot;Portland&quot; spent 152 days at sea.

In 2023, &quot;Portland&quot; and USS &quot;Porter&quot; were present at Halifax&#x27;s fleet week, making it the city&#x27;s first international fleet week.

From February 2024, &quot;Portland&quot; participated in Steadfast Defender 2024 as part of the UK Carrier Strike Group.

<text>HMS &quot;St Albans&quot; is a Type 23 frigate of the Royal Navy. She is the sixth ship to bear the name and is the sixteenth and final ship in the Duke class of frigates. She is based in Devonport, Plymouth.

== Operational history ==
===2000–2010===
The ship was launched on the River Clyde on 6 May 2000, built by BAE Systems at Yarrows Yard in Scotstoun, Glasgow.

On 27 October 2002, before entering operational service, &quot;St Albans&quot; was struck by the P&amp;O ferry when gale-force winds pushed the ferry into the ship whilst secure on her berth in Portsmouth. &quot;St Albans&quot; suffered damage to the gun deck, the sea boat supports (davits) and the bridge wing. However, no members of the crew were injured. In 2004, Commander Steve Dainton RN took command and the ship was deployed on Operation Oracle duties in the Arabian Sea. In July that year the crew were granted the Freedom of the City by the Mayor of St Albans.

On 13 February 2006, &quot;St Albans&quot; departed on a six-month deployment to the Gulf region. She arrived in the region in early April, where her tasks included protecting Iraqi oil platforms as well as patrol duties in the northern Gulf. During the trip, she provided a diplomatic role by visiting 16 countries, including Algeria, Albania, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey and Lebanon. By 12 July 2006 she had completed her tour in the Gulf and had begun her long journey back to Portsmouth via the Suez Canal and the eastern Mediterranean. However, on the same day, the conflict between Israel and Lebanon began. As a result, the Ministry of Defence announced on 17 July that year that &quot;St Albans&quot; had been redeployed to assist in Operation Highbrow, the evacuation of British citizens trapped in Lebanon. She arrived in the area on 20 July and the following day picked up 243 evacuees from the dock in Beirut and safely transported them to Cyprus. After completing her role in the evacuation, she remained on operational stand-by in the vicinity of Beirut for a short time before being resuming her voyage home. The ship finally arrived back in Portsmouth on 18 August 2006.

Following the ship&#x27;s successful six-month tour, &quot;St Albans&quot; underwent maintenance. During this time, the ship received a new commanding officer, Commander Mark Newland RN. The ship stayed in British waters, participated in submarine training in the Irish Sea, weapon training off the south coast and visited Glasgow on 11 November 2006 to take part in Remembrance Sunday events.

From 5 January until 15 January 2007 the ship was open to the public as part of the London Boat Show. Following this, the ship conducted various training exercises and engineering trials in the UK. The ship&#x27;s crew then went on Easter leave before returning to conduct more training activities. In May 2007, &quot;St Albans&quot; entered a period of maintenance that lasted over a year, with her crew temporarily reassigned to other vessels for the duration of the work. The maintenance programme took place in dry dock, situated in Rosyth, with a skeleton crew of engineers supervising the overhaul of several of the ship&#x27;s systems. Their work included the installation of a new Type 2087 sonar system and converting the ship so that she could operate Merlin helicopters. The upgrade took 15 months and cost £15 million. The ship then returned to her home port of Portsmouth and was accepted back into the fleet in July 2008. The ship was then put through various equipment tests and training routines throughout the later part of the year.
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;St Albans&quot; left Portsmouth on 19 January 2009 to conduct maritime security patrols in the Mediterranean. The ship joined a NATO Task Group in the Mediterranean, protecting busy shipping trade routes. &quot;St Albans&quot; was also a part of the rapid-response NATO Response Force (NRF). The ship also visited ports in Majorca, Italy and Egypt whilst in the region. She arrived on the Clyde on 7 May 2009 at 1500hrs, heading for Faslane.

&quot;St Albans&quot; was deployed in the Persian Gulf until mid-2010. She left Portsmouth on 1000hrs on 1 February on a deployment including supporting international efforts in &quot;tackling piracy, illegal trafficking, and smuggling.&quot; Later in that deployment &quot;St Albans&quot; helped the Iraqi government &quot;protect their oil platforms, and provide security to ensure regional stability&quot;. After completing her tour in the Middle East, she visited Grand Harbour, Malta for four days in July 2010 on her way back to the United Kingdom.

===2011–present===

2011 saw &quot;St Albans&quot; become affiliated with the Marketors&#x27; Company in addition to the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers. The warship helped in the recovery of a diver who had got into difficulties near Salcombe on 26 March 2011, although the diver was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. On 1 July 2011, &quot;St Albans&quot; rescued 13 sailors off the coast of Oman from the stricken tanker MV &quot;Pavit&quot;, which had spent three days drifting in a heavy storm after losing power. &quot;St Albans&quot; used her Merlin helicopter embarked from 829 Naval Air Squadron to winch the crew to safety. The rescued sailors were later transferred to their sister ship, the MV &quot;Jag Pushpa&quot;. After operating in the Middle East conducting counter-terrorism and anti-piracy operations, having relieved the frigate , She returned to Portsmouth, via Malta and Lisbon, in December 2011.

In March 2012, &quot;St Albans&quot; visited the Pool of London where she entertained a number of her affiliate organisations and other guests before returning to her home port of Portsmouth to conduct exercises in the Western Approaches. In May, she visited Iceland, where the captain Commander Tom Sharpe and Britain&#x27;s Ambassador to Iceland Ian Whitting cast a wreath into Hvalfjörður, once a staging point for the Arctic convoys to the Soviet Union. After a return to Portsmouth, she sailed up the Elbe to Hamburg to take part in the port&#x27;s 823rd birthday celebrations. In June, &quot;St Albans&quot; visited the home of the German Navy in Kiel, joining in the huge maritime event attended by 50 countries, 2,000 yachts and pleasure craft and more than 5,000 yachtsmen and women. Before joining in the celebrations, members of the ship&#x27;s company, two platoons and the ship&#x27;s guard headed to a remembrance service and wreath laying at the Commonwealth Cemetery at Nordfriedhof.

&quot;St Albans&quot; continued her home duties visiting the Channel Islands and Holyhead with an extended tour visiting Stavanger, Oslo and Amsterdam. During this deployment she was the last ship to fire the Royal Navy&#x27;s 4.5&quot; Mk.8 Mod 0 gun off Stavanger. In May 2013 she was handed over to BAe Systems for a refit in Portsmouth Harbour, her home port, silently coached into C lock. She remained in dock until spring 2014 to be modernised for another 10 years. On 10 December 2013, Commander Catherine Jordan RN took command of the ship.&quot;&quot;

The refit was a mid-life upgrade, modernizing the ship for the following ten years – it cost £25million and was completed on time in spring 2014. It fitted her with the all-electric &#x27;Kryten&#x27; 4.5&quot; Mod1 gun and the mid-life upgrade to her Sea Wolf missile system together with a wide range of more detailed improvements. A new crew was then assembled and the ship undertook an extended period of trials developing her military capability and testing her systems integration. During the trials the ship visited Plymouth and Falmouth.

Passing the Material Assessment and Safety Check on 3 November 2014, &quot;St Albans&quot; was relaunched on 1 August 2014, before rejoining the fleet. In December 2014 &quot;St Albans&quot; visited London, mooring alongside in the Pool of London, and then sailed across the North Sea and down the Nieuwe Maas to visit Rotterdam.

Still based in Portsmouth, she continued trials in the Western English Channel and then visited Trondheim in Norway and continued live firing trials. After completing her extensive Flag Officer Sea Training trails, based at Plymouth, she entered West India Dock, London on 7 July 2015 and then sailed back to Portsmouth. She arrived on 16 July 2015 and became the Guard ship for the Portsmouth America&#x27;s Cup races later that month. &quot;St Albans&quot; sailed for a nine-month mission to the Middle East on 27 November 2015, carrying a Merlin HM2 and ScanEagle unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

Whilst crossing the Mediterranean she was involved with the seizure of of cocaine with a street value of more than £1 million. On 11 January 2016, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon announced that &quot;HMS &quot;St Albans&quot; will shortly join the &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; aircraft carrier group&quot; as part of operations against the Islamic State group. She arrived back in Portsmouth on 5 August 2016.

In January 2017 she escorted the along the English Channel on the latter&#x27;s return voyage from Syria to Kola Bay.

During February 2017 she conducted the Submarine Command Course off the Norwegian Coast and was then awarded the Fleet Effectiveness Flag. She then went into dry dock &#x27;C&#x27; in Portsmouth for most of July 2017. Whilst in dry dock, the band of the Royal Yeomanry played under the keel. She returned to service on 29 August 2017 and was operational north of Scotland where she was &quot;man marking&quot; the Russian carrier &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot;. From 23 to 25 December, she escorted the which was conducting sea trials in the North Sea close to UK waters.

It was reported in November 2018 that she took part in anti-submarine warfare exercises with .

&quot;St Albans&quot; entered refit in Devonport in July 2019, led by Babcock defence firm. Her refit required around 1.2 million working hours and involved replacing all four diesel engines, installing LED lighting, adapting the ship for the future anti-surface guided weapon system Sea Venom, replacing the original Sea Wolf air defence system with Sea Ceptor, upgrading the ships sensors with the new Type 997 Artisan air-search radar and fitting the submarine-hunting Type 2150 sonar in place of 2050. &quot;St Albans&quot; became the Royal Navy&#x27;s most advanced frigate, thanks to those improvements. The vessel returned to sea for trials in March 2024.

<text>HMS &quot;Broadsword&quot; was the lead ship and first Batch 1 unit of the Type 22 frigates of the Royal Navy.

==Construction==
&quot;Broadsword&quot; was ordered from Yarrow Shipbuilders on 8 February 1974 and was laid down at Yarrow&#x27;s Scotstoun shipyard on 7 February 1975. She was launched on 12 May 1976 and commissioned on 3 May 1979.

==Royal Navy service==
While on sea trials, &quot;Broadsword&quot; was called into service as the command ship during the large rescue operation required after storms struck the 1979 Fastnet race.

&quot;Broadsword&quot; took part in the 1982 Falklands War. On 25 May 1982, she was paired with HMS &quot;Coventry&quot; to draw Argentine aircraft away from the landings at San Carlos. If &quot;Coventry&quot;&#x27;s long range Sea Dart missiles missed, then &quot;Broadsword&quot;&#x27;s shorter range Sea Wolf missile system could engage aircraft (and missiles). Two pairs of Argentine aircraft attacked the ships at low level. &quot;Coventry&quot; was not able to achieve a missile lock on the first pair and &quot;Broadsword&quot;&#x27;s Sea Wolf system shut down. &quot;Broadsword&quot; was hit by one bomb from the first pair, which bounced up through the helicopter deck, hitting the Westland Lynx helicopter, before exiting and exploding harmlessly. The other pair of aircraft targeted &quot;Coventry&quot; which made a turn to reduce her profile—this took her into the line of fire of &quot;Broadsword&quot;&#x27;s Sea Wolf system, preventing &quot;Broadsword&quot; from firing on the aircraft. Bombs from the two Argentine Douglas A-4 Skyhawks damaged and sunk the &quot;Coventry&quot;. &quot;Broadsword&quot; subsequently rescued 170 of the sunken &quot;Coventry&#x27;s&quot; crew.
She shot down one IAI Dagger of FAA Grupo 6 and shared an Douglas A-4C Skyhawk kill with HMS &quot;Antelope&quot;″s SeaCat, land-based Rapiers and Blowpipe surface to air missiles.

Captain G W R Biggs commanded &quot;Broadsword&quot; between 10 April 1985 and 15 May 1986 and Commander M W G Kerr who commanded between 27 July 1988 and 18 May 1990 both subsequently became flag officers.

In 1993 &quot;Broadsword&quot; took part in the naval operation in support of Operation Grapple (Yugoslavia), in the Adriatic Sea. Upon completion on 8 July 1993, a fire broke out in the aft auxiliary machinery room which resulted in the deaths of two on-watch engineers.

By July 1994, HMS &quot;Broadsword&quot; was serving as the West Indies Guard Ship until she returned to the United Kingdom in March 1995 for decommissioning.

==Brazilian service==

In November 1994, &quot;Broadsword&quot; was sold to Brazil alongside her sisters HMS &quot;Brazen&quot;, HMS &quot;Brilliant&quot;, and HMS &quot;Battleaxe&quot; for £116,000,000. She was officially decommissioned from Royal Navy service on 31 March 1995 and entered the Brazilian Navy on 30 June 1995 as &quot;Greenhalgh&quot;.

&quot;Greenhalgh&quot; was the first Brazilian navy ship to integrate in a U.S. strike group in July 2008 during a Composite Training Unit Exercise (COMPUTEX) led by USS &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;.

On 10 August 2021, &quot;Greenhalgh&quot; was decommissioned from Brazilian service. On 13 September 2024, the ship was sunk as target during a SINKEX near Rio de Janeiro.

<text>HMS &quot;Battleaxe was a [[Type 22 frigate]] of the British [[Royal Navy]]. She was sold to the [[Brazilian Navy]] on 30 April 1997 and renamed Rademaker&quot;.

==Construction and design==
&quot;Battleaxe&quot; was ordered by the British Admiralty on 4 September 1974, as the second Batch I Type 22 Frigate. The ship was laid down at Yarrow Shipbuilders&#x27; Scotstoun shipyard on 4 February 1976, and was launched by Audrey Callaghan, the wife of James Callaghan, the Prime Minister at the time, on 18 May 1977. &quot;Battleaxe&quot; was completed on 28 March 1980.

&quot;Battleaxe&quot; was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was standard and deep load. She was powered by two Rolls-Royce Olympus TM3B gas turbines rated at a total of and two Rolls-Royce Tyne R1MC turbines rated at a total of , driving two shafts in a Combined gas or gas (COGOG) arrangement. They gave a speed of when powered by the Olympuses and when powered by the Tynes. The ship had a range of at .

Anti-aircraft armament consisted of two sextuple Sea Wolf surface-to-air missile launchers, one forward of the bridge, and one on the roof of the helicopter hangar. Four Exocet MM-38 anti-ship missiles were fitted on the forecastle. Gun armament was limited to a pair of Bofors guns, mainly for peacetime patrol duties. A hangar and flight deck was fitted aft, allowing the ship to operate two Westland Lynx helicopters, which could carry anti-submarine torpedoes, while close-in anti-submarine armament was two triple STWS-1 torpedo tubes.

==Operational history==
===Royal Navy===
&quot;Battleaxe&quot; was at Gibraltar on 24 March 1982, as part of Exercise &quot;Springtrain 82&quot;, but when the Falklands War broke out in April that year, she, unlike sister ships and , did not deploy to the South Atlantic as she was suffering from problems with her propeller shafts. &quot;Battleaxe&quot; did deploy to the South Atlantic shortly after the end of the war, however, escorting the aircraft carrier , leaving Devonport on 2 August, reaching the vicinity of the Falklands on 24 August and returning to Britain on 19 November. She was deployed to the South Atlantic again from July 1983 to December 1983. On 2 July 1988, &quot;Battleaxe&quot; rescued the stricken sailors from the yacht &quot;Dalriada&quot;, which had sunk after colliding with the submarine &#x27;s periscope.

&quot;Battleaxe&quot; was deployed on the Armilla patrol, the Royal Navy&#x27;s standing deployment in the Persian Gulf in August 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait. She returned to Plymouth in November 1990.

===Brazil===
&quot;Rademaker&quot; was involved in an unfortunate incident on 29 November 2004, during the annual FRATERNO naval exercise with ships of the Argentinian Navy. While conducting gunnery practice against target drones, a malfunction of the Argentinian frigate &#x27;s automatic weapons system caused her to fire on &quot;Rademaker&quot;; four Brazilian crewmen were injured together with an Argentine naval observer. The ship suffered moderate damage.

Also in 2004, &quot;Rademaker&quot; deployed to Port-au-Prince, as part of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. In April 2017, &quot;Rademaker&quot; was involved in the search for the missing bulk carrier after she disappeared in the Atlantic. &quot;Rademaker&quot; joined the international efforts to locate the missing Argentine submarine in November 2017.

<text>HMS &quot;Brilliant&quot; was a Type 22 frigate of the Royal Navy.

&quot;Brilliant&quot; took part in the only ship-to-ship engagement of the Falklands War, when she and chased the Argentine coaster &quot;Monsunen&quot;, in the Battle of Seal Cove.

==Royal Navy service==
===Falklands War===
&quot;Brilliant&quot; was part of the task force that took part in the Falklands War, with Captain John Coward in command. She sailed south with two WE.177A nuclear depth charges on board; to avoid complications arising from the Treaty of Tlatelolco, these were transferred to on 16 April 1982.

&quot;Brilliant&quot; was assigned to Operation Paraquet, the effort to retake the island of South Georgia. On 25 April her two helicopters, together with those of other warships in her group, disabled the Argentine submarine &quot;Santa Fe&quot; at South Georgia.

&quot;Brilliant&quot; was the first Royal Navy warship to fire the Sea Wolf missile in action when, on 12 May 1982, she shot down three A-4 Skyhawks.

On 21 May 1982, &quot;Brilliant&quot; came under Argentine air attack outside San Carlos Water and was lightly damaged by cannon fire. On 23 May she joined HMS &quot;Yarmouth&quot; in the chase of the Argentinian supply ship ARA &quot;Monsunen&quot;.

On 25 May she rescued 24 survivors from &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot;.

===1983–1996===
In 1987 she became leader of the 2nd Frigate Squadron. On 14 May 1989, the ship&#x27;s helicopter, a Lynx HAS3, &quot;XZ244&quot;, crashed near Mombasa, Kenya, while en route to the city&#x27;s airport for a period of shore leave. A door had detached when opened inflight and collided with the tail rotor, resulting in the aircraft splitting in half and the death of all nine personnel on board.

In October 1990 she saw the first members of the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service to serve officially on an operational warship. In January 1991, &quot;Brilliant&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of the Operation Granby Task Force, in the First Gulf War. &quot;Brilliant&quot; starred in a BBC documentary series called &quot;HMS Brilliant – In a Ship&#x27;s Company&quot; by the journalist Chris Terrill in 1994, while she was undertaking an operational tour off the coast of former Yugoslavia enforcing a United Nations arms embargo in the Adriatic sea.

==Brazilian Navy service==
She was decommissioned from Royal Navy service in 1996 and sold to the Brazilian Navy on 31 August 1996 and renamed &quot;Dodsworth&quot;.

F47 &quot;Dodsworth&quot; was sold for scrap and broken up at Aliağa, Turkey, during July 2012.

The silhouette of HMS &quot;Brilliant&quot; is painted, with the date 21 May, on the side of Argentine Air Force IAI Finger serial number C-412. Also painted on C-412 is the silhouette of HMS &quot;Arrow&quot; and the date 1 May. These kill markings (without crossing) have to do with damage to both ships in the Falklands War, HMS &quot;Arrow&quot; being slightly damaged by cannon fire 1 May 1982 and HMS &quot;Brilliant&quot; also being slightly damaged by cannon fire on 21 May. C-412&#x27;s markings were painted soon after the war; they were seen during the November 2005 multi-national Exercise Ceibo in Argentina.

<text>In the anatomy of the brain of vertebrates, the forebrain or prosencephalon is the rostral (forward-most) portion of the brain. The forebrain controls body temperature, reproductive functions, eating, sleeping, and the display of emotions. 

Vesicles of the forebrain (prosencephalon), the midbrain (mesencephalon), and hindbrain (rhombencephalon) are the three primary brain vesicles during the early development of the nervous system. At the five-vesicle stage, the forebrain separates into the diencephalon (thalamus, hypothalamus, subthalamus, and epithalamus) and the telencephalon which develops into the cerebrum. The cerebrum consists of the cerebral cortex, underlying white matter, and the basal ganglia.

In humans, by 5 weeks in utero it is visible as a single portion toward the front of the fetus. At 8 weeks in utero, the forebrain splits into the left and right cerebral hemispheres.

When the embryonic forebrain fails to divide the brain into two lobes, it results in a condition known as holoprosencephaly. The main structures of the forebrain include the cerebrum, thalamus and hypothalamus.

<text>HMS &quot;Brazen&quot; was a Type 22 frigate of the Royal Navy. She was completed three months ahead of schedule due to the Falklands War.

==Royal Navy service==
&quot;Brazen&quot; served on the Armilla Patrol which became a task force during the Gulf War as part of Operation Granby. For this she received the battle honour &quot;Kuwait 1991&quot;. On 24 January 1991, &quot;Brazen&quot; would screen the British Casualty Receiving ship when a pair of Iraqi Mirage F1 aircraft made a run for the vessel, armed with AM39 Exocet anti-ship missiles. The Iraqi aircraft were shot down by Saudi F-15C fighter aircraft before they could fire their anti-ship missiles. During the war, her Lynx helicopter attacked fast patrol boats.

Following a patrol in the South Atlantic &quot;Brazen&quot; ran aground in the Patagonian Canal on 11 September 1994. The ship was refloated four days later and taken to Talcahuano for repairs, which lasted a month. She then returned to the UK under her own power for reinstatement of combat system equipment damaged in the incident at Devonport royal dockyard.

By late 1995, &quot;Brazen&quot; was back in active service, operating in the Adriatic Sea as part of a Royal Navy task group led by the aircraft carrier for Operation Sharp Guard. In early 1996, &quot;Brazen&quot; rescued 30 Albanians from a sinking vessel. In May 1996, she returned to Devonport for the final time before being officially handed over to the Brazilian Navy in August 1996.

==Brazilian service==
She was purchased from the United Kingdom by the Brazilian Navy on 18 November 1994, and renamed &quot;Bosísio&quot;. The ship was commissioned into the Brazilian Navy on 30 August 1996.

In June 2009, &quot;Bosísio&quot; participated in the recovery mission for the wreckage of Air France Flight 447.

She was decommissioned from Brazilian Navy service on 23 September 2015. The ship was sunk as a target in July 2017 during the Brazilian Navy operation &#x27;MISSILEX 2017&#x27;.

<doc id="485770" wikidata="Q5631524" url="?curid=485770" title="HMS Beaver (F93)">
<text>HMS &quot;Beaver&quot; was one of 10 Type 22 missile frigates of the &quot;Broadsword&quot; class ordered by the Royal Navy.

The ship was laid down at the Yarrow Shipbuilders Ltd., Scotstoun, on 20 June 1980 and finally commissioned on 13 December 1984. Originally 22 ships of the class were planned to be built, but after the Falklands War, it was decided 10 was enough.

==Power &amp; Complement==
With a maximum displacement of 4800 tons and a crew complement of 273 hands, HMS &quot;Beaver&quot; had a propulsion of 54,000HP from 2 Rolls-Royce gas turbine Olympus TM3B and 2 Rolls-Royce gas turbine Tyne RM1C engines, a maximum speed of 30 knots and a range of 4,500 nautical miles.

==Armaments &amp; Equipment==

Armaments included:
*4 × Exocet MM38 missiles 
*2 Seawolf SAM missile launchers – 6 missiles per launcher
*4 30 mm GCM-A03 guns 
*2 20 mm GAM-B01 guns
*6 × 324 mm ASW torpedo tubes

On top of this HMS Beaver could carry 2 Lynx HMA 8 helicopters.

Other equipment included:
*Radar Type 1006 for navigation 
*Radar Type 967 / 968 for searching at air level
*Radar Type 911 for weapons guidance
*Sonar type 2016 for the bow
*Sonar type 2031 for towing from the stern

==Bolton&#x27;s Adoption==
HMS &quot;Beaver&quot; was the adopted ship of the town of Bolton. Despite being many miles inland the town has a proud naval tradition based on the fact that during one week in the Second World War it raised one million pounds for the Royal Navy. The sixth was officially adopted by the town during the war to mark this honour.

Prior to decommissioning, it was possible for Beaver Scouts to become honorary members of the crew.

==Decommissioning and fate==
On 1 May 1999, HMS &quot;Beaver&quot; was decommissioned and then sold for scrap on 21 February 2001.

<doc id="485771" wikidata="Q5631660" url="?curid=485771" title="HMS Brave (F94)">
<text>HMS &quot;Brave&quot; was a Type 22 frigate of the Royal Navy. She was built by Yarrow Shipbuilders Ltd, Glasgow, Scotland and launched on 19 November 1983. &quot;Brave&quot; was decommissioned on 23 March 1999 and was expended as a target in August 2004 by the submarine and frigate .

== First commission and trials ==
&quot;Brave&quot; cost some £250m to build and spent most of her first commission (1985–1987) as a trials ship. She achieved various firsts in her weapons and communications fit. Thus, from 1985–1987, &quot;Brave&quot; had a number of civilian military contractors&#x27; personnel embarked and Commander Coyote, the Seawolf trials mascot, became a familiar figure on board. She had a reputation as a &quot;happy ship&quot;. It was not until the autumn of 1987 that she undertook Basic Operational Sea Training at Portland and joined the fleet as a fully worked-up unit and she became leader of the 9th Frigate Squadron.

== Programme ==
Her programme from 1986 to 1987 included visits to Lowestoft, Gibraltar, Funchal, Madeira, Porto, London – alongside HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; in December 1986, Newcastle upon Tyne, Alicante and Torquay. In 1989 the ship was deployed to SE Asia and participated in exercises in the Gulf of Thailand with the navies of Australia (HMAS Darwin FFG04), Malaysia, New Zealand and Singapore. In January 1991 she was deployed to active service in the Gulf war. Whilst there she acted as the flagship for the Senior Naval Officer Middle East (SNOMI) commander of the sea-based task force. Her duties included providing anti-missile defense for US aircraft carriers and battleships, sonar tasks and mine watching. On a couple of occasions she came close to mines which had been dispatched by the Iraq military. Her main task during normal service was sonar patrols and between 1990 and 1992 carried out many successful patrols of the waters around the UK.

== Affiliations ==
She was at first affiliated to Waveney District and the port of Lowestoft, Suffolk; this followed from the last ship of the name&#x27;s Second World War association with the Suffolk town of Beccles. Other associations included the Royal Irish Rangers, the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers, the Algerines Association, and Sea Cadet and Combined Cadet Force units. She had also forged a liaison with the Mohawk Indians in Canada. TS &quot;Mohawk&quot;. Her final affiliation was with the town of Dover in 1996.

<doc id="485772" wikidata="Q1637905" url="?curid=485772" title="Romanian frigate Regina Maria (F222)">
<text>&quot;Regina Maria&quot; (F222) is a Type 22 frigate of the Romanian Naval Forces, formerly a Royal Navy ship named HMS &quot;London&quot; (F95). It is named after Queen Marie of Romania, wife of King Ferdinand I of Romania.

==Service==
HMS &quot;London&quot; was a Type 22 frigate of the Royal Navy, originally named &quot;Bloodhound&quot; but renamed &quot;London&quot; at the request of the Lord Mayor of London.

She was flagship of the Royal Navy task force during the 1991 Gulf War.

She was decommissioned on 14 January 1999 and sold to the Romanian Navy on 14 January 2003, being commissioned as &quot;Regina Maria&quot; on 21 April 2005. Before the sale the Sea Wolf and Exocet missile systems were removed, and the only armament the ship had when delivered was two 30 mm BMARC cannons and two three-tube anti-submarine torpedo launchers. The Romanian Navy had a 76 mm OTO-Melara gun system fitted forward where the Exocets had been mounted, but no missile systems or additional weapons have been fitted. There has since been some controversy over the price for which Romania purchased the ship.

Romanian authorities are currently working in collaboration with the Romanian to replace two of the Rolls-Royce gas turbine engines with two ST40M turbine engines designed at COMOTI.

==Commanding officers==
Notable commanding officers include Iain Henderson (1990-1991), Mark Stanhope (1991-1992) and Timothy McClement (1992-1994).

<doc id="485774" wikidata="Q4352656" url="?curid=485774" title="Chilean frigate Almirante Williams (FF-19)">
<text>Almirante Williams is a Type 22 frigate in service with the Chilean Navy. It entered service with the British Royal Navy in 1988 with the name HMS &quot;Sheffield&quot;, and served with the Royal Navy until 2002. Initially it was meant to be called &quot;Bruiser&quot;, but was named &quot;Sheffield&quot; in honour of the previous , a Type 42 destroyer sunk in the Falklands War. In 2003, the vessel was acquired by the Chilean Navy and renamed &quot;Almirante Williams&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Sheffield&quot; was launched on 26 March 1986, by Swan Hunter, Tyne and Wear, United Kingdom, and named by Mrs Susan Stanley, wife of the then Armed Forces Minister. The ship was commissioned at Hull on 26 July 1988. Several crewmen of the previous &quot;Sheffield&quot; were at the launch. A specially minted Sheffield coin was placed in the keel at the keel-laying ceremony on 29 March 1984.

In late 1998, &quot;Sheffield&quot; provided assistance after Hurricane Georges, visiting the island of St Kitts and also saved a Honduran woman who had been swept out to sea from her home by the force of Hurricane Mitch.

&quot;Sheffield&quot; was decommissioned on 4 November 2002. After 14 years service, which included providing humanitarian assistance to Nicaragua and Honduras after Hurricane Mitch (which earned her the Wilkinson Sword of Peace along with ), the Strategic Defence Review of 1998 (updated 2001) saw the end of her career with the Royal Navy.

==Chilean service==

&quot;Sheffield&quot; was acquired by Chile on 5 September 2003 and renamed &quot;Almirante Williams&quot; in honour of Vice Admiral Juan Williams Rebolledo, who was Commander of the Chilean Fleet at the beginning of the War of the Pacific.

Since its commissioning, &quot;Williams&quot; has served as part of the Chilean Fleet, where after various modernization projects carried out in the country, it serves as the flagship of this naval force.

She received a major refit in 2008, which saw her weapons fit change to:
* 1 x 76mm gun
* 2 x 20mm Oerlikon cannon
* 8 x Harpoon anti-ship missiles
* 2 x Barak 1 point defence systems
* 2 x triple 324mm ASW torpedo tubes
* Embarkation of 1 x SH-32 Cougar ASW helicopter

The new equipment was retrieved from decommissioned County-class destroyers.

The main roles of this unit, with its base port in Valparaíso, are the search and attack of submarines, surface combat and support in the event of catastrophes and emergencies. It also has the capacity to transport a Cougar helicopter.

<text>&quot;Regele Ferdinand&quot; (F221) is a Type 22 frigate of the Romanian Naval Forces, formerly a Royal Navy ship named HMS &quot;Coventry&quot; (F98). She was originally intended to be named &quot;Boadicea&quot; but was named &quot;Coventry&quot; in honour of the previous &quot;Coventry&quot;, a Type 42 destroyer sunk in the Falklands War. Following service in the Royal Navy she was sold to the Romanian Navy in 2003.

==Operational Service==
===Royal Navy===
Between 1990 and 1996 &quot;Coventry&quot; was the leader of the 1st Frigate Squadron. The ship received the freedom of the city of Coventry in 1988.

===Romanian Navy===

She was purchased from the United Kingdom by the Romanian Navy on 14 January 2003, and renamed Regele Ferdinand (King Ferdinand) after Ferdinand I of Romania. The ship was handed over to Romania on 19 August 2004, and underwent sea trials at the same time. &quot;Regele Ferdinand&quot; was commissioned into the Romanian Navy on 9 September 2004 with the pennant number F221, and is the current flagship of the Romanian Navy. There has since been some controversy over the price at which she was bought.

On 22 March 2011, President of Romania Traian Băsescu said, after a CSAT meeting, that Romania will send the frigate &quot;Regele Ferdinand&quot; with 205 mariners and two officers on board to enforce an arms embargo in the Mediterranean Sea, as part of the 2011 military intervention in Libya - Operation Unified Protector. During their run in the NATO naval group acting on Operation Unified Protector - 2011, the frigate has traveled over and carried out around 770 specific tasks.

Since entry into service of the Romanian Navy, &quot;Regele Ferdinand&quot; has performed a series of tasks among which the most important are deployments to Operation Active Endeavour in 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010 in the Mediterranean Sea, the exercise in Bulgaria &quot;Breeze -CertExam&quot; 2007, 2008, the exercise &quot;Noble Midas&quot; in Croatia in 2007 and 2008 in Italy.

Since 13 September 2012 &quot;Regele Ferdinand&quot; has participated in Operation Atalanta. The ship embarked naval commandos of Grupul Naval de Forțe pentru Operații Speciale (GNFOS).

In August 2014, &quot;Regele Ferdinand&quot; sailed alongside Standing NATO Maritime Group 2 Task Unit 2 which operated in the Black Sea as part of Exercise Sea Breeze.

In July 2019, the Romanian authorities announced the selection of Naval Group and its partner Santierul Naval Constanta (SNC) for the programme to build four new Gowind multi-mission corvettes and to modernise the T22 frigates.

Romanian authorities are currently working in collaboration with the Romanian to replace two of the Rolls-Royce gas turbine engines with two ST40M turbine engines designed at COMOTI.

While the ship type was designed to employ both Sea Wolf and Exocet missiles, as of 2025 Romania does not possess these two types of missiles.

<doc id="485776" wikidata="Q1558665" url="?curid=485776" title="HMS Cumberland (F85)">
<text>HMS &quot;Cumberland&quot; was a Batch 3 Type 22 frigate of the Royal Navy. She was launched in 1986 and commissioned on 10 June 1989. The frigate was on station during the First Gulf War and was part of the Devonport Flotilla based at Devonport Dockyard. &quot;Cumberland&quot; was decommissioned on 23 June 2011.

== History ==

On commissioning she became part of the 8th Frigate Squadron. Her first commanding officer was Captain Mike Gregory. Captain Gregory, a submariner, was previously awarded the OBE for the longest continuously submerged patrol in Royal Navy history.

The ship&#x27;s first two deployments were to the US and Canada, in 1989 and 1990 respectively. The first in 1989 called at both Fort Lauderdale and Baltimore where the ship became the focus of an anti-nuclear protest over suspicions that the ship carried nuclear weapons. In 1990, she again crossed the Atlantic to visit New York, before sailing North to the St Lawrence Seaway with a brief stop in Montreal followed by a 10-day visit to Toronto. This was followed by an unscheduled 24-hour stop in Halifax, Nova Scotia to repair some ship equipment damaged in bad weather, and then a visit to St John&#x27;s, Newfoundland.

She spent the winter of 1990–91 as the Royal Navy surface vessel patrolling the Falkland Islands. She sailed to South Georgia just before Christmas arriving at Grytviken on 22 December. She sailed along the coast of South Georgia and returned to Grytviken on Christmas Eve. On Christmas Day she hosted the soldiers of the South Georgia garrison aboard for Christmas Day lunch of venison. The stag had been shot the day before by a sniper from the garrison; part of the garrison&#x27;s duties being to control the deer population on the Island. While in South Georgia the ship manoeuvred into Cumberland Bay where a glacier sweeps into the sea. A photograph of the ship with the glacier as a back-drop was taken from the ship&#x27;s Lynx helicopter. Ice was collected from the glacier and kept in the ship&#x27;s freezers for use at cocktail parties during the return leg of her patrol.

On 26 September 2000, &quot;Cumberland&quot; worked with local fishermen to aid the rescue of survivors of the Greek ferry &quot;Express Samina&quot; which ran aground two miles off the island of Paros.

In 2003 &quot;Cumberland&quot; embarked two teams from M Squadron, Special Boat Service (SBS) and (in partnership with RFA &quot;Wave Knight&quot;) seized 3.6 tonnes of cocaine in the mid-Atlantic as part of an anti-drug operation. In October 2005 she intercepted and boarded a speedboat in the Caribbean Sea off Nicaragua from which they seized two tonnes of cocaine, and detained four suspects. The cocaine was estimated to have a street value of £200 million.

During this time Chris Cranmer, the first registered Satanist serving in the Royal Navy, was a technician on board the vessel. On 18 May 2006 &quot;Cumberland&quot; escorted Dee Caffari, sailing &quot;Aviva&quot;, across the finish-line (at Lizard Point) as she became the first woman to sail single-handedly non-stop around the world &quot;the wrong way&quot; (against the prevailing wind and tide).

&quot;Cumberland&quot; completed an 18-month refit in 2008.

In October 2008, &quot;Cumberland&quot; was assigned to anti-piracy duties along with 6 other ships as part of Standing NATO Maritime Group 2 (SNMG2). As part of her duties in SNMG2, on 11 November 2008, &quot;Cumberland&quot; went to the aid of a Danish vessel that had come under attack from pirates. The pirates opened fire on two of &quot;Cumberland&quot;″s launches; 3 pirates died when the Royal Marines returned fire on the dhow.

During her 2010 deployment to the Persian Gulf, &quot;Cumberland&quot; rotated between maritime security patrol duty and escort duty with the French nuclear-powered aircraft carrier &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; in support of coalition military operations in Afghanistan. This represented an example of interoperability pursuant to the recently ratified Franco-British defence co-operation treaty.

In February 2011, it was announced that the ship would be scrapped in April 2011 in a government spending review to meet UK government cuts to the MOD.

===Libya operations===
On 22 February 2011, British Foreign Secretary William Hague announced that &quot;Cumberland&quot;, while transiting the Mediterranean on her return to the UK for decommissioning, would be redeployed to Libyan waters to assist in Operation Deference, the evacuation of British citizens and other nationals affected by the 2011 Libyan civil war. &quot;Cumberland&quot; entered the Port of Benghazi on 24 February. The ship left the same day with an international collection of 454 passengers that included 129 British nationals plus European and American nationals, and transferred them to safety in Malta. All European Union citizens were entitled to rescue by the &quot;Cumberland&quot;, but needed to carry a passport or other document that could serve as proof of nationality; would-be passengers were advised to telephone the British embassy in Malta.

In March 2011, &quot;Cumberland&quot; took part in Operation Ellamy, the British role in the coalition action during the 2011 Libyan civil war by enforcing a naval blockade. The life of the &quot;Cumberland&quot; has been extended so that the UK &quot;armed forces remain equipped to protect in this conflict.&quot;

&quot;Cumberland&quot; was transferred to Operation Unified Protector under NATO command at the end of March.

==Decommissioning and disposal==

On 18 April 2011 &quot;Cumberland&quot; made her final entry into her base-port of Devonport from an intense and successful patrol involving oil production protection in the Gulf, counter-piracy operations, evacuating refugees from Libya and enforcing an arms embargo against the country&#x27;s ruler. The ship was decommissioned under the Strategic Defence and Security Review, with a decommissioning ceremony taking place on 23 June. She was laid up at Portsmouth and in July 2013 sold to Turkish company Leyal for demolition.

<text>HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot; was a Batch 3 Type 22 frigate of the British Royal Navy. Built by Cammell Laird in Birkenhead. She was part of the third batch of Type 22s, which were larger than their predecessors and incorporated advanced close-in weapons after lessons learnt from the 1982 Falklands War. She was decommissioned on 7 April 2011.

==History==
In August 2001 she visited Archangel, Russia for the 60th-anniversary of the Arctic Convoys. In company with Russian warships Zadorniy and Alexander Otrakovski. On 28 August 2001, as part of the same goodwill visit, &quot;Campbeltown&quot; laid a wreath in the Barents Sea close to where Russian submarine &quot;Kursk&quot; was lost on 12 August 2000.

&quot;Campbeltown&quot;″s last deployment was a seven-month tour from 2007 to 2008 in the Persian Gulf, where she operated in support of Operation Calash, a Counter Piracy and counter smuggling operation within the Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, and North Indian Ocean and Operation Telic, the security of Iraqi Territorial Seas. In early 2004 the vessel was deployed as part of NATO&#x27;s Standing Naval Force Atlantic. HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot; entered refit in September 2008.

The ship&#x27;s bell of the first , a Second World War famous for her role in the St Nazaire Raid, was loaned from Campbelltown, Pennsylvania to the current &quot;Campbeltown&quot; for the duration of her Royal Navy service.

==Decommissioning==
The Royal Navy announced in March 2011 that &quot;Campbeltown&quot; would be decommissioned on 7 April 2011. She paid a final visit to her namesake town of Campbeltown, Argyll in March 2011 where a series of ceremonies, including a town centre parade by the ship&#x27;s crew, took place to commemorate the end of the ship&#x27;s active service. &quot;Campbeltown&quot; made her final entrance to Plymouth on 31 March 2011 before decommissioning in a traditional ceremony on 7 April 2011. She was laid up at Portsmouth and in July 2013 sold to Turkish company Leyal for demolition. She was towed from Portsmouth to Turkey on 15 Oct 2013, arrived Aliağa on 29 October 2013.

The ship&#x27;s bell has now been returned to Campbelltown, Pennsylvania. The ship&#x27;s bell made specifically for the next , a Type 31 frigate, was given to Campbeltown, in Argyll and Bute, Scotland and will be displayed in the town&#x27;s museum until the new ship is commissioned.

<text>HMS &quot;Chatham&quot; was a Batch 3 Type 22 frigate of the British Royal Navy. She was decommissioned on 8 February 2011.

&quot;Chatham&quot; had the rare honour of a motto in English; &quot;Up and at &#x27;em&quot;, being the rallying cry of the Medway town football and rugby teams. The motto has subsequently been translated back into Latin as &quot;Surge et vince&quot;.

==Operational history==
===1990–1999===
&quot;Chatham&quot; joined Operation Sharp Guard to enforce the embargo against the former Yugoslavia in 1993. Her most notable action was on 1 May 1994 and the capture of the Maltese freighter &quot;Lido II&quot;, which was suspected of smuggling fuel to Montenegro. The British frigate assisted the Dutch frigate , who had forced the merchant to stop.

Three Yugoslav missile boats challenged the NATO operation and one of them attempted to ram &quot;Chatham&quot;. The corvettes were driven off by the actions of the British warship, supported by Italian Tornado aircraft which scrambled from an airbase at Gioia Del Colle. &quot;Lido II&quot; underwent repairs after sabotage to the ship&#x27;s engine room by her crew, before being diverted to Italy. The leaking was contained by an engineering party from &quot;Chatham&quot;. Seven Yugoslav stowaways were found on board.

Under the command of Captain Christopher Clayton, she was guardship to the royal yacht during the withdrawal from Hong Kong in 1997 (and served as the control military operations in the months prior to the handover).

===2000–2009===
In May 2000, &quot;Chatham&quot; was part of the Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) sent to the coast of Sierra Leone to oversee the evacuation of British, EU and Commonwealth nationals as part of Operation Palliser, under the captaincy of George Zambellas.

In March 2003 &quot;Chatham&quot; became the first British warship to since the Falklands War, when, as part of Operation Telic, she engaged targets on the Al-Faw Peninsula of southern Iraq. Approximately 60 rounds were fired at a variety of targets from her 4.5-inch gun. In company with , and she remained on station for the following 72 hours at immediate readiness to provide fire support to the troops of the Royal Marines as they advanced up the peninsula.

&quot;Chatham&quot; deployed from the UK to the Persian Gulf in January and returned in August. During the deployment, in the run-up to and the conduct of the invasion of Iraq, the ship spent around 90 days at sea continuously at defence watches in the northern part of the Persian Gulf. At times she came very close to hitting mines laid by Iraqi dhows and tugs in the shallow waters to be found in the area.

&quot;Chatham&quot; hosted filmmaker Chris Terrill of the BBC for the television programme &quot;Shipmates&quot; which charted the life of sailors in the Royal Navy. In the program, he filmed &quot;Chatham&quot; on active service in the Persian Gulf, whilst on an anti-terrorist mission. The show also covered the &quot;Chatham&quot;″s humanitarian relief efforts off the coast of Sri Lanka after the December 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami.

On 18 April 2005, &quot;Chatham&quot; sent a party ashore at Alexandria in Egypt to provide a burial for the recently uncovered remains of thirty British sailors and officers who had died during or after the 1798 Battle of the Nile.

On 31 October 2006, she visited the town of Chatham, Massachusetts, on her way to Boston.

In 2008 &quot;Chatham&quot; was responsible for the capture of six tonnes of the 23-tonne narcotic haul seized by the Royal Navy between January and August 2008. As of March 2010, she was the NATO flagship for international naval operations against Somali piracy.

===2010–2011===
On 17 May 2010, &quot;Chatham&quot; destroyed two pirate boats in the Somali Basin, forcing the pirates to return in the mother ship to Somalia.

On 20 May 2010 Cyclone Bandu disabled a cargo vessel, , and left her drifting off the Somali coast. Before the cargo vessel sank, 23 crew members were rescued by helicopters from &quot;Chatham&quot;.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
As a result of defence cuts, HMS &quot;Chatham&quot; arrived in Plymouth for the last time on 27 January 2011. The ship was decommissioned in February 2011. She was stripped of equipment and laid up at Portsmouth and in July 2013 sold to Turkish company Leyal for scrapping.

In autumn 2013, &quot;Chatham&quot; was towed to the Leyal shipyard in Turkey on her final voyage for breaking.

<text>The Type 21 frigate, or &quot;Amazon&quot;-class frigate, was a British Royal Navy general-purpose escort that was designed in the late 1960s, built in the 1970s and served throughout the 1980s into the 1990s.

==Development==
In the mid-1960s, the Royal Navy (RN) had a requirement for a replacement for the diesel-powered (Type 41) anti-aircraft frigates and (Type 61) air direction frigates. While the Royal Navy&#x27;s warships were traditionally designed by the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s Ship Department based at Bath, private shipyards (in particular Vosper Thorneycroft) campaigned for the right to design and build a ship to meet this requirement. Vospers claimed that, by ignoring what they claimed to be the conservative design practices followed by the MoD team at Bath, they could deliver the new frigate at a significantly lower price (£3.5 million compared with the £5 million price of the contemporary ), while being attractive to export customers.

The class was ordered under political and Treasury pressure for a relatively cheap, yet modern, general purpose escort vessel which would be attractive to governments and officers of South America and Australasia: the traditional export markets of British shipyards. It was also envisaged as an out-of-area RN gunboat that would retain UK presence in those areas, as well as the Caribbean and the Persian Gulf; essentially replacing the diesel-powered Type 41s and Type 61s and the combined steam and gas-powered Type 81 frigates with smaller crewed vessels. The RN staff disliked the idea and would have preferred to continue to develop steam types – in the RN&#x27;s case, the Type 12I &quot;Leander&quot; class, which was regarded as a successful and quiet anti-submarine hunter, but was seen by the politicians as dated and by the Treasury and export-oriented shipyards as too expensive to market.

The development of Vosper&#x27;s own export designs, the Mk 5 for Iran and the Mk 7 for Libya, increased the pressure on the Admiralty to accept this line of naval development, which seemed to offer a cheap export frigate with a range of , a top speed of , a superficially good armament of the new Mark 8 4.5-inch (113 mm) gun, facilities for a Westland Wasp helicopter, anti-ship missiles and two triple lightweight Seacat missile launchers. When plans for the new were finalised in 1968, the Admiralty board accepted that its paper specifications were unanswerable and they would have to allow the shipyards to develop a low cost fill in anti-submarine warfare and general purpose version for the RN that would be stretched and fully gas turbine-powered rather than combined diesel and gas like the Mk 5 and Mk 7. In reality, it was a much more difficult design, with the lack of heavy propulsion machinery low in the hull to balance the top weight of bulky superstructure. The fitting of Tyne gas turbines for cruising, instead of the diesels used in the Iranian and Libyan versions, meant fuel consumption and cost would be high, which was a tremendous problem for the Royal Navy in the early 1980s when the austerity of early Thatcherism cut the Royal Navy fuel allowance and meant that most frigates spent more time tied up, rather than at sea in 1980–1981; and despite the smaller crew, running costs of the Type 21 were ten percent higher than those of the &quot;Leander&quot;s.

The Type 21 would provide the shipyards with experience in building fully gas turbine powered ships and provide them with useful work for the shipyards while the Type 42 destroyer and Type 22 frigate would not be ready until the mid-to-late 1970s. As the Admiralty design board were busy with the latter, the Type 21 project was given to the private shipyards of Vosper Thornycroft and Yarrow. The unmistakably yacht-like and rakish lines were indicative of their commercial design.

At one stage, it was hoped to build a joint design that would meet both the Royal Navy&#x27;s requirement for a low-cost Patrol Frigate and Australia&#x27;s General Purpose Escort requirement, with discussions between the two navies beginning in 1967, with Australia, who hoped to build a series of Type 21s in Australian shipyards, part-funding design work on the proposal. The requirements of the two navies were significantly different, with Australia wanting higher speeds ( rather than the requirement of the Royal Navy) and American armament (including Sea Sparrow missiles and a Mark 45 gun). Australia pulled out of the project in November 1968, later refining its requirements into the Australian light destroyer project. After the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) DDL was cancelled the RAN and Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) reconsidered the Type 21 but still found it too expensive, and considered the UK gun and radar inferior to the United States Navy options. Australia ordered the US design in 1976.

A contract for detailed design of the new frigate to meet Royal Navy requirements and to build the first example was placed in March 1969. By this time cost had crept up to £7.3 million, more than &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates.

Attempts continued to sell frigates derived from the Type 21 to export customers, including Argentina. A broad-beam derivative armed with vertical-launch Sea Wolf surface-to-air missiles was offered to Pakistan in 1985.

The first of the eight built, , entered service in May 1974.

==Design==
These ships were the Royal Navy&#x27;s first privately designed warships for many years. They were also the first design to enter service with the Royal Navy to be solely powered by gas-turbine engines, with two Rolls-Royce Tynes for cruising and two Rolls-Royce Olympus for high speeds arranged in a combined gas or gas (COGOG) arrangement. The design had a large superstructure in relation to the volume of the main hull (below No 1 Deck) and made use of large amounts of aluminium alloy in the superstructure with the aim of reducing the topweight. However the design team miscalculated the weight of the ‘Outfit’ in and on the superstructure. The height of the superstructure exacerbated the error. Worries later surfaced about aluminium’s resilience to fire, particularly following a major fire on &quot;Amazon&quot; in 1977 during which aluminium ladders distorted, preventing fire-fighting teams from reaching the blaze, and its ability to withstand blast damage. Later British warships avoided aluminium for superstructure and load-bearing structure, and reverted to steel. 

As delivered, the Type 21s were armed with a single 4.5 inch Mark 8 naval gun forward, and a four-round launcher for the SeaCat surface-to-air missile aft. The Italian Selenia Orion-10X lightweight fire control radar was adopted to control both the gun and the SeaCat missile (as the GWS-24 system) in an effort to save weight. A Type 992Q air/surface radar was fitted, but a long-range air-search radar was not provided. A hangar and flight deck were provided for a single helicopter, at first the Westland Wasp. The CAAIS was provided to integrate the ship&#x27;s weapons and sensor systems and provide the crew with all the relevant information they required to fight the ship, as and when they needed it.

In terms of automation, systems integration and habitability, they were well in advance of many of the ships that they replaced, such as the Type 81 (Tribal-class) frigate and Type 12M - the latter&#x27;s basic design could be traced back to 1945.

===Modifications===
MoD discovered the error in weight and Vertical Centre of Gravity about 6 months after the first of class was launched. When they entered service, the Type 21s were criticised for being under-armed in relation to their size and cost. A programme was put in hand to increase their firepower by fitting four French-built MM38 Exocet anti-ship missiles. These were sited in front of the bridge screen aft of the forecastle, displacing the Corvus countermeasure launchers to amidships. This improvement was quickly carried out to all ships of the class during their build period except &quot;Amazon, Antelope&quot; and &quot;Ambuscade&quot;; Amazon and Ambuscade were fitted with Exocet in 1984/85. The Exocets were located in two pairs and the missiles would deploy across the ship and clear the opposite side of the vessel to their launchers in flight.

The design error in weight and stability had more than wiped out the margins that had been intended for replacing Seacat by the more capable Seawolf and the Type 2016 bow sonar. The ships lacked the margins of weight and space customary to in-house Royal Navy warship designs for major modernization.

Five modernisation proposals for the Type 21s were considered by the Royal Navy but rejected by 1979, when it was &#x27;reluctantly&#x27; decided not to modernize the class, and it was estimated that they would be laid up by 1988.

The small Wasp helicopter was replaced by the vastly more capable Westland Lynx when it became available. Compared to the Wasp, the Lynx was faster and carried its own sensors, plus more and better weapons. As and when ships came in for refit, ship-launched anti-submarine torpedoes were also fitted (though not in &quot;Amazon&quot;), in the form of two STWS-1 triple-tube launchers capable of firing United States USN/NATO-standard Mark 44 or Mark 46 torpedoes. After the Falklands War, two more 20 mm Oerlikon guns were mounted on some ships of the class, one each side of the hangar, to provide extra close-in armament. The first of these guns was actually salvaged from the wreck of &quot;Antelope&quot; by divers, and was fitted to &quot;Avenger&quot;, where it carried the slogan &#x27;Antelope&#x27;s Avenger&#x27; on its gunshield.

===Analysis===
Criticism was levelled at the performance of the type in the Falklands conflict. The ships developed cracks in their decks due to the different strength and fatigue properties of steel and aluminium. This was a vulnerability particularly demonstrated under the severe weather conditions that they encountered in the South Atlantic. Steel reinforcing plates were eventually fitted down the sides of the ships and on No. 1 Deck. Although built to a tight budget and design specification (and carrying insufficient anti-aircraft weaponry) they distinguished themselves in a theatre for which they had not been designed. As shore bombardment platforms and in lethal, accurate gunfire support for the Royal Marines and British Army landing at San Carlos, they were superb, pinning down any possibility of Argentine army counterattack, but they remained shallow water surface fighting ships, designed for Vosper&#x27;s export market to provide nations like Libya and Iran with the firepower to replace the United States/UK as western supporting stabilisers under the Kissinger/Healy strategy. The lack of margin to accept the Type 2031 towed array sealed the fate of the class.

The class was criticised for being overcrowded: at , they had 177 crewmen compared to and 185 crewmen for the Type 23 frigate. This was important at a time when the Royal Navy was facing a manpower shortage. However the standard of accommodation for the officers was better than the RN average and the senior ratings enjoyed separate cabins – unlike the petty officers of the Type 42 destroyer of the same era, who slept in bunk rooms. The ratings&#x27; accommodation was also improved, with four-man sleeping berths leading off from the communal mess deck; again, far better than those of the Type 42 destroyer. In essence, the standard of accommodation and fitting were better, especially for officers, because it was a design intended to attract export orders. Higher automation and the new Mk 8 4.5-inch automatic gun combined with an electronic fit meant that the Type 21 was in some ways simpler than that of the &quot;Leander&quot;s or Type 42. The Type 21 class lacked both the long range Type 965 radar carried by most UK warships and the Limbo mortar with its associated sonar.

==Service==
Except for HMS &quot;Amazon&quot;, all the class took part in the 1982 Falklands War as the 4th Frigate Squadron. They were heavily involved, performing extensive shore-bombardment missions and providing anti-submarine and anti-aircraft duties for the task force. On 10 May, HMS &quot;Alacrity&quot; and &quot;Arrow&quot; probed through Falkland Sound at night searching for minefields that might have impeded landings and operations, almost as expendable hulls. &quot;Alacrity&quot; engaged and sank an Argentine naval supply vessel in the Sound. On exiting the Sound at daybreak, they were attacked by the Argentine submarine &quot;San Luis&quot;, which fired two torpedoes; one hit &quot;Arrow&quot;″s submarine towed decoy (as intended) and the other bounced off her hull, having failed to arm itself. Two ships were lost: was hit by bombs dropped by Argentine aircraft on 21 May and consumed by fire; was hit by bombs on 23 May, one of which detonated while a bomb disposal team was attempting to defuse it on 24 May. The ship caught fire and set off her magazines, resulting in her breaking her back and sinking.

===Sale to Pakistan===
The six surviving Type 21 frigates were sold to Pakistan in 1993–1994 for 60 million US dollars. The Exocet and Seacat were removed before the sale and the frigates were given a basic refit at Karachi with US Harpoon anti-ship missile. Three of them were fitted with Phalanx CIWS, the others with 40mm Bofors L70 guns. The class was renamed by the Pakistan Navy as the , after the first vessel that was acquired, &quot;Tariq&quot;, formerly . Only two of the six remain in service: &quot;Badr&quot; and &quot;Babur&quot; were both decommissioned in 2014, while &quot;Tippu Sultan&quot; and &quot;Shah Jahan&quot; were sunk as targets in 2020 and 2021 respectively. By the closing years of the class the Harpoon was generally seen as slow and obsolete and in 2008 Harpoon was removed. The Pakistan frigates were given the Chinese 6-cell LY-60N Hunting Eagle surface-to-air missile system.

In 2010, like-minded former crew members decided that an association should be formed for former shipmates and officers who ever served on these frigates. It also includes Pakistan Naval crew members of the frigates now part of the Pakistan navy.

<doc id="485780" wikidata="Q4352844" url="?curid=485780" title="HMS Amazon (F169)">
<text>HMS &quot;Amazon&quot; was the first Type 21 frigate of the Royal Navy. Her keel was laid down at the Vosper Thornycroft shipyard in Southampton, England. The ship suffered a fire in the Far East in 1977, drawing attention to the risk of building warships with aluminium superstructure.

==Design==
The Type 21 frigates were intended as a class of general purpose frigates to replace the diesel-powered frigates of the and es, and to maintain the Royal Navy&#x27;s frigate numbers until the specialist anti-submarine ships of the Type 22 class could enter service. The contract for the design of the class was placed with the commercial shipbuilder Vosper Thornycroft, with the intent that the design would be cheaper than those produced by the Royal Navy&#x27;s own design staff, while being attractive for export buyers.

&quot;Amazon&quot; was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a maximum draught of . Design displacement was normal and full load. She was powered by two Rolls-Royce Olympus TM3B gas turbines rated at a total of and two Rolls-Royce Tynes rated at a total of in a Combined gas or gas (COGOG) arrangement, giving a speed of when powered by the Olympuses and when powered by the Tynes.

As built, armament consisted of a single 4.5 inch Mark 8 naval gun forward, and a four-round launcher for the Sea Cat surface-to-air missile aft, backed up by two 20mm cannon. A hangar and flight deck for a single light helicopter, intended to be the new Westland Lynx (although &quot;Amazon&quot; was first equipped with a Westland Wasp as the Lynx had not yet entered service). A Type 992Q surface/air search and target indication radar was fitted, together with a Type 978 navigation radar. Two Type 912 fire control radars (the Italian Selenia RTX-10X) directed the ship&#x27;s gun and the Seacat, while a Type 184M medium range search sonar and a Type 162M bottom search sonar (modernised versions of the sonars used on the &quot;Leander&quot;-class) were fitted.

Later ships of the class completed with four Exocet anti-ship missiles forward, and two triple tubes for United States USN/NATO-standard Mark 44 or Mark 46 torpedoes, but &quot;Amazon&quot; did not receive Exocet until 1984–1985.

==Construction==
&quot;Amazon&quot;, the first of her class, was ordered on 26 March 1969. She was laid down at Vosper Thornycroft&#x27;s Woolston, Southampton shipyard on 6 November 1969 and was launched by Princess Anne on 26 April 1971. Construction was slow, and &quot;Amazon&quot; was not completed until 11 May 1974, at a cost of £16.8 million.

==Royal Navy Service==
In June 1977 &quot;Amazon&quot; took part in the Fleet Review, of the Royal Navy at Spithead in celebration of HM the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee, while in July she carried out successful trials with the Lynx helicopter. In November 1977 &quot;Amazon&quot; suffered a serious engine room fire caused by a fuel leak when near Singapore. Ladders made of aluminium alloy melted in the fire, making it difficult to respond, which was one of the reasons why use of aluminum as a construction material for warships went out of fashion with the Royal Navy. From 1978 &quot;Amazon&quot;″s Wasp helicopter was replaced by a Lynx.

In December 1980 the ship struck a coral pinnacle off Belize. &quot;Amazon&quot; was the only unit of her class to not participate in the Falklands War, as she was in the Persian Gulf at the time, although she carried out a patrol in the South Atlantic in August–November 1982.

By the mid-1980s the surviving Type 21s were suffering cracking in the hull and so she was taken in for refitting, with a steel plate being welded down each side of the ship. At the same time modifications were made to reduce hull noise. Four Exocet launchers were also fitted in &#x27;B&#x27; position, the last of the class to be so fitted.

==Pakistan Navy Service==

&quot;Amazon&quot; decommissioned and was sold to Pakistan on 30 September 1993, being renamed PNS Babur. Exocet was not transferred to Pakistan and &quot;Babur&quot; had her obsolete Sea Cat launcher removed. Two quadruple Harpoon missile launchers were fitted in place of the Exocet launchers. Signaal DA08 air search radar replaced the Type 992 and SRBOC chaff launchers and 20 mm and 30 mm guns were fitted.

On 3 August 2011, a video surfaced on the Internet reportedly showing &quot;Babur&quot; brushing against the Indian frigate in the Gulf of Aden during the rescue of hostages on-board merchant vessel MV&quot; Suez&quot; in June.

After serving 22 years of military service, Babur was retired and decommissioned from service in December 2014.

<text>HMS &quot;Antelope&quot; was a Type 21 frigate of the Royal Navy that participated in the Falklands War and was sunk by Argentine aircraft.

==Construction and commissioning==

Her keel was laid down 23 March 1971 by Vosper Thornycroft in Woolston, Southampton, England.

Initial budget costs for this class were £3.5 million, with final costs exceeding £14 million. She was commissioned on 17 July 1975, and was the only unit of the class never to be fitted with Exocet launchers.

In 1977, she attended the fleet review for the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. At this time, she was part of the 7th Frigate Squadron.

==Falklands War==

=== Bombing ===
&quot;Antelope&quot; took part in the Falklands War, arriving in the area of operations on 21 May 1982. Two days later, while on air defence duty at the entrance to San Carlos Water, protecting the beachhead established two days before, she came under attack by four Argentine A-4B Skyhawks of Grupo 5. The first pair attacked from astern, with the flight leader breaking off his attack after one of &quot;Antelope&quot;″s Sea Cat missiles exploded under the port wing of his aircraft.

The pilot, Captain Pablo Carballo, managed to nurse his aircraft back to Rio Gallegos. The second aircraft on this flight pressed home his bomb run and put a 1,000-pound bomb in &quot;Antelope&quot;″s starboard side, killing one crewman, Steward Mark R. Stephens. The bomb did not explode and the Argentine aircraft was damaged by small arms fire. The second pair of Skyhawks attacked minutes later from the starboard quarter. During this attack, one of the Argentine jets, piloted by First Lieutenant Luciano Guadagnini, was hit by the ship&#x27;s Oerlikon 20 mm cannon before colliding with &quot;Antelope&quot;″s main mast and disintegrating. Guadagnini had released the bombs before being brought down, and one bomb penetrated &quot;Antelope&quot;″s hull amidships, but like the first bomb hitting the ship failed to explode.

&quot;Antelope&quot; fired a Sea Cat at what she believed to be a fifth attacker, but this was Captain Carballo, trying to establish if his aircraft was fit to fly. The missile missed, but passed less than from Carballo&#x27;s cockpit.

=== Unexploded ordnance ===
After initial damage control efforts, &quot;Antelope&quot; proceeded to more sheltered waters so that two bomb disposal technicians from the Royal Engineers could come aboard and attempt to defuse the two unexploded bombs. One of the bombs was inaccessible because of wreckage; the other had been damaged and was thought to be in a particularly dangerous condition. Three attempts by the bomb disposal team to withdraw the fuse of this bomb by remote means failed.

=== Sinking ===
A fourth attempt using a small explosive charge detonated the bomb, killing Staff Sergeant James Prescott instantly and removing an arm of Warrant Officer John Phillips, the other member of the bomb disposal team.

The ship was torn open from waterline to funnel, with the blast starting major fires in both engine rooms, which spread very quickly. The starboard fire main was fractured, the ship lost all electrical power, and the commanding officer, Commander Nick Tobin, gave the order to abandon ship. Tobin was the last person to leave the ship; about five minutes after his departure, the missile magazines began exploding.

Explosions continued throughout the night. The following day &quot;Antelope&quot; was still afloat, but her keel had broken and her superstructure melted into a heap of twisted metal. &quot;Antelope&quot; broke in half and sank that day. TV and still pictures of &quot;Antelope&quot;″s demise became some of the iconic images of the Falklands War and appear repeatedly in histories of the event.

=== Aftermath ===
Corporal Alan White received a commendation from the Task Force Commander, Admiral Sir John Fieldhouse, for his part in rescuing 41 crew from &quot;Antelope&quot; using a Mark 2 LCVP, one of four carried by the assault ship . The landing craft, Foxtrot 7, is now located in the Royal Marines Museum in Portsmouth, with detailed accounts from Corporal Alan White of the missions he took part in, including the landings at San Carlos.

In January 2002, a diving team from the frigate replaced the naval ensign on &quot;Antelope&quot;. The wreck is designated as a prohibited area under the Falkland Islands Protection of Wrecks Act.

<text>HMS &quot;Active&quot; was a of the Royal Navy. Built by Vosper Thornycroft, Southampton, England, she was completed with Exocet launchers in &#x27;B&#x27; position, the first of the class to be so fitted.

==Royal Navy service==
&quot;Active&quot; participated in the Falklands War, setting out from HMNB Devonport on 10 May 1982 as part of the Bristol Group, reaching the task force on 21 May. &quot;Active&quot; formed part of the main British
Fleet, well east of the Falklands during the day, while escorting supply convoys to San Carlos Water or carrying out shore bombardment missions at night. On the night of 13/14 June, &quot;Active&quot; shelled on Argentine positions during the Battle of Mount Tumbledown. HMS &quot;Active&quot; took part in five NGS (naval gun supports) at Bluff Cove, Fitzroy, Berkley Sound, Mount Tumbledown, and Port Stanley. By the mid-1980s, in common with the other surviving Type 21s, &quot;Active&quot; suffered from hull cracking. When the ship was next refitted steel plating was welded along each side of the ship to repair and reinforce the weak points. At the same time modifications were made to reduce hull noise.

When Hurricane Gilbert struck Jamaica and Grand Cayman, &quot;Active&quot;, supported by RFA &quot;Oakleaf&quot;, arrived in the area on 13 September 1988 to provided emergency relief, before leaving seven days later.

==Pakistan Navy service==

&quot;Active&quot; decommissioned and was sold to Pakistan on 23 September 1994, being renamed &quot;Shah Jahan&quot;. Exocet was not transferred to Pakistan and &quot;Shah Jahan&quot; had her obsolete Sea Cat launcher removed. Signaal DA08 air search radar replaced the Type 992 and SRBOC chaff launchers and 20 mm and 30 mm guns were fitted.

Her flag was sold on the BBC programme &quot;Bargain Hunt&quot;. &quot;Shah Jahan&quot; remains in service with the Pakistan Navy. Between 11 and 21 May 2008, &quot;Shah Jahan&quot; participated in Exercise Inspired Union, a multi-national exercises in the North Arabian Sea. Other Pakistani warships included the frigate &quot;Badr&quot; and the replenishment tanker &quot;Nasr&quot;, as well as the Pakistan Air Force explosive ordnance disposal team, and the American destroyers and .

&quot;Shah Jahan&quot; was sunk as a target on 12 January 2021 as part of a Pakistan Navy live firing exercise.

==Civilian connections==
&quot;Active&quot; was the adopted ship of the town of Burnley in Lancashire, North-West England. The ship and its crew were granted the freedom of the town in 1989. Part of the town&#x27;s inner ring-road between Westgate and the traffic lights at the Church Street junction with Colne Road is called Active Way. One of Active&#x27;s anchors is displayed at the Anchor Retail Park next to Active Way.

<text>HMS &quot;Ambuscade&quot; is a retired Type 21 frigate of the Royal Navy. She was built by Yarrow Shipbuilders Ltd, Glasgow, Scotland. She entered service in 1975. &quot;Ambuscade&quot; took part in the Falklands War of 1982.

&quot;Ambuscade&quot; was sold to Pakistan in 1993 and served their navy as until 2023.

==Service history==

&quot;Ambuscade&quot; was launched on 18 January 1973 by Lady Griffin, wife of the Controller of the Navy, and was commissioned at Devonport on 5 September 1975. During 1976 and 1977 her commander was Peter Abbott who subsequently attained Flag rank.

&quot;Ambuscade&quot; took part in the Falklands War of 1982, serving as an Electronic Warfare picket ship to the Task Force,
and taking part in several bombardments of Argentine positions. On 25 May &quot;Ambuscade&quot; was targeted by two Exocet missiles fired by Argentine Super Étendard strike aircraft. &quot;Ambuscade&quot; detected the aircraft at 30 miles and the missile launch at 22 miles, first with radar then visually, and fired chaff decoys in an attempt to confuse the missiles&#x27; seekers. Both missiles then locked on to SS &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; impacting her port quarter, and setting her on fire. &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; sank whilst under tow on 28 May. On the night of 13 June she fired 228 4.5-inch shells in support of 2 Para&#x27;s assault of Wireless Ridge.

On 27 April 1983, &quot;Ambuscade&quot; was conducting tactical manoeuvres with ships of the United States Navy in the Indian Ocean. During the course of the exercise, she collided with the guided missile cruiser , resulting in part of her bow being torn away. &quot;Ambuscade&quot; was laid up in Bombay for six weeks while a new bow was constructed and fitted. Whilst laid up, some of the crew performed as extras in the film On Wings of Fire. There was enough damage to have &quot;Dale&quot; dry docked when she returned to Jacksonville, Florida. &quot;Ambuscade&quot; was in collision with the trawler &quot;Ester Colleen&quot; in heavy fog off Torbay on 26 October 1983. The trawler was badly holed in the collision.

From November 1983 to February 1984, &quot;Ambuscade&quot; served as a West Indies Guardship. On 8 June 1984, &quot;Ambuscade&quot; went to the assistance of the schooner &quot;Stena of Sitoo&quot;, which had struck an object in the North Sea and been holed below the waterline.

In late 1984, suffering from cracking in her hull, she was taken in for refitting, with a steel plate being welded down each side of the ship. At the same time modifications were made to reduce hull noise and four Exocet launchers were added in front of the bridge.

In 1993, she was decommissioned and sold to Pakistan and recommissioned as PNS &quot;Tariq&quot;, and remains in active service.

In December 2021, it was announced that it was hoped that when decommissioned, she could be returned to the United Kingdom for preservation as a museum ship.

In February 2023, it was announced that the Royal Navy was backing the plan to return her to the United Kingdom and will be preserved in Glasgow.

<text>HMS &quot;Arrow&quot; was a Type 21 frigate of the Royal Navy.

&quot;Arrow&quot; was active during the Falklands War of 1982, where she provided naval gunfire support (NGFS) and rescued most of the surviving crew from HMS Sheffield. She was sold to Pakistan on 1 March 1994 and renamed PNS &quot;Khaibar&quot;.

==Background==
Built by Yarrow Shipbuilders Ltd, Glasgow, Scotland, she was completed with Exocet launchers in &#x27;B&#x27; position. During 1976-1977 her first captain was Commander Nick J Barker.

==Falklands War service==
During the 1982 Falklands War, &quot;Arrow&quot; was the first British ship to see action when she shelled Argentine positions around Port Stanley airfield on 1 May and the first to be hit by an Argentine Air Force aircraft, sustaining several cannon shell hits to her funnel uptake and other parts of the superstructure. She had one casualty from shell splinters.

On 4 May she assisted in extinguishing the fires and evacuating the crew of the Type 42 destroyer HMS &quot;Sheffield&quot;, which had been struck by an Exocet missile, rescuing 225 of the 261 surviving crew. &quot;Arrow&quot;″s captain, Commander (later Captain) Paul Bootherstone was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for this action.

On 6 May &quot;Arrow&quot; shelled Argentine positions around Fox Bay West Falkland.

On the night of 1011 May, &quot;Arrow&quot; lay at the northern end of Falkland Sound, the channel which separates West and East Falkland, whilst her sister ship HMS &quot;Alacrity&quot; transited it from south to north to assess if the channel was mined. &quot;Alacrity&quot; left the channel just before dawn and &quot;Arrow&quot; was waiting to accompany her back to the Task Force when the Argentine submarine , captained by Fernando Azcueta, fired two SST-4 torpedoes at a range of 5000 yards. One did not leave its tube; the other hit the towed Type 182 decoy.

On 28 May, &quot;Arrow&quot; provided naval gunfire support to the Second Battalion, The Parachute Regiment&#x27;s assault on Goose Green. She fired 22 star shells and 135 rounds of 4.5&quot; high-explosive, during a 90-minute bombardment.

&quot;Arrow&quot; remained in Bomb Alley (San Carlos Water anchorage) longer than any other ship while receiving temporary repairs to hull cracks by having Seadart lifting beams welded to her upper decks.

On passage east toward Fitzroy on the night of 5 June &quot;Arrow&quot; detected an unknown surface target close to the shore and fired three star shells over what turned out to be a UK Landing Craft Mechanised (LCM) which was then escorted to Berkeley Sound. These were the last Mk 8 Illumination rounds fired during the conflict. In early June 1982 &quot;Arrow&quot; gave supporting fire in the battles that led up to the Argentine surrender.

She returned home to Devonport Naval Base on 7 July 1982, welcomed home by the Red Arrows display team, with whom she had an association.

=== Argentine claim ===
The silhouette of &quot;Arrow&quot;, along with the date 1 May, was painted on the side of Argentine Air Force Dagger C-412 along with the silhouette representation of and the 21 May, implying a successful action against these vessels. These refer to damage which both ships suffered during the conflict, which may not have been caused by this particular aircraft. &quot;Arrow&quot; was slightly damaged on 1 May 1982, and HMS &quot;Brilliant&quot; was damaged by cannon fire on 21 May 1982 outside San Carlos Water. The aircraft was still bearing these silhouettes in November 2005 at the multi-national &quot;Exercise Ceibo&quot; in Argentina.

==Later Royal Navy service==
By the mid-1980s &quot;Arrow&quot; was suffering from cracking in her hull. Much of this had first arisen during the Falklands conflict, when engineers were obliged to weld steel plates and girders to parts of the ship where cracks were opening up in the aluminium superstructure. After the war, she was taken in for refitting, with a large steel plate being welded down each side of the ship. At the same time modifications were made to reduce hull noise.

In early 1985, &quot;Arrow&quot; spent 3 months as Guardship in the West Indies. The vessel continued in service until 1994, and was decommissioned and removed from the fleet on 1 March that year.

In July 1991, &quot;Arrow&quot; was returning from a deployment to the South Atlantic when it joined a US Coast Guard patrol boat in the Caribbean, and played a major role in an operation which resulted in the seizure of 1,500lbs of smuggled cocaine.

==Pakistan Navy service==

Following decommissioning &quot;Arrow&quot; was transferred to Pakistan and renamed PNS &quot;Khaibar&quot;. The Exocet missile system was not transferred to Pakistan and &quot;Khaibar&quot; had her obsolete Sea Cat missile launcher removed. A Phalanx CIWS was later fitted in place of the Sea Cat launcher. SRBOC chaff launchers and 20 mm and 30 mm guns were fitted. &quot;Khaibar&quot; remains in service with the Pakistan Navy, who purchased from the United Kingdom Government all six surviving Type 21 frigates of the eight originally built (two were lost in the Falklands).

<text>HMS &quot;Alacrity&quot; was a Type 21 frigate of the Royal Navy.

&quot;Alacrity&quot; was active during the Falklands War of 1982, where she sank a supply ship, survived Exocet-missile attacks and rescued men from the &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot;. She was transferred to Pakistan on 1 March 1994 and renamed PNS &quot;Badr&quot;.

==Background==
Built by Yarrow Shipbuilders Ltd, Glasgow, Scotland, she was completed with Exocet launchers in &#x27;B&#x27; position.

==Royal Navy service==
===1977–1981===
In 1977, &quot;Alacrity&quot; took part in the Fleet Review, of the Royal Navy at Spithead in celebration of HM the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee.
In 1980, &quot;Alacrity&quot; took part in a Far-East deployment. During a visit to Shanghai she was the first British warship to enter the Yangtse river since HMS Amethyst escaped in 1949.

===Falklands War===
&quot;Alacrity&quot; participated in the Falklands War, departing Devonport on 5 April 1982 and captained by Commander Christopher Craig.

&quot;Alacrity&quot; was slightly damaged by an Argentine bomb on 1 May 1982.

On the night of 10–11 May 1982 &quot;Alacrity&quot; was tasked to establish if the Argentines had mined the north entrance of Falkland Sound. While approaching Swan Islands, she engaged and sank the 3000 ton Argentine supply ship ARA &quot;Isla de los Estados&quot; with her 4.5-inch gun. The Argentine transport blew up after a hit ignited her cargo of jet fuel and ammunition. Fifteen crew members and seven servicemen (from all three armed forces and the coast guard) were killed, there were only two survivors.

As &quot;Alacrity&quot; left the channel just before dawn, her sister ship was waiting to accompany her back to the Task Force, when the Argentine submarine, Captained by Fernando Azcueta fired two SST-4 torpedoes at a range of 5000 yards. One didn&#x27;t leave its tube, the other missed and was heard to detonate after hitting the sea bottom.

On 25 May, &quot;Alacrity&quot; sustained damage to her bow, while rescuing survivors from the , which had been struck by two Exocet missiles.

===1982–1994===
As with the other surviving Type 21 frigates, &quot;Alacrity&quot; was suffering from cracking in her hull by the mid-1980s. She was taken in for refitting, and a steel plate was welded down each side of the ship.

In 1989, while deployed as West Indies guard ship, &quot;Alacrity&quot; was tasked for humanitarian relief on the island of Montserrat in the British West Indies after the island suffered devastation in the wake of Hurricane Hugo. The ship&#x27;s Lynx helicopter was the sole means of transporting aid ashore as the port was destroyed.

==Pakistan Navy service==

&quot;Alacrity&quot; was decommissioned and transferred to Pakistan on 1 March 1994, being renamed Badr. Exocet was not transferred to Pakistan and &quot;Badr&quot; had her obsolete Sea Cat launcher removed and replaced with a Phalanx CIWS. Signaal DA08 air search radar replaced the Type 992 and SRBOC chaff launchers and new 20 mm and additional 30 mm guns were fitted.

Between 11 and 21 May 2008, &quot;Badr&quot; participated in Exercise Inspired Union, a multi-national exercises in the North Arabian Sea. Other Pakistani warships included the frigate &quot;Shah Jahan&quot; and the replenishment tanker &quot;Nasr&quot;, as well as the Pakistan Air Force explosive ordnance disposal team, and the American destroyers and .

&quot;Badr&quot; was decommissioned in April 2013 by the Pakistan Navy.

<text>HMS &quot;Ardent&quot; was a Royal Navy Type 21 frigate. Built by Yarrow Shipbuilders Ltd, Glasgow, Scotland. She was completed with Exocet launchers in &#x27;B&#x27; position. &quot;Ardent&quot; took part in the Falklands War, where she was sunk by Argentine aircraft in the Falkland Sound on 21 May 1982.

==Falklands War==
On 19 April 1982 &quot;Ardent&quot; sailed from HMNB Devonport near Plymouth for the Falkland Islands. En route, she escorted task force ships that had left late, on their way to Ascension Island, arriving on 3 May and sailing on the morning of the 7 May. On 9 May 1982 while 700 miles south west of Ascension, &quot;Ardent&quot; closed to within 200 yards of the starboard side of the troopship and provided a gun power demonstration to the troops sailing south.

On 21 May 1982, whilst lying in Falkland Sound and supporting Operation Sutton by bombarding the Argentine airstrip at Goose Green, &quot;Ardent&quot; was attacked by at least three waves of Argentine aircraft. The air strikes caused &quot;Ardent&quot; to sink the next day.

===British account===
The first attack took place when a A-4 Skyhawk dropped two bombs at 16:00 Z (UTC), which straddled the frigate but both failed to explode.

The bulk of the air strikes began at 17:40 Z. &quot;Ardent&quot; was ordered to proceed west of North West Island along with &quot;Yarmouth&quot; to &quot;split air attacks from the south&quot;. A group of three aircraft, either Skyhawks or IAI Daggers, crossed the Falklands Sound from the west and then turned to their left to attack from the north east. Cannon fire and three bombs struck home as the Argentine aircraft pressed their attack from the port side. The only defensive weapons which reacted properly were the 20 mm AA cannons.

The Sea Cat anti-aircraft missile system failed to lock onto the attackers, who also outmanoeuvred the 4.5&quot; gun by carrying out their run out of its arc of fire. Two bombs exploded in the hangar area, destroying the Westland Lynx helicopter and blowing the Sea Cat launcher 80 ft (24 m) into the air before it crashed back down onto the flight deck, and the third crashed through the aft auxiliary machinery room but failed to explode. The aft switchboard was severely damaged, causing loss of power for some key assets, such as the main gun. The hangar was left in flames, and the crew suffered a number of casualties.

Still in full control of her engines and steering, but virtually defenceless, &quot;Ardent&quot; was told to head north, toward Port San Carlos. But at 18:00 Z five Skyhawks approached the frigate and dropped numerous free-fall and retard bombs. A pattern of two to four bombs exploded in the port quarter (aft), while an undetermined number of others which failed to explode penetrated into the ship. Some of the remaining bombs exploded in the water nearby, battering the ship and causing minor flooding in the forward auxiliary machine room.

The dining hall was shattered, communications between the bridge and the ship control centre were cut off, and the frigate lost steering. This attack caused many casualties, especially among the damage-control teams working in the hangar.

&quot;Ardent&quot; stopped in the shallow waters of Grantham Sound, the fires in her stern now out of control. With the ship listing heavily, Commander Alan West gave the order to abandon the ship. &quot;Yarmouth&quot; came alongside to take off survivors, and the crew was transferred to . At that time it was known that 22 men were killed. &quot;Ardent&quot; continued to burn throughout the night, accompanied by the occasional explosion, until she sank at 6:30 the next day, with only her skewed radar antenna on the foremast remaining above the water.

Able Seaman John Dillon was able to remove an injured sailor from the debris and, despite his own burns, got the man topside and into the water where they were both rescued. For his heroism he received a George Medal, one of three awarded for the war.

The last man to leave was her captain, Commander Alan West, who was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, and served as First Sea Lord from 2002–2006.

Within days naval divers removed her light AA guns for fitting to other ships and her foremast was used as a navigational warning and datum by her sister ship &quot;Arrow&quot; whilst she bombarded Goose Green.

The wreck is designated as a prohibited area under the Falkland Islands Protection of Wrecks Act.

===Argentine account===

====Air Force attacks====

According to the Argentine Air Force official website &quot;Ardent&quot; was the subject of two attacks from FAA aircraft:
* 14:00 Argentine time (UTC-3) by a lone A-4B Skyhawk of 5th Air Group. Four A-4B took off from Rio Gallegos at 11:30 UTC-3. After experiencing problems during the air-to-air refuelling, two aircraft were forced to abort and fly back to their base. Once over the Falklands Sound, the remainder Skyhawks chanced upon an unidentified transport ship – she was apparently the abandoned Argentine cargo vessel &quot;Río Carcaraña&quot; – which was attacked by one of the jets. The other fighter, piloted by the flight commander, Captain Pablo Carballo, dropped one dumb bomb on a frigate he found at Grantham Sound. He reported heavy anti-aircraft fire but returned safely. The bomb exploded on the stern. Carballo went on to attack &quot;Broadsword&quot; a few days later.
* 14:40 UTC-3 by IAI Daggers of 6th Air Group. A flight of two Daggers, led by Captain Mir González, was joined by a third Dagger returning from an aborted sortie. They headed together towards San Carlos, but were intercepted by a patrol of Sea Harriers vectored by &quot;Brilliant&quot;, and the attached aircraft was shot down over West Falkland. The pilot ejected and was recovered later. The two original Daggers successfully outran the British air patrol and entered Falklands Sound from the south. They discovered a frigate and dropped two bombs on her stern. They also hit the craft with their 30 mm cannon. According to this report, the warship responded to the attack by firing anti-aircraft missiles.
====Navy aircraft sortie====
* 15:01 UTC-3 three Argentine Navy A-4Q Skyhawks of 3rd Fighter and Attack Naval Sqd. hit &quot;Ardent&quot; with at least two bombs on the stern, a number of unexploded bombs which ripped into the hull, and several near-misses. These fighters usually operated off the carrier ARA &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot;, but this mission was carried out from a land base at Rio Grande. Navy aircraft used a dozen retarding tail bombs during the attack.

:During their escape they were shot down by Sea Harriers. The pilot who made the final run, Lt. Gustavo Marcelo Márquez was killed in action after his A-4Q was hit by 30 mm fire and exploded. Lt. Philippi, shot down by an AIM-9L Sidewinder missile, ejected safely; afterwards being sheltered by local farmer Tony Blake during the night he rejoined Argentine forces. Lt. Arca, with his A-4Q also struck by 30 mm rounds, bailed out safely after an unsuccessful attempt to land at Stanley. The pilot was rescued from the water by the Argentine Army Huey UH-1H of Captain Svendsen. Arca ejected at Cape Pembroke, two miles (3 km) from Stanley airstrip. The Argentine Naval Aviation applied the mathematical theory published in the book &quot;Monte Carlo&quot;, which stated that if six jets loaded with four 250 kilo bombs dropped them “in a row” on a warship, the possibility of impact was four direct hits. This would cause the ship to sink. It also warned that the attacking group of six jets would lose 50 percent of its aerial material, which also occurred, since the attacking naval group lost 50 percent of its aircraft (3 jets) with two pilots ejected and one dead.

<text>HMS &quot;Avenger&quot; was a Type 21 frigate of the Royal Navy. Built by Yarrow Shipbuilders Ltd, Glasgow, Scotland, she was completed with Exocet launchers in &#x27;B&#x27; position.

==Royal Navy service==

With the appointment of Captain Hugo White in 1981, &quot;Avenger&quot; became leader of the 4th Frigate Squadron. &quot;Avenger&quot; was a late arrival at the Falklands War, as she didn&#x27;t leave the UK until 10 May 1982, arriving on 25 May - a record for any ship involved in the operations, and a great distance to have covered in 14 days. The Rolls-Royce Olympus turbines of Type 21 frigates enabled them to maintain high speeds, but at the time the Royal Navy preferred this information not to be publicised. Avenger had averaged 28 knots and the Type 21s became nicknamed the Boy Racers. Captain White led &quot;Avenger&quot; in the Falklands War surviving an attack by an Exocet missile which it shot out of the sky with the 4.5 inch mark 8 gun on the focsle of the ship. Her divers salvaged a 20mm Oerlikon from the wreck of HMS &quot;Antelope&quot; which was remounted to increase her anti-aircraft capability, referred to on board as &quot;Antelope&#x27;s Avenger&quot;. She also assisted with naval gunfire support during the campaign.

On 11 June she was conducting naval bombardments of Port Stanley in preparation for an amphibious assault by British troops. She directly struck a house where civilians were sheltering, killing three Falkland Islander women and wounding several others. They were the only British civilian casualties of the Falklands War.

During the Falklands deployment, an alarming crack in the ship&#x27;s hull progressively worsened with the stormy South Atlantic weather. On return to UK, she was taken in for refitting, with a steel plate being welded down each side of the ship to eliminate the problem. At the same time modifications were made to reduce hull noise.

On 4 May 1983, HMS Avenger, and sister ship HMS Ambuscade, were on the Royal Navy &#x27;Armilla&#x27; patrol, a permanent presence in the Persian Gulf during the 1980s and 1990s. The Avenger&#x27;s commanding officer, Captain Peter Woodhead, was returning from a visit ashore in the ships Westland Lynx, (registration XZ249) when it suffered a tail rotor control failure and, nose down, plunged into the sea off Muscat, Oman. The Lynx helicopter never resurfaced from its entry into the sea and for a short time there was no sign of the aircrew or ship&#x27;s captain. As HMS Avenger approached the crash sight the crew observed some green clothed bodies breaking the surface on the water. When it was suggested to the Captain that a Westland Lynx helicopter from the Royal Army of Oman would be taking him and the other three crew members to the nearest hospital in Oman, he informed the medics &quot;there is no fucking way I am getting into that helicopter&quot;. Captain Woodhead and the three other crew members survived the incident, with Woodhead sustaining a non-life changing injury to his back.

After the war she remained leader of the 4th Frigate Squadron until 1986.

==Pakistan Navy service==


&quot;Avenger&quot; was decommissioned and sold to Pakistan on 23 September 1994, where she was refitted and renamed &quot;Tippu Sultan&quot;. She was the third ship to carry this name and remained in service with the Pakistan Navy as part of the 25th Destroyer Squadron until on 27 April 2020 she was expended as a target.

<doc id="485789" wikidata="Q4899195" url="?curid=485789" title="Between the Lions">
<text>Between the Lions is an American animated/live-action/puppet educational children&#x27;s television series designed to promote reading. The show is a co-production between WGBH in Boston and Sirius Thinking, Ltd., in New York City, in association with Mississippi Public Broadcasting, the distributor from seasons 1–10. The show won nine Daytime Emmy awards between 2001 and 2007. Although it is created by alumni of the fellow PBS children&#x27;s show &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;Between the Lions&quot; was not created by Sesame Workshop, nor was it produced with their involvement in any way. The show premiered on PBS Kids on April 3, 2000, taking over the schedule slot held by &quot;The Puzzle Place&quot; upon its debut, and ended its original run on November 22, 2010. This TV show was a companion piece to &quot;Sesame Street&quot; aimed at slightly older children.

==Premise==
The series focuses on a family of clumsy anthropomorphic lions operating and living in a large, busy library called &quot;The Barnaby B. Busterfield III Memorial Public Library&quot;, starring alongside characters such as Click, an electronic, anthropomorphic computer mouse; the Information Hen, who answers library calls; and Heath, a dinosaur who serves as the library&#x27;s thesaurus. The program&#x27;s format is intended to promote literacy and reading; in each episode, the lions introduce a picture book to the audience and read it. Some episodes have featured adaptions of well-known folktales or ancient myths or fables, while others have featured popular storybooks such as &quot;Click, Clack, Moo: Cows That Type&quot;, or shown the lions learning or benefiting from the lessons presented by the story.

The series often features an array of educational segments formatted each in its own distinctive style, particularly parodies of well-known media redesigned educationally for younger audiences or simple animations, some sketches more repetitive than others. A distinctive feature of the series is that it is virtually never set outside of the library, as it usually chronicles the lions&#x27; experiences within it. A subplot features a pair of pigeons named Walter and Clay comically infuriating a living bust of the library&#x27;s deceased founder, Barnaby B. Busterfield III, located in an upper section of the library, that is normally intended for comic relief.

After the fourth season, the series underwent a noticeable format change. Notably, the show consisted of two ten-minute shorts, each a condensation of an earlier episode, tied together and united around a theme. The series also began to focus on consonants instead of vowels. Old segments such as &quot;Magic Time&quot; &quot;Sam Spud&quot; and &quot;The Monkey Pop-Up Theater&quot; were replaced with new ones such as &quot;Joy Learno&quot; and &quot;The Flying Trampolini Brothers&quot;. Later episodes shifted away from the earlier focus on reading, and stories were just told to tie into the theme of the episode. Major characters such as Busterfield, Walter and Clay, Heath, and Martha Reader vanished from the show as well, despite still appearing in the intro.

==Episodes==

== Characters ==
===Main===
* Theo Lion is the co-owner/librarian of the library (with his wife Cleo), Lionel and Leona&#x27;s father, and Cleo&#x27;s husband with a scruffy attitude, loud gravelly voice, and large appetite. He loves to eat meat and devours it all in one second. He loves to joke but also has a powerful roar and is proclaimed &quot;the King of the Library&quot;. Theo has an unending love for storytelling and is always proud to show library patrons the best books available. He also has an blues-singing and guitar-playing alter ego, B.B. the King of Beasts.
* Cleo Lion is the library&#x27;s other co-owner/librarian (with her husband Theo), mother of the cubs, Theo&#x27;s wife and the family hunter. She loves to read to her cubs and use the stories to teach them important life lessons. She has the alter ego of a country lion singer, Tammy Lionette. Cleo&#x27;s hunting instincts also make her a good investigative reporter and she can track down any book in the building, regardless of genre. She also has a powerful roar.
* Lionel Lion is Theo and Cleo&#x27;s 7-year-old first-grader son. He loves to read &quot;Cliff Hanger&quot; books and always looks forward to the next one, much to Leona&#x27;s annoyance. Lionel can get flustered when his family embarrasses him when they are devouring their food or if he is reading a baby book to Leona, but he loves them just the same. Since Lionel is always so self-confident, he is often convinced he doesn&#x27;t need any advice or help with his problems, but he always ends up needing it after all.
* Leona Lion is Theo and Cleo&#x27;s 4-year-old daughter. Leona is curious about everything and is preparing to read as well as her brother, Lionel. Unlike Lionel, she is more in touch with her feral instincts and always practices her pouncing and hunting on her brother or her father. While Lionel loves Cliff Hanger books, Leona hates them because of how predictable and repetitive they are.
* Click the Mouse is a female computer mouse shaped like the rodent of the same name. Click is technically skilled in that she can drag and drop objects and characters into and out of books and websites. When a character needs her, they only need to call out her name (usually screaming if it&#x27;s an emergency) since she doesn&#x27;t mind helping others and will do what they tell her to do. Her only hindrances are, being a computer mouse, she must always stay connected to a computer and that she is vulnerable to computer viruses, as shown in one episode. Click vanished for a while after the fourth season, but returned in the last couple of seasons.
* Barnaby B. Busterfield III is a grumpy rock statue who is the founder of the library, which is named after him, and lives on the second floor. He is often left annoyed by the antics of Walter and Clay Pigeon. Being a bust statue, he cannot go anywhere, so the pigeons and the viewers are the only ones to whom he can address his complaints. He is annoyed when anyone calls him &quot;Buster&quot; and when the announcer pesters him. He has the ability to open the top of his head. Busterfield is absent after Season 4.
* Walter and Clay Pigeon are the two birds that live in the library&#x27;s dome with Busterfield. They conversely talk to and annoy him. Walter is the male pigeon and Clay is the female pigeon. Walter and Clay Pigeon are true urban birds, but let&#x27;s just say that they&#x27;re not the brightest lights in the sky——they manage to say complete sentences only with each other&#x27;s help and someone else&#x27;s help. (for example, the Pigeons say, &quot;We are going roller...uh...skating.&quot;). Walter and Clay are absent after Season 4.

===Recurring===
* Heath the Thesaurus is the library&#x27;s thesaurus who is literally a giant dinosaur (a sauropod dinosaur; Brontosaurus) as a pun on the word &quot;thesaurus&quot; or &quot;the saurus&quot;. He lives in the basement and often shows up unexpectedly when a character asks about a homophonic word or when a situation is called for one. He was voiced by Tyler Bunch (in a deep baritone voice) in Season 1 and Peter Linz (doing a loose WC Fields impression) from Season 2 onwards. Heath does not appear after the fourth season.
* The Information Hen is the library&#x27;s information specialist. Each time she appears, she gives information about the library and reading to various callers usually by telling a joke or singing a song. She appears in animated segments in Season 5.
* Dr. Alexander Graham Nitwhite (often mispronounced as &quot;Dr. &quot;, which he hates being called, by his duck assistant, Watson and sometimes by other characters: a regular routine has Theo and Cleo saying hello to &quot;Dr. Nitwit&quot; and when they are corrected (Nitwhite) they proclaim &quot;Right...&quot;) is a pelican scientist. In his skits, he announces to Watson that he&#x27;s discovered &quot;the only word in the entire English language&quot; with a certain letter combination (which is nearly always related to the lesson of the whole episode). However, his &quot;discoveries&quot; always turn out to be incorrect, as Watson inadvertently points out; as such, his nickname is rather apt. His name is a pun on Alexander Graham Bell, the creator of the telephone.
* Gus the Rabbit/Lenny Lizard is Lionel&#x27;s best friend who is on his school hopping team. He has a reading disability and is still learning. He was afraid to tell Lionel about his problem, but Lionel encouraged him to keep trying and ask for help when he needs it.
* Grandpa Lion is Cleo&#x27;s father, Lionel and Leona&#x27;s maternal grandfather and also the father-in-law of Theo. He visits the library in the episode &quot;Out in Outer Space&quot; and tells of his friend Ellen Ochoa, the first Hispanic American woman in Outer Space. Lionel and Leona even made a biography of Grandpa Lion. He was performed by Martin P. Robinson.
* Aunt Priscilla and Uncle Otto Lion are Lionel and Leona&#x27;s aunt and uncle who were told by Leona that they had 3 new cubs in &quot;But Mama But&quot; in which Leona visited in the episode. Aunt Priscilla and Uncle Otto would be Cleo&#x27;s younger sister and Cleo&#x27;s brother-in-law, the maternal aunt and uncle of Lionel and Leona, and the sister-in-law and brother-in-law of Theo Lion.
* Announcer Bunny is a rabbit in a top hat who acts as the show&#x27;s announcer. He has a microphone right next to his hat. He appears before the intro in the first four seasons, saying something like &quot;Announcer Bunny here! Don&#x27;t touch that remote, here comes Between the Lions!&quot;, at which point a preview of a clip shown in the episode plays and then it goes back to him, saying &quot;If you think that was fun, watch this!&quot; and in the episodes with two segments from Seasons 5-10, he appears to introduce the next episode. He also appears to introduce Arty Smartypants in his segments &quot;Magic Time with the Great Smartini&quot;, &quot;Four Words Without Any Assistance Whatsoever&quot; and &quot;Not as Smart as a Puck&quot; and also introduces other segments such as the segments with Bertice Berry (saying &quot;Dr. Bertice Berry with the [letter sound] in [word]!&quot;), Fred Says (in the later seasons (saying &quot;And now, a word from Mr. Fred Newman!&quot;)) and Monkey Cheerleaders (saying &quot;And now, it&#x27;s time for those magnificent Monkey Cheerleaders!&quot; while a megaphone appears in front of him before he says &quot;...those magnificent Monkey Cheerleaders!&quot;, that bit of which he says through the megaphone). On one occasion, he introduced the Heath the Thesaurus song, &quot;Ten Little Words&quot; (saying &quot;Heath the Thesaurus, Heath the Thesaurus, Heath the Thesaurus! I went to Announcer School.&quot;). In some episodes, after a segment with Clay and Walter Pigeon, he would appear to say &quot;Ha, ha, ha! Pigeons, Don&#x27;t you just love &#x27;em?&quot; In later seasons, he announced the funding for the show. The only time he ever appeared with the lions or in the Library was in The Goat in the Coat, where he appeared to translate for Sierra the Spanish-speaking mountain lion.

Al Roker, India Arie, Jasmine Guy, Ossie Davis (along with his wife Ruby Dee), Bruno Kirby, Denyce Graves, Larry King, Roma Downey, Vanessa Williams, and Jane Seymour as well as a few athletes have also made appearances to read words to the viewers, including basketball player Stephon Marbury. Joe Lynn Turner sang a few songs on the show. LeVar Burton also appeared alongside the cast in several PBS Kids promotional spots. In addition, characters from other PBS Kids shows have appeared in &quot;Between the Lions&quot;. Three cast members of &quot;Zoom&quot; (Rachel Redd, Kenny Yates, and Kaleigh Cronin) have appeared, teaching viewers how to read the word &quot;Zoom&quot;. Several &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Muppets made cameos in Season Two and in the &quot;Dance in Smarty Pants&quot; music video.

==Segments==
&quot;Between the Lions&quot; often makes wild parodies of (often children&#x27;s) programming. The title itself is a double entendre in that it is a play on the phrase &quot;between the lines&quot; and that many classic library buildings have two lions separated by the main entrance. Thus in order to enter the library, one must go &quot;between the lions&quot;. Examples of recurring segments:

The Monkey Pop-Up Theater: A monkey with blonde hair (monkeys are often featured as background characters or library patrons in this series) opens a pop-up book which presents a zany musical performance by monkeys who sing in operatic voices.

The Vowelles: Three colored lips with satin gloves and wigs perform vowel songs for an audience. In the first few seasons, Click&#x27;s hand would pick up the letters of a word from the book and transition them to their segment to establish the vowel and word family of the episode. The Vowelles are usually accompanied by Johnny Consananti and Martha Reader. In Season 1, the stage backdrop is not lit, leaving viewers to see only lips, and usually satin gloves and feather boas, and hair. In seasons 2–4, the dark stage background is replaced with a colorful silver background obviously revealing that The Vowelles are only three pairs of lips surrounded by wigs, and usually accompanied by satin gloves and feather boas, and the unidentified puppets in the audience are replaced with monkeys and Johnny Consananti is the announcer. Martha Reader and The Vowelles is a parody of Martha Reeves and The Vandellas, a popular Motown group from the 1960s.

The Word Doctor with Dr. Ruth Wordheimer: Dr. Ruth Westheimer portrays &quot;Dr. Ruth Wordheimer&quot;, a friendly therapist. Her two types of clients are:
* Monkeys who need help reading or understanding long or difficult words (they are having a &quot;Long Word Freakout&quot;).
* Words that are dissatisfied with their current meaning. (By replacing certain well-chosen letters, Dr. Wordheimer is able to give the word a new meaning and a new lease on life.)

Little Wendy Tales: In an animesque segment, a girl with black hair tied in pigtails reads the misadventures found in Little Wendy Tales when sitting next to her white cat Cuddly Kitty on her bed. In classic fashion, the dark-haired girl and Cuddly Kitty transform themselves into The Punctuator and Emoticon the Cat (a parody of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, among other anime clichés) and saves Wendy by means of switching around the punctuation, altering the scene in the process. She rereads the altered adventures after correcting the sentences.

Fun with Chicken Jane: A parody of the famous Dick and Jane books for children. In this, two naive children, Scot and Dot, place themselves in harm&#x27;s way. An intelligent chicken named Chicken Jane spells out an obvious solution to the problem. At the last moment, the children get out of the way and Chicken Jane gets hurt instead. The theme song is a parody of the old Alka Seltzer jingle. When the skit starts, Scot, Dot, and Chicken Jane come skipping down a dirt road to the jingle that goes &quot;Look, look, see, see, coming down the lane. Here comes Scot, here comes Dot, here comes Chicken Jane!&quot; When the skit is over, Scot and Dot headed back up the road (Chicken Jane limping along behind with an injured wing) to &quot;Look, look, see, see, going up the lane. There goes Scot, there goes Dot, there goes Chicken Jane!&quot;. In the Episode, &quot;Stop That Chicken&quot;, Chicken Jane once fell out of one of the books and ended up in several other books which are Colonial America, Sleeping Beauty, and Cook A Lot Like Me by Molly Stewpot (a reference to Martha Stewart). The very demanding chef Molly sees Chicken Jane and wants to use her in one of her recipes while ignoring what Chicken Jane is saying. The book is then swatted at in an attempt for Chicken Jane to come to life while jelly is spilled onto Molly in a defeat, and Leona succeeds in getting Chicken Jane back in her book.

The Adventures of Cliff Hanger: This common cartoon segment centers around Cliff Hanger, a lantern-jawed outdoorsman who is usually stranded hundreds of feet above the ground, holding onto a tree branch on the side of a cliff (hence the skit&#x27;s title). Each episode presents Cliff with a preposterous situation of some kind, which he attempts to use to his advantage by reaching into his backpack, pulling out what he calls his &quot;trusty survival manual&quot;, and following the instructions provided there. The instructions, though often highly unorthodox, usually prove successful, and Cliff briefly escapes from the cliff. But, inevitably, another highly unlikely incident sends Cliff back to where he started, hanging onto his branch once again. The cartoon then ends when the branch starts cracking as Cliff says his baleful catchphrase: &quot;Can&#x27;t... hold... on... much... longer!&quot; and the sun sets as a cliff hanger. This scene occurs at the beginning of the cartoon as well. Similar to cartoons such as Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner, these cartoon clips follow the same storyline; although Cliff never gives up on trying to get off the cliff, he never succeeds. Each segment begins and usually ends with a theme song sung off-screen by a formally dressed group of singers (flying by in a helicopter), singing &quot;Cliff Hanger, hanging from a cliff! And that&#x27;s why he&#x27;s called Cliff Hanger!&quot; Cliff attempts to attract their attention to his predicament by calling out &quot;Excuse me! Excuse me!&quot;, but to no avail. In one episode, he apparently succeeds at drawing their attention, and they rescue him, but it turns out he is simply dreaming. He once got off the cliff when he jumped on a whale&#x27;s blowhole and washed up on a beach in &quot;The Last Cliff Hanger&quot; and Lionel is upset about the last book, but eventually missed his cliff and, through a series of bizarre events (thanks to the writer, Livingston Dangerously), got himself back onto it. His name is a play on the media term &quot;cliffhanger&quot; which is often shown on non-Between the Lions episodes as &quot;to be continued&quot;. In three episodes &quot;Cliff Hanger and the Solid Oil Lamp,&quot; &quot;Cliff Hanger Meets the Sleeping Gypsy,&quot; and &quot;Cliff Hanger and the Sheep on a Ship&quot;, Cliff Hanger imagines he is in a restaurant eating steak, he is in a bathtub and a starstruck door. In another episode, Lionel&#x27;s friend Lenny, a lizard, introduces a similarly styled series of books called &quot;Justin Time&quot;, about a stereotypical explorer named Justin Time who relaxes in a hammock until an absurd scenario like those of Cliff Hanger occurs, forcing him to intervene to restore the calm, boasting, &quot;Couldn&#x27;t be more comfortable.&quot;, as opposed to Cliff Hanger&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;Can&#x27;t hold on much longer!&quot; He too used a version of the Survival Manual, called a Safety Manual, which is from his Survival Kit, a version of Cliff Hanger&#x27;s backpack and the same formally dressed chorus, riding in the back of a Pickup truck introduces him at the beginning of the story, singing &quot;Justin Time, he&#x27;s always saved just in time! And that is why he is called Justin Time!&quot; Then Justin rudely tells the singers &quot;Go away!&quot; just like how Cliff Hanger always gets their attention to his predicament. Ironically, Lionel disliked this series. One &quot;Justin Time&quot; segment was ever shown as it only appeared in one episode. In the series, the character Lionel is a fan of Cliff Hanger books, which his sister Leona thinks are pointless. But, even in episodes where she expresses hatred, she has shown respect for it, such as when she decided to help Lionel get Livingston Dangerously to write more books.

Gawain&#x27;s Word: A &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; spoof hosted by a knight with an American surfer accent, featuring two jousting knights charging at each other, each touting a speech balloon with half of a word which then became their respective names, then demonstrating the word. For example, one skit featured &quot;Sir Sh&quot; dressed in silver armor and &quot;Sir Ark&quot; dressed in gold armor. Then Gawain says, &quot;Blend on, dudes!&quot; when it is time to put the halves together. When Sir Sh bumps into Sir Ark, their speech balloons meld together to form the word &quot;shark.&quot; Then they react to the word, by running away from a hovering shark. Though the title of the segment clearly is a parody of the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skit, the two knights in the segment speak more characteristically like Bill and Ted from &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot; than Wayne and Garth from &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;.

Tiger Words: A pun of golfer Tiger Woods. Tiger is always seen participating in a spelling competition (modeled off a golf tournament), where he always misspell a word. While the crowd and announcer are surprised and dismayed at his error, Tiger corrects his mistake by using another tool in his pencil bag (using an eraser to fix mistakes in pencil, or paint to fix mistakes in pen, for example). Tiger correctly spells the word and wins the championship.

Sam Spud: Par-Boiled Potato Detective: A spoof of the Sam Spade detective stories, this segment portrays a par-boiled potato (voiced by Michael K. Frith) who types out the voice-over narration typical of film noir on a late night, making and correcting typographical errors that demonstrate word sounds. This segment makes heavy use of sight gags based on wordplay (such as the narrator referring to the entrance of a &quot;tomato&quot;—1930s slang for an attractive woman—who is revealed to be a real tomato wearing a costume; or a neon sign that blinks the words &quot;Flicker Flicker&quot; or &quot;On&quot; and &quot;Off&quot;). In most cases, the segments would end with a live-action child watching Sam Spud on television and calling out to his or her mother that &quot;there&#x27;s a talking potato with a hat on and no mouth!&quot; (or some variation), and the mother calling from offscreen telling her child not to worry and that it&#x27;s educational television, so it &quot;must&quot; be good for him/her. On one occasion, it ends with the mother saying that it is not nice to say &quot;dumb&quot;, after a girl was describing a pickle with a zipper.

The Un-People: A Mo Willems cartoon aimed at teaching kids their prefixes. The main character is &quot;young&quot; Monica Maxwell, a girl about 8 years-old who seems to have an inordinate amount of trouble with a group of rambunctious rhinos or other misfortunes. The segment always begins with the rhinos running amok (or other non-rhino related situations, such as when Monica marches down a street in a parade) usually in Monica&#x27;s house. The clever, resourceful girl somehow manages to subdue or round up the rhinos, for example, putting them in a zippered bag (not all these segments have relationship with rhinos.) And, all of a sudden, the evil Un-People come along and &quot;un-zip&quot; the bag, causing the rhinos to run free again and resume their rampage of destruction (or other misfortune not caused by the animals.) But when the crime-fighting Re-People appear, they &quot;re-zip&quot; the bag and the destruction of the charging rhinos stops, or other misfortune-quelling results. This segment is a parody of common superhero-themed cartoons such as the Justice League. There are at least two skits that did not feature rhinos—the &quot;undressed&quot;/&quot;redressed&quot; skit where a marching band is seen without clothes, only to get redressed in their outfits, and the &quot;unbuttoned&quot;/&quot;rebuttoned&quot; skit where Monica is seen playing in the snow, with her coat becoming unbuttoned and then finally rebuttoned.

Silent E: A sly criminal, Silent E, has the ability to make the vowel sounds say their names and changes the words without a silent e into words with a silent e, for example: he changes a cub (which resembles Leona) into a cube, a tub into a tube, a twin into twine and a can into a cane. In each segment, Silent E is carted off to jail by a policeman. Silent E then writes a note to the policeman, which usually reads something like, &quot;Sure do like that pin/cap you&#x27;re wearing! I would love to get a closer look!&quot; The policeman then remarks, &quot;Well, sure! I don&#x27;t see any harm in that!&quot; The policeman hands the object to Silent E, who then easily escapes by using either the policeman&#x27;s pin and turning it into a pine to climb out the window or the policeman&#x27;s cap and turning it into a cape to fly out the window. Either way, after that, the policeman shouts, &quot;Well, Silent E, you may have slipped out of my grasp this time, but mark my words: I&#x27;ll get you YET!!!!&quot;

Dr. Nitwhite: This sketch usually begins with Dr. Nitwhite ordering in his assistant, Watson (the character most guilty of calling him &quot;Dr. Nitwit&quot;), for Nitwhite claims he has discovered &quot;the only word in the &quot;entire English language!&quot;&quot; with a particular letter combination in it, showing extreme pride in his achievement. Unfortunately for Nitwhite, Watson casually utters an expression or sentence containing another word with that same combination (for example, in one sketch, Nitwhite proudly presents what he claims to be the only two-letter word with the short &#x27;I&#x27; sound: in. An impressed Watson remarks, &quot;Dr. Nitwhite! This time, I think you have really done it!&quot;). After Nitwhite realizes this, he breaks down and advises Watson to leave, which the latter does, calling him &quot;Dr. Nitwit&quot; once more.

Vowel Boot Camp: In this segment, the soldiers, who are lowercase vowels (except the drill sergeant, who is an exclamation point and is revealed to be aptly named Sergeant Mark in one sketch), practice making their sounds and then go out to make words. The famous catchphrase is &quot;This isn&#x27;t &#x27;Camp [name]&#x27;, this is Vowel Boot Camp!&quot; In three skits, the lowercase &quot;I&quot; soldier is seen missing a dot before being corrected by the drill instructor, the &quot;U&quot; soldier is seen upside down, looking like a lowercase &quot;N&quot; before being corrected by the drill sergeant to set his head to the proper position and the &quot;O&quot; soldier has a pillow from his footlocker in his mouth before the sergeant (who had told him this on several prior occasions) tells him to spit it out, which he does. Portions of this segment deal with silent &quot;E&quot; and letters containing two vowels. For example, the &quot;I&quot; soldier is accompanied by two letters, &quot;R&quot; and &quot;P&quot; to form &quot;rip&quot; until the &quot;E&quot; is added at the end of the word to turn the word into &quot;ripe&quot;. The drill sergeant then asks the soldiers regarding the rule prompting the soldiers to sing the tune &quot;When &quot;E&quot; on the end plays a no-talking game, the vowel before it says its name.&quot; The tune would later be the basis for the following examples. Another example is when the &quot;A&quot; soldier is placed between two lowercase consonants &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; to form the word &quot;man&quot;. However the &quot;I&quot; soldier comes into the word to change it into &quot;main&quot;. The drill sergeant then asks the other vowels regarding the rule, prompting them to sing the tune &quot;When two vowels stand side by side, the first one says its name with pride.&quot; The sergeant always ends up getting trampled by the vowels as they leave. On one occasion, he misses them, but they end up shutting the door on him, locking him in, causing him to bang on the door.

The Lone Rearranger Rewrites Again: A spoof of &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, this animated segment features an intelligent, banana nose cowboy named The Lone Rerranger, (or Lone for short), with his horse Hiho, and his sidekick whose name is Russell-Upsome Grub, and a sentence which needs to be rearranged. For example, &quot;Horses must ride cowboys into the corral&quot; needs to be rearranged to say &quot;Cowboys must ride horses into the corral&quot;. After Lone fixes the sentence with his whip, he, Hiho, and Russell leave and the people who did what the original sign said for them to do never get a chance to thank him or Russell, or something loosely related to the subject. Afterwards, the segment would end with Lone on top of Hiho yelling, &quot;Hi-yo, Hiho! Away!&quot;, and then the camera would pan to Russell, who was seen covering his ears and then saying, &quot;Why you must you always yell in that poor horsey&#x27;s ears?&quot;

Moby Duck: A spoof of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, this takes place in a peapod (spoof of Pequod) where there are two captains. The first is Captain Starbuck, the second Captain Ahab. Starbuck looks through a telescope and sees a white animal and yells, &quot;Wait, Cap&#x27;n! Thar she quacks! Moby, the great white duck!&quot; Captain Ahab takes a closer look and gives the tagline &quot;Nay, Mr. Starbuck! That not be Moby, the great white duck! Argh!&quot;, and explains the differences and sounds out syllables, showing, for example, Daisy, the entertaining white snail. The two admit defeat before continuing their search. A running gag is the fact that they never look behind them, which is exactly where Moby is. Another running gag would feature an onscreen assistant throwing water into the face of Ahab, humiliating him. The author is said to be &quot;Melvin Hermille&quot;, a spoof of &quot;Moby Dick&quot; author Herman Melville.

Blending Bowl: A kind of &quot;bowl game&quot; in which NFL players blend sounds to make words. It stars former NFL superstar quarterback turned FOX Sports co-host Terry Bradshaw as a commentator. It is similar to Gawain&#x27;s Word and Blend Mart but with a football setting.

Opposite Bunny: A superhero bunny who saves the day by turning bad things happening in the neighborhood back into good things. The segment ends with the neighbors reviewing the opposites. For example, one episode has the neighbors saying, &quot;First it was raw; now it is cooked. How does that bunny do it?!&quot;

Arty Smartypants
A farcical and somewhat discombobulated bunraku puppet man with large overalls (which he refers to as his &quot;smarty pants&quot;). He is the start of a few different segments:
* &quot;Magic Time With The Great Smartini&quot;: Arty puts two, three or four words in his pants and says a magic word like ebracadebra, or oobracadoobra, then dances to his song - &quot;Ooh ahh, dance in smarty pants ooh agh&quot; - until he has made a compound word and demonstrating it by showing/interacting with the meaning of the word. His assistant and mother is Marmy Smartypants. Due to the popularity of his dance, a short music video was made that featured Arty and various characters from the show (or from other PBS shows) wearing their own &quot;smarty pants&quot; and dancing to the song.
* In some segments, he reads &quot;four words without any assistance whatsoever&quot;. Four words appear in each corner of the screen and he points to them first with his hands, then with his feet. After realizing he is floating in the air, he comically comes crashing down.
* &quot;Not As Smart As A Puck&quot;: In this segment, Arty hosts a game show where the contestant wins if they can prove they are not as smart as a hockey puck.
In later seasons, the segments were replaced with new ones:
* &quot;Short Stories&quot;: Arty reads a small board book.
* &quot;Play with Words&quot;: Arty changes words into completely different ones.

Swami Marmy: This segment features Smarmy Marmy as a fortune teller who tells monkeys their future. In one segment, she tells a monkey that his sister will drop in for a visit, after which she literally, drops in from above. In another segment, she simply tells a monkey &quot;Oops!&quot; after which Marmy knocks her crystal ball off the table and it rolls off and breaks.

Fred Says: Fred Newman portraying himself appears onscreen sounding out a word syllable by syllable after which he acts it or demonstrates it in his usual humor by attaching sounds to each syllable. On multiple occasions, Fred would appear doing his segment twice in the first season.

What&#x27;s Cooking?: A cooking segment starring Theo and Cleo Lion as chefs. In each segment, they have a recipe and all the things they need (and a few they do not need) in front of them with their names on them (For example, slammed and rammed ham with no yam or clam). They read the recipe step-by-step that usually involves getting rid of the extra ingredients and doing something (rather literally) to the main item before placing it in something. When they reach the last step, that involves cooking the food for a certain amount of time, they just say &quot;Nah&quot; and eat it raw. Sometimes, the camera zooms in on the refrigerator and segues into a Sam Spud segment.

The Joy Learno Show: Female Parody of Jay Leno talks to various guests about words and their meanings.

Replacing Letter Songs: Each song for the vowels such as &quot;a&quot; and &quot;e&quot;, etc. This is sung in different words such as &quot;Ben&quot; and &quot;hen&quot;. At the end, a letter is replaced such as &quot;t&quot; and changes a letter to &quot;ten&quot;. Heath the Thesarus would sometimes introduce the segment by saying, &quot;And now, a little poem in which letters change. And make something very interesting happen.&quot;

Marmy&#x27;s Poetry Corner: This segment features Marmy with guest stars.

==Format==
&quot;Between the Lions&quot; focuses on teaching reading and a love of books to young children in a fun, informative way.

Among the educational techniques used by &quot;Between the Lions&quot; are the following:
* Featured Letters and Sounds – Every episode has a feature letter or sound, such as &#x27;h&#x27; or &#x27;the long ee sound&#x27;. Throughout the show, the featured letter or sound is heard and seen in a variety of words. In seasons 7 and 8, an ad shows what&#x27;s coming up next followed by a hand grabbing a letter from the word, usually from the first book.
* Text on Screen – Frequently, keywords or entire sentences of dialog are shown on screen as the characters talk, with the featured letter or combination highlighted. The gray glove then grabs or puts it back in its place after its segment.
* Stories – Every episode contains one or more short stories in the form of books read by the Lion family. These stories tie in thematically with the rest of the episode and also serve as another way to present words with the featured sound in context. Sometimes the stories are real books (like &quot;Sylvester and the Magic Pebble&quot; by William Steig, &quot;Joseph Had a Little Overcoat&quot; by Simms Taback, and &quot;The Carrot Seed&quot; by Ruth Krauss) or well-known tales (like &quot;Rumplestiltskin&quot;, &quot;The Little Red Hen&quot;, and &quot;The Gingerbread Man&quot;); other times they are books that are made-up to fit the episode (like &quot;How Pecos Bill Cleans Up the West&quot; and Lionel&#x27;s favorite book, &quot;Nothing but Lug Nuts&quot;).
* Songs – Silly but informative songs sum up the rules of English spelling and pronunciation in easy-to-remember ways, with lyrics like &quot;When two vowels go walking, the first one does the talking&quot; or &quot;Even the blues would be blue without an s&quot; and many others. Often the text of the song is shown on screen. The songs for the show are by Thomas Z. Shepard, Christopher Cerf, Sarah Durkee and Paul Jacobs.
* Animations and skits – A variety of animations and skits show how words are formed and how one word can be changed into another by adding or removing letters.
* Definitions – Whenever a long or unusual word is used in a dialog or story, a quick definition is given. Usually, it is subtly worked into the conversation, such as when one of the parents responds to a question from the children. Other times it may be provided in a humorous way, such as when Heath Thesaurus pokes his head in to define a word. Occasionally, words may be defined by showing pictures or other artistic methods.
* Repeated Vocabulary – Various vocabulary words are introduced in each episode, ranging from simple, everyday concepts like &quot;jump&quot; and &quot;read&quot; to more complex words like &quot;sequel&quot;, &quot;dictionary&quot;, or &quot;drought&quot;. After a word has been introduced, it is usually used a number of times throughout the episode.

In addition to teaching basic reading, pronunciation, and grammar skills, &quot;Between the Lions&quot; also strives to promote a general love of reading in its viewers. It explores the many subjects that books can cover and shows how different people may enjoy reading different things. It also demonstrates the value of reference books and the importance of reading in other everyday activities like using a computer, cooking with a recipe, or finding your way with street signs.

Some &quot;Between the Lions&quot; episodes also deal with larger episodes related to literary matters: How to handle the scary parts of a story, for example, or the fact that it&#x27;s okay to be a little sad or scared if something bad happens to a character that you like in a book. It also shows how children can use books as jumping points for their own imagination.

Above all, every character on the show expresses a contagious enthusiasm for reading, with the underlying message being &quot;Reading is cool&quot;.

The show&#x27;s curriculum director, Linda Rath, not only had been a working elementary-schoolteacher for many years specializing in reading but also has a PhD from the Harvard Graduate School of Education (where she obtained a master&#x27;s before becoming a schoolteacher), working with reading specialist professor Jeanne Chall. The program&#x27;s educational effectiveness have been researched in several studies.

* Lord Howick declares &quot;If I thought the great mass of people were hostile to Britain, I should say that what ought to be done would be to see how a final separation between them and us could be effectuated without sacrificing British interests; but I do not think that British Canadians are opposed to British domination, for our alliance is more necessary to them than their connection is important to us.&quot;
*Of the French Canadians, he says, &quot;If it be only for their laws and particular usages that they are struggling, surrounded, as they are, by people of other races, they must be aware that they would be made to undergo, if they lost British protection, a much more violent change than any which they have yet had to endure; and certainly, greater and more general than any which we may mean to prescribe for them.&quot; He adds that &quot;Unlimited executive responsibility is irreconcilable with the relations which ought to exist between a colony and the metropolitan power. Mr. Grote says, &quot;If the violation, in part, of the Constitution determined the Canadians to arm in defence of their rights, how will they endure the suspension of the Constitution entirely and the confiscation of popular freedom?&quot;

<text>The GameCube is Nintendo&#x27;s fourth home video game console, released during the sixth generation of video games. It is the successor to the Nintendo 64, and was first launched in Japan on September 14, 2001, followed by a launch in North America on November 18, 2001, and a launch in the PAL regions in May 2002. The successor to the GameCube is the Wii, which was first released in North America on November 19, 2006, and is backward compatible with GameCube games, memory cards, and controllers. Later models RVL-101 and RVL-201 would not feature backwards compatibility. The last game officially released for the system was the North American exclusive Madden NFL 08 in August 2007. There are games on this list. It is organized alphabetically by the games&#x27; localized English titles, or by &quot;rōmaji&quot; transliterations when exclusive to Japan. For a list of games that were announced or in development for the GameCube but never released, see the list of cancelled GameCube games.

<text>The University Library at [[California State University, Northridge]] (CSUN) is located in Northridge, in the northern San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles, California.

==History==
Construction for the original library began on November 14, 1957, marking it as the college&#x27;s first permanent campus building. Students were permitted to use the building beginning on February 16, 1959, and the library had its official opening on March 3. The library featured four floors, 200,000 books and a capacity of approximately 15,000 people. The library was heavily damaged during the 1971 San Fernando Earthquake, making it necessary for the closure of the upper floors of the library for repair and organization.

Original construction of the University Library was in two phases. The first phase was opened on October 24, 1973. The second, completed in 1991, nearly doubled the size with additional east and west wings. Both phases were designed by the architect Leo A. Daly. The 1994 Northridge Earthquake badly damaged the building forcing the library to close. The original &#x27;phase one building&#x27; re-opened later in 1994. The &#x27;second phase wings&#x27; needed demolishing and reconstruction, and re-opened in 2000.

The Library maintains its own AS/RS (Automated Storage and Retrieval System), built in 1991, with a capacity of 1.7 million volumes.

==Naming controversy==
The library was originally named for Delmar T. Oviatt, former vice president for Academic Affairs, who was involved in the founding of San Fernando Valley State College, CSUN&#x27;s predecessor.

In 2019, CSUN president Dianne F. Harrison appointed a campus committee to investigate whether the Oviatt Library should be renamed due to allegations of racism. In fall 2020, the Oviatt Library Advisory Working Group presented its findings to President Harrison, the Associated Students Senate, and the CSUN Faculty Senate, recommending that the name of Delmar T. Oviatt be removed from the University Library. After approval from CSU Chancellor Timothy White, the name was changed to &quot;University Library&quot; in December 2020.

==Services and collections==

The University Library has a collection containing over 850,000 print volumes and nearly 1.3 million ebooks. The Library also subscribes to over 200,000 journals and newspapers. A special focus is the San Fernando Valley History Collection digital archives. The Special Collections &amp; Archives section of the University Library has many archival collections of important primary source documents including a large collection of materials on LGBTQ and Human sexuality, along with the Vahdah Olcott-Bickford collection (part of IGRA: the International Guitar Research Archive), the Old China Hands Archive, and the Tom and Ethel Bradley Center vast collection of photographs from diverse communities of color throughout the United States and Latin America. In addition, the Library&#x27;s Teacher Curriculum Center provides a large circulating collection of curricular materials for education students and local educators.

== Film and television shooting location ==

The University Library has served as a shooting location for numerous films and television series, including &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Sky High&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, &quot;The Middle&quot;, and &quot;The Orville&quot;. It was also one of the filming locations for the music video Intentions by Justin Bieber.

<doc id="485800" wikidata="Q547824" url="?curid=485800" title="HMS Sheffield (D80)">
<text>HMS &quot;Sheffield&quot; was a Type 42 guided missile destroyer and the second Royal Navy ship to be named after the city of Sheffield in Yorkshire. Commissioned on 16 February 1975 the &quot;Sheffield&quot; was part of the Task Force 317 sent to the Falkland Islands during the Falklands War. She was struck and heavily damaged by an Exocet air-launched anti-ship missile from an Argentine Super Étendard aircraft on 4 May 1982 and foundered while under tow on 10 May 1982.

== Design==

The first of the Type 42 class, &quot;Sheffield&quot;, was initially fitted with the odd-looking &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; ears on her funnel tops which were in fact exhaust deflectors – &quot;Loxton bends&quot; – for the Rolls-Royce Olympus TM3B gas turbines, to guide the high-temperature exhaust efflux sidewards and minimise damage to overhead aerials. As this provided a prominent target for then-new infrared homing missiles, only &quot;Sheffield&quot; and the next two in the class, the Argentinian &quot;Hércules&quot; and &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot;, had these &#x27;ears&#x27;. &quot;Sheffield&quot; was the only one of her class to not be fitted with STWS II triple anti-submarine torpedo tubes.

== Construction ==

Ordered in 1968 &quot;Sheffield&quot; was laid down on 15 January 1970 and built by Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering at Barrow-in-Furness. An explosion during construction killed two dockyard workers and damaged a section of hull which was replaced with a section from an identical ship, , being built for the Argentine Navy. &quot;Sheffield&quot; was launched on 10 June 1971 by Queen Elizabeth II and was estimated to have cost £23,200,000 to build.

As the first of her class of Royal Navy destroyers, &quot;Sheffield&quot; spent her first years trying out the new systems and the Sea Dart missile system, particularly as the intended Sea Dart trials ship, , suffered serious fires and problems with its steam systems restricting its use in the late 1970s. It was not until 1980 that &quot;Sheffield&quot; became effective, with Sea Dart and partial installation of electronic warfare Abbey Hill systems. Following a refit in the early 1980s, significant design issues with the ship&#x27;s Type 909 radar (which was responsible for control and targeting of the Sea Dart missiles) were identified. The ship lacked an electronic countermeasures (ECM) jammer.

== Service history ==

In June 1981 she participated in Exercise Roebuck, following which she fired five Sea Dart missiles. Following participation in Exercise Ocean Safari she sailed in November 1981 to undertake patrols in the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf.

She was undergoing maintenance at Mombasa when Captain James Salt took over command on 26 January 1982. Both Salt (whose most recent service had been in submarines) and his second in command (who had been an anti-submarine helicopter observer) had little or no relevant experience in surface ships and little experience in air defence.

In March 1982 the ship transited north through the Suez Canal to participate in Exercise Spring Train, which was held in the Atlantic Ocean.

===Departs for the Falklands===

In response to the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands, &quot;Sheffield&quot; was ordered on 2 April 1982 to join the task force being assembled to retake the islands. Ammunition and supplies were loaded, loose fittings stowed, and unnecessary memorabilia disembarked. All carpets were removed except for those on Deck 1 and above (which subsequently caught fire when she was hit). To avoid her being mistaken for the Argentine &quot;Hércules&quot; and &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot;, a vertical black marking was painted on the funnel and down to the side to her waterline to aid recognition.

Departing for the South Atlantic on 2 April, &quot;Sheffield&quot; reached Ascension Island on 14 April, accompanied by , , , to be later joined by . They joined other vessels of the Task Force 317 and commenced operations in the Total Exclusion Zone around the Falklands on 1 May 1982.

It was British policy that any Royal Navy vessel that suspected itself to be under missile attack turn toward the threat, accelerate to maximum speed and fire chaff to prevent the ship being caught defenceless. The codeword used to start this procedure was &#x27;handbrake&#x27;, which had to be broadcast once the signal of the Super E Agave radar of Super Étendard aircraft was picked up. Within the task force, the threat from the Type 209 submarine was seen as a higher priority than the threat from the air. Following the sinking of , Captain Salt had ordered the ship to change course every 90 seconds to counter any potential Argentine submarine threat.

=== Sinking===

====Argentinian attack====
&quot;Sheffield&quot; was first detected by an Argentine Naval Aviation Lockheed SP-2H Neptune (2-P-112) patrol aircraft at 07:50 on 4 May 1982. The Neptune kept the British ships under surveillance, verifying &quot;Sheffield&quot;″s position again at 08:14 and 08:43. Two Argentine Navy Super Étendards, both armed with AM39 Exocets, took off from Río Grande naval air base at 09:45 and met with an Argentine Air Force KC-130H Hercules tanker to refuel at 10:00. The two aircraft were 3-A-202, piloted by mission commander &quot;Capitán de Fragata&quot; (Lieutenant Commander) Augusto Bedacarratz, and 3-A-203, piloted by &quot;Teniente&quot; (Lieutenant) Armando Mayora.

In the two weeks leading up to the attack, Argentinian pilots had been practising tactics against their own ships, including Type 42 destroyers of the same class as &quot;Sheffield&quot;, and therefore knew the radar horizon, detection distances, and reaction times of the ship radar, as well as the optimal procedure to programme the Exocet missile for a successful attack profile. The technique they used is known colloquially as &quot;Pecking the Lobes&quot;, in reference to the aircraft probing the side lobes of the emitting radar using the radar warning receiver. The aircraft could avoid detection by avoiding the main lobe of the emitting radar.

At 10:35, the Neptune climbed to and detected one large and two medium-sized contacts. A few minutes later, the Neptune updated the Super Étendards with the positions. Flying at very low altitude, at approximately 10:50 both Super Étendards climbed to to verify these contacts, but failed to locate them and returned to low altitude. They later climbed again and after a few seconds of scanning, the targets appeared on their radar screens.

Both pilots loaded the coordinates into their weapons systems, returned to low level, and after last minute checks, each launched an AM39 Exocet missile at 11:04 while away from their targets. The Super Étendards did not need to refuel again from the KC-130, which had been waiting, and landed at Río Grande at 12:04.

Supporting the mission were an Argentine Air Force Learjet 35 as a decoy and two IAI Daggers as the KC-130 escorts.

====On &quot;Sheffield&quot;====

At approximately 10:00 on 4 May, &quot;Sheffield&quot; was at defence watches (second degree readiness), the southernmost of three Type 42 destroyers (the others being HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot; and HMS &quot;Coventry&quot; operating as a forward anti-aircraft picket to the west of the main task force which were south-east of the Falklands. The weather was fair and the sea calm with a 2-metre swell. , which was with the main task force, was responsible for Anti-Air Warfare Coordination (AAWC). &quot;Sheffield&quot; had relieved her sister ship &quot;Coventry&quot; as the latter was having technical trouble with her Type 965 radar.

Prior to the attack, &quot;Sheffield&quot;″s radar operators had been experiencing difficulty distinguishing Mirage and Super Étendard aircraft, and the destroyer may have lacked effective IFF or radar jamming. Despite intelligence briefings that identified an Exocet attack by Super Étendards as possible, &quot;Sheffield&quot; had assessed the Exocet threat as overrated for the previous two days, and disregarded another as a false alarm.

As the Type 965 could not detect low-flying aircraft, the two incoming enemy aircraft were not detected flying at . The two planes were detected at a distance of only by the UAA1, a radar warning receiver. This was then confirmed by the 965M long range aircraft warning radar of &quot;Glasgow&quot; when the aircraft popped up to above sea-level for a radar check at . The &quot;Glasgow&quot; immediately went to action stations, and communicated the warning codeword &#x27;Handbrake&#x27; by UHF and HF to all task force ships. The radar contacts were also seen by &quot;Invincible&quot;, which directed Sea Harriers on combat patrol to investigate, but they detected nothing. The AAWC on &quot;Invincible&quot; declared the radar contacts as false and left the Air Warning at yellow, instead of raising it to red.

In response to &quot;Glasgow&quot;″s warning, an order to stand to was issued to the crews of the 4.5 inch gun, Sea Dart and 20 mm guns. The aircraft were detected on the forward Type 909 radar but not on the aft set. &quot;Sheffield&quot;″s UAA1 sensor was then blocked by an unauthorised transmission by the ship&#x27;s satellite communications systems (SCOT). No information was received via data link from &quot;Glasgow&quot;. Seven seconds later, the first Exocet missile was fired, in response to which &quot;Glasgow&quot; fired its chaff. Onboard &quot;Sheffield&quot;, it was not until smoke from the missile was sighted by lookouts that the crew realised they were under attack. The bridge officers did not call the captain to the bridge, made no call to action stations, made no evasive measures, and made no effort to prepare the 4.5-inch gun, the Sea Dart missiles, or order chaff to be fired. The antiair warfare officer was called to the operations room by the principal warfare officer, arriving just before the first missile hit.

Two Exocets had been launched, the second missile being sighted by &quot;Yarmouth&quot; and missing &quot;Sheffield&quot;, splashing into the sea off her port beam. The Exocet that struck &quot;Sheffield&quot; hit her on the starboard side at deck level 2, travelling through the junior ratings&#x27; scullery and breaching the Forward Auxiliary Machinery Room/Forward Engine Room bulkhead above the waterline, creating a hole in the hull roughly by . Contemporary accounts suggested that the missile failed to explode, despite disabling the ship&#x27;s electrical distribution systems and breaching the pressurised sea water fire main. The damage to the fire system severely hampered any firefighting response and eventually doomed the ship to be consumed by the fire.

At the time of the hit, the captain was off duty in his cabin after having previously visited the operations room, while &quot;Sheffield&quot;″s anti-air warfare officer (AAWO) was in the wardroom chatting to the stewards, and his assistant was in the heads. &quot;Sheffield&quot; and &quot;Coventry&quot; were chatting over UHF and communications ceased until an unidentified message was heard flatly stating, &quot;&quot;Sheffield&quot; is hit.&quot;

====Response====
The flagship, , dispatched the escorts HMS &quot;Arrow&quot; and to investigate, and a helicopter was launched. Confusion reigned until &quot;Sheffield&quot;″s Lynx helicopter unexpectedly landed aboard &quot;Hermes&quot; carrying the air operations officer and operations officer, confirming the strike.

With the principal fire fighting systems out of action due to the loss of the fire main, the crew were reduced to fighting the fire using portable electrically powered pumps and buckets. The control of firefighting lacked cohesion and was uncoordinated with no emergency HQ being established, while crew members were unclear as to where Command was located. &quot;Arrow&quot; and &quot;Yarmouth&quot; assisted in fighting the fire from the outside (to little effect) by stationing themselves to port and starboard respectively.

The crew of &quot;Sheffield&quot; fought for almost four hours to save the ship before Captain Salt made the decision to abandon ship due to the risk of fires igniting the Sea Dart magazine, the loss of the combat capability of the destroyer, and the exposed position to air attack of &quot;Arrow&quot; and &quot;Yarmouth&quot;. Most of the &quot;Sheffield&quot;″&quot;s&quot; crew climbed over onto &quot;Arrow&quot;, a few transferred by Gemini RHIB to &quot;Yarmouth&quot;, while some were taken by helicopter to &quot;Hermes&quot;. As &quot;Sheffield&quot;″&quot;s&quot; crew departed in &quot;Arrow&quot;, Sub-lieutenant Carrington-Wood led the crew in singing &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot; from &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;.

Over the next six days from 4 May 1982, as the ship drifted, five inspections were made to see if any equipment was worth salvaging. Orders were issued to shore up the hole in &quot;Sheffield&quot;″s starboard side and tow the ship to South Georgia. Before these orders were issued, the burnt-out hulk had already been taken under tow by &quot;Yarmouth&quot;. The high seas that the ship was towed through caused slow flooding through the hole in the ship&#x27;s side, causing a list to starboard and which eventually caused &quot;Sheffield&quot; to roll over and sink on the edge of the Total Exclusion Zone in of water at on 10 May 1982, the first Royal Navy vessel sunk in action since World War II.

====Loss of life====
Of the 281 crew members, 20 (mainly on duty in the galley area and computer room) died in the attack with another 26–63 injured, mostly from burns, smoke inhalation or shock. Only one body was recovered. The survivors were taken to Ascension Island on the tanker &quot;British Esk&quot;. The wreck is a war grave and designated as a &quot;protected place&quot; under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986.

==Board of inquiry==
In response to the loss of the ship, a Ministry of Defence (MOD) Board of Inquiry was convened in on 7 June 1982. They reported their findings on 28 June 1982. The board&#x27;s report severely criticized the ship&#x27;s fire-fighting equipment, training and procedures identifying that the critical factors leading to loss of &quot;Sheffield&quot; were:
#Failure to respond to HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot;″s detection and communication of two approaching Super Etendards by immediately going to action stations, activating the Sea Dart and launching chaff decoys;
#Lack of ECM jamming capability;
#Lack of a point defence system;
#Inadequate operator training, in particular simulated realistic low-level target acquisition.
#Slow response of the available Type 909 Sea Dart tracking radar and its operator limited the possible response.
#The spread of the fire was not adequately controlled due to the presence of ignitable material coverings, lack of adequate curtains and sealing to restrict smoke and fires. There was also a shortage of breathing apparatus while the forward escape manholes were found to be too small for men who actually were wearing breathing apparatus.

Captain Salt&#x27;s handling of the ship following the impact of the missile, and his later decision to abandon the ship, were not faulted. The board, however, found that the principal warfare officer and the anti-air warfare officer (AAWO) were guilty of negligence. Admiral John Fieldhouse, the commander in chief of the navy, decided not to court-martial them, undertake any other disciplinary action or any form of formal administrative proceedings.

It was not until 2006, following an extensive campaign by ex-RN personnel, that a heavily censored summary of the board&#x27;s findings that concealed all of the board&#x27;s key conclusions and criticisms, including the findings of negligence was released by the Ministry of Defence under UK Freedom of Information laws.

In 2015, a MOD re-assessment of the attack concluded that the Exocet warhead did indeed detonate inside &quot;Sheffield&quot;, with the results supported by analysis using modern damage analysis tools not available in 1982 and evidence from weapon hits and trials conducted since the end of the Falklands campaign.

In 2017, a complete copy of the report was issued, revealing information that according to &quot;The Guardian&quot; had been &quot;suppressed&quot; from the summary of the board&#x27;s findings in the 2006 release. &quot;The Guardian&quot; explained the missing information as being due to the British Government&#x27;s attempts to sell off the remaining Type 42 destroyers at the same time. In the &quot;uncensored&quot; report, multiple issues that left the ship unprepared for the attack were identified, including findings of negligence against two officers, who according to &quot;The Guardian&quot; &quot;escaped court martial and did not face disciplinary action, apparently in order to avoid undermining the euphoria that gripped much of the UK at the end of the war&quot;. Among other findings, the &quot;uncensored&quot; report showed that the ship was not sufficiently prepared to ward off an attack, during the attack the anti-air warfare officer was not in the operations room, while his assistant had gone to the toilet. The anti-air warfare officer did not believe &quot;Sheffield&quot; was within the range of attack of the Argentinian Air Force.

===Fire===
The sinking of &quot;Sheffield&quot; is sometimes blamed on a superstructure made wholly or partially from magnesium-aluminium alloy, the melting point and ignition temperature of which are significantly lower than those of steel. However, this is incorrect as &quot;Sheffield&quot;″s superstructure was made entirely of mild steel. The confusion is related to the US and British navies abandoning aluminium alloys after several fires in the 1970s involving and and other ships that had aluminium alloy superstructures. The sinking of the Type 21 frigates and , both of which had aluminium alloy superstructures, probably also had an effect on this belief, though these cases are again incorrect and the presence of aluminium alloy had nothing to do with their loss.

The fires in &quot;Sheffield&quot; and other ships damaged by fire caused a later shift by the Royal Navy from the nylon and synthetic fabrics then worn by British sailors. The synthetics had a tendency to melt onto the skin, causing more severe burns than if the crew had been wearing non-synthetic clothing.

<doc id="485801" wikidata="Q3377848" url="?curid=485801" title="HMS Birmingham (D86)">
<text>HMS &quot;Birmingham&quot; was a Type 42 destroyer laid down by Cammell Laird and Company, Limited, at Birkenhead on 28 March 1972, launched on 30 July 1973 by Lady Empson, wife of Sir Derek Empson and commissioned on 3 December 1976. She was named for the city of Birmingham, England.

&quot;Birmingham&quot; was also one of the first ships together with &quot;Ardent&quot; that served in the Persian Gulf on the Armilla patrol that protected oil supplies during the Iran–Iraq War in 1980. She was also the first ship to replenish a Sea Dart missile at sea.
&quot;Birmingham&quot; spent much of her service as Fleet Contingency Ship and spent considerable time in the post-Falklands conflict patrol role. In 1984 she patrolled the Falklands and acted as a radar picket ship along with the frigates and . In 1985 she took part in Standing Naval Force Mediterranean, calling at Gibraltar, Palma de Mallorca, Naples, &amp; Messina. After a refit at Rosyth dockyard, she returned to Portsmouth in 1988 for sea trials and re-acceptance to the fleet. Commanded by Roy Clare, Director of the Maritime Museum in London (2006–7), her first deployment post-refit was a tour to the Persian Gulf region, returning in March 1989.

In July 1990, whilst on deployment as part of the West Indies Guard Ship, &quot;Birmingham&quot;, supported by RFA &quot;Oakleaf&quot; was ordered to sail from Florida to Trinidad in response to the Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt, in which Islamist fundamentalists had taken hostages. However, as the &quot;Birmingham&quot; arrived the hostages were released.

&quot;Birmingham&quot; paid off at Portsmouth on 10 December 1999. In early January 2000 under her own power, she sailed to Devonport where, for the next two months, she was stripped of usable equipment. In May 2000 she was towed back to Portsmouth where she was sold for scrap, leaving under tow for Spain on 20 October 2000.

<doc id="485803" wikidata="Q1640754" url="?curid=485803" title="HMS Glasgow (D88)">
<text>HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot; was a Type 42 destroyer of the Royal Navy. The last of the Batch 1 Type 42 destroyers, &quot;Glasgow&quot; was commissioned in 1979. The destroyer fought during the Falklands War, and on 12 May 1982 was damaged by a bomb from an Argentine A-4 Skyhawk. &quot;Glasgow&quot; was part of the Royal Navy’s 3rd Destroyer Squadron along with HMS &quot;York&quot; (Captain D3), HMS &quot;Edinburgh&quot; and . The 3rd Destroyer Squadron was based in Rosyth during the 1980s and early 1990s before being moved to Portsmouth when Rosyth Dockyard was privatised and re-purposed. The destroyer was decommissioned in 2005 and was broken up for scrap in 2009.

==Design and construction==

She was built at Swan Hunter Shipyard in Wallsend, Tyneside, and launched on 14 April 1976 by Lady Kirstie Treacher, wife of Admiral Sir John Treacher. With a displacement of 4,820 tonnes, &quot;Glasgow&quot; was the sixth and last Batch 1 Type 42 destroyer in the fleet. Named after the Scottish city of Glasgow, she was the eighth ship to bear the name. On 23 September 1976, while being fitted out, a fire on board killed eight men and injured a further six. The ship was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 25 May 1979.

See below design drawings of HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot; in 1982 and 1992, the latter showing weapons and sensor upgrades following a major refit in Rosyth 1988-89.

==Operational history==
The ship was rammed by the Soviet cruiser &quot;Admiral Isakov&quot; on 27 May 1981, while in the Barents Sea collecting information on new Soviet equipment.

===Falklands War===

&quot;Glasgow&quot; was among the five Type 42 destroyers which were part of the task force sent to retake the Falkland Islands after invasion by Argentina on 2 April 1982. Armed with the Sea Dart long range anti-aircraft missile system, &quot;Glasgow&quot; along with her sister ships, and were among the first ships to arrive in a exclusion zone imposed by the British around the islands.

&quot;Glasgow&quot; was deployed towards the South Atlantic direct from Gibraltar, where 18 Royal Navy frigates and destroyers were taking part in &quot;Exercise Spring Train&quot;. On Friday 2 April 1982, 8 of the frigates and destroyers (, , , , , &quot;Glasgow&quot;, &quot;Plymouth&quot; and &quot;Sheffield&quot;) were ordered by CINCFLEET (Commander-in-Chief Fleet) to &quot;store ship&quot; ready to sail south. The stores, fuel and ammunition required for full operational readiness came from a combination of sources, but mostly from the other ships already in Gibraltar at that time. Using a &#x27;buddy ship&#x27; replenishment approach, the ships with less suitable sensor and weapon suites went alongside the deploying ships to transfer stores and ammunition, either by hand or using helicopter vertical replenishment (VERTREP). There were also a number of crew exchanges between the ships deploying and ships returning to the UK i.e. juniors under 17.5 years or crew with other compassionate and operational situations.

&quot;Glasgow&quot; saw action early in the war when, on 2 May, her Lynx helicopter severely damaged the Argentine naval vessel . On 4 May, &quot;Glasgow&quot; detected an Exocet missile fired at the task force and warned the fleet. However &quot;Sheffield&quot; failed to receive the warning and was hit, later sinking. Down to two Type 42s ( and would not arrive until the end of May), &quot;Glasgow&quot; and &quot;Coventry&quot; were left as the long-range defence of the fleet.

Following the loss of &quot;Sheffield&quot;, a new air defence tactic was devised to try to maximise the task group&#x27;s remaining assets; the two remaining Type 42 destroyers paired up with the two Type 22 frigates. The pairs were then deployed much further ahead of the main force in an effort to draw attacking aircraft away from the carrier groups. The idea was that if Sea Dart was unable to neutralise the threat, the short-range Sea Wolf advanced point-defence missile fitted to the frigates could be used. &quot;Coventry&quot; was paired with &quot;Broadsword&quot; and Glasgow paired with &quot;Brilliant&quot;. This combination of ships created a long-range (30 nmi), short-range guided missile capability along with shore bombardment or naval gunfire support (NGS) using the Type 42&#x27;s 4.5-inch guns (range 12 nmi).

This picketing tactic was effective in drawing Argentine aircraft attacks away from the carrier groups and moderately effective in drawing them away from San Carlos Bay. The pairs would take turns positioning themselves closer to the islands, shelling Argentinean positions and then waiting for the aircraft to come.

On 12 May, &quot;Glasgow&quot; and the Type 22 frigate &quot;Brilliant&quot; were on a &quot;42-22&quot; combo around 15 miles south west of Port Stanley. At 11:00 &quot;Glasgow&quot; was carrying out shore bombardment of Argentinean positions. Then later in the afternoon a wave of four A-4B Skyhawk jets of &quot;Grupo 5&quot; attacked. &quot;Glasgow&quot;″s Sea Dart system and 4.5 inch Mk.8 gun both failed, but &quot;Brilliant&quot;″s Sea Wolf shot down 1st Lt Oscar Bustos (C-246) and Lt Jorge Ibarlucea (C-208), whilst Lt Mario Nivoli (C-206) crashed into the sea evading debris. All three pilots died in the action but were posthumously promoted.

Despite the losses in the first wave, a second wave of &quot;Grupo 5&quot; Skyhawks attacked, but &quot;Brilliant&quot;″s Sea Wolf failed and the jets each released three bombs. One bomb from Skyhawk (C-248) piloted by Lt Fausto Gavazzi damaged &quot;Glasgow&quot;, passing clean through the aft engine room without exploding. It damaged fuel systems and disabled the two Tyne cruising engines. A third wave of aircraft was detected but they did not engage the ships. On his return flight, Lt Gavazzi was shot down by friendly fire over Goose Green and killed. Gavazzi was posthumously promoted to Capitan for his bravery.

Lt Gavazzi&#x27;s bomb had hit &quot;Glasgow&quot; 3 feet above the waterline on the starboard side where damage control teams quickly plugged the hole. The exit hole was much more difficult to access behind machinery and closer to the waterline, so the ship was temporarily patched until it could reach calmer waters. The &quot;Glasgow&quot; was no longer fully operationally effective due to a limited speed of 10 knots and returned to the main group. &quot;Glasgow&quot; eventually returned home to be repaired in Portsmouth Dockyard. &quot;Glasgow&quot; then returned to the South Atlantic after the end of the war (August 1982) on routine Atlantic Patrol South.

===Post-war===

In later years, &quot;Glasgow&quot; served on a variety of missions including acting as the West Indies Guard Ship (WIGS) in 1987. &quot;Glasgow&quot; had a major refit in Rosyth during 1991-92 which included major machinery replacements, weapons and sensor upgrades including replacing her dated 30 mm Oerlikons with 20mm Phalanx. While performing sea trials, issues with the new propulsion system and new radar meant she had to keep returning to port. 1990 saw her calling at New York and Toronto. In 1991, the destroyer deployed to the Persian Gulf on ARMILLA Patrol just after the Gulf War. In 1992, the warship was sent to the Mediterranean for the first time as part of the NATO naval force, STANAVFORMED. &quot;Glasgow&quot; was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping task force from 19 to 29 September 1999. In early 2004, the ship was deployed on the Atlantic Patrol South tasking. Like most Royal Navy Ships, HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot; maintained a proud and productive relationship with her namesake city of Glasgow; visiting Yorkhill Quay on the River Clyde on several occasions during her commission.

==Decommissioning and fate==

It was announced in July 2004, as part of the &quot;Delivering Security in a Changing World&quot; review, that &quot;Glasgow&quot; would be decommissioned in January 2005. &quot;Glasgow&quot; was formally decommissioned on 1 February 2005. On 7 January 2009 she was towed from Portsmouth to Turkey for breaking up.

<text>HMS &quot;Coventry&quot; was a Type 42 (&quot;Sheffield&quot;-class) destroyer of the Royal Navy. Laid down by Cammell Laird and Company, Limited, at Birkenhead on 29 January 1973, she was launched on 21 June 1974 and accepted into service on 20 October 1978 at a cost of £37,900,000.

She was sunk by Argentine Air Force A-4 Skyhawks on 25 May 1982 during the Falklands War.

== Background ==
The principal role of these ships was to provide the fleet with mid-range anti-air warfare capability with secondary roles of anti-surface and anti-submarine. A total of fourteen Type 42s were built for the Royal Navy between 1972 and 1985, in three tranches, with &quot;Coventry&quot; the last of the first tranche to be commissioned. To cut costs, the first two tranches had 47 feet removed from the bow and the beam-to-length ratio reduced. These early Type 42s performed poorly during trials and were notoriously poor sea-keepers.

Type 42 destroyers were fitted with the Sea Dart surface-to-air missiles designed in the 1960s to counter threats from crewed aircraft. Sea Dart was constrained by limitations on its firing capacity and reaction time, but did prove itself during the Falklands War with seven kills, three of these attributed to &quot;Coventry&quot;.

== Service history ==

===1978–1982===
&quot;Coventry&quot; was commissioned on 10 November 1978 under the command of Captain C. P. O. Burne at Portsmouth. Following post-commissioning trials, the ship was used to trial the operation of the new Westland Lynx helicopter from the Type 42 platform, to test the combination&#x27;s safe operating limits.

The ship&#x27;s first major deployment came in 1980 when she was sent to the Far East; in September of that year, alongside and , she became the first British warship to visit the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 30 years. En route back to the UK, &quot;Coventry&quot; was diverted to the Persian Gulf following the outbreak of the Iran–Iraq War, where the ship remained on patrol for six weeks until relieved by the start of the permanent Armilla patrol consisting of and . Throughout 1981 and into 1982, &quot;Coventry&quot; took part in various exercises in home waters, culminating in her deployment as part of Exercise Springtrain &#x27;82 in March 1982. Once Springtrain &#x27;82 was complete, &quot;Coventry&quot; was scheduled to return to the UK prior to a deployment on an intelligence-gathering mission against Soviet naval forces in the Barents Sea, for which the ship had been fitted with special communications monitoring equipment.

=== Falklands campaign ===

&quot;Coventry&quot; was taking part in the Exercise Springtrain 82 near the British base of Gibraltar, during March 1982. Along with other vessels involved in the exercise she was detailed for service in the Falklands War. She had a Union Flag painted on the roof of her bridge and a black line painted through her funnel to her waterline to aid recognition, as the Argentines also operated two Type 42 destroyers. On 27 April, &quot;Coventry&quot;, in company with , , and , entered the Total Exclusion Zone, a 200-mile cordon around the Falkland Islands. Alongside &quot;Sheffield&quot; and &quot;Glasgow&quot;, &quot;Coventry&quot; would form the air defence vanguard for the aircraft carriers following behind.

&quot;Coventry&quot;″s contribution to the Falklands War was considerable. Her helicopter was the first to fire Sea Skua air-to-surface anti-ship missiles in action. Her Westland Lynx HAS.Mk.2 fired two Sea Skua missiles on 3 May at , the former . One missile missed and the other hit a small boat, knocking out the radio aerials and slightly injuring a crewman manning a 20 mm gun. &quot;Glasgow&quot;″s Lynx fired two more Sea Skua, and the vessel retreated, with eight crew killed, eight wounded and heavy damage. Her damaged bridge is now on display at the Naval Museum in Tigre, Argentina. The vessel remained in service in the Argentine Navy until 2018.

&quot;Coventry&quot; was the first warship to fire Sea Dart surface-to-air missiles in anger when the ship fired three on 9 May at two Learjets of Escuadrón Fénix, just missing the aircraft. reported that her radar tracked the missiles merging with the pair of contacts (call signs Litro and Pepe), but they missed the aircraft.

&quot;Coventry&quot;″s captain, David Hart Dyke, claimed that two A-4C Skyhawks of Grupo 4 were shot down by Sea Darts (C-303 and C-313). However, both were actually lost to bad weather, and both wrecks were found on South Jason Island, one on the northwest side of the cliffs, the other in shallow waters on the southwest. Lt Casco and Lt Farias were both killed.

The first confirmed kill made by &quot;Coventry&quot; was an Aérospatiale Puma helicopter of 601 Assault Helicopter Battalion, shot down by a Sea Dart over Choiseul Sound, killing its three-man crew.

&quot;Coventry&quot; had been one of three Type 42 destroyers providing anti-aircraft cover for the fleet. With the loss of &quot;Sheffield&quot; and damage to &quot;Glasgow&quot; on 12 May, forcing her to return to the UK, &quot;Coventry&quot; was left to carry out the role alone, until other ships could arrive from the UK.

===&quot;Type 64&quot;===
Following the loss of &quot;Sheffield&quot;, a new air defence tactic was devised to try to maximise the task group&#x27;s remaining assets. This saw the two remaining Type 42s paired with the two Type 22 frigates (a pairing unofficially termed &quot;Type 64&quot;) and deployed much further ahead of the main force in an effort to draw attacking aircraft away from the carriers. The idea was that in the event of Sea Dart being unable to function, the short range Sea Wolf advanced point defence missile fitted to the frigates could be used. In this, &quot;Coventry&quot; was paired with .

=== 25 May 1982 ===

On 25 May 1982, &quot;Coventry&quot; and &quot;Broadsword&quot; were ordered to take up position to the north-west of Falkland Sound. There she would act as a decoy to draw Argentinian aircraft away from other ships at San Carlos Bay. In this position, close to land, with not enough open sea between her and the coast, her Sea Dart missiles would be less effective. &quot;Broadsword&quot; was armed with the Sea Wolf missile, which is for short range anti-aircraft and anti-missile use.

At first, the trap worked, with FAA A-4B Skyhawk C-244 of &quot;Grupo&quot; 5 shot down north of Pebble Island by a Sea Dart. Pilot &quot;Capitán&quot; Hugo Ángel del Valle Palaver was killed. Later a FAA A-4C Skyhawk coded C-304 of &quot;Grupo&quot; 4 de Caza deployed to San Julian was shot down north east of Pebble Island by another Sea Dart while returning from a mission to San Carlos Water. Capitán Jorge Osvaldo García successfully ejected but was not recovered from the water. His body was washed ashore in a dinghy at Golding Island in 1983. Garcia&#x27;s wingman, Lieutenant Ricardo Lucero, was also shot down by the combined San Carlos air defences. Teniente Lucero ejected, and was recovered by .

The two ships then came under attack by two waves of two Argentine Douglas A-4 Skyhawks. The first wave carried one 1,000 lb free-fall bomb each while the aircraft of the second carried 3 x 250 kg bombs. The four Skyhawks flew so low that &quot;Coventry&quot;″s targeting radar could not distinguish between them and the land and failed to lock on. &quot;Broadsword&quot; attempted to target the first pair of attackers (Captain Pablo Carballo and Lieutenant Carlos Rinke) with her Sea Wolf missile system, but her own tracking system locked down during the attack and could not be reset before the aircraft released their bombs.

Of the bombs released, one bounced off the sea and struck &quot;Broadsword&quot;″s flight deck and, though it failed to explode, wrecked the ship&#x27;s Westland Lynx helicopter. &quot;Coventry&quot; claimed to have hit the second Skyhawk (Captain Pablo Marcos Carballo) in the tail with small arms fire, although the aircraft returned safely to Argentina. Carballo&#x27;s plane was hit under the right wing by a piece of shrapnel, on his way in, which pierced his aircraft&#x27;s right fuel tank.

The second pair of Skyhawks (First Lieutenant Mariano Ángel Velasco and Ensign Jorge Nelson Barrionuevo), headed for &quot;Coventry&quot; 90 seconds later at a 20-degree angle to her port bow. Still unable to gain a missile lock, &quot;Coventry&quot; launched a Sea Dart missile in an attempt to distract them and turned hard to starboard to reduce her profile. On &quot;Broadsword&quot; the Sea Wolf system had been reset and successfully acquired the attacking aircraft, but was unable to fire as &quot;Coventry&quot;″s turn took her directly into the line of fire.

&quot;Coventry&quot; used her 4.5-inch gun and small arms against the attacking aircraft. The port Oerlikon 20 mm cannon jammed, leaving the ship with only rifles and machine guns to defend herself. &quot;Coventry&quot; was struck by three bombs just above the water line on the port side. One of the bombs exploded beneath the computer room, destroying it and the nearby operations room, incapacitating almost all senior officers. The other entered the forward engine room, exploding beneath the junior ratings dining room where the first aid party was stationed, and the ship immediately began listing to port. The latter hit caused critical damage as it breached the bulkhead between the forward and aft engine rooms, exposing the largest open space in the ship to uncontrollable flooding. Given the design of the ship, with multiple watertight compartments, two hits virtually anywhere else might have been just survivable. The third bomb did not explode.

Within 20 minutes &quot;Coventry&quot; had been abandoned and had completely capsized. &quot;Coventry&quot; sank shortly after. Nineteen of her crew were killed and a further 30 injured. One of the wounded, Paul Mills, suffered complications from a skull fracture sustained in the sinking of the ship and later died on 29 March 1983; he is buried in his home town of Swavesey, Cambridgeshire. After the ship was struck, her crew, waiting to be rescued, sang &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot; from &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;.

&quot;Broadsword&quot; subsequently rescued 170 of &quot;Coventry&quot;″s crew.

== Tributes ==

Crew members of &quot;Coventry&quot; were mentioned-in-dispatches and received commendations. CPO Aircrewman M J Tupper of No.846 NAS was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal for his part in the rescue. After the war, a cross to commemorate crew members who lost their lives was erected on Pebble Island.

David Hart Dyke, &quot;Coventry&quot;″s commanding officer during the Falklands War, wrote about the ship&#x27;s tale in his book &quot;Four Weeks in May: The Loss of HMS Coventry&quot;. This was adapted by the BBC into a documentary &quot;Sea of Fire&quot;, with dramatised sequences and shown in June 2007. In 2011 it was announced that a feature-length film would be produced based on &quot;Four Weeks in May&quot;, to be written and directed by Tom Shankland. The documentary television series &quot;Seconds from Disaster&quot; featured the attack on the Coventry in the episode &quot;Sinking the Coventry&quot; in December 2012.

The wreck site is a controlled site under the Protection of Military Remains Act. Five months after &quot;Coventry&quot; sank, a RN Fleet Diving Team conducted an underwater survey of the wreck, which they found lying on her port side in approximately of water. This survey was the beginning of &quot;Operation Blackleg&quot;, a series of dives to recover classified documentation and equipment and to make the remaining weapons safe by means of explosive demolition. The dive team recovered several personal items belonging to Hart Dyke and other officers along with the ship&#x27;s battle ensign, later presented to the next , a Type 22 frigate. The divers also recovered the Cross of Nails, originally presented to the ship by Coventry Cathedral. This too was loaned to the new &quot;Coventry&quot;, until her decommissioning in 2002, when it returned to the cathedral. The Cross is now carried on board , a Type 45 destroyer.

There is a memorial plaque to the dead of HMS &quot;Coventry&quot; at Holy Trinity Church, Coventry.

<text>A film transition is a technique used in the post-production process of film editing and video editing by which scenes or shots are combined. Most commonly this is through a normal cut to the next shot. Most films will also include selective use of other transitions, usually to convey a tone or mood, suggest the passage of time, or separate parts of the story. These other transitions may include dissolves, L cuts, fades (usually to black), match cuts, and wipes.

==Shot transitions==

Every film today, whether it be live-action, computer generated, or traditional hand-drawn animation is made up of hundreds of individual shots that are all placed together during editing to form the single film that is viewed by the audience. The shot transition is the way in which two of these individual shots are joined together.

=== Caesura ===
Principally a literary term denoting a rhythmical pause and break in a line of verse. In poetry, the caesura is used to diversify rhythmical progress and thereby enrich accentual verse.

==== Some applications ====
The term first gained significance in motion-picture art through the editing experiments of Sergei Eisenstein. In applying his concept of montage as the &quot;collision of shots&quot;, Eisenstein often included caesuras – rhythmical breaks – in his films. The acts of The Battleship Potemkin (1925) are separated by caesuras that provide a rhythmical contrast to the preceding action. The intense, frenetic action of the mutiny, for example, is followed by the lyrical journey of a dinghy to the shore. The three Burt Bacharach musical sequences in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) provide contrasting caesuras that separate the major actions of the film. Several intense action sequences in &quot;Master and Commander&quot; (2003), including a raging sea storm and fight scenes, are followed by caesuras – quiet, scenic interludes that are often accompanied by melodic cello music.

=== Continuity ===
The continuity is the development and structuring of film segments and ideas so that the intended meaning is clear, and the transitions employed to connect the film parts. In a more specific meaning, &quot;continuity&quot; refers to the matching of individual scenic elements from shot to shot so that details and actions, filmed at different times, will edit together without error. This process is referred to as &quot;continuity editing&quot;. To maintain continuity within sequences, the editor will often cut on character action so that the scene flows together without noticeable jump-cuts (see below). Lapses in the flow of action can be avoided by transition and cutaway devices (see below). Music and sound are often utilized to provide a sense of continuity to a scene or sequences that may contain a variety of unmatched shots taken in different locations. For example, in Rocky (1976), the song &quot;Getting High&quot; served as a continuity device during the highly fragmentary sequence showing Rocky in the various training preparations for his title fight. The song connected the numerous brief shots so that they appeared as a single and complete unit within the film.

=== Cut ===
The cut is the most basic and common type of transition. In a cut, one image on the screen is instantly replaced by another, often with a change in camera angle. Shot A ends abruptly and shot B begins&quot;.&quot; Cuts can be classified into different types, as detailed below.

==== Cutaway ====

A shot edited into a scene that presents information that is not a part of the first shot. The cutaway shot is usually followed by a return to the original shot, and is often used to condense time in a scene by eliminating undesired action or to cover a loss of continuity in the action. For example, a series of shots of a woman smoking a cigarette may not match correctly in editing because of the varied lengths of cigarette ash from shot to shot. A cutaway to a mantel clock, ticking away the time, would provide enough distraction to cover the loss of continuity. Or the cutaway of the clock could be inserted between a shot of the woman smoking a cigarette and one of the woman reading a book. The cutaway would permit the editor to advance the action in time.

==== Cut-in ====
A shot that presents material in a scene in greater detail, usually through a close-up shot. A cut-in isolates and emphasizes an element of the mise-en-scène for dramatic or informational value. Each progressive movement through the shot sequence, from long shot to close-up, constitutes a form of cut-in. A cut-in made from a long shot to a big close-up can have a startling effect on the viewer because of this immediate magnification. This technique is frequently an editing method of suspense films.

Related, there is the insert shot, which is a shot containing visual detail that is inserted into a scene for informational purposes or to provide dramatic emphasis. A close-up view of printed material in a book, intercut as a character reads, is a type of informational point-of-view insert. The intercutting of a close-up view of a gun resting on a desk within a room where a violent argument is occurring constitutes a type of dramatic insert. Detail shot is another term for insert short.

====Contrast cut==== 
An editor can strategically cut to juxtapose two subjects. For instance, somebody dreaming of a beautiful field of flowers, shot A, may suddenly wake up inside a burning building, shot B. The sound would be serene and peaceful in shot A, and suddenly loud and painful in shot B. This contrast between peace and chaos is intensified through the sudden transition.

==== Dynamic cutting ====
The dynamic cutting is an approach to film editing in which the cutting from one shot to the next is made abruptly apparent to the viewer. In matched cutting or invisible editing, the cuts are not as obvious to the viewer because these approaches adhere to continuity procedures designed to hide the edit -for instance, cutting on action. Dynamic cutting, on the other hand, is self-conscious and will often startle the viewer by moving abruptly in time or space or by rapid cutting within a scene for expressive as well as narrative purposes. Bob Fosse&#x27;s &quot;All That Jazz&quot; (1979), Richard Rush&#x27;s &quot;The Stunt Man&quot; (1980), and Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;JFK&quot; (1991) and &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; (1994) employed dynamic cutting extensively. Dynamic cutting is a featured editing element in the films of Quentin Tarantino, from &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; (1992) to &quot;Django Unchained&quot; (2012).

==== Direct cut ====
Related to the dynamic cutting, the direct cut is an instantaneous change of shots, usually to a new locale or time frame, and executed without an optical transition device. The direct cut serves to replace, dynamically, one shot with another.

====L cut====

An L Cut is an editing technique that results in a cut occurring at a different time for audio than for video. For example, we may hear characters&#x27; voices a few seconds before we see them on film. In order to achieve this effect, the editor had to make an L-shaped cut on the filmstrip itself. Even today with the advent of computerized non-linear editing systems, the digital representation of the film in the program still takes on this L-shaped appearance.

==== Match cut====
The match cut joins together two pieces of film that contain two similarly shaped objects in similar positions in the frame. One of the most famous examples of this is the edit in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; where the bone thrown by a prehistoric ape cuts to a futuristic space station.

====Invisible cut====
Like the match cut, the invisible cut attempts to join two shots with similar frames together. The invisible cut, however, is designed to completely hide the transition from the audience. The audience can deduce a cut has occurred, but it would have a hard time pinpointing the exact moment. For example, if a character walks towards the camera, completely covering it, the cut is introduced when the back of the character is shown walking away. The invisible cut can also be hidden by a whip pan, entering/leaving a very dark or very light environment, or by an object crossing the screen.

====Parallel editing cut====
For example, imagine an action scene where a villain is chasing the hero of the film. To spend the entire chase scene trying to keep both the hero and the villain in the frame at the same time will become very difficult and un-engaging after a while. A better way to approach this problem is through the use of parallel cutting. In this example, the scene would consist of several shots of the hero running in one direction, and some shots of the villain running in the same direction. Perhaps the hero looks back, out of frame, at his pursuer. At this point, the editor would insert a shot of the villain. Neither character occupies the same screen space, yet the audience still understands that one is chasing the other. This technique is parodied in the film &quot;Naked Gun 2½&quot; where the editing swaps between showing the hero and the villain firing at each other, then finally in a long shot we realize they are in fact only about four feet away from each other.

====Jump cut====
A jump cut is usually the result of a continuity error, and not a stylistic choice by the director. But the director can purposely use it to create an effect of passing time without showing the whole event take place. A jump cut occurs when a cut, designed to act merely as a camera angle change (less than 30-degrees), reveals a continuity discrepancy between the two shots. For instance, if a character has their hand over their mouth in a medium shot, and not in their close-up, this little detail, which probably was not noticed on set, is now painfully obvious to the viewers.

=== Defocus transition ===
The defocus transition is a type of transition accomplished by rolling the lens focus until the scene becomes blurred. Passage of time within a scene can be suggested by refocusing the shot after alterations are made in the scene: change of costume, lighting, and other continuity elements. The defocus device has also been frequently employed in transitions to dream or fantasy sequences.

===Fade in/out===
A fade occurs when the picture gradually turns to a single color, usually black, or when a picture gradually appears on screen. Fade ins generally occur at the beginning of a film or act, while fade outs are typically found at the end of a film or act.

====Dissolve====
Like the fade, a dissolve involves gradually changing the visibility of the picture. However, rather than transitioning from a shot to a color, a dissolve is when a shot changes into another shot gradually. Dissolves, like cuts, can be used to create a link between two different objects, a man telling a story, and a visual of his story, for instance.

==== Ripple dissolve ====
A ripple dissolve is a type of transition characterized by a wavering image that is usually employed to indicate a change to flashback material, commonly a character&#x27;s memory of an event. Sometimes the ripple dissolve is used as a transition to an imagined event or action. A series of three ripple dissolves appeared in &quot;Mamma mia&quot;! (2008) as Donna (Meryl Streep) discovers her three former lovers in the attic of her Greek villa. The brief ripple dissolves transport each man visually back in time to reveal their 1960&#x27;s &quot;hippy&quot;, &quot;love children&quot; appearances as Donna remembers them.

=== Washout ===
The washout is an optical transition used for editing purposes that is similar to the fade. Unlike the fade-out, where the images fade to black, in a washout the images suddenly start to bleach out or to color until the screen becomes a frame of white or colored light. A new scene will then follow.

Also, the washout is the most extreme form of overexposure, which is the act of exposing each frame of film to more light or for a longer period of time than would be required to produce a &quot;normal&quot; exposure of the same subject. There is little or no visible detail in the highlights - the bright areas of the picture - and images appear bleached, more or less washed out. The effect is accomplished by directing the camera at a bright light source that would wash out most, if not all, of the frame area, or by having the effect processed in the film laboratory. While in 2014 some motion-picture directors were still opting for film emulsion-based photographic materials rather than digitally retrieved imagery, the number doing so was rapidly decreasing.

==== Some applications ====
Ingmar Bergman made extensive use of the washout in this psychological film &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; (1972). Bergman varied the technique for both the purposes of transition and for continuing his expressive use of color in the picture. The washouts would bring a single, rich color to the end of a scene to symbolize the emotions and psychological passions at work in the story. Washouts were also effectively employed in the fantasy sequences of &quot;Catch-22&quot; (1970). &quot;Monster&quot; (2003) concludes with a washout as Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron) leaves the courtroom after she is sentenced to death. Similarly, a slow washout to white brings &quot;Hours&quot; (2012) to a tearful but happy conclusion in a shot where a father (Paul Walker) cuddles his premature daughter, whose life he has saved in a New Orleans hospital without electricity while Hurricane Katrina rages.

===Wipe===

A wipe involves one shot replacing another, traveling from one side of the frame to another. Think of a vertical line passing from the right side of the frame to the left. On the left side of this line, we have shot A, and on the right side of this line is shot B. When this line reaches the left edge of the frame, shot B will completely fill the scene, and the transition is complete. This example describes a vertical line wipe, though this is but one type of wipe.

Another common type of wipe uses objects in the scene, rather than an invisible vertical line. One interesting application of this creates the illusion of a camera passing through the ceiling of the bottom floor of a multi-story house to the ground of the floor above. In this case, shot A would consist of the camera rising to the ceiling, and shot B would have the camera rising from the ground. A wipe transition gives the impression the camera is passing between the floors of a house.

==== Natural wipe ====
A transition technique accomplished by an element within the mise-en-scène rather than by a laboratory process. A character or an object is brought to the lens of the camera and wipes away the scene by completely blocking or blurring the frame. A closing door often serves as a natural wipe. The natural wipe is followed by a new scene. A head-on, tail-away transition is a type of natural wipe that is used to end one scene and to reveal another.

====Iris wipe====
The wipe shape can also be circular through the use of the camera&#x27;s iris. By closing the iris, a blurry circle sweeps inwards to the middle of the frame, drawing attention to the subject occupying this center space.

===Morph===

Although not always confined to shot transitions, a morph can be thought of as a dissolve combined with a visual effect. Rather than simply blending the colors together, a morph is able to gradually reshape an object to become another object, creating a much stronger connection than a simple dissolve can provide. One famous example of this can be found towards the end of the film &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. The face of young private Ryan (played by actor Matt Damon) is slowly morphed back to an older private Ryan (played by Harrison Young), while at the same time the background is dissolved from a besieged city during World War 2, into a graveyard set in the modern day; there is no doubt in the audience&#x27;s mind about the two men being one and the same.

=== Sound effects ===

==== Overlapping sound ====
An overlapping sound is usually a sound effect or speech that continues briefly from one shot into the next. Overlapping sound may be a sound advance, where a speech or sound effect in an incoming shot is heard briefly in the outgoing shot. Overlapping sound may be used to connect, dynamically, two separate pieces of dramatic action or to enhance the pace of story development.

==== Sound advance / sound bridge ====
It is the advancement of a sound, to be heard in a new shot or scene, taken from the end of the preceding scene. Sound advances, common in modern films, are actually combined with cut transitions to pull the action of the story forward in a dynamic manner.

===== Some applications =====
Alfred Hitchcock fairly well patented the sound advance in his 1929 classic &quot;Blackmail&quot;. A young woman (Anny Ondra) wandering the streets of London in shock after killing a man, comes upon a drunk lying on the pavement, his arm extended in the same manner as the artist just murdered by the woman in his studio apartment. The image of the arm seems to precipitate a scream from the young woman. A cut, however, reveals that the scream is coming from a landlady who has just discovered the dead artist&#x27;s body in his apartment. The sound advance also has conceptual, satirical, and dramatic possibilities. In &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot; (1970), the unexpected sound of a bowling ball rolling down a bowling lane is heard in the final seconds of a scene in a motel room where Jack Nicholson has taken a girlfriend. Just as the ball strikes the tenpin, a cut is made to a new scene where Nicholson is bowling with the woman. The combined sound advance and the cut transition together serve as a sexual metaphor.

==== Asynchronous sound ====
An asynchronous sound is a term for sound that has not been synchronized with the screen image. Asynchronous sound also includes aesthetic use of sound for expressive purposes. Because of the composite nature of film art, the element of sound (music, dialogue, sound effects) is highly manipulative. The sounds of a clucking chicken can be juxtaposed with a shot of a ranting politician for satirical effect.

A popular variation of asynchronous sound in contemporary filmmaking has been in the use of sound advances in the editing scenes. An asynchronous sound advance can occur when the editor shows the face of a character screaming in horror, and instead of using the natural sound of the character&#x27;s horrified voice, inserts the piercing, shrill siren of a police car, to be seen in the following scene. The device of the sound advance combines asynchronous and synchronous sound in a uniquely cinematic way. Francis Ford Coppola made extensive use of combined synchronous-asynchronous sound in the baptism scene of &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972). Near the end of the film, shots of a solemn religious ceremony are juxtaposed with scenes of a vendetta occurring simultaneously in various parts of the city. The sounds of the grand church music and priestly intonations of the baptismal rite continue uninterrupted as the gunmen carry out their tasks. Through the use of synchronous-asynchronous sound, and visual crosscutting, an ironic, psychological linking of past, present, and future occurs. Asynchronous sound can serve to create irony between sound and image, to satirize and parody dramatic situations, and to link separate moments of time in expressive ways.

=== Psychological time ===
Psychological time is a term referring to the use of filming devices that, in the continuity of a motion-picture narrative, suggest not chronological time but time as it is perceived by a character&#x27;s mind. A dissolve (see above) for example, most commonly reveals a passage of time when used within an ongoing scene. The dissolve, by tradition, serves to include intervening time and action. If however, a dissolve rather than a cut is used in a continuing uninterrupted action, its unconventional placement carries psychological implications. Subjectively inspired psychodramas by experimental filmmakers, such as &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot; (1943) by Maya Deren, often exploit the psychological dissolve for a mind&#x27;s-time effect. Psychological time can also be suggested by the repeated use of a piece of action. The condemned traitor&#x27;s final, desperate effort in &quot;An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge&quot; (1962) to reach his wife is conveyed in psychological time by a repeated telephoto shot of the man running down the road to his home. He appears suspended in time and place, which in fact he is; shortly after these shot repetitions the viewer discovers that the traitor&#x27;s entire flight has been a fantasy revealed through an extended use of psychological time. A particularly engaging and sometimes bewildering use of psychological character perception accurs in Memento (2000), a film about a man who is searching for his wife&#x27;s murderer. The search is complicated by the fact that the man has lost his short-term memory. Events come and go on the screen without their meaning being clear at first revelation. Psychological time is a distinguishing element in Shane Carruth&#x27;s 2013 experimental science-fiction film &quot;Upstream Color&quot;. Avoiding a well-made narrative structure, the plot of Upstream Color centers on a man and woman who are targets of parasitic engineering and whose lives dissolve into mental and psychological disarray. Time is rendered in abrupt, discontinuous fragments, with daily reality intermingling with mental apparitions and abstract imagery.

<text>Chester L. Schmitt (May 8, 1912 – February 20, 1993) of New Kensington, Pennsylvania served in the Pennsylvania State Legislature for sixteen years, serving the 54th District. He is noted for working to establish the Pennsylvania Consumer Credit Act, which served as the model for the Federal Truth In Lending Law.

Schmitt was known to his constituents as &quot;Mr. Consumer&quot;. A bridge built in 1927 to connect New Kensington to East Deer Township across the Allegheny River, was named in his honor in 1989.

==Formative years and family==
Schmitt was married to Sally Lou Schmitt, a licensed insurance and real estate sales agent who was the co-manager of their business. They had four children and eight grandchildren.

==Career==
Before and after his time in office, Schmitt owned a successful insurance and real estate company in New Kensington, which he opened in 1945.

He was president of the International Brotherhood of Magicians during the 1961-1962 membership year. Per that organization&#x27;s house organ, &quot;The Linking Ring&quot; (Vol. 41, No. 5), his jobs previous to his time in office (and his later business interests) included being a newsboy, bowling alley pin-boy (and later, the alley&#x27;s manager), movie projectionist and grocery chain store manager.

<text>HMS &quot;Exeter&quot; was a Type 42 destroyer, the fifth ship of the Royal Navy to be named &quot;Exeter&quot;, after the city of Exeter in Devon. The vessel fought in the Falklands War and the first Gulf War, she was scrapped in 2011.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Exeter&quot; was the first of the slightly modified &#x27;Batch 2&#x27; Type 42 destroyers which had weapons and sensor upgrades with no discernible hull modifications. The weapons and sensors fit was the first grouping of the 1022, 992Q and 1006 radars in a British warship.

The ship was built by Swan Hunter, and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 19 September 1980. In 1981 , fired the last Mk 1 Sea Slug missiles to allow &quot;Exeter&quot;″s new radars to fully integrate and align the superior Sea Dart missile against, high and low missile targets.

Early in her first commission, &quot;Exeter&quot; had a turquoise hull on and below the waterline; this was an experimental co-polymer paint which was only available in a few non-standard colours at the time. The light-blue &#x27;boot topping&#x27; visible on the waterline was eventually repainted to standard brick red/black during her first docking period, after the Falklands War.

==Operational history==
===1981-1990===
The ship saw service in the Falklands War, deploying from the Caribbean after the loss of . During the conflict, &quot;Exeter&quot; shot down three Argentine aircraft (two A-4C Skyhawks on 30 May, and a Learjet 35A on 7 June; all with Sea Dart missiles). She may also have shot down an Exocet missile on 30 May. Between 1982 and 1984 she was commanded by Captain Hugh Balfour.

===1991-2000===
&quot;Exeter&quot; also served in Operation Granby during the 1991 Gulf War, under the command of Captain Nigel Essenhigh. Among her roles was the air defence of the US battleships bombarding enemy positions.

In autumn 1998, she emerged from a major refit in Rosyth dockyard. After post refit trials she undertook Operational Sea Training in the spring of 1999 and a Joint Maritime Course with Sea Dart high seas firings in June of that year. September 1999 saw her deploy on Armilla patrol. She was alongside in Dubai for the Millennium and remained on station until relieved by a large Task Group led by the aircraft carrier in February 2000, arriving back at Portsmouth the following month.

===2001-2008===
As the last remaining Royal Navy ship in commission to have served in the Falklands, &quot;Exeter&quot; attended the 25th-anniversary commemorations of the Falklands War in Newquay, Cornwall in 2007.

In May 2008, &quot;Exeter&quot; visited London to provide the centerpiece for the launch of a new James Bond novel; the day before &quot;Devil May Care&quot; was launched, the press party to publicise the launch of the book included Tuuli Shipster bringing copies up the River Thames on a speedboat for a party on &quot;Exeter&quot;, while two Lynx helicopters circled the ship.

==Disposal==

On 30 July 2008, &quot;Exeter&quot; was placed in a state of &#x27;extended readiness&#x27; at HMNB Portsmouth, until being decommissioned there on 27 May 2009.

In early 2010, &quot;Exeter&quot; was used to assist with the training of new naval base tugs. She was put up for sale by auction on 28 March 2011 and finally towed away to be scrapped at Leyal Ship Recycling in Turkey on 23 September 2011, provoking some criticism from former crew members who were upset that the Ministry of Defence had apparently failed to inform them of the ship&#x27;s fate.

<text>HMS &quot;Southampton&quot; was a batch two Type 42 destroyer of the Royal Navy. She was named after the city of Southampton, England, and built by Vosper Thornycroft, in Southampton. She was the sixth Royal Navy ship to bear the name.

==Operational service==
===1981–2005===
In 1984, &quot;Southampton&quot; ran over one of the Shambles Buoys off Portland during the final Thursday War intended to prepare her to deploy to the Falklands Islands. The collision sank the buoy and resulted in a period in dry dock for repair, after which &quot;Southampton&quot; left for a six-month deployment as a Falkland Islands guard ship.
On 3 September 1988, whilst serving on the Armilla Patrol, &quot;Southampton&quot; was involved in a collision with MV &quot;Tor Bay&quot;, a container ship in a convoy being escorted through the Straits of Hormuz. Three members of her crew were slightly injured and a hole torn in &quot;Southampton&quot;″s hull. The destroyer was returned to the UK aboard a semi-submersible heavy lift ship.

===2006–2011===
On 3 February 2006, the ship was involved in the seizing of of cocaine in the Caribbean.

==Fate==
On 31 July 2008, &quot;Southampton&quot; was placed in a state of &quot;Extended Readiness&quot; and was decommissioned on 12 February 2009. The ship was auctioned on 28 March 2011 and was later towed from Portsmouth on 14 October 2011 to Leyal Ship Recycling&#x27;s scrapyard in Aliağa, Turkey.

<text>HMS &quot;Gloucester&quot; was a Batch 3 Type 42 destroyer of the Royal Navy, built by Vosper Thorneycroft at Woolston, Southampton and launched on 2 November 1982 by The Duchess of Gloucester. &quot;Gloucester&quot; was one of the modified last four of the class to be built, having a lengthened hull design giving better seakeeping qualities, greater endurance and an external &#x27;strake&#x27; to counter longitudinal cracking, seen on earlier ships of the type.

==History==
In January 1987 &quot;Gloucester&quot; sailed for her first deployment; Armilla patrol, protecting civilian ships transiting the Strait of Hormuz. Port visits included Djibouti City; Sharjah; Manama; Karachi; Mombasa and Naples, returning to her homeport in June 1987.

In January 1988 the ship again deployed to the Gulf for an Armilla patrol. Port visits this time included Bahrain; Dubai; Mombasa and Rhodes. Further visits were planned but these were curtailed due to increasing tensions in the region.

In April 1989 &quot;Gloucester&quot; deployed westbound to perform duties as West Indies Guard Ship. Port visits included Nassau, Bahamas; Anguilla; Antigua; British Virgin Islands; Kingston, Jamaica; Acapulco; Long Beach, California; San Francisco and West Palm Beach.

===First Gulf War===
&quot;Gloucester&quot; served in the Persian Gulf War in 1991 under the command of Commander (later Rear Admiral) Philip Wilcocks where her most notable action was to shoot down an Iraqi Silkworm missile with Sea Dart missiles. The Iraqi missile had targeted the US battleship and the intercept was the first validated, successful missile-versus-missile strike of its kind.

After a missile warning, both the USS &quot;Missouri&quot; and fired flares and chaff to decoy the missile. &quot;Gloucester&quot;, drawing from the Royal Navy&#x27;s experience during the Falklands War, when Exocet missiles sank the merchant ship &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; after decoys were deployed, did not activate her own decoys. The Royal Navy considered missiles like the Silkworm as targets to be shot down and firing chaff made that action difficult. &quot;Gloucester&quot; initiated a hard turn, firing two Sea Darts &quot;over her starboard shoulder&quot;. The entire engagement, from detection to destruction, took just 89 seconds. The interception range was between 2¾ and 4 nautical miles away from &quot;Gloucester&quot;, and 4 to 7 nautical miles away from &quot;Missouri&quot;. USS &quot;Jarrett&quot;‘s history listed the missile&#x27;s altitude at 375 feet while witnesses aboard HMS&quot; London&quot; estimated between 680 and 1,000 feet.

Later, &quot;Missouri&quot;‘s 16-inch guns destroyed the Iraqi missile battery.

&quot;Gloucester&quot; avoided two naval mines, conducted boardings and the ship&#x27;s Lynx helicopter destroyed several Iraqi warships including three fast attack craft, a T43 minelayer, and a Polnocny-class landing ship, with Sea Skua missiles. She spent the longest period in the combat area of any coalition warship and her captain (Commander Philip Wilcocks) and flight commander (Lt Cdr David Livingstone) were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross with the operations officer and flight observer both mentioned in Despatches. After this service &quot;Gloucester&quot; was rebranded &quot;The Fighting G&quot;, after the earlier HMS &quot;Gloucester&quot;, a Town-class cruiser, sunk by German aircraft, in May 1941.

===Later Deployments===
In 1997, &quot;Gloucester&quot; took part in Ocean Wave 97. Ocean Wave lasted 8 months, which saw her visit countries including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and the UAE as well as taking part in the Five Power Defence Arrangements Exercise Flying Fish. She sailed as part of Task Group 327.01, under the flag of Commander United Kingdom Task Group, Rear Admiral Alan West, along with the flagship and other ships such as and support ships. Part of the role of the Task Force was to oversee the peaceful handover of Hong Kong to the Chinese.

During the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, &quot;Gloucester&quot; was the first Royal Navy vessel to evacuate British nationals from Beirut, berthing on 18 July 2006. She made three trips taking evacuees to Cyprus, and was the last Royal Navy ship to leave Beirut. She underwent a £6 million refit at Rosyth Dockyard in Fife, Scotland, in 2007. On the morning of 26 August 2010 she intercepted the yacht &quot;Tortuga&quot;, smuggling £4 million of cocaine, during &quot;Gloucester&quot;″s voyage out to the Falkland Islands, where she was deployed from August 2010 to early 2011. On 20 September 2010 the government of Uruguay denied &quot;Gloucester&quot; access to Montevideo as a result of the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute.

In May 2011, she took part in Exercise Saxon Warrior. As part of Saxon Warrior &#x27;11, on 21 May 2011, Carrier Strike Group 2&#x27;s and joined the U.S. replenishment tanker and the in conducting a transit exercise, with &quot;Gloucester&quot; and frigate acting as hostile forces. This was the final deployment for &quot;Gloucester&quot; prior to her decommissioning.

==Decommissioning==
&quot;Gloucester&quot; returned to HMNB Portsmouth for the final time on 24 May 2011 and was decommissioned on 30 June 2011, under the command of her last captain, Commander David George. On 22 September 2015 she left Portsmouth harbour under tow, bound for a breaker&#x27;s yard in Turkey. During her service she sailed 787,928 miles (1,268,047 km)

On decommissioning, Commander David George, said:

&quot;I cannot express how proud I am of the ship. It was a very emotional final entry for the very best of ships, but she is 29 years old, and with more than 750,000 miles [1.2m kilometres] under her belt. There are more capable Type 45 destroyers now taking the stage, and Gloucester’s time has come to bow out with dignity.&quot;

==Affiliations==
The ship retains links with the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment and the City of Gloucester. The ship&#x27;s crest features a horseshoe, part of the city&#x27;s Tudor arms.

<text>A sheela na gig is a figurative carving of a naked woman displaying an exaggerated vulva. These carvings, from the Middle Ages, are architectural grotesques found throughout most of Europe on cathedrals, castles, and other buildings.

The greatest concentrations can be found in Ireland, Great Britain, France and Spain, sometimes together with male figures. Ireland has the greatest number of surviving sheela na gig carvings; Joanne McMahon and Jack Roberts cite 124 examples in Ireland and 45 examples in Britain. One of the best examples may be found in the Round Tower at Rattoo, in County Kerry, Ireland. There is a replica of the Round Tower sheela na gig in the County Museum in Tralee town. Another well-known example may be seen at Kilpeck in Herefordshire, England.

The carvings may have been used to ward off death, evil and demons. Other grotesque carvings, such as gargoyles and hunky punks, were frequently part of church decorations all over Europe. It is commonly said that their purpose was to keep evil spirits away (see apotropaic magic). They often are positioned over doors or windows, presumably to protect these openings.

==Origin==
Scholars disagree about the origins of the figures. James Jerman and Anthony Weir believe the sheela na gigs were first carved in France and Spain during the 11th century; the motif eventually reached Britain and then Ireland in the 12th century. Jerman and Weir&#x27;s work was a continuation of research begun by Jorgen Andersen, who wrote &quot;The Witch on the Wall&quot; (1977), the first serious book on sheela na gigs. Eamonn Kelly, Keeper of Irish Antiquities at the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin, draws attention to the distribution of sheela na gigs in Ireland to support Weir and Jerman&#x27;s theory; almost all of the surviving &quot;in situ&quot; sheela na gigs are found in areas of Anglo-Norman conquest (12th century). The areas which remained governed by native Irish have few sheela na gigs. Weir and Jerman also argue their location on churches and the grotesque features of the figures, by medieval standards, suggests they represented female lust as hideous and sinfully corrupting.

Another theory, espoused by Joanne McMahon and Jack Roberts, is the carvings are remnants of a pre-Christian fertility or mother goddess religion. They note what they claim are differences of materials and styles of some sheela na gigs from their surrounding structures, and noting some are turned on their side, to support the idea they were incorporated from previous structures into early Christian buildings.

==Etymology==
The name was first published in the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy&quot; 1840–1844, as a local name for a carving once present on a church gable wall in Rochestown, County Tipperary, Ireland; the name also was recorded in 1840 by John O&#x27;Donovan, an official of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, referring to a figure on Kiltinan Castle, County Tipperary. Scholars disagree about the origin and meaning of the name in Ireland, as it is not directly translatable into Irish. Alternative spellings of &quot;Sheela&quot; may sometimes be encountered; they include &quot;Sheila&quot;, &quot;Síle&quot; and &quot;Síla&quot;. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, it is derived from Irish, &quot;Síle na gcíoch&quot;, meaning &quot;Julia of the breasts&quot;.

Jørgen Andersen writes that the name is an Irish phrase, originally either &quot;Sighle na gCíoch&quot;, meaning &quot;the old hag of the breasts&quot;, or &quot;Síle ina Giob&quot;, meaning &quot;Sheila (from the Irish &quot;Síle,&quot; the Irish form of the Anglo-Norman name Cecile or Cecilia) on her hunkers&quot;. Patrick S. Dinneen also gives &quot;Síle na gCíoċ&quot;, stating it is &quot;a stone fetish representing a woman, supposed to give fertility, generally thought to have been introduced by the Normans.&quot; Other researchers have questioned these interpretations – few sheela na gigs are shown with breasts – and expressed doubt about the linguistic connection between &quot;ina Giob&quot; and &quot;na Gig&quot;. The phrase &quot;sheela na gig&quot; was said to be a term for a hag or old woman.

Barbara Freitag devotes a chapter to the etymology of the name in her book &quot;Sheela-Na-Gigs: Unravelling an Enigma&quot;. She documents references earlier than 1840, including a Royal Navy ship &quot;Sheela Na Gig&quot; HMS Shelanagig (1780), and an 18th-century dance called the Sheela na gig. The Irish slip jig, first published as &quot;The Irish Pot Stick&quot; (c.1758), appears as &quot;Shilling a Gig&quot; in Brysson&#x27;s &quot;A Curious Collection of Favourite Tunes&quot; (1791) and &quot;Sheela na Gigg&quot; in Hime&#x27;s &quot;48 Original Irish Dances&quot; (c.1795). These are the oldest recorded references to the name, but do not apply to the architectural figures. The Royal Navy&#x27;s records indicate the name of the ship refers to an &quot;Irish female sprite&quot;. Freitag discovered that &quot;gig&quot; was a Northern English slang word for a woman&#x27;s genitals. A similar word in modern Irish slang () also exists, further confusing the possible origin of the name.

Weir and Jerman use the name sheela for the figure because it had entered popular usage; they also term figures of both sexes &quot;exhibitionist&quot;. They cite Andersen&#x27;s second chapter as a good discussion of the name. Andersen says there is no evidence that &quot;sheela na gig&quot; was ever a popular name for the figures when they were created. It began during the mid-19th century &quot;where popular understanding of the characteristics of a sheela were vague and people were wary of its apparent rudeness&quot;. An earlier reference to the dubious nature of the name is made by H. C. Lawlor in an article in &quot;Man&quot; Vol. 31, January 1931 (Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland), in which he writes, &quot;The term &#x27;sheela-na-gig&#x27; has no etymological meaning and is an absurd name.&quot; Andersen, Weir and Jerman, and Freitag all dismiss the name as being modern and somewhat arbitrary.

The oldest recorded name for one of the figures is &quot;The Idol&quot;, which relates to the figure at Holy Cross Church in Binstead on the Isle of Wight. This name was mentioned by R. Worsley in his &quot;The History of the Isle of Wight&quot; (1781) and noted also by J. Albin in &quot;A New, Correct, and Much-improved History of the Isle of Wight&quot; (1795) (Andersen page 11). The name &quot;The Idol&quot; also was applied to a now lost figure in Lusk, Ireland and was recorded as being in use around 1783.

==Hypotheses==
Much of the disagreement among scholars about these figures concerns exactly what they are meant to represent, and no theory explains all the figures.

===Survival of a pagan goddess===
A popular hypothesis is sheela na gigs represent a pagan goddess, but academics believe the situation was more complex, with multiple interpretations and roles for the female character as spiritual traditions changed over time. The goddess in question usually is identified as Celtic, the hag-like &quot;Cailleach&quot; figure of Irish and Scottish mythology. Margaret Murray proposed this, as did Anne Ross, who wrote in her essay &quot;The Divine Hag of the Pagan Celts&quot;, &quot;I would like to suggest that in their earliest iconographic form they do in fact portray the territorial or war-goddess in her hag-like aspect&quot;. Georgia Rhoades suggests the figures may represent the crone or an earth goddess from Celtic mythology.

Mircea Eliade&#x27;s &quot;The Encyclopedia of Religion&quot; (1993) draws parallels between the sheela na gig and the ancient Irish myth of the goddess who granted kingship. She would appear as a lustful hag, and most men would refuse her advances, except for one man who accepted. When he had relations with her, she was transformed into a beautiful maiden who would confer royalty onto him and bless his reign. There are additional variants of this common Northern European motif (see &quot;Loathly lady&quot;). Andersen devotes a chapter to this theory, entitled &quot;Pagan or Medieval&quot;. While suggesting possible pagan influences on Irish sheela na gigs, he considers them as having a medieval context. He argues that pagan origins are less likely than influence from the continent during the medieval period: &quot;What can be said against it, is that it is less easily proved and can be less easily illustrated than the possible continental, French origin for the motif discussed in earlier chapters&quot; (&quot;The Witch on the Wall&quot;, p. 95).

Weir and Jerman explore the possible influence of the ancient Greek Baubo figurine on the motif, but they acknowledge the link is tenuous. They write, &quot;It makes for very interesting speculation, but the amount of evidence is not large&quot;.

Freitag explores possible Celtic pagan origins, but finds little to suggest a link; &quot;in particular the notion of the divine hag being a portrayal of the Ur-Sheela has to be firmly dismissed as wayward conjecture&quot; (&quot;Sheela na gigs: Unravelling an Enigma&quot;, page 41). Although scholars have used evidence to reject the theory, it is popularly held.

===Fertility===

This hypothesis usually is combined with the &quot;goddess&quot; explanation. Barbara Freitag suggests the figures were used in a fertility context and associate them with &quot;birthing stones&quot;. There is folkloric evidence of at least some of the sheela na gigs being used in this manner, with the figures being loaned out to women in labour. Other examples are associated with wedding traditions. According to Margaret Murray, the figure in Oxford at the church of St Michael at the North Gate has an associated tradition of being shown to brides on their wedding day. This theory does not seem to apply to all the figures: some are thin with their ribs showing and thin breasts, which do not suggest fertility. Others are plump and are shown in a sexual context with a partner (as at Whittlesford). Theresa Oakley and Alex Woodcock recently discovered an exhibitionist couple at Devizes, who seem to represent fertility. The faces of some figures are striated, indicating scarring or tattoos. Weir notes a close examination of the figures reveals features which are not consistent with a fertility function.

===Warning against lust===
Weir and Jerman suggested the sheela na gigs served to warn against lust. They see the figures as a religious warning against sins of the flesh. Exhibitionist figures of all types—male, female, and bestial—are found frequently in the company of images of beasts devouring people and other hellish images. These images, they argue, were used as a means of religious instruction to a largely illiterate populace. As part of this interpretation, they explore a continental origin for the figures. Andersen first suggested this origin, and Weir and Jerman continued and expanded this line of inquiry. They argue the motif migrated from the continent via the pilgrim routes to and from Santiago de Compostela. (Freitag argues against this.) Pilgrim sculptors noted what they had seen on the route and ended up carving their own interpretations of the motifs. Eventually, the exhibitionist motif was transferred to Ireland and Britain. This theory seems to accommodate many of the religious figures but relates less well to some of the secular ones. Images carved on castles would not seem to be serving a religious purpose. The figure at Haddon Hall appears on a stable (although this may have been moved from elsewhere). The theory does not seem to apply to all the figures.

===Protection against evil===

Andersen and Weir and Jerman think the figures may also have been used as protection against evil. This would explain the use of the figures on structures such as castles. They served an apotropaic function, designed to ward off evil. In Ireland, some of the figures were called &quot;The Evil Eye Stones&quot;, which supported their theory. Some folkloric evidence is known of anasyrma (skirt-lifting) being used by women to ward off evil spirits.

Andersen reproduces an 18th-century illustration by Charles Eisen from La Fontaine&#x27;s &quot;Nouveaux Contes&quot; (1764) showing a demon being repulsed by the sight of a woman lifting her skirt to display her genitals.

Weir and Jerman relate a story from &quot;The Irish Times&quot; (23 September 1977) in which a potentially violent incident involving several men was averted by a woman exposing her genitals to them. They doubt, however, whether the story was true. Weir and Jerman go on to suggest that the apotropaic function seems to have been gradually ascribed to the figures over time. While this theory seems to apply to most of the secular and some of the religious figures, it does not apply to all of them.

===Feminist reinterpretation of the image===
Feminist scholarship has reinterpreted the concept of the sheela na gig especially in terms of the image as evil or embodiment of sin. Feminists have adopted the image as an icon with feminist authors viewing the sexuality of the sheela na gig more positively as an empowering figure. Reverence for female sexuality and vulvas can be seen in the art of Judy Chicago&#x27;s &quot;The Dinner Party&quot; and &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; by Eve Ensler. In &quot;Wide-open to Mirth and Wonder&quot;, Luz Mar González-Arias argues that the creative re-imagining of this medieval female figure can &quot;encourage contemporary women to stop perceiving their own corporeality as a heavy, awkward and shameful burden of guilt&quot;. Irish writer Molly Mullin&#x27;s essay &quot;Representations of History, Irish Feminism, and the Politics of Difference&quot; claims that the image of the Sheela na gig has almost become emblematic of Irish feminism as a force for hope and change. Scholar Georgia Rhoades argues that for many contemporary feminists the gesture of the Sheela&#x27;s unapologetic sexual display is &quot;a message about her body, its power and significance—a gesture of rebellion against misogyny, rather than an endorsement of it&quot;.

==Distribution==

As noted above, Ireland has the greatest number of known sheela na gigs. At one time, they were mistakenly thought to be a uniquely Irish practice; however, scholars realized that the sheela na gig motif could be found all over western and central Europe. Accurate numbers of figures are difficult to reach, as the interpretation of what is a sheela na gig will vary among scholars. For example, Freitag omits the Rochester figure from her list while Weir and Jerman include it. Concannon includes some worn figures which only she has identified as sheela na gigs. With renewed interest in the topic, scholars have recently identified previously unknown figures, so more could be discovered.

A significant number of figures are found in Romanesque contexts, especially in France, northern Spain, Britain, and Norway. In Ireland figures commonly are found in areas of Norman influence.

Contemporary examples can be found in Ireland as part of Project Sheela.

==Parallels==
The &quot;Encyclopedia of Religion&quot;, in its article on yoni, notes the similarity between the positioning of many sheela na gigs above doorways or windows and the wooden female figures carved over the doorways of chiefs&#x27; houses (&quot;bai&quot;) in the Palauan archipelago. Called &quot;dilukai&quot; (or &quot;dilugai&quot;), they are typically shown with legs splayed, revealing a large, black, triangular pubic area; the hands rest upon the thighs. The writers of the encyclopedia article say:

<text>The Syntax/Semantic Language (S/SL) is an executable high level specification language for recursive descent parsers, semantic analyzers and code generators developed by James Cordy, Ric Holt and David Wortman at the University of Toronto in 1980.

S/SL is a small programming language that supports cheap recursion and defines input, output, and error token names (&amp; values), semantic mechanisms (class interfaces whose methods are really escapes to routines in a host programming language but allow good abstraction in the pseudocode) and a pseudocode program that defines the syntax of the input language by the token stream the program accepts. Alternation, control flow and one-symbol look-ahead constructs are part of the language.

The S/SL processor compiles this pseudocode into a table (byte-codes) that is interpreted by the S/SL table-walker (interpreter). The pseudocode language processes the input language in LL(1) recursive descent style but extensions allow it to process any LR(k) language relatively easily. S/SL is designed to provide excellent syntax error recovery and repair. It is more powerful and transparent than Yacc but can be slower.

S/SL&#x27;s &quot;semantic mechanisms&quot; extend its capabilities to all phases of compiling, and it has been used to implement all phases of compilation, including scanners, parsers, semantic analyzers, code generators and virtual machine interpreters in multi-pass language processors.

S/SL has been used to implement production commercial compilers for languages such as PL/I, Euclid, Turing, Ada, and COBOL, as well as interpreters, command processors, and domain specific languages of many kinds. It is the primary technology used in IBM&#x27;s ILE/400 COBOL compiler, and the ZMailer mail transfer agent uses S/SL for defining both its mail router processing language and its RFC 822 email address validation.
