<text>Mehmed Nâzım Ran (17 January 1902 – 3 June 1963), commonly known as Nâzım Hikmet (), was a Turkish poet, playwright, novelist, screenwriter, director, and memoirist. He was acclaimed for the &quot;lyrical flow of his statements&quot;. Described as a &quot;romantic communist&quot; and a &quot;romantic revolutionary&quot;, he was repeatedly arrested for his political beliefs and spent much of his adult life in prison or in exile. His poetry has been translated into more than 50 languages.

==Family==
According to Nâzım Hikmet, he was of paternal Turkish and maternal German, Polish, French and Georgian descent. His mother came from a distinguished cosmopolitan family with predominantly-Circassian (Adyghe) roots, along with high social position and relations to the Polish nobility. From his father&#x27;s side, he had Turkish heritage. His father, Hikmet Bey, was the son of Mehmet Nâzım Pasha, after whom Nâzım Hikmet was named.

Nazım&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Hasan Enver Pasha, was the son of the Polish-born Mustafa Celalettin Pasha and Saffet Hanım, the daughter, Omar Pasha, a Serbian, and Adviye Hanım, a Circassian who was the daughter of Çerkes Hafız Pasha.

Mustafa Celalettin Pasha (born Konstanty Borzęcki herbu Półkozic) wrote (&quot;The Ancient and Modern Turks&quot;) in Istanbul in 1869. That is considered one of the first works of Turkish nationalist political thought.
Nâzım Hikmet&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Leyla Hanım, was the daughter of Mehmet Ali Pasha, of French Huguenot and German origin, and Ayşe Sıdıka Hanım, a daughter of Çerkes Hafız Paşa. Nâzım Hikmet and Celile Hanım&#x27;s cousins included Oktay Rifat Horozcu, a leading Turkish poet, and the statesman Ali Fuat Cebesoy.

==Early life==

Nâzım was born on 15 January 1902, in Selânik (Salonica), where his father was serving as an Ottoman government official. He attended the Taşmektep Primary School in the Göztepe district of Istanbul and later enrolled in the junior high school section of the prestigious Galatasaray High School in the Beyoğlu district, where he began to learn French. However, in 1913, he was transferred to the Numune Mektebi, in the Nişantaşı district. In 1918, he graduated from the Ottoman Naval School on Heybeliada, one of the Princes&#x27; Islands, in the Sea of Marmara. His school days coincided with a period of political upheaval, during which the Ottoman government entered the First World War and was allied with Germany. For a brief period, he was assigned as a naval officer to the Ottoman Navy cruiser &quot;Hamidiye&quot;, but in 1919 he became seriously ill and was not able to fully recover. That got him exempted from naval service in 1920.

In 1921, together with his friends Vâlâ Nureddin (Vâ-Nû), Yusuf Ziya Ortaç and Faruk Nafiz Çamlıbel, he went to İnebolu in Anatolia to join the Turkish War of Independence. From there he, together with Vâlâ Nûreddin, walked to Ankara, where the Turkish liberation movement was headquartered. In Ankara, they were introduced to Mustafa Kemal Pasha, later called Atatürk, who wanted the two friends to write a poem that would invite and inspire Turkish volunteers in Istanbul and elsewhere to join their struggle. The poem was much appreciated, and Muhittin Bey (Birgen) decided to appoint them as teachers to the Sultani (high college) in Bolu, rather than to send them to the front as soldiers. However, their communist views were not appreciated by the conservative officials in Bolu and so both of them decided to go to Batumi in the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic to witness the results of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and arrived there on 30 September 1921. In July 1922, both friends went to Moscow, where Ran studied Economics and Sociology at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East in the early 1920s. There, he was influenced by the artistic experiments of Vladimir Mayakovsky and Vsevolod Meyerhold, as well as the ideological vision of Vladimir Lenin.

== Convictions and prison sentences in Turkey ==
Nazım Hikmet Ran, being a communist, and publishing works that promotes socialism, attracted the attention of the Turkish government in 1931. A Lawsuit was filed against him with the accusation of &quot;making communist propaganda&quot; because of his poems and writings (&quot;Jokond ile Si-ya-u, Varan 3, Sesini Kaybeden Şehir).&quot; He was found not guilty on 7 May 1931.

He was arrested and sent to prison on 18 March 1933, for allegedly &quot;promoting communism&quot; with his book &quot;Gece Gelen Telgraf.&quot; On 29 July 1933, He was found guilty and sentenced to 6 months and 3 days in prison, and in August he was found guilty of insulting Süreyya İlmen, and sentenced to 1 year in prison. He was also ordered to pay 200 liras fine and 500 liras compensation. On 31 January 1934, Nazım Hikmet was found guilty on other charges related to promoting communism and sentenced to 5 years of prison, but this decision was not enforced because of the general amnesty of 1935, which set him free.

He received his longest prison sentences in 1938, when he was found guilty of &quot;inciting military mutiny&quot; and sentenced to 13 years and 4 months in prison, and he received another prison sentence of 15 years with the allegation that he gave directives on how to spread communism in the army in order to spread the principles of socialism within the armed forces and transform the country into a communist state through a revolutionary movement. His total sentence was announced as 28 years and 4 months by the court, with no reduction in the sentence. He served his prison sentence at different prisons in Ankara, Çankırı, Bursa and İstanbul.

However, he was released in 1950 with an amnesty, which took place due to protests against the Turkish government at that time, demanding Nazım Hikmet to be released. Many intellectuals around the world such as Albert Camus and Jean Paul Sartre joined the protests, and famous Turkish authors Orhan Veli Kanık, Oktay Rıfat and Melih Cevdet Anday went on a 3-day hunger strike.

Nazım was released after these protests and he escaped from Turkey to USSR on 17 June 1951. On 25 July 1951, the government stripped him of his Turkish citizenship.

==Style and achievements==
Despite writing his first poems in syllabic meter, Nazım Hikmet distinguished himself from the &quot;syllabic poets&quot; in concept. With the development of his poetic conception, the narrow forms of syllabic verse became too limiting for his style, and he set out to seek new forms for his poems.

He was influenced by the young Soviet poets who advocated Futurism. On his return to Turkey, he became the charismatic leader of the Turkish avant-garde by producing streams of innovative poems, plays and film scripts.

In Moscow in 1922, he broke the boundaries of syllabic meter, changed his form and began writing in free verse.

He has been compared by Turkish and non-Turkish men of letters to such figures as Federico García Lorca, Louis Aragon, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Yiannis Ritsos, and Pablo Neruda. Although Ran&#x27;s work bears a resemblance to these poets and owes them occasional debts of form and stylistic device, his literary personality is unique in terms of the synthesis he made of iconoclasm and lyricism, of ideology and poetic diction.

Many of his poems have been set to music by the Turkish composer Zülfü Livaneli and by Cem Karaca. Part of his work has been translated into Greek by Yiannis Ritsos, and some of the translations have been arranged by the Greek composers Manos Loizos and Thanos Mikroutsikos.

Because of his political views, his works were banned in Turkey from 1938 to 1965.

==Later life and legacy==
Nâzım&#x27;s imprisonment in the 1940s became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; among intellectuals worldwide. A 1949 committee that included Pablo Picasso, Paul Robeson, and Jean-Paul Sartre campaigned for his release.
On 8 April 1950, Nâzım began a hunger strike to protest the Turkish Parliament&#x27;s failure to include an amnesty law in its agenda before it closed for the upcoming general election. He was then transferred from the prison in Bursa, first to the infirmary of Sultanahmet Jail, in Istanbul, and later to Paşakapısı Prison. Seriously ill, Ran suspended his strike on 23 April, National Sovereignty and Children&#x27;s Day. His doctor&#x27;s request to treat him in hospital for three months was refused by officials. As his imprisonment status had not changed, he resumed his hunger strike on the morning of 2 May.

Nâzım&#x27;s hunger strike caused a stir throughout the country. Petitions were signed and a magazine named after him was published. His mother, Celile, began a hunger strike on 9 May, followed by the renowned Turkish poets Orhan Veli, Melih Cevdet and Oktay Rıfat the next day. In light of the new political situation after the 1950 Turkish general election, held on 14 May, the strike ended five days later, on 19 May, Turkey&#x27;s Commemoration of Atatürk, Youth and Sports Day, when he was finally released by a general amnesty law enacted by the new government.

On 22 November 1950, the World Council of Peace announced that Nâzım was among the recipients of the International Peace Prize, along with Pablo Picasso, Paul Robeson, Wanda Jakubowska and Pablo Neruda.

Later on, Nâzım escaped from Turkey to Romania on a ship via the Black Sea and from there moved to the Soviet Union. Because the Soviet bloc recognized the Turkish minority only in communist Bulgaria, the poet&#x27;s books were immediately brought out in this country, both in Turkish originals and in Bulgarian translations. The communist authorities in Bulgaria celebrated him in Turkish and Bulgarian publications as &#x27;a poet of liberty and peace.&#x27; The goal was to discredit Turkey presented as a &quot;lackey of the imperialist&quot; United States in the eyes of Bulgaria&#x27;s Turkish minority, many of whom desired to leave for or were expelled to Turkey in 1950–1953.

When the EOKA struggle broke out in Cyprus, Ran believed that its population could live together peacefully, and he called on the Cypriot Turks to support the Greek Cypriots&#x27; demand for an end to British rule and union with Greece (enosis). Hikmet drew negative reaction from Turkish Cypriots for his opinions.

Persecuted for decades by Turkey during the Cold War for his communist views, Nâzım died of a heart attack in Moscow on 3 June 1963 at 6.30 a.m. while he was picking up a morning newspaper at the door of his summer house in Peredelkino, far away from his beloved homeland. He is buried in Moscow&#x27;s Novodevichy Cemetery, where his tomb is still a place of pilgrimage for Turks and others from around the world. His final wish, which was never carried out, was to be buried under a plane tree (platanus) in any village cemetery in Anatolia.

His poems depicting the people of the countryside, villages, towns and cities of his homeland (&quot;Memleketimden İnsan Manzaraları&quot;, &quot;Human Landscapes from my Country&quot;), as well as the Turkish War of Independence (&quot;Kurtuluş Savaşı Destanı&quot;, i.e. &quot;The Epic of the War of Independence&quot;), and the Turkish revolutionaries (&quot;Kuvâyi Milliye&quot;, &quot;Force of the Nation&quot;) are considered among the greatest literary works of Turkey.

After his death, the Kremlin ordered the publication of the poet&#x27;s first-ever Turkish-language collected works in communist Bulgaria, where a large and recognized Turkish national minority still existed. The eight volumes of these collected works, &quot;Bütün eserleri&quot;, appeared at Sofia between 1967 and 1972, in the very last years of the existence of the Turkish minority educational and publishing system in Bulgaria.

Nâzım had Polish and Turkish citizenship. The latter was revoked in 1959 and restored in 2009. His family has been asked if it wanted his remains repatriated from Russia.

==Patronage==
During the 1940s, as he was serving his sentence at Bursa Prison, painted. There, he met a young inmate, İbrahim Balaban. Ran discovered Balaban&#x27;s talent in drawing, gave all his paint and brushes to him, and encouraged him to continue with painting. Ran influenced the peasant and educated him, who had finished only a three-grade village school, in forming his own ideas in the fields of philosophy, sociology, economics, and politics. Ran greatly admired Balaban and referred to him in a letter to the novelist Kemal Tahir as &quot;his peasant painter&quot; (). Their contact remained after they were released from the prison.

==Selected works==
===&quot;I Come and Stand at Every Door&quot;===

Nâzım&#x27;s poem &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Girl Child&quot;) conveys a plea for peace from a seven-year-old girl, ten years after she perished in the US atomic bomb attacks at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It has achieved worldwide popularity as a powerful anti-war message and has been performed and translated in many languages as a song by a number of singers and musicians both in Turkey and many countries. It is also known in English by various other titles, including &quot;I Come and Stand at Every Door&quot;, &quot;I Unseen&quot; and &quot;Hiroshima Girl&quot;.

*The usual tune is a nontraditional melody composed by Jim Waters in 1954 to fit the lyrics of Child 113 ballad &quot;The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry&quot;, which was recorded by American folksinger Joan Baez as &quot;Silkie&quot; on her second album Joan Baez, Vol. 2 in 1961.
*According to American activist folk musician Pete Seeger, Jeanette Turner did a loose English &quot;singable translation&quot; of the poem under a different title, &quot;I Come And Stand At Every Door&quot;, and sent a note to Seeger asking &quot;Do you think you could make a tune for it?&quot; in the late 1950s. After a week of trial and failure, the English translation was used by Seeger in 1962 with an adaptation of &quot;an extraordinary melody put together by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology student, James Waters, who had put a new tune to a mystical ballad &#x27;The Great Silkie&#x27; which he could not get out of his head, without permission.&quot; Seeger wrote in &quot;Where Have All the Flowers Gone?&quot;: &quot;It was wrong of me. I should have gotten his permission. But it worked. The Byrds made a good recording of it, electric guitars and all.&quot; Seeger also used the track in his 1999 compilation album &quot;Headlines &amp; Footnotes: A Collection Of Topical Songs&quot;.

<doc id="471672" wikidata="Q5287226" url="?curid=471672" title="Docklands, Victoria">
<text>Docklands is an inner-city suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, on the western end of the central business district. Docklands had a population of 15,495 at the 2021 census.

Primarily a waterfront area centred on the banks of the Yarra River, it is bounded by Spencer Street, Wurundjeri Way and Montague Street to the east, the Yarra River and Moonee Ponds Creek to the west, Footscray Road and Dynon Road to the north and Lorimer Street, Boundary Road and the West Gate Freeway across the Yarra River to the south.

The site of modern-day Docklands was originally swamp land that in the 1880s became a bustling dock area as part of the Port of Melbourne, with an extensive network of wharfs, heavy rail infrastructure and light industry. Following the containerisation of shipping traffic, Docklands fell into disuse and by the 1990s was virtually abandoned, making it the focal point of Melbourne&#x27;s underground rave scene. The construction of Docklands Stadium in the late 1990s attracted developer interest in the area, and urban renewal began in earnest in 2000 with several independent privately developed areas overseen by VicUrban, an agency of the Victorian Government. Docklands subsequently experienced an apartment boom and became a sought-after business address, attracting the national headquarters of, among others, the National Australia Bank, ANZ Bank, Myer, David Jones, Medibank and the Bureau of Meteorology, as well as the regional headquarters for Ericsson, Bendigo &amp; Adelaide Bank and television networks Nine and Seven.

Known for its contemporary architecture, the suburb is home to a number of heritage buildings that have been retained for adaptive reuse, and is also the site of landmarks such as the Docklands Stadium, Southern Cross railway station and the Melbourne Star.

Although still incomplete, Docklands&#x27; developer-centric planning has split public opinion with some lamenting its lack of green open space, pedestrian activity, transport links and culture.

==History==
===Early history===

Before the foundation of Melbourne, it was a large wetlands area of the Yarra River estuary consisting of a large salt water lagoon and a giant swamp at the mouth of the Moonee Ponds Creek. It was one of the open hunting grounds of the Wurundjeri people, who created middens around the edges of the lake. The lake was populated by fauna including native black swans and wild ducks as well and earlier, with its connection to Hobsons Bay, such marine life as snapper and swordfish.

In 1835, Vandemonian John Batman established a home on Batman&#x27;s Hill, marking the westernmost point of a new settlement. The rest of the area, however, remained largely unused for decades. The swamp, known as Batman&#x27;s Swamp, and later West Melbourne Swamp was a major source of nuisance to the colony, considered ugly and unsanitary and produced a strong unpleasant smell.

The first plans to reclaim the swamp issue were presented on 5 May 1858 by engineer Alexander Kennedy Smith to the Philosophical Institute of Victoria and proposed a system of three canals and a road to Footscray. While the reclamation did not proceed, the road did. Swamp Road (now Dynon Road) was completed in 1863 and included two bridges across the north of the lagoon.
The advent of rail infrastructure in the late 1860s saw the city&#x27;s industry gradually expand into the area. By 1878, Moonee Ponds Creek became a series of drainage canals with a system of bluestone constructions helping to funnel the salty water further south.

The earliest extensive plans to develop the area was in the 1870s, when a plan was prepared to extend the Hoddle Grid westward, following the curve of the Yarra River and effectively doubling its size. The plan proposed several gridlike blocks with an ornamental public garden and lake in the shape of the United Kingdom, occupying the site of the salt lake. However, expansion of the grid westward was abandoned in favor of a northward extension.

===Construction of Victoria Dock===

Under the guidance of British civil engineer John Coode, a major engineering project began in the 1880s to reroute the course of the Yarra River, which resulted in the widening of the river for shipping and the creation of a new Victoria Dock (the name was previously used by one at Queens Bridge as early as the 1850s). The dock was lined with wharves and light industry grew around the nearby western rail yards of Spencer Street railway station (now Southern Cross railway station), which were used for freighting the goods inland.

===Early to mid 20th century: From West Melbourne swamp to slum and new shipping port ===

During the wars, Victoria Dock was used as the main port for naval vessels and most of the Victorian troops returned from both wars to the docks.

In 1924 the Victorian Railways engineer Edward Ballard prepared designs for a new freight yards including a new Melbourne Yard and Spencer Street Yard and West Melbourne Dock (later Victoria Harbour) and an extension of Dudley Street westward and a new main road through West Melbourne which would later become Docklands Highway with land to be transferred to the Melbourne Harbour Trust. 

During the Great Depression era, the area along Moonee Ponds Creek was home to a large rubbish tip. Just across the creek (near the site of Costco) were Dudley Mansions, a notorious slum of half a dozen homes constructed from refuse which Frederick Oswald Barnett began photographing and actively campaigning against.

Construction of the new Victoria Harbour took place over the following decades and with shipping was moved from the Yarra turning basin at Queensbridge Victoria Dock became Melbourne&#x27;s busiest. 
===Disuse and rave epicentre===
With the introduction of containerisation of Victoria&#x27;s shipping industry in the 1950s and 1960s, the docks along the Yarra River, east of the modern Bolte Bridge, and within Victoria Harbour immediately to the west of the central business district, became inadequate for the new container ships.

The creation of Appleton Dock and Swanson Dock in an area west of the Moonee Ponds Creek, now known as West Melbourne, closer to the mouth of the Yarra, became the focus of container shipping, effectively rendering redundant a vast amount of vacant inner-city land to the immediate west of Melbourne&#x27;s CBD.

Docklands became notable during the 1990s for its underground rave dance scene. The growth of the warehouse rave scene carried on from the earlier gay and lesbian warehouse party scene which had started in the early 1980s, and continued in the Docklands through parties such as The ALSO Foundation&#x27;s Red Raw, Winterdaze, New Year&#x27;s Eve, and Resurrection dance parties.

The site was also host to a number of dance parties by Future Entertainment and Hardware Corporation. DJs and performers such as Paul van Dyk, Carl Cox, Jeff Mills, Frankie Knuckles, David Morales, Marshall Jefferson and BT headlined these events. The biggest event hosted, in terms of attendance, was the &quot;Welcome 2000&quot; New Year&#x27;s Eve dance party hosted on 31 December 1999.

===Urban renewal===
Docklands was seen as a large urban blight by the Cain Jr. State Government. Property consultants JLW Advisory carried out the first market demand assessment of the site.

The size of the Melbourne Docklands area meant that political influences were inescapable. The Docklands project was on top of the government&#x27;s agenda, however, due to the poor condition of the wharf infrastructure, a further investment was required to initiate the project, which the government at the time could not afford. Nevertheless, the Docklands project stayed on the drawing board, but with little progress. In 1989, several architectural firms were invited to discuss how the area could best serve the Melbourne public.

In 1990, the Docklands Task Force was established to devise an infrastructure strategy and conduct the public consultation process. The Committee For Melbourne, a not for profit organization that brought together the private sector of Melbourne for a public good, was pursuing another planning strategy. It involved a bid for the 1996 Olympic Games and another proposal to turn the Docklands into a technology city, known as the Multifunction Polis (MFP). Both bids fell through in late 1990. Nevertheless, the Committee For Melbourne&#x27;s approach became the preferred model in the proceeding strategies for the Docklands development, leading to the formation of the Docklands Authority in July 1991.

==== Kennett era and ARM Masterplan ====
With a government running in budget deficits, not much progress was made on the Docklands project. In late 1992, Jeff Kennett was elected Premier. Kennett instituted many changes and turned the government&#x27;s financial position around. He then embarked on a multitude of projects, which included Docklands. It was politically imperative to get the project rolling, the Docklands Authority opted for the concept of having infrastructure funded by the developers. The development industry supported this, and claimed that the project would be more efficient. Docklands was divided into sections or precincts, which were to be tendered to private companies to be developed.

May 1996 saw the relaunch of the tender process. Few restrictions were applied to the bids from developers, and as the vision was to make Docklands &#x27;Melbourne&#x27;s Millennium Mark&#x27;, the key criterion for a successful bid was to get projects going by 2000. It did not take long for the realisation that the lack of government coordination in infrastructure planning would create problems. Developers would not invest into public infrastructure, where benefits would flow on to an adjacent property. This was corrected by allowing developers to negotiate for infrastructure funding with the government. The Docklands Village precinct was planned for a residential and commercial mixed development, but, in late 1996, that plan was scrapped when it was announced a private football stadium would be built on the site. The site was chosen for its easy access to the then Spencer Street station (now Southern Cross station), and it was intended to be an anchor for the entire project and provide for a clear signal to the long-awaited start of the Docklands project. However, the stadium also created a huge barrier between the City and Docklands.
Work on the Bolte Bridge, designed by architects Denton Corker Marshall, for Transurban and constructed by Baulderstone Hornibrook, another architectural centrepiece took place from 1996 to 1999 and costing $75 million. 

In 1997, the Docklands commission engaged architects Ashton Raggatt McDougall (ARM) to design the Docklands masterplan incorporating the stadium, Victoria Dock and the Yarra on both sides of the Bolte Bridge. The whimsical futuristic design featured mostly curvy building frontages and winding thoroughfares. The centrepiece was an oval shaped central park (approximately the size of the Docklands Stadium field) accessed via a network of footbridges and surrounded by mid-sized towers from which a radial network of roads were lined by irregular curved footprints, each individually surrounded by zig-zagging lines of trees along the parks and open space. Vehicular traffic was minimised by a reduced road connectivity to encourage pedestrianisation. Harbour Esplanade was to be lined by low-rise commercial buildings such as restaurants to attract activity to the foreshore. The original plan featured integrated windbreaks to reduce the wind-tunnel effect. A wide promenade and framed park would directly connect Bourke Street and Lonsdale Streets to the new precinct (the present site of Southern Cross Station), effectively funnelling pedestrians from the CBD toward the new waterfront. Moonee Ponds Creek was connected to Victoria Dock via a winding channel creating additional waterfront and the precincts were dotted by small irregularly placed ponds, islands and boardwalks. Another small channel would have connected the Victoria Harbour waterway with the Yarra to the south allowing for more flow and less stagnant water. Central Pier was to be demolished and replaced by a peninsula of connected islands featuring green space and a walking path from which the whole precinct could be viewed. Moonee Ponds Creek would have been restored featuring a peninsula extending beyond the present Bolte Bridge adding a large park to the northern riverside frontage of the precinct.

==== Bracks/Brumby era: Redesign and Commencement of Construction (1998) ====

With the exception of &quot;Yarra Waters&quot; (later Yarra&#x27;s Edge) bid by Mirvac, bid for every other precinct between 1998 and 1999 fell through, reasons for which were often unclear due to secrecy provisions and a change of government.

Under a new government the ARM masterplan was largely abandoned for a new Docklands Public Realm Plan and a new planning committee was established in conjunction with the City of Melbourne. This new plan removed the wavy original masterplan in favour of a largely rectilinear plan. Significantly the new masterplan removed key pedestrian connections to the CBD at Lonsdale Street and called for an elevated concrete footbridge via Bourke Street, effectively isolating the northern parts of the precinct from the CBD (due to plans for the new Southern Cross Station). The large public plaza proposed on the railyards between Bourke and Lonsdale Street was excluded leaving a large and visually unappealing space which disconnects Docklands from the CBD. Instead of reducing the connections to the road network, a new north–south highway, Wurundjeri Way, would further bisect the precinct and disconnect it from the CBD. The new plan called for much taller, more built up areas of towers along the north and south of the harbour and toward the Hoddle Grid (present sites of New Quay and Yarra&#x27;s Edge and Batman&#x27;s Hill). Central pier was to be restored and retained instead of demolished. Many more marinas catered for more private boats at New Quay, Victoria Harbour and Yarra&#x27;s Edge than the original design, further reducing the amount of open water. Green space around the smaller and mid-sized buildings was removed in favour of footprints built to street frontage with laneways connecting each street between shorter podiums. More traditional avenues of street trees replaced irregular plantings, the ornamental ponds and floating walkways were removed in favour of long linear concrete promenades. Mixed-use low-rise along Harbour Esplanade which was aimed to increase activity along the foreshore was removed in order to widen the main thoroughfare. Docklands Park became a linear park flanked by shorter towers aligned north south with the Charles Grimes Bridge. Moonee Ponds Creek extension and restoration was also removed from the masterplan. The design also called for a wide Harbour Esplanade with no buildings along its foreshore lined by Canary Island Date Palms similar to the popular foreshores of Port Melbourne and Albert Park. 

Through the tendering process for the sites, the business park was split once more and awarded to two consortia, becoming Entertainment City (renamed Paramount Studios) - a movie theme park with film studios, to be developed by a Viacom led consortium, and Yarra Nova (which later evolved into NewQuay), to the MAB Corporation consortium. The Paramount Studios proposal fell through, and the site was put to tender once more, as Studio City, and later awarded as two parts, becoming what is now Docklands Studios Melbourne and Waterfront City.

Yarra Waters/Yarra Quays was awarded to Mirvac, later becoming Yarra&#x27;s Edge.

The technology park was renamed Commonwealth Technology Port (or Comtech Port) before finally becoming Digital Harbour.

A number of other sites also encountered false starts, with Victoria Harbour originally being awarded to Walker Corporation, before being put out to tender again and finally being awarded to Lendlease in April 2001. The Batman&#x27;s Hill precinct was originally awarded to Grocon, which had plans for what would have been the world&#x27;s tallest building rising 560 m, dubbed Grollo Tower and featuring a mix of office, apartment, hotel and retail. This deal also fell through with the site being subdivided into 15 parcels as well as No 2 Goods Shed.

On 1 July 2007 Docklands became part of the City of Melbourne Local Government Authority, however, VicUrban retained planning authority until 2010.


==Districts==
Following the initial Vicurban tender and the 1999 masterplan, Docklands was divided the land into a number of themed precincts, with each to be designed and built by a different development company. Overall governance was overseen by the Docklands Authority.
The precincts defined (from north to south) were:

Since the initial tendering process, other precincts and sub-precincts within these have emerged.

=== Northbank ===
Though not part of the 1999 masterplan or tendering process, the area of Docklands north of the Yarra opposite South Wharf from Spencer Street to Charles Grimes Bridge area around Siddeley Street originally including the part of North Wharf closest to the Hoddle grid is part of the gazetted land. It was rebranded as the Northbank precinct as other parts of Docklands began construction. At the time it consisted of a collection of a handful of existing buildings. Originally home to 1880s markets and industry including the Mission to Seamen building, between the 1920s and 1940s the area was almost completely cleared for a new port including Goods Shed number 5 and a large electric crane. By the 1970s, the majority of the area was covered by a parking lot with a petrol station and a small number of commercial buildings remaining from the 1920s era.

In the late 1970s, the disused port area was first earmarked for urban renewal aimed at extending CBD beyond the Hoddle grid along the river past Spencer Street. A small cluster of 1920s commercial buildings were cleared to construct the brutalist landmarks the blocky World Trade Center (1982) and semi-circular shaped Crowne Plaza Hotel (1988) along with a massive multi-storey carpark, Melbourne&#x27;s largest at the time, aimed to attract motorist commuters. However without permanent residents, like much of the CBD in the 80s the area proved unpopular and failed to attract activity despite the opening of Melbourne&#x27;s Melbourne&#x27;s first casino there, Crown Casino in 1994 and after its 1997 relocation to the permanent new site in Southbank, a temporary Madame Tussauds wax museum. Due to the precincts initial failure, development subsequently halted for over a decade.

Since the Docklands project the area has seen a growth of new interest in the long neglected precinct with over $1 billion in planned development. Flinders Wharf (2003) was one of the first new developments, adding 301 hi-rise apartments and mixed use to the riverfront. Relocation of Victoria Police headquarters to the World Trade Center offices and establishing a new police museum in 2007 was followed by redevelopment of the World Trade Centre as WTC Wharf (2008) aimed at stimulating further investment in the precinct. Mirvac have constructed a 20-storey office tower at 7 Spencer Street (2021). Melbourne Skyfarm (2021-23), a greening of the roof of the multi-storey carpark including sustainability centre, was aimed at softening the mostly harsh concrete area. 637 Flinders (2022) by Cox Architecture is seven storey modern infill office building added to the provide street frontage to the shorter World Trade Centre tower. Seafarers (2024), a mixed-use apartment building by architects Fender Katsalidis included a new public park known as Seafarers Rest and restaurants along a reconstructed Goods Shed 5.

Northbank is also a key part of the Greenline pedestrian and cycling link aimed at connecting Melbourne to the Docklands along the Yarra.

=== Batman&#x27;s Hill ===
The Batman&#x27;s Hill precinct is an 100,000 square metre area bordered by the Yarra River to the south, Spencer Street to the east, Docklands Stadium to the north and Victoria Harbour to the west. The precinct is named after the historical landmark Batman&#x27;s Hill, which was once located within the area.

It is a mixed-use precinct including commercial and retail space, entertainment, hotels, residential sections, restaurants, cultural sites and educational institutions as well as the historic Rail Goods Shed No. 2, which was split in half to allow for the extension of Collins Street into Docklands, providing businesses with an address that is considered to be prestigious. 

Fox Classic Car Museum in the Queens Warehouse was one of the first places to open in Batman&#x27;s Hill in 2000.
Completed buildings include:
* 700 Collins Street (home to the Bureau of Meteorology and Medibank) (2003)
* 750 Collins Street (the Melbourne headquarters of AMP) (2007)
* Watergate apartments and small office complex (2007)
* 737 Bourke Street (10 storey office building for headquarters of National Foods) (2008)
* Media House (2010) at 643 Collins Street. Built for Fairfax Media it comprises 16,000 m2 of office space accommodating 1,400 staff, on decking over railway lines opposite Southern Cross Station. The $110 million eight-storey facility was designed by architects Bates Smart to achieve a 5-star Green Star rating, and features a news ticker, outdoor screen and grassy plaza. It was developed by Grocon in 2009.
* 717 Bourke Street (17 storey building consisting of a 294-room Travelodge Hotel) (2011) 
* Kangan Institute&#x27;s Automotive Centre for Excellence (ACE) (2023)

On 2 August 2007, it was reported that a $1.5 billion scheme had been earmarked for Collins Street by Middle Eastern investment company Sama Dubai, to be designed by architect Zaha Hadid and Melbourne firm Ashton Raggatt McDougall. The plan would consist of four buildings, including Docklands&#x27; tallest tower as well as civic spaces spanning two sites to be built on decking over Wurundjeri Way. The proposed tower would have between 50 and 60 storeys tall but did not proceed and VicUrban put the site back out to tender in early 2011.

====Collins Square====
Collins Square (previously Village Docklands) is a ~2Ha site within the Batman&#x27;s Hill precinct. It was developed by Walker Corporation.

Collins Square is the outcome of a split of precincts in the tender process in 2000, which resulted in Goods Shed South, 735 Collins Street and Sites 4A-4F, originally awarded to the Kuok Group and Walker Corporation.

A masterplan prepared by Marchese + Partners in conjunction with Bligh Voller Nield architects was approved in early 2002. It included a 60-storey Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts tower with a Collins Street address and a mix of commercial and residential towers, as well as the refurbishment of the southern half of Goods Shed No. 2 into a night market and food hall.

In mid-2007, a new masterplan was prepared by Bates Smart. In it a new 38-storey office tower replaced the Shangri La Hotel on Collins Street and the number of streets is reduced from four to three, replaced by pedestrian thoroughfares. Overall there will now be five office buildings, ranging in height from 155m (to roof) to 36m, a 10,000sqm retail and public space, and the refurbishment of the Goods Shed with a &#x27;Lantern&#x27; structure addressing Collins Street. The entire precinct is aiming for a 5 Star Green Star rating.

Construction of Collins Square was completed in 2018.

===Stadium Precinct===
The Stadium Precinct, which sits on the eastern edge of Docklands, consists of Docklands Stadium, Seven Network&#x27;s Melbourne digital broadcasting centre, Victoria Point, Bendigo Bank offices, Medibank offices and serviced apartments. It is linked to Southern Cross station and the Melbourne CBD by the Bourke Street pedestrian bridge, built over railway lines.

During the 2000 Docklands development tender process, the stadium precinct was divided into four corners, the North West Stadium Precinct (NWSP), North East Stadium Precinct (NESP), South East Stadium Precinct (SESP) and South West Stadium Precinct (SWSP). The NWSP was awarded to Channel 7/Pacific Holdings. The NESP was awarded to Pan Urban. The SWSP was awarded to Devine Limited/RIA Property Group and the SESP - Bourke Junction Consortium (ISPT, CBUS Property and EPC Partners).

Docklands Stadium (originally Colonial Stadium) was opened in March 2000. The ability for the structure to have both open and closed roof configurations has seen it host many sports events, including Australian Rules Football, soccer, cricket and rugby as well as concerts. The stadium complex is currently managed by Stadium Operations Ltd, which is owned by the Seven Network, with ownership transferring to the Australian Football League in 2025.

Developer Pan Urban has announced plans for a $300 million twin-tower apartment development, known as Lacrosse Docklands, for the NESP, with the towers set to rise 21 and 18 storeys respectively, above the stadium concourse, with restaurants and bars opening out on to the concourse, forming a retail plaza.

Plans for the site to be known as &quot;Bourke Junction&quot; include office towers of 29 and 21 storeys on the north-eastern and south-western corners of the SESP site, as well as three lower-rise buildings housing a 250-room hotel, a pub, medical centre, retail facilities, a business club and a two-level gymnasium.

==== Harbour Esplanade and stadium redevelopments (2010-) ====
Due to concerns over the failed pedestrian activation of Harbour Esplanade, it was redeveloped between 2010 and 2011 at a cost of $9.2 million. The existing 23 10 metre tall palms and gum trees were replaced by 230 Norfolk Island pines (for a more stronger windbreak effect), realigned tram tracks to the centre roadway and new separated bicycle paths added. However the redevelopment failed in its objective to increase pedestrian activation of the foreshore. As a result, another $16 million redevelopment under a new Harbour Esplanade Masterplan was proposed to repair the degraded wharfs unsuitable for pedestrian activation and reinstate previously demolished sheds and introduce an avenue trees to the waterfront. In 2020 the heritage listed Central Pier and its Shed 9 and Shed 19 were permanently closed due to its deteriorating condition. By 2023 the government decided to demolish and replace the heritage listed Central Pier which had been a centrepiece of the revised 1999 masterplan. The project would cost a total of $550 million. The shutdown was estimated to cost a further $865 million to the economy and was the subject of legal action against the government by commercial tenants. In 2024 an additional $225 was committed by the government to redevelop the stadium in an attempt to activate the foreshore.

===Digital Harbour at Comtechport Precinct===
Digital Harbour is a waterfront that has an area of 44,000 square metres, with development intended to expand to include 220,000 square metres of commercial, residential, SOHO units and retail space. At present only three buildings have been completed; 1010 LaTrobe Street/Port 1010 (home to VicTrack, Australian Customs and Border Protection Service), and the Innovation Building (home of the Telstra Learning Academy and Innovation Centre). A third building, Life.lab currently resides at 198 Harbour Esplanade, while a fourth, 1000 La Trobe Street, is expected to commence shortly.

Port 1010 received the Commercial Architecture Award at the 2007 Victorian Architecture Awards, held on Friday 13 July.

The Digital Harbour Business Association was launched in 2011. This is a group of businesses established in the Digital Harbour precinct in the Docklands. The precinct is a destination for IT, Media and other related businesses. The aim of the association is to promote the businesses within Digital Harbour to the wider Docklands Community and the Melbourne CBD.
===Victoria Harbour===


The Victoria Harbour Precinct is the centrepiece of Docklands. The precinct includes Central Pier and the land south towards the Yarra along with an extension of Collins Street and Bourke Street to meet at the water&#x27;s edge. It has an area of 280,000 square metres, with 3.7 kilometres of waterfront. The 12-year construction plans for Victoria Harbour include residential apartments, commercial office space, retail space, community facilities and the development of public spaces such as Grand Plaza, Docklands Park and Central Pier.

One of the first completed office buildings in the precinct was the colourful National Australia Bank (NAB) headquarters, located at 800 Bourke Street, which accommodates approximately 3,600 staff. The building has large open floor plates, an atria, a campus-style workplace and a four-star energy rating.

Almost 1,000 Ericsson employees also call Victoria Harbour home, with the company&#x27;s new Melbourne offices at 818 Bourke Street. Ericsson House sits on the water&#x27;s edge next door to the National Australia Bank HQ and Dock 5 apartments

The first residential tower to be built at Victoria Harbour was Dock 5. Rising 30 storeys, it was designed by Melbourne firm John Wardle Architects and Hassell. Dock 5 derives its name from its location, which was known as Dock 5.

The Gauge, at 825 Bourke Street was built to house offices for developer Lendlease and Fujitsu. The eight-storey building was designed to achieve a six-star energy rating, becoming the second building in Docklands to do so.

A Safeway supermarket opened in Merchant Street (opposite The Gauge) in 2008, along with a number of other retail tenancies at street level, including Australia Post, a childcare centre, and offices above, which have been occupied by LUCRF Super and the National Union of Workers since 2008.

In 2009 the ANZ Bnak&#x27;s new world headquarters at 833 Collins Street have was completed. The office complex includes shops, car parking facilities and a YMCA. It enables 6,500 ANZ staff to work in one integrated area. The new ANZ headquarters, designed by Hassell and developed by Lendlease, was expected to become the largest office complex in Australia. Construction commenced in late 2006. It has been designed to achieve a six-star energy rating.

In 2007, Myer announced that it had chosen Victoria Harbour as the location for its new Corporate Store Support Offices. The new offices were built at 800 Collins Street, opposite ANZ.
===NewQuay===
NewQuay, opened in 2002, was one of the first residential and commercial developments in Docklands. It is a mixed-use precinct comprising a number of private residential, hotel accommodation, serviced apartment and retail/commercial properties, developed by the MAB Corporation. The flagship building, Palladio - which is shaped like the prow of a ship - is named after Italian architect Andrea Palladio. The podium building, Sant&#x27;Elia is named after another Italian architect, Antonio Sant&#x27;Elia. Other buildings are named after Australian artists: Nolan (Sidney Nolan), Arkley (Howard Arkley), Boyd (Arthur Boyd), and Conder (Charles Conder). In 2013, the construction of the twin residential towers &quot;The Quays&quot; was completed.

Aquavista, completed in May 2007, is a strata office development and the first commercial building to be completed in NewQuay, as part of the HQ NewQuay development. Another, the seven-storey 370 Docklands Drive, is currently under construction, with a further two buildings - Lots 5 &amp; 9 - currently under design development.

On 17 October 2007, MAB Corporation launched &#x27;The Avenues at NewQuay&#x27; development, consisting of three-storey townhouse residences, with park and waterfront frontages, to be built as part of NewQuay&#x27;s western precinct. The development is being designed by Plus Architecture.

The ground level podiums contain a commercial precinct with a variety of restaurants and cafes including Italian, Indian, Middle Eastern, Cantonese, Moroccan, Cambodian and Modern Australian cuisines.

===Yarra&#x27;s Edge===
Yarra&#x27;s Edge is a residential precinct being developed by Mirvac, and the only Docklands precinct south of the Yarra River. When complete, it will consist of 11 apartment towers, costing A$1.3 billion, and cover 0.15 km2.

A mix of restaurants, cafes and retail, including a day spa and a convenience store. Yarra&#x27;s Edge also has a 175-berth marina, giving boat owners previously unavailable proximity to Crown Casino and the city.

Yarra&#x27;s Edge was one of the first developments in Docklands, with construction of Tower 1 commencing in 2000. It is divided into 3 smaller precincts:

* Marina Precinct - Comprising the marina and boardwalk, with 5 tall residential towers ranging in height from 25 to 47 storeys:
* Park Precinct - Comprising Point Park and two residential towers
* River Precinct - Comprising a mix of lower-level, less intense terrace-style developments and three high-rise towers towards the Bolte Bridge

==== Webb Bridge ====

Webb Bridge is a bridge designed by Denton Corker Marshall, in collaboration with artist Robert Owen, forming a cycling and pedestrian link to the main part of Docklands, through Docklands Park. It is the conversion of the former Webb Bridge rail link.

==== Charles Grimes Bridge and Jim Stynes Bridge====
Charles Grimes Bridge is a dual-carriageway bridge that carries the Docklands Highway over the Yarra River. It was named after New South Wales surveyor general Charles Grimes, who was the first European to sight the Yarra. The bridge, built in 1975 and given its current name in 1983, predates the Docklands development but was connected the new Wurundjeri Way in 1999 to the West Gate Freeway.

The Jim Stynes Bridge was opened in 2014 to carry pedestrian and cyclist traffic underneath the Charles Grimes Bridge from Yarra&#x27;s Edge to Northbank area.

==== Greenline ====
The Greenline is a shared bicycle and pedestrian path that runs along the Northbank of the Yarra River connecting Yarra&#x27;s Edge to the Melbourne CBD and North Wharf Victoria Harbour, Docklands Esplanade and the Capital City Trail via the Web Bridge interchange.

===Waterfront City===

Waterfront City is a shopping and entertainment area that includes The District Docklands shopping mall, Melbourne Star Observation wheel, Icehouse ice sports and entertainment centre, and numerous shops and cafes which are centred on this area.

The precinct features an integration of retail, waterfront entertainment, tourism, dining, commercial and urban community. It has an area of 193,000 square metres.

Stage One was completed in December 2005, in time for the Melbourne stopover of the Volvo Ocean Race in January – February 2006 and the Commonwealth Games in March 2006. The precinct originally featured a large circus tent, which hosted the International Circus Spectacular, as well as a mosaic of local entertainers and a number of bronze statues, including Kylie Minogue, John Farnham, Graham Kennedy, Nellie Melba and Dame Edna Everage and a Melbourne Walk of Fame.

Stage Two includes a public entertainment area incorporating the Melbourne Star (previously Southern Star), a tall Ferris wheel in the shape of a seven-pointed star, and The District Docklands Shopping Mall. Waterfront city is home to Australia&#x27;s first Costco Warehouse Store.

In May 2017 Lord Mayor Robert Doyle and Planning Minister Richard Wynne visited The District Docklands to announce a $150 million redevelopment of the centre including an eight-screen Hoyts cinema, which opened in 2018, and a full-line Woolworths supermarket due mid-2019.

During 2017–2018, a collaboration between The District Docklands and Renew Australia allowed the creation of an initiative called the Docklands Art Collective, which made a wing of The District Docklands complex available at very low rents to arts businesses and galleries. These included a photography studio, a puppetry workshop, a comics retailer and printery, a recycled art paper maker and the relocated Blender Studios.

===Docklands Studios===

When it opened in 2004, Central City Studios became Melbourne&#x27;s largest film and television studio complex. The site is located approximately 2 km north west of the Central Business District. It has an area of 60,000 square metres and currently consists of five film and television sound stages.

The first major contract for the new studios was the American film &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; in 2005; with a budget of nearly $120 million, at the time it was the biggest feature film to be made in Victoria and features scenes involving Melbourne landmarks. Since then the studios have housed many international productions.

In 2009 the Government of Victoria, together with the Studios, undertook the Future Directions project. This resulted in the State Government committing the Studios to focus on both the international and domestic film and television industries. Further developments to the infrastructure of the site are planned, including a sixth sound stage.

On 11 October 2010 the studios were re-branded as Docklands Studios Melbourne, formally adopting the name by which the studios were commonly known.

==Transport==
Docklands has access to road, rail and water transports.

Docklands Highway or Wurundjeri Way is the main road through Docklands. It connects to the nearby Westgate Freeway on the southern end and links to the CBD including extensions from Flinders Street, Collins Street and La Trobe Street.

Southern Cross station, near the eastern edge of Docklands, is the closest passenger railway station. It is also the major interchange for metropolitan and intercity rail. Much of Docklands area remains covered by rail yards previously used for freight transport and rolling stock which are being progressively reclaimed or built over.

Trams in Docklands include the free City Circle tram, along Docklands Drive and to and from Waterfront City. As Docklands has developed, tram routes have been extended and rerouted into the area. Route 70 also runs to Waterfront City. Route 75 runs along Harbour Esplanade, terminating at Footscray Road. Routes 11 and 48 run along Collins Street to Victoria Harbour. Route 30 enters Docklands via La Trobe Street, terminating at the north end of Harbour Esplanade. Route 86 runs along La Trobe Street and Docklands Drive, terminating at Waterfront City.

Docklands also includes major pedestrian links with a concourse extending from Bourke Street and extensive promenades along the waterfront, including the wide Harbour Esplanade.

Several offroad bicycle paths run through Docklands, all of which connect through the central spine of Webb Bridge, Docklands Park and Harbour Esplanade, connecting Melbourne City Centre to the inner western suburbs and the Capital City Trail.

There are also three ferry terminals which connect Docklands to the Melbourne City Centre and inner bayside suburbs. One at Victoria Harbour, one at NewQuay and one at Yarra&#x27;s Edge.

== Sports and recreation ==

* The Docklands Stadium (currently known as Marvel Stadium), located just northwest of the Southern Cross railway station, is the home ground to five AFL football clubs (St Kilda, North Melbourne, Carlton, Essendon and Western Bulldogs) and one Big Bash League cricket team (Melbourne Renegades). It was also one of the venues for the 2003 Rugby World Cup and the 2006 Commonwealth Games, and hosted the 2015 Speedway Grand Prix of Australia.
* The O&#x27;Brien Icehouse, located between the Moonee Ponds Creek (accessible via the creek trail) and the Melbourne Star observation wheel, is the largest ice sports venue and the only dual-rink facility in Australia. It is the home to both of the two Victorian AIHL ice hockey teams, the Melbourne Ice and Melbourne Mustangs.
* The Docklands Sports Courts is a public urban park on Harbour Esplanade featuring two mixed-use court for basketball, netball, soccer/futsal and dodgeball and an outdoor ping-pong table, as well as children&#x27;s play parks and shading parasols. The Docklands Park is across the Esplanade, offering more green spaces with bicycle trails.

==Local media==
The precinct has two publications, Docklands News and 3008 Docklands Magazine.

The Docklands Community News&#x27; first edition was published in 2003, and both DCN &amp; 3008 Docklands Magazine have grown with the Docklands precincts&#x27; population. Both publications are printed and distributed to all businesses and residences within Docklands, which allows for a regular readership of over 10,000. The DCN paper informs the community of relevant news relating to Docklands as well as supplying residents, business owners and workers with a platform for community discussion.

3008 Docklands Magazine also covers all matters relating to the Docklands community and businesses, but also covers events and news pertaining to Melbourne City and the surrounding suburbs, as Docklands is under the jurisdiction of the City of Melbourne. 3008 Docklands Magazine is a glossy, well-produced, stylish publication which is both informative and interesting and has been well received by its reader base since its first issue back in May 2006. 3008 Docklands Magazine has a significant online following.

==Response and reception==

The planning of Docklands has raised a large amount of public debate and the area has created significant controversy, particularly the failed Ferris wheel.

In 1999, Melbourne City Council Director of Projects criticised the disconnection of the precinct to the CBD, claiming that the lack of transport links, particularly pedestrian, meant Docklands was &quot;seriously flawed&quot;.

The problem was exacerbated in 2005, when the pedestrian link between Lonsdale Street and Docklands proposed in 2001 was cut from the final design of the Southern Cross Station development due to budget blowouts.

In 2006, Royce Millar of &quot;The Age&quot; referred to it as a &quot;wasted opportunity&quot;.

In 2008, the City of Melbourne released a report which criticised Docklands&#x27; lack of transport and wind tunnel effect, lack of green spaces and community facilities.

In 2009, Neil Mitchell wrote for &quot;The Age&quot; declaring Docklands as a planning &quot;dud&quot;. The Lord Mayor, Robert Doyle, has been openly critical of Docklands, claiming in 2009 that it lacks any form of &quot;social glue&quot;.

However, despite the local criticism, in 2009, Sydney travel writer Mal Chenu described Melbourne Docklands as &quot;the envy of Sydneysiders&quot;.

In 2010, VicUrban&#x27;s general manager David Young acknowledged that Harbour Esplanade &quot;doesn&#x27;t stack up&quot;. Kim Dovey, professor of architecture and design at the University of Melbourne, added that Harbour Esplanade was &quot;too big&quot; and claimed that Docklands was &quot;so badly done&quot; that it required a &quot;major rethink&quot;.

The Docklands area came under heavy criticism for the failure to provide a school with families being forced out of the area or needing to commute to state schools already under pressure from the critical shortage of schools in the inner suburbs. A private school, Melbourne City School, opened on King Street in 2010 but closed in 2012 due to low enrollments. Docklands Primary School in NewQuay opened in January 2021. The Docklands Sports Club has run Junior Football and Cricket programs since Summer 2019.

George Savvides, CEO of Medibank, which has been based in Docklands since 2004, has been critical of the area&#x27;s lack of soul and amenity, but the company has nevertheless chosen to remain committed to the area.

=== &quot;Ghost town&quot; reputation and post COVID-19 Pandemic decline ===

In the late 2010s, the area developed a reputation as a ghost town due to rapidly declining activity. In 2022 the Victorian Liberal Party declared it as such, citing neglect and poor planning by successive governments causing an extreme lack of activity, especially due to the permanent closure of Central Pier in 2019. Docklands has consistently been labelled this way by the media post COVID-19 pandemic. By 2023 among the stark lack of activity was exacerbated by a trend of owner occupiers converting their residences to Airbnbs, Costco shutting its flagship store, several prominent businesses closing their doors, and the Walk of Stars being permanently relocated elsewhere.

==Public art ==
There are approximately 68 pieces of public art in the Docklands Precincts, with works from Australian and New Zealand artists. There are self-guided tours and maps available for the public to discover the artworks.

==Notable residents==
* Sally Capp – 104th Lord Mayor of Melbourne (Victoria Harbour)
* Sam Newman – former AFL player and sportscaster (Yarra&#x27;s Edge)

<text>Alhurra ( &quot;&quot; , &quot;the Free One&quot;) is a U.S. government-owned Arabic-language satellite TV channel that broadcasts news and current affairs programming to audiences in the Middle East and North Africa. Alhurra is funded by the U.S. government and is barred from broadcasting within the United States itself under the 1948 Smith-Mundt Act.

Its stated mission is to provide &quot;objective, accurate and relevant news and information&quot; to its audience while seeking to &quot;support democratic values&quot; and &quot;expand the spectrum of ideas, opinions, and perspectives&quot; available in the region&#x27;s media. The network has also tried to distinguish itself from its numerous regional competitors by providing access to more in-depth coverage of U.S. issues and policies and coverage of a broader range of opinions and perspectives than normally heard on other Arab television networks.

Alhurra began broadcasting on 14 February 2004 to 22 countries across the Middle East and North Africa. It has established itself as the third highest-rated pan-Arab news channel, surpassing viewership ratings for the BBC (English and Arabic), France 24 Arabic, RT Arabic, CCTV, CNNi, and Sky Arabia. 

In April 2004, an additional channel called Alhurra-Iraq was launched, featuring most of the Alhurra content, with additional programming specifically directed at the Iraqi audience. It is also broadcast on satellite and is available on terrestrial antennas throughout Iraq, including in Basra, and Baghdad.

==History==
The decision to launch Alhurra was prompted by frustration among U.S. government officials over perceived anti-American bias among the leading Arab television networks and the effect these channels were having on Arab public opinion regarding the U.S. Alhurra was intended to serve as an alternative to these channels by presenting the news in a more &quot;balanced and objective&quot; manner in an effort to improve the image of the United States in the Arab world.

The driving force behind the launch of Alhurra was Norman Pattiz, a media executive and founder and chairman of broadcast industry giant Westwood One. While serving as a member of the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), currently the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the U.S. federal agency that controls all foreign non-military radio and TV broadcasts, Pattiz advocated strongly for the creation of a U.S.-funded television network specifically directed at Arab audiences. Pattiz had also previously been responsible for the creation of Radio Sawa, a USAGM-administered Arabic-language radio network which broadcast a mix of music, entertainment, and news. The idea to launch Alhurra stemmed from the success that Radio Sawa had exhibited in reaching young audiences in the Middle East.

Pattiz believed that Arab audiences&#x27; views of the United States were being negatively influenced by existing Arab news networks&#x27; focus on coverage of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. He argued that by presenting a wider range of perspectives on these conflicts and other U.S. policies, as well as a coverage of a broader variety of regional and global issues of interest to Arab audiences, a U.S.-funded satellite TV channel could help improve America&#x27;s image in the region.

In an appearance on CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in May 2004, Pattiz described a powerful promotional video he helped produce which led to the successful launch of Alhurra:

:&quot;We showed the negative images that people get of the United States on Middle Eastern television,&quot; says Pattiz. &quot;There was lots of anti-U.S. demonstrations—burning the president in effigy, stomping on the American flag. We then said, &#x27;And this is what you see from America.&#x27; And we had about 4 seconds of black screen.&quot;

As a result of Pattiz&#x27;s efforts, the Bush administration requested funding for the channel from Congress, and obtained $62 million in funding for its first year of operation (including start-up costs). In the fall of 2003, construction began to renovate an old TV channel building in Springfield, VA into a modern broadcast facility for the new channel. Construction was completed less than six months later, and Alhurra&#x27;s first broadcast aired 14 February 2004.

==Organization and funding==

The MBN is a non-profit organization financed through a grant from the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), formerly the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), an independent federal agency funded by the U.S. Congress. The U.S. Agency for Global Media oversees all U.S. public broadcasting outlets and is intended to act as a firewall to protect the editorial independence and professional integrity of the broadcasters.

Alhurra&#x27;s headquarters are in Springfield, Virginia. The network also maintains bureaus in Baghdad and Dubai, production centers in Beirut, Jerusalem, Cairo, Rabat, Erbil and Washington, D.C., as well as correspondents throughout the Middle East, North Africa, the United States and Europe.

==Awards==
In 2019, Alhurra&#x27;s report &quot;Power of Forgiveness&quot; won the People&#x27;s Voice Award in the category of Best Documentary.

In 2016, Alhurra Television&#x27;s documentary series &quot;Delusional Paradise&quot; won the Silver Award at the Cannes Corporate Media &amp; TV Awards. And the promotional video for the &quot;Delusional Paradise&quot; won a bronze medal at the New York Festivals International Television &amp; Film Awards.

== Programming ==
Alhurra broadcasts 24 hours a day and, like other USAGM-run broadcasters, is commercial-free. In addition to reporting regional and international news, the channel provides information on a variety of subjects, including the rights of women, human rights, religious freedom, freedom of expression, health, entertainment news, sports, and science and technology. The network supplements its original programming with broadcasts of Arabic-subtitled versions of English-language programs familiar to U.S. (and global) audiences, such as PBS&#x27;s &quot;Frontline&quot; and &quot;NOVA&quot;, A&amp;E&#x27;s &quot;Biography&quot; and &quot;Modern Marvels&quot;. In addition, the network reversions and repackages prominent American news and news magazine series, such as the PBS &quot;Newshour&quot; and CBS’ &quot;60 Minutes&quot; into its own Arabic-language feature news programs.
Alhurra has over the years hosted a number of prominent politicians, journalists and intellectuals in one-on-one long format interviews. Guests have included many heads of state, Supreme Court justices, foreign ministers, national security advisers, secretaries of state, education, commerce and many White House Officials from both parties. Many journalists have appeared on Alhurra including Tom Friedman, David Brooks, and other prominent politicos such as Mary Matalin, Jalal Talabani, Paul Volcker, John Bolton, Terry McAuliffe, Joe Lieberman, Susan Turnbull, Robert Zimmerman, Steve Murphy, David Corn, Peter Fenn, Michael Steele, Tony Coehlo, Alon Ben-Meir, and Eleanor Clift.

== Viewership ==

Alhurra competes with more than 550 Arabic-language satellite TV channels for its audience in the Middle East, and as a result Alhurra initially struggled after its launch in 2004 to attract viewers in the already-crowded Arab media market. Annual surveys commissioned by the USAGM showed that Alhurra&#x27;s weekly audience grew by 28% between 2004 and 2008, surpassing 25 million. Recent surveys by international research organizations including ACNielsen show that Alhurra has consistently averaged approximately 26 million weekly viewers in its broadcast region from 2009 to 2011. While this number is dwarfed by the overall viewership of Qatar-funded channel Al Jazeera and Saudi Arabia-funded Al Arabiya, it is nevertheless greater than the viewership of all other non-indigenous Arabic-language news networks (including CNN Arabic, BBC Arabic and France24&#x27;s Arabic-language channel) combined. A USAGM-commissioned poll in February 2011 found that 25% of Egyptians living in Cairo and Alexandria tuned into Alhurra during the protests in that country in January 2011, surpassing Al Jazeera&#x27;s 22% viewership during the same period.

Although not a traditional viewership survey, University of Maryland/Zogby polls of several Arab nations (Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE) asked which channels viewers tuned into most often. Just 2% overall stated that Alhurra was the channel they turned to most often in 2008, and that number dropped to 1% in 2009 (this poll added Egyptian respondents).

However, the channel&#x27;s popularity has shown some signs of improvement in recent years, particularly in Iraq, which has proven to be Alhurra&#x27;s most successful market in the Arab world. A 2005 Ipsos poll found that just 14% of Iraqi respondents tuned into Alhurra (ranking 11th place). However, a 2008 Ipsos poll of Iraqi viewers found the network&#x27;s popularity had increased to 18%, overtaking Al Jazeera (15%). This improvement could be due to Alhurra&#x27;s launch of Alhurra-Iraq, an Iraq-focused channel with programming tailored especially to the Iraqi audience. In its FY2010 budget submission, the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), formerly the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), noted that the channel&#x27;s viewership had improved to 5th place in the Iraqi market.

==Threats to journalists==
Alhurra journalists and correspondents have frequently faced threats, intimidation, and violence from both government and non-state actors opposed to their coverage.

Some notable incidents include:
* In August 2012, Syrian authorities reportedly injured and detained Alhurra reporter, Bashar Fahmy.
* In June 2011, Yemeni authorities attacked an Alhurra reporter and photographer who were covering a sit-in taking place in front of the Vice President&#x27;s house in Sana&#x27;a.
* In March 2011, Alhurra reporter Abdel Karim Al-Shaibani was assaulted and beaten by unknown assailants on a street in Sana&#x27;a, Yemen.
* In February 2011, Alhurra&#x27;s Cairo bureau was targeted during the unrest in Egypt. Unknown armed men stormed its offices and &quot;threatened to kill Al-Hurra&#x27;s two on-air journalists—Akram Khuzam and Tarek El Shamy—if they didn&#x27;t leave the building.&quot;
* Beginning 2 February 2011, Alhurra&#x27;s satellite signal was jammed for nearly a month by Libyan authorities in response to coverage of anti-government protests in the country.
* In October 2010, Tahrir Kadhim Jawad, a freelance journalist and contributor to Alhurra, was killed when a bomb attached to his car exploded in Garma, Iraq, west of Baghdad in Al Anbar Governorate.
* In May 2010, Mauritanian police beat several journalists and briefly detained Hachem Sidi Salem, a local correspondent for the satellite television channel Alhurra, for covering a strike by members of the National Bar Association.
* In October 2008, Alhurra TV correspondent Saad Qusay was forced to request around-the-clock police protection at his home in Basra after being threatened by a militant group. The authorities subsequently advised Qusay to leave the country temporarily as an additional safety measure.
* In April 2008, Iraqi cameraman Mazin al-Tayar was shot in the leg as he filmed a military operation in Hayaniyah for Alhurra.
* In December 2006, Unidentified gunmen shot and wounded Omar Mohammad, an Alhurra correspondent, in Baghdad&#x27;s central Bab al-Sharqi area.
* In February 2005, Iraqi Alhurra correspondent Abdul-Hussein Khazal and his three-year-old son were shot dead by unknown gunmen in Basra.

==Historical controversies==

=== Allegations of pro-American bias ===
The fact that Alhurra is funded by the U.S. Congress through the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), formerly the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), has led some critics to claim that the channel is &quot;state propaganda&quot; and presents its news with a pro-American bias. Alhurra has openly tried to distinguish itself from the perceived anti-American tone of its competition. Executives in the channel&#x27;s early days instructed broadcasters to avoid the use of &quot;loaded&quot; terms (such as &quot;martyr,&quot; &quot;resistance fighters,&quot; or &quot;occupation forces&quot;) used frequently on networks such as al-Jazeera in reporting about the U.S. military operation in Iraq, opting for terms like &quot;armed groups&quot; and &quot;U.S. and coalition forces.&quot;

Alhurra is observed by Arab journalists as complying too scrupulously with embargoes on military information when Western media outlets frequently disregard these same requests. Steve Tatham, a British Royal Navy officer, recorded an instance in which a British officer briefed Arab and Western media that a humanitarian aid ship was being held back pending operations against Iraqi insurgents in the area. According to Tatham&#x27;s account, when the officer asked the media to delay reporting this information for security reasons, Fox News disregarded the request whereas Alhurra complied.

Mouafac Harb, Alhurra&#x27;s first news director who resigned from the organization in 2006, claimed that he left in part because he &quot;sensed the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), formally the Broadcasting Board of Governors wanted Alhurra to promote U.S. foreign policy instead of just reporting the news.&quot; Harb claimed that at Alhurra there had been a &quot;tendency to please Washington and not the [Arab] audience.&quot;

=== Allegations of anti-American bias ===
Alhurra has also faced criticism from American conservative pundits who claimed that the organization had been broadcasting &quot;anti-American&quot; content. In 2007, conservative columnist Joel Mowbray wrote a series of harshly critical op-eds in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, claiming that Alhurra had become a &quot;platform for terrorists.&quot; Mowbray noted that Alhurra had broadcast live, unedited speeches by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, an interview with an alleged al-Qaeda operative who expressed joy at the 9/11 attacks, and a panel whose members offered conspiracy theories about alleged Israeli plans to destroy the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.

Mowbray also cited unnamed Alhurra staffers who accused news director Larry Register of &quot;trying to pander to Arab sympathies&quot; to make the channel more like Al Jazeera. Register – a veteran CNN producer who had been appointed as Mouafac Harb&#x27;s successor with a charge to overhaul the channel&#x27;s operations and increase viewership – was forced to resign as a result of the public uproar created by Mowbray&#x27;s articles.

A 2008 U.S. Inspector General&#x27;s office report noted that Alhurra has taken significant steps to tighten its procedures and policies in order to protect the credibility that is critical to fulfilling its mission.

=== Criticism of administration and oversight ===
A critical &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and ProPublica report in 2008 stated that &quot;there appeared to be little oversight of the daily operations&quot; of Alhurra. The report criticized Alhurra&#x27;s top executives and directors for either lacking Arabic-language proficiency or possessing a media background to ensure that the broadcasts met basic journalistic standards.

A 2010 report from the U.S. Inspector General&#x27;s office noted that inspectors &quot;heard consistent reports of poor communication in the news operation.&quot; The inspector&#x27;s main criticism was of the channel&#x27;s news director Daniel Nassif, who was highlighted in reports of &quot;newsroom management issues that were reported to the inspectors to have arisen during his tenure or remain unsettled from an earlier time.&quot; The hiring of several employee&#x27;s relatives also led to accusations of nepotism. However, the same report also determined that MBN exercised tighter editorial controls over its programming and maintained the editorial principles for balance and comprehensiveness found in the International Broadcasting Act of 1994.

<doc id="471675" wikidata="Q3312622" url="?curid=471675" title="Thermal-transfer printing">
<text>Thermal-transfer printing is a digital printing method in which material is applied to paper (or some other material) by melting a coating of ribbon so that it stays glued to the material on which the print is applied. It contrasts with direct thermal printing, where no ribbon is present in the process.

Thermal transfer is preferred over direct thermal printing on surfaces that are heat-sensitive or when higher durability of printed matter (especially against heat) is desired. Thermal transfer is a popular print process particularly used for the printing of identification labels. It is the most widely used printing process in the world for the printing of high-quality barcodes. Printers like label makers can laminate the print for added durability.

Thermal transfer printing was invented by SATO corporation. The world&#x27;s first thermal-transfer label printer SATO M-2311 was produced in 1981.

== Thermal-transfer printing process ==
Thermal-transfer printing is done by melting wax within the print heads of a specialized printer. The thermal-transfer print process utilises three main components: a non-movable print head, a carbon ribbon (the ink) and a substrate to be printed, which would typically be paper, synthetics, card or textile materials. These three components effectively form a sandwich with the ribbon in the middle. A thermally compliant print head, in combination with the electrical properties of the ribbon and the correct rheological properties of the ribbon ink are all essential in producing a high-quality printed image.

Print heads are available in 203 dpi, 300 dpi and 600 dpi resolution options. Each dot is addressed independently, and when a dot is electronically addressed, it immediately heats up to a pre-set (adjustable) temperature. The heated element immediately melts the wax- or resin-based ink on the side of the ribbon film facing the substrate, and this process, in combination with the constant pressure being applied by the print-head locking mechanism immediately transfers it onto the substrate. When a dot &quot;turns off&quot;, that element of the print head immediately cools down, and that part of the ribbon thereby stops melting/printing. As the substrate comes out of the printer, it is completely dry and can be used immediately.

Carbon ribbons are on rolls and are fitted onto a spindle or reel holder within the printer. The used ribbon is rewound by a take-up spindle, forming a roll of &quot;used&quot; ribbon. It is termed a &quot;one-trip&quot; ribbon because once it has been rewound, the used roll is discarded and replaced with a new one. If one were to hold a strip of used carbon ribbon up to the light, one would see an exact negative of the images that have been printed. The main benefit of using a one-trip thermal transfer ribbon is that providing the correct settings are applied prior to printing, a 100% density of printed image is guaranteed, in contrast to a pre-inked ribbon on a dot-matrix impact printer ribbon, which gradually fades with usage.

== Variants ==

=== Color thermal printers ===

Thermal-printing technology can be used to produce color images by adhering a wax-based ink onto paper. As the paper and ribbon travel in unison beneath the thermal print head, the wax-based ink from the transfer ribbon melts onto the paper. When cooled, the wax is permanently adhered to the paper. This type of thermal printer uses a like-sized panel of ribbon for each page to be printed, regardless of the contents of the page. Monochrome printers have a black panel for each page to be printed, while color printers have either three (CMY) or four (CMYK) colored panels for each page. Unlike dye-sublimation printers, these printers cannot vary the dot intensity, which means that images must be dithered. Although acceptable in quality, the printouts from these printers cannot compare with modern inkjet printers and color laser printers. Currently, this type of printer is rarely used for full-page printing, but is now employed for industrial label printing due to its waterfastness and speed. These printers are considered highly reliable due to their small number of moving parts. Printouts from color thermal printers using wax are sensitive to abrasion, as the wax ink can be scraped, rubbed off, or smeared. However, wax-resin compounds and full resins can be used on materials such as polypropylene or polyester in order to increase durability.

=== Tektronix/Xerox solid-ink printers ===

So-called &quot;solid ink&quot; or &quot;phaser&quot; printers were developed by Tektronix and later by Xerox (who acquired Tektronix&#x27;s printer division). Printers like the Xerox Phaser 8400 use rectangular solid-state ink blocks (similar in consistency to candle wax), which are loaded into a system similar to a stapler magazine in the top of the printer. The ink blocks are melted, and the ink is transferred onto a rotating oil-coated print drum using a piezo inkjet head. The paper then passes over the print drum, at which time the image is transferred, or transfixed, to the page. This system is similar to water-based inkjets, provided that the ink has low viscosity at the jetting temperature 60 °C (140 °F). Printout properties are similar to those mentioned above, although these printers can be configured to produce extremely high-quality results and are far more economical, as they only use the ink needed for the printout, rather than an entire ribbon panel. Costs of upkeep and ink are comparable to color laser printers, while &quot;standby&quot; power usage can be very high, about 200 W.

=== ALPS MicroDry printers ===
MicroDry is a computer printing system developed by the Alps Electric of Japan. It is a wax/resin-transfer system using individual colored thermal ribbon cartridges and can print in process color using cyan, magenta, yellow, and black cartridges, as well as such spot-color cartridges as white, metallic silver, and metallic gold, on a wide variety of paper and transparency stock. Certain MicroDry printers can also operate in dye-sublimation mode, using special cartridges and paper.

== Uses ==

Usage of TT printers in industry includes:
* Barcode labels (as labels printed with a thermal printer tend not to last long) and marking of clothing labels (shirt size etc.).
* Label printers with plastic, paper, and metal label materials.

Barcode printers typically come in fixed sizes of wide. Although a number of manufacturers have made differing sizes in the past, most have now standardised on these sizes. The main application of these printers is to produce barcode labels for product and shipping identification.

<doc id="471679" wikidata="Q6932537" url="?curid=471679" title="Muhammad Ismail Agha">
<text>Muhammad Ismail Agha (born 1988 or 1989) is an Afghan national who was among some 15-21 juveniles held at the Guantanamo Bay detention camps. He is believed to be 13 or 14 years old when arrested by Afghan soldiers. Detained without charge, he was released on January 29, 2004, and returned home.

He was recaptured in May 2004 during an engagement with US forces near Kandahar.

==Early life==

Agha was born in Durabin (also written as Doorbini), a poor farming village near Nawzad, Afghanistan. There is some confusion about his date of birth: U.S. Department of Defense records indicate he was born in 1988, while first-hand reports suggest it was 1989.[a]

He helped his father, Hayatullah, as a builder, before leaving his village to look for construction work in December 2002.

==Detention in 2002==
Shortly after leaving home to look for work in December 2002, Agha was detained by Afghan soldiers in Girishk for attempting to join the Taliban to fight against Americans, a charge he denied. At the time, he would have been aged between 13 and 14 years old.[b] He was then transferred to the United States at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. During this time, he says he was held in solitary confinement and subjected to sleep deprivation and stress position, both enhanced interrogation techniques used at the time by the U.S. Armed Forces.

He was then transferred on February 7, 2003, to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.[c] He was put with two other teenagers, Naqibullah and Asadullah, in Camp Iguana, the section of Guantanamo built for juveniles. Unlike other detainees, those in Camp Iguana were not shackled and hooded, and did not wear orange boiler suits.

They were given classes in Pashto (their native language), English, Arabic, Islam, mathematics, science, and art. While there, they learned to read and write. Their camp had a recreation yard, where the boys played football every day with their guards, and sometimes basketball and volleyball. Agha and his family said that he was treated well by the American troops and attended school during his incarceration at Guantanamo, although he criticized the US for not contacting his parents for 10 months, and failing to let them know that he was still alive during that time.

He was transported to Bagram along with the other two juvenile detainees and released on January 29, 2004; a Red Cross plane took him from there to Kandahar.

==Subsequent recapture==
Agha was recaptured in May 2004, while participating in an attack on US forces near Kandahar, and was carrying documentation linking him to the Taliban. In June 2005, Representative Duncan Hunter, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said that the Guantanamo release policy was too liberal, pointing to the capture of Agha four months after his release. This was repeated by Senator Lindsey Graham in the U.S. Senate a year later, adding that the attack occurred near Kandahar. The US military released a list confirming his recapture in May 2007.

He was a six-time NHL All-Star and, in 2003, was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.

In 2017, Fuhr was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history. He set a number of firsts for black ice hockey players in the NHL, including being the first to win the Stanley Cup and being the first inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Fuhr was born to one Afro-Canadian parent and one First Nation-Canadian parent from the Enoch Cree Nation; he was adopted by parents Betty Wheeler and Robert Fuhr and raised in Spruce Grove, Alberta.

In the mid-1970s, Fuhr played for the Enoch Tomahawks hockey team. Fuhr&#x27;s mother came from Enoch Cree Nation.

In 1979, at the age of 17, Fuhr joined the Victoria Cougars of the Western Hockey League (WHL). After two outstanding seasons in Victoria, which included the league championship and a trip to the Memorial Cup in 1981, Fuhr was drafted eighth overall by the Edmonton Oilers in the 1981 NHL Entry Draft, on June 10, 1981.

==Playing career==
===Edmonton Oilers (1981–1991)===
Fuhr played ten seasons for the Oilers, where he teamed up first with Andy Moog from 1981 through 1987, then Bill Ranford from 1988 through 1991 to form one of the most formidable goaltending tandems in history, winning the Stanley Cup four times in five seasons (1983–84 through 1987–88). Moog was given the starting job in the 1983 playoffs and helped lead the Oilers to their first Stanley Cup Finals, though they were swept by the New York Islanders, who captured their fourth straight Stanley Cup. The next year general manager and head coach Glen Sather chose to go with Fuhr in the 1984 playoffs. However, Fuhr was injured in the third game of the Stanley Cup Finals in a rematch against the Islanders when he collided with Pat LaFontaine, so Moog stepped in and led the Oilers to a series win. After that, Fuhr remained the number one goaltender. Fuhr was also involved with the infamous goal where Steve Smith scored on his net to cost the Oilers the &#x27;86 playoffs against the Calgary Flames. Fuhr was the team&#x27;s starting goaltender on the first four teams but was injured and did not play in the 1990 playoffs when the Oilers won for the fifth time.

In 1987, Fuhr played in goal for the NHL All-Stars in both games of the Rendez-Vous &#x27;87 series against the Soviet National Team. In 1987-88, Fuhr backstopped Canada to a victory at the Canada Cup, playing in all nine games, then played in 75 regular season and 19 playoff games. He won his only Vezina Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top goaltender that year. He finished second in voting for the Hart Memorial Trophy as league MVP, behind Mario Lemieux and ahead of teammate Wayne Gretzky. He also played in the National Hockey League All-Star Game in 1984, 1985, 1986, 1988, and 1989. Fuhr&#x27;s playoff success fed into his reputation as the supreme clutch goaltender of his era, and there was a period from 1987 through at least 1989 where Fuhr was often called &quot;the best goaltender in the world&quot;. On January 28, 1989, Fuhr attained his 200th career win with a 7 - 6 road win over the Los Angeles Kings at the Great Western Forum.

Fuhr was suspended by the NHL for 59 games of the 1990–91 season. Fuhr had come forward about his drug use after spending two weeks in a counseling centre in Florida. He admitted that he used &quot;a substance&quot; (not specifying whether or not it was cocaine) for some seven years, or most of the period that the Oilers rested at the top of the NHL. Details of Fuhr&#x27;s drug use were supplied by his ex-wife, Corrine, who told the press in Edmonton that she often found cocaine hidden in his clothing and that she fielded numerous threatening telephone calls from drug dealers who had not been paid. These embarrassing details no doubt contributed to the one-year suspension handed down in September 1990 by NHL president John Ziegler, who called Fuhr&#x27;s conduct &quot;dishonorable and against the welfare of the league.&quot; After missing 59 games and entering a two-week rehab program, the suspension was lifted by the league on February 18, 1991. Once Fuhr was re-instated, fans of opposing teams taunted him at games with bags of sugar. 

===Post-Oilers career (1991–2000)===
On September 19, 1991, Fuhr was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in a seven-player deal. After a season and a half in Toronto, he was again traded, this time to the Buffalo Sabres, on February 2, 1993.

In Buffalo, he played a role in the Sabres&#x27; dramatic first-round playoff victory over the Boston Bruins, helped instill a winning attitude in the organization, and mentored a still relatively inexperienced Dominik Hašek. Fuhr then had a successful 1993–94 season with the Sabres, initially sharing goaltending duties with Hašek. Hašek became the Sabres&#x27; full-time starting goaltender after Fuhr suffered multiple injuries. Fuhr and Hašek were awarded the William M. Jennings Trophy for the fewest goals allowed.

In May 1993, while a member of the Sabres, Fuhr was denied membership in the neighbouring Transit Valley Country Club. At the time, rumours floated that the denial was based on race, as several of Fuhr&#x27;s white teammates had been granted membership. Club officials denied they rejected Fuhr based on his race; rather, his application contained &quot;incorrect and incomplete&quot; information. Various acts of vandalism at the club occurred after news of Fuhr&#x27;s rejection surfaced, including an incident where vandals burned a swastika onto one of the greens. In light of the negative publicity, the club reversed its position and offered Fuhr not only membership but an apology as well. Fuhr rejected the membership and joined the nearby Lancaster Country Club. The club also temporarily suspended its membership committee and had an anti-bias policy written into its by-laws.

With Hašek now ensconced in the Sabres&#x27; net, Fuhr was dealt to the Los Angeles Kings, on February 14, 1995, reuniting him with Gretzky.

Although he began the season out of shape and was considered to be past his prime, his career saw a resurgence when he signed as a free agent with the St. Louis Blues on July 14, before the 1995–96 season. He played 79 games that season, 76 consecutively, both NHL records. On November 30, 1995, Fuhr earned his 300th career win versus the Winnipeg Jets with a 4 - 1 road win at the Winnipeg Arena in Winnipeg. Fuhr and Gretzky became teammates for the third time when the Blues acquired Gretzky in a trade with the Kings on February 27, 1996. The 1996 playoff run for Fuhr ended prematurely as Maple Leafs forward Nick Kypreos ran into him in the crease in the first round, causing him to tear several knee ligaments. Jon Casey had to play the rest of the playoffs. The Blues beat Toronto in the first round but lost to Detroit in the next. Even though over the next three years he became one of the three winningest goaltenders in Blues history (along with Mike Liut and Curtis Joseph), Fuhr never fully recovered from his injury. After the Blues signed Roman Turek as their new number-one goaltender in 1999, Fuhr was traded to the Calgary Flames on September 5, 1999. He spent one season there being a mentor for Calgary&#x27;s young goaltenders, including Fred Brathwaite, and on October 22, 1999, he earned his 400th career win against the Florida Panthers with a 3 - 2 road win in overtime. On April 5, 2000, following a 6–5 loss to St. Louis, which statistically eliminated the Flames from playoff contention that postseason, Fuhr announced that he would retire after the 1999–2000 season.

==International play==
Fuhr was named to the 1984 Canada Cup team but saw limited action during the tournament due to an injury. Fuhr was again selected to represent Canada in the 1987 Canada Cup. It was here that he cemented his reputation as one of the best goaltenders in the game. Playing against a tough Soviet Union squad, Fuhr turned away shot after shot during the three-game final. After the Edmonton Oilers were eliminated by the Los Angeles Kings in the 1st round of the 1989 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Grant also played for Team Canada at the 1989 World Championships where he won a silver medal.

==Post-playing career==
Fuhr was hired to be the Phoenix Coyotes goaltending coach on July 22, 2004. Fuhr held the position until the end of the 2008-09 season when he was replaced by Sean Burke. He held a similar post with the Calgary Flames in the 2000–2001 and 2001–2002 seasons.

In 2015, Fuhr collaborated on his biography with Bruce Dowbiggin, &quot;Grant Fuhr: The Story of a Hockey Legend&quot;.

In 2022, Fuhr began doing radio and television broadcasting for the Coachella Valley Firebirds, the American Hockey League affiliate of the Seattle Kraken, and joined the 3ICE 3-on-3 professional ice hockey summer league as a coach.

==Personal life==
Fuhr married Lisa Cavanaugh in the Cayman Islands on September 14, 2014. He has four children from previous marriages and a step-daughter.

Fuhr was a regular competitor at the American Century Championship, an annual competition to determine the best golfers among American sports and entertainment celebrities. The tournament is played at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course along the edge of Lake Tahoe.

<doc id="471681" wikidata="Q41135" url="?curid=471681" title="Ming tombs">
<text>The Ming tombs are a collection of mausoleums built by the emperors of the Ming dynasty of China. The first Ming emperor&#x27;s tomb is located near his capital Nanjing. However, the majority of the Ming tombs are located in a cluster near Beijing and collectively known as the Thirteen Tombs of the Ming dynasty (). They are located within the suburban Changping District of Beijing Municipality, north-northwest of Beijing&#x27;s city center. The site, on the southern slope of Tianshou Mountain (originally Huangtu Mountain), was chosen based on the principles of &quot;feng shui&quot; by the third Ming emperor, the Yongle Emperor. After the construction of the Imperial Palace (Forbidden City) in 1420, the Yongle Emperor selected his burial site and created his own mausoleum. The subsequent emperors placed their tombs in the same valley.

From the Yongle Emperor onwards, thirteen Ming emperors were buried in the same area. The Xiaoling Mausoleum of the first Ming emperor, the Hongwu Emperor, is located near his capital Nanjing; the second emperor, the Jianwen Emperor, was overthrown by the Yongle Emperor and disappeared, without a known tomb. The &quot;temporary&quot; emperor, the Jingtai Emperor, was also not buried here, as the Tianshun Emperor had denied him an imperial burial; instead, the Jingtai Emperor was buried west of Beijing. The last emperor buried at the location was Chongzhen, the last of his dynasty, who committed suicide by hanging on April 25, 1644. He was buried in his concubine Consort Tian&#x27;s tomb, which was later declared as an imperial mausoleum &quot;Siling&quot; by the emperor of the short-lived Shun dynasty, Li Zicheng, with a much smaller scale compared to the other imperial mausoleums built for Ming emperors.

During the Ming dynasty, the tombs were off limits to commoners, but in 1644 Li Zicheng&#x27;s army ransacked and burned many of the tombs before advancing to and subsequently capturing Beijing in April of that year.

In 1725, the Yongzheng Emperor bestowed the hereditary title of marquis on a descendant of the Ming imperial family, Zhu Zhilian, who received a salary from the Qing government and whose duty was to perform rituals at the Ming tombs. He was posthumously promoted to Marquis of Extended Grace in 1750 by the Qianlong Emperor, and the title passed on through twelve generations of Ming descendants until the end of the Qing dynasty.

Presently, the Ming tombs are designated as one of the components of the World Heritage Site, the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, which also includes a number of other locations near Beijing and in Nanjing, Hebei, Hubei, Liaoning province.

==Layout==


The siting of the Ming dynasty imperial tombs was carefully chosen according to Feng Shui (geomancy) principles. According to these, bad spirits and evil winds descending from the North must be deflected; therefore, an arc-shaped valley area at the foot of the Jundu Mountains, north of Beijing, was selected. This area—enclosed by the mountains in a pristine, quiet valley full of dark earth, tranquil water and other necessities as per Feng Shui—would become the necropolis of the Ming dynasty.

A road named the &quot;Spirit Way&quot; () leads into the complex, lined with statues of guardian animals and officials, with a front gate consisting of a three-arches, painted red, and called the &quot;Great Red Gate&quot;. The Spirit Way, or Sacred Way, starts with a huge stone memorial archway lying at the front of the area. Constructed in 1540, during the Ming dynasty, this archway is one of the biggest stone archways in China today.

Further in, the Shengong Shengde Stele Pavilion can be seen; inside, there is a 50-ton stone statue of a Bixi carrying a memorial tablet. Four white marble &quot;Huabiao&quot; (pillars of glory) are positioned at each corner of the stele pavilion. At the top of each pillar is a mythical beast. Each side of the road is flanked by two pillars whose surfaces are carved with the cloud design, and tops are shaped like a rounded cylinder. They are of a traditional design, and were originally beacons to guide the soul of the deceased, The road leads to 18 pairs of stone statues of mythical animals, which are all sculpted from whole stones and larger than life size, leading to a three-arched gate known as the Dragon and Phoenix Gate.
At present, only three tombs are open to the public:
* Changling, the largest (); 
* Dingling, whose underground palace has been excavated (); and 
* Zhaoling.

There have been no excavations since 1989, but plans for new archeological research and further opening of tombs have circulated. 

The Ming tombs were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in August 2003. They were listed along with other tombs under the &quot;Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties&quot; designation.
==List of the Imperial Tombs==
The imperial tombs are in chronological order and list the individuals buried:
The Ming emperors not buried in one of the Thirteen Tombs are: Hongwu Emperor, Zhu Biao, Emperor Kang, Jianwen Emperor, Jingtai Emperor, and Zhu Youyuan, Emperor Xian.

<text>Hell Gate is a narrow tidal strait in the East River in New York City. It separates Astoria, Queens, from Randall&#x27;s and Wards Islands in Manhattan.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Hell Gate&quot; is a corruption of the Low German or Dutch phrase &quot;Hellegat which means “bright gate”. It&quot; first appeared on a Dutch map as &quot;Helle Gadt&quot;. The name was originally applied to the entirety of the East River, by Dutch explorer Adriaen Block, the first European known to have navigated the strait, who bestowed the name sometime during his 1614–1616 voyage aboard the &quot;Onrust&quot; circumnavigating Long Island, from its namesake Hellegat on (the mouth of) the Scheldt, in Zeeland back in the Netherlands.

This name Hellegat was taken from the Greek Hellespont (Dardanelles) which also has a dangerous reputation, in the opinion of historian Edward Manning Ruttenber. Alternatively, the name could be construed to mean &quot;bright strait&quot; or &quot;clear opening&quot;, according to geographer Henry Gannett.

Because explorers found navigation hazardous in this New World place of rocks and converging tide-driven currents (from the Long Island Sound, Harlem River strait, Upper Bay of New York Harbor, and lesser channels, some of which have been filled), the Anglicization stuck.

The strait was also known as Hurl Gate (or Hurlgate), and so labeled on 18th and 19th century maps and annals, this name probably consisting of Dutch &#x27; &quot;whirl&quot; and &#x27; &quot;hole, gap, mouth&quot;, in effect denoting &quot;whirlpool&quot;.

For the whirlpool that develops in Hell Gate, the name Monatun was applied by Dr. Henry Rowe Schoolcraft; the name is said to mean &quot;violent, forcible, dangerous&quot;.

==History==
In October 1776, Admiral Howe sailed some of the British fleet through the strait, an action which was considered reckless at the time.

Hell Gate was spanned in 1917 by the New York Connecting Railroad Bridge, now called the Hell Gate Bridge, which connects Wards Island and Queens. The bridge provides a direct rail link between New England and New York City. In 1936, it was spanned by the Triborough Bridge (now the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge), allowing vehicular traffic to pass among Manhattan, the Bronx, and Queens.

===Clearing rocks===

Periodically, merchants and other interested parties would try to get something done about the difficulty of navigating through Hell Gate. In 1832, the New York State legislature was presented with a petition for a canal to be built through nearby Hallet&#x27;s Point, thus avoiding Hell Gate altogether. Instead, the legislature responded by providing ships with pilots trained to navigate the shoals for the next 15 years.

In 1849, a French engineer whose specialty was underwater blasting, Benjamin Maillefert, had cleared some of the rocks which, along with the mix of tides, made the Hell Gate stretch of the river so dangerous to navigate. Ebenezer Meriam had organized a subscription to pay Maillefert $6,000 to, for instance, reduce &quot;Pot Rock&quot; to provide of depth at low-mean water. While ships continued to run aground (in the 1850s about 2% of ships did so) and petitions continued to call for action, the federal government undertook surveys of the area which ended in 1851 with a detailed and accurate map.

By then Maillefert had cleared the rock &quot;Baldheaded Billy&quot;, and it was reported that Pot Rock had been reduced to , which encouraged the United States Congress to appropriate $20,000 for further clearing of the strait. However, a more accurate survey showed that the depth of Pot Rock was actually a little more than , and eventually Congress withdrew its funding.

With the main shipping channels through The Narrows into the harbor silting up with sand due to littoral drift, thus providing ships with less depth, and a new generation of larger ships coming online – epitomized by Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s SS &quot;Great Eastern&quot;, popularly known as &quot;Leviathan&quot; – New York began to be concerned that it would start to lose its status as a great port if a &quot;back door&quot; entrance into the harbor was not created. In the 1850s the depth continued to lessen – the harbor commission said in 1850 that the mean water low was and the extreme water low was – while the draft required by the new ships continued to increase, meaning it was only safe for them to enter the harbor at high tide.

The U.S. Congress, realizing that the problem needed to be addressed, appropriated $20,000 for the Army Corps of Engineers to continue Maillefert&#x27;s work, but the money was soon spent without appreciable change in the hazards of navigating the strait. An advisory council recommended in 1856 that the strait be cleared of all obstacles, but nothing was done, and the Civil War soon broke out.

In the late 1860s, after the Civil War, Congress realized the military importance of having easily navigable waterways, and charged the Army Corps of Engineers with clearing Hell Gate of the rocks there that caused a danger to navigation. The Corps&#x27; Colonel James Newton estimated that the project would cost $1 million, as compared to the approximate annual loss in shipping of $2 million. Initial forays floundered, and Newton, by that time a general, took over direct control of the project. In 1868 Newton decided, with the support of both New York&#x27;s mercantile class and local real estate interests, to focus on the Hallert&#x27;s Point Reef off of Queens. The project would involve of tunnels equipped with trains to haul debris out as the reef was eviscerated, creating a reef structured like Swiss cheese, which Newton would then blow up.

After seven years of digging seven thousand holes, and filling four thousand of them with of dynamite, on September 24, 1876, in front of an audience of people including the inhabitants of the insane asylum on Wards Island, but not the prisoners of Blackwell&#x27;s Island (now known as Roosevelt Island) who remained in their cells, Newton&#x27;s daughter set off the explosion. The effect was immediate in decreased turbulence through the strait, and fewer accidents and shipwrecks. The city&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce commented that &quot;The Centennial year will be for ever known in the annals of commerce for this destruction of one of the terrors of navigation.&quot; Clearing out the debris from the explosion took until 1891.

Newton had begun to undermine Flood Rock, a reef, even before starting on Hallert&#x27;s Rock, removing of rock from the reef. In 1885 Flood Rock was blown up as well, with Civil War General Philip Sheridan and abolitionist Henry Ward Beecher among those in attendance. Newton&#x27;s daughter once more set off the blast, the biggest ever to that date and subsequently reported as the largest man-made explosion until the advent of the atomic bomb although the detonation at the Battle of Messines in 1917 was several times larger. Two years later, plans were in place to dredge Hell Gate to a consistent depth of .

==In popular culture==
===Film===
* &quot;Hell Gate: The Watery Grave&quot; (1977), is a 50-minute documentary film, narrated by Alexander Scourby, which covers many aspects of the waterway&#x27;s history, including the clearing of the channel, the building of Hell Gate Bridge, and the PS &quot;General Slocum&quot; steamship disaster.
* &quot;Under Hellgate Bridge&quot; (1999), directed by Michael Sergio, is a crime drama/thriller film, set in Queens, that features the bridge.
* &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; (2002), directed by Martin Scorsese; the main character, Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio), is sent to Hell Gate Orphanage as a child upon the death of his father

===Literature===
In James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s historical fiction novel &quot;The Water-Witch, or, The Skimmer of the Seas&quot; (first published in New York in 1830), Hell Gate serves as the scene for an exciting pursuit of the brigantine &quot;Water Witch&quot; by HMS &quot;Coquette&quot;. The &quot;Water Witch&quot; is captained by Thomas Tiller, an adventurous sailor with a romantic flair, and HMS &quot;Coquette&quot; by Captain Cornelius van Cuyler Ludlow, a principled young officer in the Royal Navy and a native of New York.

<doc id="471687" wikidata="Q7993720" url="?curid=471687" title="Whipped-cream charger">
<text>A whipped cream charger (colloquially called a whippet, nos or nang when used recreationally) is a steel cylinder or cartridge filled with nitrous oxide (N2O) that is used as a whipping agent in whipped cream. The narrow end of a charger has a foil covering that is broken to release the gas. This is usually done by a sharp pin inside the whipping siphon.

Nitrous oxide is a popular recreational drug, and whipped cream chargers are a convenient source of the gas.

== Description ==
The cylinders are about long by wide, with a volume of and capacity for most brands of of pressurized N2O. Their walls are about thick to withstand the pressure of the gas, and they are rounded at one end with a narrow tip at the other end. While refillable chargers were once available, all chargers are now non-refillable; the latter consist entirely of recyclable steel.

== Production ==

In Europe, where the production and use of whip cream chargers originated, there are presently three factories involved in its production. Their standard capacity is 7.8 grams of nitrous oxide.

== Application ==

Whipped cream chargers are intended for low-volume or occasional use, such as home kitchens, restaurants, and coffee shop applications. 

For very high volume commercial use, there are regulated tank systems for filling much larger containers and dispensing more whipped cream. These are desirable if the volume is more than a production level of ten litres per hour.

== Uses ==

=== Culinary ===
Nitrous oxide is used because it dissolves easily into the cream, and does not cause the cream to oxidize while it is in the can.
The cream must have a minimum fat content of 28% to produce whipped cream with a dispenser. The recipe for the cream to be whipped typically calls for heavy cream and sugar, along with any desired flavorings or colorings. In a sealed container, this cream is pressurized with nitrous oxide, which dissolves into the cream as per its lipophilicity.

When the cream dispenser&#x27;s valve is opened, the cream solution is expelled by the high pressure inside. The change in pressure causes some of the dissolved gas to return to bubbles, effectively fluffing up the cream. Nitrous oxide is bacteriostatic (it inhibits bacteria growth), so a charged cream dispenser can be kept in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.

=== Recreational drug ===

Because of their availability, chargers are usually the method of choice for users seeking to use nitrous oxide recreationally. Tanks of medical-grade nitrous oxide are difficult to obtain, and vehicle-grade nitrous oxide contains substances such as sulfur dioxide to prevent human consumption. Chargers are cheaply available in many stores and online.

To inhale from a charger, users either fill a balloon using a cracker, fill an empty whipped cream dispenser and inhale from it, or likewise use a dispenser to fill a balloon as the potentially rapid rush of gas from the spout of the dispenser may be too harsh. Inhaling directly from a cracker is particularly dangerous due to the risk of developing frostbite on the inside of the mouth or esophagus. The 8 gram nitrous oxide steel cylinder charger when discharged into an empty whipped cream dispenser creates a pressure of 30 pounds per square inch (200kPa) and delivers 3.24 litres of nitrous oxide gas.

=== Model rocketry ===

Whipped cream chargers are also used by model rocket enthusiasts for micro hybrid engines, where it acts as an oxidizer for solid fuels such as polyethylene or HTPB.

<text>The New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (NZSIS; ) is New Zealand&#x27;s primary national intelligence agency. It is responsible for providing information and advising on matters including national security (including counterterrorism and counterintelligence) and foreign intelligence. It is headquartered in Wellington and overseen by a Director-General, the Minister of New Zealand Security Intelligence Service, and the parliamentary intelligence and security committee; independent oversight is provided by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.

SIS was established on 28 November 1956 with the primary function of combating perceived increases in Soviet intelligence operations in Australia and New Zealand. Since then, its legislated powers have expanded to increase its monitoring capabilities and include entry into private property. Its role has also expanded to include countering domestic and international terrorism, chemical, biological, and cyber threats.

The organisation has been criticised for its role in numerous high-profile incidents such as the 1974 arrest of Bill Sutch on charges of spying for the Soviet Union, the 1981 assassination attempt by Christopher Lewis on Queen Elizabeth II, and the 1996 invasion of GATT Watchdog organiser Aziz Choudry&#x27;s home. It has also been criticised for its failures to anticipate or prevent incidents such as the 1985 bombing of the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;, the 2004 purchasing of New Zealand passports by Israeli &quot;intelligence contract assets&quot;, and the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings by an Australian alt-right white supremacist terrorist.

==History==
===Origins and predecessors===
In the first half of the 20th century, domestic intelligence and counter-subversion were primarily in the hands of the New Zealand Police Force (1919–1941; 1945–1949) and the New Zealand Police Force Special Branch (1949–1956). During the Second World War, the short-lived New Zealand Security Intelligence Bureau (SIB) took over. The SIB was modeled after the British MI5 and was headed by Major Kenneth Folkes, a junior MI5 officer. However, the conman Syd Ross duped Major Folkes into believing that there was a Nazi plot in New Zealand. After this embarrassment, Prime Minister Peter Fraser dismissed Folkes in February 1943 and the SIB merged into the New Zealand Police. Following the end of the war in 1945, the police force resumed responsibility for domestic intelligence.

On 28 November 1956, the First National Government established the New Zealand Security Service (NZSS). Its goal was to counter increased Soviet intelligence operations in Australia and New Zealand in the wake of the Petrov Affair of 1954, which had damaged Soviet-Australian relations. The NZSS was again modeled on the British domestic intelligence agency MI5 and its first Director of Security, Brigadier William Gilbert, was a former New Zealand Army officer. Its existence remained a state secret until 1960.

===Formalisation and expansion of mandate===
The NZ Intelligence Community (NZIC) developed further in the late 1950s due to growing concerns about political terrorism, improvements in weaponry, news media coverage, and frequent air travel. As terrorist threats grew, along with potential connections to wider groups, the adoption of counter-insurgency techniques increased in New Zealand. In response to this, the New Zealand Parliament enacted the 1961 Crimes Act to allow improved targeting of possible terrorist suspects and scenarios. In 1969 the NZSS was formally renamed the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service. That same year Parliament passed the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service Act to cover the agency&#x27;s functions and responsibilities.

Various amendments were later made to the Security Intelligence Act, including the controversial 1977 amendment under Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, which expanded the SIS&#x27;s powers of monitoring considerably. The 1977 Amendment Act defined terrorism as: &quot;planning, threatening, using or attempting to use violence to coerce, deter, or intimidate&quot;. The Immigration Amendment Act of 1978 further expanded the definition of terrorism.

In 1987, Gerald Hensley, Chair of the NZIC, stated that the State Services Commission became attracted to the concept of &quot;comprehensive security&quot;, taking into account not only human-made threats such as terrorism but also natural hazards. This was also a response to the severing of intelligence-sharing arrangements New Zealand had with the United States in 1985 over nuclear policy. Following the attempted hijacking of an Air New Zealand flight and the bombing of the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; in 1985, Parliament enacted the International Terrorism (Emergency Powers) Act 1987. The Act gave censorship powers to the government around matters of national security and terrorism. This was a significant departure from New Zealand&#x27;s previous conformance to international norms and laws.

At the end of the 20th Century and beginning of the 21st, the NZIC adapted to emerging chemical, biological, and eventually cyber threats. These three areas became a key point of integration between the intelligence community agencies. Cases of terrorism overseas promoted the NZ Intelligence Community to regularly exchange information and meet the growing demands of addressing non-state actors.

==Purpose==
The SIS is a civilian intelligence and security organisation. Its stated roles are:
*To investigate threats to security and to work with other agencies within Government, so that the intelligence it collects is appropriately used and threats which have been identified are disrupted
*To collect foreign intelligence
*To provide a range of protective security advice and services to Government.

As a civilian organisation, the SIS&#x27;s remit does not include enforcement (although it has limited powers to intercept communications and search residences). Its role is intended to be advisory, providing the government with information on threats to national security or national interests. It also advises other government agencies about their own internal security measures, and is responsible for performing checks on government employees who require security clearance. The SIS is responsible for most of the government&#x27;s counter-intelligence work.

In 2007, it was reported that the SIS wished to expand its role into fighting organized crime.

==Organisation==
The SIS is based in Wellington, with branches in Auckland and Christchurch. It has close to 300 full-time staff.

The Director-General of the SIS reports to the minister of New Zealand Security Intelligence Service. Independent oversight of its activities is provided by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.

==Directors==

The SIS is administered by a Director-General. , it has had eight directors generals:
*Brigadier Sir William Gilbert KBE DSO (1956–1976)
*Judge Paul Molineaux CMG (1976–1983)
*Brigadier Lindsay Smith CMG CBE (1983–1991)
*Lieutenant General Don McIver CMG OBE (1991–1999)
*Richard Woods (1999–2006)
*Warren Tucker (2006–2014)
*Rebecca Kitteridge CVO (2014–2023)
*Andrew Hampton (2023–Present)

==Public profile==
The SIS has been involved in a number of public incidents and controversies:

===Bill Sutch affair===
In 1974, the SIS was the source of information that led to the arrest of Bill Sutch, an economist and former civil servant, on charges of spying for the Soviet Union. Sutch was acquitted and the SIS was criticised for having accused him, although it has also been alleged that the SIS was correct in its accusation. The SIS released most of its files on Sutch in 2008.

===1981 Springbok tour===
In 1981, the SIS was criticised for drawing up a list of 15 &quot;subversives&quot; who participated in protests against the 1981 Springbok Tour, a visit by South Africa&#x27;s apartheid rugby team. Characterising individual protesters as &quot;subversives&quot; was deemed by many to be a violation of the right to protest government decisions.

===1981 Briefcase leak===
Also in 1981, an SIS operative inadvertently left a briefcase, containing a copy of &quot;Penthouse&quot;, three cold meat pies, and notes of a dinner party hosted by a German diplomat, on a journalist&#x27;s fence in Wellington, where it was found by the son of another journalist, Fran O&#x27;Sullivan.

===1985 &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; bombing===
In 1985, the SIS failed to prevent the French operation in which DGSE operatives bombed the Greenpeace vessel &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;, killing a photographer.

===1980s Cold War embassies espionage operations===
In early June 2020, Radio New Zealand reported that the NZSIS had raided the Czechoslovakian embassy in Wellington in 1986 as part of a joint operation with the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) to steal Warsaw Pact codebooks in order to break into the encrypted communications of Soviet-aligned countries during the Cold War. This operation would have breached the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. This revelation came to light as a result of an RNZ podcast series called &quot;The Service&quot;, produced by Wellington writer and documentary maker John Daniell, whose mother and step-father had both worked for the NZSIS. Daniell said that his step-father was involved in the raid and had claimed it was a success. Daniell&#x27;s account was corroborated by Gerald Hensley, who served as the head of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department under the-then Prime Minister David Lange, and former NZSIS officer Kit Bennetts. In response, both former Prime Minister Helen Clark and Andrew Little, who is the Minister in charge of the NZSIS and Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), refused to confirm that they had authorised raids on embassies based in New Zealand. RNZ also reported that the SIS had spied upon Labour MP Richard Northey under the pretext of his support for racial equality and nuclear disarmament. At the time of the spying, Northey was chair of the Justice and Law Reform Select Committee, which was responsible for financial oversight of the SIS, and of legislation altering its powers.

===Surveillance of left-wing, peace, and Māori activists===
In 1996, two SIS agents broke into the home of Aziz Choudry. Choudry was an organiser with GATT Watchdog, which was holding a public forum and rally against an APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) Trade Ministers meeting hosted in Christchurch. The Court of Appeal ruled that the SIS had exceeded their legislated powers of interception. Parliament later amended the SIS Act to give the SIS powers of entry into private property.

In 2004, it was alleged that the SIS was spying on Māori individuals and organisations, including those associated with the new Māori Party, for political purposes under the codename &quot;Operation Leaf&quot;. A government inquiry led by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security later rejected these claims in April 2005. The prime minister, Helen Clark called the allegations &quot;baseless&quot;. &quot;The Sunday Star-Times&quot;, the original source of the story, printed a full apology and retraction.

In December 2008, it was discovered that a Christchurch resident, Rob Gilchrist, had been spying on peace organisations and individuals including Greenpeace, Iraq war protesters, animal rights and climate change campaigners. He confessed to the allegations after his partner, Rochelle Rees, found emails sent between him and Special Investigation Group (SIG) officers, having found the emails while fixing Gilchrist&#x27;s computer. Rochelle Rees was a Labour party activist as well as an animal rights campaigner. Gilchrist was said to have passed on information via an anonymous email address to SIG officers including Detective Peter Gilroy and Detective Senior Sergeant John Sjoberg. SIG is connected with SIS. Gilchrist had been paid up to $600 a week by police for spying on New Zealand citizens, reportedly for at least 10 years. Gilchrist also said he was offered money by Thomson Clark Investigations to spy on the Save Happy Valley Coalition, an environmental group. The incident implied members of New Zealand political parties were spied on by SIS and SIG.

===Ahmed Zaoui affair===
In 2002, the SIS issued a security risk certificate for Ahmed Zaoui, an Algerian asylum-seeker, and recommended his deportation. Zaoui was detained under a warrant of commitment. Inspector General Laurie Greig resigned in March 2004 after controversy over comments perceived as biased against Zaoui. The risk certificate was subsequently lifted, allowing Zaoui to remain.

===Access to records===
Until 2003 the SIS was reluctant to release information on potential people of interest either under the Privacy Act or the Official Information Act due to security concerns. In 2003 it adopted a new archives policy, enabling wider release of such information. Information must still be declassified, but would be released &quot;regardless of whether the information reflects unfavourably on [the SIS] or shows it in a good light.&quot; In 2017 the Privacy Act was amended to make the SIS subject to most of its principles.

===2004 Israel-NZ passport scandal===
In July 2004, the SIS was criticised for not knowing that Israeli &quot;intelligence contract assets&quot; had been in New Zealand fraudulently purchasing New Zealand passports. This came to light when the New Zealand Police discovered the fraud. The case became world news and an embarrassment for both the SIS and Mossad. Two of the Israelis involved (Uriel Kelman and Eli Cara who had been based in Australia) were deported to Israel, while two non-Israelis believed to be involved (American Ze&#x27;ev Barkan and New Zealander David Reznic) left New Zealand before they were caught.

===Surveillance of students===
In November 2009, the SIS was criticised for asking university staff to report their colleagues or students if they were behaving suspiciously. The SIS said it was part of an effort to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.

===2011 Investigation of alleged Mossad operation===
In July 2011, the SIS was involved in an investigation of Israeli backpackers who were in New Zealand at the time of the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, in which one of the Israelis was killed. The Israelis were alleged to have been Mossad agents attempting to infiltrate the New Zealand government&#x27;s computer databases and steal sensitive information. The investigation concluded that there was no evidence of a Mossad operation.

===1981 Attempted assassination of Queen Elizabeth II===
In March 2018, the SIS released a memo confirming that an assassination attempt was made on Queen Elizabeth II during her 1981 visit in Dunedin despite alleged efforts by the New Zealand Police to cover up the incident. The perpetrator was 17 year-old Dunedin teenager Christopher Lewis. Lewis electrocuted himself in prison in 1997 while awaiting trial for an unrelated murder.

===2019 Christchurch mosque shootings===
After the 15 March 2019 white supremacist terrorist attack on two mosques in Christchurch, the failure of the SIS and other NZ state agencies to pay adequate attention to the far right, and to detect the terrorist was strongly criticised. Green Party MP Marama Davidson and Tuhoe activist and artist Tame Iti, among others, suggested that the SIS and other state security and intelligence agencies had the wrong people under surveillance, including Muslim communities, Māori, and environmental activists. The spokesperson for the Islamic Women&#x27;s Council of New Zealand, Anjum Rahman, voiced frustration at the failure of the SIS to take Muslim community concerns about racist violence and the rise of the alt-right in New Zealand seriously.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that there would be an inquiry into the circumstances that led to the mosque attacks and what the relevant agencies (SIS, Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), police, Customs and Immigration) knew about the individual and the accused&#x27;s activities. The official Royal Commission into the attacks was made public on 8 December 2020, and found that intelligence agencies including the NZSIS and GCSB had placed excessive focus on Islamist terrorism, at the expense of detecting far-right and White supremacist threats.

On 22 March 2021, the NZSIS released an internal review known as the &quot;Arotake review&quot; exploring its decision-making process prior to the Christchurch mosque shootings. The review had been conducted by a counter-terrorism expert from the Five Eyes. In late March 2021, NZSIS Director-General Rebecca Kitteridge indicated that the NZSIS would be paying more attention to far right and white supremacist groups.

===2020 Zhenhua Data leak===
On 16 September 2020, the NZSIS confirmed that it was evaluating the &quot;potential risks and security concerns&quot; of the Chinese intelligence firm Zhenhua Data&#x27;s &quot;Overseas Key Individuals Database.&quot; The database had profiled 730 New Zealanders including Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern&#x27;s mother Laurell, father Ross, sister Louse, former Prime Minister John Key&#x27;s son Max, sportswoman Barbara Kendall, Māori leaders Dame Naida Glavish, former Minister of Finance Ruth Richardson, and Chief Censor David Shanks. Zhenhua&#x27;s database had been leaked to the American academic and China expert Professor Chris Balding, who passed the information to Australian cyber security firm Internet 2.0. The data leak was covered by several international media including the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot;, the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, the &quot;Indian Express&quot;, the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot;, and &quot;Il Foglio&quot;.

===2021 disclosure of counterintelligence operations===
In late March 2021, the NZSIS&#x27;s Director-General Rebecca Kitteridge confirmed that its agents had discovered a New Zealander who was gathering information for an unidentified foreign intelligence agency about individuals whom an unidentified foreign state regards as dissidents. University of Canterbury political scientist Anne-Marie Brady claimed that the spy had been working for China. In addition, the spy agency confirmed that, during the period between 2019 and 2020, it had disrupted the efforts of a person working for a foreign state to influence senior policy-makers, investigated the activities of individuals linked to several foreign states, and investigated foreign efforts to influence local and central government figures and New Zealand&#x27;s academic sector.

In late October 2021, Radio New Zealand reported that the NZSIS had designated a Chinese couple as a national security threat, prompting Immigration New Zealand to block the couple&#x27;s residency applications. The NZSIS asserted that the husband and wife had assisted Chinese intelligence services and deliberately concealed the amount of contact they had maintained with them. The couple had migrated to New Zealand in 2016 under the entrepreneur work visa scheme and established a business. The husband&#x27;s lawyer countered that the man had maintained legitimate contact with Chinese intelligence services while working at a private company in China because he had helped employees to obtain visas to enter China for business purposes.

===Spying on Nicky Hager===
In November 2022 the SIS paid journalist Nicky Hager $66,000 after unlawfully accessing his phone records. The spying was in response to Hager&#x27;s book &quot;Other People&#x27;s Wars&quot;, and attempted unsuccessfully to identify his sources. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security found that the SIS had no lawful power to investigate, and had not showed the kind of caution expected in a free and democratic society.

===Spying on Yuan Zhao===
In March 2023, Stuff reported that the NZSIS had questioned a Chinese New Zealander named Yuan Zhao in October 2022 on the suspicion that Yuan had used his position as a senior government analyst for the Public Service Commission (PSC) to spy for the Chinese Government and because of his &quot;close personal relationships&quot; with Chinese diplomats based in New Zealand. Zhao was subsequently suspended from his job at the Commission in late 2022. In March 2023, Zhao denied supplying the Chinese Government with information and claimed the NZSIS had no evidence to substantiate the information. In response, the NZSIS and PSC declined to comment on Zhao&#x27;s case, citing security protocols. Yuan subsequently complained to the intelligence agency&#x27;s watchdog, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Brendan Horsley, who confirmed his office was investigating Zhao&#x27;s complaint and would inform the public about the outcome. In response to media coverage, the Chinese Embassy issued a statement describing the espionage allegations against Zhao as &quot;ill-founded&quot; and motivated by an &quot;ulterior motive to smear and attack China, which we firmly oppose.&quot;

===Threat assessments===
On 11 August 2023, the NZSIS published its first unclassified threat assessment which identified violent extremism, foreign interference and espionage as three major threats to New Zealand. For the first time, the NZSIS identified China, Iran, and Russia as the foreign governments most responsible for foreign interference in New Zealand. According to the report, Chinese intelligence services were actively targeting ethnic Chinese communities in New Zealand while Russian was spreading disinformation among some New Zealanders through its international disinformation campaigns and seeking to acquire new technologies in order to circumvent international sanctions. The NZSIS also reported that Iranian state actors were monitoring and reporting on Iranian diaspora communities and dissident groups in New Zealand.

In early September 2024, the NZSIS published its second threat assessment. The report concluded that a small number of foreign states conducted interference and espionage operations targeting New Zealand and New Zealanders; that public and private sector insiders were vulnerable to espionage and unauthorised disclosure of information; that the risk of terror threats in New Zealand were low but that lone wolf attacks were the most likely scenarios; and that some individuals subscribed to violent extremist ideologies. The report noted that China uses professional social network websites such as LinkedIn for intelligence gathering. The threat assessment also found that violent extremists expoused various views including anti-Māori sentiment, anti-Semitism, hostility towards rainbow communities, Islamophobia and anti-immigrant sentiments. Following the report&#x27;s release, the Public Service Association express concerns that job cuts at the Department of Internal Affairs could hurt New Zealand&#x27;s response to online harm, foreign interference and digital espionage.

===Chinese recruitment of NZDF personnel===
In late March 2024, NZSIS Director-General Andrew Hampton confirmed that seven former New Zealand Defence personnel had been recruited by the Test Flying Academy of South Africa to train the People&#x27;s Liberation Army over the past 18 months. The former NZDF personnel had been supporting military and aviation training. These seven individuals had since left their roles at the Test Flying Academy.

<text>The Richard and Rhoda Goldman School of Public Policy, or the Goldman School of Public Policy (GSPP), is a public policy school and one of fourteen schools and colleges at the University of California, Berkeley. Originally named the Graduate School of Public Policy, it was founded in 1969 as one of the first public policy institutions in the United States. 

==History==
The Graduate School was renamed after the Richard and Rhoda Goldman Fund donated $10 million in 1997. As of August 2016, the dean is Henry E. Brady. The first dean was political scientist Aaron Wildavsky.

The building was originally designed by Ernest Coxhead in 1893 as the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house. It is located on the historic north side of the Berkeley campus. The building underwent seismic strengthening and received a Preservation Award from the Berkeley Architectural Heritage Association (BAHA).

The main component of the school&#x27;s graduate curriculum is the two-year Master of Public Policy (MPP) program. The curriculum includes core courses that provide a foundation in subjects ranging from political elements of the decision-making process and legal analysis to such specific analytic tools and concepts as microeconomic theory and statistical modeling. The curriculum also includes five electives, taken either at GSPP or elsewhere at Berkeley.

Students work at a summer policy internship between their first and second years and complete an analysis, in groups and individually, during the spring semester of each year. Locally- and nationally-known policy professionals, provide perspective and guidance to students.

GSPP offers a Master of Public Policy degree, a Master of Public Affairs degree for mid-career professionals,and Master of Development Practice (MDP) degree and a Ph.D. in Public Policy for those interested in furthering research in public policy methods. Though it does not award bachelor&#x27;s degrees, it offers a minor program for undergraduates.

<doc id="471696" wikidata="Q6708487" url="?curid=471696" title="Lynches River">
<text>Lynches River, named for Thomas Lynch, Jr., signer of the Declaration of Independence, rises in North Carolina near Waxhaw, North Carolina, at about elevation, flowing only a short distance to the South Carolina border, and thence to join the Great Pee Dee River near 
Johnsonville. It is about long and the drainage area is .

Several sections of the river have been designated by the state of South Carolina as a wild and scenic river, with the upper portions from Bishopville to the eastern boundary of Lynches River County Park receiving designation in 1994, and the lower 57 mile section designated in 2008. The river is a favorite for canoeing, but Hurricane Hugo in 1989 felled many trees, blocking the flow at places, making navigation difficult at low water and dangerous at high water. River enthusiasts have been gradually cleaning up the storm debris. The river is also a popular fishing spot, with sunfish, redbreast, catfish and bass.

==Geography==
===Upper Basin===
The upper reaches of the River are in the Piedmont, an area of worn down mountains, consisting mostly of metamorphic rocks, overlain by rocky clay soils. Much of the Piedmont is forested with some agricultural land, especially around Pageland, site of an annual watermelon festival.

This section of the river was an important gold, and minor iron mining area in the 19th century, with the first known gold being mined by placer in Lynches River and its tributaries near Pageland and Jefferson starting about 1828. Before the Civil War, 58 gold mines operated in South Carolina. All commercial mining ceased in 1942 when the federal government&#x27;s War Labor Board and PL-208 outlawed gold mining across the country. With the value of gold locked at $35 per ounce, and federal law prohibiting private citizens from holding gold between the 1930s and 1980s, nearly all gold mines in the United States became impractical and unprofitable to operate.

When the price of gold was released by the federal government, prices rose, and feasibility studies were begun on some of the old sites. At the Brewer gold mine, between Jefferson and Lynches River, it was deemed to have sufficient reserves to open it with modern machinery and technology. Between 1987 and 1991 the mine produced of gold, by crushing the ore and leaching it with a cyanide solution to dissolve the gold. In 1990 an accidental spill released cyanide into Lynches River and 11,000 fish died. The mine was closed for a few months for cleanup and repair.

===Middle Basin===
The river drops off the Piedmont between Bethune and McBee, cutting through the sand hills region, an old ocean shoreline with hills that are thought to be former beach dunes, now used for peach orchards and pine plantations. Near the river is the Carolina Sandhills National Wildlife Refuge and the Sandhills State Forest both in Chesterfield County.

At Bethune, South Carolina you&#x27;ll find the only bridge in the world that crosses the same river three times and the river does not fork. The Lynches River forms a large &#x27;S&quot; at the place where US Highway 1 crosses the river one mile north of Bethune.

===Lower Basin===
Below this the river valley widens and it begins to meander more, as it finishes its course through the coastal plain. As it passes Bishopville, South Carolina and Lynchburg, South Carolina, it flows through a traditional cotton farming belt. Bishopville is the site of the South Carolina Cotton Museum.

Lee State Park is located 4 miles southeast of Bishopville is a gateway to the Lynches River. Although river access is limited at the park, several boat ramps are located nearby. Fishing may be enjoyed from the park&#x27;s riverbanks. Children under 14 may fish in the Artesian Lake which has been stocked with catfish. There is a boardwalk out into the Lynches River floodplain that visitors can enjoy. At Coward, South Carolina, Florence County owns Lynches River County Park, which features nature trails, an elevated canopy walk, Splash Pad, geocaching, canoeing, and standards-based environmental education programs.

As the floodplain widens, the riversides become forested with tupelo, bald cypress, red maple, and other water loving vegetation. The uplands from Effingham to Johnsonville, South Carolina are also rich agricultural areas. Tobacco is the primary money crop for farmers, but cotton, corn, wheat, hay, and vegetables are also grown. Effingham is the site of McCall Farms, South Carolina&#x27;s only canning factory. At Johnsonville, the stream passes what was the largest factory along its length, that of Wellman Industries, a fiber processing and recycling plant. Just below Johnsonville, Lynches River empties into the Great Pee Dee River.

===Ecology===

Part of Lynches River has been designated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as critical habitat for the federally endangered Carolina heelsplitter, &quot;Lasmigona decorata&quot;, a freshwater mussel. The Carolina heelsplitter is a medium-sized freshwater mussel, reaching almost in length, with a greenish brown to dark brown shell. It is threatened by pollution and silting and only six small populations still are known to exist.

Another aquatic invertebrate that inhabits the Lynches River is a gastropod called, Ridged Lioplax, &quot;Lioplax subcarinata.&quot; South Carolina has designated it a Species of Concern. It has only been found in the Lynches and Waccamaw Rivers.

<doc id="471707" wikidata="Q11030131" url="?curid=471707" title="Proxy murder">
<text>A proxy murder is a murder that is committed indirectly, most likely by one person ordering another person, or through the use of a third party.

== Hit men ==
A common example of a proxy murder would be a person contracting a hit man, or a hired killer. Hit men commit the act of murder on a specific target or targets, and may receive payment in exchange for the murder or murders committed. This is what is known as contract killing. Hit men are most often associated with organized crime, e.g. mafias and street gangs.

== Honor killing ==

Honor killing is a type of murder when a person kills a member of his or her family for tarnishing the family image. Usually the victim is a woman who has violated sexual norms, such as refusing an arranged marriage or having relationships with unapproved, unrelated men. It is often a proxy murder, in which the order to kill is given out by the head of the family, usually the father, instructing a brother to kill his sister. In some very rare cases, hit men have been hired to perform the honor killings.

== Famous cases ==

=== John Bodkin Adams ===
A famous case involving proxy murder was that of John Bodkin Adams. John Bodkin Adams was an Irish physician who was investigated from 1946 to 1952 when 152 of his patients died mysteriously. Out of the 152, 130 of them mentioned Adams in their will, leaving him various amounts of money and items. Adams was accused of having his assisting nurses give lethal doses of opiates. Adams was arrested and tried for several counts of murder. He admitted to helping his nurses deliver morphine to patients, but he said it was to ease their passing, not to kill them. Adams was acquitted for several of the murders, and many others were withdrawn because the cases were not strong enough to hold up in court. In the end, Adams was convicted of fraud for lying on cremation papers.

=== Charles Manson ===
The person instigating a proxy murder may or may not be legally guilty of the crime of murder. This legal distinction varies where in the world the murder takes place. The person who instigated the murder is usually guilty as well. They may be charged with murder, conspiracy to commit murder, or being an accessory to murder. An example of this is Charles Manson and the Tate–LaBianca murders. Manson was the leader of the Manson Family cult that resided in California in the late 1960s. In 1969, some members of the Manson Family committed seven murders across a five-week span. One of the more notable people murdered was actress Sharon Tate. Charles Manson did not commit any of the murders himself, but instructed the members of the Manson family to commit them. In 1971, Manson was convicted on the charge of conspiracy to commit murder. The court ruled that Manson had as much guilt tied to him with that of his followers. Manson was sentenced to death initially, while later commuted to 9 concurrent life sentences at the Corcoran State Prison in California.

=== Mark Hopkinson ===
A notorious case of proxy murder was that of Mark Hopkinson, who ordered the bombing deaths of an attorney and his family in 1977 in Evanston, Wyoming. That bombing killed attorney Vincent Vehar, his wife, and one of his sons. 
While in prison awaiting trial for the Vehar murders, Hopkinson ordered the torture-murder of one of his employees, Jeff Green, who was about to testify against Hopkinson in court.

The man who bombed the Vehar house received a twenty-year sentence, but the hitmen who murdered Jeff Green have never been found. Hopkinson was nevertheless convicted of ordering all four murders and was executed by lethal injection in 1992.

<doc id="471718" wikidata="Q4570093" url="?curid=471718" title="Zhengyici Peking Opera Theatre">
<text>The Zhengyici Peking Opera Theatre (), located on a hutong in the Xuanwu District of Beijing, is one of the best-known Beijing opera theatres. It is also one of the oldest wooden theatres in China. Zhengyici means a temple (&quot;ci&quot;) for Zhengyi Xuantan Laozu (正乙玄坛老祖).

==History==
The theatre was built in 1688, during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty. It was built on the ruin site of a Buddhist temple. It has a rich history that includes performances by the grandmaster of Peking Opera, Mei Lanfang.

After the Cultural Revolution, the theatre fell into disrepair. However, in 1995 a local businessman sponsored a full restoration. The theatre now continues to perform Beijing Opera. It is considered a living relic and one of Beijing&#x27;s finest monuments.

In August 2005, the theatre was temporarily closed for building work. As of October 2010, the theatre was all set to reopen, with the premiere of Mei Lanfang Classics, providing a view of Peking Opera in its heyday. The play includes six classics from the 160 repertoires of Mei Lanfang, including Battle with Invaders, Drunken Princess, Goddess of Luo River, Taking Command of Troops, Sylph Scattering Flowers, and Farewell to Princess Yu.

On June 10, 2012, the theatre played host to American comedian Louis CK, who taped an episode of his show &quot;Louie&quot; there to an invitation-only audience.

<doc id="471724" wikidata="Q5630391" url="?curid=471724" title="HMAS Kapunda">
<text>HMAS &quot;Kapunda&quot; (J218/M218), named for the town of Kapunda, South Australia, was one of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes constructed during World War II, and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Kapunda&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Kapunda&quot; was laid down by Poole &amp; Steel at Balmain, New South Wales on 27 August 1941. She was launched on 23 June 1942 by Mary Quirk, the Member for Balmain in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, and was commissioned into the RAN on 21 October 1942.

==Operational history==
&quot;Kapunda&quot; entered service as a convoy escort along the east coast of Australia. Initially operating between Sydney and Brisbane, she was reassigned to the Queensland-New Guinea run in March 1943. &quot;Kapunda&quot; fired in anger for the first time during March, when eight Japanese bombers and twelve Japanese fighter aircraft attacked a convoy escorted by &quot;Kapunda&quot; and sister ship . Anti-aircraft fire from the two corvettes drove the aircraft off. On 12 April, a convoy under escort by the corvette was attacked by a formation of 37 Japanese aircraft. Several aircraft were destroyed by combined fire from &quot;Kapunda&quot; and the merchant ships, but the merchantman MV &quot;Gorgon&quot; was successfully hit and started to burn. &quot;Kapunda&quot; manoeuvred alongside the damaged ship and sent firefighting parties aboard, extinguishing the flames and helping &quot;Gorgon&quot; to proceed to port.

On 1 April 1944, the corvette was redeployed to New Guinea. &quot;Kapunda&quot; was tasked with convoy escort, anti-submarine patrol, and shore bombardment duties, and remained in the area until October 1944, when she returned to Sydney for refit. After the refit concluded in late November, she returned to her duties in New Guinea, and with the exception of a brief docking in Darwin in June 1945, served in these roles until the end of World War II.

Following the war, &quot;Kapunda&quot; was used to assist the evacuation of Allied prisoners-of-war from Kuching, and was the venue for the signing of the surrender of Japanese forces in the Kuching area, with Major General Yamamura signing the instrument of surrender on board. &quot;Kapunda&quot; returned to Australian waters in November 1945.

The corvette received two battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Pacific 1942–45&quot; and &quot;New Guinea 1943–44&quot;.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Kapunda&quot; was paid off into reserve on 14 January 1946. She was marked for disposal on 30 December 1960, and was sold on 6 January 1961 to Kinoshita (Australia) Pty Ltd for breaking up as scrap.

<text>The Isle of Meadows (also known as the Isle of Meadow) is a uninhabited island in the New York City borough of Staten Island in the United States. It is located along the western side of Staten Island, where Fresh Kills empties into the Arthur Kill. The island is owned by the city of New York. It is now a nature preserve providing important meadow and salt marsh nesting habitat for herons, ibises, and egrets, and is not open to the public.

<text>HMAS &quot;Katoomba&quot; (J204/M204), named after the tourist resort of Katoomba, New South Wales, was one of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes constructed during World War II, and one of 36 initially crewed and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of . The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Katoomba&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but crewed and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Katoomba&quot; was laid down by Poole &amp; Steel at Balmain, New South Wales on 9 September 1940. She was launched on 16 April 1941 by Mrs. Lloyd, then deputy mayoress of Katoomba, and was commissioned into the RAN on 17 December 1941.

==Operational history==
&quot;Katoomba&quot; entered active service with an assignment to Darwin, where she arrived on 19 December 1941. The next day, &quot;Katoomba&quot;, along with sister ships &quot;Deloraine&quot; and &quot;Lithgow&quot;, and the United States destroyer &quot;Edsall&quot;, was involved in the prosecution and successful sinking of Japanese submarine &quot;I-124&quot;, the first enemy submarine sunk in Australian waters. &quot;Katoomba&quot; was present during the Japanese bombing of Darwin on 19 February, but was not significantly damaged.

At the end of June, &quot;Katoomba&quot; was reassigned as a convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol ship in the waters of northern Queensland and New Guinea. On 14 August, &quot;Katoomba&quot; was sent to assist United States submarine &quot;S-39&quot;, which had run aground on a reef off Rossel Island. Attempts to refloat the submarine were unsuccessful, and on 16 August, the corvette left Rossel Island with &quot;S-39&quot;’s entire crew of 47 embarked. The submarine was gutted and left to break up naturally. On 28 November, &quot;Katoomba&quot; and sister ship &quot;Ballarat&quot; were attacked by a force of ten Japanese dive bombers. The corvettes escaped without serious damage. &quot;Katoomba&quot; was attacked again during January 1943, when a force of six Japanese aircraft attacked the corvette and the Dutch merchant ship &quot;Van Heutz&quot;. &quot;Katoomba&quot; escaped serious damage, but the merchantman was hit, with one man killed and three injured.

In February 1944, &quot;Katoomba&quot; ended her escort duties, and after a short period on patrol, was sent to Sydney for refitting. Upon her return to New Guinea waters in early May 1944, the corvette was assigned as an anti-submarine patrol ship. She remained in this role until the start of March 1945, although during this period she was occasionally used as an escort ship. The corvette returned to Australian waters, spent three months in Fremantle, then was assigned to Darwin, where she operated until the end of World War II.

After the war&#x27;s end, &quot;Katoomba&quot; was sent to the Japanese surrender at Timor, before assignment to mine-clearance duties throughout New Guinea waters. She returned to Sydney in October 1946, and was prepared for decommissioning, but was instead reactivated to help clear the coast of Queensland of mines.

&quot;Katoomba&quot; received three battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Darwin 1942&quot;, &quot;Pacific 1942–45&quot;, and &quot;New Guinea 1942–44&quot;.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Katoomba&quot; arrived in Fremantle on 16 January 1948, and was paid off into reserve on 2 August. She remained in reserve until 2 May 1957, when she was sold for breaking up as scrap to the Hong Kong Rolling Mills.

<text>Prall&#x27;s Island is an uninhabited island in the Arthur Kill between Staten Island, New York, and Linden, New Jersey, in the United States. The island is one of the minor islands that are part of the borough of Staten Island in New York City.

The island is named for a descendant or descendants of early Staten Island settler Arendt Jansen Prall Van Naarden (c. 1647–1725) (in Dutch, &quot;Praal&quot;), probably his grandson Abraham Prall (1706–1775), a local farmer. It was originally known as Dongan&#x27;s Island, after New York Governor Thomas Dongan (1634–1715), who took the office in 1688. The name was later corrupted to Duncan&#x27;s Island. Prall&#x27;s Island did not take hold until the late 19th century. Around 1910, the water between Staten Island and the island was known as Prall&#x27;s River but was eventually returned to Arthur Kill. The island is now owned by the City of New York and is maintained by New York City Department of Parks and Recreation as a bird sanctuary.

<doc id="471747" wikidata="Q995577" url="?curid=471747" title="Colt Canada C7 and C8">
<text>The Colt Canada C7 is the Canadian military’s adoption of Colt&#x27;s Armalite AR-15 platform, manufactured by Colt Canada (formerly Diemaco), having similar design and function to the M16A3.

The C7 and its variants have been adopted as the standard-issue rifle by the militaries of Canada, Norway (special forces only), Denmark and the Netherlands. Following trials, C8 variants are general-issue firearms for the United Kingdom&#x27;s Special Forces. The C8A1 is also the standard firearm of the Royal Netherlands Air Force and other specialist users within the Dutch and British militaries. It has been used in various combat deployments by Canadian, British, Norwegian, Dutch, and Danish forces in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Mali.

== History ==
The development of the C7 assault rifle paralleled that of the M16A2 by Colt. A Canadian Forces liaison officer worked with the United States Marine Corps in the M16A1 Product Improvement Program and relayed information to Canada&#x27;s Rifle Replacement Program Office. The C7 is more akin to the prototype M16A1E1, rather than the final M16A2s. The earliest C7s were manufactured by Colt for the Canadian Forces as the Colt Model 715. The C7 series of firearms is driven by the same Stoner bolt and carrier gas system as the M16 series. Like the M16A1 and M16A3, the C7 has both semi-automatic and fully automatic fire modes. The C7 also features the structural strengthening, spent case deflector, improved handguards, and longer stock developed for the M16A2.

== Design details ==
Diemaco changed the trapdoor in the buttstock to allow easier access to a small storage compartment inside the stock, and a spacer is available to adjust stock length and length of pull to user preference. For the furniture Diemaco chose &quot;Fiberlite&quot; nylon-reinforced polymer suitable for CRBN decontamination and cold weather use at . The carrying handle and rear sight assembly on top of the Diemaco C7 receiver features the most noticeable external difference between American M16A2s and C7s.
Diemaco C7s use a modified pre-M16A2 style two aperture L-type flip rear and front post iron sight line featuring two combat settings. An approximately diameter aperture rear sight is used for normal firing situations for target distances up to . A second larger approximately diameter aperture battle sight is used as a ghost ring for short range quick target engagement and during limited visibility.

The wing guards protected front sight was changed to a slimmer tapered round post of approximately diameter. C7 iron sights are normally zeroed with the normal use rear aperture sight at with SS109/M855/C77 ammunition. The rear sight can be zeroed for windage in 2.8 cm or 0.28 mrad increments at 100 m, when used with a rifle length sight radius. Elevation adjusting can be zeroed in 3.5 cm or 0.35 mrad increments at 100 m.
Not so apparent is Diemaco&#x27;s use of 1 in rifling twist hammer-forged chrome-lined barrel and chamber units with a slightly reducing bore diameter over the length of the rifling to increase longevity and accuracy.

These features were introduced as the Canadians originally wished to use a heavy barrel profile instead of the M16A2 profile. Diemaco developed a different mounting system from Colt for the Canadian M203 grenade launcher variant for the C7 rifle family and the bolt and bolt carrier were produced from stronger materials. Diemaco optimized the rifle for using 5.56×45mm NATO C77 cartridge L109 ball and the C78 cartridge longer L110 tracer projectiles by using a redesigned buffer assembly, thus making the M4-style extended feed ramps later introduced in the Colt M4 carbine unnecessary. The Canadian military initially ordered polymer STANAG compliant magazines for their C7s. As the prototypes failed the Canadian military trials, the C7 was introduced with aluminum STANAG compliant magazines. The C7 has a cyclic rate of fire of around 700–900 rounds per minute (RPM).

== Variants ==
===C7A1===
The C7A1 (Diemaco C7FT) replaces the iron sight/carrying handle assembly used on the C7 with a modified Weaver rail for mounting optics. Canadian development of rails preceded U.S. standardization of the MIL-STD-1913 &quot;Picatinny rail&quot;, so the &quot;Canadian Rail&quot; or &quot;Diemaco Rail&quot; differs slightly. There are 14 slots instead of 13, and each slot is narrower. The height of the rail is also higher, allowing the use of a normal-height front sight base whereas a Picatinny rail requires the use of a higher F-marked front sight base to raise the post. During development, the original rails were vacuum-bonded to the top of a bare receiver. For production, the rail and receiver were made out of a single forging.

The mount can use traditional iron sights or the ELCAN C79 Optical Sight 3.4×28 optical sight, both of which can be adjusted for individual eye relief. The optical sight was designed for the C9 light machine gun and includes horizontal and vertical mil-bars used for range determination and deflection, and a tritium glow-in-the-dark aiming post rather than the traditional crosshairs. The 3.4× is powerful enough to properly see targets at the maximum accurate range of , though like most magnified optical sights it is prone to criticism for creating tunnel vision in close quarters situations.

While the wide aperture helps to speed target acquisition, Canadian soldiers generally forgo the C79 sight in favour of non-magnified optical sights or a rear back up iron sight (BUIS) when engaged or training in close quarters battle. A detachable carrying handle and rear sight assembly can also be installed on top of the receiver. The BUIS and detachable carrying handle and rear sight assembly feature L-type rear sight apertures that are the same as used in the preceding fixed carrying handle and rear sight assembly. In the later years, upon request, Diemaco/Colt Canada would manufacture MIL-STD-1913 &quot;Picatinny rail&quot; upper receivers.

===C7A2===
With Canadian involvement in Afghanistan, Diemaco and the Canadian Forces developed improvements to the C7A1 to better suit the operational situations at hand. The result, the C7A2, has a four-point telescoping stock unit similar to that of the C8 carbine and a three-rail TRIAD that is clamped on the front sight base to allow accessories to be attached. The selector lever, magazine release, and charging handle latch became ambidextrous. Also, the C7A2 is issued with green colour furniture as standard.

These weapons are often seen with a similar plethora of accessories as their American counterparts given the overall commonalities of the system and the rail mounts. The C7A2 is also issued with the C79A2 ELCAN optical gunsight with 3.4× magnification but with a uniform green rubber armored coating, but some soldiers who are issued it have either been issued or have purchased sights like the EOTech holographic weapons sight and the Trijicon ACOG.

Within an eight-man section, six soldiers will normally carry a C7A2: the section commander and second in command, two grenadiers and two riflemen, with only the machine gunners carrying a C9A2 LMG. The C7A2 is considered a &quot;mid-life&quot; upgrade for the C7 family. The addition of the TRIAD rail mount has made it easier for soldiers to attach accessories such as laser designator and tactical lights. Many A2s are also seen with folding grips from Cadex Inc. under the handguards which can store 2 CR123 batteries.

The Canadian Forces is looking to upgrade and modernize their stockpile of C7A2 assault rifles, although nothing is yet official or certain as of 2022. One of the biggest upgrades that may be implemented is the replacement of the standard flat-top upper receiver with standard handguards, handguard end cap and front sight base with a monolithic upper receiver with integrated aluminium quad-rail handguard for increased modularity with accessories and free-floating the barrel for augmented precision. This would put the fleet of service rifles of the Canadian Armed Forces on par with Colt Canada&#x27;s latest offerings and upgrades of the Danish and Dutch militaries who have adopted rifles with monolithic upper receivers.

This variant will require the use of the Colt Canada M203A1 with a different mounting system due to the new aluminium quad-rail handguard. Since Colt Canada developed and released the MRR (Modular Rail Rifle) that uses a monolithic upper receiver with the Magpul M-LOK attachment system, the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) might be heading in that direction instead, along with a shorter, barrel, instead of the standard barrel, and straight gas tube with a low-profile gas block The possibility of using integrated suppressors is also something that is being looked into. A shorter charging-handle latch will be used instead of the very long C7A2 latch, which gets caught on equipment and vests, causing the latch to bend and break the charging-handle.

===C8===
The Colt Canada C8 carbine range are carbine variants of the C7 family, and are mechanically and visually very similar to the Colt Model 723 M16A2 carbine. Colt made the initial C8s for Canadian Forces as the Colt Model 725. The C8 has a A1 profile barrel like the Colt Model 653 M16A1 carbine, but with a 1 in rifling twist appropriate for adequately stabilizing the 5.56×45mm NATO C77 cartridge L109 ball and the C78 cartridge longer L110 tracer projectiles and the design improvements featured on C7 assault rifles. The C8 has a cyclic rate of fire of around 750–950 rounds per minute (RPM).

C8 iron sights are normally zeroed with the normal use rear aperture sight at with SS109/M855/C77 ammunition. The rear sight can be zeroed for windage in 3.8 cm or 0.38 mrad increments at 100 m, when used with a carbine length sight radius. Elevation can be zeroed in 4.7 cm or 0.47 mrad increments at 100 m. Once the iron sight line is zeroed, the front sight post and rear sight should not be moved.

===C8A1===
The C8A1 (Diemaco C8FT) is essentially a C8 carbine with a C7A1 flat-top upper receiver; the carbine having a barrel versus the barrel typically seen on the C7. The overall layout of the weapon remains essentially unchanged except for the upper receiver and the general inclusion of the C79 sight. C8A1s have also been more commonly seen with the detachable carry handle with A1 sights developed by Diemaco for both the C7FT and the C8FT. The C8A1 was never officially adopted by the Canadian Forces and was only used in Afghanistan for the ability to use the C79 optical sights.

===C8A2===
The C8A2 carbine is very similar to the C8, but having a cold-hammer forged heavy barrel, as opposed to the pencil-profile barrel previously used and a flat-top upper receiver.

===C8SFW===
The Special Forces Weapon (SFW) features a longer, barrel of a significantly heavier profile than the C8A1 and a Rail Adapter System (RAS) handguard. The SFW operating system is more copiously gassed when compared to the standard C8A1 to enhance reliability in the presence of heavy fouling or icing at the expense of moving the bolt and bolt carrier faster and harder against the accordingly adapted buffer assembly, resulting in a free recoil increase. It is designed to provide a fire support capability in carbine form. A sleeve, called the Simon Sleeve, is slipped over the end of the barrel and is retained by the compensator and its crush washer. It is used to mount standard issued C7 Nella bayonet, CAN bayonet 2000/2005 and M203A1s.

The front sight base is strengthened for mounting of the Heckler &amp; Koch AG-C/EGLM grenade launcher. The mass, muzzle velocity and effective range are stated as , and . The C8SFW is in service with the Norwegian Special Operations Forces as their standard rifle, as the more recently introduced HK416 does not feature a &quot;heavy profile barrel&quot; as the C8SFW. The United Kingdom Special Forces (UKSF) adopted a C8SFW variant, under the designation &quot;L119A1&quot;. In 2014, the UKSF upgraded to the &quot;L119A2&quot;, which features a custom Integrated Upper Receiver (IUR). The Royal Marines Commando have also began phase out the L85A2/L85A3 as their main rifle in favour of the L119.

===C8FTHB===
Concerns that Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry had with the C8 led to the creation of the C8FTHB. The C8FTHB (Flat Top Heavy Barrel) features numerous improvements over the C8, including a heavy profile cold hammer-forged M4 profile barrel featuring a grenade launcher cut out for mounting of the Canadian Forces M203A1 and bayonet and Elcan C79 Optical Sight.

Some of the earlier C8FTHB carbines used old refurbished C8 receivers. &quot;FTHB&quot; was stamped next to the C8 markings on the lower receivers. Colt Canada later manufactured new lower receivers with C8FTHB markings. Later, C8FTHB carbines that were upgraded to the C8A3 standard had &quot;A3&quot; stamped next to the markings, resulting in &quot;C8FTHBA3&quot; markings. Only 400 C8FTHBs were upgraded to C8FTHBA3s before Colt Canada started simply marking new receivers as &quot;C8A3&quot;.

===C8A3===

The C8FTHB was quickly replaced by the C8A3, which features the same cold-hammer forged barrel and flat-top upper receiver as the C8FTHB as well as all the mid-life upgrades that appeared on the C7A2 such as the green furniture, ambidextrous charging-handle latch, magazine release and selector lever. It also includes the TRIAD I rail for the C8, which has one slot less than the C7 TRIAD I, to accommodate the M203A1 sight.

===C8CQB===
Two additional C8 variants exist. The C8CQB is similar to the American Mark 18 Mod 0 CQBR, having a or heavy barrel and a Vortex Flash Hider made by Smith Enterprise Inc. The smaller Personal Defense Weapon (PDW) variant has an overall length of with its stock fully retracted. It has a barrel and the receiver has been shortened by .

===Diemaco LSW===

Colt and Diemaco also paired up to develop a squad automatic weapon variant of the series. The Diemaco Light Support Weapon (LSW) features an enlarged straight gas tube and an almost 1 inch thick heavy barrel to make the barrel less susceptible for overheating and hence increase the sustained or effective rate of fire capability. The LSW can only fire automatically and uses a proprietary Diemaco hydraulic buffer assembly. The LSW has a boxy square handguard with a carrying handle and a vertical foregrip that can be used as a monopod.

The LSW was made with no bayonet lug until 2001 due to the original bipod. A new bipod attaches to the same barrel yoke as the carrying handle and front grip, so current LSWs are made with a bayonet lug. Unlike many M16 variants, it fires from an open bolt, necessitating the removal of the forward assist for operating safety. It was the only weapon in the Diemaco product line to feature an M16A2-type fully adjustable rear sight, allowing the rear sight to be dialed in for specific range settings between 300 and 800 meters and to allow windage adjustments without the need of a tool or cartridge.

The LSW was used by the Royal Danish Army and is still used by the Netherlands Marine Corps (LOAW / LOAWNLD). It fires from a closed bolt and also has a semi-automatic firing mode and forward assist. The Diemaco LSW was originally a license produced variant of the Colt 750, but both Colt and Diemaco have upgraded their respective weapons to include features like a detachable carry handle.

===C7CT and C8CT===
Diemaco&#x27;s C7/C8 family also has two designated marksman rifle variants, the C7CT and C8CT, with CT being short for Custom Tactical. These accurized C7/C8 variants are designed to provide accurate engagement up to , while providing system commonality to other fielded weapons. They have two-stage match triggers and weighted stocks to counterbalance the heavy or free-floating barrel surrounded by a tubular forestock. A removable bipod, rails for designators, sling, etc. attach to that forestock. A special, distinctive pistol grip is fitted and the C7-style buttstock can be adjusted with shims. Sound suppressors are usually fitted. The rifle is designed as a sniper spotter weapon or a police containment weapon. The CT series weapons meet or exceed all applicable military standards including: reliability in all environmental and operational conditions, accuracy, lethality, maintainability in field conditions and safety.

Custom tactical features:
* Direct gas system: The unique direct gas system eliminates the operating rod and keeps all of the firing forces in line with the bore for maximum accuracy and reliability.
* Hammer forged heavy match barrel: The very heavy barrel profile maintains zero with accessories fitted and provides extra thermal mass to dissipate heat for enhanced consistency.
* Flat top: The upper receiver can be manufactured in the original Canadian Forces specification Weaver rail, or with a MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail.

===C10 small bore training version===
Diemaco offered a training version of the C7 named the C10, which would be a semi-automatic variant chambered in .22 Long Rifle ammunition. The polymer stock and lower receiver would be one piece. 
The C10 was proposed but never implemented. 

===IUR – Integrated Upper Receiver===
In 2008 or 2009, Colt Canada introduced a completely new designed upper receiver with integrated rail attachment system. The front handguard is in this system permanently attached to the upper receiver. The whole system is forged from one piece, and is sometimes called a monolithic rail. This system allows for a completely free floating barrel. Another unique feature is that the system can be adapted for different barrel lengths by screwing on an extension.

The system was introduced as an upgrade in the Dutch Army with the C7 and C8 in 2009.
In 2010, the C8 IUR (Integrated Upper Receiver) was introduced as an upgrade by all four branches of the Danish military and the Danish Security and Intelligence Service&#x27;s SWAT teams, as the &quot;Gevær M/10&quot;.
In 2011, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police adopted a semi-automatic only version of the C8 IUR with ancillary components as their patrol carbine.

===MRR – Modular Rail Rifle===
Colt Canada introduced the MRR, or Modular Rail Rifle, in 2015 and released it for sale to the market in 2016. It is essentially a monolithic upper receiver with Magpul&#x27;s M-LOK attachment system for accessories. The rifles are offered with barrels. The version features a shorter handguard. As of late 2016, the variant is offered only to law enforcement and the military.

===Denmark===

Denmark bought the first batch of C7A1 in 1995 and C8A1 in 1996, designating them the &quot;M/95&quot; and &quot;M/96 carbine&quot;. In 2004 the LSW, designated as the &quot;LSV M/04&quot; was added to the arsenal. These were to replace the German made M/75, which had been the main infantry weapon since 1975.

The C7A1 was issued to standard infantry units of the Royal Danish Army. The C8A1 is issued to units where the physically longer C7A1 could be obstructive to the unit&#x27;s primary work, such as logisticians, tankers and special units. The Denmark Special Forces, the Jægerkorpset and Frømandskorpset used the C8SFW, notably during the pull out of Afghanistan. The SSR, a special LRRP-unit under the Hjemmeværn command, also uses the C8SFW.

The LSW used to be issued to &quot;support gunners&quot; in infantry squads to get a lighter support weapon than the M/62 for patrolling in Afghanistan. The Royal Danish Army later adopted the M60E6 machine gun in 2014 for the support role. All LSWs have later been transferred to the Danish Home Guard.

The Army used the C7A1 designated M/95 and C8A1 designated M/96 with the Elcan C79 optical sight until the adoption of the M10 and was transferred to the Danish Home Guard who now use them along with the C8A2 with Aimpoint red dot sights.

The C7A1 was first issued to field units of Logcoy/Danbn/Dancon of the Danish International Brigade, in October–November 1995 shortly before the transition from UNPROFOR to IFOR in Bosnia.

On 4 January 2009, the Danish Army lost a number of weapons including M/95 and M/96 rifles to armed robbers who overpowered the guards at Antvorskov Barracks. The robbery was solely made possible because of inside knowledge and help. The police recovered the last of the stolen weapons on 22 November 2011.
In 2010 the Danish DALO(Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organization) ordered an improved version of the M/96 and M/95 from Colt Canada under the Danish designation M/10, which Colt Canada designated the &quot;C8 IUR&quot;. It features a free floating barrel, fully ambidextrous controls, flip up iron sights, a collapsible buttstock with more positions, and the Integrated Upper Receiver (IUR).

During the 2015 Copenhagen shootings, one victim was killed with an M/95 issued to the Danish Home Guard that was stolen in a home invasion robbery.

The M/10 has gone through multiple changes since its original introduction in the Danish Army, including an extension of the rail and removal of the built-in iron sights in favor of Magpul MBUS Picatinny mounted back-up sights, buttstock changed to Magpul CTR stocks, and an olive drab finish instead of the old black and is issued with ELCAN Spectre DR 1-4× optics. Magpul is to be switched out as the provider sometime soon as a new deal for weapon attachments was made in 2022.

===Netherlands===
After a selection process and trials program starting in 1991, the Netherlands purchased over 53,000 C7A1, C8A1 and LOAW weapons (C7 with polymer Thermold STANAG magazines in March 1994). The most commonly used version in the Netherlands Armed Forces was the C7 with iron sights. The Royal Netherlands Navy ordered only weapons fitted with magnifying sighting systems to fulfil its effective range requirement. The (Airmobile Brigade), consisting of 11 Infantry Battalion Garderegiment Grenadiers en Jagers, 12 Infantry Battalion Regiment Van Heutsz and 13 Infantry Battalion Regiment Stoottroepen Prins Bernhard uses the C7A1, and the C8A1 (Diemaco C8FT) was mainly used by the Korps Commandotroepen, the paratroopers of the Luchtmobiele Brigade (one company per battalion), the Korps Mariniers and most of the recon units of the various combat units, including the Forward Air Controllers and the reconnaissance units of the cavalry and the artillery. The Korps Mariniers also uses the LSW, which is locally known as LOAW.

From 2009 onwards many of the Dutch C7 assault rifles, C8 carbines and LOAW light machine guns received an overhaul: the black furniture was replaced with dark earth furniture. New parts include a new retracting stock, ambidextrous controls, the Diemaco Integrated Upper Receiver (IUR) with a free-floating barrel, RIS rails for mounting flashlights and laser systems, a vertical forward grip with built-in bipod also known as a &quot;Grip Pod&quot; and other accessories; the polymer STANAG magazines became not exclusively black in color as translucent smoke colored Lancer L5AWM 30-round magazines (NSN: 1005-01-657-7839L5) were also introduced along the Thermold magazines. The ELCAN 3.4× optical sight was also dropped in favour of the Swedish made non-magnifying Aimpoint CompM4 red dot sight and if desired an accompanying Aimpoint red dot magnifier. These upgraded versions are now designated as C7NLD, C8NLD, and LOAWNLD. The Dutch arms often feature an armorer white QR code on the right of the magazine housing.

===United Kingdom===


During the SFW trials, the C8 outperformed both the Heckler &amp; Koch G36 and the SIG SG551. The C8SFW was subsequently adopted in 2000 under the designation, L119A1.

Use of the C8 has expanded to include, among others, the original SAS and SBS, the Special Forces Support Group, the Pathfinder Platoon of 16 Air Assault Brigade, Royal Military Police Close Protection teams and MoD Police. Most weapons are now fitted with Knights Armaments Rail Adapter System handguards (that hold zero on the top and the bottom rails) and Picatinny rail flat-top upper receivers. The muzzle velocity and effective range are stated as and with a 400 mm (15.7&quot;) barrel and and with a 254 mm (10.0&quot;) CQB barrel.

Most users fit Trijicon ACOG 4×32 sights with CQB reflex attachment, but other sights are used. Various lasers, lights, foregrips and other attachments are used. Surefire 4-prong flash hiders are generally fitted, and suppressors are available. The standard Canadian bayonet is issued but rarely used. Coloured furniture is becoming commonplace. The United Kingdom prefers polymer magazines to metal ones on grounds of weight and reliability and has now standardised on these for all C8 and operational SA80 users, with well over a million magazines purchased. Many weapons are fitted with the L17A1 underslung 40 mm grenade launcher (UGL), the UK designation for the Heckler &amp; Koch AG-C/EGLM. Detachable shoulder stocks are available for stand-alone use of the UGL.

43 Commando Fleet Protection Group replaced their L85A2 rifles with the C8 in 2016. In 2019, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that the C8 would become the standard-issue rifle of the Royal Marines replacing the SA80.

In July 2013, the British Ministry of Defence contracted Colt Canada for a £2.8 million mid-life upgrade of the L119A1 carbines used by the United Kingdom Special Forces. Subsequently, from 2014 the L119A1 was upgraded to the L119A2. There are two L119A2 variants: The standard Carbine with a barrel and CQB (Close Quarter Battle) with a barrel. The CQB variant has seen the most widespread use. Both L119A2 variants feature a custom integrated upper receiver (IUR) with rails that hold zero all around, a lighter profile barrel, straight gas tubes, Geissele trigger, SureFire 4-prong flash hider, a tan coloured Magpul 6 position collapsible CRT buttstock, Ergo pistol grip, and ambidextrous controls.

===Botswana===

The Botswana Defence Force uses the MRR15.7M and MRR11.6S Modular Rail Rifle as patrol and Close Quarter Battle carbines. These feature an integrated upper receiver, ambidextrous controls, ambidextrous charging handle, custom folding front &amp; rear sights, tan coloured Magpul MOE pistol grip and Magpul CTR buttstock. They are deployed for national defence, foreign peace-keeping and anti-poaching tasks.

===Afghanistan===
In 2007 and 2008, Canada donated 2,500 surplus C7 assault rifles to the Afghan National Army. In 2011, the ANA gave back the C7s since as Afghan security forces chose the American M16 instead. Canadian Forces officials said the Canadian rifles would be shipped to Canada for disposal.

===Ukraine===
In 2022, Canada donated C7A1 and C8A1 Carbines to the Ukrainian Army.

<text>World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW), later known as the World Class Wrestling Association (WCWA), was an American professional wrestling promotion headquartered in Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas. Originally owned by promoter Ed McLemore, by 1966 it was run by Southwest Sports, Inc., whose president, Jack Adkisson, was better known as wrestler Fritz Von Erich. Beginning as a territory of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), it went independent in 1986 in a bid to become a major national promotion, but was unsuccessful in its attempts and eventually went out of business in 1990. Rights to the pre-1989 WCCW tape library belong to WWE (the post-1988 rights are owned by International World Class Championship Wrestling) and select episodes from 1982 to 1988 are available on the WWE Network.

World Class Championship Wrestling experienced tremendous success from 1981–1985, shattering attendance records and achieving global exposure through their syndicated television program. Bookers Ken Mantell, David Von Erich, Gary Hart, Bruiser Brody and Kevin Von Erich provided fans with hard hitting action centered on the popular Von Erich brothers and a cast of devious villains. Storylines during this time followed a consistent theme of friendship and betrayal, with many of the top villains being first presented as friends to the Von Erich Family, only to betray them months or even years later. Talent deals and exchanges helped WCCW bring in future stars such as Chris Adams, The Fabulous Freebirds, Jake Roberts, Mick Foley, a young Shawn Michaels, Gino Hernandez and Iceman King Parsons, and others.

World Class Championship Wrestling was a member of the NWA and was originally known as Big Time Wrestling until 1982, when Adkisson decided that the name of his federation needed to be changed. Mickey Grant, who headed the production of its telecasts (known as Texas Championship Wrestling), suggested the name World Class. WCCW operated its enterprise in Dallas, Texas and held wrestling events at the Reunion Arena, and mostly at the famed Sportatorium, located just south of Downtown Dallas, which was also a well-known boxing and wrestling arena as well as the one-time home to the famous Big D Jamboree.

==History==
===Big Time Wrestling (1966–1981)===

WCCW was originally known as Big Time Wrestling and, until the late 1970s, was dominated by its owner, Fritz Von Erich. In 1966, Von Erich and Ed McLemore-owner of the Dallas Sportatorium- bought out the Dallas/Fort Worth Wrestling Office, breaking away from Houston Wrestling Office, which was managed by Paul Boesch. In 1969, Von Erich took sole control over the Office after McLemore died from a heart attack, and also gained ownership of the Dallas Sportatorium. Initially playing his longtime role of a snarling, goose-stepping Nazi monster heel and sometimes teaming with &quot;brother&quot; Waldo, Fritz turned babyface in late 1966 and began feuding with Gary Hart and his stable of wrestlers (which at this time included Karl Von Brauner, Al Costello and the masked Spoilers); the feud between Hart and Fritz (and his sons) would continue off and on for more than two decades. Fritz&#x27;s other classic rivalries during this early period were with such stars as Johnny Valentine, Stan Stasiak, Professor Toru Tanaka, Lord Alfred Hayes, The Sheik, Bruiser Brody and The Great Kabuki. Babyface wrestlers playing secondary roles in the promotion at various times included Wahoo McDaniel, Pepper Gomez, Red Bastien, Jose Lothario and Lonnie &quot;Moondog&quot; Mayne. Many of these wrestlers were regular mainstays of the Grand Olympic Auditorium wrestling promotion in Los Angeles, who would compete in Dallas regularly, as did Fritz and several Texas-based wrestlers doing the same for Gene and Mike LeBell&#x27;s promotion in L.A.

As his sons began to launch wrestling careers of their own in the mid-to-late 1970s, Fritz gradually cut back on his in-ring appearances and concentrated on promoting, finally retiring from the ring altogether after a 1982 NWA American Title win over King Kong Bundy at Texas Stadium in Irving. By then, the promotion had switched to the World Class name and was centered on Fritz&#x27;s sons, Kevin, David, Kerry, and later, Mike Von Erich.

===Boom years (1982–1986)===

Developed and booked by manager and behind-the-scenes booker Gary Hart, World Class&#x27; most storied feud was the legendary and long-running battle between the Von Erichs and the Freebirds, which began on December 25, 1982 during an NWA World title match between Kerry Von Erich and champion Ric Flair at Reunion Arena in Dallas. After several of Flair&#x27;s title defenses against Kerry ended in controversy with the champion retaining the belt by various illegal means (including an earlier match which involved a corrupt referee, Alfred Neely), the promotion had finally booked a rematch between the two in a steel cage to prevent any interference, and announced a write-in poll in which fans could vote for the wrestler they wanted to serve as special referee for the match. Freebird Michael Hayes, whose popularity in WCCW at that point was second only to the Von Erichs themselves, was selected to officiate, and his tag team partner Terry Gordy was at ringside to guard the cage door. However, when Kerry refused to pin Flair following unwanted interference on his behalf by Hayes, the Freebirds turned on Von Erich, with Gordy slamming the door on Kerry&#x27;s head. Backup referee David Manning banished Hayes and Gordy to the dressing room, and the match ended shortly thereafter, with Flair retaining the title yet again as Manning stopped the match due to Kerry&#x27;s inability to continue the match. Shortly after, Gary Hart left WCCW, due to money issues with Von Erich; the Freebirds wanted to follow suit, but Hart persuaded them to stay in WCCW. A year later, Gordy would have his head slammed by the cage door from Fritz Von Erich, in retaliation.

The Freebird-Von Erich rivalry was one of the most violent feuds in modern-day wrestling history and continued off-and-on for much of the decade; Parsons, Adams, &quot;Gorgeous&quot; Jimmy Garvin and members of Skandor Akbar&#x27;s Devastation Inc. stable were also involved in the Freebird-Von Erich feud directly or indirectly during the course of the angle. The official last match between the Freebirds and the Von Erichs took place in April 1993 in Dallas.

====1983====
Buddy Roberts was involved in several conflicts in 1983 with &quot;Iceman&quot; King Parsons, including a match in which Roberts lost his hair in a &quot;hair vs hair&quot; match despite winning the match. Parsons, who lost the match, managed to grab the infamous &quot;Freebird Hair Cream&quot; (used as a plot device in earlier matches as a fictional hair remover) and rub the contents onto Roberts&#x27; head. This prompted Roberts to wear a wig and headgear to cover his bald head, whose hair grew back in a time span of six months.

A secondary feud was born between Jimmy Garvin, who had spent much of 1983 feuding with David Von Erich, against England&#x27;s Chris Adams. Adams faced Garvin for the first time on August 26, 1983 at the Dallas Sportatorium, both wrestling to a time-limit draw. Afterwards, both Garvin and Adams exchanged insults, calling each other a &quot;coward&quot;, with Adams challenging Garvin to a title match on October 7, as Garvin was about to face David Von Erich (which proved to be the last-ever match between Garvin and Von Erich). The angle reached new heights on October 21 when Adams disguised himself as &quot;The Masked Avenger&quot; and faced Garvin. Playing possum, Adams surprised Garvin with some wrestling moves, and then as he threw Garvin to the ropes, Chris superkicked him, which stunned the Sportatorium crowd and announcer Bill Mercer who said &#x27;&quot;a thrust kick...HEY that looks like...here it is; 1, 2, 3; a superkick&quot;. Afterwards, he unmasked to reveal himself as Chris Adams, which proved to be a turning point in Adams&#x27; tenure in World Class; elevating him from mid-card to main-event status. Sunshine, who used to be Garvin&#x27;s valet, joined Adams&#x27; side two weeks later, and with Sunshine in his corner, Adams defeated Garvin for the American title on November 24 at Reunion Arena; the first of five NWA American/World Class heavyweight title reigns for the British star. Adams and Garvin traded the American title on numerous occasions and engaged in mixed tag team matches involving Sunshine and Precious. It was said to be among the first mixed tag-team matches in modern wrestling history and would pave the way for future mixed tag team matches, including one Adams promoted himself six years later involving two of his ex-wives (Jeanie Clark and Toni Adams) and his protégé Steve Austin.

====1984====
On February 10, 1984, at the height of the Von Erich-Freebird wars, David Von Erich died from an intestinal rupture caused by a stomach ailment just after arriving in Japan for a tour for All Japan Pro Wrestling. Although Ric Flair asserted in his autobiography that most people in wrestling believe David died of a drug overdose, with Bruiser Brody flushing pills down a hotel toilet before the police arrived, David&#x27;s autopsy report indicated no drugs in his system and that his death was definitely caused by acute enteritis. His death was front-page news in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, triggering an area-wide outpouring of shock and grief among fans, and was the beginning of the Von Erichs&#x27; decline and fall (and WCCW&#x27;s as well, although attendance levels would remain high for a time).

His death prompted a few changes in upcoming events. The February 10 non-televised card at the Dallas Sportatorium was to have Kamala, The Missing Link and Jimmy Garvin face Chris Adams and Kevin and Kerry Von Erich in the main event. Instead, Brian Adias and King Parsons took Kevin and Kerry&#x27;s places, and the trio of Adams, Parsons and Adias defeated Kamala, Link and Garvin in an emotional match for all involved. The February 13 card, featured Marc Lowrance and David Manning in the ring alongside Sunshine, Adams, Parsons, Adias, Junkyard Dog, Chief Jules Strongbow, Jimmy Phillips, Bronko Lubich and Johnny Mantell as a ten-bell salute to honor David Von Erich was carried out. David&#x27;s funeral took place two days later, and an estimated 5,000 people paid tribute to the fallen star; one of the largest funeral gatherings to take place in the Metroplex at the time.

A March 3, 1984 telecast of &quot;World Class Championship Wrestling&quot; was dedicated exclusively to the life of David Von Erich, with wrestlers Michael Hayes, Jimmy Garvin, Harley Race, Chris Adams and Ric Flair paying tribute to the fallen hero. Bill Mercer and Mickey Grant also provided footage of David&#x27;s earlier times as a high school basketball standout and had an interview with Fritz, Kevin and Kerry during the broadcast. The Von Erichs, who took David&#x27;s death extremely hard, did not compete again until February 27, when they teamed with Adams to defeat Butch Reed, Jimmy Garvin, Michael Hayes and Terry Gordy. David had been seen by many in the NWA as potential World Championship material. According to Ric Flair, David had indeed been chosen by the NWA to become the World Heavyweight Champion and Flair also stated in his autobiography &quot;To Be The Man&quot; that had David lived, he would have had the potential to be a long-term NWA Champion.

On May 6, 1984, as a tribute to his late brother, Kerry Von Erich finally defeated Ric Flair after a hard-fought 14-minute battle to win the title at the first annual &quot;David Von Erich Memorial Parade of Champions&quot; supercard held at Texas Stadium in Irving. However, because Kerry already had a reputation within the industry for being unreliable due to substance abuse, the NWA only allowed him a brief title reign; he lost the belt back to Flair in Yokosuka, Japan on May 24 (May 23 in the U.S.) in another hard-fought match. The match, which did not air on television initially, allowed World Class to use an angle in which Flair cheated in the match, and claimed the referee was a sumo official who did not understand the rules of pro wrestling. The match, which Flair won with a clean pinfall over Kerry, in fact was officiated by veteran All Japan Pro Wrestling referee Joe Higuchi, who found David Von Erich&#x27;s body the previous February, and was also the one who alerted David Manning of his death.

Afterwards, the Freebirds left World Class in the summer of 1984, and, except for a few appearances, did not return full-time until December 1985. Jimmy Garvin and Precious also departed WCCW during this time to join the AWA. An unusual three-way feud ensued during the summer of 1984 involving Killer Khan, originally brought in by the Freebirds in their quest to destroy the Von Erichs, fighting the Freebirds and Von Erichs after Khan was bought by General Skandor Akbar. During one match at the Sportatorium, Michael Hayes and Kevin Von Erich took turns attacking Khan, shoving each other away in the process.

One of the top angles of the summer of 1984 was a mixed feud between Gino Hernandez and Nickla Roberts (aka Baby Doll, billed as &quot;Andrea The Lady Giant&quot;) against Mike Von Erich and Stella Mae French. The angle reached new heights in the fall of 1984 when Sunshine, arriving on a helicopter at the Cotton Bowl, interfered in a match, allowing French to pin Roberts. This angle, which also involved Chris Adams, ended in 1985.

With The Freebirds out of the picture and attempting other angles that proved to be not as highly successful as the Freebirds-Von Erichs wars, World Class decided to turn Chris Adams heel and start a long and legendary war which lasted for over a year, and at the same time, drawing revenues that exceeded the Freebirds-Von Erichs angle. The new angle was developed by Ken Mantell, Gary Hart, Chris Adams and Fritz Von Erich, which was born out of a conversation between Adams and Hart, where Adams wanted to change his image and try his luck as a heel wrestler.

Gary Hart, who left World Class in early-1983 due to a dispute with Fritz Von Erich over the booking of the Freebirds-Von Erich feud, returned to World Class in August to scout the babyface talent, including Adams, Iceman King Parsons, Brian Adias and others. Towards the end of the month, Adams, who had returned from his tenure in Los Angeles during the 1984 Summer Olympics, announced his alliance with Hart, which resulted in some friction between Adams and the babyfaces.

On September 28, 1984, Adams was paired with Kevin Von Erich against Jake Roberts and Gino Hernandez, with Gary Hart and Stella Mae French in Adams and Von Erich&#x27;s corner. As the match wound down, Hernandez had Adams in a high vertical suplex, with French tripping Hernandez, causing Adams to land on Gino; however he rolled over on top of Chris and pinned him. After the match, an enraged Adams began arguing with French, with Hart and Kevin coming in as peacemakers. Hart later abused Stella Mae, prompting Kevin to shove him to the corner of the heels&#x27; side of the ring. Out of nowhere, Adams blasted Kevin with a superkick, which prompted Hernandez and Roberts to throw French out of the ring and attack Kevin, while Adams and Hart walked away. The two-on-one gangup continued (which included Roberts&#x27; patented DDT) until Buck Zumhofe and David Manning ran in to chase Roberts and Hernandez away.

The following Monday in Fort Worth on October 1, 1984; Adams was selected as the mystery partner in a six-man tag match for Hernandez and Roberts in a match against Kerry and Mike Von Erich, with Buck Zumhofe subbing for Kevin. As Adams gave Mike a backdrop from the canvas using his legs, Kevin stormed the ring and attacked Adams, resulting in a brawl between the former friends and tag partners until David Manning, Bronco Lubich, Rick Hazzard and Gary Hart separated the two.

On October 27, Adams and Von Erich squared off at the Cotton Bowl, with Kevin winning the match, amid controversy when Adams lifted his shoulder at the count of one, but referee David Manning counted to three with Adams lifting his shoulder again, believing he was at the count of two. Afterwards, Kevin made a deal with Chris: leave Gary Hart and go on his own and all would be forgiven. Adams responded by attacking Kevin with a chair. Unintentionally, Adams hit Kevin in the head hard enough for the chair to break in half, causing Kevin some bleeding from the head and resulting in his hospitalization for a few days. The Adams-Von Erich feud had been set up in this way because Fritz Von Erich felt that too many fans were siding with Adams, and after the Cotton Bowl incident, Adams still heard cheers from some of the fans. A month later, Kevin returned the favor by smashing a chair into Adams&#x27; head after losing to him, and that resulted in Chris being helped out of the arena with a minor concussion and nearly losing his left eye when a piece of the wooden chair lodged onto his nose after the chair shot, very dangerously close to his eye. The wooden chair angle was quickly scrapped at Kevin and Chris&#x27; requests due to the legitimate injuries both wrestlers sustained. Adams eventually became World Class&#x27; biggest heel; yet at the same time, as the feud with the Von Erichs progressed, he began facing other heels, such as Ric Flair and members of Skandor Akbar&#x27;s army.

By 1985, Adams began tagging with Hernandez, forming the second and most successful version of The Dynamic Duo (Tully Blanchard and Hernandez formed the original version). Towards the end of the year, Adams and Hernandez used scissors (a gimmick that Brutus Beefcake would use later on in the WWF) to cut hair off opponents after each of their matches, and this resulted in a Cotton Bowl showdown in October 1985, in which Kevin and Kerry Von Erich defeated Adams and Hernandez in a losers-lose-hair match. Adams and Hernandez eventually broke up and began feuding, and faced each other in a January 1986 match where the loser would have his hair removed with Freebird Hair Cream (a gimmick used in a June 1983 match between Iceman Parsons and Freebird Buddy Roberts). Adams had the match won, but picked Hernandez up twice to dish out more punishment, and while he was arguing with the referee, Hernandez grabbed the hair cream and threw the contents in Adams&#x27; face, thus &quot;blinding&quot; him. Adams won the match by DQ as a result. However, by the time this angle aired on television a few days later, Hernandez was dead; his death, which was revealed by an autopsy to be the result of a cocaine overdose, ended any prospects of a hot feud between the former partners. The Scotland Yard questioned Adams regarding Hernandez&#x27;s death, but no charges were ever filed against him. The original plan for the Adams-Hernandez feud was for Chris to return to face Hernandez at the Texas Stadium card after Adams&#x27; tour of Japan and visiting relatives in England, and stretch the feud out through much of 1986 which also involved mixed tag team matches.

====1985====
A brief yet high-profile angle between Chris Adams and Great Kabuki was played out during the summer of 1985 over which wrestler had the most lethal kick: Chris Adams and his superkick or Kabuki and his thrust kick. The angle was born in the spring of 1985 when manager Sunshine brought Kabuki in to battle Adams and Gino Hernandez. Both wrestlers displayed their martial arts talent in their matches, and during one singles match at the Dallas Sportatorium, half of the crowd was chanting for Adams, while the other half was chanting for Kabuki. Both Adams and Kabuki would have sporadic matches, both singles and tag team, through 1986.

In 1985, World Class went on a major tour to the Middle East (including Israel). The tour, which ran from August 3 through August 7, was held mostly in Tel Aviv, and proved to be extremely successful, but was also the start of another episode for the Adkisson family, as it was during this tour that Mike Von Erich suffered a separated shoulder (in a tag team match with Kevin against Gino Hernandez and Chris Adams) that led to his near-fatal bout with toxic shock syndrome following surgery. In an ill-advised desperation move that would later infamously backfire, Fritz brought in Pacific Northwest Wrestling Champion, Ricky Vaughn, as &quot;cousin&quot; Lance Von Erich to fill the gap while Mike was recovering. Fritz billed Lance as the &quot;son&quot; of Waldo Von Erich, with whom Fritz tagged years earlier, but was not related to Fritz in any way. Vaughn made his WCCW debut at the 1985 Cotton Bowl event. To this day, it was considered to be the worst idea that Fritz came up with. The main participants on the Israel tour included Kevin and Mike Von Erich, Chris Adams, Gino Hernandez, Iceman King Parsons, Freebird Buddy Roberts, Scott Casey, Brian Adias, Rip Oliver, Kelly Kiniski and Johnny Mantell.

===Independence from the NWA (1986–1988)===
On February 4, 1986, local authorities and friends of Gino Hernandez - now one of the company&#x27;s major stars - discovered him dead in his apartment. In addition, the NWA President at the time, Jim Crockett, Jr., had also decided that he would no longer book the NWA World Champion at the time, Ric Flair, to wrestle in the state of Texas. World Class, still reeling over the death of Gino Hernandez, withdrew its membership from the NWA on February 18, 1986, became known as the World Class Wrestling Association, yet they retained the &quot;World Class Championship Wrestling&quot; name for its broadcasts and matches after the 1985 Cotton Bowl event were sanctioned by the World Class Wrestling Association. The NWA American Heavyweight Championship, which had been the promotion&#x27;s top championship for nearly 20 years, was immediately renamed and declared it to be their &quot;World&quot; title and Rick Rude, the holder of the American Heavyweight Championship, was recognized as the promotion&#x27;s first World champion. While there is no official means of granting a championship &quot;World&quot; title status in professional wrestling, &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; didn&#x27;t recognize the championship&#x27;s status as a &quot;World&quot; title as it had with the American Wrestling Association (AWA), NWA, and World Wrestling Federation (WWF) championships. It was rumored that the NWA didn&#x27;t want to give Kerry the title back, and the NWA didn&#x27;t recognize the faster pace of the sport. The new corporation also gained a deal with ESPN to air a weekly show on the network as well. As a result of the NWA withdrawal, the WCWA also introduced a title-change rule in which a champion could lose the belt on a disqualification or a countout, much to the dismay of heel wrestlers, who opt to DQ themselves to keep the championship (most notably Ric Flair). That rule had been in place during the 1984 NWA World Heavyweight Championship match between Flair and Kerry Von Erich, and had been used sporadically before World Class seceded from the NWA, including its TV championship.

The Freebirds-Von Erich war reignited in late 1985, with Hayes, Gordy and Roberts against Kevin, Kerry and Lance Von Erich; reborn following a surprise gang-up on Kevin and Kerry during a match in Fort Worth, with announcer Marc Lowrance exclaiming that &quot;The Devil has emerged&quot; when returning from the commercial break. John Tatum and Missy Hyatt entered the promotion, and started a feud with The Fantastics and Sunshine. Chris Adams returned in April to do two house shows, and in May received a huge ovation from the crowd at Texas Stadium in his first televised match since the &quot;blinding&quot; angle. Chris did begin an angle with Rick Rude; but not before becoming a full-fledged face. However, when the WCWA was formed Fritz von Erich refused to book his shows outside of Dallas. This move led to a disputes with Fritz von Erich and the company&#x27;s head booker Ken Mantell, who soon left the WCWA to become the head booker for the newly formed Universal Wrestling Federation(UWF); Referee David Manning took Mantell&#x27;s place. After Mantell&#x27;s departure in May 1986, attendance for WCWA shows began to drop greatly; along with Mantell, the new UWF was able to lure away more WCWA talent as well.

During a May 26, 1986 six-man tag match at Will Rogers Coliseum in Fort Worth, Adams was paired with Lance and Kevin Von Erich against Rick Rude, Kabuki and the One Man Gang. It was the first time since September 30, 1984 that Adams (substituting for the injured Bruiser Brody) was partnered with a Von Erich in any tag team match, and there was still some tension between Kevin and Chris in the early-going, but that eventually changed as the match progressed. As the match wound down, the One Man Gang was about to launch a major assault on Kevin with a chain, as Kevin was recovering from a double clothesline by OMG and Rude. As referee Rick Hazzard was trying to separate Rude and Lance, Adams entered the ring and superkicked OMG, then rolled Kevin on top of him and alerted Hazzard of the winning pinfall. After the match, with Chris, Lance and Kevin standing in the center of the ring, Kevin extended his hand, and Chris shook it and the two embraced in the center of the ring, signaling the end of World Class Championship Wrestling&#x27;s most storied feud. Adams also feuded with Tatum and Hyatt, with Sunshine once again managing Chris, and also began wrestling against Matt Borne and Buzz Sawyer.

Chris evidently continued wrestling against Rude on several occasions, and in one match after a &quot;Rude Awakening&quot; neckbreaker, Chris &quot;regained his eyesight.&quot; With the patch gone, Chris became the number one contender to Rude&#x27;s World Class heavyweight title, and on July 4, 1986, he won it after a hard-fought and bloody battle at Reunion Arena in Dallas. Adams won with a small package when interference from Rude&#x27;s manager Percy Pringle backfired. Over the course of the next three months, Chris defended the title almost every week, against challengers like Rude, Kabuki, One Man Gang, Blackjack Mulligan and others. In a non-title match at the Dallas Sportatorium, he lost to the Ultimate Warrior, who was then known as the Dingo Warrior. In that match, Adams used a piledriver on the Warrior, and somehow the force of the piledriver hit Adams&#x27; throat; which had been hit earlier due to interference by manager Percy Pringle during a pre-match altercation. Unable to continue, Adams allowed the Warrior to pin him following a flying elbow. Chris gave the Warrior a title shot, and narrowly defeated him. Adams also faced Abdullah the Butcher in some matches, all of which ended either in a countout or a DQ against Abdullah. Mulligan and Bruiser Brody were involved in a three-way feud during that time; while South African Steve Simpson joined World Class as an ally of Adams and the Von Erichs. Between July and September 1986, many of the top stars of World Class, including Adams, Parsons, Hyatt, John Tatum, and the Freebirds, defected to the Universal Wrestling Federation, following longtime WCCW booker Ken Mantell, who had resigned and joined the UWF after a falling-out with Fritz.

World Class heavyweight champion Chris Adams was forced to relinquish his championship on September 17, 1986; one day after being convicted of misdemeanor assault from an incident on June 30, 1986 inflight between San Juan, Puerto Rico and Dallas. According to testimony and accounts from the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot;, Adams, who was under the influence, verbally assaulted a stewardess when he became belligerent when it was announced that liquor sales would no longer be available in flight. He then head-butted an American Airlines co-pilot before Kevin Von Erich restrained Adams. He left World Class shortly thereafter and joined Ken Mantell in the UWF, when it was told that Adams would lose the belt to Black Bart on September 19 at the Dallas Sportatorium, a decision that enraged Adams, then-booker Gary Hart and several other wrestlers. Adams was sentenced on October 25 to 90 days in jail and fined $500. He began his sentence on November 1, and was released on January 29, 1987. Kevin Von Erich later defeated Black Bart for the World Class heavyweight title at the Cotton Bowl, and held that belt for nearly a year.

It was also at this point that Kerry Von Erich was involved in a motorcycle accident (June 4, 1986) and suffered injuries that later worsened when he attempted to return to the ring too soon (an attempt said by some observers to have taken place under heavy pressure from Fritz) and would finally necessitate the amputation of his right foot. As a result of this accident, the organization&#x27;s attendance dropped greatly. WCCW&#x27;s fortunes declined further in 1986–87 with the Texas oil businesses entering a recession and Mike Von Erich&#x27;s health and substance abuse problems and eventual suicide. As a result of these multiple catastrophes, attendance in both Dallas and Fort Worth plummeted; according to some former WCCW wrestlers, many fans became disillusioned with the Von Erichs as the supposedly &quot;clean-living&quot; brothers&#x27; drug use became harder to cover up, and they frequently no-showed cards the promotion booked in smaller towns. Sportatorium cards, which at the beginning of the year before drew well over 4,000 had dropped to less than 1,000 within a time span of six months.

In an attempt to keep World Class hot, by means of running long-term angles, Brian Adias, who was billed as the childhood friend of the Von Erichs (which is legitimate, since Brian grew up with the Adkissons in Denton and also went to high school with Kerry), began a storyline with them by turning heel against Mike Von Erich during a match, then eventually began feuding with Kevin Von Erich later on. This angle, similar to the one used with Chris Adams in 1984, proved to be unsuccessful, and pairing Adias with Alberto Madril to form a newer version of &quot;The Dynamic Duo&quot; (and even going so far as using Adams and Hernandez&#x27;s &quot;Bad to the Bone&quot; as their ring entrance music) made matters worse. Adias lacked the charisma and talent that Adams had during his feud with the Von Erichs, and Kevin and Mike dominated this feud from start to finish. There was one high mark in that feud, when Kevin passed out from concussion complications during an eight-man tag team match. That incident was worked into an angle in which Adias tried to end Von Erich&#x27;s career by applying the Oriental Spike, a finisher made famous by Terry Gordy. Madril often drew the ire of the crowd by shouting in Spanish, sometimes using obscene language. The Los Angeles native eventually turned babyface and began feuding with Adias by 1987. Late in the year, the promotion briefly added another show to its lineup called Texas Championship Wrestling, which aired nationally on the now defunct cable network Tempo Television, filling a void left by the folding of USA All-Star Wrestling. The new show retained USA All-Star Wrestling&#x27;s Steve Stack as its host and was taped at Gilley&#x27;s Club in Pasadena, Texas, the site of its predecessor. The matches and interviews on Texas Championship Wrestling did not acknowledge the ongoing storylines taking place on the territory&#x27;s other current television shows.

====1987====
Between late-1986 and the latter part of 1987, World Class was behind the UWF as the top promotion, but things were about to change soon, which would include the return of many major World Class stars by year&#x27;s end. In April, World Class suffered another death when Mike Von Erich, after being diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome, was found dead near Lewisville Lake, having committed suicide by overdosing on Placidyl. The upcoming Parade of Champions card held in May was renamed in honor of both David and Mike Von Erich. This event, which drew over 20,000 fans the previous three years, drew less than 6,000 for the 1987 event, which featured Kevin Von Erich defending the World Class title against Nord The Barbarian, who in actuality was a protégé of Bruiser Brody&#x27;s. To make matters worse, the WWF had also reached the pinnacle of its success at WrestleMania III, and began to gain more national exposure. The Dallas Sportatorium received a facelift with a new ring and red, yellow and blue ring ropes with a World Class banner placed at Section D of the arena, with the American flag moved to Section C. By now, attendance for WCCW shows was nearly dead. Gary Hart (who along with Brody were now World Class&#x27; main go-to people) formed a new stable alongside wrestler/manager Phil Apollo (who was then known as &quot;Vince Apollo&quot;) which included Brian Adias, Al Madril, and Al Perez, who would eventually win the World Class heavyweight title by August. Eric Embry, Frankie Lancaster, The Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll RPMs (Mike Davis and Tommy Lane), and Jason Sterling (the son of The Missing Link) also competed for a time in World Class.

In mid-1987, after the buyout of the UWF by Jim Crockett Promotions, Ken Mantell launched his own Wild West Wrestling promotion with the popular Fort Worth nightspot Billy Bob&#x27;s Texas as its homebase. Headlining for Mantell&#x27;s group were such former World Class stars as Fabulous Lance (formerly Lance Von Erich, who by then had walked out on Fritz in a dispute over money), Wild Bill Irwin, The Missing Link, Buddy Roberts, Brian Adias, Jack Victory, Tatum and Parsons. Bill Mercer left World Class to become the ring announcer for Wild West Wrestling. After only a few months, Mantell agreed to return to WCCW as co-promoter with Kevin and Kerry Von Erich, following Fritz&#x27;s decision to sell out his interest in the promotion; Wild West was absorbed into WCCW, and most of its talent — with the notable exception of Fabulous Lance, who was now considered &quot;persona non grata&quot; by the Adkissons after his abrupt departure earlier in the year — returned along with Mantell. The organization later co-promoted cards with World Class, including a May 1988 card in Mesquite, Texas which had Marc Lowrance as the ring announcer, and former World Class referee Jerry Usher officiating several matches. Wild West Wrestling continued promoting cards at Billy Bob&#x27;s until late 1988, with its programming now featuring its Championship Sports broadcasts from the Sportatorium.

Chris Adams, who stayed with the NWA following their buyout with the UWF, abruptly left the NWA over a money dispute (reportedly against the wishes of Michael Hayes to stay), and returned to World Class beginning with the October 3, 1987 card at The Sportatorium. Upon returning, Adams worked an angle with Al Perez and manager Gary Hart, engaging in several matches — including one in which he supposedly won the World Class title following a victory over Perez. The decision was reversed by referee John Keeton who was pushed into Adams&#x27;s superkick by Perez (backup ref Bronco Lubich made the three-count when Adams surprised Perez with a sunset flip), thus Keeton DQed Adams and Perez retained the championship, a match which fans felt was a Dusty Finish. Al Perez stated in a 2018 interview that the plan was for Adams to regain the World Class belt from him, however Fritz Von Erich ruled against it and told Perez that he is to remain the champion.

Adams also engaged in a brief feud with Brian Adias, mostly out of the rights to use the ring entrance music &quot;Bad to the Bone&quot;, which Adias used, much to the objection of Adams, who was best known for this ring entrance music with Gino Hernandez. Chris also had some bouts with Eric Embry and Vince Apollo for a short time.

Kerry Von Erich also returned to World Class, wrestling with a prosthetic foot, and during a November card at the Sportatorium, he interfered in a match between his brother Kevin and Brian Adias. Adias, who taunted Kerry to enter the ring, was discus-punched out of the ring by Kerry, and then later Kerry and Kevin Von Erich drop-kicked manager Percy Pringle out of the ring, which brought the Sportatorium patrons to their feet. Kerry even bodyslammed Ted Arcidi during the post-match brawl.

As the UWF/NWA merger was complete, many top names returned to World Class, including Buddy Roberts, Terry Gordy, The Angel of Death Iceman King Parsons, Jason Sterling, and Jeff Raitz. The Iron Sheik also joined the organization later on. Upon Ken Mantell&#x27;s return, WCCW held its final &quot;Christmas Day Star Wars&quot; show, during which one of the most infamous incidents in Texas wrestling history — known to wrestling purists as the &quot;Christmas Day Massacre&quot; — occurred. WCWA champion Al Perez and Kerry Von Erich were scheduled to face each other in a steel cage main event for the title, with Gary Hart handcuffed to Fritz to prevent interference. However, before the match began, Terry Gordy ran in and made disparaging remarks about Kerry and his motorcycle accident, which started a fight. Buddy Roberts, Iceman King Parsons and the late Angel of Death stormed the ring and handcuffed Fritz to the cage, delivering a furious beating while Kerry was being ganged up by Gordy. Eventually Kevin stormed the ring to save both Kerry and Fritz. After the attack, Fritz — who was normally seen walking away from vicious attacks under his own power — was assisted out of the ring by Kerry and Kevin. Upon leaving the ring, Fritz staged a seizure by self-collapsing onto the floor of Reunion Arena, and was supposedly rushed to a hospital; local news media reported this as a top story, not realizing until later that the entire incident had been a work. Kerry, after an hour or so, returned to the ring to face Perez but lost the match due to outside interference from Hart. The next day on Championship Sports, announcer Marc Lowrance recapped the incident throughout the course of the two-hour program.

Afterwards, World Class promoted the renewed Freebird-Von Erich rivalry pitting Terry Gordy, Buddy Roberts, King Parsons and The Angel of Death against Kevin and Kerry Von Erich and Chris Adams, with Steve or Shaun Simpson also helping to even the odds. The unusual twist of this feud was the absence of Michael Hayes, who was still in the NWA, but would eventually return to World Class, as a face, wrestling alongside the Von Erichs, starting a civil war between Hayes, Roberts and Gordy. Gordy would eventually join Hayes and the Von Erichs later on, but this occurred only weeks before the angle ran its course.

One high mark in this renewed rivalry was a February 1988 country-whipping match between Kevin and Kerry against Gordy and Roberts. Iceman King Parsons and Chris Adams got involved in the match, and eventually turned into a six-man brawl. David Sheldon, aka The Angel of Death, also got involved, and orchestrated a four-on-two gangup on both Kerry and Adams with Kevin handcuffed to the ring rope. Kevin managed to escape and chase Sheldon, Roberts, Gordy and Parsons away.

Another was a planned match between Adams against Parsons, with Kevin and Gordy seconding their respective partners. This event, which occurred three weeks after the Christmas Day Massacre of 1987, turned into a four-on-two brawl, and eventually erupted into a battle royale. Announcer Marc Lowrance exclaimed during the brawl that 20 men were coming into the ring, which proved to be true as wrestlers from the back tried to end the carnage.

====1988====
Another hot feud taking place during this period was Chris Adams against both Terry Taylor and Iceman King Parsons, both of whom were brought into WCCW by Mantell. Parsons and Adams resumed their feud that began in the UWF, while Taylor came in during late-January 1988, duping everyone into believing that he was a changed wrestler and wanted to tag-team with Adams again, after a violent feud of their own. This led to a February 12, 1988 angle at the Sportatorium in which Taylor was to have faced Al Perez for the WCWA World title. Adams came in wondering what Taylor was doing in World Class, and then later went on a tirade against Perez, demanding a title shot. Terry Gordy later came in and began fighting with Adams, with Kerry Von Erich running in to battle Perez and Gordy. Taylor, who did not get involved in the carnage, then sucker-punched Adams and broke his left hand with two piledrivers, as Von Erich and Gordy were fighting up the aisle. Adams missed about a month of wrestling as a result, returning with a bandaged left hand. The card itself, which featured the infamous country-whipping match, had at least a half-dozen piledrivers performed in the ring; including two by Taylor on Adams, another by Gordy on Kevin Von Erich, and two from Kerry – one on Gordy and another on Roberts. In another strange angle, Adams wrestled Taylor while wearing a catcher&#x27;s mask in Fort Worth, in order to protect Chris from legit injuries he sustained during an earlier match in Missouri. Adams lost that match by DQ when he hit Taylor with the mask. In another contest, Adams won by DQ when Taylor brought Mike George and Masahiro Chono in a three-on-one gangup.

Meanwhile, Kerry Von Erich won the World Class title from Perez; and lost it to Iceman Parsons following an infamous incident during a March 1988 card in which the lights at the Sportatorium went out during the match, and when the lights returned, Kerry was down on the mat, with Parsons pinning him. Michael Hayes, who was fighting outside the ring with Buddy Roberts, was also down outside the ring. Many wrestlers believed at one time that Kevin Vaughn, formerly Lance Von Erich, was responsible for the lights being turned off which resulted in the unknown attack on both Hayes and Kerry. Kerry regained the championship the following May at the final Texas Stadium Parade of Champions card.

By May 1988, World Class and the Memphis-based CWA began a working agreement with Renegades Rampage, allowing wrestlers from both organizations to appear either in Dallas or in the Memphis area. Jerry Lawler entered the Sportatorium ring for the first time in late-May and faced Kerry Von Erich for the first time. This bout never took place, as Lawler sucker-punched Kerry in the ring, resulting in Kerry being taken out on a stretcher. Adams and Taylor took their angle to Memphis and competed against each other several times at the Mid-South Coliseum.

In the summer of 1988, the major storyline pitted Michael Hayes and Steve Cox against the Samoan Swat Team, managed by Buddy Roberts; along with a series of bouts between Jerry Lawler and Kerry Von Erich over the World Class and AWA titles. Chris Adams, Terry Gordy and Terry Taylor all left World Class at that time (Adams, who was also a promoter under the L&amp;A Promotions banner, would eventually return towards the end of the year, as a wrestler and trainer). Gary Hart also left World Class during this time, and would not return to Dallas again until 1991 under the Global Wrestling Federation banner. Hart&#x27;s decision to leave World Class (other than being under contract with the NWA) was mostly due to his concern that the promotion he, Mercer and Grant help build in a time span of eight years, would go out of business. World Class would in fact be defunct two years later. Hart mentioned this in the &quot;Heroes of World Class&quot; DVD documentary, as well as not liking the idea of Ken Mantell buying a portion of the company, which he also revealed on the Triumph and Tragedy of WCCW DVD.

===Pro Wrestling USA (1987–1988)===
Several unsuccessful attempts had been made in 1987–88 to take World Class national; among them was a sparsely-attended &quot;Von Erichs over America&quot; tour, and a merger between World Class, the AWA and CWA the following year. A major pay-per-view card, AWA SuperClash III, was held in Chicago in December 1988, featuring a world title unification match in which Jerry Lawler defeated Kerry Von Erich. However, SuperClash III was not a hit, and Pro Wrestling USA was dissolved.

===Final days of the WCCW (1989–1990)===
After SuperClash III, Ken Mantell and Fritz Von Erich sold WCCW to CWA owner Jerry Jarrett. According to Skandor Akbar, Jarrett got sued by Kevin, although his brother Kerry welcomed Jarrett to the promotion. The combined federation became known as the USWA, originally called the United States Wrestling Alliance. Jarrett would run the new USWA out of two headquarters: one in Dallas (the weekly shows in Fort Worth being discontinued at this point, however several Fort Worth cards were still held), the other in Memphis. The deal made Jarrett 60 percent owner of World Class, with Kevin and Kerry Von Erich being 40 percent owners.

In addition, the Sportatorium began to run free wrestling tapings for its &quot;Championship Sports&quot; broadcast on KTVT and for several months on its &quot;Wild West Wrestling&quot; program, which in some markets accompanied its &quot;World Class Championship Wrestling&quot; broadcasts, featuring its top stars wrestling preliminary wrestlers and up-and-coming stars, very similar to the Memphis Wrestling programs seen there. These broadcasts lasted until August 1990. A few markets, including Las Vegas, included a three-hour block of wrestling from the USWA promotion (two hours from Dallas and one hour from the Memphis&#x27; CWA promotion). John Keaton left the promotion soon afterwards and was replaced by former Wild West Wrestling referee Harold Harris.

Following the merger of World Class with the CWA and AWA, the promotion originally developed an angle pitting wrestlers from Texas against wrestlers from Tennessee. This would eventually evolve into a new angle that would bring a return to sellout crowds to the Sportatorium for the first time in over six months: Eric Embry against Devastation Inc.

Embry, who became the promotion&#x27;s booker and lead babyface, was originally offered a contract by Skandor Akbar to join Devastation Inc., which he refused to join. This resulted in several gangups on Embry by his stable, including Cactus Jack Manson, King Parsons and Gary Young. Jeff Jarrett, who was feuding with Embry over the World Class light heavyweight title, joined Embry&#x27;s side and helped out fight off Akbar&#x27;s Army, with Brickhouse Brown and later Chris Adams (returning to World Class after a six-month hiatus) getting involved. On two occasions, Embry duped Akbar, who referred to Embry as &quot;the flamboyant piece of trash&quot;, into signing a contract to join Devastation Inc., once in which he took his $5,000 cash bonus and decked Akbar after quitting; and again when Embry and Akbar signed a document which was revealed by matchmaker Frank Dusek to be a wrestling match between the two. The popularity of Embry reached its high point when he lost a loser leaves town match to Gary Young, due to outside interference by Cactus Jack Manson. This prompted the return of Percy Pringle to the promotion, who would later campaign to bring Embry back to World Class, as well as being the victim of several attacks by Akbar and his troops. The campaign led to Embry&#x27;s reinstatement to World Class, but it would cause Dusek to be temporarily suspended by WCCW Board Member Elmore Hayes.

Among the famous incidents that occurred during this angle include Embry being hit with a baseball bat by Akbar, Cactus Jack and Gary Young (in a mask as &quot;The Zodiac&quot;) during an April 1989 battle against Akbar; both of whom were hiding under the Sportatorium ring for some three hours. Frank Dusek, who served as the special referee, was also lit up with the baseball bat and piledriven by Young during the melee. Afterwards, Embry induced vomiting in the ring (which was censored on television). Prior to that, another infamous angle occurred when Embry, who was a special referee in a match between Kerry Von Erich and Gary Young, was fighting with Akbar. The battle carried out into the Sportatorium parking lot, when a hand came through the fire door to kidnap Embry (later revealed to be Killer Tim Brooks). Chris Adams, Kerry Von Erich and Jimmy Jack Funk then carried a bloodied Embry out of the parking lot back into the arena following that vicious attack.

Another angle involved the late referee Harold Harris. Harris, who was using a British accent to make people believe he was from England (prompting Frank Dusek to say that if Harris was from England, then Chris Adams was Paul McCartney), drew controversy for favoring the heels, and on a few occasions, like the WWE&#x27;s Danny Davis and the NWA&#x27;s Teddy Long, Harris would execute fast three-counts on the heels and slow three-counts on the babyfaces. During one infamous incident, Embry piledrived Harris as he was attempting to get a spot as a referee in some matches. Harris was eventually &quot;fired&quot; by matchmaker Frank Dusek following a controversial Texas heavyweight title match in which Gary Young, dressed as &quot;The Super Zodiac,&quot; defeated Eric Embry for the title, when Young grabbed a chain from the pocket of Harris (who took a bump by Embry) and blasted Embry for the win.

Shortly afterwards, during an interview segment in which Akbar introduced Harris as the &quot;sergeant of arms&quot; of Devastation Inc, Harris, Iceman King Parsons, Brickhouse Brown, Gary Young, Cactus Jack Manson and Skandor Akbar orchestrated a six-on-one gangup on Dusek, with Harris smashing a wooden chair over Dusek&#x27;s head. Marc Lowrance exclaimed the incident as being &quot;absolutely sickening,&quot; then later said that he was told not to use those words. Lowrance, outraged by the incident, later told Akbar to &quot;kiss my ass&quot; as the tag team match between Kerry Von Erich and Jeff Jarrett vs. Mick Foley and Gary Young was about to begin; and even walked away from the broadcast table while Akbar was conducting a tirade of his own. Foley and Young won the match, again due to interference by Akbar. Tojo Yamamoto was then introduced as the &quot;President of World Class,&quot; who drew the ire of the fans due to his lack of action for the Dusek incident(Even putting the blame on Dusek himself for firing Harris in the first place), then later getting involved in several altercations with various wrestlers, including a vicious attack against Dusek in an empty Sportatorium, resulting in Dusek&#x27;s left arm being in a cast. Lowrance was also physically restrained by P.Y. Chu-Hi (Phil Hickerson) as manager Tojo Yamamoto berated Lowrance, after Lowrance called Yamamoto a liar and having no respect for him. Embry came out to save Lowrance from any further harm. Prior to that, Lowrance was involved in an heated confrontation against Yamamoto, including one instance in which he started off by calling Yamamoto &quot;a disgrace to wrestling and to himself.&quot;, which led to Yamamoto angrily grabbing the mic that Lowrance was holding after Lowrance attempted to cut him off. At the end of that interview, an unusually angry Lowrance said &quot;go to black&quot;, signaling for a commercial message.

===The United States Wrestling Association (1989–1990)===
With all of these aforementioned occurrences, everything came down to a battle for control of World Class on August 4, 1989 at the Dallas Sportatorium. Embry wrestled Hickerson in a steel cage match, with the winner gaining control of World Class (Embry representing the USWA, and Hickerson representing WCCW). During the match, Yamamoto shouted instructions at Hickerson, with Lowrance grabbing the mike out of his hands on several occasions. Finally, after a 10-minute battle, Embry managed to avoid a body avalanche from Hickerson and pin him to win, thus officially changing World Class into the USWA. This was necessary in reality because the Adkissons owned the World Class name and would no longer allow Jerry Jarrett to continue using the name any further after this event.

After the match, Embry and manager Percy Pringle walked to the D section of the Sportatorium and tore the World Class Championship Wrestling banner off of the wall (in the same spot where the American flag once was displayed). Various wrestlers such as Matt Borne then stomped and spit on it. Lowrance and Chris Adams, who celebrated Embry&#x27;s victory in the ring, did not partake in the post-match festivities, showing respect to the Adkissons and the World Class name, and neither Kevin nor Kerry were on hand during the celebration. Other World Class banners, all owned by the Adkisson family, above the Sportatorium were later removed, replaced with various World flags. The red World Class ring aprons were covered by the Renegades Rampage logo except for one section of the ring, but all of the aprons would be replaced as well as the ring itself.

The Dallas Sportatorium was refurbished with a new ring, and ring aprons with the &quot;Renegades Rampage&quot; logo. Section D also had a large yellow banner promoting Renegades, which did not sit well with some longtime patrons who were more used to the American flag or the World Class banner displayed there. The main camera position was also relocated to the Section D area, and the broadcast table returned to its original position on the southern end of the arena. For a time, a USWA wrestling banner was placed above the Section D sign, but was later moved adjacent to the E and F sections of the Sportatorium, or the east corner of the arena. Its syndicated programs, &quot;World Class Championship Wrestling&quot; and &quot;Wild West Wrestling&quot; were later renamed &quot;USWA Challenge&quot; and &quot;USWA Main Event&quot; respectively. The latter program featured a main event of its Saturday &quot;Championship Sports&quot; program, with the remainder of the program featuring past World Class cards dating as far back as late-1987. These two programs aired in this format until 1991.

Some of the hot feuds of the era included Chris Adams and Toni Adams vs. Phil Hickerson and Tojo Yamamoto; Kerry Von Erich vs. Tarras Bulba (with Kerry being pinned by Bulba&#x27;s iron claw); and Eric Embry vs. Billy Travis. Travis later feuded with Chris Adams, Jeff Jarrett and Kevin Von Erich. Kerry later wrestled against Mark Calaway, who was known as &quot;The Punisher&quot; at that time, while Embry was involved in a &quot;blinding&quot; angle (similar to the angle used with Chris Adams nearly four years before) involving a white bottle (which may have been Freebird Hair Cream) which Travis used against Embry to blind him. In fact, Billy Travis became the Sportatorium&#x27;s biggest heel wrestler who would often sing a line of various songs during ringside interviews, heckle the crowd, and on several occasions smash a wooden guitar over the head of several wrestlers. One notable such incident occurred in October 1989 when he cold-cocked Percy Pringle with a guitar during an interview, then claimed that the guitar was given to him by Mick Jagger. During one incident, Travis spanked Toni Adams in the center of the ring at the Sportatorium, with Chris handcuffed on the ring rope; and in another infamous incident, Travis cold-cocked Adams with a coke bottle over his head, prompting announcer Marc Lowrance to announce that Adams &quot;may be dead&quot;. Chris only received a minor cut on his scalp and returned to wrestle the following day, even disguising himself as another wrestler to gain revenge against Travis.

In December 1989, Adams and Embry began feuding. The angle, developed by Embry and Adams, was brought about when Adams and Embry blamed each other for two significant losses in tag team matches, including one during a tag team tournament between Billy Travis and Gary Young. A few weeks later, a six-man tag match between Adams, Embry and Bill Dundee vs. Travis, Young and Skandor Akbar, was held. After taking punishment for 11 minutes by Young, Travis and Akbar, Adams was thrown out of the ring. Embry and Toni Adams attempted to help Chris, and an argument ensued, which led Embry to shove Toni down to the floor. As Embry attempted to help her back up, Chris attacked him, and a brawl between Adams and Embry ensued. Dundee attempted to help stop the carnage, but was hit by Embry, while Akbar, Young and Travis stood in the ring cheering. The carnage was broken up when wrestlers from the back, including Steve Austin and Matt Borne, came in to help get order restored. Two weeks later, Adams and Embry faced each other in the ring, with the majority of the crowd cheering for Embry in the beginning, and the hint of a possible heel turn by Adams. As the match progressed with no true dominance by either wrestler, Embry hit referee Bronko Lubich during the bout, which resulted in a DQ. As referee Tony Falk came in to stop the fight, Adams hits him, and another brawl between Embry and Adams ensued, with wrestlers again coming out to separate the two. According to Embry, the idea was for Embry to turn heel and start a long feud with Adams, but the crowd would not boo for Embry and turning Adams heel wouldn&#x27;t work either, since he is a beloved figure in the area himself. The angle was short-lived, and Embry left the organization for a while, but returned a few months later and reteamed with Adams and continued his battles with Akbar&#x27;s group until the USWA pulled out of Dallas.

Two major feuds erupted in 1990: one between Chris Adams and &quot;Stunning&quot; Steve Austin, and the other between Kerry Von Erich and Matt Borne. The Adams-Austin feud started slow, but eventually picked up huge heat thanks in part to good promoting by Adams, who decided to bring in former girlfriend Jean Clarke (also known as Jeanie Adams for a time, and later married to Austin) and then-wife Toni Adams into the feud; resulting in a mixed tag-team war very similar to the Adams-Sunshine vs. Garvin-Precious battles of the early 1980s. On a few occasions, Jeanie was spanked by Adams in the center of the ring; and on one interview segment, Clarke and Austin showed pictures of Adams with different women, including a 1986 picture with Sunshine and the World Class belt, and another of Adams and Clarke from his early days in England. The angle, which Adams created and wanted to promote initially in 1986 with Jeanie and the late Gino Hernandez, even gained national headlines, as the National Enquirer ran a story on the Adams-Toni-Jeanie-Austin angle. The climax of the Austin-Adams feud occurred just before the USWA/World Class breakup; when Austin wrestled in a come-as-you-are match, with Austin wearing his football gear from his playing days at UNT, and Adams wearing his Judo gi and using a kendo stick.

The Kerry Von Erich-Matt Borne feud began in May 1990 when Borne turned heel by attacking Chris Von Erich during an interview segment with the soon-to-be departed Marc Lowrance at the Sportatorium. A week or so later, Borne and Von Erich battled in a &quot;pinfall counts anywhere in the building&quot; match, which eventually continued outside the Sportatorium. During the outside confrontation (in a thunderstorm, among other things), Von Erich slammed Borne onto the hood of a parked vehicle and also attempted to attack him with a piece of two-by-four. Minor damage occurred with the vehicles, and the ensuing fight continued until Chris Adams, Jeff Jarrett, and others broke up the brawl. Promoter Max Andrews &quot;suspended&quot; Kerry for his actions, but no time frame was given as to how long he was suspended. This drew the ire of Borne, who demanded the USWA forfeit Kerry&#x27;s Texas heavyweight belt. Instead, Kerry was reinstated days later as the two battled for the belt, which Borne won thanks to interference by Percy Pringle. Pringle joined Borne in his feud with Kerry, until June 1990, when Von Erich left for the WWF. Borne also left a short time later to join that organization as Doink The Clown. Percy later joined Austin and Clarke in their feud with Chris and Toni Adams, with Chris Von Erich and at times Kevin Von Erich getting involved. Borne also had a few matches against Kerry&#x27;s brother Kevin.

Another feud that drew headlines was between &quot;Hollywood&quot; John Tatum and Bill Dundee, with valet Tessa in the middle of the feud. Originally brought in by Tatum, Tessa, like Sunshine years before, turned face and joined Dundee&#x27;s side. During a match against Tatum, Kevin Von Erich, who beat Tatum, swept Tessa off her feet and carried her into the dressing room much to the dismay of Tatum. During a July 1990 match, Tatum knocked Tessa unconscious following a superkick to the head, resulting in Tessa being carried out on a stretcher. In that same event, Toni Adams was carried out on a stretcher following a flying splash from the top rope onto Toni in the ring by Steve Austin, while Toni was on top of her husband Chris, who was piledrived on the concrete floor by Austin earlier, to protect him. These two incidents resulted in a few stations canceling its &quot;USWA&quot; broadcasts due to its violent nature.

During this time, other wrestlers such as Terry Taylor made brief appearances, and future GWF wrestling star Rod Price made his debut by attacking Kerry during an interview segment.

Under Jarrett, World Class/USWA Dallas was finally able to turn itself around financially, and became modestly profitable during the 1989–1990 period. However, because of a revenue dispute with the Adkissons (who still owned 40 percent of the Dallas promotion), Jarrett ultimately pulled the promotion out of Dallas after the September 7, 1990 card. A week before Jarrett&#x27;s departure, KTVT dropped its long-running Saturday night wrestling telecasts; according to some reports, the cancellation was the result of frequent on-air profanity (mostly from Eric Embry), despite multiple warnings from station management, as well as the controversial superkick incident between John Tatum and Tessa.

Kevin Von Erich, without the benefit of television (as the result of KTVT&#x27;s cancellation of Saturday Night&#x27;s &quot;Championship Sports&quot;), the absence of his brother Kerry, and longtime World Class guru Gary Hart (who was starting his Texas Wrestling Federation promotion at the time), began promoting Sportatorium wrestling himself, bringing back the World Class Championship Wrestling name on September 14, 1990. Longtime World Class mainstays Chris Adams, King Parsons, Kevin&#x27;s brother Chris Von Erich, Percy Pringle, John Tatum, David Sheldon, Steve Austin, Jeanie Clarke and Toni Adams remained, while wrestlers associated with the Memphis end of the USWA left. Steve Simpson and Brian Adias also returned to the promotion, with a few appearances by former WCCW referee David Manning. Initially, the return of World Class proved to be a modest success (which included the return of ring announcer Marc Lowrance and a few appearances by Bill Mercer), but financial sources ran out quickly and attendance at the Sportatorium dropped considerably to sometimes fewer than 500. As a result, on November 23, 1990, Von Erich held its last World Class Championship Wrestling show at the Sportatorium, which featured Kevin winning the Texas heavyweight championship from The Angel of Death in the show&#x27;s final match. After that match, referee Bronko Lubich announced his retirement from the sport. Lubich would return a few times as a special referee afterwards in the Global Wrestling Federation, with his last appearance in 1994. A month later, the USWA returned to the Sportatorium, but only for a limited basis, as promoters Max Andrews, Joe Pedicino, and Boni Blackstone were getting their Global Wrestling Federation promotion ready to go for the summer of 1991. WCCW veterans went on to compete in other promotions, including Gary Hart&#x27;s Texas Wrestling Federation group in North Dallas.

=== Legacy ===
Several attempts to revive WCCW since then have been modest at best: in 1991, Kevin Von Erich began a working agreement with Boston-based International Championship Wrestling, which renamed itself International World Class Championship Wrestling. During that brief time in IWCCW, Kevin had a legendary interview in which Tony Rumble, aka The Boston Bad Boy, made derogatory remarks about Kevin and his brothers, after which Kevin ran Rumble out of the interview studio. The following year, Kevin began promoting a few scattered cards under the WCCW banner (featuring Kerry, who had been released from the WWF, and Chris Adams). Finally, in 1997, Gary Hart – with no participation by either Kevin or Fritz—launched a World Class-in-name-only independent promotion at the Sportatorium. This organization, known as &quot;World Class II: The Next Generation&quot;, featured only a few of the surviving wrestlers from the original WCCW group (most notably Chris Adams, Iceman Parsons and Maniac Mike Davis), as well as Gary&#x27;s son, Chad Hart; it folded in less than a year. That promotion was also co-owned by Bill Mercer and Mickey Grant, and some believe that Adams was also a silent partner in World Class II. Adams, Mike Davis and Terry Gordy died in 2001, and the Sportatorium, which stood since 1934, was demolished in 2003, but not before Kevin Von Erich toured the damaged arena for the last time, along with filmmaker Brian Harrison. In 2008, Gary Hart died from a heart attack shortly after returning home from an shoot interview. Two years later, Skandor Akbar and Toni Adams had died, and in 2013, Percy Pringle, who was one of the last surviving heel managers in World Class, passed.

Kevin Von Erich released a compilation DVD of classic Von Erichs matches in 2004. Rumors of an impending WWE buyout of the WCCW syndicated broadcast video library began to spread on internet message boards the following year, and on June 5, 2006, the company issued a press release announcing that the purchase had been finalized. Footage from KTVT&#x27;s &quot;Championship Sports&quot; telecasts was not included in the buyout and is not owned by the WWE. WWE released a DVD titled &quot;The Triumph and Tragedy of World Class Championship Wrestling&quot; on December 11, 2007. A documentary by Chicago filmmaker Brian Harrison on WCCW and the Von Erichs, &quot;Heroes of World Class&quot;, was released on DVD on June 15, 2006, to rave reviews from fans and critics alike. An updated &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; DVD of &quot;Heroes of World Class&quot;, 30 minutes longer than the original, was released in December 2006. The documentary featured interviews from several of the key figures in World Class, including Kevin, Mercer, Grant, Hart, Adams, Skandor Akbar, Marc Lowrance, David Manning and Johnny Mantell. On February 14, 2007, WWE 24/7 debuted WCCW on WWE 24/7 hosted by Kevin Von Erich and Michael Hayes.

In 2009, the entire Von Erich family was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. World Class&#x27; two major venues, Reunion Arena and Texas Stadium, were demolished soon thereafter. Reunion Arena was imploded on November 17, 2009, while Texas Stadium saw the same fate nearly five months later, on April 11, 2010.

In May 2018, Imperial Wrestling Revolution, an Oklahoma-based independent wrestling promotion, announced they had changed their name to World Class Revolution in honor of World Class Championship Wrestling, with the blessing of Kevin Von Erich and the Von Erich family.

A 2023 sports drama film, &quot;The Iron Claw&quot;, produced by A24 chronicles the history of the Von Erich family and World Class&#x27; history as a whole. The film is directed by Sean Durkin, the film stars Zac Efron, Lily James, Jeremy Allen White, Harris Dickinson, Maura Tierney, Maxwell Jacob Friedman, Chavo Guerrero Jr. and Holt McCallany.

==Programming==
Weekly wrestling shows were staged there on Tuesday nights until August 1978, then were moved to Sunday nights until the early &#x27;80s, and finally were held on Friday nights until the promotion&#x27;s demise. In the early 1980s, WCCW began its hour-long weekly syndicated television show which introduced numerous innovative production techniques, many of which are still commonly used today. The promotion was also the first to use familiar rock songs as entrance music for its wrestlers. The show was syndicated across the United States, and at one point arguably scored higher ratings than &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

By the fall of 1983, the opening sequence of World Class&#x27; syndicated broadcasts began with a NASA photo of Earth, taken during the Apollo 16 mission back in 1972. An animated satellite would beam down over Dallas, and as it moves east, the World Class logo would appear and move across to the upper left hand corner of the picture. Two more satellite beams aired two highlights from World Class: one involving a match between Kerry Von Erich and Michael Hayes, and another between David Von Erich and Jimmy Garvin. Another opening sequence featured one segment with Kevin Von Erich performing a flying splash onto Terry Gordy, and another with Michael Hayes attacking Kerry Von Erich, who was handcuffed onto a ring rope. In late 1984, a different World Class logo was used and two different match sequences: one involving Skandor Akbar urging The Missing Link to head-butt Kerry Von Erich; while the other scene was Kerry Von Erich slamming Kamala to the mat, with his handler Friday outside the ring moving his fist down in disgust, with announcers Marc Lowrance and Ralph Pulley watching. This opening sequence would be used again in 1991 with Boston-based International World Class Championship Wrestling. By 1987, the opening sequence changed; beginning with a dusk photo of Dallas, and other shots of the city, including the Dallas North Tollway, before the World Class logo would appear; then scenes of past wrestling events (mostly from the 1987 Texas Stadium event) would follow before the logo reappeared again.

WCCW&#x27;s syndicated show was usually taped at the Sportatorium beginning in 1981, with two hour-long shows being recorded every other Friday. These telecasts were, in the beginning, seen in only a few markets and were hosted at various times by Gene Goodson, Steve Harms, and Marc Lowrance; when the show was taken over in 1982 by Continental Productions and went to international syndication, well-known north Texas journalist/sportscaster Bill Mercer (a former play-by-play announcer for the Dallas Cowboys, Texas Rangers and Chicago White Sox along with other Texas-based teams) became the ringside announcer at the Sportatorium. For a few months he co-hosted with Jay Saldi, and by 1983, hosted the hour-long program alone, with Lowrance filling in for Mercer from time to time. After Mercer left in 1987 to join Ken Mantell&#x27;s Wild West Wrestling promotion, Lowrance returned to the broadcast position, where he would remain until resigning to become a minister in July 1990. Lowrance would later be paired by former wrestler-turned-matchmaker Frank Dusek for one year, then later by &quot;The Beauty&quot; Terrance Garvin. Lowrance left World Class/USWA in May 1990 to become a full-time Methodist minister, after nearly 10 years with the organization. Craig Johnson replaced Lowrance for the final two months of telecasts, due to the unavailability of Bill Mercer, who was a ringside announcer for Gary Hart&#x27;s wrestling promotion at the Metroplex Arena. Percy Pringle III would replace Garvin, who returned to the wrestling ring. Horton eventually went on to host the USWA and GWF telecasts in later years, and Pringle went on to greater fame in the WWF/WWE as Paul Bearer, the manager of The Undertaker. Lowrance did return to the Sportatorium as ring announcer in September 1990 (as did Mercer, who filled in for Lowrance on a few cards), when World Class seceded from the USWA, and appeared occasionally during the 1990s in other Dallas-based promotions such as the Global Wrestling Federation. Lowrance is no longer in the business, but does appear at vintage pro wrestling conventions on occasion.

The promotion also held matches on Monday nights in Fort Worth at the North Side Coliseum (an indoor rodeo arena, known today as the Cowtown Coliseum), until the mid-1970s, then relocated to the Will Rogers Memorial Center, where it remained until WCCW discontinued its regular Fort Worth shows in 1988, although the promotion did promote Fort Worth house cards on occasion until 1989. These matches aired Saturday nights on local station KTVT, as a 90-minute broadcast entitled &quot;Saturday Night Wrestling&quot;, which was expanded to two hours in November 1983 and retitled &quot;Championship Sports&quot;. From late 1988 until the station cancelled wrestling in 1990, KTVT&#x27;s tapings were held at the Sportatorium on Saturday mornings. Dan Coats, who had served as ring announcer in Fort Worth for many years prior to the Von Erich era, called the action on KTVT from 1966 until 1976, when Bill Mercer was brought in to replace him. When Mercer moved to the syndicated telecasts, Marc Lowrance took over the KTVT show. As he would with the syndicated series, Jon Horton became host of &quot;Championship Sports&quot; for its last few episodes.

===Announcers===
Lowrance was also the ring announcer at the Sportatorium for several years before moving to TV full-time; he was originally hired in 1980 to replace Boyd Pierce, who had been with the group since the 1960s and left to join Bill Watts&#x27; Mid-South Wrestling promotion. Other ring announcers in WCCW included George Preston (1960s), Joe Rinelli (from the 1960s until 1988) and Ralph Pulley (mid-1980s), who also served as a referee for a time. Lowrance, who was 21 at the time, was originally hired for a three-week stint until a permanent replacement was found for Pierce. Soon after, when no one was found, Lowrance&#x27;s stay with World Class became permanent. Doyle King, and for one week Jim Ross, worked as fill-in announcers for Lowrance for the Fort Worth telecasts. In 1981, Dallas rock &#x27;n roll singer Gene Summers took over the ring announcing duties for both the Dallas and Fort Worth matches. However, his tenure was cut short due to conflicting European music tours. It was during this time period that he released the now famous recording &quot;Ballad of Moon Dog Mayne&quot; under the pseudonym of Ricky Ringside. Summers&#x27; brief announcing career in 1981 lasted from March 8 to May 31. Marc Lowrance returned to the ring announcing duties in Dallas, and either Ralph Pulley or Joe Rinelli handled the Fort Worth matches.

===Referees===
Lubich was also for a time the head booker. Manning held a full-time position as a teacher and wrestling coach at MacArthur High School in Irving.

<text>Doctor Who, also referred to as Doctor Who: The Movie or as Doctor Who: The Television Movie or Dr Who in America is a 1996 television film continuing the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Developed as a co-production between Universal Studios and BBC Worldwide, it premiered on 12 May 1996 on CITV in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, 15 days before its first showing in the United Kingdom on BBC One and two days before being broadcast in the United States on Fox. It was theatrically released in some countries.

The first attempt to revive &quot;Doctor Who&quot; following its suspension in 1989, it was intended as a backdoor pilot for a new American-produced &quot;Who&quot; TV series. It introduced Paul McGann as the Eighth Doctor in his only televised appearance as the character until &quot;The Night of the Doctor&quot; in 2013 (though McGann has portrayed the Doctor also in various audio productions). It also marks the final appearance of Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor until his cameo appearance in &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot; in 2022, the only appearance of Daphne Ashbrook as companion Grace Holloway, and the only onscreen appearance of Eric Roberts&#x27;s version of The Master, although he has since reprised the role in audio dramas for Big Finish Productions. Although a ratings success in the United Kingdom, the film did not fare well on American television and no series was commissioned. The series was later relaunched on the BBC in 2005. The only &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes between the film and the new series were a 1999 spoof, &quot;Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death&quot;, and a 2003 animation, &quot;Scream of the Shalka&quot;.

Although primarily produced by different entities than the 1963–1989 series and intended for an American audience, the producers chose not to produce a &quot;re-imagining&quot; or &quot;reboot&quot; of the series but rather a continuation of the original narrative. The production was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia and is the only episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; to be filmed in Canada.

==Plot==
The Doctor, currently in his seventh incarnation, transports the Master&#x27;s remains, from Skaro, to Gallifrey via his TARDIS. The Master had been previously tried and executed at the hands of the Daleks. En route, the box with his remains breaks open and the Master in the form of a snake-like ooze leaks out, infecting the TARDIS. The Doctor is forced to make an emergency materialisation in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown on 30 December 1999.

After exiting the TARDIS, the Doctor is shot by a gang chasing down Chang Lee, a young Chinese-American man. Lee calls for an ambulance and escorts the unconscious Doctor to a hospital. The ooze also gets aboard the ambulance. At the hospital, after the bullets are removed, cardiologist Dr. Grace Holloway attempts surgery to stabilise his unusual heartbeat, but is confused by his strange double-heart anatomy. After the Doctor apparently dies in the operating table, his body is taken to the morgue, and Lee steals his possessions. That night, the Master takes over the body of the ambulance driver, Bruce.

Later, the Doctor regenerates. The new Doctor, suffering amnesia, recognises Holloway, who has resigned from the hospital after the failed operation. He follows her to her car and proves he is the same man she failed to save. Grace takes him home to recover. Now in Bruce&#x27;s body, the Master convinces Lee that the Doctor had stolen his original body and persuades him into opening the TARDIS&#x27; Eye of Harmony, which requires a human retinal scan. When the Eye opens, the Doctor is flooded with memories and realises the Master is searching for him. He warns Grace that while the Eye is opened, the fabric of reality will weaken. Earth will be potentially destroyed by midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve if they cannot close it. To solve this conundrum, he needs an atomic clock, and there is one on display at the San Francisco Institute of Technological Advancement and Research.
Outside, the Doctor and Grace find the ambulance. Stepping from it, the Master and Lee offer them a ride. The Doctor does not immediately recognise the Master, but discovers his true identity en route, and escapes with Grace. The two continue to the Institute, obtain the clock and return to the TARDIS. The Doctor then installs the clock and closes the Eye. However, the damage is so great that he must revert time before the Eye was opened to prevent Earth&#x27;s destruction. As he connects the proper TARDIS circuits to do this, the Master takes control of Grace&#x27;s body, and she strikes the Doctor unconscious.

The Doctor wakes to find himself chained above the Eye, the Master poised to take his remaining regenerations while Lee and Grace watch. The Doctor is able to prove to Lee that the Master lied to him after the Master accidentally reveals that the Doctor&#x27;s body is not his, and he refuses to open the Eye again. Enraged, the Master kills him, forces Grace to open the Eye and begins drawing the Doctor&#x27;s lifeforce. After being released from The Master&#x27;s control, Grace completes the final circuits to put the TARDIS into a time-holding pattern, preventing the destruction. She then goes to free the Doctor. The Master kills her, but this has given enough time for the Doctor to free himself. In the ensuing fight, The Doctor gains the upper hand and pushes the Master into the Eye. The Eye closes and time reverts a few minutes, undoing Lee and Grace&#x27;s deaths.

With no further risk to Earth, the Doctor prepares to leave. Lee returns his possessions, and the Doctor warns him not to be in San Francisco on the next New Year&#x27;s Eve. The Doctor offers Grace the opportunity to travel with him, but she politely refuses, and kisses him goodbye. The Doctor departs alone in his TARDIS.

==Production==

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

===Pre-production===
Producer Philip Segal had been trying for some years to launch a new American-produced series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, but the Fox Network — the only American network that showed any interest — was only prepared to commit to a single telemovie. It was hoped that, should the telemovie be successful, Fox might be persuaded to reconsider a series; however, the telemovie&#x27;s ratings performance in America was not strong enough to hold Fox&#x27;s interest.

The production budget for the movie (as revealed in the book &quot;Doctor Who: Regeneration&quot;) was US$5 million, with the Fox Network spending $2.5 million, BBC Television contributing $300,000, and the remaining $2.2 million split between BBC Worldwide and Universal Television.

===Casting===

Casting sessions took place in March 1994; actors who actually auditioned for the role include Liam Cunningham, Mark McGann, Robert Lindsay, Tim McInnerny, Nathaniel Parker, Peter Woodward, John Sessions, Anthony Head, and Tony Slattery. Paul McGann was first considered around the time of these auditions, but did not formally audition for the part until later.

Among the actors who were invited to audition for the role of the Doctor but declined the opportunity were Christopher Eccleston and Peter Capaldi. Eccleston and Capaldi later played the Ninth and Twelfth incarnations of the Doctor, respectively, in the revived series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; which began in 2005. Eccleston turned down the offer to audition for the TV Movie because, at the time, he felt he did not want to be associated with a &quot;brand name&quot; so early in his career. Capaldi declined because he felt it was unlikely that he would be given the part.

Of those actors who originally auditioned for the role of the Doctor, a number guest-starred in the series when it returned from 2005:
* Anthony Head guest-starred in the Series 2 episode &quot;School Reunion&quot; as Mr. Finch.
* Tim McInnerny guest-starred in the Series 4 episode &quot;Planet of the Ood&quot; as Klineman Halpen.
* Liam Cunningham guest-starred in the Series 7 episode &quot;Cold War&quot; as Captain Zhukov.
* John Sessions guest-starred in the Series 8 episode &quot;Mummy on the Orient Express&quot; as the voice of the homicidal computer GUS.

===Production===
The movie was filmed on 35mm film in Vancouver, British Columbia, the first time any &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story had been filmed in North America.

In the 2005 &quot;Doctor Who Confidential&quot; episode &quot;Weird Science&quot;, and on the DVD commentary, Sylvester McCoy reveals that during the sequence where he locks the casket with his sonic screwdriver, he held the tool pointing the wrong way around (although in the original series, it is seen being used both ways). The sonic screwdriver was blurred in post-production to conceal the error.

===Post-production===
The opening pre-credits sequence went through a number of modifications, with several different voice-overs recorded. At one stage the voice-over was to be made by the old Master, played by Gordon Tipple; in the end this was not used. Tipple is still credited as &quot;The Old Master&quot;, though in the final edit his appearance is very brief, stationary, and mute. Had the original pre-titles voice-over been used, it would have been unclear what incarnation of the Doctor Sylvester McCoy portrays in the movie (as he is simply credited as &quot;The Old Doctor&quot;). Only the rewritten narration (as read by Paul McGann) makes his number of regenerations clear. The sequence of the TARDIS flying through the time vortex was briefly reused in the opening of &quot;Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death&quot;, as the Master observes Rowan Atkinson&#x27;s Doctor.

Instead of designing a new &quot;Doctor Who&quot; logo for this film, it was decided instead to use a modified version of the logo that was used for the Jon Pertwee era of the original series (with the exception of the final season). This logo, being the last logo used on an &quot;official&quot; Doctor Who broadcast before the 2005 revival, was, until 2018, used by the BBC for most &quot;Doctor Who&quot; merchandise relating to the first eight Doctors. In 2018, efforts were made to make the show&#x27;s merchandise more uniform, and so most items of merchandise began to use the logo designed for Jodie Whittaker&#x27;s time as the Doctor, abandoning the &quot;Movie&quot; logo for the first time in 22 years.

John Debney was commissioned to write the score for this film, and intended to replace Ron Grainer&#x27;s original theme with a new composition. Ultimately Debney did in fact use an arrangement of Grainer&#x27;s music for the theme, although Grainer goes uncredited.

=== Alternative titles and labelling ===
Both DVD releases are labelled &quot;Doctor Who: The Movie&quot;. The VHS release contains both the name &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and the phrase &quot;The Sensational Feature Length Film&quot; (plausibly read as a subtitle). The novelisation was labelled simply &quot;The Novel of the Film&quot;. The 2021 &quot;Target Collection&quot; reissue of the novelisation is titled &quot;The TV Movie&quot;. The most common fan usage appears to refer to it as &quot;The TV Movie&quot; or &quot;TVM&quot;, or variations thereof.

Upon translation into French, this film was renamed &quot;Le Seigneur du Temps&quot; (literal translation: &quot;The Lord of Time&quot;).

&quot;TVM&quot; is the production code used in the BBC&#x27;s online episode guide. The actual code used during production is 50/LDX071Y/01X. &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;″s &quot;Complete Eighth Doctor Special&quot; gives the production code as #83705. Big Finish Productions uses the code 8A, and numbers its subsequent Eighth Doctor stories correspondingly.

==Broadcast and reception==
The movie premiered in Canada, on the Edmonton, Alberta CITV-TV station on 12 May 1996, two days prior to its Fox Network broadcast.

Commercials on the Fox network advertising the film used special effects footage from the 1986 story &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot;, although this footage was not used in the movie. This marked the first time that footage from the original BBC series had been shown on a major American network. The advertisements also used a different arrangement of the Doctor Who theme music from that heard in the film.

The movie received disappointing US ratings. It received 5.6 million viewers, a total 9% share of the audience.

Maureen Paton in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; praised the movie &quot;At last we have a grown-up hi-tech Doctor Who in Paul McGann...only a low-tech Luddite would miss the endearing amateurism of the old teatime serial format...the makers would be mad not to pursue the option of a series.&quot; Matthew Bond of &quot;The Times&quot;, by contrast stated &quot;If the series is to return it will need stronger scripts than this simplistic offering, which struggled to fill eighty-five minutes and laboured somewhat in its search for wit&quot;. The letters pages of the &quot;Radio Times&quot; were divided between viewers who liked and disliked the TVM. Discussing the TVM, writer Gary Gillatt criticised it for having &quot;too many unnecessary references&quot; to the show&#x27;s backstory. Gillatt added &quot;although very entertaining, stylishly directed and perfectly played, the TV movie perhaps tried a little too hard to be what &quot;Doctor Who&quot; once was, rather than crusading to demonstrate what it could be in the future&quot;.

===Awards===
&quot;Doctor Who: The Television Movie&quot; won the 1996 Saturn Award for Best Television Presentation.

==Commercial releases==
===Home media===

A Laserdisc release of the movie was released exclusively in Hong Kong by Universal in 1997.

The unedited version was released on DVD in the UK in 2001 titled as &quot;Doctor Who: The Movie&quot;, and was re-released in 2007 as a limited edition with an alternative cover sleeve (but with no change in content) as part of a series of classic series re-releases aimed at attracting fans of the revived series to the older shows.

Both the edited and unedited versions have also been released in countries such as Australia and New Zealand.

The 2010 DVD box set &quot;Revisitations&quot; contains the movie with new, updated Special Edition DVD features. It included a new commentary with Paul McGann and Sylvester McCoy, an hour-long documentary on the time in between the film and the series&#x27; cancellation in 1989, a documentary on the 7 years it took to get the film made, a documentary on the 8th Doctor&#x27;s comic strip adventures, a documentary on the media reaction to the 8th Doctor, a documentary on the ties between &quot;Blue Peter&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as well as all of the original features, including the original commentary with Geoffrey Sax.

Due to complex licensing issues, no VHS release of the film occurred in North America, and for more than a decade no DVD release occurred, either. Finally, on 25 August 2010, Dan Hall of 2entertain confirmed that the 2010 updated version would be released in North America sometime in the next twelve months following extensive negotiations with Universal Studios. Two months afterward, a North American DVD release date for the 2-disc &quot;Doctor Who: The Movie – Special Edition&quot; was announced to be 8 February 2011.

In 2013 it was released on DVD again as part of the &quot;Doctor Who: The Doctors Revisited 5–8&quot; box set, alongside the classic serials &quot;Earthshock&quot;, &quot;Vengeance on Varos&quot;, and &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot;. Alongside a documentary on the Eighth Doctor, it also features an introduction from then current show runner Steven Moffat. This was also released in North America.

The movie was released as a 2-disc Blu-ray set in Region 2 on 19 September 2016. The footage was not re-scanned from the original film negatives. Instead it is a 1080/50i upscale which suffered from the same PAL speedup issue as previous home media releases.

Music from the movie was on a promotional-only soundtrack album published by the composer, John Debney. Additional music was contributed by John Sponsler and Louis Febre. Although the composer of the Doctor Who Theme, Ron Grainer, did not receive screen credit for his composition in the TV movie broadcast, the CD finally attributes the proper credit on its cover. The entire score was re-released with previously unreleased cues as the eighth disc of the eleven disc &quot;Doctor Who: The 50th Anniversary Collection&quot; on 29 September 2014.

===In print===
The television movie was novelised by Gary Russell and published by BBC Books 15 May 1996. It was the first novelisation of a televised &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story to not be published by Target Books (or related companies) since &quot;Doctor Who and the Crusaders&quot; in 1966.

Basing the adaptation on an early draft of the script, Russell adjusted some details to make it more consistent with the original series, and the novelisation also contains elements that were cut from the shooting script for timing reasons.
* The novel begins with the Seventh Doctor receiving a telepathic summons from the Master (similar to &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot;) to collect his remains from Skaro and a short prologue detailing how the Doctor escapes from the planet with the casket. This was originally intended to be a pre-credits sequence in the movie, and was subsequently contradicted by the ending of the novel &quot;Lungbarrow&quot;, where Romana gives the Seventh Doctor the assignment to retrieve the Master&#x27;s remains.
* More detail is given to Chang Lee and Grace&#x27;s backstory, including his recruitment into the Triads and his seeking a father figure as well as flashbacks to Grace&#x27;s childhood.
* The Eighth Doctor finds the Seventh Doctor&#x27;s clothing in the hospital rather than the Fourth Doctor&#x27;s scarf. Also, the sequence where Chang Lee and the Master see the Seventh Doctor in the Eye of Harmony features all the previous Doctors as originally drafted.
* The scene where the Doctor and Grace meet the motorcycle police officer is relocated to a traffic jam on the Golden Gate Bridge (impossible to film in the movie since it was shot on location in Vancouver).
* When the Doctor first kisses Grace, he immediately pulls back, grins apologetically and murmurs, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, don&#x27;t know what came over me there.&quot; This makes the romantic nature of the kiss more ambiguous. Instead of the second kiss at the end, he gives her the Seventh Doctor&#x27;s straw hat as a memento.
* The Doctor is still referred to as half-human, to which the Master comments, &quot;The Doctor once claimed to be more than just a Time Lord — He should really have said &quot;less&quot; than a Time Lord!&quot; This was a reference to a line cut from &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot;.
* Instead of dying and being brought back to life, Grace and Lee are merely rendered unconscious, though aware of what is happening around them. Russell also spends some time showing the Doctor and them discussing what a &quot;temporal orbit&quot; is.

The novelisation was the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel published by BBC Books. The book was actually published prior to the conclusion of Virgin Books&#x27; contract for publishing original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fiction, so the next release by BBC Books did not occur for about a year when the Eighth Doctor Adventures series began with &quot;The Eight Doctors&quot;. The novelisation was released as a standalone work and is not considered part of this series. The Eighth Doctor Adventures series ran until 2005 when it was discontinued.

The novel was also released as an audio book on 2 June 1997, read by Paul McGann. This reading was later included on the 2004 MP3 CD &quot;Tales from the TARDIS Volume Two&quot;. A revised Target Books edition titled &quot;The TV Movie&quot; was published in paperback and as an audiobook 11 March 2021.

== Continuations ==
* Paul McGann made a reappearance as the Eighth Doctor in the 2013 mini-episode &quot;The Night of the Doctor&quot; in which his regeneration was finally explored.
* Eric Roberts reprised the role of the Master in many Big Finish audio plays: Series 5 of &quot;The Diary of River Song&quot;, Volume 4 of &quot;Doctor Who: Ravenous&quot;, and reprised the role again in &quot;Masterful&quot;, a special release celebrating 50 Years since the Master first appeared in &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot; back in 1971. Roberts reprised the role of his incarnation of the Master in &quot;Master!&quot; two months after the release of &quot;Masterful&quot;. The box set also starred Chase Masterson as Vienna Salvatorri. Roberts even recorded live-action material of himself playing the Master for the &quot;Big Finish&quot; YouTube channel.
* Yee Jee Tso returned in 2002 to play Major Jal Brant in the Seventh Doctor audio drama &quot;Excelis Decays&quot; and Doctor Reece Goddard in the Sixth Doctor webcast &quot;Real Time&quot;.
* Daphne Ashbrook returned in 2004, alongside Paul McGann, as Perfection in the audio drama &quot;The Next Life&quot;.
* Tso and Ashbrook returned to Big Finish together playing Captain Ruth Matheson and Warrant Officer Charlie Sato of UNIT in the audio dramas &quot;Tales From The Vault&quot; and &quot;Mastermind&quot;, both part of the Companions Chronicles series, in 2011 and 2013.

<doc id="471759" wikidata="Q918860" url="?curid=471759" title="Conservative Party of British Columbia">
<text>The Conservative Party of British Columbia, commonly known as the BC Conservatives and colloquially known as the Tories, is a provincial political party in British Columbia, Canada. It is the main rival to the governing British Columbia New Democratic Party and forms the Official Opposition in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. It is led by John Rustad, who was originally elected as a British Columbia Liberal Party MLA in 2005 before being expelled from the Liberal caucus in 2022.

In the first half of the 20th century, the Conservatives competed with the BC Liberal Party for power in the province. During this period, three party leaders served as premier of British Columbia: Richard McBride (1903–1915), William John Bowser (1915–1916), and Simon Fraser Tolmie (1928–1933). Royal Maitland and Herbert Anscomb served as deputy premiers, both during the coalition governments of the 1940s. The party&#x27;s influence diminished in the second half of the century, with the Conservatives having only a minor presence in the legislature after the 1950s. However, the party saw a resurgence under Rustad&#x27;s leadership in the 2024 provincial election, winning the second-most seats in its best electoral performance in 72 years.

== History ==
=== Founding and early years ===

The Conservative Party of British Columbia was formed in 1900 as the Liberal-Conservative Party, before the province officially embraced partisan politics. The party selected Charles Wilson as its first leader. Several opposition factions contested the 1900 general election against the non-partisan government, but these were generally loose affiliations. In 1902, the Conservative Party convention passed a resolution to stand candidates in the next election.

Party government was introduced on June 1, 1903, by Premier Richard McBride, when he announced the formation of an officially Conservative government. McBride believed that the system of non-partisan government that the province had until that point was unstable and inhibiting development. His Conservatives won the 1903 election, the first fought on the party system, earning a two-seat majority in the British Columbia Legislative Assembly over their rivals, the Liberal Party, as well as various Socialist and Labour MLAs. The Conservatives generally implemented policies mirroring the priorities of the national Conservative Party, which at the time favoured government intervention to help develop industry and infrastructure.

The Conservatives under McBride and his successor, William John Bowser, held power for 13 years until they were defeated by the Liberals in the 1916 election. In November 1926, the Liberal-Conservative Party formally changed its name to the Conservative Party.

=== Tolmie government and crisis ===
The Tories returned to power in the 1928 election under the leadership of Simon Fraser Tolmie, winning 35 of 48 seats in the Legislature. The Tolmie government was confronted with the Great Depression, and was wracked by infighting and indecision. The party was in such disarray that, despite being in power, the Conservative provincial association decided not to run any candidates in the 1933 election. Instead, each local association was left to act on its own, endorsing some candidates who ran as Independents, some as Independent Conservatives, and so on. Those supporting Premier Tolmie ran under the &#x27;Unionist&#x27; label, while others grouped around former premier William John Bowser and ran as part of the &#x27;Non-Partisan Independent Group&#x27;. When Bowser died and the elections in Vancouver Centre and Victoria City were postponed, four Non-partisan and two Unionist candidates withdrew.

The Conservative Party rebounded under Frank Porter Patterson to run a near-full slate in the election of 1937, however they were only able to elect eight MLAs, just one more than the growing Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) caucus. In the election of 1941, the Conservatives were able to win 12 seats, compared to 21 for the Liberals and 14 for the CCF. Members of the province&#x27;s business community, who feared the growing strength of the democratic socialist CCF, urged the Liberals and Conservatives to form a wartime coalition government to ensure stability. Then-Conservative leader Royal Maitland agreed, while then-Liberal Premier T.D. Pattullo was opposed; however, Pattullo was forced to resign by his own party in late 1941. John Hart replaced him as Liberal leader and premier on the promise to form a coalition, and did so, making Maitland Deputy Premier and Attorney General shortly thereafter.

=== Coalition years ===
In 1942, the BC Conservatives were rebranded as the BC Progressive Conservative Party, following the lead of the federal party. Maitland and Hart served throughout the remainder of World War II and continued their partnership past, running a joint ticket in the 1945 election and winning a majority government of 37 out of 48 seats. However, Maitland died suddenly in 1946 and was replaced by Herbert Anscomb, who became Deputy Premier and Finance Minister in the coalition government. When Premier Hart retired in 1947, the Conservatives pushed for Anscomb to succeed him as Premier, but the Liberals, who had more members in the coalition caucus, insisted that the role remain with a Liberal. Byron Johnson was appointed Premier a short time later, but the conflict strained relations between the two parties and leaders going forward, and caused internal divisions to open up within the Tories.

The PCs were riven into three factions: one led by Okanagan MLA W.A.C. Bennett, who called for the Liberals and Tories to fuse into a single party; a second faction that supported the status-quo; and a third that wanted Anscomb to simply lead the PCs out of the coalition. Meanwhile, the Liberals were beginning to doubt that they needed the fractious Tories to govern. The coalition was re-elected in the 1949 election, winning 39 seats against nine for the CCF opposition, but despite this, growing divisions within the Conservative Party resulted in Anscomb&#x27;s leadership being challenged at the 1950 party convention. Bennett, who had moved over to the anti-coalition faction, quit the party and crossed the floor to sit as a Social Credit League of British Columbia member, eventually forming the BC Social Credit Party.

In January 1952, the Liberals decided to dissolve the coalition, with Johnson summarily dismissing his PC ministers, including Anscomb, and continued forward as a minority government. The Conservatives properly re-founded their party and went into the 1952 election with the goal of unseating Premier Johnson.

=== Decline ===
Prior to the 1952 election, the coalition government, whose entire reason for being had been to keep the CCF out of power, introduced an instant-runoff voting system. The assumption behind the change was that business-oriented voters would keep the democratic socialist party out of power through their secondary choices, regardless of the split between the former coalition partners. However, the Social Credit League, led by Albertan Ernest George Hansell, won the most seats in the election, while the two former coalition partners fell far behind. The PCs won only four seats, not including Anscomb&#x27;s Oak Bay constituency. Two months later, former Tory W.A.C. Bennett would take control of the Socreds, dropping the party&#x27;s social credit monetary reform policy in favour of traditional and populist platforms.

It was clear to those who wanted to keep the CCF out of power that only the Socreds would be able to accomplish that task, and so business-oriented voters left the old parties behind. Having a majority government following 1953, the Social Credit government changed the electoral system back to first past the post in order to cement its base. Social Credit became, in effect, the new centre-right coalition party, and both the Liberals and the Tories became marginalized.

=== Wilderness years ===
Between the 1956 and 1972 elections, the Tories won no seats in the Legislature, and the party began to dwindle. After 1960, the party would not run a full slate of candidates again until 2024. Deane Finlayson served as leader from 1952 until 1961, eventually handing the reins to federal Member of Parliament Davie Fulton. Fulton led the party to a brief surge of relevance in the 1963 election, winning 11% of the vote but no seats, with even Fulton falling far behind his Socred opponent in the Kamloops constituency. Fulton left soon after, returning to federal politics while the BC Tories collapsed into ruin. The Party ran only three candidates in the 1966 election, and just one, then-party leader John de Wolf, in the 1969 election.

In 1971, former Socred MLA Scott Wallace, who represented Oak Bay, crossed the floor to join the PCs, becoming the party&#x27;s first MLA in 15 years. The PCs earned nearly 13% of the vote in the 1972 election and two seats—Wallace&#x27;s and Hugh Curtis in Saanich and the Islands, both in the Victoria area. The election was won by the CCF&#x27;s successor party, the New Democratic Party (NDP), who took advantage of the split between the Socreds, Tories, and resurgent Liberals to form a majority government.

Wallace was elected leader of the party in 1973. However, in 1974, his caucus mate Curtis left to join the Social Credit caucus, answering a call by new leader Bill Bennett to reunite the &#x27;pro-business&#x27; vote. Wallace was able to win his own seat in the 1975 election, but resigned in 1977 and returned to his medical practice shortly after. Wallace&#x27;s successor in Oak Bay and the party leadership was the last Tory MLA to be elected. Vic Stephens won the seat in a 1978 by-election, but lost in the following year&#x27;s general election campaign.

During this time, with most of their voters in BC supporting Social Credit, the federal Progressive Conservative Party kept its distance in order to avoid alienating Social Credit Party supporters. When the federal and provincial election campaigns overlapped in 1979, federal leader Joe Clark made obvious efforts to avoid any contact with Stephens. The Tories returned to the political wilderness in the following years. For a brief stint in 1986, former NDP MLA Graham Lea crossed the floor to sit as a PC MLA, but quit politics altogether following the dissolution of the Legislature for the 1986 election.

In 1991, the party changed its name back to the BC Conservative Party. However, the party was unable to gain traction during the collapse of the Socred government in the 1991 election and the subsequent re-alignment of BC politics. The party ran only a handful of candidates between 1991 and 2005, as the pro-business voters of the province moved en masse to the BC Liberals.

=== Twenty-first century revival efforts ===

In 2005, former BC Reform Party and Christian conservative British Columbia Party leader Wilf Hanni was elected leader of the Conservatives. The party fielded 24 candidates in the 2009 election, its highest number since 1979, and earned 2.1% of the vote. In the aftermath of the election, Hanni resigned as party leader, along with eleven directors and party officials, citing infighting.

By the end of 2010, with former Newfoundland premier Brian Peckford acting as an advisor, the party had the support of 8% of voters according to opinion polls, had approximately 2,000 members—up from 300 in June of that year—and had constituency associations established in 45 of the province&#x27;s 85 ridings. The party received another boost in 2011. After Christy Clark defeated Kevin Falcon for the BC Liberal leadership, a segment of Falcon&#x27;s supporters defected to the Conservative ranks. The Conservatives held their own leadership convention on May 28, 2011, where former Conservative Party of Canada Member of Parliament John Cummins was proclaimed leader. By late 2011, Conservative support had surged to 18%.

On March 26, 2012, Abbotsford South MLA John van Dongen announced that he was leaving the Liberals to join the Conservatives, providing the party with its first representative in the Legislative Assembly since 1986. However, six months later van Dongen switched to Independent status after Cummins was re-elected party leader without van Dongen&#x27;s support. van Dongen stated that he lacked confidence in Cummins&#x27; leadership and cited differences about the party&#x27;s direction as reasons for leaving.

In the run-up to the 2013 election, the party was able to field only 56 candidates. Nevertheless, Cummins was invited to join the leaders of the Liberals, NDP, and Greens on-stage for the leaders&#x27; debates. The Conservatives ultimately received less than 5% of the vote and had no candidates elected. On July 18, 2013, Cummins resigned as party leader. Dan Brooks was elected the new leader of the party on April 12, 2014. Brooks resigned at the party&#x27;s annual general meeting on February 20, 2016. However, stating that outstanding issues that led to his resignations were resolved, Brooks was re-elected as leader at a leadership convention held on September 17, 2016. On October 28, 2016, the party&#x27;s executive board removed Brooks from the leadership after ruling that the meeting that approved his candidacy for the leadership convention lacked quorum. Brooks criticized the decision, stating that the executive were &quot;like praying mantises, they eat their leaders&quot;.

The party did not select a new leader before the start of the 2017 election campaign. As such, the Conservatives entered the election campaign without a leader and nominated only ten candidates, none of whom were elected. In September 2017, following the party&#x27;s annual general meeting, Scott Anderson, a Vernon city councillor, was appointed interim leader by a unanimous vote of the newly elected board. Anderson oversaw the reformation of several defunct riding associations and an increase in membership, and took the party through the Kelowna West and Nanaimo by-elections. Fort St. John city councillor Trevor Bolin became the party&#x27;s new permanent leader on April 8, 2019.

The party altered its name to the Conservative Party of British Columbia prior to the 2020 general election.

During the BC Liberal leadership race in 2022, conservative commentator Aaron Gunn was disqualified by the party, which described his views as &quot;inconsistent&quot; with Liberal values including &quot;diversity and acceptance of all British Columbians&quot;. Following his disqualification, Gunn founded Common Sense BC, an advocacy group to study the viability of a right-wing alternative to the BC Liberals. Common Sense endorsed a slate of candidates who stood for election to the Conservative Party board at the May 2022 annual general meeting, effectively launching a takeover of the party. The endorsed candidates, including People&#x27;s Party of Canada founding member Angelo Isidorou, were elected, and right-wing activists took control of the party. In August 2022, the party revealed a new logo, alongside a new website and platform.

=== John Rustad leadership and resurgence ===

On February 16, 2023, John Rustad, MLA for Nechako Lakes, joined the Conservative Party, giving the party representation in the Legislature for the first time since 2012. Rustad had been elected as a Liberal but was removed from the party&#x27;s caucus in August 2022 after he refused to undo his retweet of a comment casting doubt on the scientific consensus that climate change is caused by carbon dioxide emissions; after the removal, Rustad sat as an Independent. Rustad cited &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot; with Liberal leader Kevin Falcon in explaining his decision to join the Conservatives.

Bolin announced on March 3, 2023, that he was stepping down as party leader, and that a party leadership race would be held in the near future. Three weeks later, Rustad announced that he was running for the party&#x27;s leadership. On March 31, 2023, Rustad was acclaimed as the new leader as the only candidate in the race.

In the June 2023 Vancouver-Mount Pleasant and Langford-Juan de Fuca by-elections, the Conservative candidates placed fourth and second, with 4.88% and 19.86% of the vote, respectively. The second place finish in Langford-Juan de Fuca, ahead of the centre-right BC United (formerly the BC Liberals), indicated a surge in support for the Conservatives, which was seen to echo that of the federal Conservative Party, which by 2023 was surging in national polls.On September 13, 2023, BC United MLA Bruce Banman crossed the floor to join the Conservatives. This gave the Conservatives the two MLAs necessary for official party status, and Banman was named party house leader. As a result of the party gaining official status, the Legislative Assembly Management Committee approved $214,000 in funding for the Conservative caucus, equivalent to the two-MLA Green caucus.

On May 31, 2024, BC United MLA and caucus chair Lorne Doerkson crossed the floor to the Conservatives. Doerkson was followed by BC United&#x27;s MLA for Surrey South, Elenore Sturko on June 3—she also announced her intention to run in Surrey-Cloverdale for the upcoming election— and BC United MLA for Richmond North Centre and former Minister of Trade Teresa Wat on July 29.

Leading up to the 2024 provincial election, polls showed the Conservatives displacing BC United as the main challenger to the incumbent BC NDP. On August 28, 2024, BC United leader Falcon announced that his party, lagging in the polls, was suspending its campaign after negotiations with Rustad, and that he was putting his support behind Rustad and the Conservatives. In addition, it was announced that some candidates from the BC United roster could run as Conservatives for the election. Popular support for the Conservatives surged after the announcement, with the party in a statistical tie in opinion polling with the NDP by mid-September. The rise of the Conservatives at the expense of BC United was noted by some commentators to have changed political discourse in the province, with the Conservatives and NDP both leaning more into culture war issues. The Conservatives ultimately won 44 of the 93 seats it contested, forming the official opposition and entering the Legislative Assembly for the first time since 1975.

In January 2025, Rustad and Honveer Singh Randhawa, the Conservatives&#x27; candidate in Surrey-Guildford who had lost by 22 votes, demanded an independent review of the vote count. Randhawa stated that he had filed a complaint to the BC Supreme Court under the Elections Act, outlining alleged irregularities. The complaint claims, among under things, that 22 voters in Surrey-Guildford did not reside in the riding, and 21 mail-in ballots were submitted from a residential care facility where residents had not requested mail-in ballots. The latter claim was denied by the owner of the facility. Anton Boegman, BC&#x27;s chief electoral officer, responded by saying Elections BC was reviewing the complaint and would launch a full investigation if it held merit.

== Ideology and political positions ==

For much of its history, the BC Conservative Party subscribed to a free enterprise ideology, although one that was often overshadowed by centre-right coalitions like those of the BC Social Credit and BC Liberal parties. However, the Conservatives, especially in the 21st century, sought to offer a right-wing alternative, and with the breakdown of formerly successful centre-right coalitions have enjoyed renewed popularity. In 2017, party communications director John Twigg compared the party&#x27;s populist and anti-establishment rhetoric with that of the Brexit movement and that of supporters of Donald Trump.

Under John Rustad&#x27;s leadership, the party has portrayed itself as more mainstream and &quot;common sense&quot; in order to broaden its appeal. In 2023 and 2024, Rustad described his party as a &quot;centre-right alternative&quot; to BC United, the BC NDP, and the BC Greens, while matching the rhetoric of the federal Conservative Party in focusing on affordability and crime. Rustad&#x27;s party has been labeled both centre-right and right-wing.

=== Economic issues ===
The party advocates for increased resource extraction with fewer environmental roadblocks, and calls to further develop the province&#x27;s fossil fuel and lumber industries. It seeks to eliminate the provincial carbon tax, roll back climate-friendly building codes, and consider nuclear power as an energy option. It also seeks to expand support for farmers by increasing local food processing capacity, and to bring in private auto insurance companies.

=== Healthcare ===
The party supports allowing for both public and private health-care options and allowing patients who are waiting for care in B.C. to access services at approved out-of-province clinics. It opposes COVID-19 vaccine mandates for health care workers and has promised to compensate health-care workers who lost their jobs as a result. 

=== Housing ===
In 2024, party leader John Rustad told supporters that he would scrap a housing reform by the BC NDP that legalized fourplexes on lots that previously only allowed single-family housing and sixplexes on lots near rapid transit stations. Instead, the Conservatives would work with local governments to use pre-zoning to increase density and supply in specific areas. The party has proposed a $1,500 a month housing costs rebate for both renters and homeowners starting in 2026, supports incentives for rental construction, and has promised it will not bring in low-barrier housing or homeless shelters without community consent.

=== Social issues ===
Political analysts have described the party as socially conservative, in contrast to the big tent social position of BC United. Rustad has often clashed on social issues with BC premier David Eby in the legislature. Rustad accused Eby of being an &quot;authoritarian socialist&quot; in 2023, while in 2024, Eby accused the Conservatives of embodying &quot;the worst traits of American populism&quot;.

Rustad has said that under a BC Conservative government, access to abortion and contraception &quot;will remain exactly as it is now.&quot;

The party opposes BC&#x27;s Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) education policies and safe injection sites for drug users. The party proposes that people suffering from severe drug addiction be involuntarily committed to drug rehabilitation centres, and opposes the now rolled-back NDP drug decriminalization pilot program. It supports increased funding for law enforcement and justice reform measures to deal with repeat or violent offenders.

=== Conspiracies ===
Under Rustad&#x27;s leadership, the party has been criticized by opponents for its candidates espousing conspiracy theories. Rustad has been the subject of media attention for several controversial claims, including that children may be forced to eat insects, that vaccine mandates are about &quot;shaping opinion and control on the population&quot;, and a social media post which critics said compared SOGI education and the Canadian residential school system.

In the lead-up to the 2024 election, a leaked dossier of opposition research revealed support for conspiracy theories among several party candidates. The party dropped several candidates for spreading misinformation on vaccination and medical issues, including Stephen Malthouse, Jan Webb, and Rachael Weber. The party also dropped Damon Scrase for homophobic and racist comments, and Alexandra Wright after “careful consideration of various factors related to campaign performance and conduct”. BC United implied the latter decision was because Wright had re-posted a statement calling for a criminal investigation into Health Minister Adrian Dix and Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, while Wright herself believed it was due to a conflict she had with a local fruit packer.

== Membership ==
Party membership grew from 500 to around 9,000 between Rustad&#x27;s election as leader in March 2023 and August 2024.

== Party leaders ==

=== Notes ===
: Wilson served as leader before the province officially allowed party politics.
: After resigning as leader in February 2016, Brooks ran again for leadership in September 2016; although he was elected, he was removed the following month when the party executive ruled that his nomination meeting had lacked quorum.

<doc id="471769" wikidata="Q960868" url="?curid=471769" title="Hiroshi Inagaki">
<text>was a Japanese filmmaker who worked on over 100 films in a career spanning over five decades. He is one of the most successful and critically acclaimed filmmakers in the history of Japanese cinema, having directed several &quot;jidaigeki&quot; epics such as the 1954 Academy Award-winning film &quot;Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto&quot;, and its two sequels (1955&#x27;s &quot;Samurai II: Duel at Ichijoji Temple&quot; (1955) and 1956&#x27;s &quot;Samurai III: Duel at Ganryu Island&quot;).

==Career==
Born in Tokyo as the son of a shinpa actor, Inagaki appeared on stage in his childhood before joining the Nikkatsu studio as an actor in 1922. Wishing to become a director, he joined Chiezō Kataoka&#x27;s Chiezō Productions and made his directorial debut with &quot;Tenka taiheiki&quot; (1928). Returning to Nikkatsu, he continued making jidaigeki and participated in the Naritaki Group of young filmmakers such as Sadao Yamanaka and Fuji Yahiro who collaboratively wrote screenplays under the made up name &quot;Kinpachi Kajiwara&quot;. Like others in the group, Inagaki was known for his cheerful and intelligent samurai films. Inagaki later moved to Daiei and then Toho, where he made big budget color spectacles as well as delicate works depicting the feelings of children. He also produced many films and wrote the scripts for dozens of others. He directed Toshiro Mifune in twenty films.

==Recognition==
His film &quot;Muhōmatsu no isshō&quot; (&quot;Rickshaw Man&quot;, 1943) was selected as the 8th best Japanese film of all time in a 1989 poll of Japanese critics and filmmakers. The color remake, &quot;Rickshaw Man&quot; (1958), won the Golden Lion award at that year&#x27;s Venice Film Festival. His film &quot;Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto&quot; (1954) won the honorary Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

<text>A mountain resort is a place to holiday or vacation located in an elevated and typically at least relatively isolated area. The term resort implies integral hotel or inn accommodations, restaurants, and either or both sports facilities or scenic attractions like birdwatching. These can be part of a &quot;destination resort&quot; that provides accommodations and activities or a &quot;resort town&quot; that offers amenities near outdoor areas. 

They include winter sports like skiing, snowboarding, and ice skating and summer activities such as hiking, golf, and tennis. Sightseeing and related activities, such as leaf peeping to appreciate fall colors, are also common where foliage turns.

In hot climates, hill and mountain resorts are visited for the cooler temperatures at higher elevations.

==North America==

In the United States and Canada the term &quot;mountain resort&quot; usually denotes a resort visited all year round, both for winter sports and summer activities, such as hiking, golf, tennis, and mountain biking.

Some North American mountain resorts - both resort towns and individual venues - include:
* Aspen, Colorado
* AttitashMountain Resort, New Hampshire
* Big Bear Lake, California
* Big Sky Resort, Montana
* Cranmore Mountain Resort, New Hampshire
* Flagstaff, Arizona
* Killington Ski Resort, Vermont
* Loghill Village, Colorado
* Mountain Village, Colorado
* Ouray, Colorado
* Teton Village, Wyoming
* Whistler, British Columbia
* Whitefish Mountain Resort, Montana

==India==

In British India, the colonial rulers developed resorts in the Himalayas and in mountainous areas of South India known as &quot;hill stations&quot;, where they could escape the summer heat of the plains.

==Other countries==

In the 18th century, in China, the emperors of the Qing dynasty built the Chengde Mountain Resort as a retreat from the summer heat of Beijing.

In Pakistan, the Galyat areas are a popular summer destination. They are also a favorite spot for a cold snowy experience in the winter. Murree, Ayubia, Nathiagali, and Kalabagh are some of the popular places. Other places like the Northern Areas which include Gilgit Baltistan and Kashmir are also a choice.

In the Philippines, the American colonial government built its first summer capital in Baguio to escape Manila&#x27;s heat.

In Turkey, city dwellers traditionally spent summer vacations at mountain resorts known as yaylas to escape the summer heat.

In Cyprus, the most popular mountain resort is Platres.

In Thailand, the third highest mountain is a popular resort at Doi Ang Kang in Chiang Mai&#x27;s Fang District.

<text>A resort (North American English) is a self-contained commercial establishment that aims to provide most of a vacationer&#x27;s needs. This includes food, drink, swimming, accommodation, sports, entertainment and shopping, on the premises. A hotel is frequently a central feature of a resort and the term &quot;resort&quot; may be used for a hotel that provides an array of entertainment and recreational activities. Some resorts are also condominium complexes that offer timeshares or fractional ownership, in addition to wholly owned condominiums. A resort is not always a commercial establishment operated by a single company, but in the late 20th century, that sort of facility became more common.

In British English, &quot;resort&quot; means a town which people visit for holidays and day trips, typically containing hotels where holidaymakers stay. Examples of such towns include Blackpool and Brighton.

== Amusement resort ==
A destination resort is a resort that itself contains the necessary guest attraction capabilities so it does not need to be near a destination (town, historic site, theme park, or other) to attract its patrons. A commercial establishment at a resort destination such as a recreational area, a scenic or historic site, amusement park, a gaming facility, or other tourist attraction may compete with other businesses at a destination. Consequently, another quality of a destination resort is that it offers food, drink, lodging, sports, entertainment, and shopping within the facility so that guests have no need to leave the facility throughout their stay. Commonly, the facilities are of higher quality than would be expected if one were to stay at a hotel or eat in a town&#x27;s restaurants. Some examples are Atlantis in the Bahamas; the Walt Disney World Resort, near Orlando, Florida; Universal Studios Hollywood in San Fernando Valley, United States; PortAventura World, near Tarragona on the Costa Daurada in Spain; Costa do Sauípe, Northeastern Brazil; Laguna Phuket, Thailand and Sun City, near Johannesburg, South Africa. Closely related to resorts are convention and large meeting sites. Generally, these resorts are located in cities where they offer special meeting halls, ample accommodations, and a variety of dining and entertainment options.

== All-inclusive resort ==

An all-inclusive resort charges a fixed price that includes most or all items. At a minimum, most inclusive resorts include lodging, unlimited food, drink, sports activities, and entertainment for the fixed price. In recent years, the number of resorts in the United States offering &quot;all-inclusive&quot; amenities has decreased dramatically. In 1961, over half offered such plans, but in 2007, less than a tenth do so.

All-inclusive resorts are found in the Caribbean, particularly in Jamaica, Dominican Republic; in Egypt, and elsewhere. Notable examples are Club Med, Sandals Resorts, and Beaches Resorts.

An all-inclusive resort includes three meals daily, soft drinks, most alcoholic drinks, gratuities, and usually other services in the price. Many also offer sports and other activities included in the price as well. They are often located in warmer regions. The all-inclusive model originated in the Club Med resorts, which were founded by the Belgian Gérard Blitz.

Some all-inclusive resorts are designed for specific groups. For example, some resorts cater for adults only, and even more-specialized properties accept couples only. Other all-inclusive resorts are geared toward families, with facilities like craft centers, game rooms, and water parks to keep children of all ages entertained. All-inclusive resorts are also very popular locations for destination weddings.
== Recreation ==

A spa resort is a short-term residential/lodging facility with the primary purpose of providing individual services for spa goers to develop healthy habits. Historically, many such spas were developed at the location of natural hot springs or sources of mineral waters. Typically over a seven-day stay, such facilities provide a comprehensive program that includes spa services, physical fitness activities, healthy diet programs, and special interest programming.

Golf resorts are resorts that cater specifically to the sport of golf, and they include access to one or more golf courses and/or clubhouses. Golf resorts typically provide golf packages that provide visitors with all greens and cart fees, range balls, accommodations, and meals.
In North America, a ski resort is generally a destination resort in a ski area. The term is less likely to refer to a town or village.
A megaresort is a type of destination resort of an exceptionally-large size, such as those along the Las Vegas Strip. In Singapore, &quot;integrated resort&quot; is a euphemism for a casino-based destination resort.

A holiday village is a type of self-contained resort in Europe whose accommodation is generally in villas. A holiday camp, in the United Kingdom, refers to a resort whose accommodation is in chalets or static caravans.

A resort hotel contains full-sized luxury facilities with full-service accommodations and amenities. These hotels may attract vacationing tourists and offer more than a convenient place to stay.

== Timeshare ==
There are more than 1500 timeshare resorts in the United States that are operated by major hospitality, timeshare-specific, or independent companies. They represent 198,000 residences and nearly 9 million owners, who pay an average $880 per year in maintenance fees. A reported 16% of the residences became vacation rentals.

== Notable historic resorts ==
* Baiae, Italy, a famous historic resort of the ancient world that was popular over 2000 years ago. 
* Capri, an island near Naples, Italy, has attracted visitors since Roman times.
* Monte Ne, near Rogers, Arkansas, a famous historic resort which was active in the early 20th century. At its peak, more than 10,000 people a year visited its hotels. Two of its hotels, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row, were the largest log buildings in the world. Monte Ne closed in the 1930s and was ultimately submerged under Beaver Lake in the 1960s.
* Tawawa House, also known as Tawawa Springs or Xenia Springs, inspired Dolen Perkins-Valdez to write her debut novel, &quot;Wench&quot; (2010), when she read about it in an autobiography of W.E.B. Du Bois. The book mentioned in passing that the land for Wilberforce University had once been used for a privately owned resort called Tawawa House, where white slave owners would bring the black slaves that they kept as mistresses.

== Resort towns ==
Towns that are resorts or in which tourism or vacationing is a major part of the local activity are sometimes called resort towns. If by the sea, they are called seaside resorts. Inland resorts include ski resorts, mountain resorts and spa towns. Well-known resort towns include Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, Bandipur in Nepal, Bali in Indonesia, Sochi in Russia, Mount Lebanon Tourism in Lebanon, Barizo in Spain, Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo in Italy, Druskininkai in Lithuania, Cartagena de Indias in Colombia, Cancún in Mexico, Newport, Rhode Island, and Key West, Florida, in the United States, Ischgl in Austria, St. Moritz in Switzerland and Blackpool in the United Kingdom.
A resort island is an island or an archipelago that contains resorts, hotels, restaurants, tourist attractions, and its amenities. Maldives is considered to have the best island resorts, which have become famous among the top celebrities and sportspersons around the world.
Seaside resorts are located on a coast. In the United Kingdom, many seaside towns have turned to other entertainment industries, and some of them have much nightlife. The cinemas and theatres often remain to become host to a number of pubs, bars, restaurants, and nightclubs. Most of their entertainment facilities cater for both local people and visitors and the beaches still remain popular during the summer months.
In Europe and North America, ski resorts are towns and villages in ski areas, with support services for skiing such as hotels and chalets, equipment rental, ski schools and ski lifts to access the slopes.

Resorts for different purposes also exist. An example is Yulara, Northern Territory, which exists to serve Uluru (Ayers Rock) and Kata Tjuta (The Olgas) in Australia.

<doc id="471783" wikidata="Q1422720" url="?curid=471783" title="The Waterboys">
<text>The Waterboys are a rock band formed in 1983 by Scottish musician and songwriter Mike Scott. The band&#x27;s membership, past and present, has been composed mainly of musicians from Scotland, Ireland, Wales and England. Mike Scott has remained the only constant member throughout the band&#x27;s career. They have explored different styles, but their music is mainly a mix of folk music with rock and roll (folk rock). They dissolved in 1993 when Scott departed to pursue a solo career. The group reformed in 2000, and continue to release albums and to tour worldwide. Scott emphasises a continuity between the Waterboys and his solo work, saying that &quot;To me there&#x27;s no difference between Mike Scott and the Waterboys; they both mean the same thing. They mean myself and whoever are my current travelling musical companions.&quot;

The early Waterboys sound became known as &quot;The Big Music&quot; after a song on their second album, &quot;A Pagan Place&quot;. This style was described by Scott as &quot;a metaphor for seeing God&#x27;s signature in the world.&quot; Waterboys chronicler Ian Abrahams elaborated on this by defining &quot;The Big Music&quot; as &quot;...a mystical celebration of paganism. It&#x27;s extolling the basic and primitive divinity that exists in everything (&#x27;the oceans and the sand&#x27;), religious and spiritual all encompassing. Here is something that can&#x27;t be owned or built upon, something that has its existence in the concept of Mother Earth and has an ancestral approach to religion. And it takes in and embraces the feminine side of divinity, pluralistic in its acceptance of the wider pantheon of paganism.&quot;

&quot;The Big Music&quot; either influenced or was used to describe other bands specializing in an anthemic sound, including U2, Simple Minds, In Tua Nua, Big Country and Hothouse Flowers.

In the late 1980s, the band became significantly more folk-influenced. The Waterboys eventually returned to rock and roll, and have released both rock and folk albums since reforming.

==History==
The Waterboys have gone through four distinct phases. Their early years, or &quot;Big Music&quot; period was followed by a folk music period which was characterised by an emphasis on touring over album production and by a large band membership, leading to the description of the group as a &quot;Raggle Taggle band&quot;. After the release of a mainstream rock and roll album with &quot;Dream Harder&quot;, the band dissolved until they reunited in 2000. In the years since, they have revisited both rock and folk music, and continue to tour and release studio albums.
=== Formation ===
Scott, the Edinburgh-born son of a college lecturer, is the founder and only permanent member of the Waterboys. Having begun his career in teenage Ayr punk band White Heat and its Edinburgh successor Another Pretty Face, he moved to London and formed another short-lived band, The Red and the Black. This latter band included saxophone player Anthony Thistlethwaite, whom Scott had included after hearing him play on &quot;Waiting on Egypt&quot;, a Nikki Sudden album. The Red and the Black performed nine concerts in London, during which Thistlethwaite introduced Scott to drummer Kevin Wilkinson (previously with Stadium Dogs, Barry Andrews side-project Restaurants for Dogs and the League of Gentlemen), who also joined the band.
During 1982, Scott made a number of recordings, both solo and with Thistlethwaite and Wilkinson. These sessions, recorded at Redshop Studio in Islington during late 1981 and early 1982, are the earliest recordings that would be released under the Waterboys&#x27; name and would later be divided between the Waterboys&#x27; first and second albums.

In 1983, even though Scott had signed to Ensign Records as a solo act, he decided to start a new band. He chose the Waterboys as its name, from a line in the Lou Reed song &quot;The Kids&quot; on the album &quot;Berlin&quot;. In March 1983, Ensign released the first recording under the new band name, a single titled &quot;A Girl Called Johnny&quot;, the A-side of which was a tribute to Patti Smith. This was followed in May by the Waterboys&#x27; first performance as a group, on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;. The BBC performance included a new member, keyboard player Karl Wallinger (a multi-instrumentalist and Beatles fanatic who&#x27;d previously been in the pre-Alarm band Quasimodo as well as having spent a spell as musical director for &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;). 

The Waterboys released their self-titled debut, &quot;The Waterboys&quot;, in July 1983. Their music, influenced by Patti Smith, Bob Dylan and David Bowie, was compared by critics to Van Morrison and U2 in its cinematic sweep. The band&#x27;s earlier sound was described as a new wave and post-punk.

=== Early years: the Big Music ===
After the release of their debut, the Waterboys began touring. Their first show was at the Batschkapp Club in Frankfurt in February 1984. The band then consisted of Mike Scott on vocals and guitar, Anthony Thistlethwaite on saxophone and mandolin, Wallinger on keyboards, Roddy Lorimer on trumpets, Martyn Swain on bass and Kevin Wilkinson on drums. John Caldwell (from Another Pretty Face) also played guitar, and Scottish singer Eddi Reader sang backing vocals for the band&#x27;s first two concerts.

In late 1983 and early 1984, the band made some new recordings and over-dubbed old material, all of which was released as the Waterboys&#x27; second album, &quot;A Pagan Place&quot;, in June 1984. The &quot;official&quot; Waterboys line-up at this time, according to the sleeve of &quot;A Pagan Place&quot;, was Scott, Thistlethwaite, Wallinger and Wilkinson, with guest contributions from Reader, Lorimer and many others. The release of the album was followed by further touring in the UK, Europe and US including support for The Pretenders and U2 and a show at the Glastonbury Festival.

&quot;A Pagan Place&quot; was preceded by the single &quot;The Big Music&quot;. The name of the single&#x27;s A-side track was adopted by some commentators as a description of the Waterboys&#x27; sound, and is still used to refer to the musical style of their first three albums, which were built up by Scott from hard-panned multiple twelve-string rhythm guitars, rolling piano and judicious use of reverb to form &quot;a shimmering wall of music&quot; and added to by saxophone, occasional violins or trumpets, plus Wallinger&#x27;s increasing breadth of instrumentation (which now included synth bass, various other orchestral synthesizer experiments and percussion). 

Although Wilkinson left the Waterboys to concentrate on his other project, China Crisis, the band began to record new material in early 1985 for a new album. Late in the sessions, future Waterboy Steve Wickham added his violin to the track &quot;The Pan Within&quot;; he had been invited after Scott had heard him on a Sinéad O&#x27;Connor demo recorded at Karl Wallinger&#x27;s house. The Waterboys (officially a trio of Scott, Thistlethwaite and Wallinger, with a slew of guests) released their third album, &quot;This Is the Sea&quot;, in October 1985. It sold better than either of the two earlier albums, and managed to get into the Top Forty. A single from it, &quot;The Whole of the Moon&quot;, reached number 26 in the UK Singles Chart. Promotion efforts were hampered by Scott&#x27;s refusal to perform on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, which insisted that its performers lip sync. The album release was followed by successful tours of the UK and North America, with Wickham becoming a full-time member, Marco Sin replacing Martyn Swain on bass, and Chris Whitten replacing Kevin Wilkinson on drums.

Wallinger (a budding songwriter and producer in his own right, who&#x27;d co-produced and arranged much of the initial album sessions, including &quot;The Whole of the Moon&quot;), was by now chafing under Scott&#x27;s leadership and songwriting dominance. During the American tour, he announced his departure and subsequently left to form his own successful solo project (later band) World Party. Roddy Lorimer rejoined the band on subsequent tour dates to widen the sound. Wallinger was later replaced as keyboard player by Guy Chambers (who&#x27;d later become Robbie Williams&#x27;s songwriting partner), and at the same time, former Ruts drummer Dave Ruffy replaced Chris Whitten. Sin left the Waterboys towards the end of the next European tour, following a heroin overdose, with Thistlethwaite covering for him on bass for the last few concert dates.

=== 1986–1988: The Raggle Taggle band and &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Blues&quot; ===

Having become discouraged by the stadium rock career path he was now being expected to follow (and frustrated by his inability to recreate the Waterboys&#x27; expansive studio sound in a live rock setting), Scott was now becoming interested in American roots music, (country, gospel, cajun and blues), something in which he was enthusiastically supported by Thistlethwaite and Wickham. At Wickham&#x27;s invitation, Scott moved to Dublin where he could pursue these ideas at a remove from the music industry and in a more congenial musical climate. The band&#x27;s line-up changed once again with Scott, Wickham and Thistlethwaite (the latter now focussing at least as much on mandolin as on saxophone) now joined by Trevor Hutchinson on bass and a succession of drummers, starting with Peter McKinney.

The new band, which the official Waterboys&#x27; website refers to as the &quot;Raggle Taggle band&quot; line-up, spent 1986 recording in Dublin and touring the UK, Ireland, Europe and Israel with a lineup of Scott, Wickham, Thistlethwaite, Hutchinson and a returning Dave Ruffy. In late November 1986, Scott, Thistlethwaite and Wickham (minus Hutchinson) spent a week in California recording roots and roots-inspired music with producer Bob Johnston and various American session players. McKinney was back on drums for live dates in early 1987, but had been replaced by Fran Been by summer 1987 in a Waterboys lineup which now included Uilleann piper Vinnie Kilduff and which played a free date on the Greenpeace vessel &quot;Sirius&quot; in Dublin harbour. Another former Waterboy, trumpeter Roddie Lorimer, briefly rejoined for a performance at the Pictish Festival in Letham, Scotland. Some of the performances from this era were released in 1998 on &quot;The Live Adventures of the Waterboys&quot;, including a famous Glastonbury performance in 1986. 

In late 1987 Scott temporarily relocated to Spiddal in Galway in the west of Ireland, resulting in a deeper immersion in Irish music and culture. In early 1988 he brought the band there, where they set up a recording studio in Spiddal House to finish recording their new album. Patti Smith Group drummer Jay Dee Daugherty was briefly a member of the band for the Spiddal sessions, which featured the Scott, Wickham, Thistlethwaite and Hutchinson core augmented by visiting West Coast Irish folk musicians. 

&quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Blues&quot; was released in October 1988, finally pulling together various tracks from the vast stockpile recorded in Dublin and Spiddal over the previous three years and showcasing many of the guest musicians and temporary members that had played with the band during that time. It also illustrated the Waterboys&#x27; three-year journey through roots, country, gospel, blues and Irish/Scottish traditional music. Critics and fans were split between those embracing the new folk influences and others disappointed after hoping for a continuation of the style of &quot;This Is the Sea&quot;. &quot;World Music: The Rough Guide&quot; notes that &quot;some cynics claim that Scotsman Mike Scott gave Irish music back to the Irish... his impact can&#x27;t be underestimated&quot;, but Scott himself explains that it was the Irish tradition that influenced him; &quot;I was in love with Ireland. Every day was a new adventure, it was mythical... Being part of a brotherhood of musicians was a great thing in those days, with all the many musicians of all stripes we befriended in Ireland. I still have that connection to the Irish musicians and tap into it...&quot; 

Owing to the large number of tracks that were recorded in the three years between &quot;This Is the Sea&quot; and &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Blues&quot;, the Waterboys released a second album of songs from this period in 2001, titled &quot;Too Close to Heaven&quot; (or &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Blues, Part 2&quot; in North America), and more material was released as bonus tracks for the 2006 reissue of the remastered &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Blues&quot; album.

=== 1989–1990: The Magnificent Seven and &quot;Room to Roam&quot; ===

The Waterboys toured to support &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Blues&quot; with a lineup of Scott, Wickham, Thistlethwaite, Hutchinson, Daugherty, Kilduff, Lorimer and two other musicians who&#x27;d contributed to the album – whistle/flute/piano player Colin Blakey (a traditionally-minded member of Scottish folk-punk band We Free Kings) and veteran Irish Sean-nós singer Tomás Mac Eoin. By summer 1989 the lineup of the band had changed yet again, with Kilduff, Mac Eoin and Lorimer departing and Daugherty being replaced by Dublin drummer Noel Bridgeman (another contributor to &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Blues&quot;). Scott had also recruited teenage accordionist Sharon Shannon, already a rising Irish folk star, as part of his developing plan to bring &quot;the marriage of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll and trad&quot; into the band. Scott referred to this new line-up as &quot;the Magnificent Seven&quot; and &quot;the high summer of the Celtic Waterboys&quot;. 

After further touring, the band returned to Spiddal to record a new album produced by Barry Beckett. Scott&#x27;s initial concept was &quot;(a) dream of merging trad and pop in a rootsy &quot;Sgt Pepper&quot;&quot; but as recording progressed he realised that the production process exposed flaws within the band and compromises in the music, which began to slowly unravel both the existing line-up and the Waterboys&#x27; Celtic focus. The resulting album, &quot;Room to Roam&quot; was released in September 1990 and met with to mixed-to-poor reviews, further dampening Scott&#x27;s enthusiasm for his current course. 

The &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; lineup disintegrated just before the release of &quot;Room to Roam&quot;, during tour rehearsals: Scott and Thistlethwaite had opted to fire Noel Bridgeman and replace him with a &quot;tougher&quot; drummer. Wickham, already discouraged, disagreed and chose to leave the band. Louisianan drummer Ken Blevins, a more rock-oriented musician, was recruited to replace Bridgeman, but it became evident that the &quot;Room to Roam&quot; music didn&#x27;t work without a fiddle in the band, and Shannon and Blakey were asked to leave. With Blivens on drums, Scott, Thistlethwaite and Hutchinson fulfilled the group&#x27;s tour dates. Unable to play the folk-and-roots material of the past five years, the Waterboys doggedly re-embraced a rock sound and reverted to sets drawn from their first three albums, brand new songs written post-&quot;Room to Roam&quot; and Dylan covers.

=== 1991–1993: &quot;Dream Harder&quot; and the end of the Waterboys ===
During 1991, the Waterboys continued to go through major changes. Discouraged by the collapse of his Celtic music adventure, and by the disintegration of the musical family which had surrounded the Raggle Taggle Band and the Magnificent Seven – and determined to be playing rock music again – Scott left Dublin and moved to New York, while Trevor Hutchinson left the band altogether to become a trad folk musician. Although the band was in pieces, a re-released issue of their 1985 single &quot;The Whole of the Moon&quot; (which had gained a new lease of life on the dance and rave scenes as a comedown track) reached number three in the UK Singles Chart, prompting the release of a compilation album, &quot;The Best of The Waterboys 81–90&quot;, which in turn reached number two in the UK Albums Chart as well as fulfilling the band&#x27;s contract with Chrysalis Records. This success put the band in a good position for signing a new contract, and they duly signed to Geffen Records. 

In America, Scott immersed himself in live music in New York and Chicago, wrote new songs and auditioned potential new Waterboys (including, for the first time, lead guitarists). Regretfully concluding that there was &quot;no place&quot; in the new songs and style for Anthony Thistlethwaite, he parted company with his longest-surviving bandmate in December 1991. Now the only remaining Waterboy, Scott recruited drummer Carla Azar and bass player Charley Drayton (the latter soon replaced by former Zappa band member Scott Thunes) to record the next Waterboys album &quot;Dream Harder&quot;, along with guitarist Chris Bruce and assorted session musicians. 

&quot;Dream Harder&quot; was released in May 1993 and saw the band embracing a new hard rock-influenced sound. Although the album produced two UK Top 30 singles &quot;The Return of Pan&quot; and &quot;Glastonbury Song&quot;, Scott had become frustrated, still feeling discouraged by the disappointing end of his Celtic phase and feeling that &quot;Dream Harder&quot; had captured him at &quot;half power&quot; despite his efforts. Frustrated by not being able to get a new touring Waterboys band together, Scott decided to make further changes. He abandoned the &quot;Waterboys&quot; name, left New York and moved to northeast Scotland for the first of several stays at the Findhorn Foundation, exploring the esoteric spiritual ideas which he&#x27;d first encountered in London bookstores during the early 1980s.

=== 1994–2000: Mike Scott solo, and the Waterboys return with &quot;A Rock in the Weary Land&quot; ===

In 1994, having divided the intervening time between Dublin and the Findhorn Foundation, Scott returned to London and embarked on a solo career which produced two albums – the almost wholly acoustic &quot;Bring &#x27;Em All In&quot; (1995) and the rock-and-soul-inspired &quot;Still Burning&quot; (1995). Although Scott himself was happy with both records, neither performed well commercially, resulting in the end of his Geffen contract. In 1998, Scott performed a solo show at the Galway Arts Festival, at which he reunited on stage with Steve Wickham and Anthony Thistlethwaite for the encore. In October 1999, Scott and Wickham reunited for a full gig in Sligo. 

Also during 1999, Scott began re-establishing his musical direction, &quot;bringing (him)self up to speed with rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll&quot; and basing his new sound on a &quot;psychedelic elemental roar&quot; aided by assorted effects pedals, an Electro-Harmonix MicroSynth, a blues harmonica microphone, harmoniums, a Hindu beat box and a Theremin. The result, released at the end of September 2000, was a new album called &quot;A Rock in the Weary Land&quot;, for which Scott resurrected the Waterboys name (citing its recognition amongst fans). The album had a new, experimental rock sound inspired by contemporary bands Radiohead and Beck and described by Scott as &quot;sonic rock&quot;. As well as new Scott associates such as Thighpaulsandra and Gilad Atzmon, a number of old Waterboys guested on the album: Anthony Thistlethwaite, Kevin Wilkinson and Dave Ruffy. (This would be one of Wilkinson&#x27;s final appearances on record, due to his death by suicide on 17 July 1999, aged forty-one.)

By the summer of 2000, Scott had assembled a new Waterboys lineup – himself on voice and guitar, Richard Naiff on keyboards and organs, bass player Livingston Brown and drummer Jeremy Stacey. Wickham guested on fiddle at live dates in Dublin and Belfast on the resulting tour of late 2000, and rejoined the band permanently in January 2001.

=== 2003–2013: &quot;Universal Hall&quot;, &quot;Book of Lightning&quot;, &quot;An Appointment with Mr Yeats&quot; ===

Scott, Wickham and Naiff were the core of the Waterboys by 2003, when the group changed direction once again and released &quot;Universal Hall&quot;, a mostly acoustic album with a return of some Celtic influences from the &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Blues&quot; era as well as aspects of New Age music and dance electronica. The album was followed by a tour of the UK and then Europe. Their first official live album, &quot;Karma to Burn&quot;, was released in 2005 – with Carlos Hercules on drums, Steve Walters on bass and a guest appearance by Sharon Shannon on accordion – showing off the band&#x27;s acoustic and electric sides.

A new studio album, &quot;Book of Lightning&quot; (which revived some of the noisy psychedelic rock aspects of &quot;A Rock in the Weary Land&quot;), was released 2 April 2007 with yet another lineup. Scott, Naiff and Wickham were joined in the studio by Leo Abrahams (lead guitar), bass player Mark Smith and drummer Brian Blade, while further contributions were made by further former Waterboys from various recording and touring bands (Jeremy Stacey, Roddy Lorimer, Chris Bruce and Thighpaulsandra). This line-up came up to an end over the course of 2009 – Richard Naiff left in February to spend more time with his family, while Smith died suddenly and unexpectedly in November 2009 at the age of forty-nine, leaving Scott and Wickham as the band core. 

In 2010, having harboured the idea for 20 years, Mike Scott set twenty W. B. Yeats poems to music in an enterprise that evolved into a show entitled &quot;An Appointment With Mr. Yeats&quot;. The Waterboys held the show&#x27;s world premiere from 15 to 20 March 2010 in Yeats&#x27;s own theatre, the Abbey Theatre, Dublin. The five-night show quickly sold out, later receiving several rave reviews, among which were &quot;The Irish Times&quot; and Irish actor/playwright Michael Harding. Some of the poems performed included &quot;The Hosting of the Sidhe&quot;, &quot;The Lake Isle of Innisfree&quot;, &quot;News for the Delphic Oracle&quot;, and &#x27;The Song of Wandering Aengus&#x27;, along with an amalgamation of two Yeats lyrics that became the song &#x27;Let the Earth Bear Witness&#x27; which Scott had produced during &#x27;The Sea of Green&#x27; 2009 Iranian election protests. The musical arrangements for the poems were varied and experimental. On the band&#x27;s website Scott described the arrangements as &quot;psychedelic, intense, kaleidescopic, a mix of rock, folk and faery music&quot;, the delivery of which signalled yet another musical shift in the ever-mutable world of the Waterboys.

&quot;An Appointment With Mr. Yeats&quot; returned to Dublin on 7 November 2010 in the city&#x27;s Grand Canal Theatre. The show was performed at the Barbican Hall, London in February 2011. The album version of &quot;An Appointment With Mr. Yeats&quot; was released on 19 September 2011 and reached the UK Top 30. The band line-up for this album centred on Scott, Wickham and the new Waterboys members James Hellawell (keyboards), Marc Arciero (bass) and Ralph Salmins (drums), joined by guests including oboist Kate St. John and Irish folk singer Katie Kim.

In 2011, the Waterboys released further archive recordings in the shape of &quot;In a Special Place – The Piano Demos for This Is the Sea&quot;. In 2013, they released the entire set of recordings from the three-year &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Blues&quot; sessions as a six-CD box set called &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Box&quot;.

=== 2014–present: &quot;Modern Blues&quot;, soul, funk and beats ===

Ralph Salmins remained with Scott and Wickham for the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Modern Blues&quot;, which was first announced in October 2014 and released on 19 January 2015 in the United Kingdom (7 April in North America). Inspired mostly by soul and blues, the album was recorded in Nashville, and produced by Mike Scott and mixed by Bob Clearmountain. The line up introduced another new Waterboys keyboard player, &quot;Brother&quot; Paul Brown (replacing Hallawell), while bass was provided by veteran Muscle Shoals bass player David Hood. The record featured other country/rhythm-and-blues musicians including Zach Ernst, Don Bryant and Phil Madeira. The first UK single from the Modern Blues album was &#x27;November Tale&#x27;.

&quot;Modern Blues&quot; was followed in 2017 by a double studio album, &quot;Out of All This Blue&quot;, which built on the soul and blues of its predecessor while adding more funk and contemporary dance rhythms, and was released on 8 September by BMG Records. Scott described it as &quot;two-thirds love and romance, one-third stories and observations... the songs just kept coming, and in pop colours.&quot; The first single from the album was &quot;If The Answer Is Yeah&quot;, released in July.

Aongus Ralston had joined as permanent Waterboys bass player in 2016 and participated in the recording for the next studio album, &quot;Where the Action Is&quot;, which was announced in March 2019 and released on 24 May by Cooking Vinyl. It continued the Waterboys ongoing love affair with soul, blues and funk while also experimenting with hip hop. The first UK single from the album was &#x27;Right Side Of Heartbreak (Wrong Side Of Love)&#x27;, released on 14 March. On 21 May 2019, the band shared the music video for the third single off the record, &quot;Ladbroke Grove Symphony&quot;: a tribute to the former bohemian heart of West London in which Mike Scott invoked his time living and writing among the crumbling, seaside-esque streets of Notting Hill during the 1980s. The accompanying montage video captured the magic of the Grove in all its weird and wonderful counterculture, and featured new film and vintage photography of Scott as he told the story of the song.

The band&#x27;s fourteenth studio album &quot;Good Luck, Seeker&quot; was released on 21 August 2020, continuing the band&#x27;s contemporary American roots explorations while also re-engaging with some of their Irish folk interests and with the spoken word. The first song to be previewed from the album was &quot;My Wanderings in the Weary Land&quot; on 5 June. The single &quot;The Soul Singer&quot; was released on 15 July. 

The band&#x27;s former drummer, Noel Bridgeman, died on 23 March 2021 aged seventy-four. On 3 December 2021, the Waterboys released another box set, &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, containing archive live, studio and session recordings of the 1989–1990 &quot;Room to Roam&quot; band featuring Scott, Wickham, Bridgeman, Anthony Thistlethwaite, Trevor Hutchinson, Sharon Shannon and Colin Blakey. 

Wickham was absent from the band&#x27;s fifteenth studio album, &quot;All Souls Hill&quot;, which was initiated during the Covid lockdown period of 2020, and featured extensive collaborations between Scott (in his home studio) and a new collaborator – composer/producer/frequent Paul Weller collaborator Simon Dine. While still utilising the hip-hop/electric roots music approach of the previous three Waterboys albums, it also went deeper into the Irish folk and poetry aspects of the band&#x27;s late &#x27;80s/early &#x27;90s phase. It was released by Cooking Vinyl on 6 May 2022.

The Waterboys announced Steve Wickham&#x27;s second formal departure from the band on 14 February 2022. Having realised that he was now more connected with the band&#x27;s &quot;legacy&quot; music rather than the creation of its new material, Wickham opted to step down from regular involvement to focus on his own music and other projects. Both Wickham and other band members stated that he would remain &quot;part of the Waterboys family&quot; and return for other Waterboys projects in the future. Another longstanding Waterboys family member, Anthony Thistlethwaite, briefly rejoined the band for festival dates in July and August 2022.

In December, 2024, Scott announced on social media that a new Waterboys&#x27; LP would be released in April, 2025. 

== Music ==
The Waterboys&#x27; lyrics and arrangements reflect Scott&#x27;s current interests and influences, the latter including the musical sensibilities of other members. Wickham in particular had a tremendous impact on the band&#x27;s sound after joining the group. In terms of arrangement and instrumentation, rock and roll and Celtic folk music have played the largest roles in the band&#x27;s sound. Literature and spirituality have played an important role in Scott&#x27;s lyrics. Other contributing factors include women and love, punk music&#x27;s DIY ethic, the British poetic tradition, and Scott&#x27;s experiences at Findhorn, where he lived for some years.

=== Sound ===
The Waterboys&#x27; music can be divided into four distinct styles. The first is represented by the first three albums, released between 1983 and 1985. The band&#x27;s arrangements during this period, described by Allmusic as a &quot;rich, dramatic sound... majestic&quot;, and typically referred to as &quot;The Big Music&quot;, combined the rock and roll sound of early U2 with elements of classical trumpet (Lorimer), jazz saxophone (Thistlethwaite) and contemporary keyboards (Wallinger). Scott emphasised the arrangement&#x27;s fullness by using production techniques similar to Phil Spector&#x27;s &quot;Wall of Sound&quot;. The archetypal example, the song &quot;The Big Music&quot;, gave the style its name, but the best-selling example was &quot;The Whole of the Moon&quot;, the song that the early 1980s Waterboys are best known for and that demonstrates both Wallinger&#x27;s synthpop keyboard effects and the effectiveness of the brass section of the band.

After Wickham&#x27;s joining and the move to Ireland, the band went three years before releasing another album. &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Blues&quot;, and more particularly &quot;Room to Roam&quot;, traded &quot;The Big Music&quot;&#x27;s keyboards and brass for traditional instruments such as tin whistle, flute, fiddle, accordion, harmonica, and bouzouki. Celtic folk music replaced rock as the main inspiration for song arrangements on both albums. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; describes the sound as &quot;an impressive mixture of rock music and Celtic ruralism..., Beatles and Donovan echoes and, of course, lots of grand guitar, fiddle, mandolin, whistle, flute and accordion playing&quot;. Traditional folk songs were recorded along with those written by Scott. &quot;The Raggle Taggle Gypsy&quot;, a British folk ballad at least two hundred years old, was recorded on &quot;Room to Roam&quot;. It became closely associated with the band, much as the song &quot;The Big Music&quot; did, and also gave its name to describe the band&#x27;s character. The recording emphasises how distinctly different the band&#x27;s music had become in the five years since the last of &quot;The Big Music&quot; albums.

After the break-up of the &quot;Raggle Taggle band&quot;, Scott used the Waterboys&#x27; name for &quot;Dream Harder&quot; and &quot;A Rock in the Weary Land&quot;. These two albums, separated by seven years and bookending Scott&#x27;s solo album releases, were both rock albums but with distinctive approaches to that genre. &quot;Dream Harder&quot; was described as &quot;disappointingly mainstream&quot;, whereas the sound of the &quot;A Rock in the Weary Land&quot; was inspired by alternative music and was praised by critics. For 2003&#x27;s &quot;Universal Hall&quot;, however, Wickham had once again rejoined the band, and that album saw a return of the acoustic folk instrumentation of the late 1980s Waterboys, with the exception of the song &quot;Seek the Light&quot;, which is instead an idiosyncratic EBM track.

Since 2014, the Waterboys have embraced a style drawing from contemporary American blues, rock, soul, funk and hip-hop, while at points revisiting aspects of their Irish folk influences.

=== Literary influences ===
Scott, who briefly studied literature and philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, has made heavy use of English literature in his music. The Waterboys have recorded poems set to music by writers including William Butler Yeats (&quot;The Stolen Child&quot; and &quot;Love and Death&quot;), George MacDonald (&quot;Room to Roam&quot;), and Robert Burns (&quot;Ever to Be Near Ye&quot;). A member of the Academy of American Poets writes that &quot;the Waterboys&#x27; gift lies in locating Burns and Yeats within a poetic tradition of song, revelry, and celebration, re-invigorating their verses with the energy of contemporary music&quot;. So close is the identification of the Waterboys with their literary influences that the writer also remarks that &quot;W.B.&quot;, the initials to which Yeats&#x27; first and middle names are often shortened, could also stand for &quot;Waterboys&quot;. The Waterboys returned to W.B. Yeats in March 2010. Having arranged 20 of his poems to music, the band performed them as &quot;An Appointment With Mr Yeats&quot; for five nights at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin (which Yeats co-founded in 1904). The liner notes from the CD edition of &quot;Room to Roam&quot; acknowledge author C.S. Lewis as an influence, and the title of the song &quot;Further Up, Further In&quot; is taken from a line in his novel &quot;The Last Battle&quot;.

Scott has also a number of poetic tropes in lyrics, including anthropomorphism (e.g. &quot;Islandman&quot;), metaphor (e.g. &quot;A Church Not Made with Hands&quot;, &quot;The Whole of the Moon&quot;), and metonymy (e.g. &quot;Old England&quot;). The latter song quotes from both Yeats and James Joyce. While the lyrics of the band have explored a large number of themes, symbolic references to water are especially prominent. Water is often referenced in their songs (e.g. &quot;This Is the Sea&quot;, &quot;Strange Boat&quot;, &quot;The Stolen Child&quot;, &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Blues&quot;). The Waterboys&#x27; logo, first seen on the album cover of &quot;The Waterboys&quot;, symbolises waves.

=== Spirituality ===
The Waterboys&#x27; lyrics show influences from different spiritual traditions. The first is the romantic Neopaganism and esotericism of authors such as Yeats and Dion Fortune, which can be observed in the repeated references to the ancient Greek deity Pan in both &quot;The Pan Within&quot; and &quot;The Return of Pan&quot;. Pan was also featured on the album art for &quot;Room to Roam&quot;. &quot;Medicine Bow&quot;, a song from the recording sessions for &quot;This Is the Sea&quot;, refers to Native American spirituality in its use of the word &quot;medicine&quot; to mean spiritual power. Scott&#x27;s interest in Native American issues is also demonstrated in his preliminary recordings for the group&#x27;s debut album, which included the songs &quot;Death Song of the Sioux Parts One &amp; Two&quot; and &quot;Bury My Heart&quot;. &quot;Bury My Heart&quot; is a reference to Dee Brown&#x27;s &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot;. a history of Native Americans in the western United States. Scott took the traditional Sioux song &quot;The Earth Only Endures&quot; from &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot;, and set it to new music; the arrangement appears on &quot;The Secret Life of the Waterboys&quot;. Christian imagery can be seen in the songs &quot;December&quot; from &quot;The Waterboys&quot;, &quot;The Christ in You&quot; on &quot;Universal Hall&quot;, and indirectly in the influence of C. S. Lewis in a number of other songs, but Scott writes that his lyrics are not influenced by Christianity.

Scott has also said, &quot;I&#x27;ve always been interested in spirituality, and I&#x27;ve never joined any religion. And it really turns me off when people from one religion say theirs is the only way. And I believe all religions are just different ways to spirituality. And if you call that universality, well, then I&#x27;m all for it.&quot; Despite Scott&#x27;s pluralist perspective, the Waterboys have been labelled as &quot;Christian rock&quot; by some reviewers and heathens by some Christians.

== Members ==

Over seventy musicians have performed live as a Waterboy. Some have spent only a short time with the band, contributing to a single tour or album, while others have been long-term members with significant contributions. Scott has been the band&#x27;s lead vocalist, motivating force, and principal songwriter throughout the group&#x27;s history, but a number of other musicians are closely identified with the band.

Scott has stated that &quot;We&#x27;ve had more members I believe than any other band in rock history&quot; and believes that the nearest challengers are Santana and the Fall.

<text>Whitnash is a town and civil parish located southeast of, and contiguous with Leamington Spa and Warwick in Warwickshire, England. In 2001, it had a population of 7,760 which increased to 9,129 in the 2011 census, increasing again to 10,489 in the 2021 census.

==History==
Whitnash was mentioned in the Domesday Book as &quot;Witenas&quot;, by 1326 it had become &quot;Whitenasshe&quot; meaning &#x27;white ash&#x27;. As Whitnash is generally thought to derive from the Anglo-Saxon ‘at the white ash’ other derivations have included ‘place by the wood’, ‘sacred ash’ or the &#x27;meeting place of the wise&#x27;. Whitnash has likely been settled since Celtic times. According to tradition, just east of the town there was a Celtic fortification in a field known as “Castle Hill Field”. The parish church of St Margaret&#x27;s is of Anglo-Saxon origin, and stands on a mound which may have been a pre-Christian pagan site, it was largely rebuilt between 1855 and 1880 to designs by Sir George Gilbert Scott.

Whitnash at one time had a holy well, located around 400 metres east of the town. According to a local legend, a church bell was dropped accidentally into the well when it was being taken there to be consecrated, according to the legend, the bell then gained the ability to foretell the future; at night time people would drop a stone into the well and ask a question. Then at daybreak it would give its answer: one ring for yes and two for no. The bell is commemorated in Whitnash&#x27;s municipal crest.

Whitnash was for most of its history a small village, the population in 1931 was 586. Around the historic core of the old village are a number of older half timbered buildings dating from the 17th century, including the &quot;Plough and Harrow&quot; inn. Until modern times, Whitnash was a fairly isolated community, which has led to it retaining a strong sense of local identity. 

Dramatic population growth began during the second half of the 20th century. Reflecting its much larger size, in 1978 Whitnash became a town through the resolution of its parish council; thenceforth the parish council became a town council.

==Town centre==

Whitnash does not have a well defined town centre as such; with Leamington Spa town centre only 2 miles to the north, a central district for Whitnash never developed, and the town expanded residentially only, around the small historic core around St. Margaret&#x27;s Church. Whitnash has three neighbourhood shopping areas around Coppice Road, Heathcote Road /Acre Close and Home Farm Crescent. In November 2021, the Town Council completed development of its new Civic Centre and Library, which has the Town Council office, library, café, conference room and sports hall suitable for badminton and other recreational activities.

==Education==
There are four primary schools in the town: Whitnash Primary, St Joseph&#x27;s RC Primary, St Margaret&#x27;s Middle School and Briar Hill First School. There are no secondary schools located in Whitnash, but the state schools Campion School, Myton School and Trinity Catholic School name Whitnash as being within their priority areas.

==Politics==
The Whitnash Residents&#x27; Association dominates the local political scene, holding all the town&#x27;s seats on Warwick District Council and Whitnash Town Council. It also holds the town&#x27;s seat on Warwickshire County Council and has done for many years. The association was founded as the Whitnash Ratepayer&#x27;s Association in 1977.

==Recreation==
At the Whitnash Sports &amp; Social Club, there is a petanque club (http://www.whitnashpetanque.co.uk/) and Lawn Bowls club. Whitnash Sports and Social club is the new home of the Leamington Royals rugby league team, who represent Royal Leamington Spa, Warwick and the surrounding areas in the Midlands RL Conference. Whitnash Town FC is the local association football club. The Leamington and County golf club is also within the parish.

==Local media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Sutton Coldfield TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC CWR, Capital Mid-Counties, Hits Radio Coventry &amp; Warwickshire, Fresh (Coventry &amp; Warwickshire), Heart West Midlands, Smooth West Midlands, and Greatest Hits Radio Midlands.

Published by the Town Council from July 2003 until December 2022, Whitnash had a free quarterly news pamphlet called the ‘&#x27;Whitnash Tymes&quot; which was delivered to every residence in the town. Usually entailing messages from the mayor and local authorities, listings, local business advertisements, local news, and events.

==Demographics==
The 2021 census recorded that 78.2% of Whitnash residents were White, 15.5% were Asian, 0.9% were Black, 2.8% were Mixed, with 2.5% belonging to any other ethnic group. In terms of religion 46.1% were Christian, 36.6% had no religion, 12% were Sikh, 3.2% were Hindu, and 1.5% Muslim.

<text>Snopes (), formerly known as the Urban Legends Reference Pages, is a fact-checking website. It has been described as a &quot;well-regarded reference for sorting out myths and rumors&quot; on the Internet. The site has also been seen as a source for both validating and debunking urban legends and similar stories in American popular culture. 

==History==

=== 1990s ===
In 1994, David and Barbara Mikkelson created an urban folklore web site that would become &quot;Snopes.com&quot;. &quot;Snopes&quot; was an early online encyclopedia focused on urban legends, which mainly presented search results of user discussions based at first on their contributions to the Usenet newsgroup alt.folklore.urban (AFU) where they&#x27;d been active. The site grew to encompass a wide range of subjects and became a resource to which Internet users began submitting pictures and stories of questionable veracity. According to the Mikkelsons, &quot;Snopes&quot; predated the search engine concept of fact-checking via search results. David Mikkelson had originally adopted the username &quot;Snopes&quot; (the name of a family of often unpleasant people in the works of William Faulkner) in AFU.

=== 2000s ===
In 2002, the site had become known well enough that a television pilot by writer-director Michael Levine called &quot;Snopes: Urban Legends&quot; was completed with American actor Jim Davidson as host. However, it did not air on major networks.

=== 2010s ===
By 2010, the site was attracting seven million to eight million unique visitors in an average month.
By mid-2014, Barbara had not written for &quot;Snopes&quot; &quot;in several years&quot; and David hired users from &quot;Snopes.com&quot;&#x27;s message board to assist him in running the site. The Mikkelsons divorced around that time. Christopher Richmond and Drew Schoentrup became part owners in July 2016 with the purchase of Barbara Mikkelson&#x27;s share by the internet media management company Proper Media.

On March 9, 2017, David Mikkelson terminated the brokering agreement with Proper Media, which was also the company that provided &quot;Snopes&quot; with web development, hosting, and advertising support. The move prompted Proper Media to stop remitting advertising revenue and to file a lawsuit in May. In late June, Bardav—the company founded by David and Barbara Mikkelson in 2003 to own and operate &quot;snopes.com&quot;—started a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to continue operations. They raised $500,000 in 24 hours. Later, in August, a judge ordered Proper Media to disburse advertising revenues to Bardav while the case was pending.

In July 2018, &quot;Snopes&quot; abruptly terminated its contract with Managing Editor Brooke Binkowski, with no explanation. By the time &quot;Snopes&quot; co-founder and CEO David Mikkelson confirmed the termination to her, the situation was still not clear.

In early 2019, &quot;Snopes&quot; announced that it had acquired the website &quot;OnTheIssues.org&quot;, and is &quot;hard at work modernizing its extensive archives&quot;. &quot;OnTheIssues&quot; is a website that seeks to &quot;present all the relevant evidence, assess how strongly each piece supports or opposes a position, and summarize it with an average&quot; in order to &quot;provide voters with reliable information on candidates&#x27; policy positions&quot;.

In 2018 and 2019, &quot;Snopes&quot; fact-checked several articles from &quot;The Babylon Bee&quot;, a satirical website, rating them &quot;False&quot;. The decision resulted in Facebook adding warnings to links to those articles shared on its site. &quot;Snopes&quot; added a new rating called &quot;Labeled Satire&quot; to identify satirical stories.

In 2019, &quot;Snopes&quot; was embroiled in legal disputes with Proper Media, with a court case scheduled for spring 2020. By then Proper Media had become a co-owner of Bardav through acquiring Barbara Mikkelson&#x27;s half-interest share, intending to take overall ownership of Snopes for its own &quot;portfolio of media sites&quot;. The move failed as David Mikkelson had no intention to sell his share.

=== 2020s ===
==== COVID-19 pandemic and misinformation ====

As the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, many people tried to &quot;educate themselves on the coronavirus&quot; and find &quot;any comfort, certainty, or hope for a cure [for the coronavirus]&quot;. &quot;Snopes&quot; has around 237 COVID-related fact-checking articles.

==== Plagiarism by co-founder David Mikkelson ====

On August 13, 2021, &quot;BuzzFeed News&quot; published an investigation by reporter Dean Sterling Jones that showed David Mikkelson had used plagiarized material from different news sources in 54 articles between 2015 and 2019 in an effort to increase website traffic. Mikkelson also published plagiarized material under a pseudonym, &quot;Jeff Zarronandia&quot;. The &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; inquiry prompted &quot;Snopes&quot; to launch an internal review of Mikkelson&#x27;s articles and to retract 60 of them the day the &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; story appeared. Mikkelson admitted to committing &quot;multiple serious copyright violations&quot; and apologized for &quot;serious lapses in judgment.&quot; He was suspended from editorial duties during the investigation, but remained an officer and stakeholder in the company.

==== Change of ownership ====
On September 16, 2022, David Mikkelson stepped down as CEO and was succeeded by shareholder and board member Chris Richmond. Richmond and fellow shareholder Drew Schoentrup together acquired 100% of the company, ending the ownership dispute which began in 2017.

==Main site==
Snopes aims to debunk or confirm widely spread urban legends. The site has been referenced by news media and other sites, including CNN, MSNBC, &quot;Fortune&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. By March 2009, the site had more than six million visitors per month. David Mikkelson ran the website from his home in Tacoma, Washington.

Mikkelson has stressed the &quot;reference&quot; portion of the name &quot;Urban Legends Reference Pages&quot;, indicating that the intention is not merely to dismiss or confirm misconceptions and rumors but to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well. Where appropriate, pages are generally marked &quot;undetermined&quot; or &quot;unverifiable&quot; when there is not enough evidence to either support or disprove a given claim.

In an attempt to demonstrate the perils of over-reliance on the Internet as authority, &quot;Snopes&quot; assembled a series of fabricated urban folklore tales that it termed &quot;The Repository of Lost Legends&quot;. The name was chosen for its acronym, T.R.O.L.L., a reference to the internet slang term &quot;troll&quot;, meaning an online persona intended to be deliberately provocative or incendiary.

In 2009, &quot;FactCheck.org&quot; reviewed a sample of &quot;Snopes&quot;&#x27;s responses to political rumors regarding George W. Bush, Sarah Palin, and Barack Obama, and found them to be free from bias in all cases. In 2012, &quot;The Florida Times-Union&quot; reported that &quot;About.com&quot;&#x27;s urban legends researcher found a &quot;consistent effort to provide even-handed analyses&quot; and that Snopes&#x27; cited sources and numerous reputable analyses of its content confirm its accuracy.

Mikkelson has said that the site receives more complaints of liberal bias than conservative bias, but added that the same debunking standards are applied to all political urban legends.

== Funding ==
In 2016, &quot;Snopes&quot; said that the entirety of its revenue was derived from advertising. In the same year it received an award of $75,000 from the James Randi Educational Foundation, an organization formed to debunk paranormal claims. In 2017, it raised approximately $700,000 from a crowd-sourced &quot;GoFundMe&quot; effort and received $100,000 from Facebook as a part of a fact-checking partnership. &quot;Snopes&quot; also offers a premium membership that disables ads.

On February 1, 2019, &quot;Snopes&quot; announced that it had ended its fact-checking partnership with Facebook. &quot;Snopes&quot; did not rule out the possibility of working with Facebook in the future but said it needed to &quot;determine with certainty that our efforts to aid any particular platform are a net positive for our online community, publication and staff&quot;. &quot;Snopes&quot; added that the loss of revenue from the partnership meant the company would &quot;have less money to invest in our publication—and we will need to adapt to make up for it&quot;.

&quot;Snopes&quot; publishes a yearly summary detailing expenses and sources of income.

<doc id="471793" wikidata="Q1067220" url="?curid=471793" title="Queen Street, Toronto">
<text>Queen Street is a major east–west thoroughfare in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It extends from Roncesvalles Avenue and King Street in the west to Victoria Park Avenue in the east. Queen Street was the cartographic baseline for the original east–west avenues of Toronto&#x27;s and York County&#x27;s grid pattern of major roads. The western section of Queen (sometimes simply referred to as &quot;Queen West&quot;) is a centre for Canadian broadcasting, music, fashion, performance, and the visual arts. 

==History==

Since the original survey in 1793 by Sir Alexander Aitkin, commissioned by Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe, Queen Street has had many names. For its first sixty years, many sections were referred to as Lot Street, section west of Spadina was named Egremont Street until about 1837. East of the Don River to near Coxwell Avenue it was part of Kingston Road (and resuming as Queen Street thereafter), and was the westernmost section of that historic route to Kingston, Ontario, whose western terminus today is just east of Coxwell. The first park lots laid out in the new city of York (which would be renamed Toronto in 1834) were given to loyal officials who were willing to give up the amenities of modern cities such as Kingston to take up residence in the forests north of Lot Street. These lots were placed along the south side of the first east–west road laid in York, Lot Street. In the 1840s, Lot Street was renamed in honour of Queen Victoria.

&quot;Queen West&quot; is local vernacular which generally refers to the collection of neighbourhoods that have developed along and around the thoroughfare. Many of these were originally ethnically-based neighbourhoods. The earliest example from the mid-19th century was Claretown, an Irish immigrant enclave in the area of Queen Street West and Bathurst Street. From the 1890s to the 1930s, Jewish immigrants coalesced in the neighbourhood known as &quot;the Ward&quot;, for which Queen Street between Yonge and University served as the southern boundary. The intersection of Queen and Bay Streets also served as the southern end of a thriving Chinatown in the 1930s. From the 1920s to the 1950s, the area was also the heart of Toronto&#x27;s Polish and Ukrainian communities. From the 1950s through the 1970s, many immigrants from Portugal settled in the area. Gentrification over the past twenty years has caused most recent immigrants to gradually move to more affordable areas of the city as desirability of the area drives up prices.

Like other gentrified areas of Toronto, the original &quot;Queen West&quot; —the stretch between University Avenue and Spadina Avenue — is now lined with upscale boutiques, chain stores, restaurants, tattoo parlours and hair salons. Perhaps the best-known landmark on this section of Queen West is the broadcast hub at 299 Queen Street West, formerly the headquarters of Citytv and MuchMusic and earlier the site of the Ryerson Press, now housing the broadcast operations of a number of television outlets owned by Bell Media. Queen Street East, though not as famous as Queen Street West, is known for its shopping, especially in nearby neighbourhoods.

Until the 1940s and 50&#x27;s Queen Street extended west (in several sections) along what is today The Queensway, with the name changed through the westernmost segment though the former Etobicoke in 1947 to avoid confusion due to the break. The other sections were a stub of the street continuing west of Roncesvalles and ending at Colborne Lodge Drive by High Park, and a short side street in Swansea running west from Ellis Avenue. When The Queensway was extended east in the 1950s, the latter two section where absorbed into it, rather than having the name &quot;Queen Street&quot; restored to the now-continuous street, likely due to the Borough of Etobicoke desiring a counterpart to another street called The Kingsway.

A legacy of The Queensway being formerly part of Queen Street is still evident in a parallel street known as &quot;North Queen Street&quot; north of Sherway Gardens, which was once a jogged section of Queen St./The Queensway west of Kipling Avenue, later bypassed by a direct extension of the street&#x27;s southern baseline to connect to The Middle Road, the precursor to the Queen Elizabeth Way.

During the 1982 Toronto municipal election candidate Deanne Taylor established headquarters at The Cameron House - performing nightly with the Hummer Sisters west of Spadina.

== Route ==

=== Fallingbrook to Woodbine: The Beaches ===

The commercial district of Queen Street East lies at the heart of The Beaches community. It is characterized by a large number of independent specialty stores. The stores along Queen are known to change tenants quite often causing the streetscape to change from year to year, sometimes drastically. East of Woodbine Avenue, Queen street has less traffic and is effectively reduced to one lane each way (the outer lanes are used for on-street parking). The centre lanes are used by the 501 streetcar. The first few blocks from Fallingbrook Rd. to Victoria Park Ave. are located in Scarborough, the easternmost part of Toronto, where Queen is only a minor residential side street, which continues west to the Neville Park streetcar loop, the eastern end of the 501 route, before widening into a thoroughfare. Around the intersection with Victoria Park, the south side of the street is beside the R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant, a crucial water treatment plant for both Toronto and York Region.

=== Woodbine to Coxwell ===

From Woodbine to Coxwell, Queen Street is in parts of two neighbourhoods, Upper Beaches and The Beaches. From Woodbine to Kingston Road, there&#x27;s a mix of newer commercial/residential buildings. The northern half is covered with various modern looking stores, with the southern half covered by a retail development by &quot;The Behar Group&quot;, consisting of 5 residential condos, with ground floor retail spaces. The section of Kingston to Coxwell is similar in design, but without the retail development on the southern side, including the Alliance Cinemas &quot;The Beach&quot; location. A little to east of the Queen/Eastern/Kingston intersection there is the northern border of Woodbine Park, used for outdoor events.

=== Coxwell to Jones: Leslieville ===
The area from Greenwood to Logan is known as Leslieville. Queen passes underneath the elevated CN railway tracks, and this marks the border of Leslieville. Queen Street East is the commercial hub of Leslieville. In Leslieville, Queen is home to many small stores and restaurants. From Greenwood (Vancouver Avenue) to Woodfield, the northern side of the street is beside the Ashbridge Estate, a large historic estate. The Russell Carhouse is also on this stretch of Queen Street.

=== Jones to Don River: Riverdale ===

The place between Logan and the Don River is called Riverdale. Since its amendment to the City of Toronto in 1884, the area has developed a stature as a neighbourhood of independent arts, with several independent galleries located along Queen Street East. The residential landscape within Riverdale is made up primarily of Victorian and Edwardian style homes, constructed in the 1800s as boarding rooms for the working-class. It is a mixed income and multicultural area, currently experiencing a trend of gentrification along Queen Street East. Queen is home to a number of landmarks in this area, including the New Edwin Hotel, New Broadview House Hotel, The Opera House, and the Ralph Thornton Community Centre.

=== Queen Street Viaduct ===

The Queen Street Viaduct, along with the surrounding bridges, carry traffic on Queen Street over the Don River. The bridge was originally constructed in 1803 as a wooden bridge. The current bridge was conducted in 1910 and is a steel truss bridge. The surrounding bridge goes east to Davies Avenue and west to River Street, splitting into Queen Street and King Street just west Bayview Avenue (east of River Street).

=== Don River to Yonge ===

The section for the Don River to Yonge Street is located in Downtown Toronto. East of Parliament Street is the Trefann Court area that was the site of a major debate over development in the 1960s. Until reaching Jarvis Street, the north side is the Moss Park neighbourhood, with the park and Moss Park Armoury along the street. South of Queen is the Corktown neighbourhood. In the east side of downtown it passes St. Michael&#x27;s Hospital and Metropolitan United Church. At Yonge Street in the downtown core, the street is in the Financial District and at the Eaton Centre.

=== Yonge to University ===


Since the 19th century, Queen Street West at Yonge Street has been one of Toronto&#x27;s primary shopping destinations. Originally, the Eaton&#x27;s and Simpson&#x27;s department stores faced each other across Queen Street, with the rivalry between the two stores at one time as central to Toronto retailing as the Macy&#x27;s/Gimbel&#x27;s competition was to New York City&#x27;s retail history. The pedestrian crosswalk on Queen Street, just to the west of the intersection with Yonge Street, was for years one of the busiest in Canada, as thousands of shoppers a day comparison shopped between Eaton&#x27;s and Simpson&#x27;s.

Today, Eaton&#x27;s is gone, but the Toronto Eaton Centre still remains at the same location, one of Canada&#x27;s largest office and shopping complexes. Simpson&#x27;s is also gone, but the historic department store building remains on the south side of Queen Street, occupied by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay and Saks Fifth Avenue stores.

Further west, this stretch of Queen Street is dominated by institutional and cultural buildings such as Old City Hall, Toronto City Hall, Osgoode Hall and the Four Seasons Centre.

=== University to Spadina: Queen West ===


The area between University and Spadina Avenues was a cultural in the 1980s known for its cheap restaurants, clubs, eclectic mix of musicians and artists and was a haven for the punk rock scene with its famous club kids such as Kinga, Seika, Wanda and a host of others. In the 1960s and into the early 1980s, this stretch of Queen Street West was an aging commercial strip, known for &quot;greasy spoon&quot; restaurants and inexpensive housing in the area. In the late 1970s and 1980s, the area was transformed by local students, including those of the nearby Ontario College of Art &amp; Design, and the area developed an active music scene which was one of the dominant centres of Canadian music in its era.

The late 1980s saw the relocation of CityTV to 299 Queen Street West which gentrified the area almost overnight. A more mainstream culture soon attracted other artists, wider audiences, and wealthier businesses to the area. Small independent businesses started to move further west on Queen Street West past Spadina Avenue and Bathurst Street for the cheaper rent, an area at the time which was desolate after working hours. The push continued into the mid- and late 2000s and into Parkdale until that area also became associated with trendy businesses, and now condos.

By the mid-1990s with the opening of mainstream stores such as Le Château, probably the first chain store on the strip, the name &quot;Queen Street&quot; became synonymous with terms such as &quot;trendy&quot;, &quot;hip&quot;, and &quot;cool&quot;. While original businesses such as the Cameron, the Horseshoe Tavern and The Rivoli have remained and changed little, the strip is now cluttered with mid- and higher-end international chain stores such as H&amp;M and Zara, the antithesis of what the area was about in the 1970s and 1980s.

The broadcast hub at 299 Queen Street West (formerly called the CHUM-City Building), housing a number of Bell Media&#x27;s television operations, is located at the corner of Queen and John Streets in this area. By the mid-1990s MuchMusic become associated with Queen Street&#x27;s culture; the station&#x27;s VJs have often broadcast their segments live from outside the building, and programs such as &quot;Electric Circus&quot; and the &quot;MuchMusic Video Awards&quot; have regularly taken place &quot;on&quot; the street.

St. Patrick&#x27;s Market, at 238 Queen Street West, was founded in the late 1830s. The current building dates from 1912. This property is currently home to a communal food market, currently undergoing renovations the property is slated to re-open in 2018.

=== Spadina to Trinity Bellwoods Park ===
From Spadina to Bathurst, Queen Street is lined with street-level retail, with upper level apartments. Bates and Dodds, Toronto&#x27;s oldest operating funeral home is at 931 Queen St. West, across from Trinity Bellwoods Park and has been in the same location since 1884. As rents rose, most artists began moving westward to this section of Queen. In the early 1990s, the newly vogue area became associated with nightclubs such as the Bovine Sex Club and several antique shops.

Occupying the same area, between Spadina Avenue and Trinity Bellwoods Park south of Queen Street, is Toronto&#x27;s Fashion District. In the later 1990s, high-priced clothing stores opened in the same area as the gentrification of the district continued. In the 2000s, the changing character of Queen Street West gave rise to concerns in some quarters over the pace and implications of gentrification.

On February 20, 2008, a large fire destroyed several buildings on the south side of the street, between Bathurst and Portland Streets. The block had been declared a heritage conservation district by the city only the year before. Toronto Fire Services&#x27; &quot;active incidents&quot; website reported the fire as six-alarm intensity, with over 14 separate units dispatched to the scene throughout the day. Several neighbourhood businesses and apartments were destroyed in the blaze. In some cases, the destruction caused by the fire gave rise to additional angst over the changing character of Queen Street West and the potential nature of the new development that would eventually replace the burned buildings.

=== Bathurst to Dufferin: West Queen West ===

Between Bathurst Street and Gladstone Avenue is West Queen West, also known as the Art and Design District. For this two-kilometer stretch, nearly every storefront on the north side is either a gallery, bar, or nightclub (the south side of the street is largely taken up by the buildings and grounds of the former Queen Street Mental Health Centre, now part of CAMH), a combination that has led to the district being named one of the coolest neighborhoods in the world both in 2015 and 2016. The Stephen Bulger Gallery, founded in 1994, is also located on Queen West, as was the Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art (MOCCA), which relocated to the area in 2005.

MOCCA moved out of the area in 2018. In 2013, the developer Urbancorp applied to demolish the MOCCA and the adjacent buildings housing the Edward Day and Clint Roenisch Gallery and replace them with the nine-story &quot;MOCCA Condo&quot;. The museum moved to a former factory building on Sterling Road north of Dundas Street West.

In 2014, Vogue Magazine ranked the neighborhood second in their compilation of the world&#x27;s top 15 hippest neighborhoods, second only by Shimokitazawa, Tokyo.

Another cause of this gallery conglomeration was the conversion of a former police building (Art-Deco building for Metro Toronto Police 6 Division built in 1931 and closed in the 1990s) into Gallery 1313, with extensive financial assistance by the city. A large amount of gallery space, including such galleries as Loop and Fly, allowed Toronto artists of all levels of ability to show their work at a low cost. Unlike the boutique-oriented storefronts of the eastern portion of the street, the Gallery District contains an abundance of space available for special events. The Camera Bar—originally established by film director and producer Atom Egoyan—is now operated by the Stephen Bulger Gallery as a rental space that offers a bar and film/video screening venue.

West Queen West has undergone rapid transformation in the past couple of years. Rents have increased dramatically and many galleries have left. Recent departures include Sis Boom Bah, Luft Gallery, Burston Gallery and Brackett Gallery. At the same time as galleries have closed, many new bars have opened. Many attribute this sudden shift to the development spearheaded by the Drake Hotel, a former flophouse recently renovated and converted to a boutique hotel at a cost of $6 million.

The Gladstone Hotel is one of a few pre-existing businesses in the area that has been able to capitalize on the recent boom. This grand old railroad-era hotel had over the years fallen into disrepair and maintained itself by renting boarding-house-style accommodation. Now gentrified, the tavern on the first floor is home to a weekly &quot;Art Bar&quot;, where locals from the arts community converge to socialize. In 2005, it underwent a major renovation spearheaded by the Zeidler family.

In 2013, Artscape Youngplace opened at 180 Shaw Street, just north of Queen Street West, after a major renovation and community consultation process. Artscape&#x27;s $17 million transformation of the building, the former Shaw Street School, was completed just before the centenary of its construction in 1914. Artscape Youngplace is a 75,000 sq. ft. centre for creative collaboration housing a diverse mix of creators working in a variety of disciplines, as well as arts, community and social mission organizations.

The Queen West Art Crawl (QWAC) is an annual three-day festival celebrating the arts on Queen Street West and featuring the artists, arts organizations and businesses on the thoroughfare. It is produced by the not-for-profit Parkdale Liberty Economic Development Corporation.

The area between Trinity Bellwoods Park and Roncesvalles Avenue has been referred to as &quot;Queer West&quot; or &quot;Queer Street West&quot;, an LGBTQ enclave in Toronto similar to the Church-Wellesley Village. The community started to form in the 1970s thanks to the General Idea artistic collective and their contributions to &quot;FILE Megazine&quot;. In the 1980s, the Operation Soap police raids affected some of the gay bathhouses in the community like The Barracks. As the area developed in the early 2000s, plans for condo expansions stirred gentrification concerns, leading to local &quot;queer kiss-in&quot; protests. Over the years, the area has been home to various LGBTQ-friendly bars, restaurants, stores, and venues. The Queer West community suffered several closures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

==== West Queen West BIA ====

The businesses on the stretch of Queen West from Bathurst to Gladstone Ave. have organized the West Queen West Business Improvement Area, which is mandated to undertake streetscape improvement projects, organize community events and promote the neighbourhood&#x27;s unique commercial establishments.

Its vision is to retain the unique character of the West Queen West business community in the midst of renewal and growth, while attracting visitors/tourists to an area known to boast high concentrations of art and culture. The BIA promotes the West Queen West neighbourhood as a distinct destination for residents and tourists.

=== Dufferin to Roncesvalles: Parkdale ===
Until November 2010, Dufferin and Queen was a two-legged intersection broken up by the Queen Street subway (a historic CN railway bridge underpass first built in 1898) in the 1200 block, but due to major re-construction, this is now a four-way intersection. Once past there, Queen Street West makes its way through Parkdale. Parkdale is one of Toronto&#x27;s oldest neighbourhoods, and a former independent village, and Queen Street is its main commercial strip, with two and three-storey mixed use buildings, retail on the ground-floor and residences above. Many of the buildings date to the 1880s era when Parkdale was an independent village.

There are numerous bars and restaurants along this section. There is also an increasing number of storefront art galleries, part of an increasing number of artists locating in the area. The lane way parallel to Queen on the south side is decorated with murals, and is nicknamed the &#x27;Milky Way.&#x27; There is a business improvement association in this area, grouping businesses in the area under the &#x27;Parkdale Village&#x27; banner. The Parkdale Library is located at Cowan Avenue, and Masaryk-Cowan Community Centre is located just south of Queen Street on Cowan. Parkdale has a higher proportion of lower-income residents and there are several support agencies located along Queen.

== Public transit ==

=== 501/301 Queen ===


The 501 Queen is an east–west Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) streetcar route, running on Queen Street. The 501 Queen streetcar remains one of the TTC&#x27;s busiest and longest streetcar routes; it runs every six minutes in each direction (traffic permitting). Queen Street West is also served by Osgoode station at University Avenue. Service is provided 24 hours a day, though overnight service between 1 am and 5 am is operated as one of three streetcar routes on the TTC&#x27;s Blue Night Network under the route number 301 Queen, with less frequent service.

=== Queen Street subway ===

Beneath Queen Street West is a little-known urban artifact. In the 1940s, the Toronto Transit Commission proposed to construct, in addition to a rapid-transit subway under Yonge Street, a second tunnel under Queen Street that would allow the PCC streetcars from certain routes to avoid other traffic as they ran through central areas. The Queen subway would run from Trinity Bellwoods Park in the west to Broadview Avenue in the east. This two-line plan was approved by referendum in 1946, but when hoped-for funding from the government of Canada did not materialize, the Queen line was postponed. In the 1960s, the TTC decided that a subway to replace the crowded Bloor Street streetcars would be more valuable, as after the construction of the Yonge line most of the passenger traffic had moved north with the subway. While the Queen line remained on the list of proposals into the 1970s, it was never again a priority.

When the Yonge subway was being constructed in the early 1950s, the shell of an east–west station for the Queen line, sometimes called Lower Queen, was built under its Queen station, and passenger flows within the station were laid out on the assumption that it would eventually be an interchange. In the 1990s, some of the space was reused for a pedestrian passage when the subway station was being made wheelchair-accessible, but the rest of the station shell remains empty to this day.

In more recent transit planning, the Ontario Line is proposed to run below Queen from Spadina Avenue to Parliament Street, connecting to the Yonge-University Line at Osgoode and Queen stations while also serving three other stations on Queen Street: Queen-Spadina (one stop west of Osgoode station; underground), Moss Park (one stop east of Queen-Yonge station; underground), and Riverside-Leslieville (three stops east of Moss Park station; elevated).

<text>Newcastle Falcons is a rugby union team that play in Premiership Rugby, England&#x27;s highest division of rugby union.

The club was established in 1877 as the Gosforth Football Club. Around 1882 the club merged with the Northumberland Football Club and briefly assumed their name until 1887. In 1990, the name was changed to Newcastle Gosforth and the club began to play at Kingston Park stadium in Kingston Park, Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1996, following the start of professionalism the club briefly adopted the name Newcastle Rugby Club before adopting its current name.

Newcastle has won 5 major titles. They won the Premiership in 1998 and four domestic cups in 1976, 1977, 2001 and 2004.

Newcastle was the only English club of Jonny Wilkinson, where he played from 1997 to 2009, and as well as Wilkinson in 2003 Newcastle saw three players in the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final with Mathew Tait starting and Toby Flood appearing from the bench. Mark Wilson played in the 2019 Rugby World Cup Final while at the club.

==History==
===Name changes===
* Gosforth Football Club (1877–1882)
* Northumberland Football Club (1882–1887); Merged with Northumberland FC and assumed their name.
* Gosforth Football Club (1887–1990); Reverted name back to Gosforth FC.
* Newcastle Gosforth (1990–1995)
* Newcastle Rugby Club (1996); Turned professional; Junior players let go and formed Gosforth Rugby Football Club.
* Newcastle Falcons (1997–present)

=== Early years (1877–1990s) ===
The original Gosforth Football Club was founded in 1877 by a group of Old Boys of Durham School, in whose colours of green and white hoops the club played until the mid-1990s. The name Gosforth came from one of the suburbs of Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1955, the club moved to a new ground at North Road which was to be its home until 1990. During that time and particularly in the late 1970s Gosforth enjoyed tremendous success both on and off the field winning the John Player Cup in seasons 1975–76 and 1976–77. 
Gosforth supplied innumerable players to all counties over the years, to the North of England sides and to the full international and British Lions teams. These include Arthur Smith, Ray McLoughlin, Malcolm Young, Roger Uttley, Peter Dixon, Duncan Madsen, Dave Robinson, Richard Breakey, Jim Pollock and Colin White.

In 1990 the club name was changed to Newcastle Gosforth and they moved to Kingston Park. Gosforth Rugby Football Club continued as an amateur side working in partnership with Northumbria University and currently play at Broadway West.

===Professional era===
For the 1996–97 season the new name of Newcastle Falcons and new black-and-white colours were adopted, after local businessman Sir John Hall took control and attempted to create a sporting club in Newcastle that would emulate the success of the Barcelona model. The four teams that made up that sporting club were the football team, nicknamed the Magpies, the Newcastle Eagles basketball team, the Newcastle Cobras (later Riverkings, Jesters, Vipers) ice hockey team and the Newcastle Falcons rugby union team.

Newcastle was the first fully &quot;professional&quot; club in the world. In 1995, Hall installed former Wasps captain Rob Andrew as his salaried Director of Rugby and saw the club earn promotion from the national Second Division to the Premiership.

The following season, Newcastle became English Premiership champions at their first attempt in 1997–98. Alongside Andrew, the Championship winning side starred cross-code All Black, Samoa and Rugby League legend Inga Tuigamala, Scotland legends Doddie Weir and Gary Armstrong, England star Tony Underwood, British and Irish Lions stars Alan Tait and John Bentley and youngster Jonny Wilkinson.

During the following 1998–99 season Newcastle didn&#x27;t play in Europe, as English teams did not take part, but the Falcons did go on to the Tetley&#x27;s Bitter Cup final against Wasps, which was lost 29–19. In 1999, Rob Andrew retired allowing for 20-year-old international Jonny Wilkinson to assume the fly half role full-time. Andrew would remain as Director of Rugby.

Hall sold the Falcons for a &#x27;nominal&#x27; sum in 1999 to local businessman Dave Thompson, under whom the Falcons won two Powergen Cups: in 2001 the Falcons beat Harlequins FC 30–27; and in 2004 the Falcons beat 37–33 against Sale Sharks.

In 2004, legendary Wallabies full-back Matt Burke signed for the Falcons. For the Falcons, Burke played alongside former English rival Jonny Wilkinson (his opposite kicker in the 2001 British and Irish Lions tour of Australia). In Wilkinson, Burke, England international Dave Walder and emerging future England number 10 Toby Flood the Falcons had adequate competition for kicking duties over the coming seasons, despite long-term injuries to Jonny Wilkinson. During the 2004–05 season the Falcons recorded their best ever Heineken Cup performance to date by winning their pool and progressing to a quarter-final tie against Stade Français in the Parc des Princes.

In August 2005 Falcons toured Japan pre-season. They beat NEC Green Rockets easily but lost to a fired-up Toyota Verblitz.

In August 2006 Rob Andrew left the Falcons to take charge of the England set-up ahead of the 2007 World Cup in a wide-ranging role that encompasses all aspects of the professional representative game in England. John Fletcher succeeded Rob Andrew as director of rugby at Newcastle Falcons with immediate effect. Fletcher, a former England A centre, had been the club&#x27;s academy boss and he headed up a team of Peter Walton, Steve Black and Bob Morton, with ex-Falcons prop Ian Peel taking over as acting academy manager.

=== 2007–08 season ===
The season began with high hopes as All-Black prop Carl Hayman signed for the Falcons, reportedly as the highest paid Rugby Union player in the world. Unfortunately, the season was the beginning of a downward spiral for the Falcons. On 11 March 2008, Fletcher and Walton left the club, officially by mutual consent, following Black who had left a couple of months earlier. Steve Bates took over as interim director of rugby until summer 2008 when the post was reviewed. Dave Thompson stated at that time that nine years of underachievement were the reason for the departure of John Fletcher and Peter Walton.

Having said this, Bates guided the Falcons to a record-equalling run of seven consecutive Premiership defeats by April 2008 with home games against Leicester Tigers and London Wasps plus a season-concluding away trip to Worcester Warriors yet to come. Defeat in the European Challenge Cup semi-final against Worcester Warriors on 25 April 2008 may well have sounded the death knell for Steve Bates&#x27; tenure as interim DoR. However, on Tuesday 20 May 2008 Steve Bates was confirmed as Newcastle&#x27;s Director of Rugby on a full-time basis. At the end of the season, fly-half Toby Flood left for Leicester Tigers and full-back Mathew Tait signed for Sale Sharks, as the struggling Falcons failed to hold onto young English international talent. England Saxons scrum-half Lee Dickson would also depart for Northampton Saints, where he would go on to earn full international honours. Legendary Australia full back Matt Burke retired due to injury at the end of the campaign.

=== 2008–09 season ===
In November 2008 Chairman Dave Thompson put an end to speculation of a takeover of the club after rejecting three bids. He held talks with a number of different consortia and reportedly turned down one offer of a full take over as the bidding consortium wanted to relocate the club to Darlington. Furthermore, he said the speculation had led to instability in the club which was unsettling players and fans alike. On the pitch the Falcons reached another European Challenge Cup quarter-final going down to Saracens away from home and finished 10th in the Premiership. This season marked the end of an era as legendary fly-half Jonny Wilkinson left the club for RC Toulonnais. England under-20s fly-half Rory Clegg also left for Harlequins as Jimmy Gopperth was signed as replacement fly-half. The loss of Wilkinson was compounded by the departure of future British and Irish Lions star Geoff Parling who continued the outflow of talent, leaving for Leicester Tigers. Another trio who would go on to achieve England honours in Phil Dowson, Dave Wilson and Tom May also left for Northampton Saints, Bath Rugby and RC Toulonnais respectively.

=== 2009–10 season ===
The Falcons failed to replace the character and quality which had departed, with imports Gcobani Bobo and Filipo Levi flattering to deceive, Gopperth the sole bright spot. After a disappointing season the pressure mounted on Steve Bates and on 4 May 2010, the club announced that Bates&#x27; contract had been terminated and he was being replaced by first team coach Alan Tait.
The decision came after Newcastle went on an unbeaten run to quash any doubts of relegation largely due to an inspirational Carl Hayman. But a crushing home European Challenge Cup Quarter Final defeat by Cardiff Blues signalled the end of the Bates era. Following the loss of England talent Flood, Tait and Wilkinson in previous seasons, the last remaining England international at the club, Jamie Noon, departed for CA Brive. The front line was also notably weakened when club captain Hayman left the Falcons once his lucrative contract expired, to join former teammate Wilkinson at RC Toulonnais.

=== 2010–11 season ===
Towards the end of the previous season Chairman Dave Thompson had to seek investment for the club due to increasing debts following the Nationalisation of Northern Rock, the club&#x27;s main sponsor. After months of speculation, it was announced that local businessman Semore Kurdi had purchased a 40% stake in the club in September 2010, easing the club&#x27;s financial difficulties. Scotland number 8 Ally Hogg was signed, while Scotland and Lions prop Euan Murray also arrived to plug the gap left by Hayman. On the pitch in Alan Tait&#x27;s first season the Falcons reached the Anglo-Welsh Cup final, losing to Gloucester 34–7. Despite this relative success the Falcons finished their worst ever Premiership season with just 23 points (four wins), only escaping relegation thanks to the inferior points difference of Leeds Carnegie. England Saxons pair, scrum-half Micky Young and prop Kieran Brookes, would both depart for Leicester Tigers at the end of the campaign.

=== 2011–12 season: Relegation to Championship ===
The huge outflow of talent from 2008 onwards, and lack of suitable reinforcements, would come to bear during this campaign. Samoa international centre Jamie Helleur was a rare quality signing. The 2011–12 season saw Newcastle Falcons relegated from the Premiership. The Falcons started the season badly but rallied midway through as Gary Gold took over. After changing the set up at Kingston Park, the club nearly escaped relegation, but London Wasps held on to secure their Premiership status by a point. Despite finishing with a higher points total than the year before (32) it was not enough to keep them up. The Falcons still had a small hope that London Welsh may be refused Premiership status, however Welsh were promoted after an appeal. Many players, including Euan Murray, subsequently left the club.

=== 2012–13 season: Repromotion to Premiership ===
The Falcons&#x27; season in the Championship sees the much changed side coached by director of rugby Dean Richards who appointed Will Welch as club captain, while experienced international locks Scott MacLeod and Carlo Del Fava were signed. The Falcons won their first game of the season 37–20 against Bristol and went on to win their second 49–32 against London Scottish. At the halfway point of the season the Falcons were maintaining their unbeaten run, including a 24–13 score against a touring Tongan national side during the first international game to be held at Kingston Park since 1990. Former England Saxons wing Noah Cato signed from Northampton Saints to assist in the promotion push.

The Falcons confirmed their place in the Championship play off semi-final with a bonus point win at home to Cornish Pirates on 22 February 2013 and their position as league leaders was confirmed early the following month. At the conclusion of the season, the Falcons defeated the Bedford Blues 49–33 on aggregate in the final to win promotion back to the Premiership for the 2013–14 season.

=== 2013–14 season ===
Prior to the beginning of the Falcons&#x27; return to the Aviva Premiership, star fly-half Jimmy Gopperth departed for Leinster Rugby. To replace Gopperth, former Falcon Rory Clegg was signed by Dean Richards for the second time, with Richards having previously signed Clegg for Harlequins when Clegg was just 19. Four years later, the return of Clegg, alongside the returning Kieran Brookes from Leicester Tigers, provided evidence that talent was coming back to the Falcons. The signings of former Scotland and Lions scrum-half Mike Blair from CA Brive, Saracens flanker Andy Saull, Scotland hooker Scott Lawson from London Irish, former Scotland fly half Phil Godman and one time France prop Franck Montanella showed the desire of the club to compete upon return to the top flight. Samoa wing Sinoti Sinoti and Argentina centre Gonzalo Tiesi were later added to the squad. Despite a difficult season, which saw a number of retirements through injury, including Carlo Del Fava, the Falcons secured their place in the Aviva Premiership for 2014–15.

=== 2014–15 season ===
The Falcons made a statement ahead of the 2014–15 season with the signing of 2010–11 Premiership top try scorer and three time Premiership winner Alesana Tuilagi. One of Alesana&#x27;s six rugby playing brothers, Andy Tuilagi also signed for the Falcons. Another notable signing was Italy lock Joshua Furno, while Samoa lock Kane Thompson was another new addition. Rotherham Titans duo, Juan Pablo Socino and Ruki Tipuna also joined the club. The Falcons finished the season in 11th place, with a points total of 34.

=== 2015–16 season ===

Ahead of the 2015–16 campaign, England international prop Kieran Brookes and England under-20 lock Dominic Barrow departed for Northampton Saints and Leicester Tigers respectively. Fly halves Rory Clegg and Phil Godman, wing Noah Cato, flanker Andy Saull, scrum halves Mike Blair and Warren Fury along with centre Jamie Helleur were among those released.

A host of 2015 Rugby World Cup stars were signed in Tonga flanker and captain Nili Latu, Tonga scrum half Sonatane Takulua, Italy wing Giovanbattista Venditti and Scotland prop Jon Welsh. The return of former star scrum half Micky Young was also a coup for the Falcons, alongside one time All Black cap, fly half Mike Delany and former England lock Mouritz Botha.

=== 2016–17 season ===

Following seven years in Bath, England prop Dave Wilson returned to the Falcons. Classy France international centre Maxime Mermoz also joined mid-season. Winger Vereniki Goneva had most metres in the Premiership with 1,615 while Mark Wilson received his first England caps.

=== 2017–18 season: &quot;The Big One&quot;, Doddie Weir and a New Era ===

Ahead of the 2017–18 campaign, former England fly-half Toby Flood returned after nine years in Leicester and Toulouse.

On 17 January 2018, the Falcons were presented with a winding up petition by HMRC.

Falcons ended the 2017–18 season in fourth place in the Premiership Rugby table, their highest placing in 20 years. Falcons played Exeter Chiefs at Sandy Park in the semi-finals, where they lost 36–5.. Rob Vickers, Scott Lawson and Ally Hogg all retired following the end of the season after upholding exceptional careers over a decade. Scott Wilson, aged 24 at the time, was forced to retire due to a neck injury he sustained in the semi-final against Exeter. A benefit dinner was held in early 2019 to raise funds for Wilson&#x27;s chosen charity.

=== 2018–19 season: Second Relegation ===
Newcastle keen to follow on from the success of last season expanded their squad with key players such as Logovi&#x27;i Mulipola, John Hardie, Nemani Nagusa and George McGuigan.

Falcons returned to the Heineken Champions Cup after a 13-year absence. They were drawn to play against Toulon, Montpellier and Edinburgh in Pool 5. On 14 October, Falcons started their European Campaign against Toulon at Stade Felix Mayol. Less than 30 seconds into the game and Toulon were already on the board after Romain Taofifénua charged down the kick off and scored a try, one of the quickest tries scored in the history of the competition. In the fourth quarter of the game, three of Toulon&#x27;s players were sin-binned and they were forced to make a decision after being awarded a penalty within kicking distance. However, instead of going for the posts they elected for a five-metre line-out which failed to result in a try. The final score came to 25–26 as Falcons become the second team in a European competition to beat Toulon at home, an accolade that only Saracens had achieved before.

Mark Wilson was announced in Eddie Jones&#x27; Autumn Internationals Squad following players being injured at the time. He started against England&#x27;s 12–11 win over South Africa and won Quilter Internationals player of the series. He became a regular starter for England in the 2019 Six Nations along with Gary Graham making his debut for Scotland.

Following the success of the previous &quot;The Big One&quot;, Falcons announced on 4 December that their match against northern rivals Sale Sharks would be played at Newcastle United&#x27;s St. James&#x27; Park. The match would be held as a Charity Event in aid of Doddie Weir and the My Name’5 Doddie foundation. ISC incorporated the ‘Doddie’5 Tartan’ into the shoulders of the Charity Jersey along with the Famous Black and White stripes representing the iconic colours worn by Newcastle United. The match was a success with 27,284 spectators present as Newcastle beat Sale 22–17.

Falcons confirmed the signing of United States international Greg Peterson in mid-March with Darren Barry, Josh Basham, Gareth Owen and Toby Salmon following shortly after. Tongan international Cooper Vuna later signed a 2-year deal with the club. They also announced a 5-year deal with sportswear brand Macron to provide official kits and leisurewear as their official supplier.

On 4 May, it was confirmed that Newcastle Falcons would be relegated to the RFU Championship after failing to beat Gloucester away. After this, many prominent players elected to leave the club to further pursue top-flight rugby. Following the confirmation of relegation into the Championship, Simon Hammersley and Chris Harris both evoked relegation release clauses held within their contracts and signed for Sale Sharks and Gloucester Rugby respectively. Wasps picked up Zach Kibirige with Director of Rugby Dai Young saying Kibirige was &quot;simply too good an opportunity to miss&quot;. England International Mark Wilson signed a 1-year loan agreement with Sale Sharks which would ultimately allow him to still play for his country despite being registered to a Championship team. Finally on 3 July, it was announced that fan favourite Vereniki Goneva had signed for Harlequins following rumours and speculation on where he would go following Falcons&#x27; demotion. He signed along with fellow Fijian international Tevita Cavubati and Newcastle teammate Glen Young.

=== 2019–20 season: Greene King Championship and the COVID-19 Pandemic ===

Keen to start the new season in the right direction, Falcons bolstered their Premiership side against every team they faced in the competition winning every match both home and away, their largest win being 41–0 against Bedford Blues on 14 March 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the RFU officially cancelled the season on 20 March 2020, after initially postponing all rugby in England. As a result, Newcastle Falcons were declared champions for the season and promoted back into the Premiership on the basis of their playing record having been undefeated and at the top of the table when the league was suspended. The club made a series of salary reductions for players and off-field staff to ensure the survival of the company during an unprecedented time, this included all branches of the club including Newcastle Thunder and the team&#x27;s charity branch, Newcastle Falcons Foundation.

It was also at this time that Johnny Williams announced he would be moving to Scarlets at the official conclusion of the season with Dominic Waldouck joining Gloucester Rugby as their Defence Coach. Nick Easter also joined Falcons&#x27; coaching squad shortly after.

=== 2020–21 season: Post-Pandemic revival ===

After a wait of 8 months, Rugby Union restarted across England with teams cautiously returning to some level of normality. Newcastle, back in the Premiership, expanded and strengthened its squad with the flagship signing of Luther Burrell following a cross-code switch from Warrington Wolves. Home grown talent Gary Graham and Jamie Blamire both signed 3-year contract extensions respectively. Sinoti Sinoti, a fan favourite at the club who was a key asset in the Falcons&#x27; previous seasons left the club owing to &quot;Personal Reasons&quot;.

=== 2021–22 season: RFU Investigation into Institutionalised Racism ===

On 25 June 2022 the Daily Mail interviewed player Luther Burrell highlighting racism in his rugby playing career, specifically mentioning how it had become commonplace in the Newcastle Falcons team. Burrell had been the target of racist remarks between teammates who brushed it off as . The club launched an internal investigation following the story breaking with Luther receiving public support for his actions with many fans of the club and the Rugby Union community condemning the claims stated in the article. The Rugby Football Union announced on 24 July that they would conduct a full independent investigation into the allegations made by Burrell.

Newcastle finished the 2021-22 Premiership Rugby season in 12th place, entitling them to play in the 2022-23 European Rugby Challenge Cup.

=== 2022-23 season ===

Newcastle Falcons finished bottom of the table in the 2022-23 season, 10 points behind Gloucester.

=== 2023-24 season ===

Newcastle Falcons finished bottom of the table in the 2023-24 season, without winning a single match.

=== 2024-25 season ===
On 18 October 2024, Newcastle Falcons ended their 25-match losing streak in the 2024–25 Premiership Rugby season with a victory over Exeter Chiefs, with this being their first league victory since March 2023. On 29 November 2024, they would climb off the bottom of the table beating Saracens 17–12 at home. This was their first win over them since 2009. Having endured a run of many consecutive loses, by this point they had won five of their last six games in all competitions.

== Club information ==
=== Stadium ===
Newcastle Falcons play at Kingston Park which holds 10,250. Kingston Park was the second smallest stadium in the Premiership Rugby with the club&#x27;s average attendance currently sitting at approximately 10,000, a 42.5% increase from the 2016–17 season and a 96.8% increase from the 2013–14 season. The stadium has three modern stands; the open air North standing Terrace, the enclosed South Stand Terrace – where the loudest fans traditionally stand and sing, and the all-seated West Stand. However, the Falcons also retain the original Gosforth East stand complete with green and white seating (Gosforth colours). The pitch at Kingston Park recently went under renovation, replacing the former grass surface with a 3G Synthetic pitch with the aim of reducing the matches lost to the North East weather. In June 2015, the Falcons bought Kingston Park back from Northumbria University, which was a bold statement by the club ahead of the 2015–16 season.

On 16 September 2017 the Falcons played a home game away from Kingston Park and become the second English team to host a game in the United States when they faced Saracens at the Talen Energy Stadium in Philadelphia.

On 24 March 2018 Newcastle Falcons hosted &quot;&quot;The Big One&quot;, their Premiership fixture against Northampton Saints. It was originally booked to be played at Kingston Park but after an agreement came together with Newcastle United F.C., it was moved to St James&#x27; Park, Newcastle United&#x27;s home ground. The goal was to promote rugby union in North East England while also being the Falcons&#x27; biggest home crowd to date. The bar was set at 20,000 attendees which would beat their previous record of 11,595 set in 1999 when a match was held at Gateshead International Stadium. For the match, Falcons wore a unique black and white striped shirt similar to that worn by Newcastle United. It was announced after &quot;The Big One&quot;&quot; game that 30,174 people attended the game as Falcons beat Northampton Saints 25–22. It was the first Premiership Rugby match to be played at St James&#x27; Park, and the success of the initiative led to Newcastle Falcons doing the same in the 2018–2019 season.

<text>The Regni (also the Regini or the Regnenses) were a Celtic tribe or group of tribes living in Britain prior to the Roman Conquest, and later a civitas or canton of Roman Britain. They lived in what is now Sussex, as well as small parts of Hampshire, Surrey and Kent, with their tribal heartland at Noviomagus Reginorum (modern Chichester).

==Territory==
It is generally accepted that the Regni broadly occupied the region that later became Sussex. Surrey is sometimes included within Regni territory and sometimes within the territory of the Atrebates to the north. However the archeological record north of the Weald shows significant differences to the south and so it would appear Surrey was not normally included in the Regni tribal area.

The tribe was surrounded on the west by the Belgae, on the north by the Atrebates, and on the east by the Cantiaci. To the south and east across the &quot;Oceanus Britannicus&quot; or &quot;Oceanus Gallicus&quot; (the present day English Channel) lay Gaul and the tribal areas of the Caletes, Veliocasses, Catuslugi, Ambiani and the Morini.

==Name==
The tribe’s existence is traced to the city of Chichester. During the Roman era, Chichester served as a ‘Civitas’ Capital, indicating it was a minor capital city governing a small tribal region. While maps typically indicate the Atrebates as the tribe occupying Chichester, the name of the city suggests the Regini actually controlled the area.

Chichester&#x27;s Roman name, &#x27;Noviomagus Reginorum,&#x27; is widely accepted to translate as ‘New Market,’ but the meaning of &#x27;Reginorum&#x27; has been a subject of debate. Originally interpreted as ‘The People of the Kingdom,&#x27; i.e. the people of Cogidubnus&#x27;s client kingdom, a comparison with other civitas capitals reveals a different meaning. For instance, the tribal capital of the Durotriges tribe in Dorset (Dorchester) is &#x27;Durotrigium,&#x27; corresponding to the land of the Duro(triges). This naming convention is also seen in other regional capitals like Atrebatum (Silchester) within Atrebates territory and Belgarum (Winchester) in Belgae territory. Applying this pattern to Chichester suggests that ‘Reginorum’ should be understood as ‘New Market, Land of the Regini.’ Regnini or Regni is believed to come from a Brythonic word &quot;Regini&quot; (and the Gaulish and Old Welsh word &quot;Regin&quot;) meaning the &#x27;proud ones&#x27; or the &#x27;stiff ones&#x27;.

The name of this people is not entirely certain. Ptolemy refers to the , in Latin &quot;Regni&quot;, whose only city was , &quot;Noiomagus&quot;. This appears to be the same place as &quot;Navimago Regentium&quot; or &quot;Noviomagus Regionorum&quot;, from which &quot;Regnenses&quot;, occurring in some modern sources, appears to be derived. The location is generally supposed to be Chichester. The Antonine Itinerary refers to a place called &quot;Regno&quot; at the end of Roman Road 7, perhaps referring to a site along the coast of the Solent. Some scholars reject &quot;Regnenses&quot; in favour of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Regni&quot; or a Brythonic name &quot;Regini&quot;.

==Background==
By the Middle Iron Age (c. 250 BC) the first millenium BC hillforts on the northern and southern edges of the South Downs, such as Chanctonbury Ring and Highdown Hill had fallen out of use, replaced by new, smaller number of more dramatic hillforts on the Downs, such as at the Caburn, Cissbury and the Trundle. Unlike in the region of Wessex to the west, settlement close to these hillforts was limited. These hillforts were probably built to be impressive monuments rather than defensive structures, uniting local communities and giving them a renewed sense of identity. Also at this time, the coastal plain to the west of modern-day Brighton was resettled. By the end of the Middle Iron Age (c. 100BC) the downland hillforts had been abandoned, and settlements on the coastal plain became more numerous.

==Late Iron Age (c. 100 BC - early 1st century)==
The Regni were probably a group of native tribes influenced by the Belgae. The sudden appearance of new coin designs hints that some tribes in south-eastern Britain might have been under the control of a Belgic elite and adopted aspects of their culture as early as 100 - 80 BC. The distribution of Aylesford-Swarling pottery in south-eastern Britain has also been associated with the Belgae; however, recent studies proposed that migration might not have played as significant a role as once thought, with increased trade connections being more important, although this remains uncertain.

The Regni entered a period of historical documentation around 75 BC, with the emergence of written records and the rise of a literate society, accompanied by a more complex economic system. Various groups&#x27; movements were no longer tracked solely through pottery artefacts but also through the identification of coins, marking a level of literacy, the aggregation of core cultures in specific regions, and the introduction of monetary transactions for trading surplus goods. Driven by pressures from tribal factions on the Continent and the Romans&#x27; continued conquests in Gaul, rebellious groups set out across the sea in search of unoccupied lands, especially where local chieftains resisted Roman rule. This likely marked the initial &#x27;invasion&#x27; of Sussex, although detailed accounts of battles and conquests are scarce. The Gallo-Belgic tribes, also known as Celts, integrated their dominance into the existing social structure rather than replacing it; even during the later Roman era, indigenous Neolithic inhabitants coexisted with Iron Age urban residents in Sussex. Significant newcomers like Commius of the Atrebates, who sought sanctuary in Britain around 52 BC, brought and promoted a level of civilisation influenced by Rome. The Atrebates settled across a wide area encompassing Hampshire, Wiltshire, and parts of eastern Sussex, with some falling under the rule of the Catuvellauni by 25 BC.

Following the initial &#x27;conquest&#x27; and subsequent power shifts, Sussex stabilised into a new order. The influence of the Atrebates extended toward the Ouse and partially into the Weald, while tribes in the northeast and Kent maintained a more defensive stance, with Mount Caburn being a strongly fortified boundary town. The new ruling class notably abandoned the large developed hill-forts at the Trundle and Cissbury in favour of sophisticated urban centres on the coastal plain. This was particularly in the Selsey-Chichester area, which has since succumbed to coastal erosion.

The settlements of the Regni tribe are mapped out in the West Sussex region, particularly situated around the River Lavant and between the river systems of the Arun and Adur. Noteworthy is the Major Oppidum (City) located in Chichester, along with the Selsey/Mixon rocks. It&#x27;s believed that the Cymenshore/Mixon rocks were submerged around the 7th or 8th century AD, Large iron age shrine/votive site, also of significance is the Romano-Belgic Palace found at Fishbourne, which included a coin mint and shrine at Ratham, alongside ironworks at Boxgrove. The discovery of the Mystery Atrebate Warrior and the burial of the North Bersted Man at Bersted contribute to the historical narrative or the Regini. 

Trade and fishing activities were prevalent at a small enclosure in Pagham, while Climping was recognised as a major trade centre. Coldharbour at the mouth of the Arun yielded a Roman hoard along with gold and silver Celtic coins. The Romano-Belgic Villa at Bognor and another trade centre at Tortington also produced gold and silver Celtic numismatics. Arundel served as a large Iron Age population centre, with substantial enclosures at Rewell Wood nearby, which during the late Bronze Age, was one of the largest settlements in Europe. There was a Romano-Belgic Villa at Bignor, and at Coldharbour, south of Stoke, a small quantity of silver Celtic coins was found.

Various settlement enclosures at Warningcamp may be linked to the Rewell Wood tribes, while the Burpham vicinity yielded Iron Age artefacts along with bone fragments from burials and signs of earthworks. The trade inlet at Nutbourne and Bosham, located at Chichester Harbour, also produced gold and silver Celtic coins. Wittering, which is now submerged, served as another trade centre at Chichester Harbour inlet, while Tournerbury hill fort is positioned approximately 100 metres from the Solent shoreline on nearby Hayling Island, just over the modern border with Hampshire, where Iron Age and Roman pottery have been discovered.

Rowlands Castle has shown evidence of Romano-British pottery, bricks, and tiles, benefiting from the nearby availability of suitable clay. Goosehill Camp features multiple enclosure hillforts situated on sloping grounds just below the ridge summit of the Sussex Downs. The Apple Down/Kingley Vale Ancient Forest is known as one of the oldest forests in Europe, containing yew trees that are up to 2,000 years old—some of the oldest living organisms in Great Britain.

The Trundle hillfort is found on the notable St. Roche&#x27;s Hill, recognised as one of the prominent hills along the southern edge of the Sussex Downs. In Chilgrove, Bronze Age and Roman earthworks, cross dykes, and an ancient field system were established. Funtington features Coldharbour trade activities along the River Lavant, along with earthworks, cross dykes, a camp, and a field system, while a small quantity of gold and silver Celtic coins was discovered. Keynor was identified as an inland trade point that has since become silted.

The Regni expanded into the Weald, engaging not only in agriculture but also in exploiting iron resources crucial for their weaponry and tools. Archaeological remains of these industrial sites indicate a growing division of labour before the Roman period, alongside a developing hierarchy among tribal leaders who adopted somewhat Roman lifestyles while establishing a relative peace in their territories. Textile production preceded leatherwork as the primary industry, supported by the presence of salt producers along the Selsey coast, indicating a thriving trading economy that raised the standard of living for the ruling elite. They introduced cremation practices and organised burial sites to replace earlier native burial customs, though their involvement with the powerful Druidic cults of the late Iron Age remains uncertain. Information on the social customs of the Atrebates is limited and subject to potential biases from certain Roman chroniclers.

Descriptions by Tacitus portray the south-eastern Britons as having similarities with their Gaulish counterparts: valiant yet hesitant in battle, fond of adorning themselves with woad, and possibly open to polyandry, though the accuracy of this claim is ambiguous. Julius Caesar&#x27;s depiction of the Britons aligns well with the idea of the Regini tribe influenced by Belgic culture. The inland areas of Britain were inhabited by people claiming native heritage, while coastal regions were populated by migrants from Belgium who arrived to engage in warfare. These individuals often took names from their states of origin and settled after conflicts, integrating into agricultural practices. The island sustained a substantial population, featuring structures reminiscent of Gaul, and abundant livestock. The coastal territories of the Manhood Peninsula fit this description well, supported by Numismatics and Belgic influences.

This central area likely served as the heart of the Belgic-influenced Regni tribe, stretching from the boundaries of Hampshire to the Trisantona Fluvius (the River Arun), meeting the English Channel at Littlehampton. The tribes outside this core area in the Sussex Weald were likely predominantly indigenous Brythonic communities who interacted with the Belgic-influenced Britons along the West Sussex coast. Regini, appearing to have been predominantly influenced by the Atrebates, could have been either a branch of the Belgic Atrebates or part of a confederation of smaller tribes predating the Atrebates&#x27; presence in Sussex and Hampshire. Despite seemingly avoiding complete submission to the Atrebates and maintaining some autonomy, their close ties to them were apparent, with Noviomagus serving as an early capital for the Atrebates, strategically positioned near a coastal area convenient for Celtic migrations from the mainland.

Situated geographically along the southern coast of Britain, they likely assimilated more advanced practices and traded with Continental tribes until the Roman conquest of Gaul. The Regni, in conjunction with the Atrebates, seemingly saw Rome as a chance to enhance their commerce in opulent textiles, hunting dogs, and Iron goods, thus encouraging a reciprocal exchange of concepts that enriched their culture and technology, potentially giving them an advantage over less developed neighbouring tribes. It is likely that the Regni were among the most assimilated British tribes to Roman culture. They had already developed trade relationships with Rome, maintaining a Roman trading post and a small Roman influence even prior to the Roman conquest in AD 43. The Romans&#x27; significant utilization of Chichester Harbour within the Regni&#x27;s lands right after AD 43 indicates that the Regni&#x27;s supportive ties with Rome allowed the Romans an avenue to provide resources to the Roman legions operating in the south-west of Britain.

Excavations in North Bersted, Oldplace Farm, and Copse Farm uncovered remnants of late Iron Age farmsteads and complex field systems, indicating widespread agricultural activities along the coastal plains. Archaeological investigations on Selsey Island revealed minimal late Iron Age or Roman remains, suggesting that while the area may have been inundated during that period, it was not a main settlement area. The presence of numerous Iron Age gold coins at Selsey Bill may suggest ritual offerings in the marshlands and even into the sea.

==Client kingdom (early-late 1st century)==
It has been suggested that, after the first phase of the conquest, the Romans maintained a nominally independent client kingdom, perhaps acting as a buffer between the Roman province in the east and the unconquered tribes to the west. There has been some debate about the extent of this territory, whose ruler was Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus or Cogidumnus.

The only tribal area Cogidubnus definitely ruled was the Regni. Tacitus says &quot;&quot; (&#x27;certain were given to King Cogidumnus&#x27;) and remarks on his loyalty. Some have assumed that Cogidubnus must also have ruled over the civitates of the Belgae and the Atrebates, while Miles Russell has suggested that the kingdom could have extended northwards to the south and east Midlands, and westwards to Bath. John Creighton not only takes the view that the kingdom extended to the Midlands, he also argues that Cogidubdus&#x27; predecessors, formed a Southern dynasty of kings, ruling what was a Roman client kingdom from the early 1st century.

A first century inscription found in Chichester supplies his Latin names, indicating he was given Roman citizenship by Claudius or Nero. Cogidubnus may have been a relative of Verica, the Atrebatian king whose overthrow was the excuse for the conquest. After Cogidubnus&#x27;s death, the kingdom would have been incorporated into the directly ruled Roman province and divided into its constituent , such as the Regni, Atrebates and Belgae.

===Controversies===
Likewise, the theory that Cogidubnus was created , a rank only ever given to senators, is based on reconstructing the damaged Chichester inscription to read as &quot;Cogidubni regis legati Augusti in Britannia&quot; (&#x27;king and imperial legate in Britain&#x27;). It more probably reads &quot;Cogidubni regis magni Britanniae&quot; (&#x27;great king of Britain&#x27;).

==Roman &quot;civitas&quot; (late 1st century—c.410 AD) ==

After the death of Cogidubnus around 80 AD, the region became part of the Roman Empire proper. Governed as a Roman civitas, with its capital at Noviomagus, the region had several ports, Roman roads and villas. The key roads include the route north-east from Noviomagus which crossed the Thames at what became Londinium (modern-day London), known to the Saxons as Stane Street. Running east from Noviomagus was a route to Novus Portus (probably modern-day Portslade) and to the north-west ran a route to Calleva Atrebatum (modern Silchester), the capital of the neighbouring civitas of the Atrebates. Another route connected modern-day Lewes to Londinium. The Sussex Greensand Way connected the Chichester-London and Lewes-London routes.

Following raids across both sides of the English Channel in the late 3rd century, the Romans established the a series of forts across both sides of the Channel, including the fort of Anderitum (modern Pevensey) in the civitas of the Regni.

There was a large iron-producing industry in the vast forest known as the &quot;Sylva Anderida&quot; (the modern Weald). This included the 3rd -largest works in the entire Roman Empire, at Beauport Park near Hastings.

==Post-Roman era (c. 410 AD - 7th century) ==

Following the departure of Roman troops to Gaul in 407, Roman rule in Britain came to an end. In the former civitas of the Regni, the Kingdom of Sussex began its formation over the next half-century, traditionally with the arrival over the sea of King Aelle and his three sons in 477 AD, although Aelle&#x27;s existence is debated and the South Saxon arrivals probably closer to 450 AD. A hoard of Roman coins, now known as the Patching Hoard, was deposited around 475 AD, the latest in Britain.

According to Michael Shapland, it is likely that the western area of the Regni canton, lying to the west of the River Arun, continued to have a Celtic British culture for many decades, even after the establishment of the Kingdom of Sussex, perhaps as a related kingdom or sub-kingdom. Some of the kings of Sussex have Celtic names, such as Æthelwealh. The choice of Selsey Abbey, on what was at the time the island of Selsey, had more in common with the ancient Christian centres of Lindisfarne, Glastonbury and Iona, all in areas where post-Roman Celtic kingdoms continued. Sussex&#x27;s cathedral would appear to have more in common with the Celtic British Church and indicate Celtic origins.

==Religion==

===Paganism===
There is a notable concentration of shrines in the region, notably at Hayling Island, Lancing Down and Westhampnett. There was also a temple at Chanctonbury Ring which may have been part of a cult of the wild boar.

Cremation was established in the Regni tribal area by the 70s BC, even earlier in the major cemetery at Westhampnett.

====Goddesses of the Regni====
In south-eastern Britain, original coin designs have been found that skillfully combine Roman official symbols, featuring the likeness of the goddess Roma on the coins issued by the Regni tribe in West Sussex. These symbols reveal the self-perception of the Regni rulers, shedding light on historical political occurrences of the past. The representation of Roma we are examining is a blend influenced by Hellenistic artistic styles, crafted for the Roman denarius in 211 BC. It encapsulates Rome as a political entity, comprising the city, state, citizenship, origin, and the essence of Roman expansion. Categorised differently from conventional goddesses such as Diana or Minerva, Roma was not associated with sacred tales or ancient Indo-European gods. The helmeted Roman figure of Roma was inspired by Diana and Minerva but stands out due to its distinctive attributes like the Attic helmet adorned with a gryphon crest and tendrils extending to wings.

Engravers in Gaul and Britain selectively integrated these specific features. The depiction of &quot;Roma&quot; by the Regni tribe in Britain incorporates regional elements, akin to the similarity observed between Roma in Rome and the goddesses Diana and Minerva.

The Commios Ladder head silver units (30 - 45 BC) depict a Celtic fertility Goddess with unique features like a lentoid eye, swollen cheeks, and a bulbous chin. Her long flowing hair resembles moons, possibly representing a Luna deity. Circular Goat Horns hover above her head, and a flower is positioned in front of her, as though she is either smelling it or whispering to it. The symbols surrounding the goddess hold unknown meanings. Rotating the coin reveals a clear image of a Snake. This intricate design combines a lunar goddess with a horned serpent, likely Cernunnos, depicting the Great Queen of the Atrebates and Regni alongside the horned serpent. This fusion symbolises her diverse identity and authoritative position.

The Selsey Diadem gold quarter stater (55-50 BC) features a goddess with a diadem adorned with a moon symbol and two twisted locks of hair by her ears. The coin also depicts a horse and foal, along with a wheel and quatrefoil flower on the front. Moon-crowns were not exclusive to the Regini tribe. Roman Republican denarii depict female heads with crescent diadems, similar to modern tiaras. A denarius from 56BC with a diadem and a small moon above it may have inspired the Regini Selsey Diadem. Epona, a Gallo-Roman deity associated with horses, was believed to guide souls in the afterlife, resembling the depiction of Rhiannon in the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;. Rhiannon, like Epona, is often shown with her son Pryderi as a mare and foal, linking her to the Gaulish horse deity Epona.

The Sussex Helmet silver unit dating from 60-20 BC shows a Goddess with a helmet, possibly a prototype Roma due to the rarity of such portrayals. Within the British setting, depictions of Roma likely combined with local religious symbols, highlighting distinct characteristics. The god worshipped by the Regini community might be tied to the Roman goddess Minerva, as hinted by an inscription on a stone found at a shrine dedicated to Neptune and Minerva in Noviomagus Reginorum, now Chichester.

The Ashdown Forest Helmet Silver unit (50-40 BC) shows a goddess in a helmet with horns and boar-bristled crest, along with a large lentoid eye similar to the bronze helmet discovered near Waterloo Bridge in the Thames. It seems that the Romas Greco-Roman Attic helmet, which had a gryphon crest, has been replaced by a local style helmet. The delicate bronze Waterloo Bridge helmet was probably not suited for combat but rather for ceremonial purposes, much like ancient bronze shields mainly used for display rather than protection. Some believe its small size indicates it may have decorated a wooden statue of a Celtic deity.

Dating back to 55-45 BC, the Sussex Lyre silver unit features a portrayal of a Diademed goddess head with a distinctive pointed nose, wearing a neck torc and curly hair, possibly representing Trisantona, linked to the River Arun. On the reverse side, a horse with a zigzag tail, spoked wheel, and a unique lyre is depicted. While ancient Celtic lyre details are limited, it was used by Celtic bards from the 8th century BC and was later called the lyra during the Roman period. Made largely of wood with bone elements, the lyre had animal intestine strings in its resonator. Despite probably adopting it from the Greeks, the Gauls and other Celtic groups valued the crwth (Lyra) as a symbol of their musical heritage. The Gauls and Britons associated the instrument with their religious customs, using it in rituals and hymns for their tribal deities.

The Chichester Goddess Silver unit (50-30 BC) depicts a unique Goddess with distinct features including an oval eye, long pointed nose, thin lips, round prominent chin, slender curved neck, and flowing hair locks. She wears a honeycomb diadem and a duck visor helmet with a duck head and serpent-like creature. Ducks in Celtic mythology symbolise femininity, divinity, and otherworldly powers, linked to the goddess Sequana and the River Seine. The obverse side portrays a triple-tailed horse with a linear mane galloping with a boar below, associated with Moccus, the boar god of the Lingones tribe. Boar meat was sacred to the ancient Celts, reflecting in Celtic feasts. Lingones were a Gaulish tribe based near the Seine and Marne rivers in northeastern France, neighboring the Celto-Germanic Treveri tribe. Another Lingones tribe in north eastern Italy specialized in agriculture, weaving, and metalworking.

The Regini transformed the abstraction of a civitas personification into a concrete and symbolic entity. This transition highlights how a personified civitas could take on ceremonial and narrative significance. British Brigantia represents one instance of this type of development, while the Icenian personification could be another. In a parallel vein, even the Romans sanctioned a similar evolution by erecting an altar to Roma and Augustus in Lugdunum (Lyon) in 10 BC during Augustus’ reign to act as the focal point of the imperial cult for the three Gallic provinces.

Throughout the 1st century BC, several Gaulish authorities minted silver quinarius coins featuring the head of Roma. Subtle variations differentiate these local depictions from the original image, suggesting their adoption to convey regional significance. For instance, a Gallic torc necklace might be added, the gryphon crest on Roma&#x27;s helm could be altered or removed entirely, such as in the case of replacing it with a horsehair or boar-bristle crest in Britain. Additionally, explicit wings might be absent or substituted with a different linear design.
In the 1st century BC, various Gallic leaders minted silver quinarius coins featuring a depiction of Roma. These local adaptations of Roma&#x27;s image included unique elements such as the addition of a Gallic torc necklace and the replacement of Romas gryphon crest with symbols like a horsehair or boar-bristle crest. Some coins also omitted the wings or substituted them with different designs.

It is important to note that all the coins shown were produced prior to 50 BC by affluent and well-organized allies of the Roman state. The Aedui, Sequani, and Lingones underwent political transformations early in the 1st century BC, implementing oligarchic structures similar to those of the Roman administration. Julius Caesar and his successors referred to the Gallic tribes as civitates, the Latin term for organized political entities or states. Similarly, the helmeted head on Roman coins symbolized the civitas Romana, the Roman state. Like the Gauls, the creators of British coin images made a clear distinction between abstract state symbols and depictions of powerful protective goddesses. The depiction of the Roma goddess by the Regini and Iceni resembles a cult image, possibly representing a British equivalent to deities like Diana/Artemis or Minerva/Pallas Athene.

The use of Roman symbolism on Gaulish and British coins reflects a desire to project themselves as autonomous political entities equal to the Roman state. Coin design often coincided with political transformations and administrative reforms, and the adoption of Roman imagery suggests the emergence of tribal leagues, larger kingdoms, and oligarchic states. The coins produced during this period indicate that groups like the Regini, Belgae, East Wiltshire groups, and Iceni may have viewed themselves as a confederation with shared ceremonial institutions, united by a collective identity and legal system. The word for a People or tribal state in Gaul and Britain at that time, Teuta or Touta, was a feminine noun, similar to the Latin Civitas, allowing for personification as a female deity. Just as Roma personified the Roman Civitas, the adapted image of Roma on Gallic and British coins likely represented the existence of a comparable citizen body, Civitas or Teuta.

===Christianity===
Following the Edict of Thessalonica in 380 AD, Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire. At Wiggonholt, on a tributary of the River Arun, a large lead tank with repeated chi-rho motifs was discovered in 1943, the only Roman period artefact in Sussex found with a definite Christian association. It may represent a baptismal font or a container for holy water, or alternatively may have been used by pagans.

<doc id="471799" wikidata="Q1034413" url="?curid=471799" title="Cape Fear (headland)">
<text>Cape Fear is a prominent headland jutting into the Atlantic Ocean from Bald Head Island on the coast of North Carolina in the southeastern United States. It is largely formed of barrier beaches and the silty outwash of the Cape Fear River as it drains the southeast coast of North Carolina through an estuary south of Wilmington. Cape Fear is formed by the intersection of two sweeping arcs of shifting, low-lying beach, the result of longshore currents which also form the treacherous, shifting Frying Pan Shoals, part of the Graveyard of the Atlantic.

Dunes dominated by sea oats occur from the upper beach drift line back to the stable secondary dunes, where they mix with other grasses such as saltmeadow cordgrass and panic grass, as well as seaside goldenrod, spurge and other herbs to form a stable salt-tolerant grassland.

The Cape Fear estuary drains the largest watershed in North Carolina, containing 27% of the state&#x27;s population.

==History==
Giovanni da Verrazzano, the Italian explorer sailing for France, made landfall after crossing the Atlantic at or near Cape Fear on March 1, 1524.

The name comes from the 1585 expedition of Sir Richard Grenville. Sailing to Roanoke Island, his ship became embayed behind the cape. Some of the crew were afraid they would wreck, giving rise to the name Cape Fear. It is the fifth-oldest surviving English place name in the U.S.

Cape Fear was the landing place of British General Sir Henry Clinton during the American Revolutionary War on May 3, 1775.

The 1962 film &quot;Cape Fear&quot; and its 1991 remake were set at Cape Fear (although neither movie actually was filmed there).

<doc id="471806" wikidata="Q311440" url="?curid=471806" title="António Guterres">
<text>António Manuel de Oliveira Guterres (; ; born 30 April 1949) is a Portuguese politician and diplomat who is serving as the ninth and current secretary-general of the United Nations since 2017. A member of the Portuguese Socialist Party, Guterres served as the prime minister of Portugal from 1995 to 2002. 

Guterres served as secretary-general of the Socialist Party from 1992 to 2002. He was elected prime minister in 1995 and announced his resignation in 2002, after his party was defeated in the 2001 Portuguese local elections. After six years governing without an absolute majority and with a poor economy, the Socialist Party did worse than expected because of losses in Lisbon and Porto, where polls indicated they had a solid lead. Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues assumed the Socialist Party leadership in January 2002, but Guterres would remain as prime minister until the general election was lost to the Social Democratic Party, led by José Manuel Barroso. Despite this defeat, polling of the Portuguese public in both 2012 and 2014 ranked Guterres the best prime minister of the previous 30 years.

He served as President of the Socialist International from 1999 to 2005, and was the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees from 2005 to 2015. Guterres was elected secretary-general in October 2016, succeeding Ban Ki-moon at the beginning of the following year and becoming the first European to hold this office since Kurt Waldheim in 1981.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Guterres was born in parish of Santos-o-Velho, in the municipality of Lisbon, Portugal, the son of Virgílio Dias Guterres (1913–2009) and Ilda Cândida dos Reis Oliveira Guterres (1923–2021).

He attended the Camões Lyceum (now Camões Secondary School), where he graduated in 1965, winning the National Lyceums Award (&quot;Prémio Nacional dos Liceus&quot;) as the best student in the country. He studied physics and electrical engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico – Technical University of Lisbon in Lisbon. He graduated in 1971 and started an academic career as an assistant professor teaching systems theory and telecommunications signals, before leaving academic life to start a political career. During his university years, he joined the Group of Light, a club for young Catholics, where he met Father Vítor Melícias, a prominent Franciscan priest and church administrator who remains a close friend and confidant.

==Political career==
Guterres&#x27;s political career began in 1974, when he became a member of the Socialist Party. Shortly thereafter, he quit academic life and became a full-time politician. In the period following the Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974 that put an end to Caetano&#x27;s dictatorship, Guterres became involved in Socialist Party leadership and held the following offices:
* Head of Office of the Secretary of State of Industry (1974 and 1975)
* Deputy for Castelo Branco in the Portuguese National Parliament (1976–2002)
* Leader of the parliamentary bench of the Socialist Party, succeeding Jorge Sampaio (1989–1990)

Guterres was a member of the team that negotiated the terms of Portugal&#x27;s entry into the European Union in the late 1970s. He was a founding member of the Portuguese Refugee Council in 1991.

In 1992, after the Socialists&#x27; third consecutive defeat in Parliamentary elections, Guterres became secretary-general of the Socialist Party and leader of the opposition during Aníbal Cavaco Silva&#x27;s government. At the time, he was the party&#x27;s third leader in six years. He was also selected as one of the 25 vice presidents of the Socialist International in September 1992.

His election represented a break with tradition for the Socialists: not only was Guterres not associated with either the faction around then-president and former prime minister Mário Soares or the party&#x27;s left wing led by Guterres&#x27;s predecessor Sampaio, but he was also a devout Catholic, running counter to the party&#x27;s historical secularism. He consulted with Portugal&#x27;s civil society in formulating policy, meeting a range of intellectuals, scientists and entrepreneurs from across the country and the political spectrum in the run-up to the next general election.

===Prime minister of Portugal===
Aníbal Cavaco Silva did not seek a fourth term as prime minister of Portugal (in order to run for the 1996 presidential election) and the Socialist Party won the 1995 parliamentary election. President Soares appointed Guterres as prime minister and his cabinet took the oath of office on 28 October that year.

Guterres ran on a platform of keeping a tight hold on budget spending and inflation in a bid to ensure that Portugal met the Euro convergence criteria by the end of the decade, as well as increasing rates of participation in the labor market, especially among women, improving tax collection and cracking down on tax evasion, increased involvement of the mutual and nonprofit sectors in providing welfare services, a means-tested guaranteed minimum income (known as the &quot;Rendimento Mínimo Garantido&quot;), and increased investment in education. He was then one of seven Social Democratic prime ministers in the European Union, joining political allies in Spain, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Greece and the Netherlands.

====First term (1995–1999)====

With a style markedly different from that of his predecessor, and based on dialogue and discussion with all sections of society, Guterres was a popular prime minister in his first years in office. Portugal was enjoying an economic expansion that allowed the Socialists to reduce budget deficits while increasing welfare spending and creating new conditional cash transfer programs. His government also accelerated the program of privatizations that Cavaco Silva&#x27;s government had begun: 29 companies were privatized between 1996 and 1999, with proceeds from privatizations in 1996–97 greater than those of the previous six years, and the public sector&#x27;s share of GDP halved from 11% in 1994 to 5.5% five years later. Share ownership was also widened, with 800,000 people investing in Portugal Telecom upon its privatization in 1996 and 750,000 applying for shares in Electricidade de Portugal.

In 1998, Guterres presided over Expo 98 in Lisbon, commemorating the 500th anniversary of the voyage of Vasco da Gama. Also in 1998, two nationwide referendums were held. The first one was held in June and asked voters whether abortion rules should be liberalized. The Socialist Party split over the issue of liberalization, and Guterres led the anti-abortion side, which eventually won the referendum. A second referendum was held in November, this time over the regionalization of the mainland. Both Guterres and his party supported such an administrative reform, but the voters rejected it.

Contrary to his party&#x27;s stance and following the removal of homosexuality from the list of mental illnesses by the World Health Organization in 1990, Guterres said, in 1995, that &quot;he did not like homosexuality&quot; and that it was &quot;something that bothered him&quot;.

On foreign policy, Guterres campaigned for United Nations intervention in East Timor in 1999, after it was virtually destroyed by Indonesian-backed militias when it voted for independence. He also finalized the 12-year negotiations on the transfer of sovereignty over Macau, which had been a Portuguese colony, to Chinese control in 1999.

====Second term (1999–2002)====
In the 1999 parliamentary election the Socialist Party and the opposition won exactly the same number of seats (115). Guterres was reappointed to office and from January to July 2000 occupied the six-month rotating presidency of the European Council. His second term in government was not as successful, however. Internal party conflicts, an economic slowdown, and the Hintze Ribeiro Bridge disaster damaged his authority and popularity. Nevertheless, some long-lasting measures were taken during his second term: in October 2000, the Parliament approved the decriminalization of drug use (effective 1 July 2001) and in March 2001, same-sex civil unions were legalized.

In December 2001, following a disastrous defeat for the Socialist Party in local elections, Guterres resigned to &quot;prevent the country from falling into a political swamp&quot;. President Jorge Sampaio dissolved Parliament and called for elections. Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues, until then minister for social security, assumed the Socialist Party leadership, but the general election was lost to the Social Democratic Party of José Manuel Durão Barroso, who later became president of the European Commission.

===President of Socialist International===

Guterres was elected president of Socialist International in November 1999, overlapping with his second term as prime minister of Portugal until his resignation from the latter post in December 2001. He remained president of the Socialist International until June 2005.

==Diplomatic career==
In 2005, following Guterres&#x27;s proposal, George Papandreou was elected vice president of the Socialist International; in 2006, Papandreou succeeded him as president of the Socialist International.

In May 2005, Guterres was elected High Commissioner for Refugees for a five-year term by the UN General Assembly, replacing Ruud Lubbers.

===High Commissioner for Refugees===
As High Commissioner, Guterres headed one of the world&#x27;s largest humanitarian organizations, which at the end of his term had more than 10,000 staff working in 126 countries providing protection and assistance to over 60 million refugees, returnees, internally displaced people and stateless persons. His time in office was marked by a fundamental organizational reform, cutting staff and administrative costs in the UNHCR&#x27;s Geneva head office and expanding UNHCR&#x27;s emergency response capacity during the worst displacement crisis since the Second World War.

From 19 to 23 March 2006, Guterres visited Beijing, China, and expressed his objection to repatriation of North Korean refugees by the Chinese government.

In a February 2007 NPR interview devoted mainly to the plight of Iraqi refugees, Guterres said that this was one of the greatest refugee crises in the Middle East since 1948. Among poorly publicized refugee crises, he cited those in the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. During his final years as High Commissioner, he worked chiefly to secure international aid for the refugees of the Syrian civil war, calling the refugee crisis an &quot;existential&quot; one for host countries (such as Lebanon and Jordan), and calling additional aid a &quot;matter of survival&quot; for the refugees. He was an outspoken advocate for a more coordinated and humane approach by European countries to the Mediterranean refugee crisis. In June 2013, he launched a US$5 billion aid effort, its biggest ever, to help up to 10.25 million Syrians that year.
In what was widely considered a very effective PR move, Guterres appointed American actress Angelina Jolie as his special envoy to represent UNHCR and himself at the diplomatic level in 2012. Together they visited the Kilis Oncupinar Accommodation Facility in Turkey (2012); the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan (2013); and the Maritime Squadron of the Armed Forces of Malta (2015). They also appeared jointly before the United Nations Security Council (2015).

In early 2015, the General Assembly voted to extend Guterres&#x27;s mandate by 6 months to 31 December, on recommendation of United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. In light of the European migrant crisis, the UNHCR&#x27;s 98-member executive committee (EXCOM) later requested that Ban recommend extending Guterres&#x27;s term by another year, but Ban disregarded the request. Guterres left office on 31 December 2015, having served the second-longest term as High Commissioner in the organization&#x27;s history, after Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan.

In 2015, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa appointed Guterres to serve as a Member of the Council of State of Portugal; he resigned after being appointed as the UN&#x27;s 9th secretary-general.

===United Nations secretary-general===
====Candidacy====

Guterres became United Nations Secretary-General on 1 January 2017, following his formal election by the UN General Assembly on 13 October 2016.
On 29 February 2016, Guterres submitted his nomination as Portugal&#x27;s candidate for the 2016 UN secretary-general selection. This was the first time candidates for secretary-general had to present their platform in public hearings in the UN General Assembly, a process during which Guterres emerged as a much stronger candidate than had been initially expected, given that he fit the bill on neither the gender nor the geographic scores.

On 5 October, the 15-member United Nations Security Council announced that it had agreed to nominate Guterres, after an informal secret ballot in which he gained 13 &quot;encourage&quot; votes and two &quot;no opinion&quot; votes. The Security Council officially nominated Guterres in a formal resolution on 6 October. A week later, he was formally elected by the United Nations General Assembly in its 71st session. Guterres took office on 1 January 2017. Guterres is the first national leader to become the U.N. Secretary-General.

The UN&#x27;s role in the Haiti cholera outbreak was widely discussed and criticized after the Ban Ki-moon administration denied the issue for several months. According to the Boston-based Institute for Justice &amp; Democracy in Haiti as well as numerous conclusive scientific studies, the UN is the proximate cause for bringing cholera to Haiti. Peacekeepers sent to Haiti from Nepal in 2010 were carrying asymptomatic cholera and failed to treat their waste properly before dumping it into one of Haiti&#x27;s main water streams. During his UNSG informal dialogue, Jamaica, on behalf of the Caribbean Community, asked if the UN should assume liability for any deaths within local populations that result from the introduction of infectious disease by its peacekeepers. Jamaica also asked if Guterres believed compensation should be provided. Guterres responded by calling the situation a &quot;particularly complex question&quot;, saying it was difficult to preserve diplomatic immunity while also ensuring there is no impunity, but that he would &quot;pay a lot of attention in trying to find the right equilibrium between these two aspects that are absolutely crucial&quot;. In a UN General Assembly meeting in late October 2016, the representative from Haiti called the UN&#x27;s current and future response to the cholera epidemic &quot;a litmus test of the system&#x27;s commitment to the promotion of human rights&quot;. Though many had hoped Guterres&#x27;s term would mark a break with the inaction that characterized Ban&#x27;s response to the epidemic, Guterres has done little to signal a commitment to Haitian cholera victims. As of April 2017, five months into his term as secretary-general, only $10 million had been contributed to the $400 million fund to fight cholera and provide material assistance to victims the UN announced in 2016.
In 2016, Anders Kompass exposed the sexual assault of children by peacekeepers in the Central African Republic and, as a consequence, was dismissed by Ban&#x27;s administration before being rehabilitated in court. During the United Nations Secretary-General Candidate informal dialogues, Guterres indicated it was completely unacceptable that there be UN forces committing human rights violations such as rape and sexual violence. &quot;All of us together—states and UN—must do our utmost to ensure that any kind of action of this type is severely punished,&quot; he said. The United States raised the question of international tribunals to try peacekeepers for their crimes. Guterres responded by saying an independent jurisdiction would be excellent but that &quot;the only way to get there is through a new compact with all key parties—true contributors, financial contributors—and to make sure that there is an adjustment in the relation between countries, the UN, and the support those that are contributing with troops receive, in order to be able to do it much better.&quot;

====First term====
On 1 January 2017, on his first day as secretary-general of the United Nations, Guterres pledged to make 2017 a year for peace. &quot;Let us resolve to put peace first,&quot; he said. On 12 April 2017, Guterres appointed an eight-member independent panel to assess and enhance the effectiveness of UN-Habitat after the adoption of the New Urban Agenda. The panel&#x27;s recommendation to establish an independent coordinating mechanism, &#x27;UN-Urban&#x27;, met with criticism from urban experts and the African Urban Institute. On 20 June 2017, &quot;Secretary-General António Guterres warned the Trump administration, that if the United States disengages from many issues confronting the international community it will be replaced&quot;.
In response to the death of Chinese Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died of organ failure while in government custody, Guterres said he was deeply saddened. After the violence during the 2017 Catalan independence referendum, Guterres trusted Spanish institutions to find a solution. He gave the same message when Catalonia declared independence on 27 October 2017 but said the solution should be made under the constitutional framework.
Guterres criticized the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and the naval, land and air blockade of Yemen. The blockade has further aggravated Yemen&#x27;s severe humanitarian crisis. Guterres said that the intervention in Yemen &quot;is a stupid war. I think this war is against the interests of Saudi Arabia and the Emirates... [and] of the people of Yemen.&quot; Guterres opposed US President Donald Trump&#x27;s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital. In March 2018, Guterres said the population of Syria&#x27;s Eastern Ghouta was living in &quot;hell on earth&quot;. In one district, 93% of buildings had been damaged or destroyed by December, according to UN satellite imagery analysis. A recent wave of bombings has caused further destruction.

Guterres called the 2018 North Korea–United States summit a &quot;crucial milestone&quot; for nuclear disarmament. He urged both sides to &quot;seize this momentous opportunity&quot; and offered UN assistance to achieve the goal of dismantling North Korea&#x27;s nuclear weapons program. In August 2018, Guterres called for an independent investigation into a Saudi Arabian-led coalition air strike in Yemen that killed 51 civilians, including 40 children.
Guterres condemned the persecution of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar and called for a stronger response to the crisis. In September 2018, during his address to the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, Guterres became the first secretary to say that advancing technology will disrupt labor markets like never before and to advocate stronger safety nets like Universal Basic Income. In 2019, human rights groups criticized Guterres for being &quot;silent&quot; as China sent ethnic Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities to the Xinjiang internment camps. Human Rights Watch chief Kenneth Roth said that Guterres &quot;has been notably silent on one of the most important, ... the most brazen human rights abuses, ... because he is worried about upsetting the Chinese.&quot;

In June 2019, Guterres stated that the &quot;U.N. has the obligation to assume global leadership&quot; in tackling climate change in the context of a visit to the pacific island of Tuvalu. He had previously supported other multilateral environmental initiatives, such as ecocide becoming a crime at the International Criminal Court and the Global Pact for the Environment that was put forward by France in September 2017. In September 2019, Guterres condemned Israeli plans to annex the eastern portion of the occupied West Bank known as the Jordan Valley. Guterres expressed his &quot;deep concern&quot; at the spiralling violence in Syria a day after Turkey launched an offensive in Kurdish-controlled areas. He said any solution to the conflict needed to respect the sovereignty of the territory and the unity of Syria.

In 2020, the World Jewish Congress awarded him the &quot;Theodor Herzl Prize&quot;. In the laudatory speech, its president Ronald Lauder called Guterres a &quot;true and devoted friend of the Jewish people and the state of Israel.&quot; More than that: &quot;the voice of fairness and justice that the State of Israel and the Jewish people had hoped for at the United Nations for a very, very long time.&quot;

Guterres praised the Israel–United Arab Emirates peace agreement, stating that he welcomes &quot;any initiative that can promote peace and security in the Middle East region.&quot; Guterres expressed the hope that the agreement between Israel and Sudan to normalize relations would create opportunities for peace and prosperity. On 10 August 2020, responding to an explosion in Beirut, Guterres expressed his support for all people in need in Lebanon, especially women and girls who are most vulnerable in times of crisis. On 22 September, he appealed for global solidarity to overcome COVID-19, and again called for a global ceasefire by the end of 2020. In September 2020, Guterres stated that he would continue with &quot;a serious dialogue&quot; with UN member states, for a comprehensive Reform of the UN Security Council.

On 6 October 2020, Guterres expressed deep concern over the escalation of hostilities in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh and called on Armenia and Azerbaijan to immediately halt fighting and progress towards a peaceful resolution.

====Second term====
On 8 June 2021, the United Nations Security Council expressed support for his re-election as secretary-general. On 18 June 2021, Guterres was appointed for a second term by a voting session of the United Nations General Assembly.

In July 2021 Guterres stated it was &quot;highly desirable&quot; to make ecocide a crime at the International Criminal Court.

In April 2022, Guterres went to Ukraine during the Russian invasion. He was surprised to see that the Russian army shelled parts of Kyiv even when he was there. In response to evacuation efforts initiated by the UN on 30 April following Guterres&#x27;s visit to Ukraine and Russia, dozens of civilians were photographed by Reuters as being allowed by Russian troops to be evacuated from their entrenched positions in the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works in Mariupol. Guterres stated that &quot;instead of hitting the brakes on the decarbonization of the global economy, now is the time to put the pedal to the metal towards a renewable energy future.&quot;

In May 2022, Guterres went on a tour through West Africa. There, he met families who had been affected by the Islamist insurgency, and pushed for robust African peace initiatives and other counter-terrorism operations under the wing of the African Union.

On 22 July 2022, together with Turkey, the United Nations under the leadership of Guterres brokered a deal between Russia and Ukraine clearing the way for the export of grain from Ukrainian ports.
In November 2022, Guterres met with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. He praised the ceasefire between the Ethiopian government and Tigray rebels that ended the two-year Tigray War, saying the war in Ethiopia had resulted in &quot;more casualties&quot; than the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In January 2023, Guterres called for a global effort to transform education and added that it was time to &quot;translate their Summit Commitments into concreate actions&quot;, create an inclusive learning environment that supports all students and &quot;to end all the discriminatory laws and practices that hinder access to education&quot;.

In April 2023, the 2023 Pentagon document leaks revealed that Guterres was spied on by U.S. intelligence. Previously, the U.S. and other Western nations had accused Guterres to be overly soft on Russian president Vladimir Putin.

In May 2023, Guterres stated that peace negotiations to end the Russo-Ukrainian War were &quot;not possible at this moment&quot;, saying it was clear that Russia and Ukraine &quot;are completely absorbed in this war&quot; and &quot;are convinced that they can win.&quot;

In July 2023, Guterres proposed the creation of an international body to oversee artificial intelligence. He stated that &quot;Generative AI has enormous potential for good and evil at scale. Its creators themselves have warned that much bigger, potentially catastrophic and existential risks lie ahead&quot;. He also said that the United Nations has an opportunity to adopt rules that make consensus and to foster international coordination.

Guterres condemned the actions of Hamas during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, but said he was &quot;deeply distressed&quot; by Israel&#x27;s decision to impose a total blockade on the Gaza Strip. As the Nation mentioned, Guterres condemned Israel for the &quot;clear violations of international humanitarian law&quot; and demanded an immediate ceasefire. After Guterres made statements critical of Israel&#x27;s actions in Gaza, particularly his claim that Hamas&#x27; attack &quot;did not happen in a vacuum&quot;, and &quot;the Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation,&quot; Israeli ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan demanded Guterres&#x27;s resignation, calling his statements &quot;pure blood libel&quot;. In the aftermath of Guterres&#x27;s statement, Israel blocked issuing visas to UN representatives. Following this, Guterres said that he was &quot;shocked by the misrepresentations&quot; of his statement, pointing out he had also said that &quot;...the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas.&quot;

In February 2024, Guterres called for a full investigation into the death of Russian opposition activist and political prisoner Alexei Navalny.

In August 2024, Guterres was awarded, unanimously, East-Timorese citizenship by the National Parliament of East-Timor for his dedication to the country&#x27;s independence. On his citizenship acceptance speech Guterres alluded to the fact that &quot;from now on there is a UN Secretary-General who is both Portuguese and East-Timorese&quot;. This is first time a UN Secretary-General holds double-citizenship.

In October 2024, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz declared Guterres &quot;persona non grata&quot; in Israel for his declarations about the October 2024 Iranian strikes against Israel in which he called for a ceasefire but did not mention the Iranian attack on Israel. Later he condemned the Iranian strikes on Israel.

Following Guterres warmly shaking Vladimir Putin&#x27;s hand during the 16th BRICS summit on 24 October 2024 in Kazan, Volodymyr Zelenskyy refused to meet with Guterres in Kyiv with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine releasing the statement: &quot;This is a wrong choice that does not advance the cause of peace. It only damages the UN&#x27;s reputation.&quot; and adding &quot;The UN secretary general declined Ukraine&#x27;s invitation to the first Global Peace Summit in Switzerland. He did, however, accept the invitation to Kazan from war criminal Putin.&quot; Putin has been a fugitive since 17 March 2023 when the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrant following an investigation of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide by Putin during the Russo-Ukrainian War.

In December 2024, Gutteres stated that he also wants to see a permanent seat for the African Union on the UN Security Council, for more fairness and justice in this world towards African countries.

On 25 January 2025, Guterres called for Rwanda to remove its troops from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and end its support for the M23 rebels.

* Gay Star/update/upstart/Northern Gay were a family of publications covering a range of topics and uses. For example, Gay Star was mainly quarterly and normally ran as an A3 fold over with 24 to 28 pages, providing in depth articles, movie/book/theatre/music reviews, even sometimes poetry. It had some advertising of local events and venues, and also provided advice on medical issues such as AIDs and the Health Clinic location. The other magazines were in a number of formats, A4, A3 fold over and these were often used to get news quickly out to the community and warn them of some kind of possible issue in the gay community e.g. police sting operations, people being beaten up, a predator hunting gay people. A full set of these magazines is located in the Linenhall Library, 17 Donegall Square North Belfast, BT1 5GB, and listings of LGBTQ+ material can be searched on their website https://www.linenhall.com/. It should also be noted that these magazines started off as part of the Northern Ireland Gay Rights Association, but in later years were independent of the organisation, but still supporting the aims and objectives of NIGRA. The two main editors over time were Sean McGouran and Terry McFarlane. Sean is now retired and Terry runs his own website ACOMSDave as a community journalist https://acomsdave.com/

<text>Caiman is a genus of caimans within the alligatorid subfamily Caimaninae. They inhabit Central and South America. They are relatively small sized crocodilians, with all species reaching lengths of only a couple of meters and weighing on average.

==Classification==
The genus &quot;Caiman&quot; contains three extant (living) species: the Broad-snouted caiman (&quot;Caiman latirostris&quot;), the Spectacled caiman (&quot;Caiman crocodilus&quot;), and the Yacare caiman (&quot;Caiman yacare&quot;). There are also several extinct fossil species in the genus - possibly up to eight species. The genus &quot;Caiman&quot; belongs to the caiman subfamily Caimaninae, and the relationships of the living species of caimans can be shown in the cladogram below, based on molecular DNA-based phylogenetic studies:
The below detailed cladogram of Caimaninae includes extinct fossil species, based on morphological analysis:
==Characteristics==
Caimans are similar to alligators in morphology but differ in having bony plates, known as osteoderms, buried in the skin on the underside. The broad-snouted and spectacled caimans are characterised by having a bony ridge across the bridge of the nose just below the eyes. The yacare caiman is the largest species in the genus, attaining an average adult length of , the spectacled caiman reaches , with the female rather smaller, and the broad-snouted caiman is the smallest, more typically measuring for males and for females.

==Distribution and habitat==
This genus is present in Central and South America. The spectacled caiman (&quot;Caiman crocodilus&quot;) occurs in Central America and parts of the northern half of South America at altitudes of up to about . It is usually found in freshwater, but also visits the brackish water of estuaries on occasion. It has varying habitats including wetlands and slow-moving rivers and streams. The yacare caiman (&quot;Caiman yacare&quot;) occurs in the central part of southern South America, particularly in the Pantanal region, the largest tropical wetland area in the world, which is flooded seasonally by the Paraguay River. The broad-snouted caiman (&quot;Caiman latirostris&quot;) occurs in central and eastern South America, its range including southeastern Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and northern Argentina, within the drainage systems of the Paraná, Paraguay, Uruguay and São Francisco Rivers.

==Behaviour==
Caimans spend much of their time basking on mudflats or in sunlit, muddy jungle streams. In the dry season, large numbers may accumulate in pools as the surrounding land dries up. They can move on land with some rapidity, hiss when disturbed, and young individuals can inflate themselves before opening their jaws aggressively. Caimans do not usually attack humans but domestic livestock are at risk. They seize their prey and drag it underwater to drown it. They may observe a potential prey, swim away, submerge and return to attack the floating bird or drinking mammal from underwater. Juvenile caimans feed on crustaceans and molluscs while larger animals feed on amphibians, fish, birds, mammals and reptiles.

A caiman nest is a mound of vegetation and mud consolidated by the female by lying on it. She then digs a hole in it and buries a few dozen eggs in it. When these hatch, the juveniles use their egg teeth to break their way out. They are about long at hatching, growing to by a year later. They look like miniature versions of their parents but have relatively shorter snouts and larger eyes.

==Taxonomy==
===Extant species===




=== Fossil species ===
Species known only from fossil remains:
* †&quot;Caiman australis&quot; - Ituzaingó Formation, Argentina
* †&quot;Caiman brevirostris&quot; - Solimões Formation, Brazil and Urumaco Formation, Venezuela
* †&quot;Caiman praecursor&quot; - Ituzaingó Formation, Argentina
* †&quot;Caiman wannlangstoni&quot; - Honda Group, Colombia, Pebas Formation, Peru and Urumaco Formation, Venezuela

&quot;Caiman venezuelensis&quot; from the Pleistocene epoch is probably a junior synonym of the spectacled caiman. Some fossil taxa previously included within the genus &quot;Caiman&quot; now belong to separate extinct genera, including &quot;Acresuchus&quot; and &quot;Paranasuchus&quot;.

<doc id="471813" wikidata="Q3983144" url="?curid=471813" title="Perfect storm">
<text>A perfect storm is a meteorological event aggravated by a rare combination of circumstances. The term is used by analogy to an unusually severe storm that results from a rare combination of meteorological phenomena.

Before the early 1990s, the phrases &quot;storm of the century&quot; or &quot;perfect storm&quot; were generally used to describe unusually large or destructive storms. The term superstorm was employed in 1993 by the US National Weather Service to describe a Nor&#x27;easter in March of that year. The term is most frequently used to describe a weather pattern that is as destructive as a hurricane, but which exhibits the cold-weather patterns of a winter storm.

==Origin==
The Oxford English Dictionary has published references going back to 1718 for &quot;perfect storm&quot;, though the earliest citations use the phrase in the sense of &quot;absolute&quot; or &quot;complete&quot;, or for emphasis, as in &quot;a perfect stranger&quot;.

The phrase appears in William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s novel &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; (1847-1848)
The first known use of the expression in the meteorological sense is on May 30, 1850, when the Rev. Lloyd of Withington describes ″A perfect storm of thunder and lightning all over England (except London) doing fearful and fatal damage″ when recording monthly rainfall measurements for that year. This record is kept by the UK Meteorological Office. The next recorded instance is in the March 20, 1936, issue of the &quot;Port Arthur News&quot; in Texas: &quot;The weather bureau describes the disturbance as &#x27;the perfect storm&#x27; of its type. Seven factors were involved in the chain of circumstances that led to the flood.&quot;

In 1993, journalist and author Sebastian Junger planned to write a book about a fishing boat caught in the 1991 Halloween Nor&#x27;easter storm. Technically, this storm was an extratropical cyclone. In the course of his research, he spoke with Bob Case, who had been a deputy meteorologist in the Boston office of the National Weather Service at the time of the storm. Case described to Junger the confluence of three different weather-related phenomena that combined to create what Case referred to as the &quot;perfect situation&quot; to generate such a storm:
* warm air from a low-pressure system coming from one direction
* a flow of cool and dry air generated by a high-pressure from another direction
* tropical moisture provided by tropical storm (or hurricane)

From that, Junger keyed on Case&#x27;s use of the word &quot;perfect&quot; and coined the phrase &quot;perfect storm&quot;, choosing to use &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; as the title of his book.

Junger published his book &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; in 1997 and its success brought the phrase into popular culture. Its adoption was accelerated with the release of the 2000 feature film adaptation of Junger&#x27;s book.
Since the release of the movie, the phrase has grown to mean any event where a situation is aggravated drastically by an exceptionally rare combination of circumstances. 
Although the 1991 Halloween Nor&#x27;easter was a powerful storm by any measure, there have been other storms that have exceeded its strength. 
According to Case, the type of convergence of weather events to which he was referring, while unusual, is not exceptionally rare or unique, despite the way the phrase is commonly used.

==Other uses==
From the beginning, the phrase was in heavy use during the financial crisis of 2007–2008, even to the point of pundits anticipating &quot;another perfect storm&quot;.

The phrase was awarded the top prize by Lake Superior State University in their 2007 list of words that deserve to be banned for overuse.

<doc id="471819" wikidata="Q211751" url="?curid=471819" title="Ichthys">
<text>The ichthys or ichthus (), from the Greek (, 1st cent. AD Koine Greek pronunciation: , &quot;fish&quot;) is (in its modern rendition) a symbol consisting of two intersecting arcs, the ends of the right side extending beyond the meeting point so as to resemble the profile of a fish. It has been speculated that the symbol was adopted by early Christians as a secret symbol; a shibboleth to determine if another was indeed Christian. It is now known colloquially as the &quot;Jesus fish&quot;.

==Origin==

The first appearances of the ichthys in Christian art and literature dates to the 2nd century. The symbol&#x27;s use among Christians had become popular by the late 2nd century, and its use spread widely in the 3rd and 4th centuries.
In early Christian history, the ichthys symbol held &quot;the most sacred significance.&quot; It has been claimed that Christians used it to recognize churches and other believers during a time when they faced persecution in the Roman Empire. The ichthys symbol is also a reference to &quot;the Holy Eucharist, with which the miracle of the multiplication of the loaves and fishes had such intimate connection both in point of time and significance.&quot; Depicted in the Catacombs of Saint Sebastian and of the Catacomb of Priscilla, the symbol is also mentioned in the Latin text titled &quot;Oracula Sibillina&quot; which dates back to the 1st-2nd century.

==Symbolic meaning==

 (), or also with a lunate sigma, is an acronym or acrostic for &quot;Ἰησοῦς Χρῑστός Θεοῦ Υἱός Σωτήρ&quot;, ; contemporary Koine, which translates into English as &#x27;Jesus Christ, God&#x27;s Son, Savior&#x27;.

* Iota (i), &quot;Iēsoûs&quot; (), &quot;Jesus&quot;
* Chi (ch), &quot;Khrīstós&quot; (), &quot;anointed&quot;
* Theta (th), (), &quot;of God&quot;, the genitive singular of , &quot;Theós&quot;, &quot;God&quot;
* Ypsilon (y or u), (), &quot;Son&quot;
* Sigma (s), (), &quot;Savior&quot;

Augustine quotes an ancient text from the Sibylline oracles whose verses are an acrostic of the generating sentence.

A fourth century adaptation of &quot;ichthys&quot; superimposes the Greek letters on top of each other to render a shape akin to an eight-spoked wheel. Though this shape has often been interpreted as such, it has also been proposed that the round symbol represents a loaf of bread.

==In the Gospels==

Fish are mentioned and given symbolic meaning several times in the Gospels. Several of Jesus&#x27; 12 Apostles were fishermen. He commissions them with the words &quot;I will make you fishers of men&quot;. (Mark 1: 16–18)

Having been resurrected, Jesus was given grilled fish in Luke 24:41–43.

At the feeding of the five thousand, a boy is brought to Jesus with &quot;five small loaves and two fish&quot;. The question is asked, &quot;But what are they, among so many?&quot; Jesus multiplies the loaves and fish to feed the multitude. 

In Matthew 13:47–50, the Parable of Drawing in the Net, Jesus compares the angels separating the righteous from the wicked at the end of this world to fishers sorting out their catch, keeping the good fish and throwing the bad fish away. 

In John 21:11, it is related that the disciples fished all night but caught nothing. Jesus instructed them to cast the nets on the other side of the boat, and they drew in 153 fish. When they return to shore with their catch, Jesus is waiting for them and has cooked some fish for them to eat. 

In Matthew 17:24–27, upon being asked if his Teacher pays the temple (or two-drachma) tax, Simon Peter answers yes. Christ tells Peter to go to the water and cast a line, saying that a coin sufficient for both of them will be found in the fish&#x27;s mouth. Peter does this and finds the coin.

The fish is also used by Jesus to describe &quot;the Sign of Jonah&quot;. (Matthew 12:38–45) This is symbolic of Jesus&#x27;s resurrection, upon which the entire Christian faith is based. (1 Corinthians 15:1–58)

==Early church==

According to tradition, ancient Christians, during their persecution by the Roman Empire in the first few centuries after Christ, used the fish symbol to mark meeting places and tombs, or to distinguish friends from foes:

There are several other hypotheses as to why the fish was chosen. Some sources indicate that the earliest literary references came from the recommendation of Clement of Alexandria to his readers (Paedagogus, III, xi) to engrave their seals with the dove or fish. However, it can be inferred from Roman monumental sources such as the Cappella Greca and the Sacrament Chapels of the catacomb of St. Callistus that the fish symbol was known to Christians much earlier.

==In popular culture==
In the 1970s the &quot;Jesus Fish&quot; started to be used as an icon of modern Christianity. In 1973 the symbol and message was taken to the Aquarius Rock Festival in Nimbin, Australia. Today, it can be seen as a decal or emblem on the rear of automobiles or as pendants or necklaces as a sign that the owner is a Christian. Versions of this include an Ichthys with &quot;Jesus&quot; or &quot;ΙΧΘΥΣ&quot; in the centre, or simply the Ichthys outline by itself. According to one writer, while many Christians hang a cross necklace or rosary inside their vehicles, &quot;the fish sticker on the car is a more conscious symbol of a witnessing Christian—significantly, unlike the former, it is on the outside of the car for everyone to see.&quot;

The Ichthus Music Festival is an annual large outdoor Christian music festival held in mid-June in Wilmore, Kentucky. It is the oldest Christian music festival in the United States, starting in 1970.

==As a secret symbol==
The idea that the Ichthys was used as a secret symbol is based on an argument from silence brought forward by Robert Mowat. Both the Licinia Amia Epitaph and the Abercius inscription show the Ichthys without mention of Jesus Christ, while featuring clear attestations to Christian beliefs and themes. From this Mowat speculates, they were purposely avoiding outing themselves as Christians. As none of the early Christian sources link the Ichthys to Christian persecution, this connection has now mostly fallen out of favor (Rasimus compiles a list of early Christian references to the Ichthys, none of which point towards the persecution hypothesis and instead link it to baptism, the Eucharist, and the story of the feeding of the multitude). The idea is prominently featured and likely popularized by the 1951 movie &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;.

<doc id="471822" wikidata="Q3381867" url="?curid=471822" title="G-men (magazine)">
<text>is a Japanese gay lifestyle brand, and formerly a monthly magazine.

==History==
Gay magazines in Japan, along with much gay culture, are segregated by &#x27;type&#x27; (e.g., muscular men, older men, specific occupations); &quot;G-men&quot; was founded in 1995 to cater to gay men who preferred &quot;macho fantasy&quot;, as opposed to the sleeker, yaoi-inspired styles popular in the 1980s, and focused on &quot;macho type&quot; (muscular, bearish men) and &quot;gaten-kei&quot; (ガテン系, blue-collar workers).

&quot;G-men&quot; included both editorial and photographic material, as well as prose stories and manga. &quot;G-men&quot; was designed to encourage steady readership by presenting a more well-defined fantasy image, and by running serialized, continuing manga stories (as opposed to the one-shot stories standard in other in gay men&#x27;s magazines) which encouraged purchase of every issue. Gengoroh Tagame&#x27;s work was an important influence on &quot;G-men&quot;″s style; he provided the cover for the first 63 issues, as well as manga stories for most issues. &quot;G-men&quot; was also one of the first gay men&#x27;s publishers to offer collections of manga bound into &quot;tankōbon&quot;. The manga published in &quot;G-men&quot;, particularly Tagame&#x27;s work, was influential in the development of manga for gay men as a marketable category.

Issues of &quot;G-men&quot; usually had approximately 300–500 pages, including several pages of glossy colour and some black and white photographs and drawings of hairy, sometimes bearded, muscular men in their 20s and 30s (these photographs are censored in accordance with Japan&#x27;s rules; while they feature explicit depictions of sex, genitals—and most pubic hair—are obscured). The photographs sometimes featured traditional themes, such as &quot;fundoshi&quot;, traditional Japanese loincloths. Despite the inclusion of pornographic pictures and stories, however, &quot;G-men&quot; is not considered a pornographic magazine.

&quot;G-men&quot; had fewer general articles than other magazines such as &quot;Barazoku&quot; and more short fiction and serialized stories. Issues included community listings, several different stories—often pornographic—and several in comic form as well, classified ads, and advertisements from gay-related and gay-friendly businesses such as spas, clubs and hotels, bars, cafes and restaurants, host bars (hustler bars), and brothels.

In February 2016, publisher Furukawa Shobu announced that it would cease publication of &quot;G-men&quot; as a print magazine, though it continues to produce DVDs, books, and gay manga under the &quot;G-men&quot; brand.

<text>The Best of The Waterboys 81–90 is a compilation album by The Waterboys, released on 29 April 1991.

==Background==
&quot;The Best of The Waterboys 81–90&quot; is made up of 12 tracks which were personally selected by the band&#x27;s lead singer, musician and songwriter Mike Scott. The album, along with a re-issue of the single &quot;The Whole of the Moon&quot;, was an attempt by Chrysalis Records to boost the band&#x27;s record sales to match their reputation. A survey of album buyers carried out by the label found that 11% considered themselves fans of the Waterboys and only 1% actually owned any of their singles or albums. The re-release of &quot;The Whole of the Moon&quot; preceded the album and reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart. From 22 April, a week before the compilation&#x27;s release, Chrysalis launched a £100,000 marketing campaign which included press advertising and in-store displays, and this was followed by a £150,000 TV advertising campaign.

Jason Guy, the head of marketing at Chrysalis, told &quot;Music Week&quot; in 1991, &quot;The band have a great reputation and they&#x27;ve released five albums, but people don&#x27;t know where to start. This compilation solves that problem.&quot; The compilation&#x27;s booklet was provided with images of the band&#x27;s studio albums along with their track listings to encourage buyers to seek out the band&#x27;s back catalogue based on the tracks they liked on the compilation. The album was released on 29 April and reached No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart. It was also a success in Europe, reaching No. 11 on the European Top 100 Albums chart.

Speaking of the compilation to &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in 1991, Scott stated, 

==Critical reception==
Upon its release, Ian Gittins of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; described the compilation as &quot;unreservedly recommended&quot; and a &quot;splendid document, a treasure trove which tacitly acknowledges that Mike Scott&#x27;s aesthetic fortunes have taken a recent dip&quot;. He favoured the material from the Waterboys&#x27; earlier &quot;Big Music&quot; period, commenting, &quot;Few bands have soared like the Waterboys. So very few have found it in them to make music gripped by such a huge, hurting sense of ambition, so devout a quest for the stars, so passionate a bid to transcend history and genre via mighty spirit. Few have seen so much of the moon. And few star-seekers, it must sadly be said, have plunged back to the mud of terra firma with such a sickening thud. The Waterboys had it all.&quot;

<text>Badi, stylized as Bʌ́di (), was a monthly Japanese magazine for gay men. Established in November 1994 by Terra Publications, the first edition was released in January 1995. The title comes from the Japanese pronunciation of &quot;buddy&quot;.

==Overview==
The primary demographic of &quot;Badi&quot; was younger men (and admirers of younger men). The magazine featured articles on fashion, health, and relationships; community news and event listings; and stories and images in both photographic and gay manga formats. Issues of &quot;Badi&quot; were approximately 500–1000 pages, including several pages of glossy colour. Though the magazine included pornographic pictures and stories, &quot;Badi&quot; was not mainly a pornographic magazine.

==Advertisement==
There was also a personal ad section, as well as advertisements from gay-related and gay-friendly businesses such as spas, clubs and hotels, bars, cafes and restaurants, host bars (hustler bars), brothels, and retail shops. 

&quot;Badi&quot; announced in December 2018 that it would be folding, with the final issue to be published in March 2019.

<doc id="471830" wikidata="Q3111368" url="?curid=471830" title="Vesica piscis">
<text>The vesica piscis is a type of lens, a mathematical shape formed by the intersection of two disks with the same radius, intersecting in such a way that the center of each disk lies on the perimeter of the other. In Latin, &quot;&quot; literally means &quot;bladder of a fish&quot;, reflecting the shape&#x27;s resemblance to the conjoined dual air bladders (swim bladder) found in most fish. In Italian, the shape&#x27;s name is &quot;&quot; (&quot;almond&quot;). A similar shape in three dimensions is the lemon.
This figure appears in the first proposition of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, where it forms the first step in constructing an equilateral triangle using a compass and straightedge. The triangle has as its vertices the two disk centers and one of the two sharp corners of the vesica piscis.

== Mathematical description ==
Mathematically, the vesica piscis is a special case of a lens, the shape formed by the intersection of two disks.

The mathematical ratio of the height of the vesica piscis to the width across its center is the square root of 3, or 1.7320508... (since if straight lines are drawn connecting the centers of the two circles with each other and with the two points where the circles intersect, two equilateral triangles join along an edge). The ratios 265:153 = 1.7320261... and 1351:780 = 1.7320513... are two of a series of approximations to this value, each with the property that no better approximation can be obtained with smaller whole numbers. Archimedes of Syracuse, in his &quot;Measurement of a Circle&quot;, uses these ratios as upper and lower bounds:

: formula_1

===Area===
The area of the vesica piscis is formed by two equilateral triangles and four equal circular segments. In the drawing, one triangle and one segment appear in blue.

One triangle and one segment form a sector of one sixth of the circle (60°).
The area of the sector is then: formula_2.

Since the side of the equilateral triangle has length , its area is formula_3.

The area of the segment is the difference between those two areas:

: formula_4

By summing the areas of two triangles and four segments, we obtain the area of the vesica piscis:

: formula_5

==Applications==

The two circles of the vesica piscis, or three circles forming in pairs three vesicae, are commonly used in Venn diagrams. Arcs of the same three circles can also be used to form the triquetra symbol, and the Reuleaux triangle.

In Christian art, some aureolas are in the shape of a vertically oriented vesica piscis, and the seals of ecclesiastical organizations can be enclosed within a vertically oriented vesica piscis (instead of the more usual circular enclosure). Also, the ichthys symbol incorporates the vesica piscis shape. Ecclesiastical heraldry of the Catholic Church appeared first in seals, nearly all vesica-shaped. The vesica piscis has been used within Freemasonry, most notably in the shapes of the collars worn by officiants of the Masonic rituals. It was also considered the proper shape for the enclosure of the seals of Masonic lodges.

The vesica piscis is also used as a proportioning system in architecture, in particular Gothic architecture. The system was illustrated in Cesare Cesariano&#x27;s 1521 version of Vitruvius&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, which he called &quot;the rule of the German architects&quot;. The vesica piscis was a leitmotif of architect Carlo Scarpa and is used as a &quot;viewing device&quot; in Tomba Brion (Brion Cemetery) in San Vito d&#x27;Altivole, Italy.

Several other artworks or designs have also featured this shape:
*The cover of the Chalice Well in Glastonbury (United Kingdom) depicts a stylized version of the vesica piscis design.
*Several mathematical sculptures by Susan Latham use a three-dimensional form obtained from the planar depiction of two circles forming the vesica piscis, deformed into as a curved surface with folds along the inner arcs of the vesica and with the two outer arcs meeting in a single curve. Its shape can be analyzed using the mathematics of developable surfaces.

==Symbolism==
Various symbolic meanings have been associated with the vesica piscis:
*When arranged so that the lens is horizontal, with its two overlaid circles placed one above the other, it symbolizes the interface between the spiritual and physical worlds, represented by the two circles. In this arrangement, it also resembles the ichthys (fish) symbol for Christ, and has also been said to be a symbol of life, of &quot;the materialization of the spirit&quot;, of Christ&#x27;s mediation between heaven and earth, and of the eucharist.
*When arranged so that the lens is placed vertically, and used to depict a halo or aureola, it represents divine glory.
*When arranged so that the lens is placed vertically, it has also been said to be a depiction of the vulva, and therefore symbolic of femininity and fertility.
*A diagram of Euclid&#x27;s use of this diagram to construct an equilateral triangle, appearing with the vertical placement of the lens in James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, has been said to be &quot;emblematic of rational man&quot;, but overlaid onto a vaginal triangle again symbolizing femininity.

<doc id="471833" wikidata="Q76292543" url="?curid=471833" title="President of Fiji">
<text>The president of Fiji is the head of state of the Republic of Fiji. The president is appointed by the Parliament for a three-year term under the terms of the 2013 Constitution. Although not entirely a figurehead, the role of president in the government is largely ceremonial, but there are important reserve powers that may be exercised in the event of a crisis. In addition, the president is the commander-in-chief of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces.

==History of the office==
The office of the president was established following two military coups in 1987 that led to the proclamation of a republic on 7 October, ending the Fijian monarchy. Major-General Sitiveni Rabuka, who had masterminded the coups, formed an interim military government with himself as its head. He did not, however, take the title of president, and on 5 December appointed Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, the last governor-general, as the first president of the republic.

A civilian putsch instigated by George Speight led to another constitutional upheaval in 2000. President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara resigned on 29 May rather than abrogate the Constitution, as the military, supported by the Supreme Court, had asked. (Whether or not his resignation was forced was the subject of a police investigation that continued up to the time of the 2006 coup). Commodore Frank Bainimarama took power as the head of the interim military government (as had Rabuka in 1987), until &quot;Ratu&quot; Josefa Iloilo was appointed President on 13 July.

On 5 December 2006, the military forces again overthrew the government. Bainimarama declared himself acting president; he initially said that he had assumed the office in an interim capacity, and would soon ask the Great Council of Chiefs to reinstate Iloilo, but on 17 December he insisted that he was now the president and that the Great Council should recognise him as such. Iloilo was re-instated as President on 4 January 2007.

In January 2008, Bainimarama stated that the military was &quot;the executive authority in the appointment of the President&quot;, following the suspension of the Great Council of Chiefs. The president would be a military appointee, until a reformed GCC were installed.

A few days later, Citizens Constitutional Forum director Reverend Akuila Yabaki suggested that the position of President should, in future, be open to persons of any ethnicity, rather than reserved for indigenous Fijians. This suggestion was controversial, and was notably opposed by deposed prime minister Laisenia Qarase. A Rewa chief, Ro Filipe Tuisawau, also opposed the idea, and stated his view on the function of the presidency:

On 28 July 2009, Iloilo announced that he would be leaving office on 30 July. Brigadier-General (Rtd) Ratu Epeli Nailatikau succeeded him as acting president. On 5 November 2009, Nailatikau was sworn in as president.

In March 2012, the Bainimarama government disestablished the Great Council of Chiefs by decree. Bainimarama confirmed this meant there would need to be a new method to appoint the president; this, he said, would be provided by a new Constitution, to be adopted in 2013 following consultations with the people.

On 12 October 2015, the Parliament elected Major-General (Rtd) Jioji Konrote as president. On 12 November 2015, Konrote was sworn in as president. On 31 August 2018, Konrote was re-elected as president.

On 22 October 2021, the Parliament elected Ratu Wiliame Katonivere as president. On 12 November 2021, Katonivere was sworn in as president.

<text>&quot;Club Fed&quot; is a derisive term used in North America to refer to a prison whose accommodations are seen as less severe than many other prisons. &quot;Club Fed&quot; is a pun on the &quot;Club Med&quot; chain of all-inclusive resorts. The 1999 movie &quot;Office Space&quot; made a reference to this style of prison by referring to it as a &quot;white-collar, minimum-security resort.&quot; However, later in the film, a lawyer rebuts this view by stating that residents of federal prisons are subject to physical and sexual violence.

In Canada, the Joliette Institution for Women was nicknamed &quot;Club Fed&quot; because of the prison&#x27;s supposedly luxurious conditions and lax restrictions, claims the prison has denied. Also in Canada, the William Head Institution in British Columbia is known as &quot;Club Fed&quot; due to its pastoral country setting which includes tennis courts, a baseball diamond, and a small golf course.

<text>Éntella (Greek: ), was an ancient city in the interior of Sicily, situated on the left bank of the river Hypsas (modern Belice), and nearly midway between the two seas, being about 40 km from the mouth of the Hypsas, and much about the same distance from the north coast of the island, at the Gulf of Castellamare.

==History==

It was apparently of Sicanian origin, though the traditions concerning its foundation connected it with the Elymi and the supposed Trojan colony. According to some writers it was founded by Acestes, and named after his wife Entella, a tradition to which Silius Italicus alludes, while others ascribed its foundation to Elymus, and Virgil represents Entellus (evidently the eponymous hero of the city) as a friend and comrade of Acestes. It was, together with Erice and Segesta, among the most important centres of the Elymians. Thucydides, however, says Eryx and Egesta were the only two cities of the Elymi, and does not notice Entella at all, any more than the other places of native Sicanian or Siculian origin.

The first historical mention of Entella is found in Diodorus, who tells us that in 404 BC the 1200 Campanian mercenaries, who had been in the service of the Carthaginians during the war, having been admitted into the city on friendly terms, turned their arms against the inhabitants, put all the male citizens to the sword, and made themselves masters of the place, of which they retained possession for many years. During the subsequent wars of Dionysius with the Carthaginians, the Campanian occupants of Entella sided with their former masters, and even continued faithful to their alliance in 396 BC, when all the cities of Sicily except five went over to that of Dionysius.

It was not until 368 BC that the Syracusan despot was able to reduce Entella; the city appears to have still remained in the hands of the Campanians, but was now hostile to the Carthaginians, who (in 345 BC) in consequence ravaged its territory, and blockaded the city itself. Soon after we find the latter apparently in their hands, but it was recovered by Timoleon, who restored it to liberty and independence.

From this time we hear little more of it. The name is only incidentally mentioned during the First Punic War, and was abandoned and took no part in the struggles between Rome and Carthage. It was repopulated after the war with refugees and prisoners of war, as indicated by the Entella Decrees, who were Campanians and descendants of the mercenaries who settled in the city in the fifth century BC, and was a tolerably flourishing &quot;municipium&quot;: its territory was fertile in wine as well as corn, and Cicero praises the inhabitants for their industry in its cultivation. It later, like most of the cities of Sicily, suffered severely from the exactions of Verres.

We still find its name both in Pliny (among the &quot;populi stipendiarii&quot;) and Ptolemy but no further notice of it is found in ancient authors. 

It however continued to subsist throughout the Middle Ages, until the 13th century, when, having been converted into a stronghold by the Saracens, it was taken by the emperor Frederick II and utterly destroyed, the inhabitants being removed to Nocera near Naples.

==The Site==

The site, which still retained its ancient name in the days of Fazello, is described by him as a position of great natural strength, surrounded by abrupt precipices on all sides but one, but having a table land of considerable extent on its summit. Its location at Rocca d&#x27;Entella, in the &quot;comune&quot; of Contessa Entellina, stands at an angle of the Belice, so that that river encircles it on the north and west. 

Excavations show that the cult of Demeter and Kore is attested from the 5th to the 3rd century BC in the sanctuary outside the walls. Most of the tombs in the necropolis &quot;A&quot; date back to the Hellenistic age, as shown by the type of burial and the pottery and the famous inscriptions on bronze tablets with the decrees of the cities of Entella and Nakone, in the Salinas Archaeological Museum in Palermo.

===The walls===

An approximately 2800 m long wall protected the north side, most easily accessible from the valley and from the branch of the Belice river (ancient Crimisio); on the south, east and west sides, on the other hand, the rocky walls offer a natural defense. At the junction of the two valleys are gates to the hill of Rocca. The North West gate was accessed by a road, still intact, which winds along the slopes of Cozzo Petraro.

===The agora===

In the eastern valley are imposing remains of public buildings: a temple without peristasis (&quot;oikos&quot;) with an internal altar from the first decades of the 5th century BC, and a granary built at the end of the 4th century and destroyed by a fire in the middle of the 3rd century BC. These two buildings were aligned along the eastern side of the agora.

==Finds==
Around 1970 in the area around the town of Contessa Entellina, eight bronze tablets known as the Entella Decrees were found in which reference is made to the Campanians who made up the population of Entella in the mid-third century BC and who were the descendants of 1200 mercenaries who settled in the city in the fifth century BC. The characters used on the tablets are Greek, but the language spoken by Elimi was Annellenic. Seven of them contained decrees of the city of Entella. The date of the tablets is not certain; but they seem to belong either to the late 4th century or the middle of the 3rd century BC.

There are extant coins of Entella, with the legend at full; while others struck under the Campanian occupation of the city have , and on the reverse .

<text>Contessa Entellina () is a small &quot;comune&quot; in the Metropolitan City of Palermo, in Sicily, southern Italy.

Is located in the &quot;Valle del Belìce&quot; at above sea level in the mountains called &quot;Brinjat&quot;, is situated 80 km from Palermo. The country, along with Piana degli Albanesi and Santa Cristina Gela, is among the three ethnic communities of Arbëreshë of Sicily, who still speak Albanian, carefully preserve the Orthodox rite, the Albanian costumes, musical and gastronomic traditions of the ancient Albania.

==History==

The foundation is attributed to about 1450 on the ruins of a remote farmhouse seniority, the &quot;Comitissa&quot;, but the chapter officers, the granting of fiefs, were built in 1520, when he started the rebuilding, upgrading and restocking of Albanians from Albania and subsequently also by the southern Morea, from Albanian communities where they lived from 1300.

In ancient times it was near them the ancient Elymian city of &quot;Entella&quot;, in fact, with the discovery of archaeological ancient site, to give relief to the old site, you would add the name of the country, even the term Entella.

Today Contessa Entellina keeps the Albanian language, the culture of their ancestors, and holds the Byzantine rite; but lives a very difficult period. From earthquake of Belice to date have followed many migrations, halving the population and depopulating the city center, the Albanian language is also taught to fewer and fewer young people so the community is constantly lost and the identity is dying.

<doc id="471842" wikidata="Q1469153" url="?curid=471842" title="Prime Minister of Fiji">
<text>The prime minister of Fiji is the head of government of the Republic of Fiji. The prime minister is appointed under the terms of the 2013 Constitution. The prime minister is the head of the Cabinet and appoints and dismisses ministers.

==Description of the office==
As a former British colony, Fiji has largely adopted British political models and follows the Westminster, or Cabinet, system of government, in which the executive branch of government is responsible to the legislature. Under the 2013 Constitution, the prime minister is the leader of the political party which has won more than half of the total number of seats in Parliament. If no such party exist, the Parliament elects the prime minister.

The prime minister of Fiji is technically the &quot;first among equals,&quot; whose vote in meetings of the Cabinet carries no greater weight than that of any other minister. In practice, the prime minister dominates the government. Other ministers are appointed by the prime minister.

==History of the office==
&quot;Ratu&quot; Sir Kamisese Mara was appointed Fiji&#x27;s first prime minister on 10 October 1970, when Fiji attained its independence from Britain. Mara previously served as Fiji&#x27;s first and only chief minister, from 20 September 1967 (while Fiji still was a British colony). Mara&#x27;s first term as prime minister lasted until 13 April 1987. He returned to the office for the second term on 5 December 1987, serving until 2 June 1992. As of 2014, Mara is the longest-serving prime minister of Fiji.
