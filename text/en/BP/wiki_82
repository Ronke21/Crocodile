<text>Point Break is a 1991 American action film directed by Kathryn Bigelow and written by W. Peter Iliff. It stars Patrick Swayze, Keanu Reeves, Lori Petty and Gary Busey. The film&#x27;s title refers to the surfing term &quot;point break&quot;, where a wave breaks as it hits a point of land jutting out from the coastline. The film features Reeves as an undercover FBI agent who is tasked with investigating the identities of a group of bank robbers while he develops a complex relationship with the group&#x27;s leader (Swayze).

Development of &quot;Point Break&quot; began in 1986, when Iliff wrote an initial treatment for the film. Bigelow soon developed the script with husband James Cameron, and filming took place four years later. It was shot across the western coast of the continental United States and was officially budgeted at $24 million, before being released on July 12, 1991.

&quot;Point Break&quot; opened to generally positive reviews, with critics praising the chemistry between Reeves and Swayze. During its theatrical run, the film grossed over $83.5 million, and has since gained a cult following. Following the film&#x27;s success, it spawned a remake that was released in 2015.

==Plot==
Former Ohio State quarterback and rookie FBI agent Johnny Utah assists senior Agent Angelo Pappas in investigating a string of bank robberies by the &quot;Ex-Presidents&quot;: robbers who wear rubber masks of former presidents Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, and Lyndon B. Johnson. Rather than robbing the vault, they only demand the cash the tellers have in their drawers and are gone within ninety seconds.

Pursuing Pappas&#x27;s theory that the criminals are surfers, Utah infiltrates the surfing community. He fabricates a family tragedy to persuade orphaned surfer and restaurant waitress Tyler to teach him to surf, after she saves him from drowning during his first attempt. Through her, he meets Bodhi, Tyler’s ex-boyfriend and the leader of a gang of surfers consisting of Roach, Grommet, and Nathaniel. The group is wary of Utah, but they accept him when Bodhi recalls how a knee injury derailed Utah&#x27;s football prospects. As he masters surfing, Utah finds himself drawn to the surfers&#x27; adrenaline-charged lifestyle, Bodhi&#x27;s philosophies, and Tyler. Following a clue retrieved by analyzing toxins found in the hair of one of the bank robbers, Utah and Pappas lead an FBI raid on another gang of surfers, resulting in the deaths of two of them. The raid inadvertently ruins a DEA undercover operation, as those surfers were wanted for separate charges regarding drug dealing, and they are determined not to be the Ex-Presidents.

Watching Bodhi&#x27;s group surfing, Utah begins to suspect that they are the Ex-Presidents, noting how close a group they are and the way one of them moons other surfers in the same manner one of the robbers does. Utah and Pappas stake out a bank, and the Ex-Presidents appear. While wearing a Reagan mask, Bodhi leads Utah on a foot chase through the neighborhood, which ends when Utah&#x27;s old injury flares up after he jumps into a flood control channel. Despite having a clear shot, the injured Utah allows Bodhi to escape.

At a campfire that night, it is confirmed that Bodhi and his gang are the Ex-Presidents. Tyler discovers Utah&#x27;s FBI badge and angrily terminates their relationship. Shortly afterward, Bodhi coerces Utah into skydiving with the group. After the jump, Bodhi reveals that he knows Utah is an FBI agent and has arranged for his friend Rosie, a non-surfing thug, to hold Tyler hostage to blackmail him into assisting the Ex-Presidents with their last bank robbery of the summer. During the robbery, they decide to infiltrate the vault, causing them to take longer than normal. Grommet is killed when an off-duty police officer and one of the bank security guards attempt to foil the robbery. The robbers kill the officer and security guard, then abandon Utah.

Pappas and Utah head to the airport where Bodhi, Roach, and Nathaniel are about to leave for Mexico. During a shootout, Pappas and Nathaniel are killed, and Roach is seriously wounded. With Roach aboard, Bodhi forces Utah onto the plane at gunpoint. Once airborne and over their intended drop zone, Bodhi and Roach put on their parachutes and jump from the plane, leaving Utah to take the blame. With no other parachutes available, Utah jumps from the plane with Bodhi&#x27;s gun and intercepts him mid-air. Despite landing safely, Utah&#x27;s knee gives out again, allowing Bodhi to escape. Bodhi meets with Rosie who frees Tyler; with Roach dead from his wounds, the two men flee the country and go their separate ways.

Nine months later, Utah tracks Bodhi to Bells Beach in Victoria, Australia, where a record-breaking storm is producing lethal waves. This is an event Bodhi had talked about experiencing, calling it the &quot;50-year storm.&quot; Bodhi begs Utah to release him so he can ride the once-in-a-lifetime wave, and Utah, knowing Bodhi will not come back alive, agrees and bids him farewell. As Bodhi surfs to his death, Utah walks away, throwing his FBI badge into the ocean.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film came close to production in 1986, with Matthew Broderick, Johnny Depp, Val Kilmer, and Charlie Sheen all being considered to play the Johnny Utah character, with Ridley Scott directing. However production fell through.

Four years later, after acquiring the screenplay, the producers of &quot;Point Break&quot; began looking for a director. At the time, executive producer James Cameron was married to director Kathryn Bigelow, who had just completed &quot;Blue Steel&quot; and was looking for her next project. Only W. Peter Iliff is credited for the screenplay, but Cameron has said that he did a considerable amount of writing with Bigelow for the final film, helping to establish a better plot flow. Cameron was also instrumental in the creation of the iconic Ex-Presidents.

&quot;Point Break&quot; was originally called &quot;Johnny Utah&quot; when Keanu Reeves was cast in the title role. The studio felt that this title said very little about surfing and by the time Patrick Swayze was cast, the film had been renamed &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot; after the famous song by The Doors. However, Jim Morrison&#x27;s lyrics had nothing to do with the film and so that title was also rejected. It was not until halfway through filming that &quot;Point Break&quot; became the film&#x27;s title because of its relevance to surfing.

Reeves liked the name of his character, as it reminded him of star athletes like Johnny Unitas and Joe Montana. He described his character as &quot;a total control freak and the ocean beats him up and challenges him. After a while everything becomes a game. He becomes as amoral as any criminal. He loses the difference between right and wrong.&quot; Swayze felt that Bodhi was a lot like him and that they both shared &quot;that wild-man edge.&quot;

Two months before filming, Lori Petty, Reeves and Swayze trained with former world-class professional surfer Dennis Jarvis on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Jarvis remembers, &quot;Patrick said he&#x27;d been on a board a couple of times, Keanu definitely had not surfed before, and Lori had never been in the ocean &quot;in her life&quot;.&quot; Shooting the surfing sequences proved to be challenging for all three actors, with Swayze cracking four of his ribs. For many of the surfing scenes, he refused to use a stunt double as he never had one for fight scenes or car chases. He also did the skydiving scenes himself and the film&#x27;s aerial jump instructor Jim Wallace found that he was a natural and took to it right away. Swayze ended up making 55 jumps for the film. Swayze admitted that he almost died six or ten times while shooting the film. Swayze actually based aspects of his character after one of his stunt doubles, Darrick Doerner, a top big wave surfer. After learning to surf for the film, Reeves took a liking to it and took it up as a hobby.

A few of the action scenes were shot from the POV of the characters and Bigelow along with the cinematographer devised an innovative light weight pogo cam to create a sense of immersion among the audience.

Parts of the film were shot at Lake Powell in Utah, Wheeler and Ecola State Park in Oregon, and Malibu, Manhattan Beach, Santa Monica, Venice, and Fox Hills Mall in California. Although the final scene of the film is set at Bells Beach, Victoria, Australia, the scene was filmed at Indian Beach in Ecola State Park, located in Cannon Beach, Oregon.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Point Break&quot; was released on July 12, 1991, in 1,615 theaters, grossing $8.5 million on its opening weekend, behind &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;″s (directed by Bigelow&#x27;s then husband, James Cameron) second weekend and the openings of the re-issue of &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; and &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot;. With a budget of $24 million, the film went on to make $43.2 million in North America and $40.3 million internationally for a worldwide total of $83.5 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 70% based on 79 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Absurd, over-the-top, and often wildly entertaining, &quot;Point Break&quot; is here to show you that the human spirit is still alive.&quot; Metacritic reports a weighted average score of 58 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, and wrote: &quot;Bigelow is an interesting director for this material. She is interested in the ways her characters live dangerously for philosophical reasons. They aren&#x27;t men of action, but men of thought who choose action as a way of expressing their beliefs.&quot; In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin praised Reeves&#x27;s performance: &quot;A lot of the snap comes, surprisingly, from Mr. Reeves, who displays considerable discipline and range. He moves easily between the buttoned-down demeanor that suits a police procedural story and the loose-jointed manner of his comic roles.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;C+&quot; rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote: &quot;&quot;Point Break&quot; makes those of us who don&#x27;t spend our lives searching for the ultimate physical rush feel like second-class citizens. The film turns reckless athletic valor into a new form of aristocracy.&quot;

In his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Hal Hinson wrote: &quot;A lot of what Bigelow puts up on the screen bypasses the brain altogether, plugging directly into our viscera, our gut. The surfing scenes in particular are majestically powerful, even awe-inspiring. Bigelow&#x27;s picture is a feast for the eyes, but we watch movies with more than our eyes. She seduces us, then asks us to be bimbos.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Peter Travers wrote: &quot;Bigelow can&#x27;t keep the film from drowning in a sea of surf-speak. But without her, &quot;Point Break&quot; would be no more than an excuse to ogle pretty boys in wet suits.&quot;

&quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film two out of four stars, and Mike Clark wrote: &quot;Its purely visceral material (surf sounds, skydiving stunt work, a tough indoor shootout midway through) are first-rate. As for the tangibles that matter even more (script, acting, directorial control, credible relationships between characters), Break defies belief. Dramatically, it rivals the lowest surf yet this year.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Richard Corliss wrote: &quot;So how do you rate a stunningly made film whose plot buys so blithely into macho mysticism that it threatens to turn into an endless bummer? Looks 10, Brains 3.&quot;

Critics have commented on the central &#x27;buddy&#x27; relationship of Bodhi and Johnny, and on the unusually equal dynamic in the romantic relationship of Tyler and Johnny (which Bigelow changed Peter Iliff&#x27;s original script to create); Tyler is a &quot;muscled, brash waitress with an androgynous name (Tyler) and physical features&quot;, and Johnny&#x27;s &quot;feminine edges nudge in nicely to her masculine ones. In nearly every scene they share, they are portrayed by the camera as equals.&quot;

In 2006, a special edition was released on DVD (In DVD was released on May 22, 2001). &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a &quot;B&quot; rating and wrote: &quot;The making-of docs (at their best discussing Swayze&#x27;s extracurricular skydiving—that really is him doing the &quot;Adios, amigo&quot; fall) will leave you hanging.&quot;

In 2021, Keith Duggan, reflecting on &quot;Point Break&quot; 30 years later, wrote in the &quot;Irish Times&quot;: 
==Legacy==
&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote that the film &quot;certainly qualified as a cult favourite.&quot;.&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called &quot;Point Break&quot; &quot;the greatest female-gaze action movie ever,&quot; citing the bodily condition of Reeves and Swayze, calling it a &quot;wet Western.&quot;

The 2001 film &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; was developed by Rob Cohen and Neal H. Moritz as a re-imagined version of &quot;Point Break&quot;, following Paul Walker as an undercover cop tasked with infiltrating the world of underground street racers instead of surfers, officially inspired by the 1998 &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine article &quot;Racer X&quot; by Ken Li.

&quot;Point Break&quot; was listed in the VH1 series &quot;I Love the 90s&quot; on the episode &quot;1991&quot;. Many celebrities, including Dominic Monaghan, Mo Rocca, Michael Ian Black, Hal Sparks and Chris Pontius commented about the film and why it deserved to be included in the episode. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked &quot;Point Break&quot; as having one of the &quot;10 Best Surfing Scenes&quot; in cinema.

The film inspired a piece of cult theater, &quot;Point Break Live!&quot;, in which the role of Johnny Utah is played by an audience member chosen by popular acclamation after a brief audition. The new &quot;Keanu&quot; reads all of his lines from cue-cards for the duration of the show, &quot;to capture the rawness of a Keanu Reeves performance even from those who generally think themselves incapable of acting.&quot;

&quot;Point Break&quot; was referenced in &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot;, where the scene of Utah emptying his magazine into the sky in frustration is watched by the lead characters and later re-enacted by Nick Frost&#x27;s character.

Seattle-based Georgetown Brewing Company brews a &quot;Bodhizafa&quot; IPA, a &quot;Johnny Utah&quot; pale ale, and a &quot;War Child&quot; IPA.

Between 2016 and 2020, indie musician JAWNY went by the stage name &quot;Johnny Utah&quot; in reference to the &quot;Point Break&quot; character.

In &quot;The Avengers&quot;, Tony Stark dismissively calls Thor &quot;Point Break,&quot; presumably a comparison of Thor&#x27;s hair to Swayze&#x27;s in that film. In &quot;&quot;, after several attempts Thor correctly guesses that &quot;Point Break&quot; is the activation code that Stark had set up for him in the Quinjet.

Alcon Entertainment and Warner Bros. released a remake of the film in 2015 titled &quot;Point Break&quot;, which received mostly negative reviews. James LeGros and BoJesse Christopher, two of the actors who played Ex-Presidents in the 1991 film, were cast as FBI directors.

<doc id="483275" wikidata="Q3550308" url="?curid=483275" title="Service Employees International Union">
<text>Service Employees International Union (SEIU) is a labor union representing almost 1.9 million workers in over 100 occupations in the United States and Canada. SEIU is focused on organizing workers in three sectors: healthcare (over half of members work in the healthcare field), including hospital, home care and nursing home workers; public services (government employees, including law enforcement); and property services (including janitors, security guards and food service workers).

SEIU has over 150 local branches. It is affiliated with the AFL-CIO, the Strategic Organizing Center, and the Canadian Labour Congress. SEIU&#x27;s international headquarters is located in Washington, D.C., and it is one of the largest unions in the country.

The union is known for its strong support for Democratic candidates. It spent $28 million supporting Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election. In 2012, SEIU was the top outside spender on Democratic campaigns, reporting almost $70 million of campaign donations, television ads and get-out-the-vote efforts in support of President Obama and other Democrats. SEIU is a major supporter of the Affordable Care Act and of increased minimum wage laws, including wage increases for fast food workers. The union is the primary backer of the Fight for $15.

==History==
The SEIU was founded on April 23, 1921 in Chicago as the Building Service Employees International Union (BSEIU); its first members were janitors, elevator operators, and window washers. The union&#x27;s membership increased significantly with a 1934 strike in New York City&#x27;s Garment District. In order to reflect its increasingly diversified membership, in 1968 the union renamed itself Service Employees International Union. In 1980 through 1984, most of the SEIU&#x27;s growth came from mergers with four other unions, including the International Jewelry Workers&#x27; Union and the Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union.

In 1995, SEIU President John Sweeney was elected president of the AFL–CIO, the main confederation of labor unions in the United States. After Sweeney&#x27;s departure, former social worker Andrew Stern was elected president of SEIU. In the first ten years of Stern&#x27;s administration, the union&#x27;s membership grew rapidly and the SEIU became the largest union in the AFL–CIO.

In 2003, SEIU was a founding member of the New Unity Partnership, an organization of unions that pushed for a greater commitment to organizing unorganized workers into unions. In 2005, SEIU was a founding member of the Change to Win Coalition, which furthered the reformist agenda. Their differences with AFL-CIO boiled over on the eve of the 2005 AFL–CIO convention, as the SEIU and Teamsters announced that they were disaffiliating from the AFL–CIO, and boycotting the convention. The Change to Win Federation held its founding convention in September 2005, where SEIU Secretary-Treasurer Anna Burger was announced as the organization&#x27;s chair.

In the following decade, several Change to Win members disaffiliated and re-joined the AFL–CIO, leaving SEIU, the Teamsters, and the United Farm Workers as the remaining members. The SEIU&#x27;s decision to break away from the AFL–CIO is considered controversial by some labor experts. After the disaffiliation, the SEIU continued to experience significant growth in membership. Stern stepped down as president of SEIU in 2010, and was replaced by Mary Kay Henry, a long-time organizer and staff member at the union, and its first female president.

April Verrett was elected the union&#x27;s first Black president in May 2024.

On January 8, 2025, the SEIU announced that they are re-joining the AFL-CIO after a 20-year absence, bringing the total membership of the AFL-CIO to nearly 15 million members. 
===Presidents of SEIU===
* William Quesse (1921–1927)
* Oscar Nelson (1927)
* Jerry Horan (1927–1937)
* George Scalise (1937–1940)
* William McFetridge (1940–1960)
* David Sullivan (1960–1971)
* George Hardy (1971–1980)
* John Sweeney (1980–1995; subsequently president of the AFL–CIO)
* Richard Cordtz (1995–1996)
* Andy Stern (1996–2010)
* Mary Kay Henry (2010–2024)
* April Verrett (2024—present)

==Organizing and political activities==

Under the Stern and Henry presidencies, SEIU has organized workers in a number of industries. In some cases, these organizing drives have been built around nationwide campaigns, like the earlier Justice for Janitors campaign. SEIU has organized large numbers of home care attendants in Oregon, Missouri, and Wisconsin,
among other states, in some cases working together with other unions.

Since 2004, the union has seen success organizing workers in Texas, Florida, Nevada, and Arizona in particular. Over 5,000 janitors organized with SEIU in Houston, Texas in 2005, which was especially significant due to the size of the campaign and its location in an area with low union density. In Florida, a high-profile strike at the University of Miami which lasted nine weeks and included a hunger strike, ended with the union winning representation of 425 janitors on campus. This victory was shortly followed by another 600 workers at North Shore Medical Center, also in Miami, voting to join the SEIU in early 2006.

One of the major potential areas of union growth in the United States is organizing workers usually hitherto considered &quot;unorganizable,&quot; especially low-wage service sector workers, in what is often called &quot;social movement organizing.&quot; SEIU has played a major role in the fast food worker strikes from 2012–2014 and has contributed more than $15 million to workers&#x27; centers and community organizations to organize them. The motto for the campaign is &quot;$15 and a union,&quot; reflecting the call to increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour and the unionization of fast food workers. SEIU has recently begun supporting lawsuits filed by fast food workers to the National Labor Relations Board, calling for McDonald&#x27;s to be named a joint employer of the restaurants run by its franchisees, a move which would make it substantially easier to unionize McDonald&#x27;s employees. Adjunct faculty at colleges and universities have been part of a similar campaign.

In June 2004, SEIU launched a non-union-member affiliate group called Purple Ocean as a mechanism to mobilize non-SEIU members in support of the union&#x27;s agenda. Purple Ocean members do not have voting rights within the SEIU.

In November 2009, the SEIU and the National Union of Healthcare Workers (NUHW) competed for the right to represent 10,000 home health-care workers in Fresno, California. After the SEIU won the right to represent the workers, the NUHW charged the SEIU with changing ballots and threatening to report a worker to immigration officials. The NUHW asked that the election be invalidated and a new one ordered due to what it said was evidence of intimidation.

In 2012, SEIU, the American Federation of Teachers and AFSCME agreed on a politics-only alliance for the 2012 national election campaign. In 2016, AFSCME and SEIU announced an extension of that agreement, leading to speculation about a possible future merger.

In January 2015, the SEIU endorsed Hillary Clinton as the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee for the US Presidency, despite her opposition to the union&#x27;s flagship &quot;Fight for $15&quot; campaign.

In July 2020, three SEIU members, Felix Thomson, Julia Wallace, and Mark Ostapiak, published an article in the media and organizing forum &quot;Labor Notes&quot; describing their participation in a campaign to disaffiliate police unions from the SEIU. 

The Service Employees International Union challenged California&#x27;s Proposition 22. The proposition was initially overturned in the lower courts before the decision was reversed in the Court of Appeal.

On November 15, 2023, President Joe Biden nominated Nicole Berner, the general counsel of the SEIU, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.

===Sodexo===
In 2009, the union launched a nationwide campaign against Sodexo, criticizing the company&#x27;s labor standards. The union&#x27;s strategy, which was ultimately unsuccessful, involved organizing student groups to pressure administrators at universities to kick Sodexo out of school cafeterias unless the company permitted unionization. Sodexo USA filed a civil lawsuit against SEIU under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act on March 17, 2011. In the complaint, Sodexo alleged that SEIU engaged in blackmail, vandalism, trespassing, harassment, and lobbying law violations, referring to the &quot;Clean Up Sodexo&quot; campaign as &quot;old-fashioned, strongarm tactics&quot; and SEIU behavior as &quot;egregious&quot; and &quot;illegal.&quot;

During the trial, it was revealed that in 1988, the SEIU had co-written a manual detailing how &quot;outside pressure can involve jeopardizing relationships between the employer and lenders, investors, stockholders, customers, clients, patients, tenants, politicians, or others on whom the employer depends for funds.&quot; Tactics recommended include references to blackmail and extortion, accusations of racism and sexism, targeting the homes and neighborhoods of business leaders for demonstrations, and also explicitly stated that at times it is necessary to &quot;disobey the law.&quot; Following the court discovery of this document, a settlement was reached where Sodexo withdrew the lawsuit and SEIU terminated its public campaign focused on Sodexo.

===Political donations===
According to OpenSecrets, since 1990 the SEIU has been the nation&#x27;s top organization contributing to federal campaigns, donating $232,694,670, 99 percent of which went to Democrats. Over that same period, the National Education Association was the second highest organizational political donor, contributing $96,992,506, 97 percent of which went to Democrats. Since 1998, the SEIU has spent $19,676,660 in additional money on lobbying.

==Local unions==
===1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East===
SEIU&#x27;s largest local union is 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East. With a membership of roughly 300,000, it is the second-largest union in the United States. It represents workers in various parts of New York state, chiefly in New York City, but also along the East Coast of the United States.

===United Healthcare Workers West===

SEIU Local 2005 United Healthcare Workers West (UHW West) is a large (150,000-member) local union based in Oakland, California. In August 2008, the international union announced plans for a hearing to consider trusteeing UHW West. On January 27, 2009, SEIU placed UHW West under trusteeship and dismissed 70 of the local&#x27;s executives, including president Sal Rosselli. Rosselli and other ousted leaders reformed under the name National Union of Healthcare Workers and pushed for UHW West members at 60 facilities to vote to decertify SEIU. As of 2012, NUHW only represents 6 former SEIU-UHW facilities.

In early 2013, NUHW affiliated with the California Nurses Association. Also, in early 2013, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ordered that the results of the 2010 Kaiser Permanente union election (a vote by nearly 45,000 Kaiser-Permanente employees choosing between NUHW and SEIU-UHW) be overturned based on evidence of collusion between SEIU-UHW and the employer. The second election was won be SEIU-UHW, by a vote of 18,844 to 13,101.

===Local 32BJ===

SEIU 32BJ is a politically outspoken building services local based in New York. 32BJ represents over 170,000 property service workers, and is part of SEIU Justice for Janitors, Stand for Security and Multi Service Workers campaigns.

In 2010, SEIU 32BJ&#x27;s Thomas Shortman Training Fund was awarded a $2.8 million grant by the Department of Labor, as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act aiming to create jobs in expanding green industries over the following two years. The program (1,000 Green Supers) was intended to help train 2,200 New York City building superintendents in energy efficiency.

The National Conference of Firemen and Oilers is an affiliate of 32BJ.

===Local 87===
One of the first SEIU locals was Local 87, a local union that traces its origins back to the 1920s, when it was known as Local 9 of the Building Service Employees International Union (BSEIU). It was originally led by George Hardy. Around 700 janitorial members of the local launched a walk-off on March 24, 2021, striking in favor of workplace safety measures including &quot;sexual harassment safeguards&quot;, of fair pay, and of seniority rights. The strike follows 8 months of contract negotiations, 27 deaths to COVID-19 among union members, and 3000 members laid off since the start of the pandemic.

===Local 721===
SEIU Local 721 is Los Angeles County&#x27;s largest employee union, representing 57,000 county employees in nursing, social work, and clerical roles. https://www.seiu721.org/

===Local 2015===
SEIU Local 2015 represents 425,000 long-term care employees, making it the largest local union in California and the second largest in the United States. In November 2022, Local 2015 staff went on strike against the union in one of the largest union staff strikes in history.

===Local 1000===
SEIU Local 1000 (Union of California State Workers) is affiliated with the California State Employees Association (CSEA) with one other union, the California State University Employees Union, SEIU Local 2579, a non-union affiliate of managers, confidential and supervisory employees who are excluded from collective bargaining, and an affiliate of retired state employees. Yvonne Walker has been president since 2008. SEIU Local 1000 represents 95000 State Government Employees, many of whom are office and administrative workers, librarians, engineers and nurses. Local 1000 deals with issues of concern to current rank-and-file state employees, such as salaries, benefits, working conditions and contract negotiations. Local 1000 has nine bargaining units and represents a variety of state workers, including DMV employees, prison support staff (excluding uniformed guards), information technology workers, nurses and administrative staff.

In &quot;Knox v. Service Employees International Union, Local 1000&quot;, the US Supreme Court found Local 1000 had used illegal fundraising during the 2005 California Special Election.

===Committee of Interns and Residents===
Committee of Interns and Residents Local 1957 is the largest housestaff union in the United States.

===National Association of Government Employees (NAGE)===

The National Association of Government Employees (NAGE), SEIU Local 5000, represents tens of thousands of state, federal, and municipal government employees including nurses, EMS professionals, firefighters, police and correctional officers, and military air technicians.

===SEIU Healthcare (Local 1 Canada)===

The largest local in Canada is SEIU Healthcare, formerly known as SEIU Local 1 Canada. It represents over 50,000 health care and community services workers in Ontario and British Columbia. Its members work in hospitals, home care, nursing and retirement homes and community services. In 2013 the union was re-branded SEIU Healthcare.

==Composition==

According to SEIU&#x27;s Department of Labor records since 2005 (when membership classifications were first reported) about two percent of the union&#x27;s membership are considered retirees, with eligibility to vote in the union. SEIU contracts also cover some non-members, known as agency fee payers, which since 2005 have numbered comparatively about one tenth of the size of the union&#x27;s membership. As of 2014 this accounts for about 35,000 retirees and about 180,000 non-members paying agency fees, compared to about 1.8 million regular members.

==Archival and historical materials==
The official repository of SEIU is the Walter P. Reuther Library of Labor and Urban Affairs at Wayne State University in Detroit. The Reuther Library, the largest labor archives in North America, holds the most complete collection of primary source materials regarding SEIU with over 1,000 linear feet of the union&#x27;s records covering 105 years of history (1905-2010). The SEIU Collections include a variety of organizational, executive, photographic, and publicity materials along with many other additional record types. The relationship between SEIU and the Reuther Library began officially in 1992 and the collections have since been maintained by a dedicated SEIU Archivist on staff at the archives. Notable collections include SEIU Executive Office: John Sweeney Records, the District 925 Records, and materials documenting the Justice for Janitors campaign from SEIU&#x27;s numerous local affiliates.

Additional archival collections can be found at the Special Collections Library of the University of Washington (Building Service Employees&#x27; International Union, Local 6 Records and Service Employees International Union, Local 120 Records). The records of SEIU&#x27;s United Service Workers West, including the Justice for Janitors campaign are held by the UCLA Library Department of Special Collections.

<text>Thomson Financial was an arm of the Thomson Corporation, an information provider. When the Thomson Corporation merged with Reuters to form Thomson Reuters in April 2008, Thomson Financial was merged with the business of Reuters to form the Markets Division of Thomson Reuters.

== History ==
Thomson acquired magazine publisher Faulkner &amp; Gray in 1992. Thomson Financial expanded significantly when it acquired Primark, another financial information provider, on June 6, 2000, for $842 million in an all-cash deal. Primark owned many brands in both the U.S. and UK/Europe such as Datastream, Baseline Financial, Intellivate Capital Ventures (ICV), and IBES. The acquisition consolidated and combined competing financial information provision, for example the FirstCall and IBES earnings estimate data, under the same company.

Thomson Financial sold its Thomson Media division in 2004.

On 17 April 2008 the Thomson Corporation merged with Reuters and created the new company Thomson Reuters. Thomson Financial and Reuters combined their businesses into the Markets Division: Sales &amp; Trading, Enterprise, Investment &amp; Advisory, and Media. The other Thomson operations were combined into the Professional Division: Legal, Healthcare &amp; Science, and Tax &amp; Accounting. Thomson Reuters Financial &amp; Risk eventually became Refinitiv.

==Major office locations==
Thomson Financial had many offices across the US, Europe, and Asia Pacific regions. The head office was based in Boston (1987-2008) and New York (joint with Boston), with significant presence in San Francisco, London, Frankfurt, Bangalore, Manila, and many satellite offices in locations such as Sydney, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Zurich, Geneva, just as some examples. The two major data centers, not including smaller points of presence, for Thomson Financial were located in NYC and New Jersey.

In June 2007, Thomson Financial agreed to buy seven Asia-Pacific news bureaus from Xinhua Finance. The bureaus purchased were in Tokyo, Manila, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Sydney and Seoul. Xinhua Finance stated they would retain their operations in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Taipei. Financial terms were not disclosed.

==Products==

The company had a wide variety of financial products. Thomson ONE is a core product, although legacy branded offerings such as &quot;Datastream Advance&quot; and &quot;Global Topic&quot; will probably remain for a few years. Thomson ONE was a competitor of Bloomberg L.P., Capital IQ and FactSet Research Systems. There were different packages of Thomson ONE, i.e., Thomson ONE for Investment Management, Thomson ONE for Investment Banking, etc. Due to the acquisition of Primark and buyout of ILX Systems, Thomson Financial had seen growth over the previous four years and had seen improvement in the core product Thomson ONE.

Thomson Financial electronic transaction processing systems included Thomson AutEx trade order indications and executions, Thomson PORTIA automated portfolio management system, Thomson TradeWeb on-line trading network for fixed-income securities, and Thomson BETA Systems for securities data and brokerage processing systems.

<doc id="483289" wikidata="Q2922301" url="?curid=483289" title="Humming">
<text>A hum is a sound made by producing a wordless tone with the mouth closed, forcing the sound to emerge from the nose. To hum is to produce such a sound, often with a melody. It is also associated with thoughtful absorption, &#x27;hmm&#x27;.

A hum has a particular timbre (or sound quality), usually a monotone or with slightly varying tones. There are other similar sounds not produced by human singing that are also called hums, as the sound produced by machinery in operation, such as a microwave, or by an insect in flight. The hummingbird was named for the sound that bird makes in flight which sounds like a hum.

==Mechanics==

A &#x27;hum&#x27; or &#x27;humming&#x27; by humans is created by the resonance of air in various parts of passages in the head and throat, in the act of breathing. The &#x27;hum&#x27; that a hummingbird creates is also created by resonance: in this case by air resistance against wings in the actions of flying, especially of hovering.

==Humming in human evolution==
Joseph Jordania suggested that humming could have played an important role in the early human (hominid) evolution as contact calls. Many social animals produce seemingly haphazard and indistinct sounds (like chicken cluck) when they are going about their everyday business (foraging, feeding). These sounds let group members know that they are among kin and there is no danger. In the case of the appearance of any signs of danger (such as suspicious sounds or movements in a forest), the animal that notices danger first, stops moving, stops producing sounds, remains silent and looks in the direction of the danger sign. Other animals quickly follow suit and very soon all the group is silent and is scanning the environment for possible danger.

Charles Darwin was the first to notice this phenomenon on the example of the wild horses and the cattle. Joseph Jordania suggested that for humans, as for many social animals, silence can be a sign of danger, and that&#x27;s why gentle humming and musical sounds relax humans (see the use of gentle music in music therapy, lullabies).

==Humming in language==
In Pirahã, the only surviving dialect of the Mura language, there is a special register of speech which uses solely humming, with no audible release.

== Music ==

Humming is often used in music of genres, from classical (for example, the famous chorus at the end of Act 2 of Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;) to jazz to R&amp;B.

Another form of music derived from basic humming is the humwhistle. Folk art, also known as &quot;whistle-hum,&quot; produces a high pitch and low pitch simultaneously. The two-tone sound is related to field holler, overtone singing, and yodeling the music.

<doc id="483292" wikidata="Q459886" url="?curid=483292" title="Petting zoo">
<text>A petting zoo (also called a children&#x27;s zoo, children&#x27;s farm, or petting farm) features a combination of domesticated animals and some wild species that are docile enough to touch and feed. In addition to independent petting zoos, many general zoos contain a petting zoo.

Most petting zoos are designed to provide only relatively placid, herbivorous domesticated animals, such as sheep, goats, rabbits, ponies and donkeys to feed and interact physically with safety. This is in contrast to the usual zoo experience, where normally wild animals are viewed from behind safe enclosures where no contact is possible. A few provide wild species (such as pythons or big cat cubs) to interact with, but these are rare and usually found outside Western nations.

==History==
In 1938, the London Zoo included the first &quot;children&#x27;s zoo&quot; in Europe and the Philadelphia Zoo was the first in North America to open a special zoo just for children.

During the 1990s, Dutch cities began building petting zoos in many neighbourhoods, so that urban children could interact with animals.

==Animals and food==
Petting zoos feature a variety of domestic animals. Common animals include cattle, zebu, yaks, sheep, goats, rabbits, guinea pigs, ponies, alpacas, llamas, pigs, miniature donkeys, miniature horses, ducks, geese, chickens, and turkeys. They occasionally contain a few exotic animals such as kangaroos, wallabies, emus, deer, zebras, parrots, porcupines, camels, ostriches, bison, water buffaloes, rheas, peafowl, guineafowl, antelopes, capybaras, lemurs, tortoises and many others.

Petting zoos are popular with small children, who will often feed the animals. In order to ensure the animals&#x27; health, the food is supplied by the zoo, either from vending machines or a kiosk. Food often fed to animals includes grass and crackers and also in selected feeding areas hay is a common food. Such feeding is an exception to the usual rule about not feeding animals.

== Mobile petting zoos ==
Some petting zoos are also mobile and will travel to a home for a children&#x27;s party or event. Many areas have a qualified mobile petting zoo. One of the first mobile petting zoos in Australia (begun in 1992), was Kindifarm. As a result of its popularity, many Australians use the term &quot;kindy farms&quot; to describe petting zoos. In Australia, mobile petting zoos are allowed in schools, child care centres and even shopping centres. For many children, a mobile petting zoo is their first opportunity to see and touch an animal. American mobile petting zoos have gained popularity in the southern states.

== Health effects ==
Touching animals can result in the transmission of diseases between animals and humans (zoonosis) so it is recommended that people should thoroughly wash their hands before and after touching the animals. There have been several outbreaks of &quot;E. coli&quot; etc. Another threat is salmonella specifically from chicks handled by children. Petting zoo attendees under the age of 5 are at a higher risk of contracting these diseases and they are a major target audience of these petting zoos.

<text>Emil Zátopek (; 19 September 1922 – 21 November 2000) was a Czech long-distance runner best known for winning three gold medals at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. He won gold in the 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres runs, but his final medal came when he decided at the last minute to compete in the first marathon of his life. He was nicknamed the &quot;Czech Locomotive&quot;.

In 1954, Zátopek was the first runner to break the 29-minute barrier in the 10,000 metres. Three years earlier in 1951, he had broken the hour for running 20 km. He was considered one of the greatest runners of the 20th century and was also known for his brutally tough training methods. He popularised interval training after World War Two.

In February 2013, the editors at &quot;Runner&#x27;s World&quot; Magazine selected him as the Greatest Runner of All Time. He is the only person to win the 5,000 metres (24 July 1952), 10,000 metres (20 July 1952) and Marathon (27 July 1952), in the same Olympic Games.

==Early years==
Zátopek was born as the seventh child into a family of modest means. Aged 16, he began working at the Bata shoe factory in Zlín. Zátopek recalled that &quot;One day, the factory sports coach, who was very strict, pointed at four boys, including me, and ordered us to run in a race. I protested that I was weak and not fit to run, but the coach sent me for a physical examination, and the doctor said that I was perfectly well. So I had to run, and when I got started, I felt I wanted to win. But I only came in second. That was the way it started.&quot; Zátopek finished second in a field of 100. After that, he took up a serious interest in running. He joined a local athletic club where he developed his own training program modeled on what he had read about the great Finnish Olympian Paavo Nurmi.

A mere four years later, in 1944, Zátopek broke the Czechoslovak records for 2,000, 3,000 and 5,000 metres. At the end of the war he joined the Czechoslovak Army, where he was gradually given more time for his gruelling training regimen.

==Competitions==

Zátopek was selected for the Czechoslovak national team for the 1946 European Championships in Oslo and finished fifth in the 5,000 m in 14:25.8, breaking his own Czechoslovak record of 14:50.2. At the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, Zátopek won the 10,000 m and finished second behind Gaston Reiff from Belgium during a driving rainstorm in the 5,000 m.

The following year, Zátopek broke the 10,000 m world record twice, and went on to better his own record three times over the next four seasons. He also set records in the 5,000 m (1954), 20,000 m (twice in 1951), one-hour run (twice in 1951), 25,000 m (1952 and 1955), and 30,000 m (1952). He won the 5,000 m and 10,000 m at the 1950 European Championships and the 10,000 m at the next European Championships, ahead of Jozsef Kovacs and Frank Sando.

At the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Zátopek won gold in the 5,000 m, 10,000 m, and the marathon, breaking Olympic records in each event. Zátopek is the only person to win these three long-distance events in the same Olympic games. His victory in the 5,000 m came after a ferocious last lap in 57.5 seconds, during which he went from fourth place to first in the final turn, passing first Alain Mimoun of France, then Herbert Schade of West Germany, and finally Chris Chataway of Great Britain. Zátopek&#x27;s final medal came when he decided at the last minute to compete in the marathon for the first time in his life, and won. His strategy for the marathon was simple: he raced alongside Jim Peters, the British world-record holder. After a punishing first fifteen kilometres, in which Peters knew he had overtaxed himself, Zátopek asked the Englishman what he thought of the race thus far. The astonished Peters told the Czech that the pace was &quot;too slow,&quot; in an attempt to slip up Zátopek, at which point Zátopek simply accelerated. Peters did not finish, while Zátopek won the race and set an Olympic record. Zátopek running in his first Marathon, beat second placed Reinaldo Gorno (Argentina) by 2:01 minutes.

Zátopek attempted to defend his marathon gold medal in 1956; however, he suffered a groin injury while training and was hospitalized for six weeks. He resumed training the day after leaving hospital, but never quite regained his form. He finished sixth in the marathon, which was won by his old rival and friend Alain Mimoun. Zátopek retired from competition in 1957.

Zátopek&#x27;s running style was distinctive and very much at odds with what was considered to be an efficient style at the time. His head would often roll, face contorted with effort, while his torso swung from side to side. He often wheezed and panted audibly while running, which earned him the nicknames of &quot;Emil the Terrible&quot; or the &quot;Czech Locomotive&quot;. When asked about his tortured facial expressions, Zátopek is said to have replied that &quot;It isn&#x27;t gymnastics or figure skating, you know.&quot; In addition he would train in any weather, including snow, and would often do so while wearing heavy work boots as opposed to special running shoes. He was always willing to give advice to other runners. One example he often gave was always to be relaxed and to help ensure that while running, gently touch the tip of your thumb with the tip of your index or middle finger. Just making that slight contact would ensure that arms and shoulders remained relaxed.
==Personal life==
His wife Dana Zátopková (born the same day and year as her husband) won a gold medal in the javelin throw at the 1952 Olympics, only a few moments after Emil&#x27;s victory in the 5,000 m; she finished second at the 1960 Olympics. An example of the playful relationship between husband and wife came when Emil attempted to take some credit for his wife&#x27;s Olympic victory at her press conference, claiming that it was his victory in the 5,000 m that had &quot;inspired&quot; her. Dana&#x27;s indignant response was, &quot;Really? Okay, go inspire some other girl and see if &quot;she&quot; throws a javelin fifty metres!&quot;.

Zátopek was known for his friendly and gregarious personality and for his ability to speak six languages. He was regularly visited at his home in Prague by international athletes he had befriended at competitions. His British rival Gordon Pirie described his as &quot;the merriest and gayest home I&#x27;ve been in&quot;.

Emil and Dana were the witnesses at the wedding ceremony of Olympic gold medalists Olga Fikotová and Harold Connolly in Prague in 1957. Emil had spoken to the Czechoslovak president Antonín Zápotocký to request help in getting national heroine Olga a permit to marry the American Connolly, at the height of the Cold War. While it&#x27;s not clear how much this helped, they unexpectedly received a permit a few days later.

In 1966, Zátopek hosted the Australian Ron Clarke when he visited Prague for a race. Zátopek knew the bad luck that Clarke had faced; he held many middle-distance track and field world records and had attempted to join his idol in the record books, but had fallen short in winning an Olympic gold medal (he was beaten by Billy Mills in one of the biggest upsets in Olympic history). At the end of the visit, Zátopek gave one of his gold medals from the 1952 Olympics to Clarke.

==Later years and death==
A hero in his native country, Zátopek was an influential figure in the Communist Party. However, he supported the party&#x27;s democratic wing and, after the 1968 Prague Spring, he was stripped of his rank and expelled from the army and the party, removed from all important positions and forced to work in a string of menial manual labour positions.

He gained employment in one of the few companies not discouraged from employing out-of-favour citizens. The company was &quot;Stavební Geologie&quot;, and he was immediately put to work prospecting for natural resources around Bohemia, infrequently being able to visit his wife in Prague. His work in such a field gave rise to the rumour that he had been sent (as many before him were) to the uranium mine labour camps; however, the camps and the last of the mines had closed many years before. It is also rumoured that Zátopek had a short stint at refuse collection, but was let go as he was unable to complete a round without a horde of citizens insisting on helping him, though no evidence exists of this ever happening.

In 1977, after 5 years of working and living away from his wife and friends, Zátopek&#x27;s spirit was broken and the communist government, no longer deeming him a threat, allowed him back to Prague with the offer of a further humiliating and menial job in the ČSTV (Czechoslovak Union of Physical Education). As the only option to get back to Prague and his wife, Zátopek accepted the offer. Using his gift as a linguist, the ČSTV put him to work monitoring foreign publications for the latest developments in sports science and training techniques. It was a lowly job shuffling papers in a small office under Strahov stadium. He dutifully served until his retirement in the early 1980s.

On 9 March 1990, Zátopek was rehabilitated by Václav Havel.

Zátopek died in Prague on 21 November 2000 at the age of 78, from the complications of a stroke. His funeral at Prague&#x27;s National Theatre was crowded with leading figures from the international sports world.

Zátopek was awarded the Pierre de Coubertin medal (the &quot;True Spirit of Sportsmanship&quot; medal) in 1975. In 2012, he was named among the first twelve athletes to be inducted into the IAAF Hall of Fame. A life-size bronze statue of Zátopek was unveiled at the Stadium of Youth in Zlín in September 2014.

==In popular culture==
The 2021 film &quot;Zátopek&quot; focuses on his personal life and sports career.

The most prestigious track race in Australia is named after him.

French writer Jean Echenoz published a novelized biography of Zátopek titled &quot;Courir&quot; (Running).

A Bengali novel by Mati Nandi, Naran (নারান), mentioned him as the role model and motivation of the protagonist, a Bengali Hindu refugee from East Pakistan who relocated to Calcutta in 1947 in order to evade the religious onslaught and build up his life again from scratch.

The song &quot;Czech Locomotive&quot; by Australian psychedelic rock band Pond off of their album &quot;9&quot; is about him.

British punk-rock band Zatopeks chose their name after Emil Zátopek.

Škoda Transportation named its electric locomotive family 109E after him.

<text>Sean Michael Elliott (born February 2, 1968) is an American former professional basketball player who starred as a small forward in both the college and professional ranks. He attended the University of Arizona, where he had a standout career as a two-time All-American, winner of the 1989 John R. Wooden Award, the 1989 Adolph Rupp Trophy, the 1989 NABC Player of the Year, 1989 AP Player of the Year, and two time Pac-12 Player of the Year (in 1988–1989).

Elliott was the third pick of the 1989 NBA draft, was named to the 1990 NBA All-Rookie Second Team, was a two-time NBA All-Star, and earned an NBA championship in 1999. His No. 32 is retired by both the University of Arizona and the San Antonio Spurs.

==Early life==
Elliott was born in Tucson, Arizona, as the youngest of three boys. He attended the G.A.T.E. (Gifted and Talented Education) program at Tolson Elementary School there, then played basketball at Cholla High School (now Cholla High Magnet School) on the city&#x27;s west side.

==College==
After graduating in 1985, he remained in Tucson to play college basketball at the University of Arizona. Under the tutelage of Lute Olson, Elliott was named Pac-10 Freshman of the Year. He was selected as a consensus all-American during his junior and senior years, and led the Wildcats to the Final Four in his junior year (1988). Elliott broke Lew Alcindor&#x27;s (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) all time Pac-10 career scoring record. After an exceptional senior season, Elliott won the Wooden Award. He is still the University of Arizona&#x27;s all-time leading scorer.

He played for the US national team in the 1986 FIBA World Championship, winning the gold medal.

==NBA career==
===San Antonio Spurs (1989–1993)===
Elliott was drafted by the San Antonio Spurs as the third pick in the first round of the 1989 NBA draft. Elliot started in 69 of 81 games for the season and averaged 10 points a game. The Spurs made the playoffs where they swept the Denver Nuggets in the first round before falling to the eventual Western Conference Champion Portland Trail Blazers in 7 games.

In the following season, Elliott was moved to the permanent starting line-up and increased his scoring to 15.9 points a game. The Spurs won 55 games but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Golden State Warriors in four games. Elliott averaged 16.3 points per game during the 1991–92 season but San Antonio were swept in the first round by the Phoenix Suns.

During the 1992–93 season, Elliott averaged 17.2 points per game, including a career-high 41 points against the Dallas Mavericks on December 18, 1992. He was named to play in the 1993 NBA All-Star Game alongside teammate David Robinson. In the playoffs, San Antonio defeated Portland 3 games to 1, before facing the number one seeded Suns in the conference semifinal. After losing the first two games in Phoenix, the Spurs responded with consecutive games at home, as Elliott scored 17 points in game 3 and 19 points in game 4. The Suns managed to wrap up the series in the next two games. Elliot averaged 15.8 points per game in the playoffs.

===Detroit Pistons (1993–1994)===
Elliott spent the 1993–94 season with the Detroit Pistons after being traded for Dennis Rodman in a multi-player deal. After Elliott struggled with the Pistons, the Pistons attempted to trade him to the eventual champion Houston Rockets in February 1994 in exchange for Robert Horry, Matt Bullard and two second-round draft choices; the trade fell through when Elliott failed his physical. After the trade was voided, Elliott held a press conference and announced that he had a kidney problem. Elliott remained in Detroit for the rest of the season and averaged 12.1 points per game. Following the end of the season, he was traded back to the Spurs for the draft rights of Bill Curley.

===Return to San Antonio Spurs (1994–1998)===
In the 1994–1995 season, the Spurs won 62 games under the leadership of Elliott and the season&#x27;s NBA Most Valuable Player Robinson. The Spurs clinched the top seed in the Western Conference, and swept the Denver Nuggets in the first round before facing the young Los Angeles Lakers in the semifinals. Elliott scored 26 points – his high for the playoffs – in the series-clinching game against the Lakers. The Spurs lost to the Houston Rockets in the conference finals.

The 1995–1996 season was a personal best for Elliott, as he averaged 20 points a game, a career high, in 77 games. Elliott also made a career-high 161 three-pointers on the season. He played in the 1996 NBA All-Star Game and scored 13 points. The following season, Elliott suffered injuries that limited him to 39 games. Injuries limited him again to just 36 games in the 1997–1998 season.

===NBA championship, kidney transplant, and comeback (1998–2001)===
The 1998–1999 season was shortened to 50 games as a result of a league lockout, but the Spurs won 37 of the games for the west&#x27;s best record led by Duncan and Robinson, with Elliott starting in all 50 games with an average of 11.2 points a game. The Spurs defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves and Los Angeles Lakers to face the Portland Trail Blazers in the conference finals. During game 2, the Trail Blazers held a 2-point lead with 9 seconds left to play in regulation. Elliott received a pass nearly stolen by Blazer Stacey Augmon in the corner, before Elliott caught the ball within an inch of the sideline. He managed to stay on his tiptoes rather than planting his feet, before releasing a 21-foot three-point attempt just over the outstretched arms of 6 foot 11 forward Rasheed Wallace. The shot went in, giving the Spurs a 1-point lead and the eventual victory. The shot was named the &quot;Memorial Day Miracle&quot; because of its improbability and the date on which it was made. Elliott finished the game with 22 points. The Spurs made the NBA Finals and faced the New York Knicks. The Spurs defeated the Knicks in five games to win their first NBA Championship. Elliott averaged 11.9 points in 17 games in the playoffs while shooting 40 percent from beyond the three-point arc.

Shortly after the championship run, Elliott announced that he had a kidney disease known as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, that his kidney function was worsening, and that he would require a transplant as soon as a matching donor became available. Elliott also disclosed that he had been aware of his kidney ailment since 1993. He underwent surgery on August 16, 1999, after he received a kidney from his older brother, Noel.

On March 13, 2000, in a game against the Atlanta Hawks, Elliott became the first professional athlete to return to his sport after the kidney transplant. He played in only 19 games in the 1999–2000 season. Elliott started in 34 of 52 games in the 2000–2001 season; the Spurs held the best record in the league, but lost to the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Finals.

===Retirement===
Elliott announced his retirement in 2001. He finished his career averaging 14.2 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game. Elliott is the fifth all-time franchise leader in three-point field goals made (563) and fourth for three-point attempts (1,485).

==Post-NBA==
After retiring, Elliott became a basketball analyst for &quot;The NBA on NBC&quot; and, during the 2003–2004 season, for ABC Sports and ESPN. He left that position for the 2004–2005 season and became the color commentator for the Spurs&#x27; local broadcasts. On January 5, 2013, he joined Fox Sports 1, calling his first college basketball game with the network.

On March 6, 2005, his #32 was retired by the San Antonio Spurs and was hung in the rafters of the AT&amp;T Center.
His #32 is also retired by the University of Arizona.

<doc id="483308" wikidata="Q993847" url="?curid=483308" title="Connecticut Compromise">
<text>The Connecticut Compromise, also known as the Great Compromise of 1787 or Sherman Compromise, was an agreement reached during the Constitutional Convention of 1787 that in part defined the legislative structure and representation each state would have under the United States Constitution. It retained the bicameral legislature as proposed by Roger Sherman, along with proportional representation of the states in the lower house or House of Representatives, and it required the upper house or Senate to be weighted equally among the states; each state would have two members in the Senate.

==Background==

On May 29, 1787, Edmund Randolph of the Virginia delegation proposed the creation of a bicameral legislature. Under his proposal, known as the Virginia or Randolph Plan, membership in both houses would be allocated to each state proportional to its population. Candidates for the lower house would be nominated and elected by the people of each state, while candidates for the upper house would be nominated by the state legislatures and then elected by the members of the lower house.

Less populous states like Delaware were afraid that such an arrangement would result in their voices and interests being drowned out by the larger states. Many delegates also felt that the Convention did not have the authority to completely scrap the Articles of Confederation, as the Virginia Plan would have done. In response, on June 15, 1787, William Paterson of the New Jersey delegation proposed a legislature consisting of a single house. Each state was to have equal representation in this body, regardless of population. The New Jersey Plan, as it was called, would have left the Articles of Confederation in place but would have amended them to somewhat increase Congress&#x27;s powers.

At the time of the convention, the South was growing more quickly than the North, and southern states had the most extensive Western claims. South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia were small in the 1780s, but they expected growth and thus favored proportional representation. New York was one of the largest states at the time, but two of its three representatives (Alexander Hamilton being the exception) supported an equal representation per state, as part of their desire to see maximum autonomy for the states.

James Madison and Hamilton were two of the leaders of the proportional representation group. Madison argued that a conspiracy of large states against the small states was unrealistic as the large states were so different from each other. Hamilton argued that the states were artificial entities made up of individuals and accused small state representatives of wanting power, not liberty. For their part, the small state representatives argued that the states were, in fact, of a legally equal status and that proportional representation would be unfair to their states. Gunning Bedford Jr. of Delaware notoriously threatened on behalf of the small states, &quot;the small ones w[ould] find some foreign ally of more honor and good faith, who will take them by the hand and do them justice&quot;. Elbridge Gerry ridiculed the small states&#x27; claim of sovereignty, saying &quot;that we never were independent States, were not such now, &amp; never could be even on the principles of the Confederation. The States &amp; the advocates for them were intoxicated with the idea of their sovereignty.&quot;

On June 19, 1787, the delegates rejected the New Jersey Plan and voted to proceed with a discussion of the Virginia Plan. The small states became increasingly discontented, and some threatened to withdraw. On July 2, 1787, the Convention was deadlocked over giving each state an equal vote in the upper house, with five states in the affirmative, five in the negative, and one divided.

==Compromise==
The problem was referred to a committee consisting of one delegate from each state to reach a compromise. On July 5, 1787, the committee submitted its report, which became the basis for the &quot;Great Compromise&quot; of the Convention. The report recommended that in the upper house each state should have an equal vote, and in the lower house, each state should have one representative for every 40,000 inhabitants, counting three-fifths of each state&#x27;s enslaved population toward that state&#x27;s total population, and that money bills should originate in the lower house (not subject to amendment by the upper chamber).

Sherman sided with the two-house national legislature of the Virginia Plan, but proposed &quot;That the proportion of suffrage in the 1st. Branch [house] should be according to the respective numbers of free inhabitants; and that in the second branch or Senate, each State should have one vote and no more.&quot; What was ultimately included in the constitution was a modified form of this plan, partly because the larger states disliked it. In committee, Benjamin Franklin modified Sherman&#x27;s proposal to make it more acceptable to the larger states. He added the requirement that revenue bills originate in the House.

James Madison of Virginia, Rufus King of Massachusetts, and Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania each vigorously opposed the compromise since it left the Senate looking like the Confederation Congress. For the nationalists, the Convention&#x27;s vote for the compromise was a setback. However, on July 23, they found a way to continue with their vision of an elite, independent Senate. Just before most of the convention&#x27;s work was referred to the Committee of Detail, Morris and King moved that states&#x27; members in the Senate be given individual votes, rather than voting en bloc, as they had in the Confederation Congress. Then Oliver Ellsworth, a leading proponent of the Connecticut Compromise, supported their motion, and the Convention reached the enduring compromise.

After six weeks of turmoil, on July 16, 1787, North Carolina switched its vote to equal representation per state, Massachusetts&#x27; delegation was divided, and a compromise was reached on a 5–4 vote of the states. Every state was given equal representation, previously known as the New Jersey Plan, in one house of Congress, and proportional representation, known before as the Virginia Plan, in the other. Because it was considered more responsive to majority sentiment, the House of Representatives was given the power to originate all legislation dealing with the federal budget and revenues/taxation, per the Origination Clause. 

Since the Convention had earlier accepted the Virginia Plan&#x27;s proposal that senators have long terms, restoring that plan&#x27;s vision of individually powerful senators stopped the Senate from becoming a strong safeguard of federalism. State governments lost their direct say in Congress&#x27;s decisions to make national laws. As the personally influential senators received terms much longer than the state legislators who elected them, they became substantially independent. The compromise continued to serve the self-interests of small-state political leaders, who were assured of access to more seats in the Senate than they might otherwise have obtained.

==Constitution==
Senate representation was explicitly protected in Article Five of the United States Constitution:

This agreement allowed deliberations to continue and thus led to the Three-fifths Compromise, which further complicated the issue of popular representation in the House.

<text>Brian Joseph Burton (born July 29, 1977), known professionally as Danger Mouse, is an American musician and record producer. He came to prominence in 2004 when he released &quot;The Grey Album&quot;, which combined vocal performances from Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;The Black Album&quot; with instrumentals from the Beatles&#x27; &quot;The Beatles&quot;, also known as &quot;The White Album&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Esquire&quot; named him one of the &quot;75 most influential people of the 21st century&quot;.

Danger Mouse formed Gnarls Barkley with CeeLo Green in 2006 and produced its albums &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; and &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. In 2009, he collaborated with James Mercer of the indie rock band The Shins to form the band Broken Bells; the band released three albums since then, with &quot;Into the Blue&quot; (2022) being the most recent one. Burton collaborated with rapper MF Doom as Danger Doom on &quot;The Mouse and the Mask&quot; and with emcee Black Thought on &quot;Cheat Codes&quot;.

Danger Mouse produced the second Gorillaz album (2005&#x27;s &quot;Demon Days&quot;), Beck&#x27;s 2008 record &quot;Modern Guilt&quot;, and four albums with The Black Keys (&quot;Attack &amp; Release&quot;, &quot;Brothers&quot;, &quot;El Camino&quot;, and &quot;Turn Blue&quot;). In 2016, he produced, performed on, and co-wrote songs for the eleventh studio album by the Red Hot Chili Peppers titled &quot;The Getaway&quot;. He has produced and co-written albums by Norah Jones (&quot;Little Broken Hearts&quot;), Electric Guest (&quot;Mondo&quot;), Portugal. The Man (&quot;Evil Friends&quot;), Adele (&quot;25&quot;), and ASAP Rocky (&quot;At.Long.Last.ASAP&quot;). He has been nominated for 22 Grammy Awards and has won six. He has been nominated in the Producer of the Year category five times, and won the award in 2011.

==Early life and music career==
Brian Joseph Burton was born on July 29, 1977 in White Plains, New York. He grew up in Spring Valley, New York. Burton moved to Stone Mountain, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta, where he attended and graduated from Redan High School. He lived in Athens, Georgia, where he pursued a degree in telecommunications at the University of Georgia on scholarship, and where his trip hop works (&quot;The Chilling Effect&quot; (1999), &quot;Rhode Island&quot; (2000), and &quot;Pelican City / Scanner – Pelican City vs. Scanner&quot; (2002)) were released while he was a student. While at the University of Georgia he was introduced to Nirvana, Pink Floyd, and Portishead, and came to know the indie rock scene in Athens, remixed work by several local artists, including Neutral Milk Hotel, and DJ&#x27;d for University of Georgia radio station WUOG-FM. 

== Music career ==
===1998–2004===
While in Athens, Burton took second place in a 1998 talent contest and was asked to open for a concert at the University of Georgia featuring OutKast and Goodie Mob. Afterwards, Burton says he approached CeeLo Green, a member of Goodie Mob, and gave him an instrumental demo tape. He suggested and negotiated CeeLo&#x27;s appearance on the 26&#x27; Remix of the Danger Mouse and Jemini record. When Burton met CeeLo for this project, he shared some beats which led them to collaborate as Gnarls Barkley.

From 1998 to 2003, Burton created a series of remix CDs and records under the stage name Danger Mouse. He performed in a mouse outfit because he was too shy to show his face, and took his name from the English cartoon series &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;.

Burton moved to Britain for a couple of years, living in New Cross in London and working at the Rose pub near London Bridge. While there, he sent a demo to Lex Records, which signed him. Burton relocated to Los Angeles; his first original releases under the name Danger Mouse were his collaborations with rapper Jemini, including the album &quot;Ghetto Pop Life&quot;, released in 2003 on Lex Records. The Danger Mouse debut was well received by critics, but he did not rise to fame until he created &quot;The Grey Album&quot;, mixing a cappella versions of Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;The Black Album&quot; over beats crafted from samples of the Beatles&#x27; eponymous album, also known as &quot;The White Album&quot;. The remix album, originally created just for his friends, spread over the Internet and became very popular with both the general audience and critics, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; calling it the ultimate remix record and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranking it the best record of that year. He discussed his feelings about any controversy the album may have created in the documentary &quot;Alternative Freedom&quot;. Danger Mouse was named among the Men of the Year by &quot;GQ&quot; in 2004 and won a 2005 &quot;Wired&quot; Rave Award.

=== 2004–2007 ===
&quot;The Grey Album&quot; got the attention of Damon Albarn, who enlisted Danger Mouse to produce Gorillaz&#x27; second studio album, &quot;Demon Days&quot;. &quot;Demon Days&quot; earned Burton a Grammy Award nomination for Producer of the Year.

Danger Mouse&#x27;s next project was &quot;The Mouse and the Mask&quot;, a collaboration with MF Doom (as Danger Doom) about and for Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim. The two had previously collaborated on the Danger Mouse remix of Zero 7&#x27;s &quot;Somersault&quot;, on the Prince Po track &quot;Social Distortion&quot;, and on Gorillaz&#x27; &quot;November Has Come&quot;. A year later, Danger Doom released a follow-up EP called &quot;Occult Hymn&quot;. The 7-track EP features new songs, and remixes from &quot;The Mouse &amp; The Mask&quot;, and was released as a free download on Adult Swim&#x27;s site.

In 2006, Danger Mouse and CeeLo as Gnarls Barkley released their first album, &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, which includes the international hit single &quot;Crazy&quot;. &quot;Crazy&quot; became the first UK number-one single based solely on downloads. Gnarls Barkley set out on tour and was one of the main opening acts on the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; &quot;Stadium Arcadium World Tour&quot;. The Gnarls Barkley touring lineup featured future Chili Peppers guitarist, Josh Klinghoffer. He produced two tracks on The Rapture&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Pieces of the People We Love&quot;. In the autumn of 2006, Sparklehorse released his fourth album, &quot;Dreamt for Light Years in the Belly of a Mountain&quot;, a collaboration with Danger Mouse and Steven Drozd of The Flaming Lips. In August and September 2006, Danger Mouse collaborated with British graffiti artist Banksy to replace 500 copies of Paris Hilton&#x27;s album &quot;Paris&quot; in British music stores with altered album artwork and a 40-minute instrumental song containing various statements she had made.

=== 2007–present ===

In January 2007, Danger Mouse produced another collaboration with Damon Albarn on &quot;The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen&quot;, along with The Clash bassist Paul Simonon, former The Verve guitarist Simon Tong and afrobeat pioneer and Africa 70 drummer Tony Allen.

In March 2008, &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, the second album of his and CeeLo Green&#x27;s Gnarls Barkley project, was released. In May 2008, an album with Martina Topley-Bird, titled &quot;The Blue God&quot;, was released. Topley-Bird collaborated on &quot;All Alone&quot;, one song on the Danger Mouse produced Gorillaz second LP, &quot;Demon Days&quot;. Also released in May 2008 was &quot;Replica Sun Machine&quot;, an album with the band The Shortwave Set, including a collaboration with Van Dyke Parks and the Velvet Underground&#x27;s John Cale, according to British music magazine &quot;New Musical Express&quot;.

Upcoming releases include a follow-up to &quot;Ghetto Pop Life&quot; entitled &quot;Kill Your Heroes&quot;. It was scheduled to be released in summer of 2006, but its release was pushed back to an undetermined date. He was also working on an album with The Black Keys and Ike Turner. Turner&#x27;s death was expected to cancel the album, but The Black Keys and Danger Mouse released &quot;Attack &amp; Release&quot; in April 2008. Some songs must have been recorded by Turner, however, as a posthumous Danger Mouse produced album has been mentioned, and another collaboration with MF Doom.

Danger Mouse produced and crafted beat structures with Beck for Beck&#x27;s album &quot;Modern Guilt&quot;, which was released in July 2008. In April 2009, he and Helena Costas released an album as Joker&#x27;s Daughter titled &quot;The Last Laugh&quot;. Danger Mouse was listed as one of &quot;Esquire&quot;″s 75 most influential people of the 21st century.

Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse were due to release an album in the summer of 2009 entitled &quot;Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse Present: Dark Night of the Soul&quot; (together with a 100+ photo book with photographs by David Lynch). Due to a dispute with EMI the album was not released officially until July 12, 2010. However, the BBC reported that Danger Mouse planned to release a full illustrated jewel case with a blank CD-R included in it. The CD-R was to be labeled: &quot;For Legal Reasons, enclosed CD-R contains no music. Use it as you will.&quot;

On November 8, 2009, &quot;Paste&quot; magazine named Danger Mouse the &quot;Best Producer of the Decade (2000–2009).&quot;

Together with James Mercer, Danger Mouse (billed by his real name, Brian Burton) formed Broken Bells. The project was first announced on September 29, 2009. On December 21, 2009, the band informed fans in an e-mail message of the release of their debut single &quot;The High Road&quot;, which was made available as a free download on their official site. The self-titled debut album was released in the U.S. on March 9, 2010.

In 2010, Danger Mouse began producing U2&#x27;s thirteenth studio album &quot;Songs of Innocence&quot;, released in 2014. U2&#x27;s frontman, Bono, said in 2010, &quot;We have about 12 songs with him. At the moment that looks like the album we will put out next because it&#x27;s just happening so easily.&quot; Ultimately, Danger Mouse was credited as co-producer on 7 of the album&#x27;s 11 tracks, and sole producer on &quot;Sleep Like a Baby Tonight&quot; and &quot;This Is Where You Can Reach Me Now&quot;. During this period, he produced the band&#x27;s single &quot;Ordinary Love&quot;, released in 2013 as part of the soundtrack to &quot;&quot;, and their single &quot;Invisible&quot;, which was released on Super Bowl Sunday, February 2, 2014.

In 2005, Danger Mouse began composing a &quot;Spaghetti Western&quot; album with composer Daniele Luppi and main vocalists Jack White and Norah Jones. Instrumentation was done mainly by musicians who played on the original Ennio Morricone scores. Danger Mouse does not play any instruments on the album. The style of the album reflects much of Danger Mouse&#x27;s work since 2005, such as segments of Beck&#x27;s &quot;Modern Guilt&quot;, aspects of &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot;, and songs like &quot;Mongrel Heart&quot; off of the self-titled &quot;Broken Bells&quot; album. The album was titled &quot;Rome&quot; and was released on May 16, 2011.

On February 13, 2011, Danger Mouse won a Grammy for Best Producer for his work on the Black Keys&#x27; &quot;Brothers&quot;, Broken Bells&#x27; self-titled album, and the Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse album &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot;.

On November 1, 2011, Los Angeles-based indie band Electric Guest released their first single, &quot;Troubleman/American Daydream&quot;, produced by Danger Mouse. Danger Mouse produced the band&#x27;s whole debut album &quot;Mondo&quot; which was released on April 24, 2012.

On May 1, 2012, Norah Jones released her Danger Mouse-produced fifth studio album &quot;Little Broken Hearts&quot; (Blue Note/EMI).

Danger Mouse co-wrote the song &quot;Keep It for Your Own&quot; by POP ETC.

Danger Mouse produced Portugal. The Man&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Evil Friends&quot;, released in June 2013.

Danger Mouse produced &quot;At.Long.Last.ASAP&quot;, the 2015 album by rapper ASAP Rocky.
In November 2015 Danger Mouse launched his own record label, 30th Century Records.

Danger Mouse was announced as the producer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers eleventh album and that he would replace Rick Rubin, the producer of the band&#x27;s previous six albums dating back to 1991. Production began in February 2015. The production was halted due to an injury the band&#x27;s bassist Flea suffered during a skiing trip. It resumed in August 2015 and continued into early 2016. &quot;The Getaway&quot; was released in June 2016 with Danger Mouse performing on and having co-writing credits on many of the songs.

In March 2017, Red Hot Chili Peppers singer Anthony Kiedis indicated that the band would likely want to work again with Danger Mouse on the follow-up to &quot;The Getaway&quot;. Kiedis stated &quot;I think it&#x27;s good to work with the same guy again to um, you know you had your freshman experience. I think we owe it to ourselves to start from the beginning with this guy and see what we can accomplish.&quot; However, their follow-up albums, 2022&#x27;s &quot;Unlimited Love&quot; and &quot;Return of the Dream Canteen&quot;, featured the return of longtime producer Rick Rubin.

In April 2017, he released &quot;Resistance Radio: The Man in The High Castle&quot;, a compilation produced alongside 30th Century Records-signee producer Sam Cohen. Connected to Amazon&#x27;s eponymous TV series, this album contains covers of 1960s classics by contemporary artists like Beck, Norah Jones, Kelis, Andrew VanWyngarden, The Shins, and more.
In June 2017, Portugal. The Man released &quot;Woodstock&quot;, their follow-up to 2013&#x27;s &quot;Evil Friends&quot;; both of which featured production from Danger Mouse.

In June 2017, he collaborated with Run the Jewels and Big Boi to create the song &quot;Chase Me&quot; for the 2017 film &quot;Baby Driver&quot;.

In May 2018, he produced the acclaimed album &quot;Wide Awake!&quot; by Parquet Courts and in 2019 he collaborated with Karen O to create the album &quot;Lux Prima&quot;. The album has been met with generally favorable review by critics.

On August 12, 2022, he released a collaborative studio album &quot;Cheat Codes&quot; with The Roots emcee Black Thought. The same year, he released a third Broken Bells album with James Mercer entitled &quot;Into the Blue&quot;.

== Philosophy ==
In an interview for &quot;The New York Times&quot; magazine, Danger Mouse was compared to a film auteur, basing his music production philosophy on the cinematic philosophy of directors like Woody Allen. &quot;Woody Allen was an auteur: he did his thing, and that particular thing was completely his own&quot;, he said. &quot;That&#x27;s what I decided to do with music. I want to create a director&#x27;s role within music, which is what I tried to do on this album (&quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;)... I can create different kinds of musical worlds, but the artist needs the desire to go into that world... Musically, there is no one who has the career I want. That&#x27;s why I have to use film directors as a model.&quot;

<text>Ohio University (Ohio or OU) is a public research university with its main campus in Athens, Ohio, United States. The university was first conceived in the 1787 contract between the Board of Treasury of the United States and the Ohio Company of Associates, which set aside the College Lands to support a university, and subsequently approved by the territorial legislature in 1802 and the Ohio General Assembly in 1804. The university opened for students in 1809, and was the first university to be established in the former Northwest Territory.

Ohio University comprises nine campuses, nine undergraduate colleges, a graduate college, a college of medicine, and a public affairs school. It offers more than 250 areas of undergraduate study as well as certificates, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees. It is a member of the University System of Ohio. The university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. As of fall 2020, the university&#x27;s total enrollment at Athens was slightly more than 18,000, while the all-campus enrollment was just over 30,000.

Ohio&#x27;s intercollegiate athletic teams are known as the Bobcats and compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division I level as charter members of the Mid-American Conference. Ohio football has participated in 16 bowl games through the 2023 season. The men&#x27;s basketball team has made 14 appearances in the NCAA Division I basketball tournament, with their most recent appearance in 2021.

==History==
===Charter and establishment===
A university in the Ohio Country was first envisioned by Manasseh Cutler, credited as the school&#x27;s founder along with Revolutionary War Brigadier General Rufus Putnam. In addition to being instrumental in its founding, Putnam was also an original trustee of the university. Putnam Hall there is named for him. Cutler had served as a chaplain in George Washington&#x27;s Continental Army. The institution&#x27;s first name was American Western University. In 1797, settlers from Marietta traveled downstream on the Ohio River and up the Hocking River to establish a location for the school in what the Congress designated as the College Lands, founding Athens due to its location directly between the original capital of Chillicothe and Marietta. In 1802, approval was granted by the territorial government for the establishment of the American Western University, but the school was not operated under that name. Ohio University was recognized by the new state on February 18, 1804, with its charter being certified by the Ohio General Assembly. This last approval happened eleven months after Ohio was admitted to the Union. The first three students enrolled in 1809. The first two bachelor&#x27;s degrees were granted in 1815.

===19th century to present===
Ohio University was closed between 1843 and 1848. Women were first admitted to the university in 1868. In 1874, the Ohio General Assembly created the new Ohio State University in Columbus as a land grant school upon passage of the Morrill Act of 1862. At that time some representatives proposed that both Ohio University and Miami University be demoted to preparatory schools. In 1880, it was instead suggested that Ohio and Miami be merged directly with Ohio State, but the 1896 Sleeper Bill, introduced by Athenian David L. Sleeper, the speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives, provided annual support for the university; this set the precedent for continuing state support of Ohio University. A second challenge was defeated in 1906. The 20th century saw dramatic growth in student enrollment, academic offerings, and research facilities. Between 1955 and 1970, undergraduate enrollment tripled from 7,000 to 20,000. During this era, the campus grew, with the construction of 25 new dormitories located on two new residential college greens, with radio and television stations, research and classroom facilities, and the construction of the 13,000-seat Convocation Center arena. Ohio University ranks among the top 25 largest residential college campuses in the United States, and the 5th largest in total campus size after acquiring acreage from adjacent hilltop properties in the 1990s.

Ohio restructured its two colleges into five in 1935, establishing the colleges of Commerce, Fine Arts, and Applied Science in addition to the existing colleges of Arts &amp; Sciences and Education. The graduate college was created in 1936, and the first PhD program was initiated in 1956 in chemistry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulleted/Pictorial History&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Starting mid–century, the university also began to establish regional campuses throughout southeast Ohio. The first, Ohio University – Chillicothe, was opened in 1946 to help eliminate post-World War II overcrowding on the university&#x27;s main campus. The school began with 281 students, 70 percent of which were armed services veterans. Later campuses would come in 1946 at Zanesville, 1956 in Ironton and Lancaster, 1957 in St. Clairsville, and formerly Proctorville in 2006.

In 1964, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson publicly referenced his Great Society initiative for the first time on the College Green, giving the university exposure across America and internationally. On May 4, 1970, the Ohio National Guard was ordered to open fire on students demonstrating against the Vietnam War at Kent State University, killing 4 and wounding 9. At the same time, there were sit-ins and anti-war riots at Ohio University, even more intense than those of Kent State. This was partly due to the administration&#x27;s refusal to close the university; instead of going home, many students from other Ohio universities that did close came to Athens to protest further. When the Ohio National Guard was called in to Athens, there was a 3-hour battle at the Baker Center, resulting in 23 injured and 54 arrested students. On May 15, the campus was closed. Alden Library was completed in 1969. In 1975, Ohio established its medical school, known as the Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine. Heritage is the only medical school in the state to award the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree. In 1979, on the university&#x27;s 175th anniversary, Chubu University of Japan donated 175 cherry trees. The Ohio University Innovation Center, a technology business incubator, started in 1983. The Ohio University Edison Biotechnology Institute was founded in 1984. In the Glidden administration, from 1994 to 2004, new construction included the Life Sciences Research Facility, Emeriti Park, Walter Hall, plus major renovations to Gordy Hall, Grover Center, and Memorial Auditorium; the expansion of Bentley Hall and Copeland Hall; and groundwork for the new Baker Center that opened in 2007. In the Fall of 2012, Ohio University converted its academic calendar from quarters to semesters, after first having changed to quarters in 1967.

==Campuses==

===Athens campus===
The main residential university campus is in Athens, Ohio, overlooking the Hocking River. Constructed under the Jefferson presidency, New England and Early Americana Federalist themes are prevalent in the university&#x27;s earliest architecture. Development of the campus began in 1812 with the erection of the university&#x27;s central building, Manasseh Cutler Hall, a registered national landmark, and built only 20 years after the White House. Cutler Hall&#x27;s University Chimes, replacing an existing old cast iron bell, chime on the half hour every day until 9:00pm. The original bell, the 3rd oldest university bell in America, which is still hung in the Cutler Hall Cupola, rang to signal the start and end of the school day, as well as to signal the end of different class periods. Cast in the early 1800s, it served the university for well over a century.

====College Green====

The historic College Green is the centralized quadrangle lawn and location of significant campus buildings: Manasseh Cutler Hall, the Office of the President; Wilson Hall, the College of Arts &amp; Sciences; McGuffey Hall, named for William McGuffey; and the College Gateway. These three original primary structures are featured elements of the official current university logo and maintain true to their original design of over 200 years ago. The College Green has changed little in the past two centuries, which contributes to the university&#x27;s colonial appearance. The green, inspired by the university founders, is based upon the classic layout of traditional English and New England towns and similar to university quadrangles. College Green features Galbreath Chapel, the spire of which, topped with a brass weather vane, is modeled after that of the portico of Nash&#x27;s All Souls Church in London. Other buildings on the College Green include Chubb Hall, home to Undergraduate Admissions as well as the Offices of the Bursar and Registrar; Ellis Hall, home to the departments of English, Classics, Religious Studies, and Philosophy; Templeton-Blackburn Memorial Auditorium; as well as Bryan Hall, an upperclassman residence hall. The University Sundial, located behind Galbreath Chapel, was constructed in 1907 and marks the original location of the university&#x27;s first building. College Green is framed by two main university gateways. Alumni Gateway, built in 1915, features the text &quot;That thou Mayest Grow In Knowledge, Wisdom and Love,&quot; borrowed from the Latin phrase inscribed over a gateway to the University of Padua and was dedicated upon the 100th anniversary of the university&#x27;s first graduating class. The newer College Gate, built in the 1960s, features words taken from the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 regarding public education. Traditions surrounding College Green include the latter half of first year convocation, where students, led by the Ohio University Marching 110, march up Richland Avenue, onto Presidents Street, turning north onto Court Street, and entering the Green through the College Gate at the corner of Court and Union Streets. From there, a large involvement fair is held where students find clubs they wish to join.

====John Calhoun Baker University Center====

The John Calhoun Baker University Center, which opened in January 2007, is named after the 14th president of the university. The facility replaced the original Baker Center located on East Union Street across from College Green and serves as the hub of campus activity. Electronic maps and virtual university e-tours, available at center information desks and online, direct visitors across campus. The building features Georgian-influenced Federal architecture and large windows that admit natural light and afford expansive views of the southern and western sides of the campus. In contrast to the exterior&#x27;s red brick and white columns, the interior has a more contemporary style with high domed ceilings. Terrazzo mosaics of aspects of the earth&#x27;s globe are embedded in the atrium of the main entrance to the building. Baker Center contains a large food court called West 82; a pub bistro called Latitude 39; a Grand Ballroom; The Honors Collegium, The Wall of Presidents, the Bobcat Student Lounge, a shop called Bobcat Depot that sells apparel, computers, and accessories; a theater seating 400; study areas; computer labs; administrative offices; and numerous conference rooms. The Front Room, a large coffee house named after a former popular university rathskeller, features a stage, artwork and a community fireplace. It serves Starbucks products and university bakery items and is housed on the fourth floor, which opens onto its own outside terrace as well as onto the intersection of Park Place and Court Streets, making it a popular spot for students between classes. Other amenities include a United States Post Office and the Trisolini Art Gallery, named after a prominent fine arts faculty member.

====East Green====
There are twelve residence halls on East Green.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Tōyō has decreased rapidly since the 1960s.

== History ==
As with all of Kōchi Prefecture, the area of Tōyō was part of ancient Tosa Province. The name of Aki District appears in Nara period . During the Edo period, the area was part of the holdings of Tosa Domain ruled by the Yamauchi clan from their seat at Kōchi Castle. The villages of Kannoura (甲浦村) and None (野根村) were established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on October 1, 1889. Kannoura was raised to town status on April 1, 1916, followed by None on February 11, 1938. The two towns merged on July 1, 1959 to form the town of Tōyō.

In 2007, Yasuoki Tashima, the former mayor of the town, brought national and worldwide attention when he applied to host Japan&#x27;s high level nuclear waste repository in Tōyō without the knowledge or approval of the town assembly. The plan was met with resistance from the town council, the governors of both and Kōchi and Tokushima Prefecture, as well as outrage by local residents. He lost a subsequent election and resigned.

==Government==
Tōyō has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of nine members. Tōyō, together with the city of Muroto, contributes one member to the Kōchi Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Kōchi 1st district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
In addition to the commercial fishery industry, Tōyō&#x27;s economy is centered on forestry and fruit tree cultivation. In the past, bonito fishing and whaling were important, but now the main fishing industry is coastal fishing. The upper reaches of the None River are rainy areas and are noted for wood production.

==Education==
Tōyō has two public elementary schools and two public middle schools operated by the town government. The town does not have a high school.

==Transportation==
===Railway===
The Asa Kaigan Railway&#x27;s Asatō Line passed through the town, but its terminus, Kannoura Station closed in 2020 when the line was converted from rail to Dual-mode vehicle operations.

<text>The Welsh Tract, also called the Welsh Barony, was a portion of the Province of Pennsylvania, a British colony in North America (today a U.S. state), settled largely by Welsh-speaking Quakers in the late 17th century. The region is located to the west of Philadelphia. The original settlers, led by John Roberts, negotiated with William Penn in 1684 to constitute the Tract as a separate county whose local government would use the Welsh language. The Barony was never formally created, but the many Welsh settlers gave their communities Welsh names that survive today. A more successful attempt at setting up a Gwladfa (Welsh-speaking colony) occurred two centuries later, in the Chubut Province of Patagonia, Argentina.

==History==

In the late 17th century, there was significant Welsh immigration to Pennsylvania for religious and cultural reasons. In about 1681, a group of Welsh Quakers met with William Penn to secure a land grant to conduct their affairs in their language. The parties agreed on a tract covering 40,000 acres (160 km2), to be constituted as a separate county whose people and government could conduct their affairs in Welsh.

Whereas divers considerable persons among Þe Welsh Friends have requested me Þt all Þe Lands Purchased of me by those of North Wales and South Wales, together with Þe adjacent counties to Þm, as Haverfordshire, Shropshire and Cheshire, about 40,000 acres, may be layd out contiguously as one Barony, alledging Þt Þe number come and suddenly to come, are such as will be capable of planting Þe same much wth in Þe proportion allowed by Þe custom of Þe country, &amp; so not lye in large useless vacancies. And because I am inclined and determined to agree and favor Þm wth any reasonable Conveniency and privilede: I do hereby charge thee and strictly require thee to lay out Þe sd tract of Land in as uniform a manner as conveniently may be, upon Þe west side of Skoolkill river, running three miles upon Þe same, &amp; two miles backward, &amp; then extend Þe parallel wth Þe river six miles and to run westwardly so far as this Þe sd quantity of land be Compleatly surveyed unto you.—Given at Pennsbury, Þe 13th Ist mo. [March] 1684.

The Welsh Tract&#x27;s boundaries were established in 1687, but notwithstanding the prior agreement, by the 1690s the land had already been partitioned among different counties, despite appeals from the Welsh settlers, and the Tract never gained self-government.

The Roberts and other Welsh families became influential in the area, through the building of mills and the eventual introduction of the railroad. It is the railroad that gives the best-known part of the area its current name, the Philadelphia Main Line, named after the mainline of the Pennsylvania Railroad, portions of which were absorbed into Conrail in 1976 (with Amtrak operating intercity passenger rail service from 1971, SEPTA operating commuter rail service from 1983, and Norfolk Southern acquiring Conrail&#x27;s freight operations in 1997) as one of the principal rail lines running between Chicago, IL and the Eastern seaboard. After the American Civil War, 104 Welsh families from this region migrated to Knoxville, Tennessee, establishing a strong Welsh presence there.

As suburbanization spread westward from Philadelphia in the late 19th century (thanks to the railroads), living in a community with a Welsh name acquired a cachet. Some communities in the area formerly comprising the Welsh Tract were subsequently given Welsh or Welsh-sounding names to improve their perceived desirability. Among these were Gladwyne, formerly &quot;Merion Square&quot; (which was given its new name in 1891, although the name is meaningless in Welsh), Bryn Mawr, formerly &quot;Humphreysville&quot; (which was renamed in 1869), and Llanerch called so as early as 1867 meaning “Open Space” in Welsh.

==Today==
The area is now part of Montgomery, Chester, and Delaware counties. Many towns in the area still bear Welsh names. Some, such as North Wales, Lower Gwynedd, Upper Gwynedd, Lower Merion, Upper Merion, Narberth,
Bala Cynwyd, Radnor, Berwyn, and Haverford Township, are named after places in Wales. Others, such as Tredyffrin and Uwchlan have independent Welsh names.

A second &quot;Welsh Tract&quot; of was granted to Welsh emigrants by William Penn in 1701. It made up the modern Pencader Hundred, Delaware, and some of Cecil County, Maryland.

<text>Leon Julian Davis (November 21, 1905 – September 14, 1992) was a Russian-born American labor leader who co-founded 1199: The National Health Care Workers&#x27; Union, as well as 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East.

==Background==
Davis was born in Pinsk, Russian Empire, on November 21, 1906. At the age of 15 he settled with his Russian-speaking family in Hartford, Connecticut, where he attended public schools and learned English. In 1927 his family moved to New York City. After two years at Columbia University&#x27;s pharmacy school, he left to become a drug store clerk.

==Career: Local 1199 union==

In 1932 he founded Local 1199 of the Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union, which he ran for a half century. Local 1199 was a leader in walkouts in New York (1959, 1962) and Charleston, South Carolina (1969). He fought for collective bargaining, higher wages, better work conditions, and higher living standards. Union members included: clerks, janitors, aides, orderlies, laundry workers, porters, dishwashers, elevator operators, and other employees in hospitals, nursing homes and pharmacies. Local 1199 peaked at some 150,000 members in the late 1970s. It was early among unions to establish education and training for members, healthcare and housing for members&#x27; families, and scholarships and camps for members&#x27; children.

Leon J. Davis was instrumental to securing funding for the 1199 Plaza, a massive 1199 Union housing project.

During the Vietnam War, Local 1199 took an early anti-war position. It also supported the civil rights movement.

==Communist accusations==

In 1948, Davis appeared before a Congressional committee and denied membership in the Communist Party. However, he did testify that Communists and labor in general shared many social objectives with him.

==Personal life and death==

Davis married Julia Gaberman, a social worker; they had two daughters.

He loved art, music, and theater, read literature in three languages, gardened at his home in Flushing, Queens, New York.

He died of heart failure on September 14, 1992, at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York.

==Legacy==

Martin Luther King Jr. referred to Davis&#x27;s organization as &quot;my favorite union&quot;.

A Manhattan city block on West 43rd Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, near the Local 1199 headquarters at 310 West 43rd Street, was named in his honor.

Two books about the union, &quot;Upheaval in the Quiet Zone&quot; and &quot;Not for Bread Alone&quot; examine the deep, almost patriarchal connection between Davis and Local 1199.

<text>was a town located in Kami District, Kōchi Prefecture, Japan.

== History ==
On March 1, 2006, Yasu, along with the towns of Akaoka, Kagami and Noichi, and the village of Yoshikawa (all from Kami District), was merged to create the city of Kōnan and no longer exists as an independent municipality.

The port, Tei, is located in the south-east of the town and dates from the Edo period, over 200 years ago. The port walls of the time have remained intact.

The town merger, originally planned for 2005, was postponed because of the withdrawal of participating towns. Yasu did not withdraw but residents were not overly favorable to the merger. The merger into the new city of Konan took effect on March 1, 2006.

== Population ==
As of June 2004, the town had an estimated population of 4,440 and a density of 108.32 persons per km2. The total area was 39.07 km2.

== Economy ==
The main industries of Yasu are fisheries and farming. Local products include melons and various fruits.

== Education ==
As of July 2004, Yasu Junior High School has an enrollment of 97 students between the ages of 12 and 15. As Yasu has no high school, graduating students will continue to high schools in the Kami Area, Aki (to the east) and Kōnan (to the west).

<doc id="483355" wikidata="Q3366633" url="?curid=483355" title="Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba">
<text>The Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba () is a centre-right political party in Manitoba, Canada. It is currently the opposition party in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba, following a defeat in the 2023 provincial election.

==History==

=== Origins and early years ===
The origins of the party lie at the end of the 19th century. Party politics were weak in Manitoba for several years after it entered Canadian confederation in 1870. The system of government was essentially one of non-partisan democracy, though some leading figures such as Marc-Amable Girard were identified with the Conservatives at the federal level. 

Public representation was mostly a matter of communal loyalties—ethnic, religious, and linguistic—and party affiliation was at best a secondary concern.

In the 1870s, Thomas Scott (Orangeman) (not to be confused with a different Thomas Scott), was executed by Louis Riel&#x27;s provisional government . Joseph Royal attempted to introduce partisan politics into the province. Both were Conservatives, and both believed that they could lead a provincial Conservative Party. Their plans were thwarted by Premier John Norquay, who also supported the Conservatives at the federal level but included both Liberals and Conservatives in his governing alliance.

Norquay himself formed a reluctant alliance with the provincial Conservatives in 1882, in the face of strong opposition from Thomas Greenway&#x27;s Provincial Rights Party. His government was for all intents and purposes Conservative for the remainder of its time in office, though Norquay continued to describe it as &quot;non-partisan&quot;. Starting in the election of 1883, moreover, political parties began to be listed on the provincial election ballot.

=== Subsequent development of the party (1887–1898) ===
When Norquay resigned as Premier in 1887, his successor David H. Harrison also became leader of the Conservative parliamentary caucus. Norquay was able to reclaim the latter position early in 1888, following an extremely divided meeting of senior Conservative politicians. By this time, the new Liberal Premier Thomas Greenway had formally introduced party government to the province, and no one doubted that Norquay was now the province&#x27;s Conservative leader.

The Conservative Party was not yet a legally-recognized institution in the province, however, and began to lose its coherence again after Norquay&#x27;s death in 1889. Conservative MLAs simply referred to themselves as &quot;the opposition&quot; for most of the decade that followed. Rodmond Roblin was the dominant Conservative MLA between 1890 and 1892, but he does not seem to have been recognized as an official leader.

After Roblin&#x27;s defeat in the election of 1892, William Alexander Macdonald became the leader of the opposition. In 1893, his election for Brandon City was declared invalid, and he lost the subsequent by-election. Remarkably, the election of Macdonald&#x27;s successor, John Andrew Davidson, was also voided in 1894. For the remainder of this parliament, James Fisher seems to have been the leading figure in the opposition ranks. It is not clear if he was formally recognized as &quot;leader of the opposition&quot;, or even as an official member of the Conservative Party.

Rodmond Roblin was re-elected in 1896, and officially became opposition leader in the legislature. The next year, Hugh John Macdonald (son of former prime minister John A. Macdonald) became the party&#x27;s official leader, while Roblin continued to lead the opposition in parliament.

=== Power and loss (1899–1939) ===

==== Taking power (1899–1915) ====
The Conservative Party became an official entity in 1899, and drew up its first election platform in the same year. It promised a board of education for the province, the creation of agricultural and technical colleges, and government ownership of railways.

Hugh John Macdonald became Premier following the 1899 election, but resigned shortly thereafter to re-enter federal politics. Rodmond Roblin succeeded Macdonald, and ruled the province for 15 years. Roblin&#x27;s government was progressively oriented, negotiated the extension of the railway, bought Manitoba&#x27;s Bell telephone operations in order to establish a government-run system, introduced corporate taxation, and created a public utilities commission while running a budgetary surplus. It was less progressive on social issues, however, and is most frequently remembered today for its opposition to women&#x27;s suffrage.

==== In the political wilderness (1915–1930s) ====
The Conservatives were brought down in 1915 by a scandal involving the construction of the province&#x27;s new legislative buildings. Roblin was forced to resign as Premier, and James Aikins led the party to a disastrous loss later in the year.

The Manitoba Conservatives received their greatest support from the francophone community in the 1915 election, because the party was seen as more supportive than the Liberals of francophone education rights. This was a pronounced contrast to the situation in federal politics, where most francophone Canadians opposed the war policies of Prime Minister Robert Borden.

Aime Benard was chosen as leader &quot;pro tem&quot; of the party on August 15, 1915, and Albert Prefontaine was chosen as the official parliamentary leader shortly thereafter. The party was a minor force in parliament, however, and was largely sidelined by the radical farmer and labour movements of the late 1910s.

On November 6, 1919, the Conservative Party chose farmer R.G. Willis to lead the party into its next electoral campaign. Willis&#x27; selection was a response to the provincial victory of the United Farmers of Ontario the previous month; he defeated Major Fawcett Taylor after three other candidates (including Prefontaine) withdrew their names. The vote total was not announced.

Willis was defeated in the election of 1920, and the Conservatives became the fourth-largest group in parliament with only six seats. John Thomas Haig subsequently became their parliamentary leader, and Fawcett Taylor was chosen as the official party leader in early 1922.

The Conservatives gradually regained support in the following 20 years, but were unable to defeat the Progressive government of John Bracken. In 1932, Bracken&#x27;s Progressives formed an alliance with the Manitoba Liberal Party to ensure that Taylor would not become the province&#x27;s Premier.

Taylor resigned as party leader in 1933, and W. Sanford Evans served as parliamentary leader for the next three years. In 1936, Errick Willis (son of R.G.) was acclaimed as party leader. He led the party in another unsuccessful challenge to the Bracken ministry in 1936.

=== 1940s–1975 ===

==== In coalition (1940–1950) ====
In 1940, Willis agreed to join Bracken in a wartime coalition government. Willis himself was given a prominent cabinet position in the all-party ministry which followed.

Three anti-coalition Conservatives were elected to the legislature in 1941. One of these, Huntly Ketchen, served as leader of the opposition. This group did not constitute a rival to the official Conservative Party, however.

In 1946, the party changed its name to the &quot;Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba&quot; to reflect the change in name of the federal Progressive Conservatives. Relations between the PCs and Liberal-Progressives deteriorated after Douglas Campbell became Premier in 1948, and the PCs voted 215–7 to leave the coalition in 1950.

==== Varying fortunes (1953–1975) ====
The 1953 election was won by the Liberals, and Willis was compelled to accept a leadership challenge the following year. Duff Roblin, grandson of Rodmond Roblin, became party leader on the second ballot and rebuilt the party&#x27;s organization which had been weakened during the coalition period.

In 1958, Roblin&#x27;s PCs ran and were elected to a minority government on a progressive platform of increased education grants, crop insurance, extension of hydro to the north, and road construction. Remarkably, his platform was well to the left of that of Campbell&#x27;s Liberal-Progressives. In 1959, Roblin returned to the polls and won a majority, which pursued a policy of &#x27;social investment&#x27;, active government and social reform (including reintroducing French to schools and expanding welfare services). In 1967, Roblin left provincial politics and was replaced by Walter Weir, a member of the party&#x27;s rural conservative wing. Weir led a somewhat more cautious and restrained government, and was defeated by the New Democratic Party under Edward Schreyer in 1969. Sidney Spivak, a Red Tory like Roblin, led the party from 1971 to 1975, but was unable to defeat Schreyer&#x27;s government.

=== Sterling Lyon leadership (1975–1981) ===
Sterling Lyon became leader of the party in 1975 and took it in a more economically liberal direction, anticipating the neoliberal economics of Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, and Mike Harris. The Lyon PCs defeated the NDP in 1977. The Lyon government was to the right of previous PC administrations and implemented a program of spending cuts and reduced taxes (while also promoting mega-projects in the energy sector). Manitobans were unreceptive to the government&#x27;s economically liberalism, and turned it out of office in 1981 after only one term, bringing the NDP back to power after.

=== Gary Filmon leadership (1983–1999) ===
Gary Filmon became leader of the Progressive Conservatives in 1983, and formed a minority government in 1988 after defeating the NDP. Filmon&#x27;s PCs remained in power for three terms, winning a majority government in 1990 and again in 1995.

Filmon&#x27;s government avoided excessive conservative rhetoric, but nonetheless reduced corporate taxes, mandated balanced budgets, and limited the power of teacher&#x27;s and nurse&#x27;s unions. It supported the Charlottetown Accord (a proposal for amending the Canadian constitution), as well as free trade with the United States. The party&#x27;s financial austerity program resulted in a balanced budget in 1995, the first in 20 years.

The PCs were hurt in the late 1990s by increased unemployment, a vote-manipulation scandal from the 1995 election (see Independent Native Voice), and the decline of the Manitoba Liberal Party. The latter development allowed the anti-Tory vote to coalesce around the NDP. Ahead of the 1999 election, Filmon announced that his government would undertake a shift further to the right if reelected. The voters were not receptive to this, and ousted the PCs in favour of the NDP.

=== Post-Filmon (2000s) ===
Filmon resigned as leader in 2000, and was replaced by Stuart Murray. The party fell to twenty seats in the election of 2003, its worst showing since 1953.

On November 5, 2005, at a meeting regarding a possible leadership convention in the near future, Murray received only 45% support from party members. On November 14, Murray stepped down as leader of the party. Hugh McFadyen became leader of the party at the leadership convention on April 29, 2006, garnering two thirds of the first ballot vote.

In McFadyen&#x27;s first campaign as party leader during the 2007 provincial election, popular support for PC Party rose 2% over 2003 numbers. Although he managed to capture a greater percentage of the provincial vote, the PCs lost one seat.

=== Pallister–Stefanson leadership (2012–2024) ===
After failing to make major gains in the 2011 provincial election, Hugh McFadyen agreed to step down as leader. On July 30, 2012, former federal MP and Filmon cabinet minister Brian Pallister was acclaimed as leader.

By the time the writs were dropped for the 2016 provincial election, the Manitoba PCs had been leading in opinion polls for almost four years, and were heavily favoured to win. As expected, Pallister led the party to a decisive victory. The PCs won 40 out of 57 seats, the largest majority government in the province&#x27;s history.

Pallister was re-elected to a majority government in 2019.

Pallister announced his resignation on August 10, 2021, and confirmed on August 29, 2021 his departure would take place on September 1, 2021. His interim successor as party leader was confirmed as Kelvin Goertzen on 31 August, 2021. An elected successor as party leader will be determined in a leadership election on October 30.

Goertzen was sworn in as premier of Manitoba, on September 1, 2021. He would serve for only two months, until November 2, and resigned shortly before PC leader Heather Stefanson was appointed and sworn in as his successor as premier later that day.

Stefanson’s succession to the premiership would mark the first female premier in Manitoba history.

The PC government was defeated in the 2023 Manitoba general election. The PCs became the official opposition for the 43rd Manitoba Legislature.

<doc id="483360" wikidata="Q484523" url="?curid=483360" title="Jared Leto">
<text>Jared Joseph Leto ( ; born December 26, 1971) is an American actor and musician. Known for his method acting in a variety of roles, he has received numerous accolades over a career spanning three decades, including an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award. Additionally, he is recognized for his musicianship and eccentric stage persona as frontman of the rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars.

After starting his career on the television series &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; (1994), Leto made his film debut in &quot;How to Make an American Quilt&quot; (1995) and gained critical attention for his performance in &quot;Prefontaine&quot; (1997). After supporting roles in &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; (1998), &quot;Fight Club&quot; (1999), &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; (1999) and &quot;American Psycho&quot; (2000), he received praise for his lead role as a drug addict in &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; (2000). He then began to focus more on music, but returned to acting with &quot;Panic Room&quot; (2002), &quot;Alexander&quot; (2004), &quot;Lord of War&quot; (2005), &quot;Chapter 27&quot; (2007), and &quot;Mr. Nobody&quot; (2009). His performance as a trans woman in &quot;Dallas Buyers Club&quot; (2013) earned him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He has since starred in &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (2016), &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; (2017), &quot;The Little Things&quot; (2021), and &quot;House of Gucci&quot; (2021), the latter two of which earned him nominations for a Golden Globe Award.

Leto is the lead vocalist, multi-instrumentalist and main songwriter for Thirty Seconds to Mars, a band he formed in 1998 with his older brother Shannon Leto. Its debut album, &quot;30 Seconds to Mars&quot; (2002), was released to positive reviews but to limited commercial success. Its second album, &quot;A Beautiful Lie&quot; (2005), pushed the band into the public eye, and the next releases, &quot;This Is War&quot; (2009) and &quot;Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams&quot; (2013), received further critical and commercial success. They were followed by &quot;America&quot; (2018) and &quot;It&#x27;s the End of the World but It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day&quot; (2023), both of which polarized critics upon release. The band has sold over 15 million albums worldwide.

== Early life ==

Leto was born on December 26, 1971, in Bossier City, Louisiana, to Constance Leto (née Metrejon). His mother has Cajun ancestry. Leto is his stepfather&#x27;s surname. His parents divorced when he was a child, and he and his older brother, Shannon, lived with their mother and their maternal grandparents, Ruby (Russell) and William Lee Metrejon. After he remarried, his father died by suicide when Jared was eight. Leto moved frequently with his family from Louisiana to different cities around the country. &quot;My mom&#x27;s father was in the Air Force,&quot; Leto has explained, &quot;so moving around a lot was a normal way of life.&quot; Leto has two younger half-brothers from his father&#x27;s second marriage.

Constance joined the hippie movement and encouraged her sons to get involved in the arts. Leto said he &quot;was raised around a lot of artists, musicians, photographers, painters and people that were in theater,&quot; adding that &quot;Just having the art communal hippie experience as a child, there wasn&#x27;t a clear line that was drawn. We celebrated creative experience and creative expression. We didn&#x27;t try and curtail it and stunt any of that kind of growth.&quot; Leto started playing music with his brother at an early age; his first musical instrument was a broken-down piano.

After dropping out briefly in the 10th grade, Leto decided to return and focus on his education at the private Emerson Preparatory School in Washington, D.C. He was interested in large-scale visual art and enrolled at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia. After developing an interest in filmmaking, he transferred to the School of Visual Arts in New York City. While he was a student there, he wrote and starred in his own short film, &quot;Crying Joy&quot;. He also attended the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design, now a part of George Washington University.

== Career ==
=== 1992–1999: Early acting roles, &quot;Prefontaine&quot; and Thirty Seconds to Mars ===

In 1992, Leto moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in directing, intending to take acting roles on the side. He found minor roles on television shows but his first break came in 1994 when he was cast opposite Claire Danes as Jordan Catalano, her love interest, in the short-lived but well-reviewed ABC teen drama &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;. The show was praised for its portrayal of adolescence and, despite its cancellation after one season, gained a strong cult following. The same year, Leto made his television film debut starring alongside Alicia Silverstone in &quot;Cool and the Crazy&quot;, and landed his first film role in the 1995 drama &quot;How to Make an American Quilt&quot;. He later co-starred with Christina Ricci in &quot;The Last of the High Kings&quot; (1996) and got a supporting role in &quot;Switchback&quot; (1997).

In 1997, Leto starred in the biopic &quot;Prefontaine&quot; as Olympic hopeful Steve Prefontaine. To prepare for the role, Leto immersed himself in the runner&#x27;s life, training for six weeks and meeting with members of his family and friends. He bore a striking resemblance to the real Prefontaine, also adopting the athlete&#x27;s voice and upright running style. His portrayal received positive reviews from critics and is often considered his breakthrough role. Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; noted: &quot;With hypnotic blue eyes and dirty blond hair, Leto captures the rock-star style Prefontaine affected, and he looks natural in fiery performances on the track, as well as off, where Pre affected a brash, confrontational style.&quot;

After landing the lead role of a British aristocrat in the 1998 drama &quot;Basil&quot;, Leto starred in the horror &quot;Urban Legend&quot;. It was poorly received by most critics, but was a financial success. That year, Terrence Malick cast Leto for a supporting role in the war film &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; alongside Sean Penn and Adrien Brody. It garnered mostly positive reviews and was a moderate success. It received multiple awards and nominations, including seven Academy Award nominations; Leto shared a Satellite Award with the rest of the cast.

Leto formed the rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars in 1998 in Los Angeles, California with his brother Shannon. When the group first started, Jared Leto did not allow his position of Hollywood actor to be used in promotion of the band. Their debut album had been in the works for a couple of years, with Leto writing the majority of the songs. Their work led to a number of record labels being interested in signing Thirty Seconds to Mars, which eventually signed to Immortal Records.

In 1999, Leto played a gay high school teacher who attracts the attention of Robert Downey, Jr.&#x27;s character in &quot;Black and White&quot;, and had a supporting role in the drama &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot;, an adaptation of the memoir of the same name by Susanna Kaysen. He then portrayed Angel Face in &quot;Fight Club&quot; (1999), a film adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk&#x27;s novel of the same name, directed by David Fincher.

=== 2000–2005: &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;, other roles, &quot;Panic Room&quot; and &quot;A Beautiful Lie&quot; ===
Leto played Paul Allen, a rival of Patrick Bateman, in the psychological thriller &quot;American Psycho&quot; (2000). Though the film polarized audiences and critics, Leto&#x27;s performance was well received. The same year, he starred as heroin addict Harry Goldfarb in &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;, an adaptation of Hubert Selby, Jr.&#x27;s novel of the same name, directed by Darren Aronofsky and co-starring Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans. To prepare for his role, Leto lived on the streets of New York City and refrained from having sex for two months prior to shooting. He starved himself for months, losing 28 pounds to realistically play his heroin addict character. After the shooting of the film, Leto moved to Portugal and lived in a monastery for several months to gain weight. His performance received critical acclaim by film critics who notably praised the actor&#x27;s emotional courage in portraying the character&#x27;s physical and mental degradation. Peter Travers from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented that Leto &quot;excels by going beyond Harry&#x27;s gaunt look to capture his grieving heart. His scenes with Ellen Burstyn as Sara, Harry&#x27;s widowed mother, achieve a rare poignancy as son and mother drown in delusions.&quot;

Leto next appeared in the independent film &quot;Highway&quot;. Set in 1994, Jack Hayes (Leto) is caught with the wife of his employer, a Vegas thug, and flees to Seattle with his best friend, Pilot Kelvin (Jake Gyllenhaal), in the week preceding Kurt Cobain&#x27;s suicide. Filming finished in early 2000, but the film was not released until March 2002 on home video formats, although originally scheduled for a theatrical release.

During this period Leto focused increasingly on his music career, working with producers Bob Ezrin and Brian Virtue on his band&#x27;s debut album &quot;30 Seconds to Mars&quot;, which was released on August 27, 2002, in the United States through Immortal and Virgin. It reached number 107 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number one on the US Top Heatseekers. Upon its release, &quot;30 Seconds to Mars&quot; was met with mostly positive reviews; music critic Megan O&#x27;Toole felt that the band managed to &quot;carve out a unique niche for themselves in the rock realm.&quot; The album was a slow-burning success, and eventually sold two million copies worldwide.

Leto returned to acting in 2002 with the thriller &quot;Panic Room&quot;, which marked his second teaming with director David Fincher. He played the supporting role of Junior, a burglar who terrorizes Jodie Foster&#x27;s character Meg Altman. The film was well received by critics and became a financial success, grossing nearly US$200 million worldwide. Leto&#x27;s next film was the 2004 biographical film &quot;Alexander&quot;, directed by Oliver Stone. He portrayed Hephaestion, the closest friend of Alexander the Great. The film failed in the United States; Stone attributed its poor reception to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander&#x27;s bisexuality, but it succeeded internationally, with worldwide revenue of US$167 million.

The following year, Leto starred together with Nicolas Cage in the political crime thriller &quot;Lord of War&quot;. He played Vitaly, the younger brother of illegal arms dealer Yuri Orlov. The film was officially endorsed by the human rights group Amnesty International for highlighting the arms trafficking by the international arms industry. It was positively received by movie critics and was a moderate commercial success.

It took two years to record Thirty Seconds to Mars&#x27; second studio album &quot;A Beautiful Lie&quot;, with the band traveling to four different continents to accommodate Leto&#x27;s acting career. &quot;A Beautiful Lie&quot; was released on August 30, 2005, in the United States. It has since been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has reached platinum and gold status in several countries, with a sales total of over four million. The band heavily toured in support of the album and played at several major festivals, including Roskilde, Pinkpop, Rock am Ring, and Download.

===2006–2008: &quot;Lonely Hearts&quot;, &quot;Chapter 27&quot;, and filmmaking===

In 2006, Leto appeared in the neo-noir crime drama &quot;Lonely Hearts&quot;, the true story of the notorious &quot;lonely hearts killers&quot; of the 1940s, Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck. Playing Fernandez, he co-starred with Salma Hayek who played the role of Beck. The film received mixed reviews from critics; however, Leto&#x27;s acting was widely praised; Heather Huntington from Reelz wrote that his &quot;layered performance as the nattily dressing dandy with no remorse is truly impressive.&quot;

The same year, Leto directed the music video for &quot;The Kill&quot;, a song by Thirty Seconds to Mars. At a press release, he stated that an &quot;insanely obnoxious Danish albino&quot; named Bartholomew Cubbins directed the video. He later explained his decision to direct with a pseudonym saying, &quot;I really wanted people to be able to enjoy and experience the video without having any more preconceived notions or distractions, and just to let it be what it was. It wasn&#x27;t important for me to lay claim to it in that way.&quot; Bartholomew Cubbins is a recurring character in the Dr. Seuss universe and one of Leto&#x27;s favorite characters created by the writer. &quot;The Kill&quot; was inspired by themes of isolation and insanity present in the Stanley Kubrick-directed psychological horror film &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980). Leto said, &quot;The idea of isolation, identity, and self discovery were all elements present in the song. I thought this light homage was a good starting point and it soon grew to include many more elements outside of Kubrick&#x27;s original piece.&quot; The short film received a largely positive response and numerous accolades, including an MTV Video Music Award. Leto next directed a short film for &quot;From Yesterday&quot;. It was filmed in the Forbidden City and became the first ever American music video shot in the People&#x27;s Republic of China in its entirety. Hundreds of costumed extras were employed for the shoot, inspired by the empires of ancient Chinese dynasties. Leto drew inspiration from Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s historical drama &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; (1987) as well as the work of Akira Kurosawa.

In 2007, Leto starred in the biographical film &quot;Chapter 27&quot;. He portrayed Mark David Chapman, a fanatic fan of The Beatles and the murderer of John Lennon. Leto prepared for his role by relying on interviews with Chapman and on audiotapes recorded by a librarian the actor met during a visit to the inmate&#x27;s hometown. Leto gained 67 pounds to approximate the killer&#x27;s physique. The abruptness of his weight gain gave him gout. He was forced to use a wheelchair due to the stress the sudden increase in weight put on his body. After the shooting of the film, he quickly went on a liquid diet. &quot;Chapter 27&quot; premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival. Despite divided critical opinion on the film as a whole, Leto&#x27;s performance was widely praised. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; considered his acting &quot;a genuine transformation, as the actor submerges himself in Chapman&#x27;s couch-potato flab and red-rimmed eyes. ... Leto disappears inside this angry, mouth-breathing psycho geek with a conviction that had me hanging on his every delusion.&quot;

Leto&#x27;s next short film was &quot;A Beautiful Lie&quot; (2008), which he directed under the pseudonym of Angakok Panipaq. The music video was filmed 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Greenland. Determined to offset the impact that filming would have on the environment, Leto worked with the Natural Resources Defense Council to develop strategies that would minimize fuel consumption on the shoot. Upon release, &quot;A Beautiful Lie&quot; was met with widespread critical acclaim, resulting in various accolades, including the MTV Europe Music Award for Best Video. Proceeds from the video&#x27;s sales benefited the Natural Resources Defense Council. The same year, Leto remixed a version of the song &quot;The Only One&quot; by The Cure for their extended play &quot;Hypnagogic States&quot;.

===2008–2011: EMI lawsuit, &quot;This Is War&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Nobody&quot;===

In August 2008, during the recording process of their third studio album, Thirty Seconds to Mars attempted to sign with a new label, prompting EMI (the parent label of Virgin), to file a $30 million breach of contract lawsuit. After nearly a year of legal battles, the band announced on April 28, 2009, that the suit had been settled following a defence based on the De Havilland Law. Thirty Seconds to Mars then signed a new contract with EMI and released their third album &quot;This Is War&quot; in December 2009 to critical acclaim. &quot;This Is War&quot; reached the top ten of several national album charts and earned numerous music awards.
Leto&#x27;s next film was the 2009 science fiction drama &quot;Mr. Nobody&quot;, directed by Jaco Van Dormael. He portrayed the title role of Nemo Nobody, the last mortal on Earth after the human race has achieved quasi-immortality. His role required him to play various versions of his character, from 34 to 118 years old, spending six hours daily for the full make-up and adopting the voice of an old-aged man. &quot;Mr. Nobody&quot; premiered at the 2009 Venice Film Festival. Critical response praised the film&#x27;s artistry and Leto&#x27;s performance. Boyd van Hoeij from &quot;Variety&quot; felt that &quot;his acting talent really comes into full view in his scenes as the last dying man on Earth. Despite too much old-age makeup, Leto nevertheless infuses the character with some real raw emotional power;&quot; while Bruce Kirkland of &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; claimed that Leto gave &quot;a marvelously full-blooded, brain-spinning, tour-de-force performance.&quot;

In 2009, Leto recruited scores of extras and all manner of surrealist street performers for the short film of &quot;Kings and Queens&quot;, which features a critical mass movement founded with forward-thinking and eco-conscious intentions, through Los Angeles at night. The short film premiered on November 9, 2009, at the Montalban Theater in Los Angeles and was positively received. At the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, &quot;Kings and Queens&quot; received four nominations, including Video of the Year and Best Direction, and went on to win Best Rock Video. Thirty Seconds to Mars began their Into the Wild Tour in February 2010 and was among the hardest-working touring artists of the year.

Leto filmed &quot;Closer to the Edge&quot; (2010), a short film featuring tour footage, fan commentary and pictures of Thirty Seconds to Mars from their youth, during the band&#x27;s Into the Wild Tour. Critics lauded the simplicity of the video; James Montgomery from MTV wrote, &quot;there&#x27;s no denying the power of seeing tens of thousands of fans finding a simultaneous salvation, of a crowd of individuals becoming one. It&#x27;s what rock and roll is supposed to be about, really: inclusion.&quot; In December 2011, Thirty Seconds to Mars entered the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; for most live shows during a single album cycle, with 300 shows.

Leto&#x27;s next project was &quot;Hurricane&quot; (2010), an experimental short film which explores personal demons and unlocking secret fantasies in what is believed to be a dream. Leto filmed it in New York City and described its concept as a &quot;surrealistic nightmare dream-fantasy.&quot; Upon release, &quot;Hurricane&quot; garnered controversy and was initially censored due to its elements of violence. At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, the short film received three nominations in the categories of Best Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Editing.

===2012–2013: &quot;Artifact&quot;; &quot;Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams&quot; and &quot;Dallas Buyers Club&quot; ===
In 2012, Leto made his directorial debut with the documentary film &quot;Artifact&quot;. It chronicles the modern music business as it charts the legal dispute between Thirty Seconds to Mars and EMI, after the band tried to exit its contract over a royalties dispute. &quot;Artifact&quot; was made on a limited budget provided by Leto and personal assistant Emma Ludbrook through the production company Sisyphus Corporation. It premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival where it received the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Best Documentary. Critics praised the examination of the state of the modern music industry and its focus on the relationship between artists and record companies. The film received a limited theatrical release beginning November 23, 2013, before being released digitally on December 3, 2013.
Thirty Seconds to Mars released their fourth album, &quot;Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams&quot;, in May 2013 through Interscope Records. The album was produced by Leto with previous collaborator Steve Lillywhite. It received generally positive reviews and reached the top ten in more than fifteen countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States. Leto filmed the 2013 short film for &quot;Up in the Air&quot; at a now-defunct aerospace manufacturing building in Los Angeles, California. He described it as a &quot;bizarre and hallucinogenic journey through an incredibly surreal landscape.&quot; The short film features several artists, including burlesque dancer Dita Von Teese, gymnasts McKayla Maroney and Jordyn Wieber, writer Neil Strauss and a number of animals. It garnered several awards, including the MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video, and competed at the 2013 Camerimage.

Leto described the concept of his next short film, &quot;Do or Die&quot; (2013), as a companion piece to &quot;Closer to the Edge&quot; (2010). It was filmed during the Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams Tour and features live footage of Thirty Seconds to Mars onstage as well as fan commentary. The same year, Leto directed the critically praised short film for &quot;City of Angels&quot;, which premiered on October 12, 2013, at the Hollywood Bowl. The music video features a number of celebrities who join the three members of Thirty Seconds to Mars in sharing their visions about Los Angeles. Multiple monoliths and murals, including Michael Jackson and Marilyn Monroe impersonators, also appear, as well as homeless people hired by Leto himself for the video.

After a five years hiatus from filming, Leto returned to act in the drama &quot;Dallas Buyers Club&quot; (2013), directed by Jean-Marc Vallée and co-starring Matthew McConaughey. Leto portrayed Rayon, a drug-addicted transgender woman with AIDS who befriends McConaughey&#x27;s character Ron Woodroof. In order to accurately portray his role, Leto lost 30 pounds, shaved his eyebrows and waxed his entire body. He stated the portrayal was grounded in his meeting transgender people while researching the role. During filming, Leto refused to break character. &quot;Dallas Buyers Club&quot; received widespread critical acclaim and became a financial success, resulting in various accolades for Leto, who was awarded the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role and a variety of film critics&#x27; circle awards for the role.

===2014–2021: From &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; to &quot;America&quot; ===

In 2014, Leto premiered the documentary series &quot;Into the Wild&quot;, which tells the story behind the concert tour of the same name by Thirty Seconds to Mars that propelled the group into arenas around the world and was certified by the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the longest running tour in the history of rock music. The series was produced by Leto and Emma Ludbrook and was released through the online platform VyRT. On November 3, 2015, it was announced that Thirty Seconds to Mars were working on their fifth studio album.

In December of that year, Warner Bros. confirmed that Leto would play the role of the Joker in &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (2016), a supervillain film based on the comic book series of the same name. Leto received some attention for his method acting during the film&#x27;s production. Fellow &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; cast member Will Smith, who played Deadshot in the film, stated that he had &quot;never actually met Jared Leto&quot;, saying, &quot;We worked together for six months and we&#x27;ve never exchanged a word outside of &#x27;action!&#x27; and &#x27;cut!&#x27; We&#x27;ve never said &#x27;hello,&#x27; we&#x27;ve never said &#x27;good day.&#x27; I&#x27;ve only ever spoken to him as Deadshot and him as the Joker. I literally have not met him yet... Not a single word exchanged off-camera. He was all in on the Joker.&quot;

Leto&#x27;s method acting on &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; also reportedly involved sending unorthodox gifts to his fellow cast members, including live rats and bullets. His co-star Margot Robbie said that he gifted her a live rat, which she stated she kept as a pet until her landlord discovered it. Speaking with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Viola Davis stated, &quot;He did some bad things, Jared Leto did. He gave some really horrific gifts. He had a henchman who would come into the rehearsal room, and the henchman came in with a dead pig and plopped it on the table, and then he walked out. And that was our introduction into Jared Leto.&quot; In an interview with &quot;E! News&quot; at the film&#x27;s premiere in 2016, Leto claimed that he also sent anal beads and used condoms to his co-stars, stating, &quot;I did a lot of things to create a dynamic, to create an element of surprise, of spontaneity, and to really break down any kind of walls that may be there. The Joker is somebody who doesn&#x27;t really respect things like personal space or boundaries.&quot;

In a 2021 interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Leto claimed that the comments he made at &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; premiere were &quot;in jest&quot;, and stated that, &quot;there were no used condoms [...] Any of the very few gifts that were ever given were given with a spirit of fun and adventure and received with laughter, fun, and adventure. It&#x27;s all filmed! They filmed it all! People were dying. We were just having a goof.&quot; Regarding the rat he reportedly gave Robbie, he stated, &quot;The only gifts I ever gave Margot were cupcakes. I think I gave her a mouse, and some of the other guys got gifts that you&#x27;d get as a joke at a party.&quot; He also added, &quot;I&#x27;m an artist at the end of the day. If I do something risky and you don&#x27;t like it, basically, you can kiss my ass.&quot;

&quot;Suicide Squad&quot; opened to generally negative reviews from critics, but Leto&#x27;s performance received some praise from critics despite his character&#x27;s limited screen time. Following the film&#x27;s release, Leto expressed interest in reprising his role as the Joker in future DC Extended Universe instalments. In October 2020, it was reported that Leto would reprise his role of the Joker in &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot;.

In April 2016, it was announced that Leto would appear in the film &quot;The Outsider&quot; (2018), directed by Martin Zandvliet. In August 2016, Thirty Seconds to Mars revealed they had signed to Interscope Records and confirmed that they were working on new music. That same month Leto was cast as the villain Niander Wallace in the 2017 film &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. Leto later also appeared in &quot;2036: Nexus Dawn&quot;, a promotional short film that takes place before &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; directed by Luke Scott and co-starring Benedict Wong.

From May to September 2017, Thirty Seconds to Mars embarked on a North American tour with Muse and PVRIS. Thirty Seconds to Mars then performed at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards featuring special guest Travis Scott. During the ceremony, Jared Leto received media attention for his tribute to musicians Chester Bennington and Chris Cornell, who both died earlier that year. In February 2018, the band officially announced the Monolith Tour with Walk the Moon, Misterwives, K. Flay, Joywave, and Welshly Arms. Thirty Seconds to Mars later confirmed &quot;America&quot; as title of their fifth album, which was released on April 6, 2018. The album received polarized reviews from critics and debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, becoming the band&#x27;s highest entry on the chart. It was promoted with an accompanying documentary film, &quot;A Day in the Life of America&quot;, directed by Leto and released in January 2021 to general praise.

===2021–present: &quot;The Little Things&quot;, &quot;House of Gucci&quot; and &quot;Morbius&quot; ===
Leto played suspected serial killer Albert Sparma in John Lee Hancock&#x27;s 2021 film &quot;The Little Things&quot;. The film earned him nominations for a Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award—both for Best Supporting Actor. Leto portrays fashion designer and business magnate Paolo Gucci in Ridley Scott&#x27;s biographical crime drama film &quot;House of Gucci&quot;, for which he was nominated for a Satellite Award, Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award and Screen Actors Guild Award.

He plays Adam Neumann alongside Anne Hathaway in Apple+&#x27;s 2022 &quot;WeCrashed&quot; about the rise and fall of the WeWork, for which he was nominated for a Best Actor in a Miniseries, Limited Series, or Motion Picture Made for Television. In November 2017, Sony Pictures announced plans for a film adaptation of Morbius, the Living Vampire, which is part of Sony&#x27;s Spider-Man Universe. On June 27, 2018, it was announced that Leto would star, and Daniel Espinosa would direct. The film was released on 1 April 2022. On July 30, 2022, it was announced that Leto would star in a film directed by Justin Simien titled &quot;Haunted Mansion&quot; for Disney. The film was released on July 28, 2023.

He will next star as the character Ares in &quot;&quot;, a new instalment in the &quot;Tron&quot; franchise, which began production after several delays. On December 20, 2024, it was announced that Leto was cast as Skeletor in the Masters of the Universe reboot.

==Other work==

===Business ventures===
After the strong relationship between Thirty Seconds to Mars and its audience, Leto launched the social media management and digital marketing company The Hive. It is based in Studio City, Los Angeles and focuses on creative community building. In recent years, it has expanded to other artists such as Jessie J and Semi Precious Weapons. In 2010, Leto launched The One and Only Golden Tickets, a full service company which operates worldwide and manages exclusive services for concerts, festivals, and events. In 2013, the company was renamed Adventures In Wonderland.

In 2011, Leto launched the online platform VyRT. Created as a live video streaming service, it also features social networking and official merchandise. Its idea came from some frustrating experiences Leto faced with Thirty Seconds to Mars in streaming their own live events. In June 2012, VyRT was awarded Best Online Concert Experience at the O Music Awards. In 2012, Leto became an investor in Surf Air, a California-based air service. He is also a funder for Reddit and Robinhood Markets.

===Political views===
In 2008, he supported the California Proposition 2 regarding the treatment of farm animals. In the 2008 presidential election, Leto supported Senator Barack Obama of Illinois. In 2012, he chaired a Gen44 event, a campaign set up by Obama to energize voters under 40. Leto is a gay rights activist. In October 2009, he raised money for the campaign against California Proposition 8, created by opponents of same-sex marriage to overturn the California Supreme Court decision that had legalized same-sex marriage. He spoke out in support of the LGBT rights group Freedom Action Inclusion Rights (FAIR). In May 2012, he expressed support after hearing that Barack Obama had endorsed same-sex marriage.

===Philanthropy===
Leto has been active in several charitable pursuits. He has been volunteering at the charity Art of Elysium, which helps children with serious medical conditions. He has supported the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes, a program specializing in type 1 diabetes research and care. In 2006, he created the cover art for the album &quot;97X Green Room: Volume 2&quot;, which proceeds from the sales benefited The Nature Conservancy. In June 2008, he joined Habitat for Humanity to work with Thirty Seconds to Mars on a home being repaired and renovated through the Greater Los Angeles Area&#x27;s &quot;A Brush With Kindness&quot; programme. He also supported Habitat for Humanity in Sentul, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Leto has supported Aid Still Required, a non-profit corporation committed to bringing attention and humanitarian aid to areas suffering from natural disasters or human crises. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, he released a book of photographs taken during his trip to the Caribbean country in 2011, in a bid to raise funds for the earthquake-ravaged country. He has connected with and helped various organizations since arriving there, including J/P Haitian Relief Organization. Leto spent a year in Haiti during his childhood, and returned there in January 2011 to &quot;reconnect&quot; with his former home following the tremor of January 2010. On September 30, 2014, Leto hosted the event &quot;Haiti: The Journey Is the Destination&quot; in New York City, benefitting those affected by the 2010 earthquake in the Caribbean country. In February 2015, Leto was named a global ambassador for World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), supporting online fundraisers and leading one for his 47th birthday in 2018.

==Personal life==
He began dating actress Cameron Diaz in 1999 and the couple became engaged in 2000. In 2003, Leto and Diaz ended their four-year relationship. From 2015 to 2022, he was in a relationship with Russian model Valery Kaufman.

Leto is teetotal.

<doc id="483365" wikidata="Q1229529" url="?curid=483365" title="Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) is a third-level military decoration awarded for gallantry during active operations against the enemy at sea to officers; and, since 1993, ratings and other ranks of the British Armed Forces, Royal Fleet Auxiliary and the British Merchant Navy have been eligible. The award was formerly also awarded to members of armed forces of other Commonwealth countries.

The DSC is &quot;awarded in recognition of an act or acts of exemplary gallantry during active operations against the enemy at sea.&quot; Since 1979, it can be awarded posthumously.

==History==
The award was originally created in 1901 as the Conspicuous Service Cross, for award to warrant and subordinate officers, including midshipmen, ineligible for the Distinguished Service Order. It was renamed the Distinguished Service Cross in October 1914, eligibility being extended to all naval officers (commissioned and warrant) below the rank of lieutenant commander.

From March 1915, foreign officers of equivalent rank in allied navies could receive honorary awards; in August 1916, bars were introduced to reward further acts of gallantry meriting the Cross, with a silver rosette worn on the ribbon when worn alone, to denote the award of each bar. During World War I, officers of the Merchant and Fishing Fleets had been awarded the DSC, and their eligibility was legally clarified by an order in council in 1931.

World War II saw a number of changes. In December 1939, eligibility was extended to Naval Officers of the rank of Commander and Lieutenant-Commander. In April 1940, equivalent ranks in the Royal Air Force serving with the Fleet could receive the DSC, and, from November 1942, so could those in the Army aboard defensively equipped merchant ships.

Since the 1993 review of the honours system, as part of the drive to remove distinctions of rank in awards for bravery, the Distinguished Service Medal, formerly the third-level decoration for ratings, has been discontinued. The DSC now serves as the third-level award for gallantry at sea for all ranks, not to the standard required to receive the Victoria Cross or the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross.

The DSC had also been awarded by Commonwealth countries; however, by the 1990s, most of these—including Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—were establishing their own honours systems and no longer recommended British honours.

Recipients are entitled to the post-nominal &quot;DSC&quot;.

==Description==
The DSC is a plain silver cross with rounded ends, with a width of and with the following design:
* The obverse has a circular centre containing the Royal Cypher of the reigning monarch at the time of award surmounted by a crown.
* The reverse is plain apart from the hallmark, and the ribbon is attached via a hallmarked silver ring. From 1940, the year of issue was engraved on lower limb of cross, and since 1984 it has been awarded named to the recipient.
* The ribbon has three equal stripes of dark blue, white, and dark blue.
* The ribbon bar denoting a further award is plain silver, with convex ends and a central crown.

== Recipients ==
===Numbers awarded===
Since 1901 at least 6,658 Crosses and 603 bars have been awarded. The dates below reflect the relevant London Gazette entries:
A number of honorary awards were made to members of allied foreign forces, including 151 for World War I, and 228 (with 12 first bars and 2 second bars) for World War II. Eight honorary awards were made in 1955 to members of the US Navy for service in Korea.

The above table includes awards to the Dominions:&lt;br&gt;In all, 199 DSCs have gone to those serving with Canadian forces, with 34 first bars and five second bars. It was replaced in 1993 by the Medal of Military Valour.&lt;br&gt;
182 were awarded to Australians, in addition to 13 first bars and three second bars. Last awarded to an Australian in 1972, it was replaced in 1991 by the Medal for Gallantry.

===Four-time recipient===
Only one person has ever been awarded the Distinguished Service Cross four times. Norman Eyre Morley served in the Royal Naval Reserve during World War I and World War II. He was awarded the DSC for the first time in 1919. He was awarded his second DSC in 1944. He was awarded the DSC a further two times in 1945.

<doc id="483375" wikidata="Q10508905" url="?curid=483375" title="Prehensile tail">
<text>A prehensile tail is the tail of an animal that has adapted to grasp or hold objects. Fully prehensile tails can be used to hold and manipulate objects, and in particular to aid arboreal creatures in finding and eating food in the trees. If the tail cannot be used for this it is considered only partially prehensile; such tails are often used to anchor an animal&#x27;s body to dangle from a branch, or as an aid for climbing. The term &quot;prehensile&quot; means &quot;able to grasp&quot; (from the Latin &quot;prehendere&quot;, to take hold of, to grasp).

==Evolution==

One point of interest is the distribution of animals with prehensile tails. The prehensile tail is predominantly a New World adaptation, especially among mammals. Many more animals in South America have prehensile tails than in Africa and Southeast Asia. It has been argued that animals with prehensile tails are more common in South America because the forest there is denser than in Africa or Southeast Asia. In contrast, less dense forests such as in Southeast Asia have been observed to have more abundant gliding animals such as colugos or flying snakes; few gliding vertebrates are found in South America. South American rainforests also differ by having more lianas, as there are fewer large animals to eat them than in Africa and Asia; the presence of lianas may aid climbers but obstruct gliders. Curiously, Australia-New Guinea contains many mammals with prehensile tails and also many mammals which can glide; in fact, all Australian mammalian gliders have tails that are prehensile to an extent.

==Anatomy and physiology==

Tails are mostly a feature of vertebrates; however, some invertebrates such as scorpions also have appendages that can be considered tails. However, only vertebrates are known to have developed prehensile tails. Many mammals with prehensile tails will have a bare patch to aid gripping. This bare patch is known as a &quot;friction pad&quot;.

==Animals with fully prehensile tails==

===Mammals===

*New World monkeys. Many New World monkeys in the family Atelidae, which includes howler monkeys, spider monkeys and woolly monkeys, have grasping tails often with a bare tactile pad. This is in contrast with their distant Old World monkey cousins who do not have prehensile tails.
*Opossum. A marsupial group from the Americas. The tail is occasionally used as a grip to carry bunches of leaves or bedding materials to the nest.
*Platypus. The semi-aquatic monotreme found in Australia. Much the same as Opossums, Platypuses gather leaves to line their nests, using their tails to carry the materials they&#x27;ve collected.
*Anteaters. Anteaters are found in Central and South America. Three of the four species of anteater, the silky anteater and the two species of tamandua, have prehensile tails.
*Binturong. One of the few Old World animals with fully prehensile tails, although they use only the tip of the tail.
*Kinkajou. The kinkajou of South and Central America is the only other animal of the order Carnivora, besides the binturong, to sport the adaptation.
*Harvest mouse. Another Old World mammal, the harvest mouse (&quot;Micromys minutus&quot;) also has a fully prehensile tail. It is commonly found amongst areas of tall grasses such as cereal crops (particularly wheat and oats), roadside verges, hedgerows, reedbeds, dykes and salt-marshes.
*New World porcupines of the genera &quot;Coendou&quot; and &quot;Chaetomys&quot; have fully prehensile tails that help them to climb and prevent them from falling from trees.
*Tree pangolin. One of the few Old World mammals with a fully prehensile tail.
*&quot;Microgale longicaudata&quot;, an arboreal species of the tenrec family.

===Fish===
*Seahorses. Seahorses have fully prehensile tails, which they use to attach themselves to objects such as seagrass, algae, sponges, corals, or even man-made objects.

==Animals with partially prehensile tails==

===Mammals===
*New World monkeys. The capuchin monkey. The capuchin is more than intelligent enough to make full use of its prehensile tail, but since the tail lacks an area of bare skin for a good grip it is only used in climbing and dangling. Other reasons for partial prehensility might include the lack of strength or flexibility in the tail, or simply having no need to manipulate objects with it.
*Tree porcupines. The 15 species of tree porcupine (genus &quot;Coendou&quot;). They are found in South America, with one species extending to Mexico. All have prehensile tails.
*Rats have been known to be able to wrap the tail around an object after running around it, therefore giving the creature a small bit of balance. They have also been seen to be able to briefly hang off an object, though not for long.
*Possums. This large, diverse group of 63 species forms the marsupial suborder Phalangeriformes, found in Australia, New Guinea, and some nearby islands. All members of the suborder have prehensile tails; however, the tails of some members such as the Acrobatidae have only limited prehensile capacity. Notably, all three marsupial glider groups belong to this suborder.
*Potoroidae. A marsupial group found in Australia that includes the bettongs and the potoroos. They have weakly prehensile tails.
*Monito del monte. A small South American marsupial with a prehensile tail.

===Reptiles===

*Prehensile-tailed skink. Several kinds of skink (e.g. &quot;Corucia zebrata&quot;) have partially prehensile tails.
*Chameleons.
*Snakes. Many snakes have prehensile tails (or a prehensile body)
*Crested gecko and their relatives have prehensile tails
*Alligator lizard. Some alligator lizards such as the southern alligator lizard, the Texas alligator lizard, and the arboreal alligator lizards (genus &quot;Abronia&quot;) have prehensile tails.
*Big-headed turtle, and juvenile specimens of the family Chelydridae.
*&quot;Urocoyledon rasmusseni&quot;

===Amphibians===

*Salamanders. A number of North American forest-dwelling climbing salamanders have prehensile tails that help them climb. Some are from the genus Aneides such as the clouded salamander (&quot;Aneides ferreus&quot;), the wandering salamander (&quot;Aneides vagrans&quot;), and the arboreal salamander (&quot;Aneides lugubris&quot;). Others are the large Red Hills salamander (&quot;Phaeognathus hubrichti&quot;) and the cave salamander (&quot;Eurycea lucifuga&quot;). There are also the Central American &quot;Bolitoglossa sombra&quot; and Mexican and Central American &quot;Bolitoglossa mexicana&quot; salamanders.

===Fish===

*Syngnathidae. Many species from this group, which includes seahorses and pipefish, have prehensile tails.

<text>L0phtCrack is a password auditing and recovery application originally produced by Mudge from L0pht Heavy Industries. It is used to test password strength and sometimes to recover lost Microsoft Windows passwords, by using dictionary, brute-force, hybrid attacks, and rainbow tables.

The initial version was released in the Spring of 1997.

The application was produced by @stake after the L0pht merged with @stake in 2000. @stake was then acquired by Symantec in 2004. Symantec later stopped selling this tool to new customers, citing US Government export regulations, and discontinued support in December 2006.

In January 2009, L0phtCrack was acquired by the original authors Zatko, Wysopal, and Rioux from Symantec. L0phtCrack 6 was announced on 11 March 2009 at the SOURCE Boston Conference. L0phtCrack 6 contains support for 64-bit Windows platforms as well as upgraded rainbow tables support. L0phtCrack 7 was released on 30 August 2016, seven years after the previous release. L0phtCrack 7 supports GPU cracking, increasing performance up to 500 times that of previous versions.

On April 21, 2020, Terahash announced it had acquired L0phtCrack. Details of the sale were not released.

On July 1, 2021 L0pht Holdings, LLC repossessed L0phtCrack after Terahash defaulted on its instalment sale loan. The current owners announced that they were exploring open source options for L0phtcrack. Due to commercial libraries existing within the software this may take some time.

On October 17, 2021 L0phtCrack version 7.2.0 was released open-source, with different portions of the software being published under different licenses.

<doc id="483378" wikidata="Q1725675" url="?curid=483378" title="Lamina propria">
<text>The lamina propria is a thin layer of connective tissue that forms part of the moist linings known as mucous membranes or mucosae, which line various tubes in the body, such as the respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, and the urogenital tract.

The lamina propria is a thin layer of loose (areolar) connective tissue, which lies beneath the epithelium, and together with the epithelium and basement membrane constitutes the mucosa. As its Latin name indicates, it is a characteristic component of the mucosa, or the mucosa&#x27;s &quot;own special layer.&quot; Thus, the term mucosa or mucous membrane refers to the combination of the epithelium and the lamina propria.

The connective tissue of the lamina propria is loose and rich in cells. The cells of the lamina propria are variable and can include fibroblasts, lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, eosinophilic leukocytes, and mast cells. It provides support and nutrition to the epithelium, as well as the means to bind to the underlying tissue. Irregularities in the connective tissue surface, such as papillae found in the tongue, increase the area of contact of the lamina propria and the epithelium.

==Structure==
The lamina propria is a loose connective tissue, hence it is not as fibrous as the underlying connective tissue of the submucosa. The connective tissue and architecture of the lamina propria is very compressible and elastic, this can be seen in organs that require expansion such as the bladder. The collagen in the lamina propria of elastic organs has been shown to play a major role in mechanical function. In the bladder the collagen composition of its lamina propria allows for structure, tensile strength, and compliance, through complex coiling. It has been suggested that myofibroblasts also reside in the lamina propria of several organs. These cells have characteristics of both smooth muscle and fibroblasts.
The lamina propria may also be rich in vascular networks, lymphatic vessels, elastic fibers, and smooth muscle fascicles from the muscularis mucosae. Afferent and efferent nerve endings can be found in the lamina propria as well. Immune cells as well as lymphoid tissue, including lymphoid nodules and capillaries, may be present. Smooth muscle fibers may be in the lamina propria, such as in the intestinal villi. It is practically void of fat cells. Lymphatics penetrate the mucosa and lie below the basement membrane of the epithelium, from there they drain the lamina propria. The fast rate of cell death and regeneration of the epithelium leaves behind many apoptotic cell bodies. These have been found to go into the lamina propria, most of which are inside its macrophages.

==Function==
===Role in the immune system===
Because the epithelium is often under external stress and is somewhat delicate, the lamina propria hosts many immune cells. In the intestinal tract the immune system must have tolerance to the normal intestinal flora, yet respond to pathogenic microorganisms. Imbalance of this causes inflammation diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease. The lamina propria’s richness in macrophages and lymphoid cells makes it a key place for immune responses to occur. It forms part of the barrier that protects internal tissues from external pathogenic microorganisms, especially from the gastrointestinal tract.

==Clinical significance==
Progression of epithelial cancer often relies on deep and regional lymph node invasion. The lamina propria, being one of the barriers to the submucosa, is an area where epithelial cancer invasion is of significance since lymphatic invasion is an independent predictor of lymph node metastasis, especially in gastric cancer. As soon as the tumors breach the basement membrane and reach the lamina propria, they are exposed to lymphatics which may increase the rate of metastasis and cancer progression. Deeper invasion into the submucosa will increase the exposure to lymphatics.

Long-standing inflammation is a risk factor for the development of cancer. The lamina propria macrophages when under much stress release pro-inflammatory signals that may lead to increased probability of developing cancer. An example of this is the overactivation of the IL-6/STAT3 pathway, which has been linked to colitis-associated cancer.

<text>Kifisia or Kifissia (also Kephisia or Cephissia; , ) is a municipality and one of the most affluent northern suburbs in the Athens agglomeration, Attica, Greece, mainly accessed via Kifissias Avenue, running all the way from central Athens up to Theseos Avenue in the suburb of Nea Erythraia. It has traditionally been home to rich Greek families and major Greek political families.

==Municipality==
The municipality Kifisia was formed during the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 3 former municipalities, that became municipal units:
*Ekali
*Kifisia
*Nea Erythraia

The municipality has an area of 35.100 km2, the municipal unit 25.937 km2.

==Geography==

Kifisia is situated in central Attica, at the western end of the forested Penteli mountain range. The small river Kifisos forms the western border of the municipality. Kifisia is situated 12 km northeast of Athens city centre. The built-up area of Kifisia is continuous with those of the neighbouring suburbs Lykovrysi, Nea Erythraia, Marousi and Pefki. Kifisia consists of the following neighbourhoods: Adames, Ano Kifisia, Kato Kifisia, Kefalari, Nea Kifisia and Politeia (or Politia). It is a green suburb with many parks and tree-lined streets.

The main thoroughfare is Kifisias Avenue, which connects Kifisia with central Athens and the A6 toll motorway. The Kifisia station is the north terminus of Athens Metro Line 1.

===Climate===
Kifisia has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) with hot, dry summers and cool, rainy winters. Owing to its higher elevation, Kifisia, like most of the northern part of Athens, has a significantly lower mean annual temperature than the center and the coastal parts of the city (16.1 °C) according to the 1956-2010 annual average of the adjacent weather station of Tatoi, though this has slightly increased in recent years.

Yearly precipitation totals around 450 mm, one of the highest values for the whole Athens basin, mostly due to the higher amounts of precipitation received caused by Lake-effect rain or snow from the Aegean Sea to the north-east in the winter months and the somewhat more frequent occasional summer thunderstorms, when compared to the rest of the city. Snow in particular, though not excessively common, can cause heavy disruption to daily life as it occasionally falls in large amounts during short periods. Notably, snow accumulation had reached 80 cm during a severe snowstorm on 4–6 January 2002.
==History==

===Antiquity===
Cephisia was a deme of ancient Athens. It was the home of the famous dramatist Menander (circa 342-291 BC). 
Cephisia had become a famous retreat of philosophers during the reign of the Roman emperor Hadrian, when the wealthy Herodes Atticus of Marathon, Greece built the Villa Cephisia. In his &quot;Attic Nights&quot;, Aulus Gellius describes the unique ambiance of intellectual ferment and aristocratic leisure in an idyllic setting which he created there. It was also the practice of Herodes to provide free instruction in philosophy for selected youths from Athens. 
The remains of some of his family funeral monuments lie at the centre of the town in Platonas Square. He also beautified a sanctuary to the Nymphs in the ravine of Kokkinara, in the nearby district of Kefalari.

===Medieval period ===

The history of Kifisia during the medieval period is obscure, but the remains of a monastery church dedicated to the Virgin of the Swallow (Panagia Chelidonas) is associated with a story about a battle fought there between local people and unspecified &quot;invaders&quot;. This chapel is a rare example of a monastery church originally provided with a fireplace, for the chimney remains.

===Ottoman Era===
During Ottoman period, in 1667, Kifisia was visited by the Turkish traveler Evliya Çelebi. He described a small country town set in a fertile plain of paradisaic beauty, with three hundred tile-roofed houses. Half the inhabitants of the town were Muslims and half were Christians. He records that there was a single mosque, without a minaret, and many small Christian chapels - some of which survive today.

===Post Greek Independence===
The temperature in Kifisia tends to be significantly lower than that of the city, so following the independence of Greece, it quickly became a summer resort of the ruling class of the new state.

The village was home to an Arvanitika speaking community, however due to its proximity to Athens, it has undergone a language shift. The popularity of Kifissia faded somewhat during the middle of the nineteenth century when the danger of raids by brigands who infested the nearby mountains was very real. However, the suppression of brigandage, and the arrival of the railway in 1885, led to the dramatic development of the area.

It became the fashion for wealthy Athenian families to build summer houses in Kifisia, and keen social competition led to the creation of a unique architectural ambiance, as villas in ever more exotic styles proliferated. For those unable to afford a summer house, many hotels were built, where the slightly less affluent could spend the holiday months rubbing shoulders with their social betters.

The heyday of Kifisia was probably during the inter-war period, when the leaders of the two main rival political parties frequented different hotels in the town together with their most important supporters.

===World War II and Civil War===
Following the liberation of Greece from German occupation in 1944, the British Royal Air Force ill-advisedly made its headquarters in Kefalari, taking over several hotels. With the outbreak of the Greek Civil War, the RAF personnel were first besieged, then forced to surrender, and marched across the mountains into northern Greece; being released in Trikala only after a truce had been arranged.

==Museums== 
The Goulandris Museum of Natural History is situated in the heart of Kifissia and has collections from the natural wildlife of the Greek territory.

==Economy==
Accenture, Aegean Airlines, Barcleys, BP, Eurobank Ergasias, Eltrak, Ellaktor, Kioleides, Ferrari Metaxa, Metro S.A., Volvo and others have their head office in Kifisia.

==Sports==

Kifissia has several sport clubs in different sports. From them, most notable are ZAON, club with many Panhellenic titles in Greek women volleyball, Kifissia AC that plays almost constantly in men volleyball first division (A1 Ethniki) and Nea Kifissia B.C. that plays in basketball first division (Greek Basket League). The football team of Kifissia is Kifissia F.C., and plays in Super League Greece (top division). Kifissia also is the seat of Athina 90 (most times winner in Futsal League), AOH Hymettus (most times winner in Field Hockey League), and Iraklis Kifissias Presence in A1 Womans Category, with more than 200 athletes in Iraklis Kifissias Volleyball Academy.

==Historical population==
The population grew fast between 1991-2001 by 18,3% while in 2001-2011 the percentage was lower, 7.13% 

==Notable people==
*Menander (circa 342-291 BC), dramatist, born in Kifisia

<text>Chalandri (, Ancient Greek: Φλύα, &quot;Phlya&quot;, also &quot;Halandri&quot;, &quot;Khalandri&quot;) is a town and a suburb in the northern part of the Athens agglomeration, Greece. It is a municipality of the Attica region.

==Geography==

Chalandri is a suburb in Northern Athens, around from the centre; its location corresponds with one of the 10 ancient demes (boroughs) of Athens, known as Phlya (). The municipality has an area of 10.805 km2. Chalandri was a small village until the rapid expansion of Athens during the 1960s and 1970s. Its built-up area is now continuous with those of the neighbouring suburbs Filothei, Marousi, Vrilissia, Agia Paraskevi, Cholargos, Neo Psychiko and Psychiko. Nevertheless, it has still a high ratio of open green areas per citizen in the Athens agglomeration. Several embassies are based in Chalandri. It is one of the largest suburbs in terms of population, with more than 70,000 residents. It holds an independent municipality status since 1944. Chalandri is served by the Chalandri, Agia Paraskevi, Doukissis Plakentias as well as Nomismatokopio and Cholargos metro station (the latter two being shared with Papagou-Cholargos).

<text>Agia Paraskevi (, &quot;Agía Paraskeví&quot;) is a suburb and a municipality in the northeastern part of the Athens agglomeration, Greece. It is part of the North Athens regional unit. Agia Paraskevi was named after the main church of the town, which is dedicated to Saint Paraskevi of Rome.

==Geography==

Agia Paraskevi is situated near the northern edge of the forested Hymettus mountain range, northeast of Athens city center. The municipality has an area of 7.935 km2. The built-up area of Agia Paraskevi is continuous with those of the neighboring Cholargos, Chalandri and Gerakas. Besides the central area around the Agia Paraskevi Square, Agia Paraskevi consists of 7 districts: Kontopefko, Nea Zoi, Tsakos, Stavros, Aigiannis, Pefkakia and Paradeisos. The National Center of Scientific Research Demokritos, which hosts the sole nuclear reactor in Greece, is situated in Agia Paraskevi. It is also home of the Greek Ministry of Agriculture.

The main thoroughfare is Mesogeion Avenue, which connects Agia Paraskevi with central Athens. The eastern beltway A62 motorway passes through the southeastern part of the municipality. The municipality is served by several metro stations and a suburban railway station, located in adjacent municipalities.

==History==

Agia Paraskevi was part of the community of Chalandri until 1931, when it became a separate community. It became a municipality in 1963. Formerly a farmers&#x27; village, it experienced much suburban development since the 1950s.

In 1993, there was considerable opposition from inhabitants of the suburb to the construction of the A62 Hymettus Ring Road. The ring road was to form a major highway on the mountainside linked directly to the A6, and the construction of both motorways were to commence immediately. The realization that this plan would demand the felling of a considerable number of trees, as well as spurring an increase in noise pollution, predictably aroused the opposition of the local population, who requested a different solution: a covered road. However, the government would not reverse the decision and, in fact, sent bulldozers to the mountainside. This led to a riot in April, 1993. Thousands of people traveled up the mountainside and faced the bulldozers, forcing the drivers to leave. At length police arrived and managed to force the demonstrators off the site; eventually the construction of the two highways began, and was completed in 2001. The road was covered only at a small section, that running over the Deree College.

== Cultural clubs and activities ==

The following cultural clubs, activities and workshops are available in Agia Paraskevi:

Municipal Conservatory, Art Workshops, Choir, Philharmonic Orchestra, Theater Group &amp; Drama Club, Dance Classes, Film Club and Open Air Cinema, Open University courses and various other cultural clubs that organize events throughout the year.

== Sports ==
The football team of the city is Agia Paraskevi F.C., known as &quot;Santa&quot;, attracting devoted fans. During the Olympic games in 2004, a part of the historical Marathon passed through Agia Paraskevi over Mesogeion avenue. Agia Paraskevi hosts also two basketball clubs with earlier presence in the higher national divisions, Basketball Agia Paraskevi and GS Agia Paraskevi.And P.A.O.D.A.P. city organization with individual sports like tennis, fighting sports and more.
==Education==

<text>Holargos (, also: &quot;Cholargos&quot;) is a town and a suburb in the Athens urban area, Greece, located northeast of the Athens city proper and about away from Syntagma Square. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Papagou-Cholargos, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 3.950 km2. The main thoroughfare is Mesogeion Avenue, which connects Cholargos with central Athens and the A6 motorway.

Cholargos was the name of a deme of ancient Attica. The most prominent citizen of ancient Cholargos was Pericles. Cholargos was part of the community of Chalandri until 1933, when it became a separate community. It became a municipality in 1963.

== Climate ==
Cholargos, as most of Attica, features a typical Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Because of its location at the base of mountain Hymettus, Cholargos is strongly influenced by cold air masses that travel down the mountain, hence it is cooler that most of Athens, like downtown Athens or seaside locations.

Below is the data for the Nomismatokpeio Station. The station is active since 1 July 2020, so 2021 is the only year which was registered whole.

The following chart is not highly accurate, since it features only one year of record, but can be used as a guideline.

<doc id="483395" wikidata="Q5255948" url="?curid=483395" title="Demographic history of Macedonia">
<text>The region of Macedonia is known to have been inhabited since Paleolithic times.

==Еarliest historical inhabitants==
The earliest historical inhabitants of the region were the Pelasgians, the Bryges and the Thracians. The Pelasgians occupied Emathia and the Bryges occupied northern Epirus, as well as Macedonia, mainly west of the Axios River and parts of Mygdonia. Thracians, in early times occupied mainly the eastern parts of Macedonia, (Mygdonia, Crestonia, Bisaltia). The Ancient Macedonians are missing from early historical accounts because they had been living in the southern extremities of the region – the Orestian highlands – since before the Dark Ages. The Macedonian tribes subsequently moved down from Orestis in the upper Haliacmon due to pressure from the Orestae.

== Ancient Macedonians ==
The name of the region of Macedonia (, &quot;Makedonia&quot;) derives from the tribal name of the ancient Macedonians (, &quot;Makedónes&quot;). According to the Greek historian Herodotus, the &quot;Makednoi&quot; () were a Dorian tribe that stayed behind during the great southward migration of the Dorian Greeks. The word &quot;Makednos&quot; is cognate with the Doric Greek word &quot;Μάκος&quot; &quot;Μakos&quot; (Attic form Μήκος – &quot;mékos&quot;), which is Greek for &quot;length&quot;. The ancient Macedonians took this name either because they were physically tall, or because they settled in the mountains. The latter definition would translate &quot;Macedonian&quot; as &quot;Highlander&quot;.

The Macedonians (, &quot;Makedónes&quot;) were an ancient tribe that lived on the alluvial plain around the rivers Haliacmon and lower Axios in the northeastern part of mainland Greece. Essentially an ancient Greek people, they gradually expanded from their homeland along the Haliacmon valley on the northern edge of the Greek world, absorbing or driving out neighbouring non-Greek tribes, primarily Thracian and Illyrian. They spoke Ancient Macedonian, which was either a sibling language to Ancient Greek or a Doric Greek dialect, although the prestige language of the region was at first Attic and then Koine Greek. Their religious beliefs mirrored those of other Greeks, following the main deities of the Greek pantheon, although the Macedonians continued Archaic burial practices that had ceased in other parts of Greece after the 6th century BC. Aside from the monarchy, the core of Macedonian society was its nobility. Similar to the aristocracy of neighboring Thessaly, their wealth was largely built on herding horses and cattle.

== Roman Macedonia ==

After the defeat of Andriscus in 148 BC, Macedonia officially became a province of the Roman Republic in 146 BC. Hellenization of the non-Greek population was not yet complete in 146 BC, and many of the Thracian and Illyrian tribes had preserved their languages. It is also possible that the ancient Macedonian tongue was still spoken, alongside Koine, the common Greek language of the Hellenistic era. From an early period, the Roman province of Macedonia included Epirus, Thessaly, parts of Thrace and Illyria, thus making the region of Macedonia permanently lose any connection with its ancient borders, and now be the home of a greater variety of inhabitants.

==Middle Ages==

Taking advantage of the desolation left by the nomadic tribes, Slavs settled in the Balkan Peninsula from the 6th century AD.
&quot;(see also: South Slavs)&quot;. Aided by the Avars and by Turkic Bulgars, Slavic tribes in the 6th century started a gradual invasion into the lands of Byzantium. They infiltrated into Macedonia and reached as far south as Thessaly and the Peloponnese, settling in isolated regions that the Byzantines called &quot;Sclavinias&quot;, until they were gradually pacified. Many Slavs came to serve as soldiers in Byzantine armies and settled in other parts of the Byzantine Empire. Slavic settlers assimilated many among the Romanised and Hellenised Paeonian, Illyrian and Thracian population of Macedonia, but pockets of tribes that fled to the mountains remained independent. A number of scholars today consider that present-day Aromanians (Vlachs), Sarakatsani and Albanians originate from these mountainous populations. The interaction between Romanised and non-Romanised indigenous peoples and the Slavs resulted in linguistic similarities which are reflected in modern Bulgarian, Albanian, Romanian and Macedonian, all of them members of the Balkan language area. The Slavs also occupied the hinterland of Thessaloniki, launching consecutive attacks on the city in 584, 586, 609, 620, and 622 AD, but never taking it. Detachments of Avars often joined the Slavs in their onslaughts, but the Avars did not form any lasting settlements in the region. A branch of the Bulgars led by khan Kuber, however, settled in western Macedonia and eastern Albania around 680 AD and also engaged in attacks on Byzantium together with the Slavs. By this time, several different ethnicities inhabited the whole Macedonia region, with South Slavs forming the overall majority in the northern fringes of Macedonia while Greeks dominated the highlands of western Macedonia, the central plains, and the coastline.

==Ottoman rule==
=== Muslims and Christians ===

The initial period of Ottoman rule led a depopulation of the plains and river valleys of Macedonia. The Christian population there fled to the mountains. Ottomans were largely brought from Asia Minor and settled parts of the region. Towns destroyed in Vardar Macedonia during the conquest were renewed, this time populated exclusively by Muslims. The Ottoman element in Macedonia was especially strong in the 17th and the 18th century with travellers defining the majority of the population, especially the urban one, as Muslim. The Ottoman population, however, sharply declined at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century on account of the incessant wars led by the Ottoman Empire, the low birth rate and the higher death toll of the frequent plague epidemics among Muslims than among Christians.

The Ottoman–Habsburg War (1683–1699), the subsequent flight of a substantial part of the Serbian population in Kosovo to Austria and the reprisals and looting during the Ottoman counteroffensive led to an influx of Albanian Muslims into Kosovo, northern and northwestern Macedonia. Being in the position of power, the Albanian Muslims managed to push out their Christian neighbours and conquered additional territories in the 18th and the 19th centuries. Pressures from central government following the first Russo-Turkish war that ended in 1774 and in which Ottoman Greeks were implicated as a &quot;fifth column&quot; led to the superficial Islamization of several thousand Greek-speakers in western Macedonia. These Greek Muslims retained their Greek language and identity, remained Crypto-Christians, and were subsequently called Vallahades by local Greek Orthodox Christians because apparently the only Turkish-Arabic they ever bothered to learn was how to say &quot;wa-llahi&quot; or &quot;by Allah&quot;. The destruction and abandoning of the Christian Aromanian city of Moscopole and other important Aromanian settlements in the southern Albania (Epirus-Macedonia) region in the second half of the 18th century caused a large-scale migration of thousands of Aromanians to the cities and villages of Western Macedonia, most notably to Bitola, Krushevo and surrounding regions. Thessaloniki also became the home of a large Jewish population following Spain&#x27;s expulsions of Jews after 1492. The Jews later formed small colonies in other Macedonian cities, most notably Bitola and Serres.

=== Hellenic idea ===

The rise of European nationalism in the 18th century led to the expansion of the Hellenic idea in Macedonia. Its main pillar throughout the centuries of Ottoman rule had been the indigenous Greek population of historical Macedonia. Under the influence of the Greek schools and the Patriarchate of Constantinople, however, it started to spread among the other orthodox subjects of the Empire as the urban Christian population of Slavic and Albanian origin started to view itself increasingly as Greek. The Greek language became a symbol of civilization and a basic means of communication between non-Muslims. The process of Hellenization was additionally reinforced after the abolition of the Bulgarian Archbishopric of Ohrid in 1767. Though with a predominantly Greek clergy, the Archbishopric did not yield to the direct order of Constantinople and had autonomy in many vital domains. However, the poverty of the Christian peasantry and the lack of proper schooling in villages preserved the linguistic diversity of the Macedonian countryside. The Hellenic idea reached its peak during the Greek War of Independence (1821–1829) which received the active support of the Greek Macedonian population as part of their struggle for the resurrection of Greek statehood. According to the &quot;Istituto Geografiko de Agostini&quot; of Rome, in 1903 in the vilayets of Selanik and Monastir Greek was the dominant language of instruction in the region:
==Macedonian question==

In Europe, the classic non-national states were the &quot;multi-ethnic empires&quot; such as the Ottoman Empire, ruled by a Sultan and the population belonged to many ethnic groups, which spoke many languages. The idea of nation state was an increasing emphasis during the 19th century, on the ethnic and racial origins of the nations. The most noticeable characteristic was the degree to which nation-states use the state as an instrument of &quot;national unity&quot;, in economic, social and cultural life. By the 19th century, the Ottomans had fallen well behind the rest of Europe in science, technology, and industry.

=== Bulgarian propaganda ===

By that time Bulgarians had initiated a purposeful struggle against the Greek clerics. Bulgarian religious leaders had realised that any further struggle for the rights of the Bulgarians in the Ottoman Empire could not succeed unless they managed to obtain at least some degree of autonomy from the Patriarchate of Constantinople. The foundation of the Bulgarian Exarchate in 1870, which included most of Macedonia by a firman of Sultan Abdülaziz was the direct result of the struggle of the Bulgarian Orthodox against the domination of the Greek Patriarchate of Constantinople in the 1850s and 1860s.

Afterward, in 1876 the Bulgarians revolted in the &quot;April uprising&quot;. The emergence of Bulgarian national sentiments was closely related to the re-establishment of the independent Bulgarian church. This rise of national awareness became known as the Bulgarian National Revival. However, the uprising was crushed by the Ottomans. As a result, on the Constantinople Conference in 1876 the predominant Bulgarian character of the Slavs in Macedonia reflected in the borders of future autonomous Bulgaria as it was drawn there. The Great Powers eventually gave their consent to variant, which excluded historical Macedonia and Thrace, and denied Bulgaria access to the Aegean sea, but otherwise incorporated all other regions in the Ottoman Empire inhabited by Bulgarians. At the last minute, however, the Ottomans rejected the plan with the secret support of Britain. Having its reputation at stake, Russia had no other choice but to declare war on the Ottomans in April 1877. The Treaty of San Stefano from 1878, which reflected the maximum desired by Russian expansionist policy, gave Bulgaria the whole of Macedonia except Thessaloniki, the Chalcidice peninsula and the valley of the Aliakmon.

The Congress of Berlin in the same year redistributed most Bulgarian territories that the previous treaty had given to the Principality of Bulgaria back to the Ottoman Empire. This included the whole of Macedonia. As a result, in late 1878, the Kresna–Razlog uprising – an unsuccessful Bulgarian revolt against the Ottoman rule in the region of Macedonia – broke out. However the decision taken at the Congress of Berlin soon turned the Macedonian question into &quot;the apple of constant discord&quot; between Serbia, Greece and Bulgaria. The Bulgarian national revival in Macedonia was not unopposed. The Greeks and Serbs, too, had national ambitions in the region, and believed that these could be furthered by a policy of cultural and linguistic dissimilation of the Macedonian Slavs, to be achieved through educational and church propaganda. Nonetheless, by the 1870s the Bulgarians were clearly the dominant national party in Macedonia. It was widely anticipated that the Macedonian Slavs would continue to evolve as an integral part of the Bulgarian nation, and that, in the event of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s demise, Macedonia would be included in a Bulgarian successor-state. That these anticipations proved false was due not to any intrinsic peculiarities of the Macedonian Slavs, setting them apart from the Bulgarians, but to a series of catastrophic events, which, over a period of seventy years, diverted the course of Macedonian history away from its presumed trend.

=== Serbian propaganda ===

A great contribution to the Serbian cause was made by an astronomer and historian from Trieste, Spiridon Gopčević (also known as Leo Brenner). Gopčević published in 1889 the ethnographic research &quot;Macedonia and Old Serbia&quot;, which defined more than three-quarters of the Macedonian population as Serbian.

The work of Gopčević was further developed by two Serbian scholars, geographer Jovan Cvijić and linguist Aleksandar Belić. Less extreme than Gopčević, Cvijić and Belić claimed only the Slavs of northern Macedonia were Serbian whereas those of southern Macedonia were identified as &quot;Macedonian Slavs&quot;, an amorphous Slavic mass that was neither Bulgarian, nor Serbian but could turn out either Bulgarian or Serbian if the respective people were to rule the region.

=== Greek propaganda ===
It was established by the end of the 19th century that the majority of the population of central and Southern Macedonia (vilaets of Monastiri and Thessaloniki) were predominantly an ethnic Greek population, while the Northern parts of the region (vilaet of Skopje) were predominantly Slavic. Jews and Ottoman communities were scattered all over. Because of Macedonia&#x27;s such polyethnic nature, the arguments which Greece used to promote its claim to the whole region were usually of historical and religious character. The Greeks consistently linked nationality to the allegiance to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. &quot;Bulgarophone&quot;, &quot;Albanophone&quot; and &quot;Vlachophone&quot; Greeks were coined to describe the population who were Slavic, Albanian or Vlach (Aromanian)-speaking. There was also pressure on Aromanians to become linguistically dissimilated from the 18th century, when dissimilation efforts were encouraged by the Greek missionary Cosmas of Aetolia (1714–1779) who taught that Aromanians should speak Greek because as he said &quot;it&#x27;s the language of our Church&quot; and established over 100 Greek schools in northern and western Greece. The offensive of the clergy against the use of Aromanian was by no means limited to religious issues but was a tool devised in order to convince the non-Greek speakers to abandon what they regarded as a &quot;worthless&quot; idiom and adopt the superior Greek speech: &quot;There we are Metsovian brothers, together with those who are fooling themselves with this sordid and vile Aromanian language... forgive me for calling it a language&quot;, &quot;repulsive speech with a disgusting diction&quot;.

=== Ethnic Macedonian propaganda ===


The ethnic Macedonian ideology during the second half of the 19th century was at its inception. One of the first preserved accounts is an article by Petko Slaveykov, published on 18 January 1871 in the &quot;Macedonia&quot; newspaper in Constantinople. In this article Petko Slaveykov writes: &quot;We have many times heard from the Macedonists that they are not Bulgarians, but they are rather Macedonians, descendants of the Ancient Macedonians&quot;. In a letter written to the Bulgarian Exarch in February 1874 Petko Slaveykov reports that discontentment with the current situation &quot;has given birth among local patriots to the disastrous idea of working independently on the advancement of their own local dialect and what’s more, of their own, separate Macedonian church leadership.&quot;

In 1875 Gjorgjija Pulevski published in Belgrade a book called &quot;Dictionary of Three Languages&quot; (&quot;Rečnik od tri jezika&quot;). The text of the &quot;Rečnik&quot; contains programmatic statements where Pulevski argues for an independent Slavic Macedonian nation and language. It was the first work that publicly claimed Macedonian to be a separate language. In 1880 he published &quot;Slognica Rechovska&quot; in Sofia as an attempt at a grammar of the language of the Slavs who lived in Macedonia. Although he had no formal education, Pulevski published several other books, including three dictionaries and a collection of songs from Macedonia, customs, and holidays.

The first significant manifestation of ethnic Macedonian nationalism was the book On Macedonian Matters (&quot;Za Makedonskite Raboti&quot;) published in Sofia in 1903 by Krste Misirkov. In the book Misirkov advocated that the Slavs of Macedonia should take a separate way from the Bulgarians and the Bulgarian language. Misirkov considered that the term &quot;Macedonian&quot; should be used to define the whole Slavic population of Macedonia, obliterating the existing division between Greeks, Bulgarians and Serbians. The adoption of a separate &quot;Macedonian language&quot; was also advocated as a means of unification of the Ethnic Macedonians with Serbian, Bulgarian and Greek consciousness. &quot;On Macedonian Matters&quot; was written in the South Slavic dialect spoken in central Macedonia (Veles-Prilep-Bitola-Ohrid). This dialect was proposed by Misirkov as the basis for the future language, and, as Misirkov says, a dialect which is most different from all other neighboring languages (as the eastern dialect was too close to Bulgarian and the northern one too close to Serbian). Misirkov calls this language Macedonian.

While Misirkov talked about the Macedonian consciousness and the Macedonian language as a future goal, he described the wider region of Macedonia in the early 20th century as inhabited by Bulgarians, Greeks, Serbs, Turks, Albanians, Aromanians, and Jews. As regards to the ethnic Macedonians themselves, Misirkov maintained that they had called themselves Bulgarians until the publication of the book and were always called Bulgarians by independent observers until 1878 when the Serbian views also started to get recognition. He also explained that the reason for that was because local Slavs were allies with the Bulgars in the wars against Byzantine Empire and because of that Byzantine Greeks renamed them into &quot;Bulgarians&quot;, in that way the term became a identification for Macedonian Slavs in the future. Misirkov rejected the ideas in &quot;On Macedonian Matters&quot; later and turned into a staunch advocate of the Bulgarian cause. He returned to the ethnic Macedonian idea again in the 1920s.
Another prominent activist for the ethnic Macedonian national revival was Dimitrija Čupovski, who was one of the founders and the president of the Macedonian Literary Society established in Saint Petersburg in 1902. During the 1913–14 period, Čupovski published the newspaper &quot;Makedonski Golos&quot;&#x27; (Македонскi Голосъ) (meaning &quot;Macedonian voice&quot;) in which he and fellow members of the Petersburg Macedonian Colony propagandized the existence of a separate Macedonian people different from Greeks, Bulgarians and Serbs, and were struggling for popularizing the idea for an independent Macedonian state.

During the 1920s and 30s the idea was promoted by some of the leftist members of the Macedonian Federative Organization and later IMRO (United) and also by some members of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. In 1934 the Comintern in coordination with IMRO (United) published a resolution on the Macedonian question in which for the first time, an authoritative international organization has recognized the existence of a separate Macedonian nation and Macedonian language.

The ideas of Misirkov, Pulevski and other Macedonians would remain largely unnoticed until World War II when they were adopted by the Macedonian Partisans movement which in 1944 set up the Anti-fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia and proclaimed a Macedonian nation-state of ethnic Macedonians. They made Macedonian the official language of the Macedonian state further influencing its codification in 1945. The state was later incorporated in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
The present-day historians from North Macedonia claim that IMRO was split into two factions: the first aimed an ethnic Macedonian state, and the second believed in a Macedonia as a part of wider Bulgarian entity. 
These claims of present-day historians from North Macedonia that the &quot;Autonomists&quot; in IMRO who defended a Macedonian position are largely ungrounded. IMRO regarded itself – and was regarded by the Ottoman authorities, the Greek guerilla groups, the contemporary press in Europe and even by Misirkov -as an exclusively Bulgarian organization.

=== Romanian propaganda ===
Romanian influence in the area made some success in Bitola, Kruševo, and in the Aromanian villages in the districts of Bitola and Ohrid. Most Aromanians regard and regarded themselves as a separate ethnic group, and Romanians view such nations as subgroups of a wider Romanian ethnicity. Some Aromanians do identify as part of the Romanian nation however. Currently, among anti-Romanian groups of Aromanians, particularly in Greece, these acts are referred to as &quot;the Romanian propaganda&quot;.

=== Development of the name &quot;Macedonian Slavs&quot; ===


The name &quot;Macedonian Slavs&quot; started to appear in publications at the end of the 1880s and the beginning of the 1890s. Though the successes of the Serbian propaganda effort had proved that the Slavic population of Macedonia was not only Bulgarian, they still failed to convince that this population was, in fact, Serbian. Rarely used until the end of the 19th century compared to &#x27;Bulgarians&#x27;, the term &#x27;Macedonian Slavs&#x27; served more to conceal rather than define the national character of the population of Macedonia. Scholars resorted to it usually as a result of Serbian pressure or used it as a general term for the Slavs inhabiting Macedonia regardless of their ethnic affinities. The Serbian politician Stojan Novaković proposed in 1887 employing the Macedonistic ideas as they means to counteract the Bulgarian influence in Macedonia, thereby promoting Serbian interests in the region.

=== Absent national consciousness ===
What stood behind the difficulties to properly define the nationality of the Slavic population of Macedonia was the apparent levity with which this population regarded it. The existence of a separate Macedonian national consciousness prior to the 1940s is disputed. This confusion is illustrated by Robert Newman in 1935, who recounts discovering in a village in Vardar Macedonia two brothers, one who considered himself a Serb, and the other considered himself a Bulgarian. In another village he met a man who had been, &quot;a Macedonian peasant all his life&quot;, but who had varyingly been called a Turk, a Serb and a Bulgarian. However anti-Serb and pro-Bulgarian feelings among the local population at this period prevailed.

=== Statistical data ===
====Ottoman statistics====
The basis of the Ottoman censuses was the millet system. People were assigned to ethnic categories according to religious affiliation. So all Sunni Muslims were categorised as Turks, all members of Greek Orthodox church as Greeks, while rest being divided between Bulgarian and Serb Orthodox churches. All censuses concluded that the province is of Christian majority, among whom the Bulgarians prevail.

1882 Ottoman census in Macedonia:
1895 census:
Special survey in 1904 of Hilmi Pasha of the three Macedonian vilayets of Selanik, Manastir and Kosovo (648 thousand followes of the Ecumenical Patriarchate and 557 thousand faithful of the Bulgarian Exarchate, but an additional 250 thousand of the former) had identified as Bulgarian speakers. The survey also extends to parts of the three vilayets which are not part of the region of Macedonia, i.e., Sandžak, Kosovo, parts of eastern Albania and Epirus. 
Census 1906:

====Rival statistical data====
====&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;====
The 1911 edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; gave the following statistical estimates about the population of Macedonia:
*Slavs (described in the encyclopaedia as a &quot;Slavonic population, the bulk of which is regarded by almost all independent sources as Bulgarians&quot;): approximately 1,150,000, whereof, 1,000,000 Orthodox and 150,000 Muslims (called Pomaks)
*Turks: ca. 500,000 (Muslims)
*Greeks: ca. 250,000, whereof ca. 240,000 Orthodox and 14,000 Muslims
*Albanians: ca. 120,000, whereof 10,000 Orthodox and 110,000 Muslims
*Vlachs: ca. 90,000 Orthodox and 3,000 Muslims
*Jews: ca. 75,000
*Roma: ca. 50,000, whereof 35,000 Orthodox and 15,000 Muslims

In total 1,300,000 Christians (almost exclusively Orthodox), 800,000 Muslims, 75,000 Jews, a total population of ca. 2,200,000 for the whole of Macedonia.

It needs to be taken into account that part of the Slavic-speaking population in southern Macedonia regarded itself as ethnically Greek and a smaller percentage, mostly in northern Macedonia, as Serbian. All Muslims (except the Albanians) tended to view themselves and were viewed as Turks, irrespective of their mother tongue.

====Statistical data of Greek Macedonia====
According to a League of Nations report in 1912, Greek Macedonia&#x27;s national makeup in 1913 was 42.6% Greek (513,000), 39.4% Muslim (475,000; including &quot;Vallahades&quot;), 9.9% Bulgarian (119,000) and 8.1% others (98,000). According to a Carnegie survey based on the ethnographic map of Southern Macedonia, representing the ethnic distribution on the eve of the 1912 Balkan war, published in 1913 by Mr. J. Ivanov, lecturer at the University of Sofia. The total numbers belonging to the various nationalities in a territory a little larger than the portion in the same region ceded to the Greeks by the Turks was 1,042,029 inhabitants, of whom 329,371 Bulgarians, 314,854 Turks, 236,755 Greeks, 68,206 Jews, 44,414 Wallachians, 25,302 Gypsies, 15,108 Albanians, 8,019 Miscellaneous.

According to a later League of Nations report, at the 1928 census the population consisted of 1,341,000 Greeks (88.8%), 77,000 Bulgarians (5%), 2,000 Turks and 91,000 others, but according to Greek archival sources the total number of the Slavic speakers may have been 200,000.

==20th and 21st centuries==
The Balkan Wars (1912–1913) and World War I (1914–1918) left the region of Macedonia divided among Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Albania and resulted in significant changes in its ethnic composition. 51% of the region&#x27;s territory went to Greece, 38% to Serbia and 10% to Bulgaria. At least several hundred thousand left their homes, while the rest were also subjected to assimilation as all &quot;liberators&quot; after the Balkan War wanted to assimilate as many inhabitants as possible and colonize with settlers from their respective nation. The Greeks become the largest population in the region. The formerly leading Muslim and Bulgarian communities were reduced either by deportation (through population exchange) or by change of identity.

=== Greece ===
The Slavic population was viewed as Slavophone Greeks and prepared to be reeducated in Greek. Any vestiges of Bulgarian and Slavic Macedonia in Greece have been eliminated from the Balkan Wars, continuing to the present. The Greeks detested the Bulgarians (Slavs of Macedonia), considering them less than human &quot;bears, practising systematic and inhumane methods of extermination and assimilation. The use of Bulgarian language had been prohibited, for which the persecution by the police peaked, while during the regime of Metaxas a vigorous assimilation campaign was launched. The civilians have been persecuted solely for identifying as Bulgarian with the slogans &quot;If you want to be free, be Greek&quot; &quot;We shall cut your tongues to teach you to speak Greek.&quot; &quot;become Greeks again, that being the condition of a peaceful life.&quot;&quot;Are you Christians or Bulgarians?&quot; &quot;The voice of Alexander the Great calls to you from the tomb; do you not hear it? You sleep on and go on calling yourselves Bulgarians!&quot; &quot;Wast thou born at Sofia; there are no Bulgarians in Macedonia; the whole population is Greek.&quot; &quot;He who goes to live in Bulgaria,&quot; was the reply to the protests, &quot;is Bulgarian. No more Bulgarians in Greek Macedonia.&quot; The remaining Bulgarians threatened by use of force were made to become Greeks and to sign a declaration stating that they had been Greek since ancient times, but by the influence of komitadji they became Bulgarians only fifteen years ago, but nevertheless there was no real change in consciousness. 
In many villages people were put to prison and then were released after having proclaimed themselves Greeks. The Slavic dialect was considered as being of lowest intelligence with the assumptions that it &quot;consists&quot; only a thousand words of vocabulary. There are official records showing that children professing Bulgarian identity were also murdered for declining to profess Greek identity.

After the Treaty of Bucharest, some 51% of the &quot;modern&quot; region that was known as Macedonia was won by the Greek state (also known as Aegean or Greek Macedonia). This was the only part of Macedonia that Greece was directly interested in. Greeks regarded this land as the only true region of Macedonia as it geographically corresponded to ancient Macedon and contained an ethnically Greek majority of population. Bulgarian and other non-Greek schools in southern (Greek) Macedonia were closed and Bulgarian teachers and priests were deported as early as the First Balkan War simultaneous to deportation of Greeks from Bulgaria. The bulk of the Slavic population of southeastern Macedonia fled to Bulgaria during the Second Balkan War or was resettled there in the 1920s by virtue of a population exchange agreement. The Slavic minority in Greek Macedonia, who were referred to by the Greek authorities as &quot;Slavomacedonians&quot;, &quot;Slavophone Greeks&quot; and &quot;Bulgarisants&quot;, were subjected to a gradual assimilation by the Greek majority. Their numbers were reduced by a large-scale emigration to North America in the 1920s and the 1930s and to Eastern Europe and Yugoslavia following the Greek Civil War (1944–1949). At the same time a number of Macedonian Greeks from Monastiri (modern Bitola) entered Greece.

The 1923 Compulsory population exchange between Greece and Turkey led to a radical change in the ethnic composition of Greek Macedonia. Some 380,000 Turks and other Muslims left the region and were replaced by 538,253 Greeks from Asia Minor and Eastern Thrace, including Pontic Greeks from northeastern Anatolia and Caucasus Greeks from the South Caucasus.

Greece was attacked and occupied by Nazi-led Axis during World War II. By the beginning of 1941 the whole of Greece was under a tripartite German, Italian and Bulgarian occupation. The Bulgarians were permitted to occupy western Thrace and parts of Greek Macedonia, where they persecuted and committed massacres and other atrocities against the Greek population. The once thriving Jewish community of Thessaloniki was decimated by the Nazis, who deported 60,000 of the city&#x27;s Jews to the German death camps in Germany and German-occupied Poland. Large Jewish populations in the Bulgarian occupied zone were deported by the Bulgarian army and had an equal death rate to the German zone.

The Bulgarian Army occupied the whole of Eastern Macedonia and Western Thrace, where it was greeted from a part of a Slav-speakers as liberators. Unlike Germany and Italy, Bulgaria officially annexed the occupied territories, which had long been a target of Bulgarian irridentism. A massive campaign of &quot;Bulgarisation&quot; was launched, which saw all Greek officials deported. This campaign was successful especially in Eastern and later in Central Macedonia, when Bulgarians entered the area in 1943. All Slav-speakers there were regarded as Bulgarians. However it was not so effective in German-occupied Western Macedonia. A ban was placed on the use of the Greek language, the names of towns and places changed to the forms traditional in Bulgarian.

With the help of Bulgarian officers several pro-Bulgarian and anti-Greek armed detachments (Ohrana) were organized in the Kastoria, Florina and Edessa districts of occupied Greek Macedonia in 1943. These were led by Bulgarian officers originally from Greek Macedonia; Andon Kalchev and Georgi Dimchev. Ohrana (meaning Defense) was an autonomist pro-Bulgarian organization fighting for unification with Greater Bulgaria. Uhrana was supported from IMRO leader Ivan Mihaylov too. It was apparent that Mihailov had broader plans which envisaged the creation of a Macedonian state under a German control. It was also anticipated that the IMRO volunteers would form the core of the armed forces of a future Independent Macedonia in addition to providing administration and education in the Florina, Kastoria and Edessa districts. In the summer of 1944, Ohrana constituted some 12,000 fighters and volunteers from Bulgaria charged with protection of the local population. During 1944, whole Slavophone villages were armed by the occupation authorities and developed into the most formidable enemy of the Greek People&#x27;s Liberation Army (ELAS). Ohrana was dissolved in late 1944 after the German and Bulgarian withdrawal from Greece and Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Partisans movement hardly concealed its intention of expanding. After World War II, many former &quot;Ohranists&quot; were convicted of a military crimes as collaborationists. It was from this period, after Bulgaria&#x27;s conversion to communism, that some Slav-speakers in Greece who had referred to themselves as &quot;Bulgarians&quot; increasingly began to identify as &quot;Macedonians&quot;.

Following the defeat of the Axis powers and the evacuation of the Nazi occupation forces many members of the Ohrana joined the SNOF where they could still pursue their goal of secession. The advance of the Red Army into Bulgaria in September 1944, the withdrawal of the German armed forces from Greece in October, meant that the Bulgarian Army had to withdraw from Greek Macedonia and Thrace. A large proportion of Bulgarians and Slavic speakers emigrated there. In 1944 the declarations of Bulgarian nationality were estimated by the Greek authorities, on the basis of monthly returns, to have reached 16,000 in the districts of German-occupied Greek Macedonia, but according to British sources, declarations of Bulgarian nationality throughout Western Macedonia reached 23,000.

By 1945 World War II had ended and Greece was in open civil war. It has been estimated that after the end of World War II over 40,000 people fled from Greece to Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. To an extent the collaboration of the peasants with the Germans, Italians, Bulgarians or the Greek People&#x27;s Liberation Army (ELAS) was determined by the geopolitical position of each village. Depending upon whether their village was vulnerable to attack by the Greek communist guerrillas or the occupation forces, the peasants would opt to support the side in relation to which they were most vulnerable. In both cases, the attempt was to promise &quot;freedom&quot; (autonomy or independence) to the formerly persecuted Slavic minority as a means of gaining its support.

The National Liberation Front (NOF) was organized by the political and military groups of the Slavic minority in Greece, active from 1945 to 1949. The interbellum was the time when part of them came to the conclusion that they are Macedonians. Greek hostility to the Slavic minority produced tensions that rose to separatism. After the recognition in 1934 from the Comintern of the Macedonian ethnicity, the Greek communists have also recognized Macedonian national identity. Soon after the first &quot;free territories&quot; were created it was decided that ethnic Macedonian schools would open in the area controlled by the DSE. Books written in the ethnic Macedonian language were published, while ethnic Macedonians theatres and cultural organizations operated. Also within the NOF, a female organization, the Women&#x27;s Antifascist Front (AFZH), and a youth organization, the National Liberation Front of Youth (ONOM), were formed.

The creation of the ethnic Macedonian cultural institutions in the Democratic Army of Greece (DSE)-held territory, newspapers and books published by NOF, public speeches and the schools opened, helped the consolidation of the ethnic Macedonian conscience and identity among the population. According to information announced by Paskal Mitrovski on the I plenum of NOF in August 1948 – about 85% of the Slavic-speaking population in Greek Macedonia has ethnic Macedonian self-identity. The language that was thought in the schools was the official language of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. About 20,000 young ethnic Macedonians learned to read and write using that language, and learned their own history.

From 1946 until the end of the Civil War in 1949, the NOF was loyal to Greece and was fighting for minimal human rights within the borders of a Greek republic. But in order to mobilize more ethnic Macedonians into the DSE it was declared on 31 January 1949 at the 5th Meeting of the KKE Central Committee that when the DSE took power in Greece there would be an independent Macedonian state, united in its geographical borders. This new line of the KKE affected the mobilisation rate of ethnic Macedonians (which even earlier was considerably high), but did not manage, ultimately, to change the course of the war.

The government forces destroyed every village that was on their way, and expelled the civilian population. Leaving as a result of force or on their own accord (in order to escape oppression and retaliation), 50,000 people left Greece together with the retreating DSE forces. All of them were sent to Eastern Bloc countries. It was not until the 1970s that some of them were allowed to come to the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. In the 1980s, the Greek parliament adopted the law of national reconciliation which allowed DSE members &quot;of Greek origin&quot; to repatriate to Greece, where they were given land. Ethnic Macedonian DSE remembers remained excluded from the terms of this legislation.

On August 20, 2003, the Rainbow Party hosted a reception for the &quot;child refugees&quot;, ethnic Macedonian children who fled their homes during the Greek Civil War who were permitted to enter Greece for a maximum of 20 days. Now elderly, this was the first time many of them saw their birthplaces and families in some 55 years. The reception included relatives of the refugees who are living in Greece and are members of Rainbow Party. However, many were refused entry by Greek border authorities because their passports listed the former names of their places of birth.

The present number of the &quot;Slavophones&quot; in Greece has been subject to much speculation with varying numbers. As Greece does not hold census based on self-determination and mother tongue, no official data is available. It should be noted, however, that the official Macedonian Slav party in Greece receives at an average only 1000 votes. For more information about the region and its population see Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia.

=== Serbia and Yugoslavia ===
After the Balkan Wars (1912–1913) the Slavs in Vardar Macedonia were regarded as southern Serbs and the language they spoke a southern Serbian dialect. Serbian rule ensured that all ethnic Macedonian symbolism and identity were henceforth proscribed, and only standard Serbian was permitted to be spoken by the locals of Macedonia. In addition, Serbia did not refer to its southern land as &quot;Macedonia&quot;, a legacy which remains in place today among some Serbian nationalists (e.g. the Serbian Radical Party). Despite their attempts of forceful assimilation, Serb colonists in Vardar Macedonia numbered only 100,000 by 1942, so there was not that colonization and expulsion as in Greek Macedonia. Ethnic cleansing was unlikely in Serbia, Bulgarians were given to sign declaration for being Serbs since ancient times, those who refused to sign faced assimilation through terror, while Muslims faced similar discrimination. However, in 1913 Bulgarian revolts broke out in Tikvesh, Negotino, Kavadarci, Vartash, Ohrid, Debar and Struga, and more than 260 villages were burnt down. Serbian officials are documented to have buried alive three Bulgarian civilians from Pehčevo then. Bulgarians were forced to sign a petition &quot;Declare yourself a Serb or die.&quot; 90,000 Serbian troops were deployed in Macedonia to keep down resistance from Serbianization, Serbian colonists were unsuccessfully encouraged to immigrate with the slogan &quot;for the good of Serbs&quot;, but the Albanians and Turks to emigrate. In the next centuries, a sense of a distinct Macedonian nation emerged partly as a result of the resistance of IMRO, despite it was split into one Macedonist and one pro-Bulgarian wing. In 1918 the use of Bulgarian and Macedonian language was prohibited in Serbian Macedonia.

The Bulgarian, Greek and Romanian schools were closed, the Bulgarian priests and all non-Serbian teachers were expelled. Bulgarian surname endings &#x27;-ov/-ev&#x27; were replaced with the typically Serbian ending &#x27;-ich&#x27; and the population which considered itself Bulgarian was heavily persecuted. The policy of Serbianization in the 1920s and 1930s clashed with popular pro-Bulgarian sentiment stirred by IMRO detachments infiltrating from Bulgaria, whereas local communists favoured the path of self-determination suggested by the Yugoslav Communist Party in the 1924 May Manifesto.

In 1925, D. J. Footman, the British vice consul at Skopje, addressed a lengthy report for the Foreign Office. He wrote that &quot;the majority of the inhabitants of &quot;Southern Serbia&quot; are Orthodox Christian Macedonians, ethnologically more akin to the Bulgarians than to the Serbs.&quot; He acknowledged that the Macedonians were better disposed toward Bulgaria because, Bulgarian education system in Macedonia in the time of the Turks, was widespread and effective; and because Macedonians at the time perceived Bulgarian culture and prestige to be higher than those of its neighbors. Moreover, large numbers of Macedonians educated in Bulgarian schools had sought refuge in Bulgaria before and especially after the partitions of 1913. &quot;There is therefore now a large Macedonian element in Bulgaria, continued represented in all Government Departments and occupying high positions in the army and in the civil service...&quot; He characterized this element as &quot;Serbophobe, [it] mostly desires the incorporation of Macedonia in Bulgaria, and generally supports the IMRO.&quot; However, he also pointed to the existence of the tendency to seek an independent Macedonia with Salonica as its capital. &quot;This movement also had adherents among the Macedonian colony in Bulgaria.&quot;

Bulgarian troops were welcomed as liberators in 1941 but mistakes of the Bulgarian administration made a growing number of people resent their presence by 1944. It must also to be noted that the Bulgarian army during the annexation of the region, was partially recruited from the local population, which formed as much as 40%-60% of the soldiers in certain battalions. Some recent data has announced that even the National Liberation War of Macedonia has resembled ethno-political motivated civil war. After the war the region received the status of a constituent republic within Yugoslavia and in 1945 a separate, Macedonian language was codified. The population was declared Macedonian, a nationality different from both Serbs and Bulgarians. The decision was politically motivated and aimed at weakening the position of Serbia within Yugoslavia and of Bulgaria with regard to Yugoslavia. Surnames were again changed to include the ending &#x27;-ski&#x27;, which was to emphasise the unique nature of the ethnic Macedonian population.

From the start of the new Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY), accusations surfaced that new authorities in Macedonia were involved in retribution against people who did not support the formation of the new Yugoslav Macedonian republic. The numbers of dead &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot; due to organized killings, however is unclear. Besides, many people went throughout the Labor camp of Goli Otok in the middle 1940s. This chapter of the partisan&#x27;s history was a taboo subject for conversation in the SFRY until the late 1980s, and as a result, decades of official silence created a reaction in the form of numerous data manipulations for nationalist communist propaganda purposes.
At the times of Croatian ruling-class of Yugoslavia, Vardar Banovina Province was turned into autonomous Macedonia with a majority of the population declaring on census as ethnic Macedonians, and a Macedonian language as the official, recognized as distinct from Serbo-Croatian. The capital was placed in a Torlakian-speaking region. Persecution of Bulgarian identity by the state continued, along with propaganda.

After the creation of Macedonian Republic the Presidium of ASNOM which was the highest political organ in Macedonia made several statements and actions that were de facto boycotting the decisions of AVNOJ. Instead of obeying the order of Tito&#x27;s General Headquarters to send the main forces of the NOV of Macedonia to participate in the fighting in the Srem area for the final liberation of Yugoslavia, the cadre close to President Metodija Andonov – Cento gave serious thoughts whether it is better to order the preparation for an advance of the 100.000 armed men under his command toward northern Greece in order to &quot;unify the Macedonian people&quot; into one country. Officers loyal to Chento&#x27;s ideas made a mutiny in the garrison stationed on Skopje&#x27;s fortress, but the mutiny was suppressed by armed intervention. A dozen officers were shot on place, others sentenced to life imprisonment. Also Chento and his close associates were trying to minimize the ties with Yugoslavia as far as possible and were constantly mentioning the unification of the Macedonian people into one state, which was against the decisions of AVNOJ. Chento was even talking about the possibility to create an independent Macedonia backed by the US. The Yugoslav secret police made a decisive action and managed to arrest Metodija Andonov - Chento and his closest men and prevent his policies. Chento&#x27;s place was taken by Lazar Kolishevski, who started fully implementing the pro-Yugoslav line.

Later the authorities organised frequent purges and trials of Macedonian people charged with autonomist deviation. Many of the former IMRO (United) government officials, were purged from their positions then isolated, arrested, imprisoned or executed on various (in many cases fabricated) charges including: pro-Bulgarian leanings, demands for greater or complete independence of Yugoslav Macedonia, forming of conspirative political groups or organisations, demands for greater democracy, etc. People as Panko Brashnarov, Pavel Shatev, Dimitar Vlahov and Venko Markovski were quickly ousted from the new government, and some of them assassinated. On the other hand, former IMRO-members, followers of Ivan Mihailov, were also persecuted by the Belgrade-controlled authorities on accusations of collaboration with the Bulgarian occupation. Metodi Shatorov&#x27;s supporters in Vardar Macedonia, called &quot;Sharlisti&quot;, were systematically exterminated by the Yugoslav Communist Party (YCP) in the autumn of 1944, and repressed for their anti-Yugoslav and pro-Bulgarian political positions.

The encouragement and evolution of the culture of the Republic of Macedonia has had a far greater and more permanent impact on Macedonian nationalism than has any other aspect of Yugoslav policy. While development of national music, films and the graphic arts has been encouraged in the Republic of Macedonia, the greatest cultural effect has come from the codification of the Macedonian language and literature, the new Macedonian national interpretation of history and the establishment of a Macedonian Orthodox Church in 1967 by Central Committee of the Communist Party of Macedonia.

=== Bulgaria ===
The Bulgarian population in Pirin Macedonia remained Bulgarian after 1913. The &quot;Macedonian question&quot; became especially prominent after the Balkan wars in 1912–1913, followed from the withdraw of the Ottoman Empire and the subsequent division of the region of Macedonia between Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia. The Slav – speakers in Macedonia tended to be Christian peasants, but the majority of them were under the influence of the Bulgarian Exarchate and its education system, thus considered themselves as Bulgarians. Moreover, Bulgarians in Bulgaria believed that most of the population of Macedonia was Bulgarian. Before the Balkan Wars the regional Macedonian dialects were treated as Bulgarian and the Exarchate school system taught the locals in Bulgarian. Following the Balkan wars the Bulgarian Exarchate activity in most of the region was discontinued. After World War I, the territory of the present-day North Macedonia came under the direct rule of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and was sometimes termed &quot;Southern Serbia&quot;. Together with a portion of today&#x27;s Serbia, it belonged officially to the newly formed Vardar Banovina. An intense program of Serbianization was implemented during the 1920s and 1930s when Belgrade enforced a Serbian cultural assimilation process on the region. Between the two world wars in Vardar Banovina, the regional Macedonian dialects were declared as Serbian and the Serbian language was introduced in the schools and administration as official language. There was implemented a governmental policy of assassinations and assimilation. The Serbian administration in Vardar Banovina felt insecure and that provoked its brutal reprisals on the local peasant population.
Greece, like all other Balkan states, adopted restrictive policies towards its minorities, namely towards its Slavic population in its northern regions, due to its experiences with Bulgaria&#x27;s wars, including the Second Balkan War, and the Bulgarian inclination of sections of its Slavic minority.
The movement of the Bulgarian army in Yugoslavia started on April 19, and in Greece on April 20. The prominent force which occupied most of Vardar Macedonia, was the Bulgarian 5th Army. The 6th and 7th Infantry Divisions were active in invading the Vardar Banovina between 19 and 24 April 1941. The Bulgarian troops were mainly present in the western part of Vardar Macedonia, close to the Italian occupational zone, because of some border clashes with Italians, who implemented Albanian interests and terrorized the local peasants. So the most of Vardar Banovina, (including Vardar Macedonia), was annexed by Bulgaria and along with various other regions became Greater Bulgaria. The westernmost parts of Vardar Macedonia was occupied by the fascist Kingdom of Italy. As the Bulgarian Army entered Vardar Macedonia on 19 April 1941, it was greeted by the local population as liberators as it meant the end of Serbian rule. Former IMRO and IMRO (United) members were active in organizing Bulgarian Action Committees charged with taking over the local authorities. Bulgarian Action Committees propagated a proclamation to the Bulgarians in North Macedonia on occasion of the invasion of the Bulgarian Army in the Vardar Banovina. As regards the Serbian colonists, the members of the campaign committees were adamant—they had to be deported as soon as possible and their properties to be returned to the locals. With the arrival of the Bulgarian army mass expulsion of Serbs from the area of the Vardar Macedonia took place. First, the city dwellers were deported in 1941, then all of the suspected pro-Serbs. Metodi Shatarov-Šarlo, who was a local leader of the Yugoslav Communist Party, also refused to define the Bulgarian forces as occupiers (contrary to instructions from Belgrade) and called for the incorporation of the local Macedonian Communist organizations within the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP). The Macedonian Regional Committee refused to remain in contact with Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY) and linked up with BCP as soon as the invasion of Yugoslavia started. The CPY formally decided to launch an armed uprising on 4 July 1941 but Šarlo refused to distribute the proclamation of calling for military actions against Bulgarians. More than 12,000 Yugoslav Macedonian prisoners of war (POWs) who had been conscripted into the Yugoslav army were released by a German, Italian and Hungarian Armies. The Slav-speakers in the part of Greek Macedonia occupied by the Bulgarian Army also greeted it as liberation.

Before the German invasion in the Soviet Union, there had not been any resistance in Vardar Banovina. At the start of World War II, the Comintern supported a policy of non-intervention, arguing that the war was an imperialist war between various national ruling classes, but when the Soviet Union itself was invaded on 22 June 1941, the Comintern changed its position. The German attack on the Soviet Union sparked the rage of the Communists in Bulgaria. The same day the BCP spread a brochure among the people urging &quot;To hinder by all means the usage of Bulgarian land and soldiers for the criminal purposes of German fascism&quot;. Two days later, on 24 June, the BCP called for an armed resistance against the Wehrmacht and the Bogdan Filov government. After that, and when already months ago Yugoslavia was annexed by Axis Powers, Macedonian Communist partisans, which included Macedonians, Aromanians, Serbs, Albanians, Jews and Bulgarians had begun organizing their resistance. The First Skopje Partisan Detachment was founded and had been attacked Axis soldiers on 8 September 1941 in Bogomila, near Skopje. The revolt on 11 October 1941 by the Prilep Partisan Detachment is considered to be the symbolic beginning of the resistance. Armed insurgents from the Prilep Partisan Detachment attacked Axis occupied zones in the city of Prilep, notably a police station, killing one Bulgarian policeman of local origin, which led to attacks in Kruševo and to the creation of small rebel detachments in other regions of North Macedonia. Partisan detachments were formed also in Greek Macedonia and today&#x27;s Bulgarian Macedonia under the leadership of Communist Party of Greece and Bulgarian Communist Party.

In April 1942 a map titled &quot;The Danube area&quot; was published in Germany, where the so-called &quot;new annexed territories&quot; of Bulgaria in Vardar and Greek Macedonia and Western Thrace were described as &quot;territories under temporary Bulgarian administration&quot;. This was a failure for Sofia&#x27;s official propaganda, which claimed to have completed the National unification of the Bulgarians and showed the internal contradiction among Italy, Bulgaria and Germany. With the ongoing war, new anti-fascist partisan units were constantly formed and in 1942 a total of nine small partisan detachments were active in Vardar Macedonia and had maintained control of mountainous territories around Prilep, Skopje, Kruševo and Veles. The clash between the Yugoslav and Bulgarian Communists about possession over North Macedonia was not ended. While the Bulgarian Communists avoided organizing mass armed uprising against the Bulgarian authorities, the Yugoslav Communists insisted that no liberation could be achieved without an armed revolt. With the help of the Comintern and of Joseph Stalin himself a decision was taken and the Macedonian Communists were attached to CPY. Because of the unwillingness of local Communists for earnest struggle against the Bulgarian Army, the Supreme Staff of CPY took measurements for strengthening of the campaign.

Otherwise the policy of minimal resistance changed towards 1943 with the arrival of the Montenegrin Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo, who began to organize an energetic struggle against the Bulgarian occupants. Tempo served on the Supreme Staff of CPY and became Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s personal representative in the Vardar Banovina.
Meanwhile, the Bulgarian government was responsible for the round-up and deportation of over 7,000 Jews in Skopje and Bitola. It refused to deport the Jews from Bulgarian proper but later under German pressure those Jews from the new annexed territories, without a Bulgarian citizenship were deported, as these from Vardar Macedonia and Western Thrace. The Bulgarian authorities created a special Gendarmerie forces which received almost unlimited power to pursue the Communist partisans on the whole territory of the kingdom. The gendarmes became notorious for carrying out atrocities against captured partisans and their supporters. Harsh rule by the occupying forces and a number of Allied victories indicated that the Axis might lose the war and that encouraged more Macedonians to support the communist Partisan resistance movement of Josip Broz Tito.

Many former IMRO members assisted the Bulgarian authorities in fighting Tempo&#x27;s partisans. With the help of Bulgarian government and former IMRO members, several pro-Bulgarian and anti-Greek detachments – Uhrana were organized in occupied Greek Macedonia in 1943. These were led by Bulgarian officers originally from Greek Macedonia and served for protection of the local population in the zone under German and Italian control. After the capitulation of Fascist Italy in September 1943, the Italian zone in Macedonia was taken over by the Germans. Uhrana was supported from Ivan Mihailov. It was apparent that Mihailov had broader plans which envisaged the creation of a Macedonian state under a German control. He was follower of the idea about a United Macedonian state with prevailing Bulgarian element. It was also anticipated that the IMRO volunteers would form the core of the armed forces of a future Independent Macedonia in addition to providing administration and education in the Florina, Kastoria and Edessa districts.

Then in the resistance movement in Vardar Macedonia were clearly visible two political tendencies. The first one was represented by Tempo and the newly established Macedonian Communist Party, gave priority to battling against any form of manifest or latent pro-Bulgarian sentiment and to bringing the region into the new projected Communist Yugoslav Federation. Veterans of the pro-Bulgarian IMRO and IMRO (United) who had accepted the solution of the Macedonian question as an ethnic preference, now regarded the main objective as being the unification of Macedonia into a single state, whose postwar future was to involve not necessarily inclusion in a Yugoslav federation. They foresaw in it a new form of Serbian dominance over North Macedonia, and prefer rather membership of a Balkan federation or else independence. These two tendencies would have struck in the next few years. In Spring of 1944 the Macedonian National Liberation Army launched an operation called &quot;The Spring Offensive&quot; engaging German and Bulgarian Armies, which had over 60,000 military and administrative personnel in the area. In Strumica, approximately 3,800 fighters took part in the formation of military movements of the region; The 4th, 14th and 20th Macedonian Action Brigades, the Strumica Partisan Detachment and the 50th and 51st Macedonian Divisions were formed. Since the formation of an army in 1943, Macedonian Communist partisans were aspiring to create an autonomous government.

On 2 August 1944, on the 41st anniversary of the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising, the first session of the newly created Anti-Fascist Assembly of the National Liberation of Macedonia (ASNOM) was held at the St. Prohor Pčinjski monastery. А manifesto was written outlining the future plans of ASNOM for an independent Macedonian state and for creation of the Macedonian language as the official language of the Macedonian state. However, a decision was later reached that Vardar Macedonia will become a part of new Communist Yugoslavia. In the summer of 1944, Ohrana constituted some 12,000 fighters and volunteers from Bulgaria. Whole Slavophone villages were armed and developed into the most formidable enemy of the Greek People&#x27;s Liberation Army (ELAS). At this time Ivan Mihailov arrived in German-occupied Skopje, where the Germans hoped that he could form an Independent State of Macedonia with their support on the base of IMRO and Ohrana. Seeing that the war is lost to Germany and to avoid further bloodshed, he refused.

At this time the new Bulgarian government of Ivan Bagryanov began secret negotiations with the Allies aiming to find separate peace with repudiating any alliance with Nazi Germany and declaring neutrality, ending all anti-Jewish laws and ordering the withdrawal of the Bulgarian troops from Macedonia. Through its Macedonia-born minister of Internal Affairs , the government tried to negotiate with the Macedonian partisans promising that after Bulgarian army withdrawal from Vardar Macedonia its arms would be given up to the partisans. It would be possible by condition that partisans guaranteed the establishment of pro-Bulgarian Macedonian state without the frame of future Yugoslavia. The negotiations failed and on 9 September 1944 the Fatherland Front in Sofia made a coup d&#x27;état and deposed the government. After the declaration of war by Bulgaria on Nazi Germany, the withdrawing Bulgarian troops in Macedonia surrounded by German forces, fought their way back to the old borders of Bulgaria. Under the leadership of a new Bulgarian pro-Communist government, three Bulgarian armies, 455,000 strong in total, entered occupied Yugoslavia in late September 1944 and moved from Sofia to Niš and Skopje with the strategic task of blocking the German forces withdrawing from Greece. They operated here in interaction with local partisans. Southern and eastern Serbia and most of Vardar Macedonia were liberated within an end of November. Toward the end of November and during early December, the main Bulgarian forces were assembled in liberated Serbia prior to their return home. The 135,000-strong Bulgarian First Army continued to Hungary, aided by Yugoslav Partisans.

However, the Bulgarian army during the annexation of the region was partially recruited from the local population, which formed as much as 40% of the soldiers in certain battalions. Some official comments of deputies in the Macedonian parliament and of former Premier, Ljubčo Georgievski after 1991 announced the &quot;struggle was civil, but not a liberation war&quot;. According to official sources the number of Macedonian communist partisan&#x27;s victims against the Bulgarian army during World War II was 539 men. Bulgarian historian and director of the Bulgarian National Historical Museum Dr. Bozhidar Dimitrov, in his 2003 book &quot;The Ten Lies of Macedonism&quot;, has also questioned the extent of resistance of the local population of Vardar Macedonia against the Bulgarian forces and describes the clash as political.

After the end of World War II, the creation of People&#x27;s Republic of Macedonia and of a new Macedonian language, it started a process of ethnogenesis and distinct national Macedonian identity was formed. The new Yugoslav authorities began a policy of removing of any Bulgarian influence, making Macedonia connecting link for the establishment of new Balkan Federation and creating a distinct Slavic consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia. After World War II the ruling Bulgarian Communists declared the population in Bulgarian Macedonia as ethnic Macedonian and teachers were brought in from Yugoslavia to teach the locals in the new Macedonian language. The organizations of the IMRO in Bulgaria were completely destroyed. Former IMRO members were hunted by the Communist Militsiya and many of them imprisoned, repressed, exiled or killed. Also internments of disagreeing with this political activities people at the Belene labor camp were organized. Tito and Georgi Dimitrov worked about the project to merge the two Balkan countries Bulgaria and Yugoslavia into a Balkan Federative Republic according to the projects of Balkan Communist Federation. This led to the 1947 cooperation and signing of Bled Agreement. It foresaw unification between Vardar Macedonia and Pirin Macedonia and return of Western Outlands to Bulgaria. They also supported the Greek Communists and especially Slavic-Macedonian National Liberation Front in the Greek Civil War with the idea of unification of Greek Macedonia and Western Thrace to the new state under Communist rule. According this project the bourgeoisie of the ruling nations in the three imperialist states among which Macedonia was partitioned, tried to camouflage its national oppression, denying the national features of the Macedonian people and the existence of the Macedonian nation. The policies resulting from the agreement were reversed after the Tito–Stalin split in June 1948, when Bulgaria, being subordinated to the interests of the Soviet Union took a stance against Yugoslavia. This policy for projection and recognition of regional countries and nations since the 1930s as for example Macedonia, had been the norm in Comintern policies, displaying Soviet resentment of the nation-state in Eastern Europe and of the consequences of Paris Peace Conference. With the 1943 dissolution of Comintern and the subsequent advent of the Cominform in 1948 came Joseph Stalin&#x27;s dismissal of the previous ideology, and adaptation to the conditions created for Soviet hegemony during the Cold War. The Dimitrov&#x27;s sudden death in July 1949 was followed by a &quot;Titoists&quot; witchhunt in Bulgaria.

After Greek Communists lost the Greek Civil War, many Slav speakers were expelled from Greece. Although the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria originally accepted very few refugees, government policy changed and the Bulgarian government actively sought out refugees from Greek Macedonia. It is estimated that approximately 2,500 children were sent to Bulgaria and 3,000 partisans fled there in the closing period of the war. There was a larger flow into Bulgaria of refugees as the Bulgarian Army pulled out of the Drama-Serres region in 1944. A large proportion of Slavic speakers emigrated there. The &quot;Slavic Committee&quot; in Sofia () helped to attract refugees that had settled in other parts of the Eastern Bloc. According to a political report in 1962 the number of political emigrants from Greece numbered at 6,529. The policy of communist Bulgaria towards the refugees from Greece was, at least initially, not discriminative with regard to their ethnic origin: Greek- and Slav-speakers were both categorized as Greek political emigrants and received equal treatment by state authorities. However, the end of the 1950s was marked by adecisive turn in the &quot;Macedonistic&quot; policy of Bulgaria, &quot;which did not recognize anymore the existence of a Macedonian ethnicity different from the Bulgarian one&quot;. As a result, the trend to a discriminative policy, the refugees from Greece – more targeted at the Slav-speakers and less to &quot;ethnic Greeks&quot; – was given a certain proselytizing aspect. Eventually many of these migrants were assimilated into Bulgarian society.

At the end of the 1950s the Communist Party repealed its previous decision and adopted a position denying the existence of a &quot;Macedonian&quot; nation. The inconsistent Bulgarian policy has thrown most independent observers ever since into a state of confusion as to the real origin of the population in Bulgarian Macedonia. In 1960, the Bulgarian Communist Party voted a special resolution explained &quot;with the fact that almost all of the Macedonians have a &quot;clear Bulgarian national consciousness and consider Bulgaria their homeland&quot;. As result international relations upon the Sofia–Belgrade line deteriorated, and in fact were broken. This led to a final victory of the anti-Bulgarian and pro-Yugoslav oriented Macedonian political circles and signified a definite decline of the very notion of a south Slavonic federation. In Macedonia the &quot;Bulgarophobia&quot; increased almost to the level of state ideology.

Bulgaria usually kept the right to declare ethnicity at census, but Bulgarian identity was minimized in the censuses of Yugoslavia and Blagoevgrad Province of Bulgaria. but between 1945 and 1965 forcefully Macedonians Blagoecgra Province 1946 and the 1956 census the population was forced to list as ethnic Macedonians against their will by the communist government in accordance with an agreement with Yugoslavia.
A total of 3,100 people in the Blagoevgrad District declared themselves Macedonian in the 2001 census (0.9% of the population of the region). According to the European Court of Human Rights ethnic Macedonians in Bulgaria have endured violations of human rights by the Bulgarian government.

In Bulgaria today, the Macedonian question has been understood largely as a result of the violation of national integrity, beginning with the revision of the Treaty of San Stefano from 1878. Bulgaria denies the existence of a separate Macedonian identity. The Bulgarian denouncement is based on the strong sense of loss of the territory, history and language which it shared with present-day North Macedonia in the past. After the collapse of the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia and the consequent independence of the Macedonian state in 1991, Bulgaria continued to question of the legitimacy of Macedonian nationhood, yet at the same time recognised the new state. The Bulgarian government of 1991 promoted this political compromise as a constructive way of living with the national question, rather than suppressing them. Yet none of the fundamental tensions over the Macedonian question have been fully resolved, and the issue remains an important undercurrent in Sofia politics.

=== Albania ===
The South Slavic minority in Albania is concentrated in two regions, Mala Prespa and Golloborda. In the 1930s the orthodox Slavs living in Albania were regarded as Bulgarians by the local Albanian population. The new Albanian state did not attempt to assimilate this minority or to forcibly change the names of local towns and villages. During the second Balkan Conference in 1932 the Bulgarian and Albanian delegations signed a Protocol about the recognition of the ethnic Bulgarian minority in Albania. After World War II, the creation of People&#x27;s Republic of Macedonia and the policy of the new communist states about the founding of Balkan Federative Republic changed the situation and an ethnic Macedonian minority was officially recognized. Schools and radio stations in Macedonian were founded in the area.
Albania has recognised around 5,000 strong Macedonian minority. In Albania are both Bulgarian and Macedonian organizations. Each of them claims that the local Slavic population is either Bulgarian or Macedonian. The population itself, which is predominantly Muslim, has, however, preferred to call itself Albanian in official censuses.

=== North Macedonia ===

North Macedonia officially celebrates 1991 with regard to the referendum endorsing independence from Yugoslavia, albeit legalizing participation in &quot;future union of the former states of Yugoslavia&quot;. The ethnic Macedonians of North Macedonia have demonstrated without any exception a strong and even aggressive at times Macedonian consciousness. Any ties with the Bulgarians have been denounced. During this period it has been claimed by Macedonian scholars that there exist large and oppressed ethnic Macedonian minorities in the region of Macedonia, located in neighboring states. Because of those claims, irredentist proposals are being made calling for the expansion of the borders of Macedonia to encompass the territories allegedly populated with ethnic Macedonians. The population of the neighboring regions is presented as &quot;subdued&quot; to the propaganda of the governments of those neighboring countries, and in need their incorporation into a United Macedonia. By the time Macedonia proclaimed its independence those who continued to look to Bulgaria were very few. Some 3,000–4,000 people that stuck to their Bulgarian identity met great hostility among the authorities and the rest of the population. Occasional trials against &quot;Bulgarophiles&quot; have continued until today. The Constitutional Court of Republic of Macedonia banned the organization of the Bulgarians in the Republic of Macedonia-Radko as &quot;promoting racial and religious hate and intolerance&quot;. In 2009 the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, condemned Republic of Macedonia because of violations of the European Convention of Human Rights in this case. Nevertheless, during the last few years, rising economic prosperity and the EU membership of Bulgaria has seen around 60,000 Macedonians applying for Bulgarian citizenship; in order to obtain it they must sign a statement declaring they are &quot;Bulgarians by origin&quot;. Probably the most prominent Macedonian that applied for and was granted Bulgarian citizenship is former Prime Minister Ljubčo Georgievski. An estimated 500 Macedonians receive Bulgarian citizenship every week. This aggregates to about 50,000 Macedonian nationals who have received Bulgarian citizenship in the past 20 years. Bulgarian governments justify this policy because they regard Macedonians as &quot;ethnopolitically disoriented Bulgarians.&quot;

<text>Daphni or Dafni (Modern Greek: Δαφνί; Katharevousa: Δαφνίον, &quot;Daphnion&quot;) is an eleventh-century Byzantine monastery northwest of central Athens in the suburb of Chaidari, south of Athinon Avenue (GR-8A). It is situated near the forest of the same name, on the Sacred Way that led to Eleusis. The forest covers about , and surrounds a laurel grove. &quot;Daphni&quot; is the modern Greek name that means &quot;laurel grove&quot;, derived from Daphneion (Lauretum).

The Daphni Monastery, along with the famous monasteries of Hosios Loukas near Delphi and Nea Moni on the island of Chios, are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites for their significant historical and architectural value. These monasteries are famed as masterpieces of middle Byzantine architecture, and are especially noted for their sumptuous interior gold-ground mosaics.

== History ==
The Daphni Monastery was founded towards the end of the sixth century A.D. on the site of the Sanctuary of Apollo which had been desecrated by the Goths in 395. The Sanctuary of Apollo was built in the Ionic style using the thinnest and smallest columns. The columns stand on a base with an ornamental scroll at the top. A few of the columns of the temple have been preserved. One of the four Ionic columns of the ancient Sanctuary of Apollo remains at the site, as it was re-used in the Daphni Monastery. The other columns were removed and taken to London by Thomas Bruce, Earl of Elgin (best-known for taking the Parthenon Marbles). The columns, column bases, and column tops from the Sanctuary of Apollo are currently in the possession of the British Museum; they are currently not on display but can be seen on the museum’s website .

The first monastery on the site was constructed in the style of a castle with a basilica in the middle. It was fortified with enclosing walls and small cells that were usually just inside the walls and used by monks or nuns. The walls were attached to the church rather than standing free around the perimeter of the property and one of the columns from Apollo was built into the southern wall of the church. Some of the rectangular blocks of porous stone were also salvaged and used in the western outer wall of the church. This first monastery fell into decline when Greece was severely damaged following invasions of barbarians from the North and the sea in the ninth and tenth Centuries A.D.

During a period of renewed prosperity In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the Daphni Monastery was restored. A new octagonal church, a refectory and a chapel for the cemetery were built. The old basilica was completely demolished except for the enclosing walls and cells from the former church which were incorporated into the new church. Traces of old frescoes found on the walls show a person with bands, perhaps Emperor Basil II, holding a scroll. The craftsmanship used in the church construction suggests Basil II brought in workers from Constantinople.

The Daphni Monastery fell into decline after it was sacked by Frankish crusaders in 1205. The region became part of the Duchy of Athens under Othon de la Roche. Othon gave the Daphni Monastery to the Cistercian Abbey of Bellevaux, who added their own cloister and twin pointed arches in the Gothic style to the façade of the church. The Daphni Monastery became a popular burial place for Knights. In 1458, immediately after the coming of the Turks and the visit of Sultan Mehmed II to Athens, the Cistercians abandoned the Daphni Monastery and the Duchy of Athens was abolished.

== Architecture ==
The exterior of the church has a cloisonné style, which is very common for middle Byzantine churches in Greece. The cloisonné style of masonry consists of rectangular blocks of stone separated or framed on all four sides by bricks. The windows are set off from the cloisonné work by arched frames made of brick. The contrast between the light color of the stone blocks of the cloisonné and the red bricks around the windows, and the orange roof create a sophisticated and understated elegance.

The floor plan for the Church of Daphni is a simple Greek cross-octagon arranged with various levels of light and illumination. The upper church, particularly the dome symbolizes the Heavens while the lower area symbolizes the earth. A square bay in the center of the church is covered by a broad dome. Squinches, small half-domes that span the corner of a square are connected by tall L-shaped piers to form the transition from the square to the circle of the dome. The four squinches in the square bay transform it into an octagon. The wall surfaces fan out at the top above the squinches and join together to form the circular base of the dome. 

A Greek cross is formed by four barrel-vaulted arms of the same length that project from the center bay. Small bays covered with groin vaults (ceilings made up of two barrel vaults) that intersect at right angles give the building its rectangular shape. The bays that fill in the cross are only one-story high and with a low-level of illumination to subordinate them from the Greek cross.

== Mosaics ==
The interior of The Daphni Monastery has an elegant interplay of spaces and light with the windows at the base of the dome illuminating the vertical space above; as the space becomes taller, it also become brighter. This graduated light enhances the radiant gold-ground tesserae used to create the remarkable quality of the mosaics. The unknown artist was from the early Komnenian period (). The wide assortment of colored shades of glass tesserae further enhances the mosaics. Several important studies have been conducted on the composition of the glass used in the tesserae for these mosaics as the unusually bright color of the gold-ground tesserae and the deep brilliance of the colors combine with important stylistic qualities to make these mosaics unique One of the factors that identifies mosaics from different areas is the variance in glass used. The glass can be crafted locally or imported from other areas; in the case of Daphni, it is believed the glass was created on site. This group of mosaics is considered one of the most important and best-preserved mosaic cycles from this period. They are evidence of the iconographic and stylistic conceptions formulated at the end of the iconoclastic crisis (AD 843) by the Church of Constantinople. The decoration shows a rigid consistency in the distribution of subject characteristic of Constantinopolitan art.

In Byzantine theology, the church building was a symbol of the Christian universe, intended to reflect the splendor of heaven. A standardized program in Byzantine churches established the order in which the representations were arranged. The most sacred characters were depicted in the dome and the apse, while below, the dome scenes were arranged from higher to lower levels relating to their level of religious importance.

Visitors to the church are immediately drawn to the most important and famous of the mosaics: Christ Pantocrator (Lord of the Universe) watching over all from the crown of the dome. He is depicted with a stern face and a threatening gaze with only his head and shoulders shown. This medallion is recognized as representing exceptional artistic quality: it has been described as “one of the greatest creations in art” and &quot;[o]f all the Pantokrators in the Byzantine lands, from Kiev to Cefalu, this is the most awe-inspiring and convincing&quot;.

Christ is wearing a purple robe and a blue mantle, he is the King of Kings and shows strength, austerity and power. The artist created a bold and realistic drawing, executed with very simple means. The eyebrows are shown with a strong arch to accentuate the vertical lines and the long nose that intersects with the horizontal lines of the halo to create a symbolic cross. Several studies have been conducted in an attempt to determine whether significant changes have been made during restorations to the appearance of the Christ Pantocrator mosaic, but there is general agreement that changes have not been significant. Christ is surrounded by sixteen Prophets at the base of the dome, between the windows that illuminate Christ as the dominant figure in the church. The prophets are wearing ancient garments and hold a parchment containing text proclaiming the glory of Christ or the Second Coming.
On the pendentives there are four scenes from the life of Christ. The Crucifixion scene shows three figures: Christ on the cross, with Mary and Saint John are at the foot of the cross, one on each side. The figures are arranged in the shape of a triangle against the empty golden background. Each figure is separate and unified with the other figures. This balanced arrangement is similar to the way Greek sculptors placed their figures in the pediments of temples. The figure of St. John is depicted in a bending position, with his weight on one leg – a pose used by Greek sculptors. The body of Christ is depicted in a classic, athletic style, but unlike Greek sculpture, the anatomy is not true to life. The faces of Saint John and the Madonna have the flatness and heavy lines of the Byzantine style, but they express the calm of Greek statues.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, &quot;the ensemble represents a visualization of the Christian cosmos, its effect created by an intricately conceived interplay of pictures and architecture. Space in fact fuses the decoration into one giant image, in which the ruler, hailed by the prophets surrounding him, presides in his sphere above the host of saints that people the lower part of the room.&quot;

Other important mosaics include: Prayers of Joachim and Anna, Annunciation of Joachim, The Virgin with Anna, The Washing of the Disciples, Christ at the Last Supper, The Crucifixion, The Resurrection, Dormition of the Mother of God, Angel to Receive the Mother of God, Prophet Sophonia, St. Bacchus.

Byzantine art often survives as an ecclesiastical art. The Daphni Monastery was built during a period of renaissance in culture and art and a return to classical traditions. The figures in the mosaics are more naturalistically represented, and they blend more smoothly into their surroundings The decoration of the monastery is inspired by the spirit of the times. Faces are dematerialized, austere and depicted with unemotional expressions. The bodies are heavy and rigid, common characteristics in depicting the icons of the Bishops, Monks and the Martyrs. The pictorial perspective, the figure styles and gestures, the modeling of the figures along with simplicity of design, and the dazzling splendor of color reflecting from the gold and silver tesserae distinguish the Daphni mosaics among the mosaics of the eleventh and twelfth centuries as particularly grand specimens of Byzantine art in general.

<text>A work accident, workplace accident, occupational accident, or accident at work is a &quot;discrete occurrence in the course of work&quot; leading to physical or mental occupational injury. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), more than 337 million accidents happen on the job each year, resulting, together with occupational diseases, in more than 2.3 million deaths annually.

The phrase &quot;in the course of work&quot; can include work-related accidents happening off the company&#x27;s premises, and can include accidents caused by third parties, according to Eurostat. The definition of work accident includes accidents occurring &quot;while engaged in an economic activity, or at work, or carrying on the business of the employer&quot; according to the ILO.

The phrase &quot;physical or mental harm&quot; means any injury, disease, or death. Occupational accidents differ from occupational diseases as accidents are unexpected and unplanned occurrences (e.g., mine collapse), while occupational diseases are &quot;contracted as a result of an exposure over a period of time to risk factors arising from work activity&quot; (e.g., miner&#x27;s lung).

Incidents that fall within the definition of occupational accidents include cases of acute poisoning, attacks by humans and animals, insects etc., slips and falls on pavements or staircases, traffic collisions, and accidents on board means of transportation in the course of work, accidents in airports, stations and so on.

There is no consensus as to whether commuting accidents (i.e. accidents on the way to work and while returning home after work) should be considered to be work accidents. The ESAW methodology excludes them; the ILO includes them in its conventions concerning health &amp; safety at work, although it lists them as a separate category of accidents; and some countries (e.g., Greece) do not distinguish them from other work accidents.

A fatal accident at work is defined as an accident which leads to the death of a victim. The time within which the death may occur varies among countries: in Netherlands an accident is registered as fatal if the victim dies during the same day that the accident happened, in Germany if death came within 30 days, while Belgium, France and Greece set no time limit.

Where the accidents involve multiple fatalities, they are often referred to as industrial disasters.

==Types==
Although many workplace accidents have relatively minor repercussions, which could result in just a paper cut or scratch, others can have more serious – and potentially fatal – consequences.

For instance, there are some industries in which individuals are more exposed to occupational hazards than others, such as the construction trade. This had the highest rate of fatal injuries out of all other industry sections in 2011/12. During this period, falls accounted for 51% of construction injuries resulting in death, demonstrating that builders are more likely to fall from height than those who work in less dangerous locations, such as an office.

An independent watchdog – the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) – aims to reduce the number of work-related fatalities and injuries within Great Britain, publishing statistics that show the different – and most common – types of reported workplace injuries across a range of sectors.

For example, the HSE reported that, between 2011 and 2012, incidents such as falls from height, becoming trapped by a falling structure, and being struck by a vehicle or moving object, were the reasons for the majority of fatalities to British workers.

It was also revealed that slips, trips or falls were responsible for more than 50% of serious injuries to employees. Furthermore, the majority of incidents that resulted in employees taking more than three days off work – or affected their ability to perform their usual duties over this period – were caused by handling accidents.

Although some accidents at work can have minor effects, the HSE statistics revealed that more than 27 million working days were lost between 2011 and 2012 due to occupational illness or personal injury, proving that these incidents can have serious repercussions. In 2019, construction employment climbed to 11.4 million workers. There are online guides that provide information on how to deal with an injury at work. In 2019, construction employment climbed to 11.4 million workers.

==Causal factors==

Accidents arise from unsafe behavior and/or unsafe conditions. An important factor is the safety climate or safety culture of an organization. Safety culture concerns how workplace safety is managed, consisting of the shared attitudes, beliefs, perceptions, and values among employees. Faulty equipment can also cause serious personal injuries, a common example being accidents from faulty ladders. If the rubber feet are absent, the base of the aluminium stile can slip suddenly on a hard floor and the user can fall.

==Benefits of prevention==

According to the Health and Safety Executive, employers who implement suitable measures to prevent accidents in the workplace could reap a number of benefits. As well as reducing the number of injuries at work, managers could also:
* Be less likely to suffer legal action
* Acquire a better reputation amongst partners, investors, customers and suppliers
* Have employees who feel more motivated, demonstrating greater productivity
* Reduce costs
* Have reduced employee turnover and absence rates. It has been reported that over 2,000,000 working days each year are lost due to handling accidents and slips and trips alone. In Argentina, the work accident rate in the year 2018 decreased 10% from the previous year.

== Determining Liability ==
Depending on the circumstances of a workplace accident, several different parties may be held liable. These may include the employer, employees, property owner, manufacturer, or other third parties. For example, if it can be proven that an employer was negligent by allowing unsafe working conditions to persist, they may be held responsible for any resulting accidents or injuries. Comprehensive evidence will be needed to support a work injury claim and prove negligence. Types of evidence include accident reports, witness statements, surveillance footage, photos, and videos.

==Examples==
During the 2015 shooting of the movie &quot;Resident Evil: The Final Chapter&quot;, stuntwoman Olivia Jackson had her arm amputated
after her motorbike crashed to a metal camera arm during a high-speed chase.

Matilda Rapaport died from an avalanche while filming an advertisement for the 2016 video game &quot;Steep&quot;.

<doc id="483405" wikidata="Q5970908" url="?curid=483405" title="USS Wahoo (SS-565)">
<text>USS &quot;Wahoo&quot; (SS-565), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the wahoo, a fast-moving predatory sportfish found in oceans worldwide.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Wahoo&quot; was awarded to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, and her keel was laid down on 24 October 1949. She was launched on 16 October 1951 sponsored by Mrs. Harry W. Hill, and commissioned on Memorial Day, 30 May 1952, with Commander Eugene P. Wilkinson in command.

==Operational history==

===1952–1964===
Following a shakedown cruise to the British West Indies and post-shakedown repairs at Portsmouth, &quot;Wahoo&quot; got underway for her home port, Pearl Harbor, on 1 December 1952. After a stop at New London, Connecticut, she proceeded to the Canal Zone, transited the Panama Canal, and then touched at San Diego, California, before continuing on to Oahu. The submarine spent the entire year 1953 in training and evaluation exercises conducted in the Hawaiian Islands operating area. The warship also served as a target for surface and air units practicing their own antisubmarine warfare (ASW) tactics.

In January 1954, &quot;Wahoo&quot; embarked upon her first tour of duty with the Seventh Fleet in the western Pacific. For about six months, she cruised Far Eastern waters with ships of the Seventh Fleet conducting various exercises and visiting Oriental ports. She returned to Pearl Harbor in June and underwent her first shipyard overhaul before resuming local operations in the Hawaiian Islands. In March 1955, the submarine took time from her busy training schedule to visit Tahiti. At the conclusion of that voyage, she then resumed duty at Hawaii but, in November, embarked upon her second assignment with the Seventh Fleet. The Oriental cruise brought port calls to Hong Kong; Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Apra Harbor, Guam; Yokosuka, Japan; and Manila and Subic Bay in the Philippines. Her deployment ended in May 1956 when she returned to Pearl Harbor to resume local operations and training exercises.

Such duty was broken in April by a yard overhaul which lasted until October 1957. In November, the ship made a shakedown voyage back to Tahiti. Soon after her return to Hawaii, &quot;Wahoo&quot; stood out of Pearl Harbor on her way back to the western Pacific. Normal training operations and a schedule of port visits occupied her time during the six-month assignment in the Far East. The warship returned to Pearl Harbor in June 1958 and, soon thereafter, she received the Battle &quot;E&quot; for Submarine Squadron (SubRon) 1 attesting to her overall operational and administrative superiority within the unit. She spent the ensuing year in the Hawaiian Islands conducting training operations for the most part. In November, she began a two-month repair period at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard at the conclusion of which, in January 1959, she resumed local operations.

In June, the submarine transferred administratively from SubRon 1 to SubRon 7; and, in July, she headed west once more for a tour in the Far East. Again, training exercises predominated with &quot;Wahoo&quot; serving as target in ASW practice and participating in several fleet exercises. She returned to Oahu at the beginning of 1960 and, after two months of normal operations once again entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard this time for a major overhaul. Exiting the yard in late August, she conducted refresher training and then resumed her normal schedule of operations in the Hawaiian Islands.

That employment continued during the first three months of 1961. Late in March, she began a month-long battery renewal at the end of which, in late April, she began preparations for another overseas deployment. On 22 May, &quot;Wahoo&quot; departed Pearl Harbor and shaped a westward course. During that cruise with the Seventh Fleet, she visited Yokosuka, Sasebo, and Hakodate in Japan and stopped at Naha on the island of Okinawa. After six months of operations and exercises in the Far East, she headed home, returning to Pearl Harbor on 7 November. A year of normal operations in the Hawaiian group followed, and, in December 1962, she began preparations for another cruise to the western Pacific. The ship stood out of Pearl Harbor on 15 January 1963 to begin a six-month tour of duty during which she added Osaka to her ports of call in Japan. That cruise ended on 15 July when she reentered Pearl Harbor and resumed her normal Hawaiian schedule of training operations, interrupted between October 1963 and April 1964 by a major overhaul.

===Vietnam War===
During the summer of 1964, she returned to local operations out of Pearl Harbor. In August, however, the Gulf of Tonkin Incident occurred and changed the complexion of her deployments. When she returned to the Far East in November, the August occurrence had already spurred an increased American involvement in the Vietnam War. As a consequence of that change, &quot;Wahoo&quot; was called upon to do two tours of duty in the waters off Vietnam during a deployment of extended duration.

She returned to Hawaii in June 1965 and remained in the vicinity until February 1966, which earned the ship a Navy Unit Commendation. During her 1966 western Pacific cruise, which began on 17 February and ended on 29 August, she returned to the combat zone off Vietnam as well as fulfilling a schedule of Seventh Fleet exercises and port visits. Upon her arrival back to Oahu, the submarine began an extended period of operations in the islands, broken by a major overhaul of 17 months&#x27; duration. That overhaul included radical modifications to her hull structure during which she was lengthened by to receive the PUFFS passive sonar installation.

She completed her extended overhaul in the latter part of June 1968 and, following refresher training, she resumed local operations out of Pearl Harbor. On 11 February 1969, &quot;Wahoo&quot; departed Oahu on her way to the Far East for the eighth time in her career. That deployment brought only a very brief tour in the Vietnam combat zone; otherwise, she conducted a normal peacetime deployment visiting Oriental ports and participating in Seventh Fleet training exercises.

She returned to Pearl Harbor on 14 August and took up her usual training routine in the Hawaiian Islands. Her ninth tour of duty in the western Pacific began on 1 April 1970. During the last week of the month, she again cruised briefly in the combat zone off Vietnam; but, as in the previous deployment, she spent the remainder engaged in a normal Seventh Fleet schedule of operations. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 21 October and began an overhaul which was completed on 1 June 1971.

On the same day that she completed her overhaul, &quot;Wahoo&quot; departed Pearl Harbor and shaped a course for her new home port, San Diego, California. En route, she visited Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, British Columbia. The submarine arrived at San Diego on 26 June and began type training and other local operations along the southern California coast. The change in home ports, however, did not signal an end to tours of duty in the western Pacific. Her next deployment brought with it a visit to Chinhae and Pusan in Korea and a period of combined operations with units of the South Korean Navy. Later in that cruise, she also visited Taiwan and participated in bilateral ASW exercises with units of the Republic of China Navy. She finally concluded the deployment at San Diego on 28 April 1972. After a series of brief exercises with ships and aircraft during the month of May, she entered Hunters Point Naval Shipyard for a three-month overhaul. Back at sea by the middle of September, she resumed local operations – type training, ASW exercises with surface units and aircraft, and torpedo and mine evaluation tests – for the remainder of the year.

On 16 February 1973, the submarine exited San Diego harbor to embark upon her 11th tour of duty with the Seventh Fleet. Bilateral exercises with the South Korean and Nationalist Chinese navies again highlighted a normal peacetime deployment. This time, however, she also joined units of the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force in ASW training operations. She returned to San Diego on 14 August and resumed operations in the southern California operating area which were highlighted by submarine against submarine exercises which included firing exercise torpedoes. Local operations occupied her through the end of 1973 and during the first five months of 1974. On 14 June 1974, she entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for an extended overhaul which lasted until July 1975. &quot;Wahoo&quot; completed post overhaul sea trials on 23 July and, after visiting Seattle, Washington, for the 1975 &quot;Sea Fair&quot; and conducting weapons systems tests and electronics accuracy trials off the coast of the Pacific northwest, she returned to San Diego on 28 August. She then resumed local operations — including a tour as school ship for prospective commanding officers in November and refresher training in December — which kept her busy until the beginning of April 1976.

On 2 April, she stood out of San Diego to resume deployments with the Seventh Fleet. During that assignment, she participated in Seventh Fleet exercises, bilateral exercises with South Korean naval units, and SEAL team exercises with United States Marine Corps and South Korean naval personnel. She completed the tour of duty on 8 September and began the voyage home. She returned to San Diego at the beginning of October and resumed operations along the coast of southern California.

On 6 September 1977, she departed San Diego to transfer to the Atlantic Fleet. Steaming via the Panama Canal; Cartagena, Colombia; Miami, Florida, and Savannah, Georgia, she arrived at New London, Connecticut, on 15 October. On 1 November, she began training a crew from the Iranian Navy scheduled to take possession of her sister-ship sometime the following year. That duty continued until the summer of 1978 and included a six-week Caribbean deployment early in 1978 in support of ReadEx 1–78. On 6 July 1978, the submarine began an extended overhaul at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard to prepare her to be handed over to Iran and renamed &quot;Nahang&quot;. These plans were cancelled on 31 March 1979 following the Iranian revolution. &quot;Wahoo&quot; was instead decommissioned on 27 June 1980 and cannibalized for parts for the other &quot;Tang&quot;s that were still in service to foreign governments. ex-&quot;Wahoo&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 July 1983, and in November 1984 her hull was sold for scrap.

The former airport is in the western part of the municipal unit, near the coast. Most of the residential area is in the eastern part, east of the former airport. The northern part of the airport has been converted to a sports complex. There are plans to convert the remaining part into a park.

Elliniko is well connected to the centre of Athens through a new line of the Athens metro (Elliniko station). The Athens Tram serves the coastal part of Elliniko.

===Climate===
According to the data provided by the Hellenic National Meteorological Service, Elliniko, like much of the southern suburbs of Athens, has an average annual temperature of and receives of precipitation per year thus it marginally falls into the &quot;BSh&quot; hot semi-arid climate category with strong Mediterranean influences (&quot;Csa&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification. The highest temperature recorded is on August 3, 2021, while the lowest is on 18 February 2008. The highest minimum temperature of was recorded on July 26, 2023. 
Fog is rare, while thunderstorms occur sparsely throughout the year. Snowfall is not very common, though it occurs almost every year, but it rarely causes severe disruption to daily life.

==Economy==
Hellenic Imperial Airways had its head office in Elliniko. The Greek Civil Aviation Authority also has its head office in Elliniko. Elliniko is also home for the Greek national weather agency (ΕΜΥ).

==Sports==
Hellinikon Olympic Complex is located in Elliniko. It was built for the staging of the 2004 Summer Olympics and consists five venues. Elliniko also houses the basketball club Elliniko-Sourmena B.C. with many achievements in women&#x27;s basketball.

<text>Nea Ionia (, meaning New Ionia) is a town and a northern suburb of the Athens agglomeration, Greece, and a municipality of the Attica region. It was named after Ionia, the region in Anatolia from which many Greeks migrated in the 1920s as a part of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey. Many of the town families originated from the town of Alanya which is currently a part of Turkey.

Nea Ionia is 7 km northeast of Athens city centre. The municipality has an area of 4.421 km2. It is served by three Line 1 metro stations: , and .

==History==
In the past, the area was named Podarades after Greek Revolution Hero of Albanian origin Ziliftar Poda and his followers, settled in this area. The modern settlement was built after the Greco-Turkish War (1919-22) and the subsequent population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923. That year refugees, mainly from Pisidia of Asia Minor, settled in the area. The new settlement was originally named Nea Pisidia. But later, due to the arrival of many refugees from other places of Ionia, the settlement was finally named Nea Ionia. The suburb developed rapidly thanks to carpet handicrafts. The refugees carried their expertise to Athens and opened important carpet handicrafts. This branch was the main economical source for the residents of Nea Ionia for many years. Nea Ionia gradually increased its population and expanded into a large area. The suburb is composed of 13 neighborhoods: Nea Ionia (Center), Perissos, Inepoli, Pefkakia, Saframpoli, Neapoli, Eleftheroupoli, Alsoupoli, Kalogreza, Lazarou, Anthrakorihia, Irini, Omorfoklissia and Palaiologou.

<doc id="483416" wikidata="Q5499617" url="?curid=483416" title="Free-living Amoebozoa infection">
<text>Free-living amoebae (or &quot;FLA&quot;) are a group of protozoa that are important causes of infectious disease in humans and animals.

&quot;Naegleria fowleri&quot; is often included in the group &quot;free-living amoebae&quot;, and this species causes a usually fatal condition traditionally called primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). However, the genus &quot;Naegleria&quot; is now considered part of the Excavata, not the Amoebozoa, and is considered to be much more closely related to &quot;Leishmania&quot; and &quot;Trypanosoma&quot;.

==Presentation==
&quot;Acanthamoeba spp.&quot; causes mostly subacute or chronic granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE), with a clinical picture of headaches, altered mental status, and focal neurologic deficit, which progresses over several weeks to death. In addition, &quot;Acanthamoeba spp.&quot; can cause granulomatous skin lesions and, more seriously, keratitis and corneal ulcers following corneal trauma or in association with contact lenses.

==Life cycle==
&quot;Acanthamoeba spp&quot;. and &quot;Balamuthia mandrillaris&quot; are opportunistic free-living amoebae capable of causing granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE) in individuals with compromised immune systems.
* &quot;Acanthamoeba spp.&quot; have been found in soil; fresh, brackish, and sea water; sewage; swimming pools; contact lens equipment; medicinal pools; dental treatment units; dialysis machines; heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems; mammalian cell cultures; vegetables; human nostrils and throats; and human and animal brain, skin, and lung tissues.
* &quot;B. mandrillaris&quot; however, has not been isolated from the environment but has been isolated from autopsy specimens of infected humans and animals.
Unlike &quot;N. fowleri&quot;, &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; and &quot;Balamuthia&quot; have only two stages, cysts and trophozoites, in their life cycle. No flagellated stage exists as part of the life cycle. The trophozoites replicate by mitosis (nuclear membrane does not remain intact) . The trophozoites are the infective forms and are believed to gain entry into the body through the lower respiratory tract, ulcerated or broken skin and invade the central nervous system by hematogenous dissemination . &quot;Acanthamoeba spp.&quot; and &quot;Balamuthia mandrillaris&quot; cysts and trophozoites are found in tissue.

==Diagnosis==
In &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; infections, the diagnosis can be made from microscopic examination of stained smears of biopsy specimens (brain tissue, skin, cornea) or of corneal scrapings, which may detect trophozoites and cysts. Cultivation of the causal organism, and its identification by direct immunofluorescent antibody, may also prove useful. Laboratory workers and physicians often mistake the organisms on wet mount for monocytes and a diagnosis of viral meningitis is mistakenly given if the organisms are not motile. Heating a copper penny with an alcohol lamp and placing it on the wet mount slide will activate sluggish trophozoites and more rapidly make the diagnosis. If the person performing the spinal tap rapidly looks at the heated wet mount slide the trophozoites can be seen to swarm while monocytes do not.

==Treatment==

Eye and skin infections caused by &quot;Acanthamoeba spp.&quot; are generally treatable. Topical use of 0.1% propamidine isethionate (Brolene) plus neomycin-polymyxin B-gramicidin ophthalmic solution has been a successful approach; keratoplasty is often necessary in severe infections. Although most cases of brain (CNS) infection with &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; have resulted in death, patients have recovered from the infection with proper treatment.

==Geographic distribution==

While infrequent, infections appear to occur worldwide.

<text>HMS &quot;Javelin&quot; was a J-class destroyer of the Royal Navy.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Javelin&quot; was laid down by John Brown and Company, Limited, at Clydebank in Scotland on 11 October 1937, launched on 21 December 1938, and commissioned on 10 June 1939 with the pennant number F61.

In May 1940, during Operation Dynamo, &quot;Javelin&quot; and other destroyers rescued survivors from the sinking of .

At the end of November 1940 the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, consisting of HMS &quot;Jupiter&quot;, &quot;Javelin&quot;, &quot;Jackal&quot;, &quot;Jersey&quot;, and &quot;Kashmir&quot;, under Captain Lord Louis Mountbatten, was operating off Plymouth, England. The flotilla engaged the German destroyers &quot;Hans Lody&quot;, &quot;Richard Beitzen&quot;, and &quot;Karl Galster&quot;. &quot;Javelin&quot; was badly damaged by gunfire and torpedoes fired by the German destroyers, losing both her bow and her stern. Only of &quot;Javelin&quot;″s original length remained afloat and she was towed back to harbour. &quot;Javelin&quot; was out of action for almost a year. A total of 45 officers and ratings were killed in this action.
&quot;Javelin&quot; participated in the Operation Ironclad assault on Madagascar in May 1942.

She participated in the failed Operation Vigorous attempt to deliver a supply convoy to Malta, in June 1942. &quot;Javelin&quot; along with destroyed a flotilla of Italian small ships on the night of 19 January 1943.

&quot;Javelin&quot; record was marred on 17 October 1945 whilst off Rhodes by an outbreak of indiscipline (a refusal to work by “Hostilities Only” ratings following resentment over a return to pre-war spit-and-polish): one leading rating was charged with mutiny, and several ratings were subsequently court-martialled, though sentences were reduced as the facts became known.

&quot;Javelin&quot; was sold to the shipbreakers on 11 June 1949, and she was scrapped at Troon in Scotland.

<text>Psychiko ( ) is a town and a suburb in the Athens agglomeration, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Filothei-Psychiko, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit. The municipality has an area of .

==Overview==
Psychiko is located 5 km northeast of Athens city centre. It is a strictly residential suburb of Athens, with commercial businesses allowed only within two small designated zones, the &quot;Nea Agora&quot; (New Market) and the &quot;Palaia Agora&quot; (Old Market), with current regulations also restricting buildings to full detachment, and a maximum of 3 floors. Psychiko was historically the home of aristocrats, members of the Greek royal family, and generally old money people. The area remains one of the wealthiest suburbs of Athens, with very high land value, and a number of embassies, particularly of rich Middle Eastern countries, to be found located in Psychiko, and neighbouring Filothei. 

This was once home to Queen Frederica of the Hellenes, until the military coup d&#x27;état of 1967. Andreas Papandreou and his wife Margaret also lived in Psychiko before the dictatorship. Later, when he became Prime Minister he left Psychiko and moved to Ekali. In recent decades however, many prominent families choose to build their houses in the southern, seaside suburbs, like Glyfada or Vouliagmeni. A number of private schools are located in Psychiko: Athens College and Psychiko College, Moraitis School, the Arsakeio, and the Varvakeio.

==Name==
The name literally means &quot;an act of charity&quot;. A popular legend about the battle of Marathon and the Marathon run was recorded by Andreas Karkavitsas in the 19th century, and also by Linos Politis.

<text>Tripoli (; ) is a city in the central part of the Peloponnese, in Greece. It is the capital of the Peloponnese region as well as of the regional unit of Arcadia. The homonymous municipality had 44,165 inhabitants in 2021.

==Etymology==

In the Middle Ages the place was known as Drobolitsa, Droboltsá, or Dorboglitza, either from the Greek Hydropolitsa, &#x27;Water City&#x27; or perhaps from the South Slavic for &#x27;Plain of Oaks&#x27;. The association made by 18th- and 19th-century scholars with the idea of the &quot;three cities&quot; (Τρίπολις, τρεις πόλεις &quot;three cities&quot;: variously Callia, Dipoena and Nonacris, mentioned by Pausanias without geographical context, or Tegea, Mantineia and Pallantium, or Mouchli, Tegea and Mantineia or Nestani, Mouchli and Thana), were considered paretymologies by G.C. Miles. An Italian geographical atlas of 1687 notes the fort of &quot;Goriza e Mandi et Dorbogliza&quot;; a subsequent Italian geographical dictionary of 1827 attributes the name Dorbogliza to the ruins of Mantineia (&quot;Mandi&quot;) and states that it is located north of &quot;Tripolizza&quot;. In 1463, it was spelled Droboliza and existed in ruins. The Ottoman Turks would later refer to the town and district as Tripoliça, Trepoliça, and Trapoliça.

==History==
Little is known about Drobolitza, but it is included in a list of abandoned Byzantine sites from 1467, corresponding with the years after Mehmed&#x27;s conquest of this part of Greece. However, following the Ottoman conquest of Morea, it seems that the cultural and administrative centre of the Tegean plain was moved from Mouchli to Drobolitza. This was development occurring some years after the conquest, sometime after 1467. After 1540, the focus seems to have changed from the fortress itself, to the settlement below it called Tarabluca, that would be the next political centre of the plain. French archaeologist visited the ruins of Tarabluca in 1829, and could still observe the ruins of Drobolitza at this time.

In spring 1770 during a Greek uprising known as Orlov Revolt, the revolutionary armies were halted out of Tripolitsa. In retaliation for the Greek uprising, Albanian mercenaries of the Ottomans slaughtered 3,000 Greeks in a few hours upon entering the city. Total massacre and destruction of the city was avoided after intervention of Osman bey, leader of the Albanian mercenaries.

Before the Greek War of Independence, under the Ottoman name of &quot;Tripoliçe&quot;, it was one of the Ottoman administrative centers in the Peloponnese (the Morea Eyalet, often called &quot;pashalik of Tripolitsa&quot;) and had large Muslim (mainly Turkish and Albanian) and Jewish populations. Tripolis was one of the main targets of the Greek insurgents in the Greek War of Independence, who stormed it on 17 October 1821, following the bloody siege of Tripolitsa, and exterminated the Muslim and Jewish populations.

Ibrahim Pasha retook the city on June 22, 1825, after it had been abandoned by the Greeks. Before he evacuated the Peloponnese in early 1828, he destroyed the city and tore down its walls.

After the independent Greek state was established in 1830, the old Ottoman buildings of Tripolizza, such as the walls, were completely destroyed or demolished.

Tripoli was renamed and rebuilt and was developed as one of the main cities of the Kingdom of Greece, serving as the capital of the Arcadia district. During the 19th and the 20th centuries the city emerged to be the administrative, economic, commercial and transportation center of central and south Peloponnese.

==Geography and climate==
The city of Tripoli has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;). Ιt is located in the center of the Peloponnese, at the western border of a large basin (a polje at about 650 m in altitude, a length of ca. 30 km and a width between 12,5 and 2,5 km). The city is today the capital of the regional unit Arcadia (residents, city alone, ca. 30 000, district with hinterland ca. 47500, 2011 Greek census). At its west the city borders the thickly wooded mountain-area “Mainalo”. The Tripoli Basin has gradually been rainwater regulated (mainly after 1945) and turned into farmland. In the southwest floods, which appear in the basin occasionally after rainy winters, as in 2003, formed the temporary Lake Taka. This lake was regulated by a new pond, to retain water for irrigation.

Because of its inland location and high altitude, Tripoli&#x27;s climate has some continental characteristics, such as some very cold lows during the winter months. Summer temperatures can exceed and in winter temperatures below have been observed on several occasions. Snow or sleet can occur several times between November and early April.

Its main plazas are aligned with the main street and with a highway linking to Pyrgos and Patras. One of them is named Kennedy, the other is named Georgiou B&#x27; (George II). The southern part has its main street named Washington. The main section of the city is enclosed around the castle walls that were built during the Ottoman occupation of Greece. An industrial park has been built in the southwest.


== Surrounding area and geology ==

In the large Tripoli Basin and in vast parts of the wider geological formations of the Arcadian Highland tectonics in the dominant carbonate rock &quot;Tripoliza&quot; of the Peloponnese developed a special topography: There are several plains, &quot;intra mountainous basins&quot;, even &quot;closed basins&quot;: Besides small basins, there are the Tripoli-Basin, the &quot;Argon Pedion&quot; (an almost separated side basin in the northeast of Tripoli), the Basin of Levidi and the Basin of Vlacherna Arcadia/Hotoussa/Kandila).

The peculiarity of all plains and basins in Arcadia is the coincidence with intensive karstification: Water seeps into the underground, rather than eroding and draining the topography by surface waterways. All drainage runs through ponors (in Greek: καταβόθρες) and subterranean waterways. There are 45 ponors in the above named basins. There are 7 ponors around Lake Taka. When winter rains are heavy, the ground is flooded or temporary lakes form, even today, as drainage through ponors is often slow which causes land cultivation delays.

==Municipality==

The municipality of Tripoli was formed at the 2011 local government reform by merging these 8 former municipalities, that became municipal units:
*Falanthos
*Korythio
*Levidi
*Mantineia
*Skiritida
*Tegea
*Tripoli
*Valtetsi

The municipality has an area of 1,475.805 km2, the municipal unit 119.287 km2.

===Subdivisions===
The municipal unit of Tripoli is subdivided into these communities:
*Agios Vasileios
*Agios Konstantinos
*Evandro
*Makri
*Merkovouni
*Pallantio
*Pelagos
*Perthori
*Skopi
*Thanas
*Tripoli

==Education==
Tripoli is the flagship campus of the University of the Peloponnese, founded in 2000. 

UoP Tripoli is the location of the School of Economy, Management and Informatics, composed of the Department of Economics and the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications.

==Transportation==
Because it is at the centre of the Peloponnese, Tripolis is a transportation hub. Corinth is NE, Pyrgos E, Patras NW, Kalamata SW, and Sparti S.

Tripoli is mainly accessed from Athens and the rest of Greece through the A7 toll motorway, which runs northbound towards Corinth and southbound to Kalamata. An alternative toll-free route is the GR-7 which used to be the main highway to Tripoli before the construction of the motorway. The city is also accessed by GR-74 and GR-76 from Pyrgos and by GR-39 from Sparta.

Tripoli is served by the metre gauge railway line from Corinth to Kalamata of the Hellenic Railways Organisation (OSE). The line was renovated and passenger services to Árgos and Corinth, which had been suspended for a few years, were reinstated in 2009. However, in December 2010 services ceased again due to the general suspension of railway services in the Peloponnese.

==Military==
Tripoli is home to the two largest Armed Forces bootcamps in Greece, one operated by the Hellenic Army and one by the Hellenic Air Force: the 251st Army Training Battalion and the 124th Basic Training Wing.

==Sports==
Tripoli hosts three sport clubs with presence in the higher national divisions in Greek football and basketball. These clubs are shown below.
==In popular culture==
The siege of Tripolitsa was made famous in the folk (Δημοτικό) song &quot;40 παλικάρια από την Λιβαδειά&quot; (&quot;Forty lads from Livadeia&quot;)

<text>HMS &quot;Jervis&quot;, was a J-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy in the late 1930s. She was named after Admiral John Jervis (1735–1823). She was laid down by R. and W. Hawthorn, Leslie and Company, Limited, at Hebburn-on-Tyne on 26 August 1937. The ship was launched on 9 September 1938 and commissioned on 8 May 1939, four months before the start of the Second World War.

Designed as a flotilla leader to the J-class destroyers, who were intended to make up the 7th Destroyer Flotilla, &quot;Jervis&quot; was the sister ship of, and identical to, , leader to the K class (forming the 8th Flotilla) and similar to of the N class. However, despite an impressive war record (she earned 13 battle honours) she remains virtually unknown compared to her sister, &quot;Kelly&quot;.

==Service history==

===1939 (Home Waters)===
When war broke out in September 1939, &quot;Jervis&quot; was under the command of Captain Philip Mack, and was leader of the 7th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) based in the Humber. The first six months of hostilities was taken up with sweeps across the North Sea, in &quot;appalling weather conditions&quot; which saw the Flotilla suffer a succession of storm and collision damage. During this time &quot;Jervis&quot; captured three blockade runners, one on the second day of the war, and helped search for the merchant ship . In March 1940 &quot;Jervis&quot; was involved in a collision with the Swedish freighter SS &quot;Tor&quot;, that put her in dock for the next three months for repairs.

===1940 (Mediterranean)===
During this time Mack, as Captain (D) led the Flotilla from , and in May 1940 sailed with her for the Mediterranean to take command of the 14th Destroyer Flotilla. &quot;Jervis&quot;&#x27; pennant number changed to G00 around this time In July, after working-up trials, she joined him in Malta, where he resumed command. For the next two years &quot;Jervis&quot; saw action in a constant round of operations; sweeps along the coast, bombarding shore targets for the Army, protecting convoys to Malta, and screening major fleet movements.

===1941===
In 1941 &quot;Jervis&quot; was involved in a number of fleet actions. In March she was at Battle of Cape Matapan. In the course of the battle she was involved in the destruction of the Italian cruiser which had been crippled by heavy guns in attempting to recover the , which had been stricken by an aerial torpedo. Then &quot;Jervis&quot; came alongside &quot;Pola&quot; and boarded her, taking off the wounded before, with the destroyer , torpedoing and sinking &quot;Pola&quot;. In April she led the force that annihilated an Axis convoy at the action off Sfax. In May she was in the Battle of Crete, where many Royal Navy ships were lost, including her sister ship &quot;Kelly&quot;. During the summer &quot;Jervis&quot; ran supplies to the beleaguered port of Tobruk and in December led the destroyers at the First Battle of Sirte. On returning to Alexandria, she was damaged in an Italian human torpedo attack which left her in dock for six weeks. The same attack badly damaged the battleships and . Her Chaplain, George Sherlock, was awarded the DSC for &quot;outstanding zeal, patience, and cheerfulness and for setting an example of wholehearted devotion to duty.&quot;

===1942===
Released at the end of January, she resumed operations. In April she joined the Malta Strike Force, although without Mack who left &quot;Jervis&quot; in March due to ill-health and was replaced as captain of &quot;Jervis&quot;, and Captain (D), by A.L Poland. He would command her, and lead the 14th Destroyer Flotilla, for the next year. In March 1942, under Poland&#x27;s leadership, she again led the destroyers at the Second Battle of Sirte.

===1943===
On the night of 1/2 June, an Italian convoy of two supply ships escorted by a destroyer and a torpedo boat, was intercepted in the Battle of the Messina Convoy by &quot;Jervis&quot; (commanded by Captain A.F Pugsley) and the Greek destroyer &quot;Vasilissa Olga&quot;. A Wellington bomber dropped flares and after a short battle lasting half an hour, the two Allied destroyers sank the .

&quot;Jervis&quot; also saw action during the landings in Sicily, Calabria, Salerno, and Anzio, as well as operations in the Adriatic. She supported both the Eighth Army and Yugoslav partisans. In the autumn of 1943, &quot;Jervis&quot; was in the Aegean supporting the ill-fated operation against the Dodecanese Islands. On 16/17 October with , sank the submarine chaser at Kalymnos.

===1944 (Home Waters)===
On 23 January 1944 &quot;Jervis&quot; had her bows blown off while in company with &quot;Janus&quot;, the other destroyer being sunk by a German Fritz X guided bomb. There were no casualties and the damaged destroyer made it to Naples under her own power where, on 28 January her commanding officer, Captain Henderson, took over command of the flotilla leader &quot;Grenville&quot; while the latter&#x27;s captain, Lieutenant Commander Roger Hill became CO of the damaged &quot;Jervis&quot;.
The damaged destroyer subsequently steamed to Gibraltar where a new bow was put on the vessel. Then returning to Britain, no longer a Flotilla leader, &quot;Jervis&quot; saw action at the Normandy landings in the closing stages of the war. She was decommissioned in September 1944, paying off at Chatham prior to a further, major re-fit.

===1945 and post-war===
Re-commissioned in May 1945, &quot;Jervis&quot; saw further service in the Mediterranean, policing the aftermath of World War II. She paid off into the reserve at Chatham in May 1946, and was then laid-up in the Gareloch where she was used for training of local Sea Cadets. Placed on the Disposal List in October 1947, she was one of a number of ships used for explosives trials in Loch Striven during 1948.

==Fate==
&quot;Jervis&quot; was handed over to the British Iron and Steel Corporation for demolition in January 1949 and allocated to Arnott Young, arriving at Troon, on the Firth of Clyde for breaking up in September.

==&quot;Lucky Jervis&quot;==
&quot;Jervis&quot; had a reputation as a lucky ship (in contrast to her sister, &quot;Kelly&quot;, who seemed to have more than her share of bad luck). Despite a long and active career, in 5½ years of war and 13 major actions, not one of her crew was lost to enemy action, possibly a unique record. An example of her luck might be seen in her action at Anzio in January 1944. Supporting the landing with gunfire, &quot;Jervis&quot; and her sister ship, &quot;Janus&quot;, were attacked by enemy aircraft using Henschel Hs 293 glider bombs. Both were hit; &quot;Janus&quot;’ forward magazine exploded, sinking her with the loss of nearly 160 of her crew; &quot;Jervis&quot;’ bow was blown off, but the destroyer was able to steam at about eight knots back to safety in Naples. Astonishingly, not one of her crew was harmed in this incident, and she was able to rescue over 80 of &quot;Janus&quot;’ crew.

==Battle honours==
&quot;Jervis&quot; was awarded 13 battle honours for her service during the Second World War.
* Mediterranean 1940–44
* Libya 1940–42
* Malta convoys 1941–42
* Matapan 1941
* Sfax 1941
* Crete 1941
* Sirte 1942
* Sicily 1943
* Salerno 1943
* Aegean 1943
* Adriatic 1944
* Anzio 1944
* Normandy 1944

Only and , who served in the Mediterranean with &quot;Jervis&quot; matched this record; it was exceeded by , the Mediterranean Fleet flagship, which saw service in both World Wars.

<text>Vrilissia () is a suburban town and a municipality of the North Athens regional unit, in the Attica region. It is located in the Athens basin, at the southwestern foot of the Penteli Mountain. At the 2021 census, the municipality had 32,417 residents.

==Geography==

The administrative limits of the municipality extend from the Chalandri gully up to foothills of the Penteli, known as Patima and Koufos Hills. Vrilissia lies approximately north-east of the centre of the Greek capital and northwest of the city of Pallini, centre of East Attica. The area of the Vrilissia municipality is .

Among the municipality&#x27;s features one notices the low rise profile with four apartment floors maximum at the center, while particularly high is also the rate of private gardens. The centre of the municipality is built up around the Analipseos Main Church (Jesus Christ&#x27;s Ascension Church), while the commercial area mainly extends throughout the Penteli Avenue. The municipality is generally composed of residents among the median and upper income bands.
The municipality is connected with all urban and suburban means of transport of Attica. The Athens northern beltway A6 motorway (Greece) and the short A621 motorway pass through the municipality. It is served by two commuter railway stations (Doukissis Plakentias station and Pentelis station) and a metro station (Doukissis Plakentias). Several (and relatively frequent) buses serve destinations to neighbouring suburbs as well as the centre of Athens. The main thoroughfare is Pentelis Avenue, which connects Vrilissia with Chalandri and central Athens.

==History==

In antiquity the area of Vrilissia formed part of the deme of Phlya, which covered the land spanning from Psychiko to Agia Paraskevi and mainly centered on what is now known as the Municipality of Chalandri.

Vrilissia was part of the municipality of Chalandri until 1949, when it became a separate community. It became a municipality in 1990. The suburb experienced rapid development during 2004 as a result of city improvements for the Athens Olympic Games, with the city&#x27;s peripheral road circuit completed, works of the city&#x27;s regeneration, widening of the central avenue and diverting of the inner traffic. After long-lasting conflicts, the Naval Base region was transferred to the municipality with an official ceremony, while many small parks were created in each neighbourhood.

Tax Values of the land in 2007 fluctuate from €1,550 – 2,050 / m2, in similar levels with the neighbouring Chalandri and Agia Paraskevi. Actual selling prices broke through the barrier of the €2,000 / m2 reaching between €2,200 and 3,000 / m2. 

Mayor of municipality since 2007 is Mr Kostas Ioannidis, while Mr Nikos Papadopoulos is granted with the title of Emeritus President of the Municipality as chairman of the Vrilissia Community for many years, assisting on local issues. From January 2024 mayor is Mr Ioannis Pisimisis.

==Etymology==

One may come across many references of the &quot;Vrilissos&quot; (or alternatively &quot;Vrilittos&quot;) name in some of Thucydides, Herodotus and Strabo&#x27;s writings. The name probably means &quot;Great Rock&quot; and derives from the words &quot;vri&quot; (βρι), meaning &quot;forceful&quot;, from the verb &quot;vriao&quot; (βριάω), meaning &quot;I&#x27;m full of power&quot;, &quot;li&quot; (λη), from the word &quot;laas&quot; (λάας) meaning &quot;rock&quot;, and the Pelasgic ending &quot;sos&quot; (σος). The Penteli Mountain was named that way because of the great white stones and beautiful marbles mined out and used for the magnificent world-renowned monuments of Acropolis in antiquity (as well as for the modern buildings of the 19th century in Athens), before the Great Penteli Abbey being set at the foot of the mountain in 1576 by the bishop of Evripos, Timotheos Mentelis.

The word &quot;Vrilissia&quot; is a plural form of a neuter noun (τα Βριλήσσια) referring to the land of the Great Rock Mountain (Penteli). The word is pronounced as &quot;Vri-lί-ssi-a&quot;. The Greek form for Municipality of Vrilissia is &quot;Δήμος Βριλησσίων&quot;.

The city&#x27;s logo depicts a well known ancient Greek trove, whereas a boulder representing the municipality&#x27;s megalith-shaped form is placed at the main park of the city (Eleftherias Square, meaning Square of Freedom).

==Features==

Vrilissia is an affluent suburb with several schools spanning all grades, sporting grounds and parks; it is also home to a large commercial district with a number of banks and several malls within its territory. Two popular centres of activity are the two main squares, &quot;Plateia Iroon&quot; or Iroon Square and &quot;Plateia Analipseos&quot; or Analipseos Square, recently renovated and hosting several small coffee shops. Vrilissia has exceptionally wide, straight roads, in stark contrast to those typically found in Athens, and is also relatively green, with most houses/apartment blocks extending to gardens.

Vrilissia has a popular men&#x27;s handball team, competing in the A1 league.

== Vrilissia suburban forest ==

The administrative limits of the city at around 1950–1970 reached up to the foothills of the Pentelikon Mountain. In particular, the residential part at the urban design of the suburb in the old days reached to the peripheral road of Penteli, Anapafseos&#x27;s Avenue. Over that avenue the woodland of Patima Hill (Footing Hill) spread, on which the Metamorphoseos tou Sotiros (Jesus Christ Savior&#x27;s Metamorphosis) church was set, as well as a small space with pits placed for the neighbouring marble workshops. This space was progressively shaped for the settlement of the Vrilissia Municipal Damari (Pit) Theatre of Aliki Vougiouklaki.

At that time, Penteli constituted a popular destination for day excursions for Athenians, as well as picnics, walks in the forest, a stop for a coffee, or dinner at the local taverns. Despite the natural wealth of the mountain, it was never characterised as a &quot;National Forest&quot;, as was the case with the neighbouring Parnitha Mountain, largely due to the landholding muniments of the Penteli Abbey since the 16th century, often sold or adopted by local mountaineer graziers working at the abbey&#x27;s farm-lands, before the constitution of the modern Greek state.. When urban housing projects began reaching Halandri, Vrilissia and Melissia, Penteli started to transform into a residential landscape. Features that had long started to creep in, since the time of the monks, the Sarakatsaneoi graziers and the Doukissa of Plakentia who lived there since the 18th century. The gradual rise in value of the region, caused by the build-up of the area, triggered individual or association claims, while the available pieces of land at the main Vrilissia area were rapidly taken up.

When the Penteli town plan began to take form, the claims increased, both in volume and intensity. Courts began to vindicate individual and association claims with a legal base of &quot;good fidelity&quot;, and &quot;usucaption&quot;. Vrilissia kept expanding into the hill, while it saw losses from each of its sides from the neighbouring suburbs of Melissia, New and Old Penteli. Around this time and in stark contrast to the lower-density provisions afforded for the Ano Vrilissia settlement below the Anapafseos Avenue, the hill was allowed multi-floor apartment blocks (up to five levels), in the process compromising the aesthetics of the Penteliko scenery.

The hill was residented during a period when the cadastre and the distinction of the urban and forestry areas were at a primal stage (and still are in 2007 for Greece). The south area of the hill looking at the Athens basin was included in the urban design of Vrilissia and the street layout approved was implemented. However, at the east of the Patima of Vrilissia residential settlement, beyond the steep Kalavriton (Kalavrita) Street, still lies a forestry area that has not been recognized nor by the plan of Vrilissia, neither by Penteli. This area is known as &quot;Krassas Settlement&quot;, which has been a point of scepticism for the various municipal authorities that governed the suburb. The need for applying the law often stumbled at social dilemmas, with resulted to the few residents of the settlement being cut away from any form of transportation or other urban convenience applied, but with the municipality also being unable to utilise part of its forestry heritage. This area amounts roughly to , of which the 0.010 are inhabited. The latest proposals of the municipal council suggested concession of per household to those who abide by the criteria of the law (that allocate titles of purchase of the land inhabited). The municipality, according to the same proposal, claims the remaining indisposed land at the region of plus those that in collaboration with the forestry service of Penteli will be declared as forestry. As a result of the above, a few months before the summer of 2007 it had been forecast that of forestry land would be acquired and utilised by the municipality. Still, some local papers forecast negative events, as this would stimulate the appetite of many.

Finally, a pine-clad area of was preserved around the northern borders of the municipality, up to the neighbouring suburbs and reaching the Halandri gullies to the south, a natural protection of the city from the traffic and exhaust. The climate of Vrilissia has always been exceptional in a &quot;cement city&quot; as some parts of Athens are often characterized. Even today, with the important new transportation projects built, and the trading development, Vrilissia&#x27;s climate is still considered to be clean, offering ideal conditions of living to its residents.
Nevertheless, during the last years many unfortunate incidents have threatened this particular feature of the region.

In the means of the 2000s (decade), members of the Building Association &quot;Agios Theoklitos&quot; (Saint Theoklitos) are introduced as owners of large pieces of the Patima forested land to the west of the Vrilissia built area (near the Penteli Avenue), claiming that their association bought this piece of land in 1965 from the Penteli Abbey. However, the Court of First Instance of Athens (Πολυμελές Πρωτοδικείο Αθηνών) by the 3537/2001 decision indicated that the Greek state was the owner of the &quot;sub judice&quot; piece of land, for the Penteli Abbey had never been the owner of the sold to the Association. For another individual claim of 9.713 m 2 at the same geographic region, the Court on the 7319/2005 decision indicated that at the same the individual had bought the sub judice piece of land at an auction sale (December 20, 1971) by the Penteli Abbey for 2,980,000 drachmas (δραχμές). The thought prevailed in the court was that the wide region of &quot;Gerotsakouli&quot; (Γεροτσακούλι) had been owned by the abbey since its foundation in 1578 by Saint Timotheos Mentelis, Bishop of Evripos partially by donations from devout Christians and by purchase in 1600 by the Ottoman from Karystos of Evia named Kagadis with muniments that were destroyed during the Greek liberation by the army of Omer Vryonis.

The recorded suggestions of the Greek state that the &quot;sub judice&quot; piece of land was characterized as forested since 1836 and that it constituted part of a wider region that came under its ownership by the Treaty of Konstantinoupoli on account of the &quot;final distinction of the Greek borders&quot; and by the 1830 protocols of London, as successor of the Turkish State, were not accepted by the court. On the contrary, the court decided that the Abbey from 1600 until 1955 owned in good faith those parts (among the rest) and became owner of this piece of public property on usucaption, since also public property may come under private ownership as long as this piece of property is used for 30 consecutive years in good faith, which was completed on 9/11 1915. However, it only until the July 2007 that the Appellate reached a verdict on the same case which vindicated the individual claims on the same argument and which did not even accept the procedural intervention of the Municipality at the Court. This particular verdict constitutes a critical decision for the irrevocable examination of the substance of the case because even attempting to exercise recantation would only affect jurisprudential matters of the case and not the substance of the verdict. In each case, however, the Greek state and the municipality are expected to examine any possible legal means left.

On June 29, 2007, only a few weeks after the announcement of the verdict and the refusal of the municipality to accept it, a great fire burst at that specific region, while the fire service was scattered around other great fires all over Greece. Fires consumed several residential buildings and forests, with the blaze lasting during the evening hours and drawing to an end following that. Another fire spread later in the summer, on August 16, 2007, and consumed tens more houses as flames spread on dry grass; if this had been removed, fire would not have spread to buildings. The conflagration entered the settlement in the evening hours. Firefighters arrived to battle the flames along with firetrucks, helicopters and airplanes. The fire burnt for several hours and ended at night. It is only some weeks after the black-letter day, the Great Parnitha Mountain was partially destroyed that this incident came to light. The government fights against the fire and manages to control it with the help of the residents only a few hours before the light comes down. However, that&#x27;s not the end of the dark summer of 2007 that such incidents happen. The Vrilissia gully is also struck while evidence of arson is found. Even the great Naval Base, a junction of interests, is struck, although the greater part of its reformation project to turn it into a park is completed. Some days afterwards, Nea Penteli and the northern district of Melissia are also struck, while the Marousi Municipality rushes to characterize the great Syggros Park as &quot;Syggros Forest&quot; as smaller incidents of fire take place there. Adjacent Municipalities with forest heritage begin volunteer projects of surveillance by residents (such as Pefki and Vrilissia) while the Chalandri gully is also struck, only a few metres away from the local fire brigade department. The incidents around Attica are numerous (Kalivia Thorikou, Keratea, Imittos and Panio forests etc.) at the same time other Greek peripheries are in danger.

==Sports==
Vrilissia is the seat of two clubs with Panhellenic titles (championships or cups). ESN Vrilissia (Ekpolitistikos Omilos Neon Vrilissia) has won three titles in Greek Handball competitions and FO Vrilissia (Filathlitikos Omilos Vrilissia) has won titles in Women Volleyball Competitions.

<text>HMS &quot;Jersey&quot; was a J-class destroyer of the Royal Navy.

==Construction and career==
On 25 March 1937, the British Admiralty placed orders for the eight destroyers of the J class, including one ship, &quot;Jersey&quot; to be built by J. Samuel White and Company at Cowes on the Isle of Wight. &quot;Jersey&quot; was laid down on 20 September 1937 and launched on 26 September 1938. &quot;Jersey&quot; was commissioned on 28 April 1939.

Following commissioning, &quot;Jersey&quot; worked up at Portland through to July 1939. On 12 August 1939, &quot;Jersey&quot; joined the Seventh Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet, based at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands.

===7 December 1939===
&quot;Jersey&quot; was torpedoed off Haisborough Sands by the , which was returning unseen from laying a minefield. Ten of the ship&#x27;s company were killed and extensive damage caused. &quot;Jersey&quot; was towed to the Humber for repairs and did not return to her flotilla until 28 October 1940.

===2 May 1941===
&quot;Jersey&quot; struck an Italian aircraft-dropped mine off Malta&#x27;s Grand Harbour and sank next to the Grand Harbour breakwater. Thirty-five crew members were killed.

When &quot;Jersey&quot; sank it blocked the entrance to Malta&#x27;s Grand Harbour, meaning movements into and out of the harbour were impossible for several days. The destroyers , and were left marooned in the harbour until the wreck was cleared. Some of the ships that rescued the surviving crew had to take passage to Gibraltar. On 5 May the wreck broke into two sections. It was only after 1946 that the after section was cleared from the entrance, in a series of controlled demolitions carried out between 1946 and 1949. Further salvage and clearance work was done in 1968 to make the harbour safe for large vessels.

==About the wreck==
* Ship sunk at: Valletta, Malta
* Position: 35° 54&#x27;N, 14° 30&#x27;E
* Depth (m.): 19 max. / 15.8 min.

;Kannon Rock
* A rock that stands 30 meters high above the deep blue ocean and resembles the image of the goddess Kannon. In 1638, during the revolt of Shimabara, it is said that a man named Amenomori Kudayu was sent to quell the uprest but was injured in battle and retreated with his men by ship. His condition deteriorated, and while there were no lighthouses at the time, it is said that the crew headed towards a light that was coming from Kashiwajima. When the ship approached Kannon Rock, Kudayu died from his wounds, and at that moment a beam of light radiated from Kannon Rock. Since then, the rock has been thought to be sacred.

;Monkey Park
* The , overlooking the beautiful Ōdō Kaigan, is open year-round. The monkeys are friendly, but care should always be taken when feeding them. Feed is available for \200, and the park is closed on Mondays. When Monday is a holiday, the park is instead closed on the next regular weekday.

;Oman&#x27;s Waterfall
* Along the same hiking trail that passes by &quot;Kannon Rock&quot; is a cliff called Oman Taki. Despite being called a waterfall, there is no running water; locals use the word &quot;taki&quot; (滝, literally &quot;waterfall&quot;) to mean &quot;cliff&quot;. There once was a beautiful blind woman named Oman who fell in love with a man whose job it was to protect the island (most likely a samurai of higher social class). Oman thought of this man&#x27;s job as an important role and somewhat became obsessed with him, but when she realized this love could never be, she decided to throw herself from the edge of this cliff and plummeted to her death approximately 120 m to the ocean below. The exact date is unknown, but eventually the cliff came to be known as Oman&#x27;s Waterfall in memory of this tragic story.

;Tsukiyama Shrine
* Tsukiyama Shrine, which has a thousand years of history, is located on Mt. Moritsuki. It is believed to have been a shrine where Kūkai performed ascetic practices. As a former center of Shugendō training, it is visited by a great number of people from all over the country. The coastal area near a temple called &quot;Ōtsukinada&quot; used to be famous for pink corals, and it is believed to be the first place where corals were gathered for living. In recent years parties of pilgrims have been using well-paved roads. However, the local people founded a group called the Association for the Preservation of the Pilgrimage Route to restore such routes to their original state for the first time in 40 years. The routes run through mountains and seacoasts.

In the modern day, this ritual is carried out every year on January 2, and includes elders making offerings at several locations in the village while young men sit waiting outside wearing only simple yukatas. When the elders come out, they douse the young men with bucket after bucket of cold sea water, and the procession moves on to the next location of prayer.

<text>Operation Cobra was an offensive launched by the First United States Army under Lieutenant General Omar Bradley seven weeks after the D-Day landings, during the Normandy campaign of World War II. The intention was to take advantage of the distraction of the Germans by the British and Canadian attacks around Caen in Operation Goodwood, and thereby break through the German defenses that were penning in their forces, while the Germans were unbalanced. Once a corridor had been created, the First Army would then be able to advance into Brittany, rolling up the German flanks once free of the constraints of the bocage country. After a slow start, the offensive gathered momentum and German resistance collapsed as scattered remnants of broken units fought to escape to the Seine. Lacking the resources to cope with the situation, the German response was ineffectual mainly due to the effect of Operation Bluecoat and the entire Normandy front soon collapsed. Operation Cobra, together with concurrent offensives by the British Second Army and the Canadian First Army, was decisive in securing an Allied victory in the Normandy campaign.

Having been delayed several times by poor weather, Operation Cobra commenced on 25 July 1944, with a concentrated aerial bombardment from thousands of Allied aircraft. Supporting offensives had drawn the bulk of German armored reserves toward the British and Canadian sector and, coupled with the general lack of men and materiel available to the Germans, it was impossible for them to form successive lines of defense. Units of the U.S. VII Corps led the initial two-division assault, while other First U.S. Army corps mounted supporting attacks designed to pin German units in place. Progress was slow on the first day but opposition started to crumble once the defensive crust had been broken. By 27 July, most organized resistance had been overcome and the VII and VIII Corps advanced rapidly, isolating the Cotentin Peninsula.

By 31 July, XIX Corps had destroyed the last forces opposing the First Army, which emerged from the bocage. Reinforcements were moved west by Field Marshal Günther von Kluge and employed in various counterattacks, the largest of which, &quot;Unternehmen Lüttich&quot; (Operation Liège), was launched on 7August between Mortain and Avranches. Although this led to the bloodiest phase of the battle, it was mounted by already exhausted and understrength units and was a costly failure. On 8August, troops of the newly activated Third United States Army captured the city of Le Mans, formerly the German 7th Army headquarters. Operation Cobra transformed the high-intensity infantry combat of Normandy into rapid maneuver warfare and led to the creation of the Falaise pocket and the loss of the German strategic position in northwestern France.

==Background==

Following the successful Allied invasion of Normandy on 6June 1944, progress inland was slow. To facilitate the Allied build-up in France and to secure room for further expansion, the deep water port of Cherbourg on the western flank of the U.S. sector and the historic town of Caen in the British and Canadian sector to the east, were early objectives. The original plan for the Normandy campaign envisioned strong offensive efforts in both sectors, in which the Second Army (Lieutenant-General Sir Miles Dempsey) would secure Caen and the area south of it and the First U.S. Army (Lieutenant General Omar Bradley) would &quot;wheel round&quot; to the Loire valley.

General Sir Bernard Montgomery—commanding all Allied ground forces in Normandy—intended Caen to be taken on D-Day, while Cherbourg was expected to fall 15 days later. The Second Army was to seize Caen and then form a front to the southeast, extending to Caumont-l&#x27;Éventé, to acquire airfields and protect the left flank of the First U.S. Army as it moved on Cherbourg. Possession of Caen and its surroundings—desirable for open terrain that would permit maneuver warfare—would also give the Second Army a suitable staging area for a push south to capture Falaise, which could be used as the pivot for a swing east to advance on Argentan and then the Touques River. The capture of Caen has been described by the British official historian Lionel Ellis as the most important D-Day objective assigned to the British I Corps (Lieutenant-General John Crocker). Ellis and Chester Wilmot called the Allied plan &quot;ambitious&quot; since the Caen sector contained the strongest defenses in Normandy.
The initial attempt by I Corps to reach the city on D-Day was blocked by elements of the 21st Panzer Division and with the Germans committing most of the reinforcements sent to meet the invasion to the defense of Caen, the Anglo-Canadian front rapidly congealed short of the Second Army&#x27;s objectives. Operation Perch in the week following D-Day and Operation Epsom (26–30 June) brought some territorial gains and depleted its defenders but Caen remained in German hands until Operation Charnwood (7–9 July), when the Second Army managed to take the northern part of the city up to the River Orne in a frontal assault.
The successive Anglo-Canadian offensives around Caen kept the best of the German forces in Normandy, including most of the armor, to the eastern end of the Allied lodgement but even so the First U.S. Army made slow progress against dogged German resistance. In part, operations were slow due to the constraints of the bocage landscape of densely packed banked hedgerows, sunken lanes and small woods, for which U.S. units had not trained. With no ports in Allied hands, all reinforcement and supply had to take place over the beaches via the two Mulberry harbors and were at the mercy of the weather.

On 19 June, a severe storm descended on the English Channel, lasting for three days and causing significant delays to the Allied build-up and the cancellation of some operations. The First U.S. Army advance in the western sector was eventually halted by Bradley before the town of Saint-Lô, to concentrate on the seizure of Cherbourg. The defense of Cherbourg consisted largely of four German battlegroups formed from the remnants of units that had retreated up the Cotentin Peninsula, but the port defenses had been designed principally to meet an attack from the sea. Organized German resistance finally ended on 27 June, when the U.S. 9th Infantry Division managed to reduce the defenses of Cap de la Hague, north-west of the port. Within four days, VII Corps (Major General J. Lawton Collins) resumed the offensive toward Saint-Lô, alongside XIX Corps and VIII Corps, causing the Germans to move more armor into the U.S. sector.

==Planning==

The originator of the idea for Operation Cobra is disputed. According to Montgomery&#x27;s official biographer, the foundation of Operation Cobra was laid on 13 June. Planning was immensely aided by detailed Ultra intelligence which supplied up-to-date decodes of communications between &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (OKW, the German armed forces high command) and Hitler&#x27;s generals. Montgomery&#x27;s plan at that time called for the U.S. First Army to take Saint-Lô and Coutances and then make two southward thrusts; one from Caumont toward Vire and Mortain and the other from Saint-Lô toward Villedieu and Avranches. Although pressure was to be kept up along the Cotentin Peninsula towards La Haye-du-Puits and Valognes, the capture of Cherbourg was not the priority. With the capture of Cherbourg by VII Corps on 27 June, Montgomery&#x27;s initial timetable was overtaken by events and the thrust from Caumont was never adopted.

Following the conclusion of Operation Charnwood and the cancellation of the First Army offensive towards Saint-Lô, Montgomery met with Bradley and Dempsey on 10 July to discuss plans for the 21st Army Group. Bradley said that progress on the western flank was very slow but that plans had been laid for another breakout attempt, codenamed Operation Cobra, to be launched by the First Army on 18 July. Montgomery approved the plan and that the strategy would remain the diversion of German attention from the First Army to the British and Canadian sector. Dempsey was instructed to &quot;go on hitting, drawing the German strength, especially the armour, onto yourself—so as to ease the way for Brad&quot;. To accomplish this, Operation Goodwood was planned and Eisenhower ensured that both operations would have the support of the Allied strategic bombers.
On 12 July, Bradley briefed his commanders on the Cobra plan, which consisted of three phases. The main effort would be under the control of VII Corps. In the first phase, the breakthrough attack would be conducted by the 9th Infantry Division (Major General Manton S. Eddy) and the 30th Infantry Division (Major General Leland Hobbs), which would break into the German defensive zone and then hold the flanks of the penetration while the 1st Infantry Division (Major General Clarence Huebner) and 2nd Armored Division (Major General Edward H. Brooks) pushed into the depth of the position until resistance collapsed. The 1st Infantry Division &quot;was to take Marigny, with this objective exploited by a stream of General Watson&#x27;s 3rd Armored Division armor that would move south toward Coutances&quot;. The 2nd Armored Division—part of &quot;Collins&#x27; exploitation force&quot; of the 2nd Armored Division in the east of the VII Corps sector and the &quot;1st Infantry Division reinforced by Combat Command B (CCB) of the 3rd Armored division in the west&quot;—would &quot;pass through the 30th Infantry Division sector... and guard the overall American left flank.&quot; If VII Corps succeeded, the western German position would become untenable, permitting a relatively easy advance to the southwest end of the bocage to cut off and seize the Brittany peninsula. First Army intelligence estimated that no German counterattack would occur in the first few days after Cobra&#x27;s launch and that if they did later, they would be no more than battalion-sized operations.

Cobra was to be a concentrated attack on a front, unlike previous U.S. broad front offensives and would have a mass of air support. Fighter-bombers would concentrate on hitting forward German defenses in a belt immediately south of the Saint-Lô–Periers road, while General Spaatz&#x27;s heavy bombers would bomb to a depth of behind the German main line of resistance. It was anticipated that the physical destruction and shock value of a short, intense preliminary bombardment would greatly weaken the German defense so in addition to divisional artillery, Army- and Corps-level units would provide support, including nine heavy, five medium and seven light artillery battalions. More than a thousand divisional and corps artillery pieces were committed to the offensive and approximately 140,000 artillery rounds were allocated to the operation in VII Corps, with another 27,000 for VIII Corps.

To overcome the constraints of the bocage that had made attacks so difficult and costly for both sides, Rhino modifications were made to some M4 Sherman, M5A1 Stuart tanks and M10 tank destroyers, by fitting them with hedge-breaching &#x27;tusks&#x27; that could force a path through hedgerows. German tanks remained restricted to the roads but U.S. armored vehicles could maneuver more freely, although the effectiveness of the devices was exaggerated. By the eve of Cobra, 60 percent of the tanks of the First Army had the rhino modification. To preserve operational security, Bradley forbade their use until Cobra was launched. In all, 1,269 M4 medium tanks, 694 M5A1 light tanks and 288 M10 tank destroyers were available.

===Supporting operations===


On 18 July, the British VIII and I Corps—to the east of Caen—launched Operation Goodwood. The offensive began with the largest air bombardment in support of ground forces yet, with more than 1,000 aircraft dropping of high explosive and fragmentation bombs from low altitude. German positions to the east of Caen were shelled by 400 artillery pieces and many villages were reduced to rubble but German artillery further to the south, on the Bourguébus Ridge, was outside the range of the British artillery and the defenders of Cagny and Émiéville were largely unscathed by the bombardment. This contributed to the losses suffered by Second Army, which sustained over 4,800 casualties. Principally an armored offensive in order to conserve infantry manpower, between 250 and 400 British tanks were put out of action, although recent examination suggests that only 140 were completely destroyed with an additional 174 damaged. The operation remains the largest tank battle ever fought by the British Army and resulted in the expansion of the Orne bridgehead and the capture of Caen on the south bank of the Orne.

Simultaneously, the II Canadian Corps on the western flank of Goodwood began Operation Atlantic to strengthen the Allied foothold along the banks of the Orne river and take Verrières Ridge to the south of Caen. Atlantic made initial gains but ran out of steam as casualties mounted. Having cost the Canadians 1,349 men and with the heavily defended ridge firmly in German hands, Atlantic was closed down on 20 July. At Montgomery&#x27;s urging, &quot;strongly underlined in the Supreme Commander&#x27;s communications to Montgomery&quot;, the II Canadian Corps commander, Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds, began a second offensive a few days later, codenamed Operation Spring. This had the limited but important aim of tying down German units to prevent them from being transferred to the U.S. sector, although Simonds took the opportunity to make another bid for Verrières Ridge. Again the fighting for Verrières Ridge proved extremely bloody for the Canadians, with 25 July marking the costliest day for a Canadian battalion—The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada—since the Dieppe Raid of 1942. A counterstroke by two German divisions pushed the Canadians back past their start lines and Simonds had to commit reinforcements to stabilize the front. With Goodwood, the Canadian operations caused the Germans to commit most of their armor and reinforcements to the eastern sector. Operation Spring—despite its cost—had drawn the 9th SS Panzer Division away from the U.S. sector on the eve of Operation Cobra. Only two &quot;Panzer&quot; divisions with 190 tanks now faced the First Army. Seven &quot;Panzer&quot; divisions with 750 tanks were around Caen, far away from Operation Cobra as were all the heavy Tiger tank battalions and the three &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; brigades in Normandy.

===Logistics===

Each division consumed of supplies daily.

==Allied offensive==
===Preliminary attacks===

To gain good terrain for Operation Cobra, Bradley and Collins conceived a plan to push forward to the Saint-Lô–Periers road, along which VII and VIII Corps were securing jumping-off positions. On 18 July, at a cost of 5,000 casualties, the U.S. 29th and 35th Infantry Divisions managed to gain the vital heights of Saint-Lô, driving back &quot;General der Fallschirmtruppen&quot; Eugen Meindl&#x27;s II Parachute Corps. Meindl&#x27;s paratroopers, together with the 352nd Infantry Division (which had been in action since its D-Day defense of Omaha Beach) were now in ruins, and the stage for the main offensive was set. Due to poor weather conditions that had also been hampering Goodwood and Atlantic, Bradley decided to postpone Cobra for a few days—a decision that worried Montgomery, as the British and Canadian operations had been launched to support a breakout attempt that was failing to materialize. By 24 July the skies had cleared enough for the start order to be given, and 1,600 Allied aircraft took off for Normandy. However, the weather closed in again over the battlefield. Under poor visibility conditions, more than 25 Americans were killed and 130 wounded in the bombing before the air support operation was postponed until the following day. Some enraged soldiers opened fire on their own aircraft, a not uncommon practice in Normandy when suffering from friendly fire.

===Main attack and breakthrough 25–27 July===

After the one-day postponement, Cobra got underway at 09:38 on 25 July, when around 600 Allied fighter-bombers attacked strongpoints and enemy artillery along a -wide strip of ground located in the St. Lô area. For the next hour, 1,800 heavy bombers of the U.S. Eighth Air Force saturated a area on the Saint-Lô–Periers road, succeeded by a third and final wave of medium bombers. Approximately 3,000 U.S. aircraft had carpet-bombed a narrow section of the front, with the &quot;Panzer-Lehr-Division&quot; taking the brunt of the attack. However, once again not all the casualties were German; Bradley had specifically requested that the bombers approach the target from the east, out of the sun and parallel to the Saint-Lô–Periers road, in order to minimize the risk of friendly losses, but most of the airmen instead came in from the north, perpendicular to the front line. Bradley, however, had apparently misunderstood explanations from the heavy bomber commanders that a parallel approach was impossible because of the time and space constraints Bradley had set. Additionally, a parallel approach would not in any event have assured that all bombs would fall behind German lines because of deflection errors or obscured aim points due to dust and smoke. Despite efforts by U.S. units to identify their positions, inaccurate bombing by the Eighth Air Force killed 111 men and wounded 490. The dead included Bradley&#x27;s friend and fellow West Pointer Lieutenant General Lesley McNair—the highest-ranking U.S. soldier to be killed in action in the European Theater of Operations.

By 11:00, the infantry began to move forward, advancing from crater to crater beyond what had been the German outpost line. Although no serious opposition was forecast, the remnants of Fritz Bayerlein&#x27;s &quot;Panzer Lehr&quot;—consisting of roughly 2,200 men and 45 armored vehicles—had regrouped and were prepared to meet the advancing U.S. troops, and to the west of &quot;Panzer Lehr&quot; the German 5th Parachute Division had escaped the bombing almost intact. Collins&#x27; VII Corps were quite disheartened to meet fierce enemy artillery fire, which they expected to have been suppressed by the bombing. Several U.S. units found themselves entangled in fights against strongpoints held by a handful of German tanks, supporting infantry and guns—VII Corps gained only during the rest of the day. However, if the first day&#x27;s results had been disappointing, General Collins found cause for encouragement; although the Germans were fiercely holding their positions, these did not seem to form a continuous line and were susceptible to being outflanked or bypassed. Even with prior warning of the U.S. offensive, the British and Canadian actions around Caen had convinced the Germans that the real threat lay there, and tied down their available forces to such an extent that a succession of meticulously prepared defensive positions in depth, as encountered during Goodwood and Atlantic, were not created to meet Cobra.
On the morning of 26 July, the U.S. 2nd Armored Division and the 1st Infantry Division joined the attack as planned, reaching one of Cobra&#x27;s first objectives—a road junction north of Le Mesnil-Herman—the following day. Also on 26 July, VIII Corps (Major General Troy H. Middleton) entered the battle, led by the 8th U.S. Infantry Division and 90th U.S. Infantry Division. Despite clear paths of advance through the floods and swamps across their front, both divisions initially disappointed the First Army by failing to gain significant ground but first light the next morning revealed that the Germans had been compelled to retreat by their crumbling left flank, leaving only immense minefields to delay VIII Corps. By noon on 27 July, the U.S. 9th Infantry Division was also clear of any organized German resistance and was advancing rapidly.

===Breakout and advance 28–30 July===

By 28 July, the German defenses across the U.S. front had largely collapsed under the full weight of the VII and VIII Corps advance and resistance was disorganized and patchy. The 4th Armored Division (VIII Corps)—entering combat for the first time—captured Coutances but met stiff opposition east of the town and U.S. units penetrating into the depth of the German positions were counter-attacked by elements of the 2nd SS Panzer Division, 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division and the 353rd Infantry Division, seeking to escape entrapment. Around Roncey, P-47 Thunderbolts of the 405th Fighter Group destroyed a German column of 122 tanks, 259 other vehicles and 11 artillery pieces. An attack by British Hawker Typhoon fighter-bombers close to La Baleine destroyed ninetanks, eightother armored vehicles and 20 other vehicles. A counter-attack was mounted against the U.S. 2nd Armored Division by German remnants but this was a disaster and the Germans abandoned their vehicles and fled on foot. Two columns of the 2nd SS Panzer Division were mauled by the U.S. 2nd Armored Division. A column around La Chapelle was bombarded at point blank range by 2nd Armored Division artillery. In two hours, U.S. artillery fired over 700 rounds, into the column. The Germans suffered the loss of 50 dead, 60 wounded and 197 taken prisoner. Material losses were over 260 German combat vehicles destroyed. Beyond the town another 1,150 German soldiers were killed and the Germans lost 96 armored combat vehicles and trucks. The U.S. 2nd Armored Division destroyed 64 German tanks and 538 other German combat vehicles during Operation Cobra. The U.S. 2nd Armored Division suffered 49 tank losses in the process. The 2nd Armored Division also inflicted over 7,370 casualties on the Germans while suffering 914 casualties. At the beginning of Operation Cobra the German Panzer Lehr Division had only 2,200 combat troops, 12 Panzer IV and 16 Panthers fit for action and 30 tanks in various states of repair behind the lines. Panzer Lehr was in the path of Allied bombing that consisted of 1,500 bombers. The division suffered about 1,000 casualties during this bombardment. An exhausted and demoralized Bayerlein reported that his &quot;Panzer Lehr Division&quot;, which had been ground down in the fighting against the British in June and before moving to the American front and suffering further losses around St Lo at start of July, was &quot;finally annihilated&quot;, with its armor wiped out, its personnel either casualties or missing and all headquarters records lost.
Field Marshal Günther von Kluge &quot;Oberbefehlshaber West&quot; (commander of German forces on the Western Front)—was mustering reinforcements, and elements of the 2nd Panzer Division and the 116th Panzer Division were approaching the battlefield. The U.S. XIX Corps (Major General Charles H. Corlett) entered the battle on 28 July on the left of VII Corps and between 28 and 31 July became embroiled with these reinforcements in the fiercest fighting since Cobra began. During the night of 29/30 July near Saint-Denis-le-Gast, to the east of Coutances, elements of the 2nd Armored Division found themselves fighting for their lives against a German column from the 2nd SS Panzer Division and 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division, which passed through the U.S. lines in the darkness. Other elements of the 2nd Armored Division were attacked near Cambry and fought for six hours; Bradley and his commanders knew that they were dominating the battlefield and such desperate assaults were no threat to the U.S. position. When ordered to concentrate his division, Colonel Heinz Günther Guderian the senior staff officer of the 116th Panzer Division was frustrated by the high level of Allied fighter-bomber activity. Without receiving direct support from the 2nd Panzer Division as promised, Guderian stated that his panzergrenadiers could not succeed in a counterattack against the Americans. Advancing southward along the coast, later that day, the U.S. VIII Corps seized the town of Avranches—described by historian Andrew Williams as &quot;the gateway to Brittany and southern Normandy&quot;—and by 31 July XIX Corps had thrown back the last German counterattacks after fierce fighting, inflicting heavy losses in men and tanks. The U.S. advance was now relentless, and the First Army was finally free of the bocage.

===Operation Bluecoat, 30 July – 7 August===

On 30 July, to protect Cobra&#x27;s flank and prevent the disengagement and relocation of further German forces, VIII Corps and XXX Corps of the Second Army began Operation Bluecoat southwards from Caumont toward Vire and Mont Pinçon. Bluecoat kept German armored units fixed on the British eastern front and continued the wearing down of the strength of German armored formations in the area. The breakthrough in the center of the Allied front surprised the Germans, when they were distracted by the Allied attacks at both ends of the Normandy bridgehead. By the time of the U.S. breakout at Avranches, there was little to no reserve strength left for &quot;Unternehmen Lüttich&quot;, which had been defeated by 12 August, leaving the 7th Army with no choice but to retire rapidly east of the Orne river, with a rearguard of the remaining armored and motorized units, to allow time for the surviving infantry to reach the Seine. After the first stage of the withdrawal beyond the Orne, the maneuver collapsed for a lack of fuel, Allied air attacks and the constant pressure of the Allied armies, culminating in the encirclement of German forces in the Falaise pocket.

==Aftermath==

At noon on 1 August, the U.S. Third Army was activated under the command of Lieutenant General George S. Patton. Lieutenant General Courtney Hodges assumed command of the First Army and Bradley was promoted to the overall command of both armies, named the U.S. 12th Army Group. Patton wrote a poem containing the words,
The U.S. advance following Cobra was extraordinarily rapid. Between 1and 4August, seven divisions of Patton&#x27;s Third Army had swept through Avranches and over the bridge at Pontaubault into Brittany. The Westheer (German army in the west) had been reduced to such a poor state by the Allied offensives that, with no prospect of reinforcement in the wake of Operation Bagration, the Soviet summer offensive against Army Group Centre, very few Germans believed they could now avoid defeat. Rather than order his remaining forces to withdraw to the Seine, Adolf Hitler sent a directive to von Kluge demanding &quot;an immediate counterattack between Mortain and Avranches&quot; (&quot;Unternehmen Lüttich&quot;) to &quot;annihilate&quot; the enemy and make contact with the west coast of the Cotentin peninsula. Eight of the nine Panzer divisions in Normandy were to be used in the attack but only four (one of them incomplete) could be relieved from their defensive tasks and assembled in time. German commanders immediately protested that such an operation was impossible given their remaining resources but these objections were overruled and the counter-offensive commenced, on 7August around Mortain. The 2nd, 1st SS and 2nd SS Panzer Divisions led the assault, although with only 75 Panzer IVs, 70 Panthers and 32 self-propelled guns. Hopelessly optimistic, the offensive was over within 24 hours, although fighting continued until 13 August.

By 8 August, the city of Le Mans—the former headquarters of the German 7th Army—had fallen to the Americans. With von Kluge&#x27;s few remaining battleworthy formations destroyed by the First Army, the Allied commanders realized that the entire German position in Normandy was collapsing. Bradley declared:

On 14 August, in conjunction with U.S. movements northward to Chambois, Canadian forces launched Operation Tractable; the Allied intention was to trap and destroy the German 7th Army and 5th Panzer Army near the town of Falaise. Five days later, the two arms of the encirclement were almost complete; the advancing U.S. 90th Infantry Division had made contact with the Polish 1st Armored Division and the first Allied units crossed the Seine at Mantes Gassicourt, while German units were fleeing eastward by any means they could find. By 22 August, the Falaise Pocket—which the Germans had been fighting desperately to keep open to allow their trapped forces to escape—was finally sealed, ending the Battle of Normandy with a major Allied victory. All German forces west of the Allied lines were now dead or in captivity and although perhaps 100,000 German troops escaped they left behind 40,000–50,000 prisoners and more than 10,000 dead. A total of 344 tanks and self-propelled guns, 2,447 soft-skinned vehicles and 252 artillery pieces were found abandoned or destroyed in the northern sector of the pocket. The Allies were able to advance freely through undefended territory and by 25 August all four Allied armies (First Canadian, Second British, First U.S., and Third U.S.) involved in the Normandy campaign were on the river Seine.

<text>Claudia Lynn Cohen (December 16, 1950 – June 15, 2007) was an American gossip columnist, socialite, and television reporter. She is credited with putting the New York Post&#x27;s Page Six gossip column on the map. The building housing the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s College of Arts and Sciences was renamed in her honor in 2008.

==Early life and education==
Claudia Cohen was born to a Jewish family, the daughter of Harriet (née Brandwein) and businessman Robert B. Cohen, the founder of Hudson News and the president of the Hudson County News Company, a magazine wholesaler. She grew up in Englewood, New Jersey, and attended the Dwight School for Girls (now the Dwight-Englewood School) and the University of Pennsylvania.

==Journalism career==
In 1977, she joined the &quot;New York Post&quot; as a reporter for its fledgling gossip column &quot;Page Six&quot;. She succeeded Neal Travis as editor of &quot;Page Six&quot; in 1978. Noted for going for the jugular, and creating a column with savvy and a sharp edge, Cohen is credited with putting Page Six on the map. Cohen left the &quot;Post&quot; in 1980 to start her own short-lived gossip column, &quot;I, Claudia&quot; (a play on words of the book title &quot;I, Claudius&quot;) at a rival newspaper, the New York Daily News. While that column was not a success, it did maintain Cohen&#x27;s profile. Cohen was a regular on &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot; and an active member of the Manhattan and Hamptons social scene.

==Death==
Cohen died on June 15, 2007, from ovarian cancer.

==Personal life==
In 1984, Cohen began a relationship with businessman Ronald Perelman. The two married in 1985, and had one daughter, Samantha. After nine years, the couple divorced, and Cohen reportedly received a settlement of $80,000,000 (eighty million U.S. dollars).

Cohen later dated former U.S. senator from New York state, Al D&#x27;Amato.

At the request of Ronald Perelman, the University of Pennsylvania renamed the historic Logan Hall, sitting next to College Hall and originally named after James Logan, secretary to William Penn, &quot;Claudia Cohen Hall,&quot; much to the surprise and dismay of some Penn faculty, alumni, and students. The rear of the newly renamed building overlooks Perelman Quadrangle.

<doc id="483473" wikidata="Q1362405" url="?curid=483473" title="Gelato">
<text>Gelato (; ) is the common word in Italian for all types of ice cream. In English, it specifically refers to a frozen dessert of Italian origin. Artisanal gelato in Italy generally contains 6–9% butterfat, which is lower than other styles of frozen dessert. Gelato typically contains 35% air (substantially less than American-style ice cream) and more flavoring than other types of frozen desserts, giving it an intense flavor with creamy, smooth texture, density and richness that distinguishes it from other ice creams.

==Name==
In Italian, means simply &#x27;frozen&#x27; and is the generic word for any type or style of ice cream. In English, however, the term has come to be used to refer to a specific style of ice cream derived from the Italian artisanal tradition.

==History==

In the 9th century, after the Muslim conquest of Sicily, frozen desserts such as sherbet were introduced on the island.

In 1295, Marco Polo returned to Venice from China with a recipe similar to sorbet.

Cosimo Ruggeri and Bernardo Buontalenti were 16th-century contemporaries who are credited by some sources with the invention of gelato, while other sources claims that Sicilian cooks gradually modified the sherbet recipe over time, giving birth to the earliest form of gelato. 

In Florence, Cosimo Ruggeri is credited with creating one of the first gelati, , at the court of Catherine de&#x27; Medici, in a competition with the theme &quot;&quot; ().

In the 1530s, Catherine de&#x27; Medici took gelato to Paris.

Around 1565, Bernardo Buontalenti, an innovator in ice conservation, made a sorbet with ice, salt, lemon, wine, milk, sugar, egg, and honey, &quot;plus orange and bergamot flavouring&quot;. Buontalenti is credited with inventing , whipped cream or egg cream gelato, the precursor to modern Florentine gelato.

In 1686, Francesco Procopio dei Coltelli, a Sicilian, brought his grandfather Francesco&#x27;s gelato-making machine to Paris, opened Café Procope and introduced the dessert. Procopio obtained French citizenship, and a royal license from Louis XIV, making him the sole producer of the frozen dessert in the kingdom. Being one of the first to sell gelato directly to the public (prior to then it was reserved only for nobles), and making it known in the rest of Europe, Procopio is sometimes referred to as &quot;the father of Italian gelato&quot;.

In 1945, in Bologna, Bruto Carpigiani began selling gelato-making equipment, and created Motogelatiera, the first automated gelato machine. The batch freezer made it easier to store frozen desserts. Carpigiani is a big manufacturer of gelato machinery.

The largest ice cream cone in the world was created in 2011 in Rimini during the 32nd edition of the International Exhibition of Handcrafted Gelato, Pastry, and Bakery. The cone, made with over 2000 wafers, was tall and weighed . Leading the team of seven artisans who accomplished the feat was the chocolatier Mirco Della Vecchia.

==Commercial production==

The process of making gelato is complex, starting with a custard base, mixed with milk and sugar, heating the ingredients to 85 °C (185 °F) for pasteurization. Then, it is lowered to 5 °C (41 °F) and mixed to the desired texture. The mixed gelato is then batched in the freezer. In the &quot;sprint&quot; process, milk or water is added to a package of ingredients which is then mixed and batched to achieve the proper consistency.

As with other ice creams, the sugar in gelato prevents it from freezing solid by binding to the water and interfering with the normal formation of ice crystals. This creates smaller ice crystals and results in the smooth texture of gelato. Commercial gelati are often sweetened with inverted sugar, sucrose, dextrose or xylitol, and may include a stabilizer such as guar gum.

==Flavors==

The original is a plain, base ice cream with no flavor and no eggs added. is gelato with chocolate chunks. Traditional flavors of gelato include (&#x27;custard&#x27;), vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, almond, and pistachio. Modern flavors include a variety of fruit flavors and also new, unexpected flavors such as extra virgin olive oil or basil.

<text>Revlon, Inc. is an American multinational company dealing in cosmetics, skin care, perfume, and personal care. The headquarters of Revlon was established in New York City on March 1, 1932, where it remains. Revlon was founded by brothers Charles and Joseph Revson, and chemist Charles Lachman. Revlon products are sold in 150 countries and the company has many global locations including Mexico City, London, Paris, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Sydney, Singapore, and Tokyo.

On June 16, 2022, Revlon filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It was emerged from bankruptcy on May 2, 2023.

==History==
===Founding and Charles Revson control (1932–1975)===
Revlon was founded in New York City on March 1, 1932, in the midst of the Great Depression, by Jewish American brothers Charles Revson and Joseph Revson along with a chemist, Charles Lachman, who contributed the &quot;L&quot; in the Revlon name. The three men started with one single product, a new type of nail enamel and pooled their resources to develop a unique manufacturing process. Using pigments instead of dyes, Revlon developed a variety of new shades of nail enamel. In 1937, Revlon started selling the polishes in department stores and pharmacies. In six short years, the company became a multimillion-dollar organization. By 1940, Revlon offered an entire manicure line and added lipstick to the collection. During World War II, Revlon created makeup and related products for the United States Army, which was honored in 1944 with the Army-Navy &quot;E&quot; Award for Excellence. 

By the end of World War II, Revlon was the number two cosmetics producer in the United States. Expanding its capabilities, the company bought &quot;Graef &amp; Schmidt&quot;, a cutlery manufacturer seized by the government in 1943 because of German business ties. This acquisition made it possible for Revlon to produce its own manicure and pedicure instruments instead of buying them from outside supply sources. 

====Stock market====
On February 28, 1996, Revlon was listed on the New York Stock Exchange as a public limited company. The IPO price was $24 per share.

==== Divisions ====

In the 1960s, Revson segmented Revlon Inc. into different divisions, each focusing on a different market. He borrowed this strategy from General Motors. Each division had its own target customer:

* Revlon, the largest and most popular-priced brand
* Princess Marcella Borghese, upscale/international
* Ultima II, premium
* Natural Wonder, juniors
* Moon Drops, dry skin
* Etherea, hypo-allergenic

====Early acquisitions ====
In 1957, Revlon acquired &quot;Knomark&quot;, a shoe-polish company, and sold its shoe-polish line Esquire Shoe Polish in 1969. Other acquisitions, such as &quot;Ty-D-Bol&quot;, the maker of toilet cleansers, and a 27 percent interest in the Schick electric shaver company, were soon discarded. Evan Picone, a women&#x27;s sportswear manufacturer with a price tag of $12 million in 1962, was sold back to one of the original partners four years later for $1 million. However, the 1967 acquisition of the U.S. Vitamin and Pharmaceutical Corporation made Revlon a leader in diabetes drugs.

The company began to market its products overseas at the end of the 1950s. By 1962, when Revlon debuted in Japan, there were subsidiaries in France, Italy, Argentina, Mexico, and Asia. In Japan Revlon used its basic U.S. advertising and models instead of adapting its advertisements and using Japanese models. Sales for 1962 came to $164 million.

In 1968, Revlon introduced Eterna27, the first cosmetic cream with an estrogen precursor called &quot;Progenitin&quot; (pregnenolone acetate). Later Revlon launched &quot;Braggi&quot; &quot;Pub,&quot; &quot;Bill Blass&quot; for men, and a line of wig maintenance products called Wig Wonder.

In 1970, Revlon acquired the Mitchum line of deodorants. In 1971, Flex shampoo and conditioner were introduced.

In 1973, Revlon introduced Charlie perfume. It was aimed at people under 30 and promoted by model Shelley Hack who was wearing trousers in the advertisements. Shelley Hack appeared on &quot;Oprah&quot; in 2007 to talk about the power of the Charlie advertisements.

After the introduction of Charlie, Revlon&#x27;s net sales figures were $506 million in 1973 and $606 million the following year. 

&quot;Jontue&quot; perfume also sold well.

Revlon also owns the perfume brand Jean Nate.

====Models====
In 1973, model Lauren Hutton signed an exclusive modeling contract, agreeing to pose for Revlon&#x27;s Ultima line for $400,000 for two years, and was portrayed on the cover of Newsweek. Richard Avedon was signed on as the exclusive photographer for the brand.

===Michel Bergerac control (1975–1985)===
In 1975, Charles Revson died. Michel Bergerac, whom Revson had hired as President of the company, continued to expand the company holdings. Revlon acquired Coburn Optical Industries, an Oklahoma-based ophthalmic and optical processing equipment and supplies manufacturer. Barnes-Hind, the largest U.S. marketer of hard contact lens solutions, was bought in 1976 and strengthened Revlon&#x27;s share of the eye-care market. Revlon purchased &quot;Armour Pharmaceutical Company&quot;, a division of Armour and Company, from The Greyhound Corporation in 1977. Other acquisitions included the Lewis-Howe Company, makers of &quot;Tums&quot; antacid in 1978. These health-care operations helped sales figures surpass the $1 billion mark in 1977, bringing total sales to $1.7 billion in 1979.

In the mid-1980s, Revlon lost ground to Estée Lauder, and Armour Pharmaceutical&#x27;s haemophilia product &quot;Factorate&quot; infected many people worldwide with HIV and hepatitis C. Estee Lauder spent millions of dollars on numerous magazine ads featuring Czech supermodel Paulina Porizkova, shot by famed Chicago fashion photographer Victor Skrebneski. Revlon&#x27;s share dropped from 20 percent to 10 percent of department store cosmetics sales. Sales at the drugstore also declined as Revlon lost shares to Noxell&#x27;s Cover Girl brand. Revlon compensated with more acquisitions; Max Factor, Ellen Betrix, Charles of the Ritz, Germaine Monteil, Almay, Fermodyl, Lancaster, Aziza, and Halston. The 1977 acquisition of &quot;Carlos Colomer&quot;, a Spanish professional beauty supply distributor, brought &quot;Fermodyl&quot; and &quot;Roux&quot; and helped introduce Revlon to the world of ethnic care: &quot;Creme of Nature&quot;, &quot;Realistic&quot;, &quot;Lovely Color&quot; and &quot;Milk and Honey&quot;. In 1983 the company attempted an unsuccessful hostile takeover of Gillette. In 1989, Revlon became one of the first companies to replace animal tests with alternative safety testing methods.

===Ronald Perelman control (since 1985)===
On November 5, 1985, at a price of $58 per share, totaling $2.7 billion, Revlon was sold to Pantry Pride (later renamed to Revlon Group, Inc.), a subsidiary of Ronald Perelman&#x27;s MacAndrews &amp; Forbes. The buyout—engineered with the help of junk bond king Michael P. Milken—saddled Revlon with a huge $2.9 billion debt load, which became an albatross around the company&#x27;s neck for years to come. Pantry Pride Inc. offered to buy any or all of Revlon&#x27;s 38.2 million outstanding shares for $47.5 a share when its street price stood at $45 a share. Initially rejected, he repeatedly raised his offer until it reached $53 a share while fighting Revlon&#x27;s management every step of the way. Forstmann Little &amp; Company swooped in at $56 a share, a brief public bidding war ensued, and Perelman triumphed with an offer of $58 a share. Perelman paid $1.8 billion to Revlon&#x27;s shareholders, but he also paid $900 million of other costs associated with the purchase. Perelman filed suit in the Delaware Court of Chancery to force Revlon to accept Perelman&#x27;s offer, and the resulting appellate decision, &quot;Revlon v. MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings&quot;, was a landmark case in determining the obligations of public company directors in hostile takeover situations under Delaware law.

Perelman had Revlon sell four divisions: two for $1 billion, the vision care division for $574 million, and the National Health Laboratories division which became a publicly owned corporation in 1988. Additional make-up lines were purchased for Revlon: Max Factor in 1987 and Betrix in 1989, later sold to Procter &amp; Gamble in 1991. Also in 1991, Revlon sold the Clean &amp; Clear brand to Johnson &amp; Johnson.

In 2011, PETA removed Revlon and other high-profile cosmetic brands from its list of companies who do not test their products on animals after the organization learned they were paying Chinese laboratories to test their cosmetics on rabbits and other animals.

In August 2013, Revlon Consumer Products Corp. bought the Colomer Group from CVC Capital Partners, a private equity firm, for $660 million.

After suffering business loss in 2011 and 2012, at the end of 2013, Revlon announced that it will exit the Chinese market, which employs 1,100 people. The business in China accounted for just 2 percent portion of net sales of Revlon&#x27;s international operations.

On November 1, 2013, Revlon named Lorenzo Delpani as president and CEO.

In March 2014, Revlon announced leaving midtown and relocate headquarters to the top two floors of One New York Plaza.

On September 22, 2014, Revlon&#x27;s board of directors elected Roberto Simon as executive vice president and chief financial officer, effective as of Sept. 30.

On April 30, 2015, Revlon completed the acquisition of U.K. based fragrance management company CBBeauty including its U.K. distributor SAS &amp; Company.

On June 16, 2016, Revlon announced its intention to purchase its competitor Elizabeth Arden, Inc. for $870 million. The acquisition was completed on September 7, 2016. Revlon also acquired Cutex from Coty Inc. in 2016.

The company announced on January 29, 2017, that CEO Fabian Garcia would leave the company at the end of February. Board member, Paul Meister, would become executive vice chairman of the board and run the day-to-day operations. A quarterly report from the end of 2017 estimated its quarterly loss falling approximately between $60 million and $80 million.

In May 2018, the company announced the appointment of Debra Perelman, the daughter of Ronald Perelman, to the position of chief executive officer. She will be the first ever female CEO of the company after serving as COO starting in January 2018 and serving on the board since 2015.

In January 2019, &quot;Seeking Alpha&quot; published an article regarding trading anomalies on the Revlon stock (REV); it is under investigation.

In August 2020, American bank Citi wrongly wired $900 million to creditors of Revlon. The wire sparked a &quot;protracted legal fight&quot;. In October of the same year, the bank was fined $400 million by the US bank regulators as a result of their risk in control systems and was ordered to update their technology.

On September 28, 2021, the UK&#x27;s Infected Blood Inquiry heard evidence about Armour&#x27;s use of hemophilia treatment products during the 1970s and 80s, which caused Hepatitis C and HIV infections, including its period under the control of Revlon Healthcare.

In October 2024, it was announced Michelle Peluso, formerly of CVS Health, Gilt Groupe, and Travelocity would be joing as CEO of the company. 

====Bankruptcy protection====
On June 16, 2022, Revlon filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after struggling with debt, rising competition, supply chain challenges, and falling behind evolving beauty standards. A few hours after the bankruptcy announcement, Revlon&#x27;s shares lost more than 13% of their value. According to a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, Revlon listed assets and liabilities between $1 billion and $10 billion. Revlon which had been managed by Perelman&#x27;s daughter Debra Perelman since mid-2018, had long-term debt of $3.31 billion as of March 31, 2022. The company narrowly avoided bankruptcy in 2020 after restructuring its debt. It was one of the last remaining holdings of Ronald Perelman. &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; reported that the company&#x27;s bankruptcy process could be &quot;complicated by financial controversies.&quot; &quot;MarketWatch&quot; quoted industry analysts and commentators as saying that bankruptcy would allow the firm a chance to refresh and regroup as it attempts to compete with newer brands, like Kylie Cosmetics or Fenty. &quot;CNBC&quot; reported that Revlon&#x27;s bankruptcy might be the start of broader bankruptcy problems for the retail sector. It was delisted from the NYSE on October 21, 2022. In December 2022, Revlon announced plans to raise $650 million in equity and transferring majority of the ownership to senior leaders. The company also announced plans to wipe out the interests of Ronald Perelman by striking an agreement with creditors to give lenders and bondholders ownership of the bankrupt cosmetics maker.

In February 2023, Revlon reached a lender settlement that would allow the company to exit from bankruptcy by April.

==Advertising==

Until the 1940s Revlon&#x27;s magazine ads were drawn by hand and mostly in black and white. In 1945, Revlon began launching full-color photographic advertisements in major magazines and stores across the country. Revlon introduced matching nail polish and lipsticks with exotic and unique names. These ads were taken by the top fashion photographers of the day including Richard Avedon, Cecil Beaton, and John Rawlings. Some of these ads were for &quot;Paint the Town Pink&quot; and 1945&#x27;s &quot;Fatal Apple&quot; with Dorian Leigh. In 1947 Revlon introduced &quot;Bachelor&#x27;s Carnation&quot; and in 1948, &quot;Sweet Talk&quot;.

In 1950, Revlon introduced a red lipstick and nail enamel called &quot;Where&#x27;s the Fire?&quot;, and later used &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; ads. One of the world&#x27;s first supermodels, Dorian Leigh, starred in some of Revlon&#x27;s most memorable advertisements of all time. In 1946, Dorian was covered in purple flowers and wrapped in a pale purple sheet for &quot;Ultra Violet.&quot; In 1947, Dorian appeared in &quot;Fashion Plate.&quot; In 1953, at the age of 36, she appeared in &quot;Cherries in the Snow.&quot; Later that year she appeared in the legendary &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; ad shot by Richard Avedon. Originally, Dorian appeared in a tight, silver-beaded dress with an enormous red wrap. Her black hair had a silver swirl in it and she had her hands, with long red nails, positioned in front of her breasts. Charles Revson rejected Avedon&#x27;s original ad as &quot;too sexual.&quot; They re-shot the ad, this time with her open hand in front of one hip, the other in front of her cheek. The advertisement became Madison Avenue legend because of the full-page quiz next to the sensual ad. Almost 50 years later, in November 2010, Revlon re-created 1953&#x27;s &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; magazine ad with actress Jessica Biel, and announced that they were issuing a limited-edition Fire and Ice lipstick and nail color, calling this campaign, &quot;lips and tips.&quot;

Dorian Leigh&#x27;s 15-years-younger red-headed sister, Suzy Parker, also shot numerous Revlon magazine ads in the 1950s. Suzy and Charles Revson, who wanted to marry Dorian at some point, despised each other. At one point, he refused to hire Suzy anymore because she complained about the &quot;peanut&quot; paycheck she received from Revlon. Richard Avedon, however, after photographing other models for a particular Revlon ad, would call in Suzy at the last minute, sometimes late at night, to do re-takes with him. This happened with &quot;Stormy Pink,&quot; an ad Suzy shot very late at night with a wild white horse in the ocean. Avedon would then tell Revson that it was not Suzy in the ad, but a model named &quot;Bubbles&quot; or another made-up name.

In 1970, Revlon became the first American cosmetics company to feature an African American model, icon Naomi Sims, in their advertising. In the late 1970s, Revlon also made history when it created their line of cosmetics, specifically for women of color, called &quot;The Polished Ambers Collection&quot; and selected fashion model icon Iman to be featured in the advertising campaigns. Revlon was also noted for featuring models of a wide age range in the 1980s, including 13-year-old Milla Jovovich and 60-year-old Audrey Hepburn. Despite the successful campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s featuring models, in particular Cindy Crawford, Revlon decided to drop fashion models and focus on movie stars, among them Kate Bosworth, Jaime King, Halle Berry, Susan Sarandon, Melanie Griffith, Julianne Moore, Eva Mendes, Jessica Alba, Jennifer Connelly, Beau Garrett, Jessica Biel, Olivia Wilde, Emma Stone and Bond girls. In 2009, Australian supermodel Elle Macpherson became one of a long line of spokesmodels for the company. American actress Jessica Biel modelled for the brand, first shown in advertisements in January 2010.

In 2008, celebrity makeup artist Gucci Westman was hired as Revlon&#x27;s Global Artistic Director, representing the company at runway shows and brand events and designing collections. In 2017, Gwen Stefani became the global ambassador of the cosmetic brand. 
In 2020, Korean-American singer, actress and fashion designer Jessica Jung was announced as the new global ambassador for the company. In 2023, the digital artist Nailea Devora became the new Revlon Global Brand Ambassador. In January 2024, Madelyn Cline became Revlon&#x27;s Global Brand Ambassador.

==Philanthropy==
Revlon is a corporate sponsor of several charity projects. The largest of these is the Revlon Run Walk, founded in 1994, in partnership with the Entertainment Industry Foundation. It is a run and walk event held in New York and Los Angeles to raise money and awareness for breast and ovarian cancer, which has raised and distributed more than $70 million to women&#x27;s cancer research and support programs since its inception. Revlon also supports other cancer charities such as Look Good Feel Better and the National Breast Cancer Coalition and operates a mobile mammography clinic in and around Oxford, North Carolina, where the company&#x27;s primary manufacturing operations are located. In 1996, Revlon supported the development of a breast center at the University of California, Los Angeles. Renamed Revlon/UCLA Breast Center, the center is a well-known institute for treatment and research of breast cancer and other breast diseases and disorders. A Revlon lip gloss shade whose proceeds support Revlon&#x27;s cancer charities was also created in 2009.

In September 2010, Revlon, with global artistic director Gucci Westman and spokesmodel Halle Berry hosted an event at Fashion&#x27;s Night Out in New York City to raise funds for the Jenesse Center, a Los Angeles organization for domestic violence victims. Revlon also hosted luncheons and various other events to benefit the center and partnered with then-online retailer drugstore.com to donate portions of lipstick sales to the organization.

In September 2015, Revlon donated $1 million through its LOVE IS ON million-dollar challenge dedicated to women&#x27;s cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. In 2016, hosted its second LOVE IS ON million-dollar challenge to raise for women&#x27;s health-related causes.

In 2018, the company launched an Employee Volunteer Program (EVP) which was created to provide each full time U.S. employee with eight hours of time to engage in community service.
