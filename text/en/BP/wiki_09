<text>Donald Roy Pettit (born April 20, 1955) is an American astronaut and chemical engineer best known for his orbital astrophotography and in-space inventions such as the Zero G Cup, which received the first ever patent for an object invented in space. He is a veteran of two long-duration stays aboard the International Space Station (with a third stay currently underway), one Space Shuttle mission, and a six-week expedition to find meteorites in Antarctica. As of 2024, at age 69, he is NASA&#x27;s oldest active astronaut.

== Early life and education ==
Pettit was born and raised in Silverton, Oregon. He is an Eagle Scout.

Pettit graduated from Oregon State University in 1978 with a Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering. He then did graduate study in chemical engineering at the University of Arizona, receiving a Ph.D. in 1983.

== NASA career ==
Pettit worked as a scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory from 1984 until 1996, when NASA selected him as an astronaut candidate. He was a junior advisor to the Synthesis Committee of the Space Exploration Initiative on its May 1991 report &quot;America at the Threshold&quot;, recommending plans for a human mission to Mars.

An astrophotographer, Pettit has captured thousands of unique star trails and photographic data sets, which he regularly shares online. One, titled &#x27;Lightning Bugs&#x27;, went viral on the internet.

=== Spaceflight experience ===
==== Expedition 6 ====

Pettit&#x27;s first space mission was as a mission specialist on STS-113 and an Expedition 6 flight engineer on the ISS in 2002 and 2003. Pettit was the backup to NASA astronaut Donald Thomas, who was pulled from the mission just weeks before its scheduled flight due to medical concerns and replaced by Pettit. 

During his six-month stay aboard the space station, he performed two EVAs to help install external scientific equipment. During free time on his stay aboard the International Space Station, he conducted demonstrations showing how fluids react in an extremely low gravity environment in a series he called &quot;Saturday Morning Science&quot;.

The Expedition 6 mission was extended by about two months, following the loss of the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; in February 2003 and the subsequent grounding of the shuttle fleet. Instead of returning on a shuttle, the crew returned in the Russian Soyuz TMA-1 capsule, the first time American astronauts had launched on the Space Shuttle and landed in a Soyuz.

Pettit&#x27;s first landing experience on Soyuz was harrowing. He had been concerned that the film documenting his science experiments would be damaged by space radiation before the next shuttle could bring it home, so to safeguard the film and other items, Pettit secured them in a pack he placed on his chest during reentry. While a normal Soyuz entry involves 3 G&#x27;s, making the pack manageable, due to a guidance system failure during the Soyuz TMA&#x27;s inaugural reentry, the capsule underwent a ballistic reentry, subjecting the crew to over 8 G&#x27;s. This extreme force made the pack feel like a weight pressing down on Pettit&#x27;s chest. Pettit was left exhausted and reportedly dislocated a shoulder, but the space agencies downplayed the situation saying the astronauts were in good shape.

==== STS-126 ====
Pettit was a mission specialist on the STS-126 mission to deliver equipment and supplies to the ISS.

Pettit also performed experiments on board ISS related to the clumping of solid particles in microgravity. The experiments showed that particles of various materials which varied in size between 1 micrometer and 6 mm naturally clumped together in microgravity when confined to a volume of 4 liters that included a few grams of the materials. The cause was theorized to be electrostatic. This presents a plausible mechanism for the initial stages of planetary formation, since particles of this size do not have sufficient gravity to cause this phenomenon.

==== Expedition 30/31 ====
Pettit again launched to the International Space Station on December 21, 2011, as part of the Expedition 30/31 crew. He and fellow crew members Oleg Kononenko and André Kuipers arrived at the ISS on December 23.
Among his off-duty video demonstrations on the space station has been on water as thin film and the Marangoni convection. On May 25, 2012, Pettit operated the Canadarm2 to grapple the first SpaceX Dragon 1 and berth it to the &quot;Harmony&quot; module. During the capture, he was quoted saying, &quot;Houston, Station, we&#x27;ve got us a dragon by the tail.&quot;

This marked the first time a private spacecraft had ever rendezvoused with the ISS. The Dragon capsule was carrying supplies for the ISS, and the successful capture demonstrated the feasibility of using privately developed spacecraft to resupply the station. Pettit was the first to enter the uncrewed supply ship on May 26, making him the first astronaut in the history of space exploration to successfully enter a commercially-built and operated spacecraft in orbit.

===== Angry Birds Space Demos =====

During Expedition 30, on behalf of NASA in cooperation with Finland-based Rovio Entertainment, creator of the Angry Birds franchise, Pettit also made another video by using an Angry Birds character to explain how physics works in space, including demonstrating trajectories in microgravity by catapulting a Red Bird through the space station.

NASA states that such collaboration may share the excitement of space with the game community, educate users on NASA&#x27;s programs, and create interactive educational experiences for the public.

The footage was released by NASA both on its official site and YouTube along with another commercial version by Rovio on March 8, 2012, to announce the launch of new game Angry Birds Space on March 22, 2012.

==== Expedition 71/72 ====
On September 11, 2024, Pettit flew to space on Soyuz MS-26 commanded by Aleksey Ovchinin and with Ivan Vagner. The trio joined the crew of Expedition 71 and 72 for an approximately six month mission to the ISS. There, Pettit conducted NASA experiments and continued his astrophotography to viral acclaim.

== Innovations and inventions ==

During Expedition 6, Pettit used spare parts found throughout the Station to construct a barn door tracker; the device compensates for the movement of the ISS relative to the Earth&#x27;s surface, permitting sharper high resolution images of city lights at night from the orbiting space station.

In November 2008, Pettit invented the zero-g coffee cup, which used the wetting angle to carry fluid along a crease to permit drinking and avoid the necessity of a straw. This zero-g cup was featured in the May 2009 issue of &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine, along with his notes on the relation of the internal cup angle to the contact wetting angle for various construction materials. The cup received the first ever patent for an object invented in space.

== Antarctica ==
From November 2006 through January 2007, Pettit joined the Antarctic Search for Meteorites (ANSMET), spending six weeks in the Antarctic summer collecting meteorite samples, including a lunar meteorite. During the expedition, he was called on to perform emergency electrical repairs to a snowmobile and emergency dental surgery. Periods of tent-confining inclement weather were spent continuing his Saturday Morning Science series—&quot;on Ice&quot;—with photographic surveys of crystal sizes of glacial ice samples and collections of magnetic micrometeorites from ice melt used for cooking water. He estimated Antarctic glacial ice to contain roughly 1 micrometeorite per liter.

<doc id="467726" wikidata="Q541787" url="?curid=467726" title="William King (governor)">
<text>William King (February 9, 1768June 17, 1852) was an American merchant, shipbuilder, army officer, and statesman from Bath, Maine. A proponent of statehood for Maine, he became its first governor when it separated from Massachusetts in 1820. He was the half-brother of Rufus King, who was a member of the Confederation Congress from Massachusetts, delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1787, served as United States Senator from New York (from 1789 to 1796 and again from 1813 to 1825), and as Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of St. James from 1796 to 1803 and again from 1825 to 1826.

==Personal and business career==

William King was born to Richard King, a merchant and shipowner, and Mary Black, on February 9, 1768, at Scarborough, then in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. His formal education was limited to local schools (he spent one term at Phillips Academy) and ended when he was thirteen. He was largely self-educated. Starting as a hand in a saw-mill, he went on to open his own mill.

King was employed in a variety of businesses, including as a shipbuilder, then a ship-owner. He became the largest merchant shipping owner in Maine. He became a successful merchant and a significant real-estate investor. He opened the first cotton mill in Maine, at Brunswick. He founded and was president of the first bank of Bath.

In 1812, what is now known as the Stone House, King&#x27;s summer retreat, was built in rural Bath.

King was a Scottish Rite Freemason and later – while he was the Governor of the State – he became the first (Past) Grand Master of Maine, elected in June 1820, by the representatives of twenty-four Lodges which &quot;met, adopted a Constitution, and elected officers&quot;.

==Political career==
King became active politically in 1795 as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party. He represented Topsham in the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1795 and 1799. After he moved to Bath, he represented that town in 1804. He served in the Massachusetts Senate for Lincoln County from 1807 to 1811.

When the War of 1812 began, Massachusetts made him major general of the militia, in charge of the District of Maine. He devoted much of his attention to coastal shipping and defenses. He also led recruiting efforts for the regular army, for which he was made a colonel in the United States Army. In 1813 King began a seven-year effort that started with his petition to Massachusetts for separation.

In 1816 he was re-elected to the Massachusetts Senate, and finally secured their approval for Maine to become a separate state, in 1818. The Missouri Compromise allowed Maine to be recognized as a state on March 15, 1820. He was shortly thereafter elected governor of the new state.

In May 1821, President James Monroe named him as one of three commissioners to settle land claims from the 1819 Adams–Onís Treaty known as the Spanish Claims Commission. King resigned as governor on May 28, 1821, to take the position of U.S. commissioner, serving until 1824.

In 1828 he was appointed by president Andrew Jackson to serve as Customs Collector of Bath.

With the shifting of political parties, he ran once more for governor, as a Whig in 1835, but lost.

==Later life==
King continued as a prominent business man, investor, and ship-owner. Even though he had a very limited education, he served for years as a trustee and overseer of Bowdoin College, and as a trustee of Waterville College (now called Colby College).

He died at home, in Bath, Maine, on June 17, 1852, and is buried in the city&#x27;s Maple Grove Cemetery.

==Legacy==
In 1878, the State of Maine placed the &quot;William King&quot; statue by sculptor Franklin Simmons in the National Statuary Hall of the U.S. Capitol Building. In 1902, a descendent placed a plaque on a boulder at the King Burial Ground in Scarborough to memorialize Richard King and his sons, including William. In 2024, the Scarborough Historical Society added an information sign to provide additional information about the family.

<text>The Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide (DMG or DM&#x27;s Guide; in some printings, the Dungeon Masters Guide or Dungeon Master Guide) is a book of rules for the fantasy role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. The &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; contains rules concerning the arbitration and administration of a game, and is intended for use by the game&#x27;s Dungeon Master.

The &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; is a companion book to the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, which contains all of the basic rules of gameplay, and the &quot;Monster Manual&quot;, which is a reference book of statistics for various animals and monsters. The &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot;, and &quot;Monster Manual&quot; are collectively referred to as the &quot;core rules&quot; of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game. Both the &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; and the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; give advice, tips, and suggestions for various styles of play.

While all players, including the Dungeon Master, are expected to have at their disposal a copy of the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, only the Dungeon Master is expected to refer to the &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; or &quot;Monster Manual&quot; during gameplay.

==&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;==
The original AD&amp;D &quot;Dungeon Masters Guide&quot; (sic) was published by TSR in 1979. It was written by Gary Gygax and published as a 232-page hardcover with a cover by David C. Sutherland III. The book was intended to provide Dungeon Masters all the information and rules necessary to run a campaign for the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game. The 1983 printing featured a new cover by Jeff Easley.

Like other volumes of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; handbooks, the &quot;Dungeon Masters Guide&quot; has gone through several versions through the years. The original edition was written by Gary Gygax and edited by Mike Carr, who also wrote the foreword. The original cover art was by David C. Sutherland III, and interior illustrations were provided by Sutherland, D. A. Trampier, Darlene Pekul, Will McLean, David S. LaForce, and Erol Otus.

The first edition &quot;Dungeon Masters Guide&quot; covered the essential game rules for the Dungeon Master: creating and managing both player characters and non-player characters, directing combat, and handling adventures and campaigns that last multiple sessions. The book also included game statistics for magic items and treasure, details how to use random monster encounters, and provides statistics for some of the basic monsters and creatures of the game. New magic items were introduced.

The &quot;Dungeon Masters Guide&quot; contains scores of tables and charts for figuring damage and resolving encounters in a typical adventure, tables and rules for creating characters, and lists of the various abilities of the different classes of characters.

One supplement to the &quot;Guide&quot; was the &quot;Dungeon Masters Screen&quot;: two heavy-duty tri-fold boards with the most frequently used tables printed on them for easy reference. The 1979 second edition of the screen describes its purpose as &quot;useful for shielding maps and other game materials from the players when placed upright, and also provide[s] instant reference to the charts and tables most commonly used during play.&quot; The &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; Second Edition screen came packaged with a brief adventure; later editions of that screen, and screens produced for later editions, have instead included character sheets and general reference booklets.

A feature of the first edition &quot;Dungeon Masters Guide&quot; was the random dungeon generator. The generator allowed the Dungeon Master, by the rolling of dice, to generate a dungeon adventure &quot;on the fly&quot;. A dungeon complete with passageways, rooms, treasure, monsters, and other encounters could easily and randomly be constructed as the player progressed. It could be used with several people or a single player. The generator was not included in subsequent editions of the &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; but made a re-appearance in the fifth edition &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot;.

In 1999, a paperback reprint of the first edition was released.

The first edition &quot;Dungeon Masters Guide&quot; was reproduced as a premium reprint on July 17, 2012.

===Reception===
The original &quot;Dungeon Masters Guide&quot; was reviewed by Don Turnbull in issue #16 of the magazine &quot;White Dwarf&quot; (December 1979/January 1980). Turnbull commented mostly on the size of the book, &quot;I would say that only the most severe critic could point at a minor omission, let alone a serious one.&quot;

Scott Taylor for &quot;Black Gate&quot; in 2014 listed both the 1st edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; &quot;DMG&quot; re-cover and the 2nd Edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; &quot;DMG&quot; both by Jeff Easley as #10 in The Top 10 TSR Cover Paintings of All Time.

Scott Taylor of &quot;Black Gate&quot; listed the &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; as #2 on the list of &quot;Top 10 &#x27;Orange Spine&#x27; &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; Hardcovers By Jeff Easley, saying &quot;Not taking anything away from EVERYTHING THAT THE DM IS and how well Jeff represents it here, but I still believe when many folks think about an &#x27;orange spine&#x27;, they are going to remember #1 first, because at the end of the day, this [is] a re-cover, and half the folks out there are going to be about the Sutherland III edition.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;The &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; is strange and deeply idiosyncratic. Without a doubt, I believe it&#x27;s also a masterpiece. Gygax expresses in it a singular vision that feels &quot;true&quot; in a way few other RPG books can ever hope to equal — it is an accidental portrait of the man&#x27;s brain circa 1978.&quot;

==&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 2nd edition==
The AD&amp;D 2nd Edition &quot;Dungeon Master Guide&quot; was released in 1989. This 192-page hardcover book was designed by David &quot;Zeb&quot; Cook, with cover art by Jeff Easley. The book featured interior illustrations by Easley, Clyde Caldwell, John and Laura Lakey, David Dorman, Douglas Chaffee, and Jean E. Martin.

This &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; featured revised second edition rules, reorganized and streamlined for the Dungeon Master. The book detailed options for character creation, handling the alignment rules, new rules for money and equipment, treasure and magical items, encounters, time and movement, and managing non-player characters. The book is indexed, and contains numerous full-page color illustrations.

The second edition &quot;Dungeon Master Guide&quot; is an ORIGINS and Gamer&#x27;s Choice award-winner. In his 1991 book &quot;Heroic Worlds&quot;, Lawrence Schick commented that this book contained &quot;lots of excellent new advice on how to run &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;&quot;. A new version of the &quot;Dungeon Master Guide&quot;, with new art and layout but the same text, was released in 1995, as part of TSR&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

The 2nd edition &quot;Dungeon Master Guide&quot; was reproduced as a premium reprint on May 21, 2013.

===Reception===
Stephan Wieck reviewed the 2nd Edition &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #17 (1989) and stated that &quot;There are no great changes to the DMG, except that it has become as much a guide of advice for Dungeon Masters as a manual of specific information.&quot;

==&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3rd edition==

The 3rd edition D&amp;D &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; was published in September 2000.

Monte Cook, Jonathan Tweet, and Skip Williams all contributed to the 3rd edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot;, and &quot;Monster Manual&quot;, and then each designer wrote one of the books based on those contributions. Cook is credited with the book&#x27;s design. Cover art is by Henry Higginbotham, with interior art by Lars Grant-West, Scott Fischer, John Foster, Todd Lockwood, David Martin, Arnie Swekel, Kevin Walker, Sam Wood, and Wayne Reynolds. &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; was republished in 2001 as a slightly revised edition, correcting a few errors in the first edition.

In 2003, the &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; was revised for the 3.5 edition. David Noonan and Rich Redman are credited for the &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; 3.5 revision. Cover art is by Henry Higginbotham, with interior art by Matt Cavotta, Ed Cox, Lars Grant-West, Scott Fischer, John Foster, Jeremy Jarvis, John and Laura Lakey, Todd Lockwood, David Martin, Raven Mimura, Wayne Reynolds, Scott Roller, Brian Snoddy, Arnie Swekel, and Sam Wood.

When asked about the changes from the previous &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot;, Rich Redman said:

The D&amp;D &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; (v3.5) was reproduced as a premium reprint on September 18, 2012.

==&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th edition==
The 4th edition D&amp;D &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; was released on June 6, 2008, at the same time as its companion volumes. It is a 224-page hardcover written by James Wyatt. The front cover illustration was by Wayne Reynolds and the back cover illustration is by Brian Hagan, with interior illustrations by Rob Alexander, Steve Argyle, Wayne England, Jason Engle, David Griffith, Espen Grundetjern, Brian Hagan, Ralph Horsley, Howard Lyon, Lee Moyer, William O&#x27;Connor, Wayne Reynolds, Dan Scott, Ron Spears, Chris Stevens, Anne Stokes, and Eva Widermann. In addition to a comprehensive look at how to DM a 4th Edition campaign or adventure, it contains information on building encounters, aquatic and mounted combat, skill challenges, traps and hazards, rewards, NPC creation, artifacts, monster creation, and template, along with a sample town and short adventure so that DMs can start running their first 4th Edition adventure right away. Although it does contain artifacts, it is the first &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; not to contain standard magic items, which were moved into the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; for 4th Edition.

Shannon Appelcline, author of &quot;Designers &amp; Dragons&quot;, highlighted that the book introduced mechanical changes such as a &quot;new style for adventure encounters&quot; and a &quot;skill challenge system&quot; which were part of the key design philosophies of 4th edition. Appelcline wrote &quot;besides revamping philosophies &quot;and&quot; rules, D&amp;D 4e also revamped the game&#x27;s standard world model and its cosmology&quot; and &quot;Wizards also introduced a new world setting that has become most popularly known as &#x27;Nentir Vale&#x27; (though that just designates a small part of the world)&quot;.

In September 2009, the &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide 2&quot; was released. It was written by James Wyatt, with Bill Slavicsek, Mike Mearls, and Robin D. Laws. Appelcline wrote &quot;the original Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide had covered heroic adventuring (levels 1-10), so now the Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide 2 detailed paragon adventuring (levels 11-20). However, there is much more in the book too, including storytelling advice, skill challenge and monster customization, and the return of one of D&amp;D&#x27;s most beloved settings&quot;. The &quot;fan-favorite setting of Sigil&quot; was last revisited in depth in the &quot;Planescape Campaign Setting&quot; (1994) for the 2nd edition.

As part of the &quot;Essentials&quot; line of products, which were intended as an easy entry point for new players, Wizards of the Coast released a &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Kit&quot; (2010) that included a digest-sized book for the Dungeon Master containing much of the same material as the 4th edition &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; along with a two-part adventure module and a set of cardboard tokens for monsters.

==&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 5th edition==
The 5th edition &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; was released in 2014 as the last of three core rulebooks for the new edition. On the staggered release schedule, Jeremy Crawford wrote &quot;our small team couldn’t finish the books at the same time and also ensure their high quality. [...] We could either stagger their releases, or we could sit on the books until all three were finished&quot;. Crawford and Mike Mearls co-lead design for the Fifth Edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. &quot;Polygon&quot; reported that the book &quot;is by far the densest of the rulebooks yet released, but shares the same cover price — $50 in the US&quot;.

In an interview with &quot;Escapist Magazine&quot;, Mearls said:&quot;Basic D&amp;D&quot; hits core fantasy, it&#x27;s stereotypical fantasy adventuring. If you&#x27;re the DM and you want to do something more exotic, you say &quot;I want to add technology to my game&quot; or &quot;I want to have more detailed rules for a grim and grittier game, more of a horror game.&quot; That&#x27;s where the &quot;DMG&quot; comes in, it&#x27;s for really fine-tuning your campaign, and creating a different type of experience than your standard fantasy campaign. It&#x27;s also for expanding the scope of the game. [...] The &quot;DMG&quot; also has a lot of utilities in it, like for dungeon creation, adventure creation, creating monsters, creating spells, even if you wanted to create a character class. [...] So it&#x27;s really for getting under the hood of how the system works and building up your campaign.

=== Reception ===
The book won the 2015 ENnie &quot;Best Supplement&quot; Gold award and the 2015 Origins &quot;Best Role-Playing Game Supplement&quot; and &quot;Fan Favorite&quot; awards.

Henry Glasheen, for &quot;SLUG Magazine&quot;, wrote &quot;Fifth Edition, to my eyes, is the new gold standard for D20-based tabletop RPGs. It strips away the tedium of systems and statistics and replaces them with the true substance of role playing—deep, immersive stories. I’ve often found that the Dungeon Master’s Guide was the most vestigial of all the D&amp;D manuals, but Fifth Edition has elevated this previously tertiary book into something far more important and useful&quot;.

Jonathan Bolding, for &quot;Escapist Magazine&quot;, wrote &quot;however, on finishing the book it&#x27;s clear that while many critics - myself included - thought that this system would hinge on the &quot;DMG&quot;, the DMG just confirmed what we already knew &quot;D&amp;D&quot; 5th Edition to be. This is a living history of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, a collection of what the game has been so far. Perfection, not innovation. Options, not prescriptions&quot;.

Chuck Francisco of mania.com commented: &quot;Miles of treasure tables escort a wealth of random adventure tables to the ball, where they&#x27;re resplendent in all of their easy session crafting majesty. The versatility of this tome is nowhere more obvious than amongst the flavor filled side panels, which further detail the lower magical level of the main setting, before explaining all of the variable options a DM has in bringing to life a world of their own.&quot;

In a review of &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, Scott Taylor said &quot;The 5E &quot;DMG&quot; devotes the first 127 pages to teaching a novice player how to [be] a Dungeon Master in this system. Where Gygax made the assumption that an aspiring DM needed to sit at a table as a player and learn the system from another, become inspired, and then extrapolate on what they&#x27;d learned firsthand, the folks [at] Wizards of the Coast have gone in the opposite direction and believe anyone buying this book has never really played &quot;D&amp;D&quot; before and needs instruction on how to DM the game.&quot;

<doc id="467731" wikidata="Q15148" url="?curid=467731" title="Spatula">
<text>A spatula is a broad, flat, flexible blade used to mix, spread and lift material including foods, drugs, plaster and paints.

In medical applications, &quot;spatula&quot; may also be used synonymously with tongue depressor.

The word &quot;spatula&quot; derives from the Latin word for a flat piece of wood or splint, a diminutive form of the Latin , meaning &#x27;broadsword&#x27;, and hence can also refer to a tongue depressor. The words &quot;spade&quot; (digging tool) and &quot;spathe&quot; are similarly derived. The word &quot;spatula&quot; has been used in English since 1525.

==Use==
Spatulas are usually used to scrape within the contours of a mixing bowl or to level off the top of a dry mixing cup.

==Kitchen use==

===American English===
In American English, &quot;spatula&quot; refers broadly to a number of broad, flat utensils. The word commonly refers to a turner or flipper (known in British English as a &quot;fish slice&quot;), used to lift and flip food items during cooking, such as pancakes and fillets. The blades on these are usually made of metal or plastic, with a wooden or plastic handle to insulate them from heat. A &quot;cookie shovel&quot; is a turner with a larger blade, made for lifting cookies off a pan or baking sheet.

A frosting spatula is also known as palette knife and is usually made of metal or plastic.

Bowl and plate scrapers are sometimes called spatulas.

===British English===
In British English a spatula is similar in shape to a palette knife, without holes, in a flexible or detachable blade. It is used in medical examinations, for holding down the tongue or taking cell samples. The term is also commonly used in cookery to refer to a scraper, as in American English.

=== Non-regional===
In addition to the regional senses, a spatula can be used in both British and American English to refer to a tool with a flat, blunt blade used for mixing and spreading things as opposed to one used for lifting and flipping food, an example of which is the rubber scraper shown on the right.

== Laboratory use ==
In laboratories, &quot;spatulas&quot; and &quot;microspatulas&quot; are small stainless steel utensils, used for scraping, transferring, or applying powders and paste-like chemicals or treatments. Many spatula brands are also resistant to acids, bases, heat, and solvents, which make them ideal for use with a wide range of compounds. A common type would be stainless steel spatulas, which are widely used because they are sturdy and affordable. They are resistant to deterioration from contact with boiling water, acids, bases, and most solvents. Some of them come with a polyvinyl chloride plastic handle or riveted hardwood for better handling. Polystyrene spatulas are made for researchers because they are disposable, preventing any potential contaminations which occurs often with reusable spatulas. They are also ideal for handling lyophilized products or performing lyophilization.

<doc id="467734" wikidata="Q962057" url="?curid=467734" title="Félix d'Hérelle">
<text>Félix d&#x27;Hérelle (25 April 1873 – 22 February 1949) was a French microbiologist. He was co-discoverer of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) and experimented with the possibility of phage therapy. D&#x27;Hérelle has also been credited for his contributions to the larger concept of applied microbiology.

d&#x27;Hérelle was a self-taught microbiologist. In 1917 he discovered that &quot;an invisible antagonist&quot;, when added to bacteria on agar, would produce areas of dead bacteria. The antagonist, now known to be a bacteriophage, could pass through a Chamberland filter. He accurately diluted a suspension of these viruses and discovered that the highest dilutions (lowest virus concentrations), rather than killing all the bacteria, formed discrete areas of dead organisms. Counting these areas and multiplying by the dilution factor allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the original suspension. He realised that he had discovered a new form of virus and later coined the term &quot;bacteriophage&quot;.
Between 1918 and 1921 d&#x27;Herelle discovered different types of bacteriophages that could infect several other species of bacteria including &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;. Bacteriophages were heralded as a potential treatment for diseases such as typhoid and cholera, but their promise was forgotten with the development of penicillin. Since the early 1970s, bacteria have continued to develop resistance to antibiotics such as penicillin, and this has led to a renewed interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat serious infections.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Félix d&#x27;Hérelle&#x27;s place of birth has been debated, but current research has concluded that he was born in France. Félix d&#x27;Hérelle&#x27;s father, Hubert Augustin Félix Haerens d&#x27;Herelle, died at the age of 30 when Félix was six years old. From 7 to 17 years of age, d&#x27;Hérelle attended school in Paris, including the Lycée Condorcet and Lycée Louis-le-Grand high schools. In the fall of 1891, d&#x27;Hérelle traveled to Bonn, Germany where he attended lectures at the University of Bonn for several months. Between the ages of 16 and 24, d&#x27;Hérelle traveled extensively via money given by his mother. At 16, he started to travel through western Europe by bike. At 17, after finishing school, he traveled through South America. Afterwards, he continued his travels through Europe, including Turkey, where he, at 20, met his wife, Marie Caire.

At 24, now the father of a daughter, d&#x27;Hérelle and his family moved to Canada. He built a home laboratory and studied microbiology from books and his own experiments. Through the influence of a friend of his late father, he earned a commission from the Canadian government to study the fermentation and distillation of maple syrup to schnapps. His father&#x27;s friend pointed out that Pasteur &quot;made a good beginning by studying fermentations, so it might be interesting to you, too.&quot; He also worked as a medic for a geological expedition, even though he had no medical degree or real experience. Together with his brother, he invested almost all his money in a chocolate factory, which soon went bankrupt. During this period, d&#x27;Herelle published his first scientific paper, &quot;De la formation du carbone par les végétaux&quot; in the May 1901 issue of &quot;Le Naturaliste Canadien&quot;. d&#x27;Hérelle contended in the paper that the results of his experiments indicated that carbon was a compound, not an element.

===Guatemala and Mexico===
With his money almost gone and his second daughter born, he took a contract with the government of Guatemala as a bacteriologist at the General Hospital in Guatemala City. Some of his work included organizing defenses against the dread diseases of the time: malaria and yellow fever. He also studied a local fungal infection of coffee plants, and discovered that acidifying the soil could serve as an effective treatment. As a side job, he was asked to find a way to make whiskey from bananas. Life in the rough and dangerous environment of the country was hard on his family, but d&#x27;Hérelle, always adventurer at heart, rather enjoyed working close to &quot;real life&quot;, compared to the sterile environments of a &quot;civilized&quot; clinic. He later stated that his scientific path began on this occasion.

In 1907, he took an offer from the Mexican government to continue his studies on fermentation. He and his family moved to a sisal plantation near Mérida, Yucatán. Disease struck at him and his family, but in 1909, he had successfully established a method to produce sisal schnapps.

===Return to France ===
Machines for mass production of sisal schnapps were ordered in Paris, where he oversaw the machines&#x27; construction. Meanwhile, in his spare time, he worked for free in a laboratory at the Pasteur Institute. He was soon offered the job of running the new Mexican plant, but declined, considering it &quot;too boring&quot;. He did, however, take the time to attempt stopping a locust plague at the plantation using their own diseases. He extracted bacteria pathogenic to locusts from their guts. This innovative approach to locust plagues anticipated modern biological pest control using Bacillus thuringiensis also known as Bt.

D&#x27;Hérelle and his family finally moved to Paris in early 1911, where he worked again as an unpaid assistant in a lab at the Pasteur Institute. He got attention in the scientific community the same year, when the results of his successful attempt to counter the Mexican locust plague with &quot;Coccobacillus&quot; were published.

===Argentina===
At the end of the year, restless d&#x27;Hérelle was again on the road, this time in Argentina, where he was offered a chance to test these results on a much larger scale. Thus, in 1912 and 1913, he fought the Argentinian locust plagues with coccobacillus experiments. Even though Argentina claimed his success was inconsistent, he himself declared it a full success, and was subsequently invited to other countries to demonstrate the method.

===France and phages===
During World War I, d&#x27;Hérelle and assistants (his wife and daughters among them) produced over 12 million doses of medication for the allied military. At this point in history, medical treatments were primitive, compared to today&#x27;s standards. The smallpox vaccine, developed by Edward Jenner, was one of the few vaccines available. The primary antibiotic was the arsenic-based &quot;salvarsan&quot; against syphilis, with severe side effects. Common treatments were based mercury, strychnine, and cocaine. As a result, in 1900, the average life span was 45 years, and World War I did not change that to the better.

In 1915, British bacteriologist Frederick W. Twort discovered a small agent that infects and kills bacteria, but did not pursue the issue further. Independently, the discovery of &quot;an invisible, antagonistic microbe of the dysentery bacillus&quot; by d&#x27;Hérelle was announced on 3 September 1917. The isolation of phages by d&#x27;Herelle works like this:
#Nutritional medium is infected with bacteria; the medium turns opaque.
#The bacteria are infected with phages and die, producing new phages; the medium clears.
#The medium is filtered through porcelain filter, holding back bacteria and larger objects; only the smaller phages pass through.

In early 1919, d&#x27;Hérelle isolated phages from chicken feces, successfully treating a plague of chicken typhoid with them. After this successful experiment on chicken, he felt ready for the first trial on humans. The first patient was healed of dysentery using phage therapy in August 1919. Many more followed.

At the time, none, not even d&#x27;Hérelle, knew exactly what a phage was. D&#x27;Hérelle claimed that it was a biological organism that reproduces, somehow feeding off bacteria. Others, the Nobelist Jules Bordet chief among them, theorized that phages were inanimate chemicals, enzymes specifically, that were already present in bacteria, and only trigger the release of similar proteins, killing the bacteria in the process. Due to this uncertainty, and d&#x27;Hérelle using phages without much hesitation on humans, his work was under constant attack from many other scientists. It was not until the first phage was observed under an electron microscope by Helmut Ruska in 1939 that its true nature was established.

In 1920, d&#x27;Hérelle travelled to Indochina, pursuing studies of cholera and the plague, from where he returned at the end of the year. D&#x27;Hérelle, officially still an unpaid assistant, found himself without a lab; d&#x27;Hérelle later claimed this was a result of a quarrel with the assistant director of the Pasteur Institute, Albert Calmette. The biologist Edouard Pozerski had mercy on d&#x27;Hérelle and lent him a stool (literally) in his laboratory. In 1921, he managed to publish a monograph, &quot;The Bacteriophage: Its Role in Immunity&quot; about his works as an official Institute publication, by tricking Calmette. During the following year, doctors and scientists across western Europe took a heightened interest in phage therapy, successfully testing it against a variety of diseases. Since bacteria become resistant against a single phage, d&#x27;Herelle suggested using &quot;phage cocktails&quot; containing different phage strains.

Phage therapy soon became a boom, and a great hope in medicine. In 1924, 25 January, d&#x27;Hérelle received the honorary doctorate of the University of Leiden, as well as the Leeuwenhoek medal, which is only awarded once every ten years. The latter was especially important to him, as his idol Louis Pasteur received the same medal in 1895). The next year, he was nominated eight times for the Nobel Prize, though he was never awarded one.

===Egypt===
After holding a temporary position at the University of Leiden, d&#x27;Hérelle got a position with the &quot;Conseil Sanitaire, Maritime et Quarantenaire d&#x27;Egypte&quot; in Alexandria. The &quot;Conseil&quot; was put in place to prevent plague and cholera spreading to Europe, with special emphasis on the sanitary concerns about muslim pilgrim groups returning from Mecca and Medina.

===India===
D&#x27;Hérelle then used phages he collected from plague-infected rats during his 1920 visit to Indochina on human plague patients, with claimed success. The British Empire initiated a vast campaign against plague based on his results.

In 1926, the British government in India requested anti-plague phages for trials at the Haffkine Institute. The Institute had trouble maintaining the phages. D&#x27;Hérelle took unpaid leave from the Quarantine board of Egypt and went to Bombay at his own expense.

The Haffkine Institute had not used Martin&#x27;s medium, which included macerated pig stomach and beef muscle that would offend Muslims and Hindus. The institute&#x27;s medium used a hydrochloric acid digest of goat tissue. D&#x27;Herelle solved the problem by digestion with papaya juice (a source of papain).

Thereafter Lt Col J. Morison, acting director of the Haffkine Institute, became convinced of the effectiveness of phages. Morison wrote to the Government of India to invite d&#x27;Hérelle noting that he was &quot;a consummate technician, and a &quot;most inspiring worker.&quot;

D&#x27;Hérelle returned to India to work on cholera. He collaborated with the assistant director of the Haffkine Institute, Major Reginald Malone and M.N. Lahiri, who conducted experiments at the Campbell Hospital in Calcutta. The Campbell Hospital team also worked with Russian bacteriologist Igor Nicholas Asheshov (1891–1961), who was working in Patna. Experiments were conducted both in hospitals and in the field.

D&#x27;Hérelle and co-workers added phages to wells near camps crowded with many pilgrims. Cases of cholera in the camps were subsequently much lower. The phages were distributed to village head men in Assam and Bengal along with instructions.

However, this was a period when Gandhi&#x27;s Satyagraha was leading to non-cooperation by Indians. Many of the head men did not collaborate and fewer still reported back on the effectiveness. As a result, the experiment was disbanded in 1937.

===United States and commercial failures===
D&#x27;Hérelle refused a request the following year by the British government to work in India, as he had been offered a professorship at Yale University, which he accepted. Meanwhile, European and US pharmaceutical companies had taken up the production of their own phage medicine, and were promising impossible benefits.

To counteract this trend, d&#x27;Herelle agreed to co-found a French phage-producing company, piping the money back into phage research. All of the companies suffered from production problems, as results from commercial phage medicine were erratic.

Production problems were most likely due to the attempt to mass-produce phages when they were barely understood. The phages may have been damaged and/or too low in concentration. Another possibility is that incorrect diagnoses led to the use of the irrelevant types of phages that were not adapted to the host bacteria of interest. Many studies on the proposed healing effects of phages were also poorly designed and conducted.

This situation led to many influential members of the scientific community turning against d&#x27;Hérelle. The problems may have been compounded by d&#x27;Hérelle&#x27;s reputed bad temper, which was said to have made enemies of several other scientists.

===Soviet Union===
In about 1934, d&#x27;Hérelle went to Tbilisi, Georgia. He was welcomed to the Soviet Union as a hero, bringing knowledge of salvation from diseases ravaging the eastern states. He was even awarded with an honorary doctorate from Tbilisi State University in 1934.

D&#x27;Hérelle may have accepted Stalin&#x27;s invitation for two reasons. Firstly, he was said to be enamored with communism.
Secondly, d&#x27;Hérelle was happy to be working with his friend, Professor George Eliava, founder of the Tbilisi Institute, in 1923. Eliava had become friendly with d&#x27;Herelle during a visit to the Pasteur Institute in Paris in 1926, and had used that occasion to learn about phages.

D&#x27;Hérelle worked at the Tbilisi Institute off and on for about a year. He even dedicated one of his books to Comrade Stalin: &quot;The Bacteriophage and the Phenomenon of Recovery,&quot; written and published in Tbilisi in 1935. Indeed, d&#x27;Hérelle may have planned to take up permanent residence in Tbilisi, as he had started to build a cottage on the grounds of the institute. The same building would later house the Georgian headquarters of the NKVD.

Fortunes turned abruptly for d&#x27;Hérelle when Eliava fell in love with the same woman as Lavrenty Beria, head of the secret police. Eliava was executed and denounced as an enemy of the people during one of Stalin&#x27;s purges. As a result, d&#x27;Hérelle fled Tbilisi, never to return. His book was banned from distribution.

The Georgian period in d&#x27;Hérelle&#x27;s career has been investigated by author and medical scientist David Shrayer-Petrov.

===Final return to France===
Phage therapy boomed, despite all problems, driven by the military on both sides in an effort to keep the troops safe, at least from infections. D&#x27;Hérelle could not really enjoy this development; he was kept under house arrest by the German &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; in Vichy, France. He used the time to write his book &quot;The Value of Experiment&quot;, as well as his memoirs, the latter being 800 pages in length.

After D-Day, the new antibiotic drug penicillin became public knowledge and found its way into the hospitals in the west. As it was more reliable and easier to use than phage therapy, it soon became the method of choice, despite side effects and problems with resistant bacteria. Phage therapy remained a common treatment in the states of the Soviet Union, though, until its deconstruction.

Félix d&#x27;Hérelle was stricken with pancreatic cancer and died a forgotten man in Paris in 1949. He was buried in Saint-Mards-en-Othe in the department of the Aube in France.

In the 1960s Félix d&#x27;Hérelle&#x27;s name appeared on a list published by the Nobel Foundation of scientists who had been worthy of receiving the Nobel Prize but did not, for one reason or another. D&#x27;Herelle was nominated for the prize ten times.

However, France has not completely forgotten Félix d&#x27;Hérelle. There is an avenue that bears his name in the 16th arrondissement in Paris.

==Legacy==
D&#x27;Hérelle became widely known for his imaginative approaches to important problems in theoretical, as well as applied, microbiology. At the same time, he was widely reviled for his self-advertisement, his exaggerated claims of success and his sharp financial practices. He also had a talent for making enemies among powerful senior scientists.

D&#x27;Hérelle&#x27;s main legacy lies in the use of phage in the molecular revolution in biology. Max Delbrück and the &quot;phage group&quot; used bacteriophages to make the discoveries that led to the origins of molecular biology. Much of the initial work on the nature of genetic expression and its regulation was performed with bacteriophages by Francois Jacob, Andre Lwoff and Jacques Monod. In fact, immediately before his studies of the structure of DNA, James Watson had earned his Ph.D. by working on a bacteriophage-related project in Salvador Luria&#x27;s laboratory. A more detailed account of the use of phage in major biological discoveries can be found on the page, bacteriophage.

As one of the earliest applied microbiologists, d&#x27;Hérelle&#x27;s microbe-centered worldview has been noted for its prescience, since microbes are playing increasingly important roles in bioremediation, microbial fuel cells, gene therapy, and other areas with relevance to human well-being.

==Namesakes==
The family &quot;Herelleviridae&quot;, a group of bacteriophages in order &quot;Caudovirales&quot;, was named in honor of Félix d&#x27;Hérelle.

==Literary note==
The novel &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; written by Sinclair Lewis with scientific help from Paul de Kruif was based to a certain extent on the life of d&#x27;Hérelle. The novel &quot;The French Cottage&quot; (Russ. &quot;Frantsuzskii kottedz&quot;h) by David Shrayer-Petrov deals at length with d&#x27;Hérelle&#x27;s experience in Soviet Georgia.

<text>The Saudi riyal ( &quot;&quot;) is the currency of Saudi Arabia. It is abbreviated as
SAR, or SR &quot;(Saudi Arabian Riyal/Saudi Riyal)&quot;. It is subdivided into 100 halalas ( &quot;&quot;). The currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar at a constant rate of exchange.

==History==

The riyal has been the currency of Saudi Arabia since the country came into being and was the currency of Hejaz before Saudi Arabia was created, one of the primary currencies in the Mediterranean region during the Ottoman era. The Hejaz riyal was based on but not equivalent to the Ottoman 20 kuruş coin and was consequently divided into 20 qirsh. However, although the Hejaz riyal was the same weight as the Ottoman 20 kuruş, it was minted in .917 fineness, compared to .830 fineness for the Ottoman coin. Thus, because the first Saudi riyal had the same specifications as the Hejaz riyal and circulated alongside Ottoman coins, it came to be worth 22 Ottoman kuruş and was consequently subdivided into 22 ghirsh when coins denominated in qirsh were issued from 1925. The system remained even though the riyal was subsequently debased to a coin equivalent, in silver content, to the Indian rupee in 1935.

In 1960, the system was changed to 20 qirsh to a riyal, which was followed in 1963 by the introduction of the &quot;halala&quot;, one hundredth of a riyal. Some Saudi coins still bear denominations in qirsh, but it is no longer commonly used.

=== Currency symbol ===

On February 20, 2025, the Saudi Central Bank announced the approval of the Saudi riyal symbol by the King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. The symbol was designed by a committee composed of relevant official entities, including the Saudi Central Bank, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Media, and the Saudi Standards, Metrology and Quality Organization. 

Regarding the symbol, The Saudi Central Bank clarified that the design of the Saudi riyal symbol was inspired by Arabic calligraphy and consists solely of the Arabic letters of the word &quot;Riyal,&quot; without any additional elements. Additionally, the Saudi Central Bank has published the precise standards and proportions for designing the riyal symbol and guidelines for its usage.

===Historical exchange rates===
==Coins==
In 1925, transitional copper coins for and qirsh (in some parts of the country, it is pronounced girsh) were minted in Mecca by Ibn Saud. They were followed, in 1926, by , and 1 qirsh cupro-nickel pieces carrying the title &quot;King of Hejaz and Sultan of Nejd&quot;.

In 1927, the royal title was changed to &quot;King of Hejaz and Nejd and Dependencies&quot; and coins were issued in denominations of , and 1 qirsh in cupro-nickel and , and 1 riyal in silver.

In 1935, the first coins were issued in the name of Saudi Arabia. These were silver , and 1 riyal coins which were nearly 50% lighter than the previous issue. Cupro-nickel , and 1 qirsh were also issued from 1937. In 1946 (AH 1365), many of the cupro-nickel coins were countermarked with the Arabic numerals 65 in what Krause and Mishler describe as &quot;a move to break money changers&#x27; monopoly on small coins&quot;. Cupro-nickel 2 and 4 qirsh were introduced in 1957.

In 1963, the halala was introduced, and bronze 1 halala coins were issued. That was the only year they were struck. Cupro-nickel 5, 10, 25 and 50 halala followed in 1972, inscribed with their denomination in ghirsh or riyal (1, 2 qirsh, , riyal). In 1976, cupro-nickel 1 riyal coins were introduced, which are also inscribed with the denomination 100 halala. Bimetallic 1 riyal coins, also marked 100 halala, were issued in 1999.

A new series of 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 halalas and bimetallic 1 and 2 riyal coins was issued in 2016.

== Banknotes ==
In 1953, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) began issuing Hajj Pilgrim Receipts for 10 riyals, with 1 and 5 riyals following in 1954 and 1956, respectively. These resembled banknotes and were initially intended for use by pilgrims who exchanged foreign currency for them. However, they became widely accepted in Saudi Arabia and largely replaced silver riyal coins in major financial transactions. Consequently, the Monetary Agency began issuing regular banknotes for 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 riyals on 15 June 1961. The Pilgrim Receipts were withdrawn on 1 February 1965.

500 Riyal notes were introduced in 1983. 20 and 200 riyal banknotes were issued in 2000 to commemorate the centenary of the founding of what became the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The 5th series of banknotes bearing the face of King Abdullah were issued in 2007. The 6th series of banknotes bearing the face of King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud were issued on 14/3/1438H (13/12/2016).

===Series 5===

On May 20, 2007, &quot;the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, pursuant to article (4) of the Saudi Currency Law, issued under the Royal Decree No. (6) and dated 1/7/1379H.&quot; announced the fifth domination of the Saudi riyal that features King Abdullah&#x27;s picture on all notes except the 500 riyals, which features King Abdulaziz. The 100 and 50 riyal notes were released on May 21, 2007. The 10 and 5 riyal notes followed in June 2007, then the 500 riyal followed in September 2007, and finally the 1 riyal note completed the series in December 2007. It is expected by the SAMA that the fourth (current) series will take approximately two years to phase out, although a complete removal of the current series require more than two years since the fourth series has been in circulation for well over 25 years. The fourth series which feature King Fahd&#x27;s picture will remain legal tender under the Saudi Arabian monetary law. The new series have the latest and most advanced security system to prevent from counterfeiting and other similar activities.
===Series 6 (2016 series)===
The newly renamed Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority unveiled a new family of banknotes with the portrait of King Salman on banknotes from 5 to 100 riyals, with a portrait of King Abdulaziz Al Saud on the 500 riyals banknote. On the 4 October 2020, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority announced the first polymer note to be used in Saudi Arabia, being the 5 riyals note, to replace the current paper banknote, without any announcement on the other banknotes. The banknote was said to feature more environmentally friendly materials and additional security features, in addition to a much longer lifespan.

The commemorative 20 riyal note, released in 2020 to commemorate the G20, attracted attention on release, as its reverse depicts the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir as a separate nation from India. While this design feature was met with criticism in most of India, it was received favourably by people in Kashmir and on social media, as it was viewed as a tacit form of approval of the region&#x27;s separatism movement.


==Fixed exchange rate==
In June 1986, the riyal was officially pegged to the IMF&#x27;s special drawing rights (SDRs). In practice, it is fixed at 1 U.S. dollar = 3.75 riyals, which translates to approximately 1 riyal = 0.266667 dollar. This rate was made official on January 1, 2003.

The riyal briefly rose to a 20-year high after the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates on September 18, 2007, and the SAMA chose not to follow suit, partially due to concerns about the inflationary effects low interest rates and a lower value for the riyal. The riyal returned to its peg against the U.S. dollar in early December 2007.

==Proposed monetary union==

Saudi Arabia is a member of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, which planned a monetary union with a single currency by 2010. However, all GCC countries operate with their own currency so far.

<text>High court is a name for a variety of courts, often with jurisdiction over the most serious issues. 

For countries with a civil law system, the term &#x27;high court&#x27; usually refers to appellate court dealing with first stage of appeal from a trial court, serving as an intermediate body before appeal to the constitutional court, court of cassation, supreme court, or other highest judicial body. 

The Tokyo High Court of Japan is an example of such a body, hearing appeals from district courts (the general trial courts)

In common law countries, mainly those in the former British Empire, the high court is often the superior trial court, and has plenary original jurisdiction, with lower courts (such as district courts or magistrates&#x27; courts) having limited jurisdiction; often, the high court tries the most serious offences such as murder, rape, and terrorism. 

Additionally, a high court may serve as an intermediate appellate body before appeal to a supreme or constitutional court. Some jurisdictions, especially federations, may have multiple high courts each with jurisdiction over a particular region. One notable exception is the High Court of Australia, which has both original and appellate jurisdiction in addition to performing constitutional court-like functions. The tasks of a typical Commonwealth high court are handled by the state supreme courts and the Federal Court.

<text>Jürgen Flimm (; 17 July 1941 – 4 February 2023) was a German theatre and opera director, theatre manager, and academic teacher. Flimm was first active in drama, and made the Thalia Theater in Hamburg one of the most successful German theatres when he managed it from 1985 to 2000. He was general manager of the Salzburg Festival and RuhrTriennale festivals, and intendant of the Berlin State Opera from 2010 to 2018. He directed internationally, including Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera, the 2000 &quot;Ring&quot; cycle production at the Bayreuth Festival, and the 2002 world premiere of Friedrich Cerha&#x27;s &quot;Der Riese vom Steinfeld&quot; at the Vienna State Opera.

== Life and career ==
Flimm was born in Gießen on 17 July 1941, but grew up in Cologne in a Protestant physician&#x27;s family. He studied theory of drama, literature, and sociology at the University of Cologne, and gained theatre experience at the Theater der Keller, a small stage in a basement with an associated acting school. His first position was assistant director at the Munich Kammerspiele in 1968. He was stage director at the Nationaltheater Mannheim, director at the Thalia Theater in Hamburg from 1973 to 1974, and worked at the Schauspiel Köln from 1979. A first success there was Kleist&#x27;s &quot;Das Käthchen von Heilbronn&quot;, with Katharina Thalbach in the title role.

In 1985, Flimm moved again to the Thalia Theater, where he was general manager for 15 years. Among his most important productions there were works by Anton Chekhov, &quot;Platonov&quot; in 1989, &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; in 1995, and &quot;Three Sisters&quot; in 1999, Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; in 1985 and &quot;The Wild Duck&quot; in 1994, Schnitzler&#x27;s &quot;Liebelei&quot; in 1988 and &quot;&quot; in 1995, and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; in 1986, &quot;King Lear&quot; in 1992, and &quot;As You Like It&quot; in 1998. The theatre was well-attended and became an intellectual centre during this period.

In 1978, he directed his first opera, Luigi Nono&#x27;s &quot;Al gran sole carico d&#x27;amore&quot; at the Oper Frankfurt. He staged Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Les contes d&#x27;Hoffmann&quot; at the Staatsoper Hamburg in 1981, and Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; in Amsterdam, where he first collaborated with conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt. Flimm directed operas at La Scala in Milan, the Royal Opera House in London, and the Vienna State Opera. He directed Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. In summer 2000, he directed a new production of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; for the Bayreuth Festival, in sets by Erich Wonder and conducted by Giuseppe Sinopoli. His first production at the Berlin State Opera was Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; in 2001, conducted by Daniel Barenboim. In June 2002, he directed the world premiere of &quot;Der Riese vom Steinfeld&quot; by Friedrich Cerha at the Vienna State Opera, conducted by Michael Boder.

Flimm was a professor at the University of Hamburg, and also taught at Harvard University and the New York University. He was a member of the Academies of Arts in Hamburg, Munich, Berlin, and Frankfurt. He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Hildesheim. He was awarded the Medal for Art and Science of Hamburg, the Konrad Wolf Prize of the Academy of Arts in Berlin, the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, and the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art.

Between 1999 and 2003, Flimm was the president of the Deutscher Bühnenverein (German Stage Association). He managed the drama section of the Salzburg Festival from 2001 to 2005, and from 2005 until 2007 he was general manager of the RuhrTriennale, following founding director Gerard Mortier. He was artistic director of the Salzburg Festival from 2006 to 2010, staging operas such as Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; and Purcell&#x27;s &quot;King Arthur&quot;. He initiated a Young Directors Project at the festival that made promising new directors internationally known, such as Alvis Hermanis. He engaged to direct Hofmannsthal&#x27;s &quot;Jedermann&quot;, modernising the traditional festival feature.

In 2010, Flimm became intendant of the Berlin State Opera. He managed the house during the long period of restoration, along with Daniel Barenboim as Generalmusikdirektor. After the reopening in 2017, he retired in 2018.

Flimm died in Hamelwörden, north of Hamburg, on 4 February 2023 at age 81.

<text>169 (one hundred [and] sixty-nine) is the natural number following 168 and preceding 170.

==In mathematics==
169 is an odd number, a composite number, and a deficient number.

169 is a square number: 13 × 13 = 169, and if each number is reversed the equation is still true: 31 × 31 = 961. 144 shares this property: 12 × 12 = 144, 21 × 21 = 441.

169 is one of the few squares to also be a centered hexagonal number. Like all odd squares, it is a centered octagonal number. 169 is an odd-indexed Pell number, thus it is also a Markov number, appearing in the solutions (2, 169, 985), (2, 29, 169), (29, 169, 14701), etc. 169 is the sum of seven consecutive primes: 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 + 31 + 37. 169 is a difference in consecutive cubes, equaling formula_1

==In other fields==
* 169 is known in the computing world as the first number of an automatic IPv4 address assigned by TCP/IP when no external networking device is contactable

<doc id="467772" wikidata="Q2335758" url="?curid=467772" title="Gulf Air Flight 771">
<text>Gulf Air Flight 771 was a flight from Karachi, Pakistan, to Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. On 23 September 1983, while the Boeing 737-2P6 was on approach to Abu Dhabi International Airport, a bomb planted by Palestinian nationalist militant group, Abu Nidal Organization, exploded in the baggage compartment. The plane crashed in the desert near Jebel Ali between Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the UAE. All five crew members and 107 passengers died. To date, it is the deadliest air disaster in the history of the United Arab Emirates along with Sterling Airways Flight 296 which also killed 112 in 1972.

==Crew and passengers==
The flight&#x27;s cockpit crew consisted of the following:

* Omani Captain Saud al-Kindi
* Bahraini First Officer Khazal al-Qadi

The cabin crew were of mixed nationalities, ranging from Filipino, Indian, Pakistani, and American; the sole Bahraini member, Hashim Sayed Abdullah, acted as a deputy purser and worked in the economy class cabin. Two of the crew were from the United Kingdom; one of them, Sally Anne Townsend, was a native of Peterborough, serving as chief purser on the flight. 

There were 96 Pakistani nationals, many returning to jobs in Abu Dhabi and Bahrain after spending the Eid al Adha holiday with their families in Pakistan. There were also seven passengers from the United Kingdom, one from the United States, and one from Iran.

== Bombing ==
On September 23, 1983, Gulf Air Flight 771 An Boeing 737-2P6 with registration number A40-BK, was scheduled to fly from Karachi, Pakistan to Manama, Bahrain via Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

Shortly after takeoff, the aircraft experienced an explosive detonation in the baggage compartment during approach to Abu Dhabi. The aircraft did not break apart in mid-air, but a fire broke out immediately afterwards and the passengers are believed to have been killed instantly by Asphyxiation. As a result, the aircraft crashed into the desert near Jebel Ali, about 50 km northeast of Abu Dhabi. All 112 people on board, including five crew members and 107 passengers, were killed in the accident.

==Investigation==
The investigation was carried out by the American National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and they released a 400-page report on their findings, which was not immediately published in the Persian Gulf region. The report was revealed in September 1987 by British politician Sir Dudley Smith, under pressure from the parents of Lyn Farthing, one of the two British flight attendants who perished in the crash. 

The report included a description of the last moments in the cockpit, including a description of Omani captain Saoud Al Kindy praying as the plane nose-dived into the desert. The report mentioned that everything on board the flight was perfectly normal and voice transcripts showed the crew chatting among themselves. One asked the other if he was on duty the next day, to which he replied &quot;No, I&#x27;ve got a day off tomorrow&quot;. That was followed by a sudden interruption and the recording showed the pilots making a frantic attempt to control the plane.

The report indicated a bomb in the baggage hold as the primary cause of the accident, due to the following factors:

* A passenger who checked in baggage at Karachi but never boarded the plane.
* The nature of injuries to passengers who were seated above the baggage hold.
* A sudden interruption to an otherwise normally operating flight.
* Data obtained from the aircraft&#x27;s flight data recorder.

==Aftermath==
The bomb was apparently planted by the Abu Nidal Organization (named after Abu Nidal himself), to convince Saudi Arabia to pay protection money to Nidal so as to avoid attacks on their soil.

As of January 2022, Gulf Air still uses the flight number 771, operating scheduled services between Islamabad and Bahrain.

<text>The Bavarian People&#x27;s Party (German: ; BVP) was a principally Catholic christian democratic political party in Bavaria during the Weimar Republic. After the collapse of the German Empire in 1918, it split away from the federal Centre Party and formed the BVP in order to pursue a conservative and regionalist stance. It dominated in state politics; all Ministers-President from 1920 onwards were from the BVP. In the national Reichstag it remained a minor player with only about three percent of total votes in all elections. The BVP disbanded shortly after the Nazi seizure of power in early 1933. It was not reformed after the war; much of its electorate was absorbed by the new centre-right regionalist Christian Social Union in Bavaria.

== Founding ==
There had been a Bavarian wing of the Centre Party throughout the years of the German Empire. After Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I and the outbreak of the German Revolution of 1918–1919, leading Bavarian members of the Centre Party around Georg Heim founded the Bavarian People&#x27;s Party in Regensburg on 12 November 1918 as the Catholic political agent in Bavaria. Two main factors drove the split from the Centre Party. The first was the Bavarian representatives&#x27; strong federalism, in contrast to the national Centre Party under Matthias Erzberger, which tended towards centralization. The second factor was the Bavarians&#x27; more conservative stance and negative assessment of the then-proceeding revolution guided (at least initially) by the Social Democratic Party (SPD). The founding members of the BVP included the party&#x27;s agrarian wing and, despite initial skepticism, the workers&#x27; representatives. The BVP&#x27;s programme called for a decentralized federal parliamentary system, the abolition of &quot;Prussian supremacy&quot;, women&#x27;s suffrage and the introduction of plebiscites. At the party level it strove for a corporative structure, with a &quot;farmers&#x27; chamber&quot; () as the first step. Half of all committee members and parliamentary candidates at both the national and local level had to be members of BVP-affiliated professional organizations. Party leadership was drawn mostly from clerics, the former nobility and the middle class.

== Electoral results ==
The BVP, with about 55,000 members and 2,500 local chapters, was the most widely elected party in all five Bavarian state elections during the Weimar Republic and was represented in all state governments. Most were coalitions with the Bavarian Peasants&#x27; League () and the Protestant Bavarian Middle Party (), which after 1920 was the Bavarian branch of the strongly nationalist German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP). The BVP provided the minister president four times: Gustav Ritter von Kahr (1920–1921), Hugo Graf von Lerchenfeld (1921–1922), Eugen von Knilling (1922–1924) and Heinrich Held (1924–1933). Kahr and Lerchenfeld had only loose ties to party.

At the national level, the BVP and the Centre formed an electoral alliance for the January 1919 election to the Weimar National Assembly that drew up the Weimar Constitution and served as Germany&#x27;s interim parliament until the new constitution went into effect. The two parties also had a joint parliamentary group until 1920. After that the relationship between the sister parties deteriorated and led to competitive candidacies in some elections, although from 1927 on there was again a rapprochement.

The BVP participated in various national governments and provided ministers in the cabinets of Wilhelm Cuno, Wilhelm Marx (first, third and fourth cabinets), Hans Luther (first) and second cabinets), Hermann Müller (second cabinet), and Heinrich Brüning (first) and second cabinets). Erich Emminger was the highest ranking, serving as the Reich minister of justice in 1923–1924.
== Political activity ==

BVP Minister President Kahr was responsible for the idea of establishing Bavaria as an (cell of order) within the &quot;Marxist chaos&quot; and completely &quot;Judaized&quot; Weimar Republic. He also fostered the growth of the Civil Guard (&quot;Einwohnerwehr&quot;), which was similar to the Freikorps. Kahr resigned as minister president in 1921 when the Law for the Protection of the Republic forced the Civil Guards to disarm. In 1923 Minister President Knilling appointed Kahr state commissioner general () with dictatorial powers. After Kahr immediately imposed a state of emergency in Bavaria, the government in Berlin did the same for all of Germany. Kahr then stopped enforcing the Law for the Protection of the Republic, which increased the punishments for politically motivated acts of violence and banned organizations that opposed the &quot;constitutional republican form of government&quot; along with their printed matter and meetings. In spite of his right-wing stances, he helped put down Adolf Hitler&#x27;s November 1923 Beer Hall Putsch. Under pressure from Berlin, Kahr was forced to resign as state commissioner general two months later.

The (Bavaria Watch), the uniformed paramilitary unit of the Bavarian People&#x27;s Party, was formed in 1925. It disbanded itself in April 1933.

After the stabilization of the political situation in Germany, the BVP pursued a more moderate course under the leadership of Minister President Heinrich Held (1924–1933) and party president Fritz Schäffer. Under Held, the Bavarian conflicts with the Reich government ended, the economy stabilized, the state administration was reformed and infrastructure expanded. At the national level, the BVP voted in 1925 against Centre Party Reich presidential candidate Wilhelm Marx and for Paul von Hindenburg since it feared socialist-driven centralization.

== Rise of the Nazi Party and end of the BVP ==
The strong upsurge of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) that began in 1930 did not affect the BVP to the same extent as other middle class parties – the German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP), German People&#x27;s Party (DVP) and the German Democratic Party (DDP; later DStP) – since it had a rural Catholic core electorate with solid local structures that proved largely resistant to the emerging National Socialist movement. Heinrich Himmler, who had been a member since 1919, resigned from the BVP in 1923.

After the Nazi Party seized power in January 1933, all 19 BVP deputies in the Reichstag voted for the Enabling Act of 1933 that gave Hitler as chancellor the power to make and enforce laws without involving the Reichstag. The Bavarian government underwent &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; () – essentially Nazification – on 10 April 1933. On the same day, Reich Interior Minister Wilhem Frick named General Franz Ritter von Epp as &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; (Reich governor) of Bavaria, and Minister President Held was forced out of office. The BVP, many of whose members had been arrested, saw itself as deprived of any possibility of action and dissolved itself on 4 July 1933. All of its arrested politicians were then released.

== Successor parties ==

The Christian Social Union (CSU) and the Bavaria Party were founded after the Second World War. In programmatic terms they can be seen in part as successor organizations to the BVP, but the CSU is not a legal continuation or successor party to the BVP. From 1945 it absorbed most of the German nationalist camp in Bavaria: the (Bavarian Middle Party), which in the Weimar Republic was the Bavarian offshoot of the nationalist German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP), parts of the Bavarian Peasants&#x27; League and of the urban liberal middle classes. The same was true of the Bavaria Party, whose supporters came partly from the BVP camp and partly from the Peasants&#x27; League.

<doc id="467787" wikidata="Q28084" url="?curid=467787" title="Gaya confederacy">
<text>Gaya (; ) was a Korean confederacy of territorial polities in the Nakdong River basin of southern Korea, growing out of the Byeonhan confederacy of the Samhan period.

The traditional period used by historians for Gaya chronology is AD 42–532. Geumgwan Gaya, the ruling state of the confederacy, was conquered in 532, but Daegaya only fell in 562. According to archaeological evidence in the third and fourth centuries some of the city-states of Byeonhan evolved into the Gaya confederacy, which was later annexed by Silla, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. The individual polities that made up the Gaya confederacy have been characterized as small city-states. The material culture remains of Gaya culture mainly consist of burials and their contents of mortuary goods that have been excavated by archaeologists. Archaeologists interpret mounded burial cemeteries of the late third and early fourth centuries such as Daeseong-dong in Gimhae and Bokcheon-dong in Busan as the royal burial grounds of Gaya polities.

== Names ==
Although most commonly referred to as Gaya (; ), probably due to the imprecision of transcribing Korean words into hanja, historical sources use a variety of names, including Garak (; ), Gara (; ), Garyang (; ), and Guya (; ). According to Christopher I. Beckwith, &quot;The spelling Kaya is the modern Korean reading of the characters used to write the name; the pronunciation /kara/ (transcriptionally *kala) is certain.&quot;

In Japanese, Gaya is often referred to as Mimana (任那), a name with considerable present-day political connotations. However, another word called &quot;Kara (から)&quot; was used when alluding to ancient Korea, a word that is believed to have derived from the alternate spelling of Gaya, Gara (加羅) which is now represented by three separate characters: 韓, 漢 and 唐 in kun&#x27;yomi. It is thought that the meaning of &quot;Korea&quot; was initially preserved in Japanese in the word &quot;Kara&quot; which later expanded to include &quot;China, then mainland East Asia&quot; and, more recently, an even more vague sense of &quot;the nations overseas or foreign countries&quot;.

== Languages ==
Linguists, including Vovin and Janhunen, suggest that Japonic languages were spoken in large parts of the southern Korean Peninsula. According to Vovin, these &quot;Peninsular Japonic languages&quot; were replaced by Koreanic-speakers (possibly belonging to the Han-branch).

The later Gaya language likely belonged to the Koreanic Han languages.

The genetic diversity in the Gaya Kingdom region is linked to Jomon-related ancestry.

== History ==
According to a legend written in the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; in the 13th century, six eggs descended from heaven in the year AD 42 with a message that they would be kings. Six boys were born and matured within 12 days. One of them, named Suro, became the king of Geumgwan Gaya, and the other five founded the remaining five Gayas: Daegaya, Seongsan Gaya, Ara Gaya, Goryeong Gaya, and Sogaya.

The Gaya polities evolved out of the chiefly political structures of the twelve tribes of the ancient Byeonhan confederacy, one of the Samhan confederacies. The loosely organized chiefdoms resolved into six Gaya groups, centered on Geumgwan Gaya. Based on archaeological sources and the limited written records, scholars have identified the late 3rd century as a period of transition from Byeonhan to Gaya, noting increasing military activity and changing funerary customs. This transition was also associated with the replacement of the previous elite in some principalities (including Daegaya) by elements from the Buyeo kingdom, which brought a more militaristic ideology and style of rule.

After the Eight Port Kingdoms War(浦上八國 亂)(209~212) between Silla and Gaya, Gaya was influenced by Silla&#x27;s southeast peninsular hegemony, but diplomatically utilized the influence of Baekje and Japan to maintain independence. The Gaya Confederacy disintegrated under pressure from Goguryeo between 391 and 412, although the last Gaya polities remained independent until they were conquered by Silla in 562, as punishment for assisting Baekje in a war against Silla.

In 529, Silla destroyed Takgitan Gaya(啄己呑國) under the pretext of its alliance with Daegaya and took half of Taksun Gaya(卓淳國)&#x27;s territory. This led Daegaya to distrust the Gaya and begin uniting around the Ara Gaya, which was maintaining a strong power. In order to escape interference between Baekje and Silla in Gaya, the Ara Gaya invited Silla, Baekje, and Japan to hold the Anra Conference(安羅會議). Although they wanted to pressure Silla through the meeting to rebuild the Takgitan Gaya(啄己呑國) and raise the international status of Anra, Baekje preferred strong diplomacy and Silla was not interested in it. Although Japan was pro-Anra Gaya, it was unable to help due to internal problems.

In 541 and 544, Baekje led the Sabi Conferences (泗沘會議), which were participated in by seven countries including Ara. However, Ara still did not fully trust in Baekje. As a result of the conference, Gaya attacked Goguryeo alongside the Silla-Baekje alliance and acquired Seoul. In this attack, Baekje was betrayed by Silla and Gaya was also absorbed by Silla.

== Economy ==
Polities were situated in the alluvial flats of tributary river valleys and the mouth of the Nakdong. In particular, the mouth of the Nakdong has fertile plains, direct access to the sea, and rich iron deposits. Gaya polities had economies that were based on agriculture, fishing, casting, and long-distance trade. They were particularly known for its iron-working, as Byeonhan had been before it. Gaya polities exported abundant quantities of iron ore, iron armor, and other weaponry to Baekje and the Kingdom of Wa. In contrast to the largely commercial and non-political ties of Byeonhan, Gaya polities seem to have attempted to maintain strong political ties with those kingdoms as well.

== Politics ==
Several ancient historical records list a number of polities of Gaya. For example, Goryeo Saryak () lists five: Geumgwan Gaya, Goryeong Gaya, Bihwa Gaya, Ara Gaya, and Seongsan Gaya.

Traditionally, the Gaya Confederacy enjoyed good relations with Japan and Baekje, such as when the three states allied against Goguryeo and Silla in the Goguryeo-Wa War. Records indicate Gaya would, alongside Baekje, regularly send economic, cultural, and technological aid to Japan in exchange for military and political aid, as the Yamato court desired technological progress and cultural advancement while Baekje and the Gaya states desired Japan&#x27;s military aid in their wars against Silla and Goguryeo.

The various Gaya polities formed a confederacy in the 2nd and 3rd centuries that was centered on the heartland of Geumgwan Gaya in modern Gimhae. After a period of decline, the confederacy was revived around the turn of the 5th and 6th centuries, this time centered on Daegaya of modern Goryeong. However, it was unable to defend itself against the incursions and attacks of the neighboring kingdom of Silla. Eventually, all of the Gaya Confederacy was absorbed into Silla.

After the fall of the Gaya Confederacy, many of the nobility and elite of the confederated states were integrated into the ranks of Silla&#x27;s bone-rank system including the royal houses of the defeated Gaya Confederacy. One such example was the Sillan General Kim Yu-sin who played a critical role in the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Kim was the great-grandchild of King Guhae of Geumgwan Gaya, the last ruler of the Geumgwan Gaya state. As a result, Kim was given the rank of &quot;true bone&quot; which was the second highest rank one could attain, in part because the royal family of Geungwan Gaya, the Gimhae Kim clan were intermarried with the Gyeongju Kim clan, which was a prominent noble house in Silla.

Political and trade relations with Japan have been a source of controversy in both Korea and Japan. Japanese publicists during the twentieth century looked to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, which claims that Gaya (named &quot;Mimana&quot; also &quot;Kara&quot; in Japanese) was a military outpost of Japan during the Yamato period (300–710). While there is no evidence to support this, the claim has nonetheless been advocated at various times by Japanese imperialists, nationalists and press to justify the Japanese colonial rule of Korea between 19th and 20th centuries.

Archaeological evidence suggests that Gaya polities were the main exporter of technology and culture to Kyushu at that time. The theory of a Japanese outpost is widely rejected in Korea and Japan as there were no Japanese local groups at the time that had a strong enough military power to conquer Gaya or any other part of Korea. The technology of Gaya was more advanced than that of the Japanese dynasties of the time.

Though this theory has been largely refuted since the 1970s, it remains a sensitive and re-occurring issue in modern-day.

In 2010, a joint study group of historians sponsored by the governments of Japan and South Korea agreed that Gaya had never been militarily colonized by ancient Japan.

<text>James Donald &quot;Wxb&quot; Wetherbee (born November 27, 1952) (Capt, USN, Ret.), is a retired United States Navy officer and aviator, test pilot, aerospace engineer, and NASA astronaut. He is a veteran of six Space Shuttle missions and is the only American to have commanded five spaceflight missions.

==Early life and education==
Wetherbee was born on November 27, 1952, in Flushing, New York, and raised in Huntington Station, New York. He enjoys tennis, skiing, softball, running, and music. He graduated from Holy Family Diocesan High School in South Huntington, New York, in 1970. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Notre Dame in 1974.

==Naval service==
Following his graduation from Notre Dame, he received his commission in the United States Navy, in 1975. He was designated a Naval Aviator in December 1976. After training in the A-7E, he was assigned to Attack Squadron 72 (VA-72) from August 1977 to November 1980, aboard the aircraft carrier, , and logged 125 night carrier landings.

After attending the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in Patuxent River, Maryland, in 1981, he was assigned to the Systems Engineering Test Directorate. He was a project officer and test pilot for the weapons delivery system and avionics integration for the F/A-18 aircraft. Subsequently, assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron 132 (VFA-132), he flew operationally in the F/A-18 from January 1984, until his selection for the astronaut candidate program.

He has logged over 7,000 hours flying time in 20 different types of aircraft, including 345 carrier landings.

==NASA career==
Wetherbee was selected as an astronaut candidate in 1984, and became an astronaut in June 1985. He piloted his first mission STS-32 in 1990 and commanded missions STS-52 (1992), STS-63 (1995), STS-86 (1997), STS-102 (2001), and STS-113 (2002). The final three missions were dockings with Mir and the International Space Station; STS-113 was the last Space Shuttle mission before the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster.

Wetherbee served as Deputy Director of the Johnson Space Center (August 1995 to April 2000), Director of the Flight Crew Operations Directorate (April 2000 – 2002), and Technical Assistant to the Director of JSC&#x27;s Safety &amp; Mission Assurance Directorate (April 2003 to June 2004).

===Spaceflight experience===
STS-32: &quot;Columbia&quot; (January 9–20, 1990) included the successful deployment of the Syncom IV-F5 satellite, and retrieval of the 21,400-pound Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) using the Remote Manipulator System (RMS). The crew also operated a variety of middeck experiments and conducted numerous medical test objectives, including in-flight aerobic exercise and muscle performance to evaluate human adaptation to extended duration missions. Mission duration was 173 orbits in 261 hours and 01 minute.

STS-52: &quot;Columbia&quot; (October 22 to November 1, 1992) successfully deployed the Laser Geodynamic Satellite (LAGEOS), a joint Italian-American project. The crew also operated the first U.S. Microgravity Payload (USMP) with French and American experiments, and successfully completed the initial flight tests of the Canadian-built Space Vision System (SVS). Mission duration was 236 hours and 56 minutes.

STS-63: &quot;Discovery&quot; (February 2–11, 1995) was the first joint flight of the new Russian-American Space Program. Mission highlights included the rendezvous with the Russian Space Station, Mir, operation of Spacehab, and the deployment and retrieval of Spartan 204. The mission was accomplished in 129 orbits in 198 hours and 29 minutes.

STS-86: &quot;Atlantis&quot; (September 25 to October 6, 1997) was the seventh mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station Mir. Highlights included the delivery of a Mir attitude control computer, the exchange of U.S. crew members Mike Foale and David Wolf, a spacewalk by Scott Parazynski and Vladimir Titov to retrieve four experiments first deployed on Mir during the STS-76 docking mission, the transfer to Mir of 10,400 pounds of science and logistics, and the return of experiment hardware and results to Earth. Mission duration was 169 orbits in 259 hours and 21 minutes.

STS-102: &quot;Discovery&quot; (March 8–21, 2001) was the eighth Space Shuttle mission to visit the International Space Station. The mission accomplishments included the delivery of the Expedition 2 crew and the contents of the &quot;Leonardo&quot; Multi-Purpose Logistics Module, the completion of two successful spacewalks, the return to Earth of the Expedition 1 crew, as well as the return of Leonardo, the reusable cargo carrier built by the Italian Space Agency. Mission duration was 307 hours and 49 minutes.

STS-113: &quot;Endeavour&quot; (November 23 to December 7, 2002) was the sixteenth Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station. The launch occurred on November 23, 2002, to deliver the P1 Truss segment, which provides structural support for the Space Station radiators. &quot;Endeavour&quot; also delivered a new Expedition 6 crew to the Station, returning to Earth on December 7, 2002, with the Expedition 5 crew ending their 6-month stay in space. The total mission duration was 13 days, 18 hours and 47 minutes.

==Post-NASA career==
Wetherbee retired from the U.S. Navy in 2003 and left NASA in 2005 to become a consultant. He joined BP in 2006, as a safety auditor, and retired in 2014. He is currently working as a drummer and as a consultant for leaders in hazardous environments.

<doc id="467792" wikidata="Q1473123" url="?curid=467792" title="Santo &amp; Johnny">
<text>Santo &amp; Johnny were an American rock and roll instrumental duo of Italian descent from Brooklyn, New York, composed of brothers Santo Farina (born October 24, 1937) and Johnny Farina (born April 30, 1941).

They are known best for their instrumental melody &quot;Sleep Walk&quot;, one of the biggest hits of the golden age of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, which became a regional success and eventually scored the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart when it was released nationally during 1959.

== Career ==
=== Early life ===
Santo Anthony Farina and John Steven Farina were born in Brooklyn, New York, to Anthony and Josephine Farina: Santo on October 24, 1937, and Johnny on April 30, 1941.
Their father was drafted into the United States Army while they were children and was stationed for some time in Oklahoma. After hearing a steel guitar on the radio, he wrote to his wife, &quot;I&#x27;d like the boys to learn to play this instrument&quot;.

Upon returning from World War II, the boys&#x27; father found a music teacher who gave the boys steel guitar lessons. When Santo was a teenager, he was able to get a local music store to modify an acoustic guitar, allowing him to play it like a steel guitar.

Within two years, Santo was performing in amateur shows using a new Gibson six-string steel guitar and had started receiving lessons from a steel guitar teacher who had studied in Hawaii. By the age of 14, Santo was composing songs, and formed an instrumental trio with a guitarist and drummer. This trio appeared at local dances and parties, performing both original compositions and some Hawaiian standards. With money Santo made from these performances, he bought a Fender steel guitar, one with three necks, each with eight strings. This allowed him to experiment even more, and he tried different tunings until he found ones that appealed to him.

When Johnny reached the age of 12, he began to play accompaniment to Santo on a standard electric guitar. The brothers soon formed a duo and became rather popular in school, eventually performing at events in the New York boroughs. They recorded a demo that they circulated to local New York record companies.

When Johnny turned 16, he told their father that they would be quitting school to pursue a career as &quot;rock stars&quot;, to which their father responded &quot;The only stars are in the sky.&quot;

The brothers wrote a song one night when they &quot;couldn&#x27;t sleep after playing a gig, and started jamming.&quot; The song was &quot;Sleep Walk&quot; and during September 1959 it scored at the top of the American charts.

=== Music career ===
The brothers eventually came to the attention of a music publishing company and signed a songwriter&#x27;s contract and eventually landed a recording contract with Canadian-American Records. Their first release, &quot;Sleep Walk&quot;, was credited as being composed by the two brothers plus Santo&#x27;s wife, Ann, although Johnny later said that her name was put on by mistake.

&quot;Sleep Walk&quot; was recorded at Trinity Records in Manhattan. It reached &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s No. 1 position for two weeks during September 1959, and earned a Gold record for Santo &amp; Johnny. The follow-up single &quot;Tear Drop&quot; (spelled &quot;Teardrop&quot; on the album &quot;Encore&quot;) was also successful, though their long-playing record &quot;Santo &amp; Johnny&quot; was less successful in the United States.

=== Legacy ===
&quot;Sleep Walk&quot; continues to be popular owing to consistent radio airplay as well as its usage for commercials, television programs, and movies. Santo &amp; Johnny were inducted into the Steel Guitar Hall of Fame in 2002.

The duo broke up in 1976. After this split, Johnny continued to perform as a solo artist, and is still touring as of 2021. By contrast, Santo retired from the music industry in the 1970s, for reasons he did not disclose.

<text>Kathleen Sue Spielberg (&quot;née&quot; Nail; born November 3, 1953), known professionally as Kate Capshaw, is an American former actress and painter. She is best known for her portrayal of Willie Scott, an American nightclub singer and performer in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; (1984), directed by her eventual husband Steven Spielberg. Since then, she starred in &quot;Dreamscape&quot; (1984), &quot;Power&quot; (1986), &quot;SpaceCamp&quot; (1986), &quot;Black Rain&quot; (1989), &quot;Love Affair&quot; (1994), &quot;Just Cause&quot; (1995), &quot;The Locusts&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Love Letter&quot; (1999). Her portraiture work has been shown in the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery and the Pérez Art Museum Miami.

==Early life==
Capshaw was born Kathleen Sue Nail, the daughter of Edwin L. Nail, an airline employee. 

She married marketing manager Robert Capshaw in January 1976 and they had one child, Jessica Capshaw, before divorcing in 1980. She kept the surname Capshaw, which she used for her professional name upon becoming an actress.

==Career==

Capshaw moved to New York City to pursue her dream of acting, landing her first role on the soap opera &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;. After auditioning for a small role in &quot;A Little Sex&quot;, she was offered the role of the leading lady, which is when she asked for a dismissal from &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;. She starred in &quot;Dreamscape&quot; in 1984, and afterwards was directed by her then-boyfriend Armyan Bernstein in &quot;Windy City&quot;.

She met film director and future husband Steven Spielberg upon winning the female lead as Willie Scott in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; (1984), a prequel to Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981). Capshaw starred opposite Harrison Ford, who played Indiana Jones. In addition, she appeared as Andie Bergstrom, an appealing and stern yet frustrated camp instructor in the 1986 film &quot;SpaceCamp&quot;, opposite Richard Gere and Gene Hackman in &quot;Power&quot; (1986), and starred as Susanna McKaskel in &quot;The Quick and The Dead&quot; (1987) with Sam Elliott. Capshaw also starred in the spy film/romance &quot;Her Secret Life&quot;.

Capshaw had roles in several films throughout the late 1980s into the 1990s. She starred alongside Michael Douglas and Andy García in &quot;Black Rain&quot; (1989), Sean Connery and Laurence Fishburne in &quot;Just Cause&quot; (1995), and Warren Beatty and Annette Bening in &quot;Love Affair&quot; (1994). She was also featured in the 1997 film &quot;The Alarmist&quot; with David Arquette and Stanley Tucci. In 1999, she starred in and produced &quot;The Love Letter.&quot;

In 2001, she starred in the made-for-cable film &quot;A Girl Thing&quot;, with Stockard Channing, Rebecca De Mornay and Elle Macpherson. It is her last acting role to date.

== Painting practice ==
In 2009, Capshaw began her art studies—drawing, painting, and portraiture. She turned her interest to portraits of young people experiencing homelessness. In March 2019, three of these portraits were selected as finalists in the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery’s prestigious juried triennial: the Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition. Following their selection, the portraits debuted in the exhibition The Outwin 2019: American Portraiture Today.

Her solo presentation &quot;Kate Capshaw: Exclusive Tonsorial Services&quot; at the Pérez Art Museum Miami, Florida, in 2024, derives from conversations with Miami Dade community leader Sergei (Sirj) Grant, a barber and entrepreneur, working towards financial education and justice for the local youth. 

==Personal life ==
During the production of the film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; (1984), Capshaw became close to director Steven Spielberg, whom she later married. Originally an Episcopalian, she converted to Judaism before marrying Spielberg on October 12, 1991. They were married in both a civil ceremony and an Orthodox ceremony.

There are 7 children in the Spielberg–Capshaw family.

*Jessica Capshaw – daughter from Capshaw&#x27;s previous marriage to Robert Capshaw
*Max Samuel Spielberg – son from Spielberg&#x27;s previous marriage to actress Amy Irving
*Theo Spielberg – son adopted by Capshaw before her marriage to Spielberg, who later also adopted him
*Sasha Rebecca Spielberg
*Sawyer Spielberg
*Mikaela George Spielberg – adopted with Steven Spielberg
*Destry Spielberg
On April 28, 2023, Capshaw along with Michelle Obama made a surprise appearance on stage during Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s show in Barcelona where they provided backing vocals and tambourine on the song &quot;Glory Days&quot;.

<text>Paul Scott &quot;Paco&quot; Lockhart (born April 28, 1956) is an American aerospace engineer, retired United States Air Force colonel and NASA astronaut, a veteran of two Space Shuttle missions.

==Early life and education==
Lockhart, born April 28, 1956, and reared in Amarillo, Texas, graduated from Tascosa High School in 1974. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from Texas Tech University in 1978, and a Master of Science degree in aerospace engineering from University of Texas at Austin before being commissioned in 1981 into the United States Air Force. He also studied at the University of Innsbruck and the University of Vienna Summer School from 1978 to 1979 on a Rotarian Fellowship. Has also completed aerospace-related courses from Syracuse University and the University of Florida.
He is also a distinguished graduate of both ROTC and the Air Force Squadron Officer School.

==Military service==
Upon graduation from pilot training in 1983, Lockhart was assigned to the 49th Fighter Interceptor Squadron flying T-33s. In 1986, he transitioned to the F-4 and flew operationally with U.S. Air Forces, Europe (in Germany) from 1987 to 1990 as an instructor pilot for F-4 and F-16 aircrew in the tactics of surface-to-air missile suppression. In 1991 he reported to Edwards Air Force Base, California, for year long training as a test pilot in high performance military aircraft. Upon graduation, he was assigned to the Test Wing at the Air Force Developmental Test Center at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, performing weapons testing for the F-16 aircraft. During his -year tour at Eglin, he was selected as the operations officer for the 39th Flight Test Squadron. Much of America&#x27;s state-of-the-art weaponry was first tested under his guidance at the 39th Flight Test Squadron.

He has logged over 5,000 flying hours in more than 30 different aircraft and the Space Shuttle.

After his service with NASA, Lockhart was assigned to and graduated in 2004 from the Royal College of Defence Studies in London, United Kingdom. His last military assignment was with the headquarters Air Force, A9, where he was a directorate chief for both the force structures and the analyses and assessments branch. Lockhart retired from the U.S. Air Force in January 2007 and returned to NASA in an administrative position.

==NASA career==
A test pilot for the F-16 aircraft, Lockhart was selected as an astronaut candidate in 1996. Lockhart&#x27;s two space missions, STS-111 and STS-113, both in 2002, were missions to the International Space Station. He was assigned to STS-113 as pilot after the resignation of Christopher Loria from the NASA Astronaut Corps due to an injury.

==Organizations==
* Society of Experimental Test Pilots
* Order of Daedalians (Fraternal Order of Military Pilots).

==Awards and decorations==
* Defense Superior Service Medal
* Defense Meritorious Service Medal
* Air Force Aerial Achievement Medal

<doc id="467802" wikidata="Q1140647" url="?curid=467802" title="Fastball">
<text>The fastball is the most common type of pitch thrown by pitchers in baseball and softball. Its distinctive feature is its high speed. &quot;Power pitchers,&quot; such as former major leaguers Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens, relied on the speed, often exceeding 100mph, and movement of their fastballs to prevent the ball from being hit. As an alternative to the fastball, pitchers can put more movement on slower thrown balls, or throw them towards the inside or outside of home plate where batters cannot easily reach it.

Fastballs are usually thrown with a backspin so that the Magnus effect creates an upward force on the ball. This causes it to fall less rapidly than expected, and sometimes causes an optical illusion often called a rising fastball. Although it is impossible for a human to throw a baseball fast enough and with enough backspin for the ball to actually rise, to the batter the pitch seems to rise due to the unexpected lack of natural drop on the pitch.

Colloquially, a fastball pitcher is said to &quot;throw heat&quot; or &quot;put cream on it&quot;, among many other variants. 

==Types of fastballs==

Many varieties or &#x27;shapes&#x27; of fastballs have been described throughout baseball history, including four-seam fastballs, rising fastballs, two-seam fastballs, sinkers, running fastballs, cut fastballs, and split finger fastballs. However, MLB currently recognizes three distinct types of fastballs, each with substantial variety in terms of movement, consolidating the numerous antiquated descriptors into three groups: four-seam fastballs, sinkers (two-seam fastballs), and cutters (cut fastballs). Despite its name, the split-finger fastball or &#x27;splitter&#x27; is not considered to be a type of fastball and is known as an off-speed pitch.

===Four-seam fastball===

The four-seam fastball is the most common variant of the fastball. The pitch is used often by the pitcher to get ahead in the count or when he needs to throw a strike. This type of fastball is intended to have minimal lateral movement, relying more on its velocity and vertical &#x27;rising&#x27; movement. It is typically the fastest pitch a pitcher throws, with recorded top speeds above 100 mph. Two general methods are used to throw a four-seam fastball. The first and most traditional way is to find the horseshoe seam area, or the area where the seams are the furthest apart. Keeping those seams parallel to the body, the pitcher places his index and middle fingers perpendicular to them with the pads on the furthest seam from him. The thumb then rests underneath the ball about in the middle of the two fingers. With this grip, the thumb will generally have no seam on which to rest.

The four-seam fastball is widely regarded as the main key to advancing to the next level of play. One of a baseball scout&#x27;s main criteria when scouting a prospect is how fast he throws a four-seam fastball. 

===Sinker (two-seam fastball) ===

The sinker, synonymous with the two-seam fastball, two-seamer, tailing fastball, or running fastball is a type of fastball thrown with a seam orientation that induces more downward or arm-side horizontal movement compared to four-seam fastballs or cutters. Historically, distinctions have been made between these terms, but today, they are all recognized by MLB as variations of the same pitch. Differences in arm slot, spin, and velocity cause some sinkers to exhibit more vertical &#x27;drop&#x27; or &#x27;sink&#x27;, while others &#x27;run&#x27; or move more horizontally toward the pitcher&#x27;s arm side. The unique running and sinking movement profile of the sinker makes it more likely to induce ground balls than other pitches as it sinks under the plane of the batter&#x27;s swing. Not all fastballs exhibiting sinking or running movement are necessarily sinkers; four-seam fastballs thrown from a low arm slot can also exhibit sinking and running movement due to the horizontal spin axis imparted by a low or sidearm release point.

To throw a sinker, the pitcher typically grips the ball as they would a four-seam, but with their index and middle finger parallel to the seams instead of perpendicular to them. This causes the ball to spin with two seams crossing the plane of spin instead of four.

Throughout much of baseball history, the reasons why a two-seam grip resulted in different ball movement compared to a four-seam fastball were not fully understood. While it was recognized that a reduced spin rate or altered spin axis could create the distinct movement profile of the sinker, it is now understood that the distinctive movement profile of sinkers is primarily due to the seam-shifted wake (SSW) phenomenon.

When a sinker is thrown with a moderate degree of gyro spin and properly oriented seams, the rotating seams around one pole of the baseball create a greater disturbance in the air compared to the seamless area around the other pole. This uneven drag force induces a force perpendicular to the spin direction, typically resulting in more horizontal run, vertical drop, and generally more unpredictable movement than sinkers with less substantial SSW effects. While all pitches experience SSW effects to some degree, sinkers with pronounced seam-shifted movement are understood to be particularly effective pitches, resulting in better outcomes like increased ground ball rates.

The sinker has been a staple for many notable pitchers, often referred to as &#x27;sinkerballers&#x27;, such as: 

* Greg Maddux, widely regarded as among the finest starting pitchers of all time, pitched heavily off his sinker. He relied on its substantial movement, his precise control, and its above average low 90s velocity to generate ground balls as a young pitcher. Towards the end of his career, his velocity declined into the mid 80s, but his excellent sinker helped him remain effective.
* Brandon Webb, one of the most highly regarded pitchers of the 2000s before injuries forced his early retirement, was known for having one of the best sinkers in the league. He relied on this pitch to earn a Cy Young Award and two runner-up finishes from 2006 to 2008.
* Zack Britton, one of the most successful relievers of the 2010s, threw a mid to high 90s sinker more than 90% of the time at his peak. His sinker, now known to have benefitted from substantial seam-shifted wake (SSW) effects, consistently helped him lead the league in ground ball rates.

===Cutter (cut fastball)===

The cutter or cut fastball, is a pitch that blurs the lines between a four-seam fastball and a slider. The pitcher typically shifts their grip on a four-seam fastball to the side of the ball, and slightly supinates their wrist to convert some backspin into gyroscopic spin. This alters the movement of the fastball in several ways.

* Reduces the velocity of the pitch, typically by 2-8 mph compared to the pitchers four-seam velocity, depending on the degree of wrist supination and biomechanical factors.
* Shifts the spin axis of the ball either reducing arm side movement or adding glove side movement. 
* Increases gyroscopic spin typically leading to less induced vertical movement and causing the pitch to drop more rapidly than a four-seam fastball.
* Altered seam orientation combining with gyroscopic spin increases seam-shifted wake effects inducing cutting movement to the pitch.
* Many pitchers are able to spin cutters at a higher rate than their four-seam fastball. In MLB in 2024, cutters averaged nearly 2400 RPM compared to around 2300 RPM for the average four-seam fastball.

Combined, these effects typically create a pitch slower than a pitcher&#x27;s four-seam, that drops faster with either sharp glove-side &#x27;cutting&#x27; movement or minimal arm-side movement.

Though the cutter is less common in MLB than the four-seam and the sinker, there have been many notable practitioners such as: 

* Mariano Rivera, widely regarded as the greatest relief pitcher in baseball history, relied heavily on a low to mid-90s cutter, at times throwing it almost exclusively. This pitch became notorious for inducing soft contact by cutting in on the hands of left-handed hitters.
* Kenley Jansen, one of the most consistent and decorated relievers of the 2010s, has consistently thrown a low to mid-90s cutter throughout his career. The pitch&#x27;s heavy seam-shifted wake induced cut has led to elite whiff rates, consistently in excess of 30%, against right-handed hitters.
* Emmanuel Clase relies heavily on his hard cutter. Consistently averaging around 99 mph and reaching as high as 102.8 mph, the pitch has produced extremely high ground ball rates throughout his career.

==Velocity==

The fastest pitch officially recognized by MLB was a 105.8 mph four-seam fastball thrown by Aroldis Chapman on September 24, 2010. 

Since the mid-2000s, MLB has observed a significant increase in fastball velocity among pitchers. In 2008, the average four-seam fastball velocity in the MLB was below 92 mph. This figure has climbed steadily, surpassing 93 mph by 2015, and exceeding 94 mph by 2023. The frequency of pitches exceeding 100 mph further illustrates this trend: in the 2008 regular season, only 214 fastballs reached speeds greater than 100 mph, whereas in 2023, there were 3,848 such pitches. This trend highlights significant advancements in athlete training as well as changes in player evaluation and development. 

Increasing fastball velocities have contributed to a number of trends in MLB.

* Higher pitching velocities are associated with greater stress on a pitcher&#x27;s arm, particularly the elbow and shoulder. Pitch velocity has a significant correlation with injuries such as ulnar collateral ligament tears, necessitating reconstructive surgery.
* Pitchers are less capable of pitching frequently or pitching deep into games due to fatigue and injury concerns associated with throwing harder.
* Emphasis on velocity has been criticized as encouraging homogeneity among pitchers leading to a less aesthetically appealing game. Velocity is encouraged, in part, to elevate pitchers strikeout rates often at the cost of increasing walks, hit batters, and allowing fewer balls in play. While this may improve the overall effectiveness of the pitcher, it might be less appealing for spectators who see less action.

<text>Michael López-Alegría (born Miguel Eladio López Alegría on May 30, 1958) is an astronaut, test pilot and commercial astronaut with dual nationality, American and Spanish; a veteran of three Space Shuttle missions and one International Space Station mission. He is known for having performed ten spacewalks so far in his career, presently holding the second longest all-time EVA duration record (first among NASA astronauts) and having the fifth-longest spaceflight of any American at the length of 215 days; this time was spent on board the ISS from September 18, 2006, to April 21, 2007. López-Alegría commanded Axiom-1, the first ever all-private team of commercial astronaut mission to the International Space Station, which launched on April 8, 2022, and spent just over 17 days in Earth&#x27;s orbit.

== Background ==
Son of a Spanish father and an American mother, López-Alegría was born in Madrid, Spain and raised in Mission Viejo, California. After graduating from Mission Viejo High School, López-Alegría joined the United States Navy, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Systems Engineering in 1980 from the United States Naval Academy, and a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering in 1988 from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. Designated a Naval Aviator in 1981, his aviation experience in the Navy was as an instructor pilot in Training Squadron 2 (VT-2) at Naval Air Station Whiting Field near Pensacola, Florida, at Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron 2 (VQ-2) in Rota, Spain, and the Naval Air Test Center at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. He was the first EP-3E pilot to be selected for U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. He is a graduate of Harvard Kennedy School&#x27;s Program for Senior Executives in National and International Security. He is fluent in English, Spanish, French, and Russian.

His son Nicolas starred alongside López-Alegría in 2006 in &quot;Mira La Luna&quot; (directed by Eduard Bosch). A second documentary, directed by Manuel Huerga, &quot;Son And Moon&quot;, was released in Spanish theaters in 2009 featuring astronauts Mikhail Tyurin, Sunita Williams, and him.

== Mission record ==

López-Alegría&#x27;s first space mission was STS-73 in 1995; for several years afterwards he led NASA&#x27;s International Space Station (ISS) Crew Operations office before returning to space aboard STS-92 in 2000 and STS-113 in 2002. During flight STS-92, he tested the SAFER jet backpack with fellow astronaut Jeff Wisoff, flying up to 50 feet from the spacecraft.

López-Alegría served as an aquanaut on the first NEEMO (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) crew aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory in October 2001.

On September 20, 2006, López-Alegría docked with the ISS as commander of Expedition 14, having taken off from Baikonur, Kazakhstan on September 18, onboard Soyuz TMA-9. On Expedition 14, he performed five spacewalks. On April 21, 2007, he undocked from the ISS and returned to Earth.

López-Alegría holds the all-time American record for number of EVAs (10) and total EVA duration (67 hours and 40 minutes). The previous record holder, Jerry L. Ross, had a total of 9 EVAs with a duration of 58 hours and 18 minutes. López-Alegría is the second most experienced spacewalker overall, behind Russia&#x27;s Anatoly Solovyev. On April 2, 2007, López-Alegría set the record for the longest space mission of any American astronaut. When he landed on April 21, his time in space on a single mission was 215 days (the longest space mission on record is that of Valeriy Polyakov, who spent 438 days aboard the Russian space station Mir in 1994 and 1995).

<doc id="467804" wikidata="Q1929972" url="?curid=467804" title="Partial discharge">
<text>In electrical engineering, partial discharge (PD) is a localized dielectric breakdown (DB) (which does not completely bridge the space between the two conductors) of a small portion of a solid or fluid electrical insulation (EI) system under high voltage (HV) stress. 
While a corona discharge (CD) is usually revealed by a relatively steady glow or brush discharge (BD) in air, partial discharges within solid insulation system are not visible.

PD can occur in a gaseous, liquid, or solid insulating medium. It often starts within gas voids, such as voids in solid epoxy insulation or bubbles in transformer oil. Protracted partial discharge can erode solid insulation and eventually lead to breakdown of insulation.

==Discharge mechanism==
PD usually begins within voids, cracks, or inclusions within a solid dielectric, at conductor-dielectric interfaces within solid or liquid dielectrics, or in bubbles within liquid dielectrics. Since PDs are limited to only a portion of the insulation, the discharges only partially bridge the distance between electrodes. PD can also occur along the boundary between different insulating materials.

Partial discharges within an insulating material are usually initiated within gas-filled voids within the dielectric. Because the dielectric constant of the void is considerably less than the surrounding dielectric, the electric field across the void is significantly higher than that across an equivalent distance of dielectric. If the voltage stress across the void is increased above the corona inception voltage (CIV) for the gas within the void, PD activity will start within the void.

PD can also occur along the surface of solid insulating materials if the surface tangential electric field is high enough to cause a breakdown along the insulator surface. This phenomenon commonly manifests itself on overhead line insulators, particularly on contaminated insulators during days of high humidity. Overhead lines use air as their insulation medium.

===PD equivalent circuit===
The equivalent circuit of a dielectric incorporating a cavity can be modeled as a capacitive voltage divider in parallel with another capacitor. The upper capacitor of the divider represents the parallel combination of the capacitances in series with the void and the lower capacitor represents the capacitance of the void. The parallel capacitor represents the remaining unvoided capacitance of the sample.

===Partial discharge currents===
Whenever partial discharge is initiated, high frequency transient current pulses will appear and persist for nanoseconds to a microsecond, then disappear and reappear repeatedly as the voltage sinewave goes through the zero crossing. The PD happens near the peak voltage both positive and negative. PD pulses are easy to measure using the high frequency current transducer (HFCT) method. The current transducer is clamped around the case ground of the component being tested. The severity of the PD is measured by measuring the burst interval between the end of a burst and the beginning of the next burst. As the insulation breakdown worsens, the burst interval will shorten due to the breakdown happening at lower voltages. This burst interval will continue to shorten until a critical 2 millisecond point is reached. At this 2 ms point, the discharge is very close to the zero crossing and will fail with a full blown discharge and major failure. The HFCT method needs to be used because of the small magnitude and short duration of these PD events. The HFCT method is done while the component being tested stays energized and loaded. It is completely non-intrusive. Another method of measuring these currents is to put a small current-measuring resistor in series with the sample and then view the generated voltage on an oscilloscope via a matched coaxial cable.

When PD, arcing or sparking occurs, electromagnetic waves propagate away from the fault site in all directions which contact the transformer tank and travel to earth (ground cable) where the HFCT is located to capture any EMI or EMP within the transformer, breaker, PT, CT, HV Cable, MCSG, LTC, LA, generator, large hv motors, etc. Detection of the high-frequency pulses will identify the existence of partial discharge, arcing or sparking. After PD or arcing is detected, the next step is to locate the fault area. Using the acoustic emission method (AE), 4 or more AE sensors are placed on the transformer shell where the AE and HFCT wavedata is collected at the same time. Bandpass filtering is used to eliminate interference from system noises.

Partial discharge degradation can be caused by various factors, including inadequate stress regulation, or the presence of voids or delamination in the ground wall insulation. These issues can eventually result in machine failure.

==Discharge detection and measuring systems==
With the partial discharge measurement, the dielectric condition of high voltage equipment can be evaluated, and electrical treeing in the insulation can be detected and located. Partial discharge measurement can localize the damaged part of an insulated system.

Data collected during partial discharge testing is compared to measurement values of the same cable gathered during the acceptance-test or to factory quality control standards. This allows simple and quick classification of the dielectric condition (new, strongly aged, faulty) of the device under test and appropriate maintenance and repair measures may be planned and organized in advance.

Partial discharge measurement is applicable to cables and accessories with various insulation materials, such as polyethylene or paper-insulated lead-covered (PILC) cable. Partial discharge measurement is routinely carried out to assess the condition of the insulation system of rotating machines (motors and generators), transformers, and gas-insulated switchgear.

=== Partial discharge measurement system ===

A partial discharge measurement system basically consists of:

* a cable or other object being tested
* a coupling capacitor of low inductance design
* a high-voltage supply with low background noise
* high-voltage connections
* a high voltage filter to reduce background noise from the power supply
* a partial discharge detector
* PC software for analysis

A partial discharge detection system for in-service, energized electric power equipment:
* a cable, transformer, or any MV/HV power equipment
* Ultra High Frequency Sensor (UHF) Detection Bandwidth 300 MHz-1.5 GHz
* High Frequency Current Transformer (HFCT) Bandwidth 500 kHz-50 MHz
* Ultrasonic microphone with center frequency 40 kHz
* Acoustic Contact Sensor with detection bandwidth 20 kHz - 300 kHz
* TEV sensor or coupling capacitor 3 MHz-100 MHz
* Phase-resolved analysis system to compare pulse timing to AC frequency

=== The principle of partial discharge measurement ===
A number of discharge detection schemes and partial discharge measurement methods have been invented since the importance of PD was realized in the late 20th century. Partial discharge currents tend to be of short duration and have rise times in the nanosecond realm. On an oscilloscope, the discharges appear as evenly spaced burst events that occur at the peak of the sinewave. Random events are arcing or sparking.
The usual way of quantifying partial discharge magnitude is in picocoulombs. The intensity of partial discharge is displayed versus time.

An automatic analysis of the reflectograms collected during the partial discharge measurement – using a method referred to as time domain reflectometry (TDR) – allows the location of insulation irregularities. They are displayed in a partial discharge mapping format.

A phase-related depiction of the partial discharges provides additional information, useful for the evaluation of the device under test.

===Calibration setup===
The actual charge change that occurs due to a PD event is not directly measurable, therefore, &quot;apparent charge&quot; is used instead. The apparent charge (q) of a PD event is the charge that, if injected between the terminals of the device under test, would change the voltage across the terminals by an amount equivalent to the PD event. This can be modeled by the equation:

:formula_1

Apparent charge is not equal to the actual amount of changing charge at the PD site, but can be directly measured and calibrated. &#x27;Apparent charge&#x27; is usually expressed in picocoulombs.

This is measured by calibrating the voltage of the spikes against the voltages obtained from a calibration unit discharged into the measuring instrument. The calibration unit is quite simple in operation and merely comprises a square wave generator in series with a capacitor connected across the sample. Usually these are triggered optically to enable calibration without entering a dangerous high voltage area. Calibrators are usually disconnected during the discharge testing.

===Laboratory methods===
* Wideband PD detection circuits
*:In wideband detection, the impedance usually comprises a low Q parallel-resonant RLC circuit. This circuit tends to attenuate the exciting voltage (usually between 50 and 60 Hz) and amplify the voltage generated due to the discharges.
* Tuned (narrow band) detection circuits
* Differential discharge bridge methods
* Acoustic and Ultrasonic methods

===Field testing methods===
Field measurements preclude the use of a Faraday cage and the energising supply can also be a compromise from the ideal. Field measurements are therefore prone to noise and may be consequently less sensitive.

Factory quality PD tests in the field require equipment that may not be readily available, therefore other methods have been developed for field measurement which, while not as sensitive or accurate as standardized measurements, are substantially more convenient. By necessity field measurements have to be quick, safe and simple if they are to be widely applied by owners and operators of MV and HV assets.

Transient Earth Voltages (TEVs) are induced voltage spikes on the surface of the surrounding metalwork. TEVs were first discovered in 1974 by Dr John Reeves of EA Technology. TEVs occur because the partial discharge creates current spikes in the conductor and hence also in the earthed metal surrounding the conductor. Dr John Reeves established that TEV signals are directly proportional to the condition of the insulation for all switchgear of the same type measured at the same point. TEV readings are measured in dBmV. TEV pulses are full of high frequency components and hence the earthed metalwork presents a considerable impedance to ground. Therefore, voltage spikes are generated. These will stay on the inner surface of surrounding metalwork (to a depth of approximately 0.5 μm in mild steel at 100 MHz) and loop around to the outer surface wherever there is an electrical discontinuity in the metalwork. There is a secondary effect whereby electromagnetic waves generated by the partial discharge also generate TEVs on the surrounding metalwork – the surrounding metalwork acting like an antenna. TEVs are a very convenient phenomenon for measuring and detecting partial discharges as they can be detected without making an electrical connection or removing any panels. While this method may be useful to detect some issues in switchgear and surface tracking on internal components, the sensitivity is not likely to be sufficient to detect issues within solid dielectric cable systems.

Ultrasonic measurement relies on fact that the partial discharge will emit sound waves. The frequency for emissions is &quot;white&quot; noise in nature and therefore produces ultrasonic structure waves through the solid or liquid filled electrical component. Using a structure borne ultrasonic sensor on the exterior of the item under examination, internal partial discharge can be detected and located when the sensor is placed closest to the source.

HFCT Method This method is ideal for detecting and determining the severity of the PD by burst interval measurement. The closer the bursts get to &quot;zero voltage crossing&quot; the more severe and critical the PD fault is. Location of the fault area is accomplished using AE described above.

Electro Magnetic Field detection picks up the radio waves generated by the partial discharge. As noted before the radio waves can generate TEVs on the surrounding metalwork. More sensitive measurement, particularly at higher voltages, can be achieved using in built UHF antennas or external antenna mounted on insulating spacers in the surrounding metalwork.

Directional Coupler detection picks up the signals emanating from a partial discharge. This method is ideal for joints and accessories, with the sensors being located on the semicon layers at the joint or accessory.

==Effects of partial discharge in insulation systems==
Once begun, PD causes progressive deterioration of insulating materials, ultimately leading to electrical breakdown. The effects of PD within high voltage cables and equipment can be very serious, ultimately leading to complete failure. The cumulative effect of partial discharges within solid dielectrics is the formation of numerous, branching partially conducting discharge channels, a process called treeing. Repetitive discharge events cause irreversible mechanical and chemical deterioration of the insulating material. Damage is caused by the energy dissipated by high energy electrons or ions, ultraviolet light from the discharges, ozone attacking the void walls, and cracking as the chemical breakdown processes liberate gases at high pressure. The chemical transformation of the dielectric also tends to increase the electrical conductivity of the dielectric material surrounding the voids. This increases the electrical stress in the (thus far) unaffected gap region, accelerating the breakdown process. A number of inorganic dielectrics, including glass, porcelain, and mica, are significantly more resistant to PD damage than organic and polymer dielectrics.

In paper-insulated high-voltage cables, partial discharges begin as small pinholes penetrating the paper windings that are adjacent to the electrical conductor or outer sheath. As PD activity progresses, the repetitive discharges eventually cause permanent chemical changes within the affected paper layers and impregnating dielectric fluid. Over time, partially conducting carbonized trees are formed. This places greater stress on the remaining insulation, leading to further growth of the damaged region, resistive heating along the tree, and further charring (sometimes called &quot;tracking&quot;). This eventually culminates in the complete dielectric failure of the cable and, typically, an electrical explosion.

Partial discharges dissipate energy in the form of heat, sound, and light. Localized heating from PD may cause thermal degradation of the insulation. Although the level of PD heating is generally low for DC and power line frequencies, it can accelerate failures within high voltage high-frequency equipment. The integrity of insulation in high voltage equipment can be confirmed by monitoring the PD activities that occur through the equipment&#x27;s life. To ensure supply reliability and long-term operational sustainability, PD in high-voltage electrical equipment should be monitored closely with early warning signals for inspection and maintenance.

PD can usually be prevented through careful design and material selection. In critical high voltage equipment, the integrity of the insulation is confirmed using PD detection equipment during the manufacturing stage as well as periodically through the equipment&#x27;s useful life. PD prevention and detection are essential to ensure reliable, long-term operation of high voltage equipment used by electric power utilities.

==Monitoring partial discharge events in transformers and reactors==
Utilizing UHF couplers and sensors, partial discharge signals are detected and carried to a master control unit where a filtering process is applied to reject interference. The amplitude and frequency of the UHF partial discharge pulses are digitized, analyzed and processed in order to generate an appropriate partial discharge data output, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) alarm. Depending on the provider of the system, the partial discharge outputs are accessible through either a local area network, via modem or even a via web-based viewer.

The ability to differentiate between various types of partial discharge (PD) and accurately locate them is crucial for effective PD testing and monitoring. This capability enables corrective repairs to be performed during planned outages, preventing failures that often lead to expensive outages and associated downtime or production loss.

<text>John Bennett Herrington (Chickasaw Nation, born September 14, 1958) is a retired United States Naval Aviator, engineer and former NASA astronaut. In 2002, Herrington became the first enrolled citizen of a Native American tribe to fly in space.

==Early life and education==
Herrington was born in Wetumka, Oklahoma, into the Chickasaw Nation. He grew up in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Riverton, Wyoming, and Plano, Texas, where he graduated from Plano Senior High School. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in applied mathematics from the University of Colorado Colorado Springs before receiving his commission in the United States Navy in 1984.

To honor his Chickasaw heritage, Herrington, an enrolled citizen of the Chickasaw Nation, carried its flag on his thirteen-day trip to space. The flag had been presented to him by Chickasaw Nation Governor Bill Anoatubby.

In 2014, he earned his PhD in education from the University of Idaho.

==United States Navy career==
Herrington received his commission in the U.S. Navy from the Aviation Officer Candidate School at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in March 1984. In March 1985 he was designated a Naval Aviator and proceeded to Patrol Squadron Thirty-One (VP-31) at Moffett Field, California for training in the P-3C Orion. His first operational assignment was with Patrol Squadron Forty-Eight (VP-48) where he made three operational deployments, two to the Northern Pacific-based from Naval Air Facility Adak, Alaska and one to the Western Pacific-based from the Naval Air Station Cubi Point, Philippines. While assigned to VP-48, Herrington was designated a Patrol Plane Commander, Mission Commander, and Patrol Plane Instructor Pilot.

Following completion of his first operational tour, Herrington returned to VP-31 as a Fleet Replacement Squadron Instructor Pilot. While assigned to VP-31, he was selected to attend the United States Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland in January 1990. After graduation in December 1990, he reported to the Force Warfare Aircraft Test Directorate as a project test pilot for the Joint Primary Aircraft Training System. Herrington conducted additional flight test assignments flying numerous variants of the P-3 Orion as well as the T-34C and the de Havilland Canada Dash 7. Following his selection as an Aeronautical Engineering Duty Officer (AEDO), Herrington reported to the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, where he attained a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering in June 1995. Herrington was assigned as a special projects officer to the Bureau of Naval Personnel Sea Duty Component when selected for the astronaut program.

During his military service, he was awarded the Navy Commendation Medal, Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation, Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation, Coast Guard Special Operations Service Ribbon, National Defense Service Medal, Sea Service Ribbons (3), and various other service awards.

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in April 1996, Herrington reported to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in August 1996. He completed two years of training and evaluation, and qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. Herrington was assigned to the Flight Support Branch of the Astronaut Office where he served as a member of the Astronaut Support Personnel team responsible for Shuttle launch preparations and post-landing operations.

===Spaceflight===

Herrington was selected as a mission specialist for STS-113, the sixteenth Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station. &quot;Endeavour&quot; was launched from Kennedy Space Center on November 23, 2002, to deliver the P1 Truss segment, which provides structural support for the Space Station radiators. &quot;Endeavour&quot; also delivered a new Expedition 6 crew to the Station, returning to Earth on December 7, 2002, with the Expedition 5 crew ending their 6-month stay in space. The total mission duration was 13 days, 18 hours and 47 minutes.

During the mission Herrington performed three spacewalks, totaling 19 hours and 55 minutes. These spacewalks are commemorated on the reverse of the 2019 Sacagawea dollar coin.

===Underwater laboratory===
In July 2004, Herrington served as the commander of the NEEMO 6 mission aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory, living and working underwater for ten days.

Herrington retired from the Navy and NASA in July 2005.

==Rocketplane==
In September 2005, Herrington resigned from NASA to become Vice President/Director of flight Operations for Rocketplane Limited, Inc., where he replaced Mitchell Burnside Clapp. He was also to serve as the pilot of the XP Spaceplane. Herrington also provides part-time support for the Center for Space Studies at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.

In December 2007, Herrington resigned from Rocketplane, and stated that he plans to continue doing public speaking engagements as well as work with the Chickasaw Nation.

==Cross-country bike ride==
In 2008, Herrington embarked on a cross-country bicycle ride through the United States from Cape Flattery, Washington, to Cape Canaveral, Florida. The ride took three months, from August 13 to November 15, 2008.

== Honors ==
Herrington was inducted into the Chickasaw Hall of Fame in 2002. In 2017, Herrington was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum. In 2018, he became one of the inductees in the first induction ceremony held by the National Native American Hall of Fame.

== In media ==
In 2016 Herrington authored a children&#x27;s book called &quot;Mission to Space&quot; published by White Dog Press, a secondary imprint of Chickasaw Press. In the book, Herrington shares his passion for space travel and provides a glimpse into his astronaut training and mission to the International Space Station. The book includes an English to Chickasaw vocabulary list with space-related terms.

==Speaking==
Herrington currently travels the nation speaking to students, educators, nonprofits and corporations on an array of topics originating from his unique background in STEM and aviation. He is managed by Key Speakers Bureau.

<text>Timothy Wentworth Beaumont, Baron Beaumont of Whitley (22 November 1928 – 8 April 2008) was a British politician and an Anglican priest. He was politically active, successively, in the Liberal Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party of England and Wales. A life peer since 1967, in 1999 he became the first member of either of the British Houses of Parliament of the United Kingdom to represent the Green Party.

==Early and private life==
Beaumont&#x27;s father, Michael Beaumont, was a Conservative MP for Aylesbury, and his paternal grandfather, Hubert Beaumont, was the Liberal MP for Eastbourne from 1906 to 1910 and son of Wentworth Beaumont, 1st Baron Allendale. Beaumont&#x27;s mother, Faith Pease, died when he was six; his maternal grandfather was the Liberal politician Jack Pease, 1st Baron Gainford.

Beaumont was educated at Eton College and Gordonstoun School. He studied agriculture at Christ Church, Oxford, where he joined the Bullingdon Club and founded the Wagers club, devoted, in the words of one author, to &quot;bringing back the devil-may-care atmosphere of the Regency Bucks&quot;. He graduated in 1952 with a fourth-class Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree: as per tradition, his BA was promoted to a Master of Arts (MA Oxon) degree. 

He married Mary Rose Wauchope (a cousin of Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon) in 1955, with whom he had two sons and two daughters.

==Church career==
After graduating from Oxford, he trained for holy orders at Westcott House, Cambridge, an liberal Anglo-Catholic theological college. He was ordained as a deacon in 1955 and as a priest in 1956. He became an Anglican priest in Kowloon, Hong Kong. He served as assistant chaplain at St John&#x27;s Cathedral in Hong Kong from 1955 to 1957 and then was vicar of Christ Church, Kowloon Tong, until 1959. 

Having received a substantial inheritance in that year, he returned to England to live in Mayfair and then Hampstead. Meanwhile, he was an honorary curate at St Stephen&#x27;s Church in Rochester Row, Westminster, from 1960 to 1963. He represented the Diocese of London in the Church Assembly from 1960 to 1965. He became involved in church reform, supporting the Parish and People movement. He was owner of the political weekly &quot;Time and Tide&quot; and then the church reform magazine &quot;Prism&quot; (later &quot;New Christian&quot;, which merged with &quot;American Christian Century&quot;). Considering his views and lifestyle incompatible with his position as a priest, he resigned from active ministry in 1973. In 1984, however, he returned to active ministry and became priest-in-charge of St Philip and All Saints with St Luke, Kew in the Diocese of Southwark, and then retired to Clapham in 1991.

The Mary Rose School, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, a special school for students with severe and complex learning needs, is named after his wife.

==Political career==
After making a substantial donation to the Liberal Party, he became its joint honorary treasurer in 1962–1963. He was made a Liberal Life peer as Baron Beaumont of Whitley, of Child&#x27;s Hill in Greater London, in 1967. He was chair of the Liberal Party in 1967–1968 and then President in 1969–1970. In Parliament he was Liberal spokesman on education and the arts until 1986. He also served as leader of the Liberals in the Council of Europe. He was co-ordinator of the Green Alliance from 1978 to 1980.

He joined the Liberal Democrats, but, objecting to their support for free trade, he moved to the Green Party in 1999, and became the Green Party spokesman on agriculture. He stood for election to Lambeth Council for the Green Party in Clapham Common ward in 2006.

Beaumont was a Eurosceptic, and for many years he was a vice-president of the cross-party Campaign for an Independent Britain, which campaigned against British membership of the European Union.

In a memorable action, Beaumont put forth in May 1996 a bill to &quot;draw up a plan to prohibit piped music and the showing of television programmes in the public areas of hospitals and on public transport; and to require the wearing of headphones by persons listening to music in the public areas of hospitals and on public transport.&quot;

==Other achievements==
Beaumont was a patron of transgender equality campaign group Press for Change. He was chairman of the Albany Trust between 1969 and 1971, chairman of the Institute of Research into Mental and Multiple Handicap between 1971 and 1973, president of the British Federation of Film Societies between 1973 and 1979, and a member of the executive of Church Action on Poverty. He was chairman of &quot;Exit&quot; (as the Voluntary Euthanasia Society, since 2005 Dignity in Dying, was known in the early 1980s) in 1980. He edited &quot;The Selective Ego&quot;, an abridged volume of the diaries of James Agate, published in 1976, and a &quot;Liberal Cookbook&quot;, published in 1972. He also wrote a food column for the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; from 1976 to 1980, and wrote the book &quot;The End of the Yellowbrick Road&quot;, published in 1997.

Baron Beaumont of Whitley died at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in London after being hospitalised for several weeks.

<text>William Henry King (June 3, 1863November 27, 1949) was an American lawyer, politician, and jurist from Salt Lake City, Utah. As a Democrat, King represented Utah in the United States Senate from 1917 until 1941.

==Life==
King was born in Fillmore, Utah Territory to Josephine (née Henry) and William King. He graduated from Brigham Young Academy in Provo, Utah and attended the University of Deseret (now University of Utah) in Salt Lake City. He served as a missionary of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Great Britain from 1880 to 1883.

After holding local offices and serving two terms in the territorial legislature, he graduated from the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. He later joined the Utah bar and practiced law. He held other territorial offices and was appointed as an associate justice of the Utah Supreme Court, serving between 1894 and 1896.

After Utah became a state in 1896, King was elected to the United States House of Representatives and served in the 55th Congress from March 4, 1897 to March 3, 1899. He was not nominated for a second term, but when his replacement, B. H. Roberts, was denied his seat because he was a polygamist, King was elected to complete Roberts&#x27;s term. He served from April 2, 1900 to March 3, 1901. He ran for the same position in 1900 and again in 1902, but lost both times.

King was elected to the United States Senate four times, serving between March 4, 1917 and January 3, 1941. In 1918 and 1919, he served on the Overman Committee, which investigated seditious pro-German activity during World War I and Bolshevik-inspired anti-Americanism in the months following the war&#x27;s end.

Though a Democrat, King was somewhat independent of the popular Democratic president Franklin Delano Roosevelt; he was re-elected in 1934 on the strength of support for Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal, but he opposed the proposal to expand the Supreme Court as well as FDR&#x27;s candidacy for an unprecedented third presidential term. When he ran for re-election in 1940, he lost the Democratic nomination to Congressman Abe Murdock, a &quot;100% New Dealer&quot; who strongly supported Roosevelt.

He served as the President pro tempore of the Senate from 1940 to 1941 during the 76th Congress.

King remained in Washington, D.C., where he practiced law until April 1947. He returned to Utah and died there in 1949. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.

King was married twice, first to Louisa Ann &quot;Annie&quot; Lyman, to whom he wed in 1889, and remained with her to her death on April 16, 1906. He was then married to Vera B. Sjodahl, a daughter of Janne M. Sjödahl, from 1912 to his own death in 1949. One of his sons by Vera, David S. King, served three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and was a United States Ambassador to both the Malagasy Republic and Mauritius. One of his granddaughters, Jody Olsen, has served as Director of the Peace Corps since 2018. His paternal first cousin, Culbert Olson, was a Governor of California.

King was a direct descendant of Edmund Rice, his family&#x27;s English immigrant ancestor to Massachusetts Bay Colony, as follows:

* William H. King, son of
:* William King (1834–1892), son of
:* Thomas Rice King (1813–1879), son of

<doc id="467813" wikidata="Q850738" url="?curid=467813" title="Forkball">
<text>The forkball is a type of pitch in baseball. Related to the split-finger fastball, the forkball is held between the first two fingers and thrown hard, snapping the wrist. Due to its movement being similar to that of a spitball, the pitch is often called the &quot;dry spitter&quot;.

The forkball differs from the split-fingered fastball, however, in that the ball is jammed deeper between the first two fingers. The result is that the forkball is generally thrown slightly slower than the splitter, but has more of a &quot;tumbling&quot; action akin to the movement of a 12–6 curveball, as it will drop off the plate before it gets to the catcher&#x27;s mitt.

==Use in professional baseball==
Joe Bush, a pitcher from the 1910s and 1920s who played for the Philadelphia Athletics and Boston Red Sox, is credited with the invention of the forkball, shortly following World War I.

The pitch has been favored by several current and former major league pitchers, including Tom Henke, Kevin Appier, Hideo Nomo, José Valverde, José Arredondo, Ken Hill, Justin Speier, Kazuhiro Sasaki, José Contreras, Chien-Ming Wang, Junichi Tazawa, Robert Coello, Edwar Ramírez. Notably, Kodai Senga of the New York Mets has an effective forkball, nicknamed the &quot;ghostfork&quot;.

Roy Face and Lindy McDaniel were relief pitchers who pitched for 16 and 21 years, respectively, in the Major Leagues and were forkballers. Face started his career in 1953 and McDaniel in 1955. Face singlehandedly made the forkball a topic of popularized discussion through his effective use of the pitch.

Towards the end of his career, the forkball was adopted by Sandy Koufax, Hall of Fame pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers, to make up for lost velocity due to his arm injuries and to replace his rarely used changeup which he considered to be ineffective.

<doc id="467817" wikidata="Q2580477" url="?curid=467817" title="William S. King">
<text>William Smith King (December 16, 1828 – February 24, 1900) was a Republican U.S. Representative for Minnesota from March 4, 1875, to March 3, 1877. He was a journalist and businessman. He is best known for allegations of political corruption during this congressional term. The House of Representatives did not specify his offense, but decided it was constitutionally unable to punish him for actions that took place before he entered Congress. He did not run for reelection.

== Early life ==
William S. King was born to Reverend Lyndon King in Malone, New York, in Franklin County on December 16, 1828. At the age of 12, his mother died and he left home and became a farm hand.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
In 1846, he moved to Otsego County, New York, and worked as a solicitor for mutual insurance companies. He began a newspaper career in Cooperstown, New York, in 1852 by becoming an editor of the &quot;Free Democrat&quot;, a campaign paper in Cooperstown for George Washington Julian and John P. Hale, Free Soil Party candidates for U.S. President. He received the title of Colonel while serving under General Burnside in the New York Guard.

=== Newspaper career ===
King moved to Minneapolis in the summer of 1858, where he continued in journalism and raising cattle. He founded the &quot;State Atlas&quot;, a weekly newspaper, in 1859. King became known for his strong editorials and columns opposing slavery. Later, he helped create the &quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot;, and became a major stockholder in the &quot;Pioneer Press&quot; in neighboring Saint Paul. There are also indications that he became a principal owner of the &quot;Minneapolis Journal&quot;.

=== Political career ===
King became active in politics. He became a member of the Wide Awakes. King served as postmaster of the U.S. House of Representatives from July 5, 1861, to 1865 and 1867 to 1873. In 1874, he served as surveyor general of logs and lumber in the .

Following that, he served one term during the 44th congress as a U.S. Representative from 1875 to 1877. He refused to obey a subpoena issued by a committee to investigate the proceedings of a subsidy for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. He was asked by members of the legislature to resign, but was ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing.

=== Other pursuits ===
In Minnesota, Colonel King also became involved in railroads and related pursuits. There are indications he was among the first people to lay streetcar rails in Minneapolis, perhaps as early as 1867. Around 1870, he helped execute a contract to build the first section of the Northern Pacific Railway. In 1877, he built a large pavilion at Lake Calhoun in the city. A tourism boom was occurring at the time. He later sold it to Louis F. Menage, who converted it to a hotel. However, the hotel was eventually destroyed by a fire.

In 1869, King with three others, including George A. Brackett and Dorilus Morrison, purchased a farm in Minneapolis after the city council refused to purchase it to make a park. During the 1870s, he helped organized the Lakewood Cemetery Association and built a estate. The estate was named Lyndale Farm, named after his father, and reached south from 34th Street to Lake Harriet, allowing ample room to gather choice breeds of cattle for breeding purposes. His herd, including Shorthorn, Ayrshire, and Jersey, evolved into the best in the nation—to some, the world&#x27;s finest. King&#x27;s land, originally located in Richfield, was annexed to Minneapolis in 1867 by the state legislature. A portion of the Lyndale Farm was given to Philo Remington and King later filed suit against Remington after Remington sold his deed to the land.

In 1883, King resurrected Minneapolis&#x27;s Board of Trade and they established the Minneapolis Board of Park Commissioners. He served as a member of the board in Minneapolis from April 25, 1885, to April 1887.

==Personal life==
King married Mary Elizabeth Stevens of Ilion, New York. King later married Caroline M. Arnold, also of Ilion. He had a son, Preston, and a daughter.

== Death ==
King died on February 24, 1900, at his home in Minneapolis. Upon his death in Minneapolis in 1900, his body was interred at Lakewood Cemetery.

<doc id="467819" wikidata="Q608445" url="?curid=467819" title="Slider (pitch)">
<text>In baseball, a slider is a type of breaking ball, a pitch that moves or &quot;breaks&quot; as it approaches the batter. Due to the grip and wrist motion, the slider typically exhibits more lateral movement when compared to other breaking balls, such as the curveball.

The slider is generally among the fastest breaking balls, commonly ranging . A variation of the slider, known as the sweeper, is characterized as being slightly slower, but having more lateral movement. Pitches that exhibit qualities similar to that of both a slider and a curveball are referred to as a slurve.

== Grip and action ==
The grip for a slider is characterized as being similar to that of a fastball. Like all pitches, the grip can take many different forms, with slight variations between pitchers suiting their individual preferences. A common feature in most slider grips is the index and middle finger being in close proximity to each other.

The associated wrist motion often contributes a large amount to the pitch&#x27;s movement, and is characterized by a more supine positioning upon release. Like many other breaking balls, this motion can cause significant strain on the arm, and thus is not recommended for players under the age of 13.

== Effects ==
The slider will typically move laterally towards the pitcher&#x27;s glove-side. For example, when thrown by a right-handed pitcher, from the pitcher&#x27;s perspective, the pitch will &quot;slide&quot; from the right (the &quot;arm-side&quot;) to the left (the &quot;glove-side&quot;). When thrown by a left-handed pitcher, the pitch breaks in the opposite direction, moving from the left to the right. 

==Notable slider pitchers==

Many famous pitchers have been known for their slider. Hall of Fame pitcher Randy Johnson was well-known for his unusually fast slider, which he nicknamed &quot;Mr. Snappy&quot;. Other Hall of Fame pitchers renowned for their excellent slider include Steve Carlton, Dennis Eckersley, Bob Gibson, and John Smoltz.

Other pitchers with notable sliders have included:

==History==
The innovator of the slider is debated, but some credit Charles Albert &quot;Chief&quot; Bender as the first to use the pitch. Other players claimed to be the inventor include George Blaeholder and George Uhle.

<doc id="467823" wikidata="Q1142992" url="?curid=467823" title="Nissan Stadium">
<text>Nissan Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Nashville, Tennessee, United States. Owned by the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, it is primarily used for football and is the home field of the Tennessee Titans of the National Football League (NFL) and the Tigers of Tennessee State University. The stadium is the site of the TransPerfect Music City Bowl, a postseason college football bowl game played each December, and from 2020 until 2021 the home field of Nashville SC of Major League Soccer (MLS). It is used for concerts such as those affiliated with the CMA Music Festival each June. The stadium also has facilities to host public events, meetings, and parties.

Nissan Stadium is located on the east bank of the Cumberland River, across the river from downtown Nashville and has a seating capacity of 69,143. Its first regular-season game was a 36–35 win over the Cincinnati Bengals on September 12, 1999. Nissan Stadium has been known by Adelphia Coliseum (1999–2002), The Coliseum (2002–2006), and LP Field (2006–2015).

The stadium features three levels of seating. The lower bowl encompasses the field and the club and upper levels form the stadium&#x27;s dual towers, rising above the lower bowl along each sideline. The stadium&#x27;s luxury suites are located within the towers. Three levels of suites are located in the stadium&#x27;s eastern tower, one between the lower and club levels, and two between the club and upper levels. The western tower has two levels of suites between the club and upper levels. The press box is located between the lower and club levels in the western tower. Nissan Stadium&#x27;s dual video boards are behind the lower bowl in each end zone.

As of the 2023 season, the playing surface of the stadium is Matrix Helix Turf with an organic infill. Prior to 2023, the playing surface was Tifsport Bermuda Sod, a natural grass. The climate of Nashville and the wear of hosting a game nearly every weekend often required the field to be resodded in the area between the hashes in November, and the stadium had amongst the highest lower body injuries of any in the NFL during the 2018–2021 seasons.

On the stadium&#x27;s eastern side is the Titans Pro Shop, a retail store that sells team merchandise.

With Tennessee State being tenants, Nissan Stadium is the largest stadium in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS and formerly known as I-AA).

==History==

During the 1995 NFL Preseason, the Houston Oilers faced the Washington Redskins in an exhibition game at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville, Tennessee. At the game, Oilers owner Bud Adams met Nashville Mayor Phil Bredesen and began discussing the possibility of moving the team to Middle Tennessee due to Adams&#x27; discontent with the team&#x27;s lease at the Astrodome and unwillingness of the City of Houston to build a new football-only stadium. Later that year, Adams and Bredesen announced the team&#x27;s intent to move to Nashville. The city and team decided to locate a stadium on the eastern bank of the Cumberland River across from downtown Nashville, in what had been a declining industrial/warehousing area.

In a special referendum on May 7, 1996, voters in Metropolitan Nashville/Davidson County voted to approve partial funding of the proposed stadium. The vote, which allocated $144 million of public money to the project, passed with a 59 percent majority. The pro-stadium organization, known as &quot;NFL Yes!&quot;, outspent the anti-stadium group by a ratio of 16:1 during the campaign.

The funds would initially be raised through an increase in the Metro water tax. Much of the remaining construction costs were funded through the sale of personal seat licenses. Some money from the State of Tennessee was allocated to the project, on the condition that the Tennessee State University football team move its home games there, and with the request that the incoming NFL team be named Tennessee instead of Nashville.

The stadium&#x27;s construction was delayed when the construction site was hit by a tornado that struck downtown Nashville on April 16, 1998, and destroyed several cranes, but the stadium opened in time for the first scheduled event.

On May 3, 2010, the stadium&#x27;s playing surface was filled with of water due to the heavy rains and flooding from the Cumberland River. The flood also reached down to the locker rooms of the stadium.

The stadium received upgrades during mid-2012. Among the improvements are a new sound system, high-speed elevators to the upper levels, and LED ribbon boards mounted on the faces of the upper mezzanines. Two new HD Lighthouse brand LED video displays measuring by were installed, replacing the entire end zone scoreboard apparatuses. At the time of installation, the two boards became the second-largest displays in the National Football League (trailing only AT&amp;T Stadium).

In 2014 and 2015, the stadium hosted the Nashville Kickoff Game, a college football game featuring major NCAA teams for Tennessee.

During the 2018 season, two 20th anniversary logos were put in each of the end zones to help celebrate the Titans&#x27; 20th year in Nashville. The yard line numbers were also changed to match the number style on the new uniforms.

From 2021 to 2023, IndyCar ran the Music City Grand Prix which used a street track that used streets in Downtown Nashville and around the stadium. The stadium facilities were used for Club seats for the races.

The stadium was the site of the 2022 NHL Stadium Series between the Nashville Predators and the Tampa Bay Lightning.

In February 2022, the Titans paused ongoing renovations to the stadium, citing the rising costs and the structure, to explore the possibility of replacing the facility in the near future. They would later commit to a full replacement in late 2022, releasing renderings for their new stadium, which will possibly open in 2027.

On July 1, 2023, the stadium hosted the Monster Jam World Finals 22.

On July 3, 2024, human remains of an unhoused man who disappeared a couple days prior were located inside a tent were found in a section of the stadium parking lot that is located near the Cumberland River, foul play has not suspected in the incident and the official cause of death has not been determined yet.

===Naming rights===


During its construction, the stadium had no official name, though it was generally referred to as &quot;The East Bank Stadium&quot;, a reference to the stadium&#x27;s location on the eastern bank of the Cumberland River. Upon its completion, it was given the name &quot;Adelphia Coliseum&quot; in a 15-year, $30 million naming rights arrangement with Adelphia Business Solutions, a subsidiary of the larger Adelphia telecommunications company. However, after Adelphia missed a required payment and subsequently filed for bankruptcy in 2002, the agreement was abandoned and the stadium became known simply as &quot;The Coliseum&quot; for four years (Adelphia itself was dissolved in 2006).

A naming rights deal with Nashville-based Louisiana-Pacific was inked on June 6, 2006. Louisiana-Pacific, which markets itself as &quot;LP Building Products&quot;, paid $30 million over 10 years for naming rights. LP&#x27;s influence inside the stadium led to the creation of the LP Building Zones in 2007, located beneath the giant scoreboards from Daktronics at the north and south ends of the stadium. The concession stands and restrooms in these two areas were decorated to look like suburban homes using LP products.

On June 24, 2015, car manufacturer Nissan, which has its North American headquarters just south of Nashville in Franklin and operates a large manufacturing plant in nearby Smyrna, and headquartered in Nishi-ku, Yokohama, Japan, bought the naming rights for the stadium in a 20-year contract, rebranding the stadium as Nissan Stadium. As part of the sponsor agreement, a 2016 Nissan Titan pickup truck was placed next to the stadium scoreboard.

==Tennessee Titans==

The Tennessee Titans began playing at Nissan Stadium in 1999, winning their first 13 games before losing to the Baltimore Ravens on November 12, 2000.

On January 8, 2000, one of the most memorable and debated plays in NFL history took place at then-Adelphia Coliseum. The &quot;Music City Miracle&quot; (as it has come to be known) was a last-minute trick play on a kickoff return that resulted in a touchdown and catapulted the Titans past the Buffalo Bills to the Divisional Playoffs. It also ensured that the Titans would go undefeated in the first season in the team&#x27;s new home. The victory was seen in front of a franchise-record crowd.

==Soccer==
Nissan Stadium regularly hosts soccer matches featuring the United States men&#x27;s national team as well as by the women&#x27;s national team and visiting professional clubs. The venue was first used for soccer on April 20, 2004, in an exhibition game between the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer and Tecos UAG of the Mexican Primera División. Since then Nissan Stadium has been used for friendly matches by the U.S. women versus Canada in 2004, a return of Tecos against rival F.C. Atlas in 2005, and the U.S. men versus Morocco in 2006. The stadium helped host the CONCACAF men&#x27;s 2008 and 2012 qualifying tournaments for the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics.

On April 1, 2009, the U.S. men&#x27;s national team played a World Cup qualifier beating Trinidad and Tobago, 3–0. The match saw Jozy Altidore become the youngest American to score a hat trick for the national team. The U.S. men returned March 29, 2011 falling to Paraguay in a friendly before a record crowd of 29,059 – the largest to attend a soccer game in the state of Tennessee.

Nissan Stadium was chosen for two games of the Group Stage for the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

The record crowd for a soccer game played in Tennessee is 56,232 and was set on July 29, 2017, when English Premier League clubs Manchester City and Tottenham played an exhibition match at Nissan Stadium.

Major League Soccer club Nashville SC began playing at the stadium in February 2020, and played their final game there in 2021.

==Concerts and events==
Nissan Stadium can also serve as a large concert venue. The main stage for the annual CMA Music Festival, held every June, is located in the stadium.
===Professional wrestling===
Nissan Stadium hosted SummerSlam in 2022.

<doc id="467824" wikidata="Q4862620" url="?curid=467824" title="Baron Middleton">
<text>Baron Middleton, of Middleton in the County of Warwick, is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain, created in December 1711 for Sir Thomas Willoughby, 2nd Baronet, who had previously represented Nottinghamshire and Newark in Parliament. It was one of twelve new peerages created together and known as Harley&#x27;s Dozen, to give a Tory majority in the House of Lords.

The Willoughby Baronetcy, of Wollaton in the County of Nottingham, had been created in the Baronetage of England in 1677, for the first baron’s elder brother Francis Willoughby, who at the time was aged only about nine, with special remainder to him, the first baronet’s only brother, and he duly succeeded him when his brother died at the age of twenty in 1688. Their father, the landowner and naturalist Francis Willughby (1635–1672), of Middleton Hall, Warwickshire, had died when they were both small children.

The first Lord Middleton was followed by his eldest son, the second Baron (1692–1758), who had previously sat as one of the Members of Parliament for Nottinghamshire and Tamworth. He was succeeded by his son, the third baron, who died unmarried, and then by a younger son, the fourth Baron. The direct line then failed, and Henry Willoughby, 5th Baron Middleton (1726–1800) was the son of The Hon Thomas Willoughby (c. 1694–1742), second son of the first Baron. On the death of his son, the sixth Baron (1761–1835) this line also failed.

Digby Willoughby, 7th Baron Middleton (1769–1856) was a grandson of the second son of the first Baron, a captain in the Royal Navy. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his cousin, the eighth Baron, the grandson of Reverend The Hon James Willoughby, younger son of Thomas Willoughby, second son of the first Baron. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the ninth Baron, who in his turn was succeeded by his younger brother, the 10th Baron. On the latter&#x27;s death, the titles passed to his second but eldest surviving son, the 11th Baron. He was Lord Lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire. Since 2011, the titles are held by his grandson, the 13th Baron.

Extensive estate and personal papers of the Willoughby family are held in the Middleton collection at the department of Manuscripts and Special Collections, The University of Nottingham. They include the Wollaton Antiphonal.

The current family seat is Birdsall House, near Malton, North Yorkshire. The Middleton family owned Wollaton Hall, a stately home near Nottingham on which Mentmore Towers was based, and Middleton Hall in Warwickshire until they were sold by the 11th Baron in the 1920s.

<doc id="467830" wikidata="Q15710733" url="?curid=467830" title="Curveball">
<text>In baseball and softball, the curveball is a type of pitch thrown with a characteristic grip and hand movement that imparts forward spin to the ball, causing it to dive as it approaches the plate. Varieties of curveball include the 12–6 curveball, power curveball, and the knuckle curve. Its close relatives are the slider and the slurve. The &quot;curve&quot; of the ball varies from pitcher to pitcher.

The expression &quot;to throw a curveball&quot; essentially translates to introducing a significant deviation to a preceding concept.

==Grip and action==
The curveball is typically gripped in a manner similar to holding a cup or glass. The pitcher positions the middle finger along and parallel to one of the ball’s long seams, while the thumb is placed on the seam opposite, forming a &quot;C shape&quot; when viewed from above, with the horseshoe-shaped seam facing inward toward the palm. The index finger is aligned alongside the middle finger, while the remaining two fingers are folded toward the palm, with the knuckle of the ring finger resting against the leather. Some pitchers may extend these two fingers away from the ball to prevent interference during the throwing motion. The grip and throwing mechanics of the curveball closely resemble those of the slider.

The delivery of a curveball is entirely different from that of most other pitches. The pitcher at the top of the throwing arc will snap the arm and wrist in a downward motion. The ball first leaves contact with the thumb and tumbles over the index finger thus imparting the forward or &quot;top-spin&quot; characteristic of a curveball. The result is the exact opposite pitch of the four-seam fastball&#x27;s backspin, but with all four seams rotating in the direction of the flight path with forward-spin, with the axis of rotation perpendicular to the intended flight path, much like a reel mower or a bowling ball.

The amount of break on the ball depends on how hard the pitcher can snap the throw off, or how much forward spin can be put on the ball. The harder the snap, the more the pitch will break. Curveballs primarily break downwards, but can also break toward the pitcher&#x27;s off hand to varying degrees. Unlike the fastball, the apex of the ball&#x27;s flight path arc does not necessarily need to occur at the pitcher&#x27;s release point, and often peaks shortly afterwards. Curveballs are thrown with considerably less velocity than fastballs, because of both the unnatural delivery of the ball and the general rule that pitches thrown with less velocity will break more. A typical curveball in the major collegiate level and above will average between 65 and 80 mph, with the average MLB curve at 77 mph.

From a hitter&#x27;s perspective, a curveball initially appears to travel toward a specific location—often high in the strike zone—before rapidly dropping as it approaches the plate. The most effective curveballs begin breaking at the apex of their flight path and continue to break increasingly sharply as they approach and pass through the strike zone. A curveball that lacks sufficient spin will fail to break significantly and is commonly referred to as a &quot;hanging curve.&quot; These pitches are particularly disadvantageous for pitchers, as their low velocity and minimal movement often leave them high in the strike zone, making them easy for hitters to time and drive with power.

The curveball is a popular and effective pitch in professional baseball, but it is not particularly widespread in leagues with players younger than college level. This is with regard for the safety of the pitcher – not because of its difficulty – though the pitch is widely considered difficult to learn as it requires some degree of mastery and the ability to pinpoint the thrown ball&#x27;s location. There is generally a greater chance of throwing wild pitches when throwing the curveball.

When thrown correctly, it could have a break from seven to as much as 20 inches in comparison to the same pitcher&#x27;s fastball.

===Safety===
Due to the unnatural motion required to throw it, the curveball is considered a more advanced pitch and poses inherent risk of injury to a pitcher&#x27;s elbow and shoulder. There has been a controversy, as reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, March 12, 2012, about whether curveballs alone are responsible for injuries in young pitchers or whether the number of pitches thrown is the predisposing factor. In theory, allowing time for the cartilage and tendons of the arm to fully develop would protect against injuries. While acquisition of proper form might be protective, physician James Andrews is quoted in the article as stating that in many children, insufficient neuromuscular control, lack of proper mechanics, and fatigue make maintenance of proper form unlikely.

The parts of the arm most commonly injured by the curveball are the ligaments in the elbow, the biceps, and the forearm muscles. Major elbow injury requires repair through elbow ligament reconstruction, or Tommy John surgery.

==Variations==

Curveballs have a variety of trajectories and breaks among pitchers. This chiefly has to do with the arm slot and release point of a given pitcher, which is in turn governed by how comfortable the pitcher is throwing the overhand curveball.

Pitchers who can throw a curveball completely overhanded with the arm slot more or less vertical will have a curveball that will break straight downwards. This is called a 12–6 curveball as the break of the pitch is on a straight path downwards like the hands of a clock at 12 and 6. The axis of rotation of a 12–6 curve is parallel with the level ground and perpendicular to its flight path.

Pitchers throwing their curveballs with the arm slot at an angle will throw a curveball that breaks down and toward the pitcher&#x27;s off-hand. In the most extreme cases, the curve will break very wide laterally. Because the slider and the curveball share nearly the same grip and have the same unique throwing motions, this curveball breaks much like a slider, and is colloquially termed a &quot;slurve&quot;. The axis of rotation on a slurve will still be more or less perpendicular to the flight path of the ball; unlike on a 12–6 curve, however, the axis of rotation will not be parallel to the level ground. With some pitchers, the difference between curveball and other pitches such as slider and slurve may be difficult to detect or even describe. A less common term for this type of curveball is a 1–7 (outdrop, outcurve, dropping roundhouse) or 2–8 (sweeping roundhouse curveball).

A curveball that spins on a vertical axis perpendicular to its flight path, producing complete side spin—3–9 for a right-handed pitcher or 9–3 for a left-handed pitcher—is commonly referred to as a sweeping curveball, flat curveball, or frisbee curveball. While this pitch still drops due to gravity, the absence of significant topspin results in less vertical movement compared to other curveballs, such as the 12–6, 1–7/11–5, or 2–8/10–4 varieties. Side spin typically occurs when a pitcher throws with a sidearm or low three-quarter arm angle, though it can also result from a higher arm slot if the pitcher twists their hand, causing the fingers to move around the side of the ball rather than over the top. This twisting motion is believed to increase the risk of arm injuries, particularly near the elbow.

By contrast, a slider’s spin axis is nearly parallel to the ball&#x27;s flight path, similar to the rotation of a football or bullet, but slightly tilted upward toward 12 o’clock. When the spin axis shifts to 1 o’clock or 2 o’clock, the pitch becomes a slurve. A slurve often occurs when a pitcher applies excessive force to a curveball with insufficient finesse, resulting in a slight pronation at the release point rather than a full supination. Alternatively, a slurve can develop from over-supination when throwing a slider, leading to what is sometimes referred to as a &quot;slurvy slider.&quot; A slurvy slider thrown with the same velocity as a power slider (typically 5–8 mph slower than a fastball) may exhibit greater lateral break.

==Physics==
Generally the Magnus effect describes the laws of physics that make a curveball curve. A fastball travels through the air with backspin, which creates a higher pressure zone in the air ahead of and under the baseball. The baseball&#x27;s raised seams augment the ball&#x27;s ability to develop a boundary layer and therefore a greater differential of pressure between the upper and lower zones. The effect of gravity is partially counteracted as the ball rides on and into increased pressure. Thus the fastball falls less than a ball thrown without spin (neglecting knuckleball effects) during the 60 feet 6 inches it travels to home plate.

On the other hand, a curveball, thrown with topspin, creates a higher pressure zone on top of the ball, which deflects the ball downward in flight. Instead of counteracting gravity, the curveball adds additional downward force, thereby giving the ball an exaggerated drop in flight.

==Real or illusion?==
There was once a debate on whether a curveball actually curves or is an optical illusion. In 1949, Ralph B. Lightfoot, an aeronautical engineer at Sikorsky Aircraft, used wind tunnel tests to prove that a curveball curves. On whether a curveball is caused by an illusion, Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Dizzy Dean has been quoted in a number of variations on this basic premise: &quot;Stand behind a tree 60 feet away, and I will whomp you with an optical illusion!&quot;

However, optical illusion caused by the ball&#x27;s spinning may play an important part in what makes curveballs difficult to hit. The curveball&#x27;s trajectory is smooth, but the batter perceives a sudden, dramatic change in the ball&#x27;s direction. When an object that is spinning and moving through space is viewed directly, the overall motion is interpreted correctly by the brain. However, as it enters the peripheral vision, the internal spinning motion distorts how the overall motion is perceived. A curveball&#x27;s trajectory begins in the center of the batter&#x27;s vision, but overlaps with peripheral vision as it approaches the plate, which may explain the suddenness of the break perceived by the batter. A peer-reviewed article on this hypothesis was published in 2010.

==Nicknames==
Popular nicknames for the curveball include &quot;the bender&quot; and &quot;the hook&quot; (both describing the trajectory of the pitch), as well as &quot;the yakker&quot; and &quot;Uncle Charlie&quot;. New York Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden threw a curve so deadly that it was nicknamed &quot;Lord Charles&quot; and the great hitter Bill Madlock called it &quot;the yellow hammer”—apparently because it came down like a hammer and was too yellow to get hit by a bat. Because catchers frequently use two fingers to signal for a curve, the pitch is also referred to as &quot;the deuce&quot; or &quot;number two&quot;.

==History==
Candy Cummings, a star pitcher in the 1860s and 1870s, is widely credited with inventing the curveball. In his biography of Cummings, Stephen Katz provides proof. Several other pitchers of Cummings&#x27; era claimed to have invented the curveball. One was Fred Goldsmith. Goldsmith maintained that he gave a demonstration of the pitch on August 16, 1870, at the Capitoline Grounds in Brooklyn, New York, and that renowned sportswriter Henry Chadwick had covered it in the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; on August 17, 1870. However, Stephen Katz, in his biography of Cummings, shows that Goldsmith&#x27;s claim was not credible, and that Goldsmith&#x27;s reference to an article by Chadwick in the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; was likely fabricated. Other claimants to invention of the curveball are shown by Katz to have gotten the curveball only after Cummings, or not to have been pitching curveballs. In 1876, the first known collegiate baseball player to perfect the curveball was Clarence Emir Allen of Western Reserve College, now known as Case Western Reserve University, where he never lost a game. Both Allen, and teammate pitcher John P. Barden, became famous for employing the curve in the late 1870s. In the early 1880s, Clinton Scollard (1860–1932), a pitcher from Hamilton College in New York, became famous for his curve ball and later earned fame as a prolific American poet. In 1885, &quot;St. Nicholas&quot;, a children&#x27;s magazine, featured a story entitled, &quot;How Science Won the Game&quot;. It told of how a boy pitcher mastered the curveball to defeat the opposing batters.

The &quot;New York Clipper&quot; reported, of a September 26, 1863, game at Princeton University (then the College of New Jersey), that F. P. Henry&#x27;s &quot;slow pitching with a great twist to the ball achieved a victory over fast pitching.&quot; However, Katz, in his biography of Cummings, explains that Henry was not actually pitching curveballs.

Harvard president Charles Eliot was among those opposed to the curve, claiming it was a dishonest practice unworthy of Harvard students. At an athletics conference at Yale University in 1884 a speaker (thought to be from Harvard, likely Charles Eliot Norton, a cousin of the Harvard president) was reported to have stated: &quot;For the pitcher, instead of delivering the ball to the batter in an honest, straightforward way, that the latter may exert his strength to the best advantage in knocking it, now uses every effort to deceive him by curving—I think that is the word—the ball. And this is looked upon as the last triumph of athletic science and skill. I tell you it is time to call halt! when the boasted progress in athletics is in the direction of fraud and deceit.&quot;

In the past, major league pitchers Tommy Bridges, Bob Feller, Virgil Trucks, Herb Score, Camilo Pascual, Sandy Koufax, Bert Blyleven, and the aforementioned Dwight Gooden were regarded as having outstanding curveballs.

<doc id="467832" wikidata="Q908086" url="?curid=467832" title="Electrophile">
<text>In chemistry, an electrophile is a chemical species that forms bonds with nucleophiles by accepting an electron pair. Because electrophiles accept electrons, they are Lewis acids. Most electrophiles are positively charged, have an atom that carries a partial positive charge, or have an atom that does not have an octet of electrons.

Electrophiles mainly interact with nucleophiles through addition and substitution reactions. Frequently seen electrophiles in organic syntheses include cations such as H+ and NO+, polarized neutral molecules such as HCl, alkyl halides, acyl halides, and carbonyl compounds, polarizable neutral molecules such as Cl2 and Br2, oxidizing agents such as organic peracids, chemical species that do not satisfy the octet rule such as carbenes and radicals, and some Lewis acids such as BH3 and DIBAL.

== Organic chemistry ==

=== Addition of halogens ===
These occur between alkenes and electrophiles, often halogens as in halogen addition reactions. Common reactions include use of bromine water to titrate against a sample to deduce the number of double bonds present. For example, ethene + bromine → 1,2-dibromoethane:

:C2H4 + Br2 → BrCH2CH2Br

This takes the form of 3 main steps shown below;
# Forming of a π-complex
#: The electrophilic Br-Br molecule interacts with electron-rich alkene molecule to form a π-complex 1.
# Forming of a three-membered bromonium ion
#: The alkene is working as an electron donor and bromine as an electrophile. The three-membered bromonium ion 2 consisted of two carbon atoms and a bromine atom forms with a release of Br−.
# Attacking of bromide ion
#: The bromonium ion is opened by the attack of Br− from the back side. This yields the vicinal dibromide with an antiperiplanar configuration. When other nucleophiles such as water or alcohol are existing, these may attack 2 to give an alcohol or an ether.

This process is called AdE2 mechanism (&quot;addition, electrophilic, second-order&quot;). Iodine (I2), chlorine (Cl2), sulfenyl ion (RS+), mercury cation (Hg2+), and dichlorocarbene (:CCl2) also react through similar pathways. The direct conversion of 1 to 3 will appear when the Br− is large excess in the reaction medium. A β-bromo carbenium ion intermediate may be predominant instead of 3 if the alkene has a cation-stabilizing substituent like phenyl group. There is an example of the isolation of the bromonium ion 2.

===Addition of hydrogen halides===
Hydrogen halides such as hydrogen chloride (HCl) adds to alkenes to give alkyl halides in hydrohalogenation. For example, the reaction of HCl with ethylene furnishes chloroethane. The reaction proceeds with a cation intermediate, being different from the above halogen addition. An example is shown below:
# Proton (H+) adds (by working as an electrophile) to one of the carbon atoms on the alkene to form cation 1.
# Chloride ion (Cl−) combines with the cation 1 to form the adducts 2 and 3.

In this manner, the stereoselectivity of the product, that is, from which side Cl− will attack relies on the types of alkenes applied and conditions of the reaction. At least, which of the two carbon atoms will be attacked by H+ is usually decided by Markovnikov&#x27;s rule. Thus, H+ attacks the carbon atom that carries fewer substituents so as the more stabilized carbocation (with the more stabilizing substituents) will form.

This is another example of an AdE2 mechanism. Hydrogen fluoride (HF) and hydrogen iodide (HI) react with alkenes in a similar manner, and Markovnikov-type products will be given. Hydrogen bromide (HBr) also takes this pathway, but sometimes a radical process competes and a mixture of isomers may form. Although introductory textbooks seldom mentions this alternative, the AdE2 mechanism is generally competitive with the AdE3 mechanism (described in more detail for alkynes, below), in which transfer of the proton and nucleophilic addition occur in a concerted manner. The extent to which each pathway contributes depends on the several factors like the nature of the solvent (e.g., polarity), nucleophilicity of the halide ion, stability of the carbocation, and steric effects. As brief examples, the formation of a sterically unencumbered, stabilized carbocation favors the AdE2 pathway, while a more nucleophilic bromide ion favors the AdE3 pathway to a greater extent compared to reactions involving the chloride ion.

In the case of dialkyl-substituted alkynes (e.g., 3-hexyne), the intermediate vinyl cation that would result from this process is highly unstable. In such cases, the simultaneous protonation (by HCl) and attack of the alkyne by the nucleophile (Cl−) is believed to take place. This mechanistic pathway is known by the Ingold label AdE3 (&quot;addition, electrophilic, third-order&quot;). Because the simultaneous collision of three chemical species in a reactive orientation is improbable, the termolecular transition state is believed to be reached when the nucleophile attacks a reversibly-formed weak association of the alkyne and HCl. Such a mechanism is consistent with the predominantly &quot;anti&quot; addition (&gt;15:1 &quot;anti&quot;:&quot;syn&quot; for the example shown) of the hydrochlorination product and the termolecular rate law, Rate = &quot;k&quot;[alkyne] [HCl]2. In support of the proposed alkyne-HCl association, a T-shaped complex of an alkyne and HCl has been characterized crystallographically.
In contrast, phenylpropyne reacts by the AdE2ip (&quot;addition, electrophilic, second-order, ion pair&quot;) mechanism to give predominantly the &quot;syn&quot; product (~10:1 &quot;syn&quot;:&quot;anti&quot;). In this case, the intermediate vinyl cation is formed by addition of HCl because it is resonance-stabilized by the phenyl group. Nevertheless, the lifetime of this high energy species is short, and the resulting vinyl cation-chloride anion ion pair immediately collapses, before the chloride ion has a chance to leave the solvent shell, to give the vinyl chloride. The proximity of the anion to the side of the vinyl cation where the proton was added is used to rationalize the observed predominance of &quot;syn&quot; addition.
=== Hydration ===
One of the more complex hydration reactions utilises sulfuric acid as a catalyst. This reaction occurs in a similar way to the addition reaction but has an extra step in which the OSO3H group is replaced by an OH group, forming an alcohol:

:C2H4 + H2O → C2H5OH

As can be seen, the H2SO4 does take part in the overall reaction, however it remains unchanged so is classified as a catalyst.

This is the reaction in more detail:
# The H–OSO3H molecule has a δ+ charge on the initial H atom. This is attracted to and reacts with the double bond in the same way as before.
# The remaining (negatively charged) −OSO3H ion then attaches to the carbocation, forming ethyl hydrogensulphate (upper way on the above scheme).
# When water (H2O) is added and the mixture heated, ethanol (C2H5OH) is produced. The &quot;spare&quot; hydrogen atom from the water goes into &quot;replacing&quot; the &quot;lost&quot; hydrogen and, thus, reproduces sulfuric acid. Another pathway in which water molecule combines directly to the intermediate carbocation (lower way) is also possible. This pathway become predominant when aqueous sulfuric acid is used.

Overall, this process adds a molecule of water to a molecule of ethene.

This is an important reaction in industry, as it produces ethanol, whose purposes include fuels and starting material for other chemicals.

===Chiral derivatives===
Many electrophiles are chiral and optically stable. Typically chiral electrophiles are also optically pure.

One such reagent is the fructose-derived organocatalyst used in the Shi epoxidation. The catalyst can accomplish highly enantioselective epoxidations of &quot;trans&quot;-disubstituted and trisubstituted alkenes. The Shi catalyst, a ketone, is oxidized by stoichiometric oxone to the active dioxirane form before proceeding in the catalytic cycle.
Oxaziridines such as chiral N-sulfonyloxaziridines effect enantioselective ketone alpha oxidation en route to the AB-ring segments of various natural products, including γ-rhodomycionone and α-citromycinone.

Polymer-bound chiral selenium electrophiles effect asymmetric selenenylation reactions. The reagents are aryl selenenyl bromides, and they were first developed for solution phase chemistry and then modified for solid phase bead attachment via an aryloxy moiety. The solid-phase reagents were applied toward the selenenylation of various alkenes with good enantioselectivities. The products can be cleaved from the solid support using organotin hydride reducing agents. Solid-supported reagents offers advantages over solution phase chemistry due to the ease of workup and purification.

==Electrophilicity scale==
Several methods exist to rank electrophiles in order of reactivity and one of them is devised by Robert Parr with the electrophilicity index ω given as:

:formula_1

with formula_2 the electronegativity and formula_3 chemical hardness. This equation is related to the classical equation for electrical power:

:formula_4
where formula_5 is the resistance (Ohm or Ω) and formula_6 is voltage. In this sense the electrophilicity index is a kind of electrophilic power. Correlations have been found between electrophilicity of various chemical compounds and reaction rates in biochemical systems and such phenomena as allergic contact dermititis.

An electrophilicity index also exists for free radicals. Strongly electrophilic radicals such as the halogens react with electron-rich reaction sites, and strongly nucleophilic radicals such as the 2-hydroxypropyl-2-yl and tert-butyl radical react with a preference for electron-poor reaction sites.

==Superelectrophiles==
Superelectrophiles are defined as cationic electrophilic reagents with greatly enhanced reactivities in the presence of superacids. These compounds were first described by George A. Olah. Superelectrophiles form as a doubly electron deficient superelectrophile by protosolvation of a cationic electrophile. As observed by Olah, a mixture of acetic acid and boron trifluoride is able to remove a hydride ion from isobutane when combined with hydrofluoric acid via the formation of a superacid from BF3 and HF. The responsible reactive intermediate is the [CH3CO2H3]2+ dication. Likewise, methane can be nitrated to nitromethane with nitronium tetrafluoroborate NOBF only in presence of a strong acid like fluorosulfuric acid via the protonated nitronium dication.

In gitionic (gitonic) superelectrophiles, charged centers are separated by no more than one atom, for example, the protonitronium ion O=N+=O+—H (a protonated nitronium ion). And, in distonic superelectrophiles, they are separated by 2 or more atoms, for example, in the fluorination reagent F-TEDA-BF4.

<doc id="467835" wikidata="Q662832" url="?curid=467835" title="Big Bone Lick State Park">
<text>Big Bone Lick State Park is located at Big Bone in Boone County, Kentucky. The name of the park comes from the Pleistocene megafauna fossils found there. Mammoths are believed to have been drawn to this location by a salt lick deposited around the sulfur springs. Other animals including forms of bison, caribou, deer, elk, horse, mastodon, musk ox, peccary, ground sloths, wolves, black bears, stag moose, saber-toothed cats, and possibly tapir also grazed the vegetation and salty earth around the springs that the animals relied on for their diet. The majority of fossils found in the area have been dated to the Wisconsin Glacial Period (c. 115,000 – c. 11,700 years ago). Human burials and other signs of human habitation have also been uncovered.

==History==
The salt lick, or lick, as it is more generally known locally, and its fossil deposits, were long known to the original inhabitants of the area. The area was named after the extraordinarily large bones, including those of mammoths and mastodons, found in the swamps around the salt lick frequented by animals, who need salt in their diets. The mineral springs are created by water flowing through the underlying formations of limestone and shale, where the trapped salts are dissolved and carried, in solution, to the surface, creating a brine spring. The area near the springs was very soft and marshy causing many animals to become stuck with no way to escape.

=== 18th century ===

The site may have been visited as early as 1739 by Captain Charles le Moyne de Longueuil, Baron de Longueuil. He took the fossils he recovered back to France with him the next year and donated them to the natural history museum in the Jardin des Plantes.

On March 13, 1750, Christopher Gist stopped at Big Bone Lick and wrote in his journal:

:&quot;Wednesday 13. — We set out...down the said River on the SE Side...I met two men belonging to Robert Smith at whose House I lodged...The said Robt. Smith had given me an order upon these men for two of the teeth of a large Beest, which they were bringing from towards the Falls of the Ohio, one of which I turned in and delivered to the Ohio Company...The tooth which I brought in...was a Jaw toothe of better Weight than four Pounds; it appeared to be the furtherest Tooth in the Jaw, and looked Like Fine Ivory when the outside was scraped off.&quot;

Gist is referring to Robert Smith, an Indian trader, who may have visited Big Bone Lick as early as 1744.

Mary Draper Ingles, a frontier settler, was captured by Shawnee Indians on July 30, 1755, and taken to Lower Shawneetown. After two weeks there, she was taken to Big Bone Lick and put to work boiling brine to make salt, which the Shawnee sold or traded for other goods. In late October, Ingles persuaded another woman to escape with her and they walked over to her home in what is now Blacksburg, Virginia.

In 1762, amateur naturalist James Wright wrote to John Bartram describing the Big Bone Lick and some of the fossils there, although he had not been there himself, and had heard about them from the Indians:
:&quot;There appear to be the remains of 5 Entire Sceletons, with their heads All pointing towards Each other, And near together, suppos&#x27;d to have fallen at the same time...Their heads, of which two were larger than the rest, one of these, they said a Man Could but Just Grasp in Both his Arms, with a long Nose, And the Mouth on the underside...They Judged the Creature when Alive must have been the Size of a Small House.&quot;

Indian trader George Croghan visited Big Bone Lick in May 1765 and took two six-foot tusks and several other fossil bones, but when he was attacked by Indians a few days later, he lost all his belongings. He returned to Big Bone Lick in June 1766, and collected a number of bones which he took back with him to New York and sent to Benjamin Franklin as a gift. The bones were first examined by botanist Peter Collinson who pronounced them &quot;the carcasses of drowned elephants,&quot; who had died, according to Collinson, during The Deluge described in the Book of Genesis. Anatomist William Hunter examined the bones and suggested that they came from an extinct species of carnivorous elephant, which became known as &quot;the American &quot;incognitum&quot;. Naturalist Georges Cuvier decided that they belonged to an extinct ancestor of the elephant, which Cuvier named &quot;Mastodontes&quot;.&quot; The idea that any species ever became extinct was revolutionary at this time.

Daniel Boone reportedly visited Big Bone Lick between May and July 1770, after having been captured and released by Shawnee Indians. According to Lyman Draper, Boone &quot;examined the wonderful fossil remains of mammoth found there.&quot; On June 15, 1775, Nicholas Cresswell visited Big Bone Lick, then called &quot;Elephant Bone Lick&quot;. His diary entry reads, in part:
:&quot;Found several bones of a prodigious size, I take them to be Elephants, for we found a part of a tusk, about two foot long, Ivory to all appearance, but by length of time had grown yellow and very soft. All of us stripped and went into the pond to grabble for teeth and found several. Joseph Passiers found a jaw tooth which he gave me. It was judged by the company to weigh 10 pound. I got a shell of a Tusk of hard and good ivory about eighteen inches long. There is a great number of bones in a Bank on the side of this pond of an enormous size but decayed and rotten. Ribs 9 inches broad, Thigh bones 10 inches diameter. What sort of animals these were is not clearly known.&quot;

In 1795 future president William Henry Harrison collected 13 hogsheads full of fossils, all of which were lost when the barge carrying them sank on the Ohio River.

=== 19th century ===

In 1803 physician William Goforth excavated a large number of bones at Big Bone Lick and sold them in Europe, although the money was stolen from him. Goforth described his finds to Meriwether Lewis who wrote a lengthy description of the bones to Thomas Jefferson. Lewis visited Big Bone Lick in late 1803 and retrieved a number of bones, all of which were lost or stolen. In September 1807 Lewis&#x27;s friend William Clark, accompanied by his brother George Rogers Clark, visited Big Bone Lick and removed over 300 bones and teeth, which he sent to Jefferson with an eleven-page description. Jefferson donated some of the bones to the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris and the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. Studies of the bones allowed naturalists to distinguish between mastodons and mammoths and a few other species found in the collection. Jefferson&#x27;s own private collection was unfortunately ground into fertilizer by a servant.

Clark also found three Clovis spear points, which indicated that early Native Americans had hunted in the area. One mastodon bone was unearthed with a noticeable cut mark on it, implying that the Clovis people lived in the area thousands of years ago.

The Clay House, a resort hotel, opened nearby in 1815, offering visitors an opportunity to bathe in the supposedly medicinal salt mineral springs. It quickly became popular among naturalists, who came to find bones for museums or private collections. Notable visitors included Yale professor Benjamin Silliman and natural history professor Constantine S. Rafinesque, among others. The Clay House closed in 1830.

In 1831, paleontologist Richard Harlan identified a new species of giant sloth, &quot;Megalonyx laqueatus&quot;, from bones found at Big Bone Lick. In 1840, the species was renamed &quot;Mylodon harlani&quot; to honor Harlan, and is now known as &quot;Paramylodon harlani&quot;.

By the mid-19th century most of the fossils had been removed, and in 1868 paleontologist Nathaniel Southgate Shaler conducted an extensive excavation to remove all remaining fossils and take them to the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology for study. Despite this, Dr. Christopher Columbus Graham, at the advanced age of 93, began excavations in 1877. Graham wrote in an article for the &quot;Louisville Courier&quot;, &quot;The Mammoth’s Graveyard,&quot; that he spent thirty days at the site while ten men dug up the fossils. He collected seven barrels of bones and teeth of mastodons and mammoths, as well as buffalo skulls and the remains of bear, wolf and cougar. Graham corresponded with Charles Darwin and English geologist Sir Charles Lyell, (who had visited the site in 1841) regarding Big Bone Lick.

=== 20th century ===

In 1932, William Snyder Webb and William Funkhouser conducted an extensive archaeological survey of Big Bone Lick, which uncovered two prehistoric burial mounds and a cemetery of uncertain age.

From 1962 to 1967 the University of Nebraska conducted excavations, seeking any remaining fossils and attempting to determine the age and ecological context of the mammoths and mastodons that had died there. Over 2,000 fossils were uncovered and identified, including the bones of the giant ground sloth (&quot;Mylodon harlani&quot; and &quot;Megalonyx jeffersoni&quot;), tapir (&quot;Tapirus haysii&quot;), mastodon (&quot;Mammut americanum&quot;), large bison (&quot;Bison antiquus&quot;), musk ox (&quot;Bootherium&quot; sp.), giant moose-like deer (&quot;Cervalces scotti&quot;), caribou (&quot;Rangifer&quot; sp.), elk (&quot;Cervus canadensis&quot;), woolly mammoth (&quot;Elephas primigenius&quot; and &quot;Elephas columbi&quot;), and horse (&quot;Equus&quot; spp.). These fossils were dated to the Wisconsin Glacial Period (c. 115,000 – c. 11,700 years ago) and are now on display at the University of Nebraska State Museum. The team also found an Early Archaic spearpoint dated to between 8,000 and 10,000 years old.

Excavations in 1981 uncovered the burials of an adult male and a child, as well as a number of earth ovens and the remains of a house dating to the Late Archaic period. In 1993, an excavation uncovered stone tools, cores, and debitage, limestone tempered and shell tempered ceramics, fire-cracked rock, and faunal remains, including bison teeth. The tools and ceramics were recovered from a large pit and were determined to be Late Woodland and Fort Ancient types. The investigators concluded that the feature was &quot;established and used by Late Woodland people, and that the locality was subsequently occupied by Fort Ancient people after an indeterminate period.&quot; It appears likely that Paleo-Indian groups visited the site to make salt by boiling brine, as salt was an important trade item.

=== History of the park ===

In 1950 the Boone County Historical Society was organized and began considering the possibility of creating a park in the area. The Big Bone Lick Historical Association was formed in 1953, and in 1956 purchased 16.66 acres of land, which they deeded to the Kentucky State Commissioner for conservation. In December 1960, the Kentucky Department of Parks began constructing picnic areas, a shelter, and a parking lot. By 1962, the purchase of additional land brought the size of the park to 175 acres. The park was listed in 1972 on the National Register of Historic Places. The Big Bone Lick Historic Site Museum was constructed in 1990 at a cost of $4 million. By 2000, the park had reached its current size of 512 acres.

In 2002, the National Park Service designated Big Bone Lick State Park as an official Lewis and Clark Heritage Trail Site. The park was listed as a National Natural Landmark in February 2009. It bills itself as &quot;the birthplace of American paleontology&quot;. The park was further given National Historic Landmark designation in 2024.

==Activities and amenities==
The visitors center (opened 2004) features indoor and outdoor exhibits of fossils, American art, and a 1,000 pound mastodon skull as well as a gift shop. Exhibits provide information on geology as well as Native American history.

The park features several nature trails, including a Discovery Trail that includes a boardwalk around a marsh bog diorama with recreations of a woolly mammoth, a mastodon, a ground sloth, bison, and scavengers feeding on carcasses and skeletal remains. The Discovery Trail winds through several habitats, including grassland, wetland and savanna, and is accessible to the physically challenged.

A small bison herd is also maintained on-site.

The park has picnicking facilities and a 62-site campground.

<text>Daegaya was a city-state in the Gaya confederacy during the Korean Three Kingdoms period. Daegaya was located in present-day Goryeong County, in North Gyeongsang Province of South Korea. (It should not be confused with Goryeong Gaya, which was located around present-day Sangju.)

According to &quot;Geographies&quot; in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, Daegaya existed for about 520 years from the first king, Ijinasi (이진아시왕), to the last, Doseolji (도설지왕). Daegaya had sixteen kings from King Ijinasi to King Doseolji, but only five of those are known. The first king was Ijinasi, the ninth king Inoe, the sixteenth king Doseolji, and King Haji, whose generation is uncertain. King Haji (하지, 荷知) sent an embassy to Namje (南齊, in Southern Qi) in 479. According to Chinese records, he received a rank of the third order, one rank below Baekje and Silla.

Daegaya developed quickly and played a major role in the Gaya confederacy in the 5th century AD, partly because of its advanced steel-making craft, but its progress and that of the confederacy were limited by the neighboring kingdoms of Baekje and Silla, which were more fully developed as centralized political entities. Incidental historical records and archaeological findings indicate a highly stratified aristocratic society in Daegaya and the Gaya confederacy at this time.

King Haji allied with Baekje and Silla to attack Goguryeo in 481. Daegaya allied with Baekje to attack Silla (which, for Baekje, was in response to Silla&#x27;s breach of their 120-year truce) at the battle of Gwansan Fortress in 554, but both Baekje and Gaya suffered heavy losses. This confrontation policy alienated the other member states of the Gaya confederation, and Daegaya lost its leadership of Gaya to Ara Gaya.

Daegaya fell to the armies of Silla under general Kim Isabu in 562; Silla, having already begun to absorb much of the Gaya confederacy, had invaded Daegaya as punishment for having allied with Baekje in 554.

Archaeologically confirmed remains include Ancient Tombs in Jisan-dong. its turned out to be the tombs of the ruling class of Daegaya.

==Etymology of the name==
The name Daegaya is suspected to be first used around the late Gaya Confederacy. The name itself were also used by Geumgwan Gaya during the early days of Gaya Confederacy.

==List of kings==
Next is the king of Daegaya.

<text>A changeup is a type of pitch in baseball and fastpitch softball.

The changeup is a staple off-speed pitch often used in a pitcher&#x27;s arsenal, usually thrown to look like a fastball, but arriving much more slowly to the plate. Its reduced speed coupled with its deceptive delivery is meant to confuse the batter&#x27;s timing. It is meant to be thrown the same as a fastball, but further back in the hand, which makes it release from the hand slower while still retaining the look of a fastball. A changeup is generally thrown to be slower than a fastball. If thrown correctly, the changeup will confuse the batter because the human eye cannot discern that the ball is coming significantly slower until it is around from the plate. For example, a batter swings at the oncoming ball as if it were a fastball, but instead the ball is coming in at —this means they will be swinging too early to hit the ball well (also known as being &quot;way out in front&quot;).

Other names include a change-of-pace or a change. In addition, before at least the second half of the twentieth century, the term &quot;slow ball&quot; was used to denote pitches that were not a fastball or breaking ball, which almost always meant a type of changeup. Therefore, the terms &quot;slow ball&quot; and &quot;changeup&quot; could be used interchangeably. The changeup is usually, but not always, pitched faster than a curveball and about the same speed as a slider.

The changeup is analogous to the slower ball in cricket.

==Delivery==
The changeup is thrown with the same arm action as a fastball, but at a lower speed due to the pitcher holding the ball in a special grip. Former pitcher and pitching coach Leo Mazzone stated: When a pitcher throws his best fastball, he puts more in it; the changeup is such that one throws something other than his best fastball. By having this mindset, the pitch will have less velocity on it in addition to the change in grips. This difference from what is expected by the arm action and the velocity can confuse the batter into swinging the bat far too early and thus receiving a strike, or not swinging at all. Should a batter be fooled on the timing of the pitch and still make contact, it will cause a foul ball or the ball being put into play weakly, usually resulting in an out. In addition to the unexpectedly slow velocity, the changeup can possess a significant amount of movement, which can bewilder the batter even further. The very best changeups utilize both deception and movement.

==Popularity==
Since the rise of Pedro Martínez, a Dominican pitcher whose changeup was one of the tools that led to his three Cy Young Awards, the changeup has become increasingly popular in the Dominican Republic. Dominican pitchers including Edinson Vólquez, Michael Ynoa, and Ervin Santana are all known to have developed effective changeups in the Dominican Republic after Martínez&#x27;s success with the pitch.

One of the most famous changeup throwers of the last 30 years, Atlanta Braves southpaw Tom Glavine utilized a two-seam changeup as his number one pitch on the way to winning two Cy Young Awards, a World Series MVP, and 305 wins in a celebrated Hall of Fame career.

Hall of Famer reliever Trevor Hoffman had one of the best changeups in his prime and used it to record 601 saves.

In the 2010s, some of the game&#x27;s best pitchers came to rely heavily on the changeup. A 2013 article published by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; noted that star starting pitchers Justin Verlander, Félix Hernández, Stephen Strasburg, David Price, and Max Scherzer revolutionized the pitch and used it abundantly in their arsenal. In addition to its effectiveness on the field, according to &quot;Fox Sports&quot; changeups may also reduce the number of injuries suffered by a pitcher.

==Variations==

There are several variations of changeups, which are generated by using different grips on the ball during the release of the pitch.

The circle changeup is one well-known grip. The pitcher forms a circle with the index finger and thumb and lays the middle and ring fingers across the seams of the ball. By pronating the wrist upon release, the pitcher can make the pitch break in the same direction as a screwball. More or less break will result from the pitcher&#x27;s arm slot. Pedro Martínez used this pitch throughout his career to great effect, and many considered it to be his best pitch.

A far less common type of changeup is the straight changeup, thrown by a small minority of major league pitchers. 

The ball is held with three fingers (instead of the usual two) and closer to the palm, to kill some of the speed generated by the wrist and fingers. This pitch generally breaks downward slightly, though its motion does not differ greatly from a two-seam fastball.

Other variations include the palmball, vulcan changeup and fosh. The split-finger fastball and forkball is used by some pitchers as a type of changeup depending on its velocity.

<text>Geumgwan Gaya (43–532), also known as Bon-Gaya (본가야, 本伽倻, &quot;original Gaya&quot;) or Garakguk (가락국, &quot;Garak State&quot;), was the ruling city-state of the Gaya confederacy during the Three Kingdoms period in Korea. It is believed to have been located around the modern-day city of Gimhae, Southern Gyeongsang province, near the mouth of the Nakdong River. Due to its geographic location, this kingdom played a dominant role in the regional affairs from the Byeonhan period onward to the end of the Gaya confederacy.

==Creation myth==

The creation myth of Geumgwan Gaya is a myth about King Gim Suro, the progenitor of Geumgwan Gaya and the progenitor of the Gimhae Kim clan. This story is written in The &quot;Garak Gukgi&quot; (가락국기) of the &quot;Samguk Yusa&quot; Volume 2. This story tells that the six eggs turned into boys, and they became founders of each country of the Gaya confederacy.

=== History ===
It is the same as the &#x27;Dangun Myth&#x27;, &#x27;The Myth of King Dongmyeong&#x27;, and &#x27;The Myth of Bak Hyeokgeose&#x27; in that it is a founding myth. However, it is different from the others in terms of the sequential structure of the biography leading to birth and death. &#x27;The Myth of King Dongmyeong&#x27; and &#x27;The Myth of Seok Talhae&#x27; are structured in the ordeal of birth due to paternal infidelity and the ordeal and struggle to become the founder of a nation. On the other hand, &#x27;Bak Hyeokgeose Myth&#x27; and &#x27;The Myth of King Suro&#x27; deny both paternal and maternal lineage, but they have no struggle to rise to the throne as the founder of a nation without going through the ordeal of birth. The former can be defined as &#x27;the myth of the illegitimate child type&#x27; and the latter as the &#x27;myth of the foster child type&#x27;. From this point of view, &#x27;The Myth of King Suro&#x27; can be said to be a founding myth and a progenitor myth, as well as a myth that reflects the collective unconsciousness of the foster child.

=== Plot ===
After the beginning of the world, there were still no titles to call a country on this land, and there were no titles to call a king or a subject. However, there were nine &quot;gan&quot;s: Adogan, Yeodogan, Pidogan, Odogan, Ryusugan, Ryucheongan, Sincheongan, Ocheongan, and Singuigan, and they became chiefs and led the people. There were 75,000 people in 100 households. Each of them lived together in the mountains and fields, dug wells, drank, and plowed the fields. In the third lunar month of the 18th year of Emperor Guangwu&#x27;s reign in the late Han dynasty (A.D. 42, and the year of Linin (壬寅)), the Gyeyok event was held which is a day when people gather at the water&#x27;s edge to ward off evil in spring and autumn. There was a sign of something calling in a suspicious voice here in Bukguji, so a group of 200 to 300 people gathered. It sounded like a human voice, but it hid its form and said out loud, “Is anyone there?” did The nine &quot;gan&quot; answered, “We are.” And the voice said again, &quot;Where am I?&quot; So they replied, “It is Guji.” He also said, “The reason God commanded me was to come here to renew the country and become king. That&#x27;s why I came down here. You will hold a handful of soil from the top of the peak and sing a song and dance, then this will be the joy of jumping to meet the Great King.&quot;

The nine &quot;gan&quot;s enjoyed singing the song &quot;Gujiga&quot; and dancing as told. After a while, they looked up and saw a purple string hanging down from the sky and touching the ground. When they looked for the end of the string, they found a golden box wrapped in a red cloth. They opened the box, then there were six golden eggs round like the sun. The people were all amazed and delighted and bowed together countless times. After a while, they packed up the eggs again, returned to Adogan&#x27;s house, put them on the table, and dispersed.
Twelve hours later, the next day, around dawn, the group gathered again and opened the box, and six eggs turned into boys whose faces were dignified. As soon as they sat down on the table, the crowd celebrated, bowed, and respected him wholeheartedly. They grew up day by day and passed ten days and nights. They were 9 feet tall, so they could be called Tang of Shang; their faces were like a dragon, so they could be called Emperor Gaozu of Han; their eyebrows were eight different colors, like that of Emperor Yao; their pupils were doubled, like those of Emperor Shun. The first of the six eggs which turn into a human ascended the throne on the fifteenth day of the same month, and because it appeared first, it was named &#x27;Suro&#x27; or &#x27;Sureung&#x27; and the country was called &#x27;Daegarak&#x27; or &#x27;Gayaguk&#x27; which is one of the six Gaya countries. The remaining five became the head of the five Gaya.

=== Analysis ===
Historical research to reconstruct the history of Garakguk, literary research centered on the interpretation of &#x27;Gujiga (구지가, 龜旨歌)&#x27;, and folklore research to explain in relation to ancient rituals were conducted. In terms of literature, above all, research was conducted to clarify the literary value of &#x27;The Myth of King Gim Suro&#x27; by examining the entire context of the myth, the surface layer and depth of the text, and the entire type of founding myth. There are studies that revealed the fact that &#x27;The Myth of King Gim Suro&#x27; is an oral correlate of the coronation ceremony of kings and that &#x27;Gujiga&#x27; is an exorcism song for a ritual to ward off disaster, and a study on the specificity of the narrative principle of myths, and studies on the ritual structure of &#x27;The Myth of King Gim Suro&#x27; in the context of the ritual narrative structure of the founding myth. The psychological approach to &#x27;The Myth of King Gim Suro&#x27; is further diversifying the layers of meaning, and in particular, recently, studies on storytelling methods for cultural contents have been conducted, and the current significance of the myth is being newly illuminated.

==Rise of the kingdom ==

Gaya confederacy (42–532 CE), founded by the King Suro, originated from the Byeonhan (also called Pyonhan, Byeon and Byeonjin) tribe, and it had 12 statelets. Byeonhan was one of the 3 Samhan, other 2 being Jinhan and Mahan. According to the Samguk Yusa, Geumgwan Kaya was made of 9 villages united by King Suro of Gaya. His wife and queen Heo Hwang-ok, whom he married in 48 AD, is believed to be from an Ayuta kingdom. As a confederacy of city states, Gaya rose to prosperity due to sea port trade with Japan and other states as well with land trade with China in the north. Daegaya was an important city state and sea port as part of the Gaya Confederacy, it is associated with the place the Queen Heo had first arrived in Korea from her foreign location.

During this early time in the history of Gaya, several waves of migration from the north, including the earlier-extant Gojoseon, Buyeo, and the Goguryeo, arrived and integrated with existing populations and stimulated cultural and political developments. A sharp break in burial styles is found in archaeological sites dated near the late 3rd century AD, when these migrations are to have taken place. Burial forms associated with North Asian nomadic peoples, such as the burial of horses with the dead, suddenly replace earlier forms in the tombs of the elite. In addition, evidence exists indicating that earlier burials were systematically destroyed. In the early 1990s, a royal tomb complex was unearthed in Daeseong-dong, Gimhae, attributed to Geumgwan Gaya but apparently used since Byeonhan times.

According to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, It is presumed the four countries, Sinunsin (, Anra (安邪踧支濆), Sinbunhwal (臣離兒不例) and Geumgwan (拘邪秦支廉), had a superior position in the southern peninsula around the 3rd century.

==Religion==
Centuries after Buddhism originated in India, Mahayana Buddhism arrived in China through Silk Road transmission of Buddhism in 1st century CE via Tibet, then into the Korean peninsula in the 3rd century CE during the Three Kingdoms period from where Buddhism was transmitted to Japan. In Korea, Buddhism was adopted as the state religion by three constituent polities of the Three Kingdoms period: first by the Goguryeo ruling tribe of Geumgwan Gaya in 372 CE, then by Silla in 528 CE, and lastly by Baekje in 552 CE.

==List of kings==

In chronological order:

* Geumgwan Gaya (lit. Gaya Confederacy) or Bon Gaya (lit. Original Gaya) era
# King Suro
# King Geodeung
# King Mapum
# King Geojilmi
# King Isipum
# King Jwaji
# King Chwihui
# King Jilji
# King Gyeomji
# King Guhyeoung

==Decline ==

Geumgwan Gaya declined due to the wars with Japan and the tribes in north. Its various constituent city statelets fell one by one to Silla. After Geumgwan Gaya capitulated to Silla in 532 AD, its royal house was accepted into the Sillan aristocracy (perhaps because by that time, a major house of Silla, of the Gyeongju Kim clan, was related to the Gaya royal house, which was the Gimhae Kim clan) and given the rank of &quot;true bone,&quot; the second-highest level of the Silla bone rank system. General Kim Yu-sin of Silla (also of the Gimhae Kim clan) was a descendant of the last king of Gaya.

==History==

The title of Baron Harrowby, of Harrowby in the County of Lincoln, was created in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1776 for Nathaniel Ryder, who had previously represented Tiverton in Parliament. He was the son of Sir Dudley Ryder, Lord Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench from 1754 to 1756. Dudley Ryder was offered a peerage by King George II on 24 May 1756, but died the following day, before the patent was completed. Lord Harrowby was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned second Baron, who was created Earl of Harrowby in 1809. The Ryders derive their name and their coat-of-arms from the Ryther family of Ryther, Yorkshire.

Several other members of the Ryder family may also be mentioned. The Hon. Richard Ryder, second son of the first Baron Harrowby, was Home Secretary between 1809 and 1812. The Right Reverend the Hon. Henry Ryder, youngest son of the first Baron, was Bishop of Gloucester from 1815 to 1824 and Bishop of Lichfield from 1824 to 1836. His second son George Dudley Ryder was the father of 1) the Very Reverend Henry Ignatius Dudley Ryder (1837–1907), and 2) Sir George Lisle Ryder, KCB (1838–1905). Henry Ryder&#x27;s fifth son Sir Alfred Phillips Ryder was an Admiral of the Fleet. Charles Henry Dudley Ryder (1868–1945), third son of Lieutenant-Colonel Spencer Charles Dudley Ryder (1825–1873), sixth son of Henry Ryder, was a Colonel in the Royal Engineers. His third son Robert Ryder was a sailor and Conservative politician. The Hon. Granville Ryder, second son of the first Earl, sat as Member of Parliament for Tiverton and Hertfordshire. His eldest son Dudley Henry Ryder is the great-grandfather of the psychologist and animal welfare campaigner Richard D. Ryder. Granville Ryder&#x27;s second son and namesake Granville Ryder was Member of Parliament for Salisbury.

The family seat is Sandon Hall, near Stafford, Staffordshire. The family also resides at Burnt Norton house, a house made famous by the T. S. Eliot poem &quot;Burnt Norton&quot; as is found in the &quot;Four Quartets&quot;.

<text>Earl of Harewood (), in the County of York, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

==History==
The title was created in 1812 for Edward Lascelles, 1st Baron Harewood, a wealthy sugar plantation owner and former Member of Parliament for Northallerton. He had already been created Baron Harewood, of Harewood in the County of York, in 1796, in the Peerage of Great Britain, and was made Viscount Lascelles at the same time as he was given the earldom. The viscountcy is used as the courtesy title by the heir apparent to the earldom. Lascelles was the second cousin and heir at law of Edwin Lascelles, who already in 1790 had been created Baron Harewood, of Harewood Castle in the County of York (in the Peerage of Great Britain). However, this title became extinct on his death in 1795.

The Earl was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He notably represented Yorkshire, Westbury and Northallerton in the House of Commons. His son, the third Earl, also sat as Member of Parliament for Northallerton. His great-grandson, the sixth Earl, married Princess Mary, daughter of King George V. He was succeeded by their eldest son, the seventh Earl, in 1947. He was a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II and was in the line of succession to the British Throne. The titles are currently held by the latter&#x27;s son, the eighth Earl, who succeeded in 2011.

Several other members of the family have also gained distinction. Francis Lascelles was a Commissioner in the High Court of Justice for the trial of King Charles I although did not sign the death warrant, whilst Francis&#x27; brother was Thomas Lascelles, who served in the Parliamentarian Army. Daniel Lascelles, son of the aforementioned Francis Lascelles, was member of parliament for Northallerton. Henry Lascelles, second son of the aforementioned Daniel Lascelles, was Member of Parliament for Northallerton and a Director of the Honourable East India Company. He was the father of 1) the first Baron of the 1790 creation, and 2) Daniel Lascelles, represented Northallerton in Parliament. The Honourable William Lascelles, third son of the second Earl, was a Whig politician. His third son Sir Frank Lascelles, was British Ambassador to Russia and to Germany. Sir Francis William Lascelles, son of Henry Arthur Lascelles, fourth son of the aforementioned William Lascelles, was Clerk of the Parliaments between 1953 and 1958. Edwin Lascelles, fourth son of the second Earl, sat as member of parliament for Ripon. Sir Alan Lascelles, son of the Honourable Frederick Canning Lascelles, second son of the fourth Earl, was Private Secretary to both George VI and Elizabeth II. Sir Daniel Lascelles, son of the Honourable William Horace Lascelles, eighth son of the fourth Earl, was a diplomat.

The family seat is Harewood House, near Leeds, Yorkshire. The name of the house, like the title of the barony and earldom, is pronounced: &quot;Harwood&quot;. The family name is pronounced to rhyme with &quot;tassels&quot;. The traditional burial place of the Lascelles Earls of Harewood is All Saints&#x27; Church, Harewood.

<doc id="467853" wikidata="Q211142" url="?curid=467853" title="List of towns in Luxembourg">
<text>There are twelve towns in Luxembourg, as defined by statute. Despite the status as towns, they are not all contiguous urbanised areas. They are similar to communes, but have been given a separate legal status. There is a technical difference between the status of commune and towns, but this is limited in practicality. One difference is that &quot;échevins&quot; in towns are formally appointed by the Grand Duke, whereas &quot;échevins&quot; for other communes are appointed by the Minister for the Interior.

== Terminology ==
The officially used terms for a town in the sense of this article are &quot;Stad&quot; (plural &quot;Stied&quot;) in Luxembourgish, &quot;Stadt&quot; (plural &quot;Städte&quot;) in German, and &quot;ville&quot; (plural &quot;villes&quot;) in French.

All of these terms may be translated as either &quot;town&quot; or &quot;city&quot;. However, apart from the capital, Luxembourg City, and Esch-sur-Alzette, most of the places have none of the qualities that would award them the status of a &quot;city&quot; according to English usage.

== History ==
Historically, this status was derived from a town&#x27;s possession of a town charter, but town rights are now granted and regulated by statute. In the modern era, the status was first conferred on 24 February 1843, when seven of the eight towns that had previously been granted charters were reinstated as towns (Clervaux was not). They were (in the order given in the law): Luxembourg City, Diekirch, Grevenmacher, Echternach, Wiltz, Vianden, and Remich.

For over sixty years, no more towns were added, but the vast demographic shift during the last part of the nineteenth century made it impossible to leave the arrangements unchanged. Thus, on 29 May 1906, Esch-sur-Alzette was promoted; Esch was followed by Differdange, Dudelange, Ettelbruck, and Rumelange on 4 August 1907. An area of the (now extinct) commune of Hollerich was conferred the title on 7 April 1914, under the title of &#x27;Hollerich-Bonnevoie&#x27;; this status was lost when Hollerich was merged into Luxembourg City on 26 March 1920.

The last such statute affecting town status in Luxembourg was the &quot;Loi communale du 13 décembre 1988&quot;. In the order outlined in that legislation (i.e. alphabetical, except with Luxembourg City first), the twelve communes with town status are: Luxembourg City, Diekirch, Differdange, Dudelange, Echternach, Esch-sur-Alzette, Ettelbruck, Grevenmacher, Remich, Rumelange, Vianden, and Wiltz.

In spite of their town status, some of the municipalities are very small and more like villages than towns. There are also municipalities without town status that have more inhabitants than some of the official towns (especially in the Luxembourg and Red Lands agglomerations, but also elsewhere, such as Mersch). Apart from the capital, Luxembourg, which is a city with now over 110,000 inhabitants, only the three or five next largest municipalities (&quot;Esch-sur-Alzette, Differdange, Dudelange&quot;, plus possibly &quot;Ettelbruck&quot; and &quot;Diekirch&quot;) have long been urbanised enough to be described as towns. However, most municipalities are now growing with the continuously high figures of immigration to Luxembourg. There is a town planning project that aims at developing Ettelbruck, Diekirch and four bordering municipalities into a new centre called Nordstad (&quot;North Town&quot;) with an expected population of 30,000.

<doc id="467857" wikidata="Q997615" url="?curid=467857" title="Earl of Minto">
<text>Earl of Minto, in the County of Roxburgh, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1813 for Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Baron Minto. The current earl is Gilbert Timothy George Lariston Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 7th Earl of Minto (born 1953).

The family seat is Minto Park, near Hawick in the Scottish Borders. The original family seat, Minto Castle, was demolished in 1992 after having been abandoned for some time.

==History==
The family descends from the politician and judge Gilbert Elliot, who served as a Lord of Session under the judicial title of Lord Minto. In 1700 he was created a baronet, of Minto in the County of Roxburgh, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baronet. He was also a prominent judge and politician and served as a Lord of Session (under the judicial title of Lord Minto) from 1726 to 1733, as a Lord of the Justiciary from 1733 to 1765 and as Lord Justice Clerk from 1763 to 1766. His eldest son, the third Baronet, was a politician and held ministerial office as a Lord of the Admiralty from 1756 to 1762 and as Treasurer of the Navy from 1767 to 1770. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Baronet. He was a noted diplomat, politician and colonial administrator and served as Viceroy of the Anglo-Corsican Kingdom from 1794 to 1796 and Governor-General of India from 1807 to 1813. In 1797 he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Minto, of Minto in the County of Roxburgh. In 1813 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Melgund, of Melgund in the County of Forfar, and Earl of Minto, in the County of Roxburgh. The latter titles are in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In 1797 Lord Minto assumed by Royal licence the additional surnames of Murray-Kynynmound after those of Elliot.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He was a diplomat and Whig politician and held office as First Lord of the Admiralty from 1835 to 1841 and as Lord Privy Seal from 1846 to 1852. Lord Minto was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Earl. He sat as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Hythe, Greenock and Clackmannanshire. On his death the titles passed to his son, the fourth Earl. He was a prominent colonial administrator and served as Governor General of Canada from 1898 to 1904 and as Viceroy of India from 1905 to 1910. the titles are held by his great-grandson (the titles having descended from father to son), the seventh Earl, who succeeded in 2005.

The family seat is Minto, near Hawick, Roxburghshire. In 1992 Minto House was listed as Category A, and largely demolished within weeks.

<text>Aridisols (or desert soils) are a soil order in USDA soil taxonomy. Aridisols (from the Latin &quot;aridus&quot;, for &quot;dry&quot;, and &quot;solum&quot;) form in an arid or semi-arid climate. Aridisols dominate the deserts and xeric shrublands, which occupy about one-third of the Earth&#x27;s land surface. Aridisols have a very low concentration of organic matter, reflecting the paucity of vegetative production on these dry soils. 
Water deficiency is the central defining characteristic of Aridisols. Also required is sufficient age to exhibit subsoil weathering and development. Limited leaching in aridisols often results in one or more subsurface soil horizons in which suspended or dissolved minerals have been deposited: silicate clays, sodium, calcium carbonate, gypsum, or soluble salts. These subsoil horizons can also be cemented by carbonates, gypsum, or silica. Accumulation of salts on the surface can result in salinization.

In the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB), most Aridisols belong to the Calcisols, Gypsisols, Durisols and Solonchaks.

<text>Earl Cathcart is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

==History==
The title was created in 1814 for the soldier and diplomat William Cathcart, 1st Viscount Cathcart. The Cathcart family descends from Sir Alan Cathcart, who sometime between 1447 and 1460 was raised to the Peerage of Scotland as Lord Cathcart. He later served as Warden of the West Marches and Master of the Artillery. His great-great-grandson, the third Lord, was killed at the Battle of Pinkie in 1547 (his father Alan Cathcart, Master of Cathcart, was one of many Scottish noblemen killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513). He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Lord. He fought at the Battle of Langside in 1568 and was Master of the Household to King James VI. His great-great-great-grandson, the eighth Lord, was a soldier. He was a major-general in the army and sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer from 1734 to 1740. In 1740, Lord Cathcart was appointed commander-in-chief of the British Forces in America. However, he died on the passage out and was buried on Dominica.

He was succeeded by his son, the ninth Lord. He was a lieutenant-general in the army and also served as British Ambassador to Russia. Between 1752 and 1776, Lord Cathcart sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer. His son, the tenth Lord, was a noted military commander and diplomat. He was a general in the army and like his father served as British Ambassador to Russia. From 1788 to 1843, Lord Cathcart was a Scottish Representative Peer in the House of Lords. In 1807, he was created Baron Greenock, of Greenock in the County of Renfrew, and Viscount Cathcart, of Cathcart in the County of Renfrew, and in 1814 he was made Earl Cathcart. These titles were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

He was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, the second Earl. Like his father he was a general in the army and also served as Governor General of Canada from 1846 to 1847. On his death the titles passed to his second but eldest surviving son, the third Earl. He was a Deputy Lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire and President of the Royal Agricultural Society. His eldest son, the fourth Earl, was also a Deputy Lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire. He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Earl. His son, the sixth Earl, was a major-general in the army and served as a Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords from 1976 to 1989. The titles are held by the latter&#x27;s only son, the seventh Earl, who succeeded in 1999. He is one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sits on the Conservative benches. Lord Cathcart lost his seat in 1999 but was able to return in 2007 in a by-election caused by the death of Lord Mowbray. He is also chief of Clan Cathcart.

Several other members of the family may also be mentioned. The Hon. Sir George Cathcart, fourth son of the first Earl, was a general in the army. The Hon. Charles Cathcart, younger son of the ninth Lord, was a colonel in the British Army and represented Clackmannanshire in the House of Commons. The Hon. Louisa Cathcart, daughter of the ninth Lord, married David Murray, 7th Viscount of Stormont. In 1793, on the death of her and Lord Stormont&#x27;s uncle William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield and Mansfield, Louisa inherited (under a special remainder in the letters patent) the earldom of Mansfield created in 1776, and became the second Countess of Mansfield, while her husband inherited the earldom of Mansfield created in 1792, and became the second Earl of Mansfield (see the Earl of Mansfield and Mansfield for later history of these titles).

The family seat is Gateley Hall, near Fakenham, Norfolk.

<text>The Navy Cross is the United States Naval Service&#x27;s second-highest military decoration awarded for sailors and marines who distinguish themselves for extraordinary heroism in combat with an armed enemy force. The medal is equivalent to the Army&#x27;s Distinguished Service Cross, the Air and Space Forces&#x27; Air Force Cross, and the Coast Guard Cross.

The Navy Cross is bestowed by the Secretary of the Navy and may also be awarded to members of the other armed services, and to foreign military personnel while serving with the U.S. Naval Service. The Navy Cross was established by Act of Congress () and approved on February 4, 1919.

==History==
The Navy Cross was instituted in part due to the entrance of the United States into World War I. Many European nations had the custom of decorating heroes from other nations, but the Medal of Honor was the sole U.S. award for valor at the time. The Army instituted the Distinguished Service Cross and Distinguished Service Medal in 1918, while the Navy followed suit in 1919, retroactive to 6 April 1917. Originally, the Navy Cross was lower in precedence than the Medal of Honor and the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, because it was awarded for both combat heroism and for &quot;other distinguished service.&quot; Congress revised this on 7 August 1942, making the Navy Cross a combat-only decoration that follows the Medal of Honor in order of precedence. Since the medal was established, it has been awarded more than 6,300 times. It was designed by James Earle Fraser. Since the 11 September 2001 attacks the Navy Cross has been awarded 47 times, with two of them having the name of the recipient held in secret. One of those secret awardings was due to Marine Gunnery Sergeant Tate Jolly&#x27;s actions during the 2012 Benghazi attack.

==Criteria==

The Navy Cross may be awarded to any member of the U.S. Armed Forces while serving with the Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard (when a part of the Department of the Navy) who distinguishes themselves in action by extraordinary heroism not justifying an award of the Medal of Honor. The action must take place under one of three circumstances:
# In combat action while engaged against an enemy of the United States; or,
# In combat action while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force; or, 
# In combat action while serving with friendly foreign forces, who are engaged in armed conflict in which the United States is not a belligerent party.

The act(s) to be commended must be performed in the presence of great danger, or at great personal risk, and must be performed in such a manner as to render the individual&#x27;s action(s) highly conspicuous among others of equal grade, rate, experience, or position of responsibility. An accumulation of minor acts of heroism does not justify an award of the Navy Cross.

As originally authorized, the Navy Cross could be awarded for distinguished non-combat acts, but legislation of 7 August 1942 limited the award to acts of combat heroism. Past Navy Cross awards for merit, such as to 9th Chief of Naval Operations Fleet Admiral Ernest King, were unaffected by the change in criteria.

==Wear==
The Navy Cross originally was the Navy&#x27;s third-highest decoration, after the Medal of Honor and the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. On 7 August 1942, Congress revised the order of precedence, placing the Navy Cross above the Distinguished Service Medal in precedence. Since that time, the Navy Cross has been worn after the Medal of Honor and before all other awards.

Additional awards of the Navy Cross are denoted by gold or silver inch stars affixed to the suspension and service ribbon of the medal. A gold star would be issued for each of the second through fifth awards, to be replaced by a silver star which would indicate a sixth award. To date no one has received more than five awards.

==Description and symbolism==
; Medal
Obverse:
The medal is a modified cross pattée one and a half inches wide. The ends of its arms are rounded whereas a conventional cross patée has arms that are straight on the end. There are four laurel leaves with berries in each of the re-entrant arms of the cross. In the center of the cross, a sailing vessel is depicted on waves, sailing to the viewer&#x27;s left. The vessel is a symbolic caravel of the type used between 1480 and 1500. Fraser selected the caravel because it was a symbol often used by the Naval Academy and because it represented both naval service and the tradition of the sea. The laurel leaves with berries refer to achievement.

Reverse:
In the center of the medal, a bronze cross pattée, one and a half inches wide, are crossed anchors from the pre-1850 period, with cables attached. The letters USN are evident amid the anchors.

The earliest version of the Navy Cross (1919–1928) featured a more narrow strip of white, while the so-called &quot;Black Widow&quot; medals awarded from 1941 to 1942 were notable for the dark color due to over-anodized finish. The medal is similar in appearance to the British Distinguished Service Cross.

; Service Ribbon
The service ribbon is navy blue with a center stripe of white identical to the suspension ribbon of the medal. The blue alludes to naval service; the white represents the purity of selflessness.

<text>A landmass, or land mass, is a large region or area of land that is in one piece and not noticeably broken up by oceans. The term is often used to refer to lands surrounded by an ocean or sea, such as a continent or a large island. In the field of geology, a landmass is a defined section of continental crust extending above sea level.

Continents are often thought of as distinct landmasses and may include any islands that are part of the associated continental shelf. When multiple continents form a single contiguous land connection, the connected continents may be viewed as a single landmass. Earth&#x27;s largest landmasses are (starting with largest):

# Afro-Eurasia (main landmass of the geoscheme region of the same name and its continental parts Africa and Eurasia - or Europe and Asia; the center of Earth&#x27;s land hemisphere, comprising more than half of Earth&#x27;s landmass)
# Americas (main landmass of the geo-region of the same name and its continental parts North and South America; comprising most of the landmass of the Western Hemisphere)
# Antarctica (main landmass of the geo-region and continent of the same name)
# Mainland Australia (main landmass of the geo-region Oceania, its sub-region Australasia, the continent Australia and the country Australia)

<text>Runrig were a Scottish Celtic rock band formed on the Isle of Skye in 1973. From its inception, the band&#x27;s line-up included brothers and songwriters Rory MacDonald (bass, vocals) and Calum MacDonald (percussion). The line-up during most of the 1980s and 1990s, which was the band&#x27;s most successful period commercially, also included Donnie Munro (vocals), Malcolm Jones (guitar), Iain Bayne (drums), and Pete Wishart (keyboards). 

At the height of their success during the 1980s and 1990s, Runrig were described by &quot;Billboard&quot; as one of the &quot;most celebrated&quot; Gaelic language bands in Scotland. Their 1995 single &quot;An Ubhal as Àirde (The Highest Apple)&quot; made history by becoming the first song to be sung in Scottish Gaelic to chart on the UK Singles Charts. In 2007, they re–released their 1983 debut single &quot;Loch Lomond&quot; with the Tartan Army, entitled &quot;Loch Lomond (Hampden Remix)&quot;. It debuted at number one in their native Scotland, remaining on the top spot for four weeks, and in the United Kingdom, debuted at number nine, earning a Silver certification from the BPI.

In 2016, the band announced their retirement from recording and performing following the release of &quot;The Story&quot;, (2016) and announced their final tour &quot;The Final Mile&quot; in 2017. In August 2018, Runrig performed the final shows of their farewell tour, entitled &quot;The Last Dance&quot;, in Stirling City Park beneath the castle ramparts. An estimated 52,000 fans attended &quot;The Last Dance&quot;. 

== History ==
=== Formation and early years (1973–1987) === 
Initially formed as a three-piece dance band known as &#x27;The Run Rig Dance Band&#x27;, the band played several low key events, and has previously cited a ceilidh at Kelvin Hall, Glasgow as their first concert. The band was formed in 1973 with brothers Calum and Rory Macdonald and their friend Blair Douglas. Donnie Munro joined the following year and they started to expand outside their native Isle of Skye. Douglas left the band in late 1974 and was replaced by Robert Macdonald. This line-up continued until 1978, when Douglas re-joined and Malcolm Jones became guitarist, both displacing Robert Macdonald. In the same year, Runrig&#x27;s first album, entitled &quot;Play Gaelic&quot;, was released. All the songs were in Gaelic. It was re-released in 1990 as &quot;Play Gaelic, the first legendary recording&quot;. In 1979, Blair Douglas left Runrig again to pursue a solo career. 1979 also saw the release of Runrig&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Highland Connection&quot; on the band&#x27;s own label, Ridge Records. A somewhat transitional album, it features wailing electric guitars and ballads. The album also included the original version of &quot;Loch Lomond&quot;. A later version was to become their signature song and closing song at concerts.

The third Runrig album, &quot;Recovery&quot; (released in 1981), was a thematic record dealing with the rise and politics of Scotland&#x27;s Gaelic community. 1980 saw the arrival of drummer Iain Bayne (from Scottish folk/rock band New Celeste) and keyboard player Richard Cherns. In 1982, Runrig re-recorded &quot;Loch Lomond&quot; as their first single. They signed to a small label called Simple Records in 1984, and two singles were released. The first was &quot;Dance Called America&quot;. A longer version of the second single &quot;Skye&quot; appeared on the Alba Records compilation &quot;A Feast Of Scottish Folk Music, Volume One&quot; along with an early version of &quot;Lifeline&quot;, both of which were previously unreleased on albums, and &quot;Na h-Uain a&#x27;s t-Earrach&quot; which was the B-side to &quot;Dance Called America&quot;.

The band then engaged the services of producer Chris Harley who brought to their recordings the benefit of his experience as a solo artist and a singer with The Alan Parsons Project and Camel. Runrig&#x27;s fourth independent studio album, &quot;&quot;Heartland&quot;&quot; (released in 1985), combined Gaelic sounds with anthemic rock music. Richard Cherns left the band in February 1986 and was replaced by ex-Big Country member Pete Wishart.

=== Mainstream success and challenges (1987–2001) ===
The period from 1987 to 1997 marked Runrig&#x27;s most successful run, during which they achieved placings in both the UK albums and singles charts, and toured extensively. With, for the first time, major-label support which was provided by Chrysalis, Runrig&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;The Cutter and the Clan&quot; (1987), which had originally been released on the independent Ridge Records label before being re-released on Chrysalis, brought the band wider audiences in the United Kingdom, as well as in other parts of Europe. From 1987 to 1995, Runrig released a total of five studio albums through Chrysalis Records. Along with &quot;The Cutter and the Clan&quot;, the four albums released by the band under Chrysalis Records include &quot;Searchlight&quot; (1989), &quot;The Big Wheel&quot; (1991), &quot;Amazing Things&quot; (1993), and &quot;Mara&quot; (1995).

On 22 June 1991, the band attracted around 50,000 people to an outdoor concert held in Balloch Country Park, near Loch Lomond. This was the largest number of people to attend a Runrig concert. Following the release of &quot;Mara&quot;, lead singer Donnie Munro grew more involved in politics. In 1997, he left Runrig to stand for a seat in the House of Commons for the Labour Party. However, he was not elected.

Runrig began searching for a new frontman, and in 1998 they announced their selection of Bruce Guthro, a singer-songwriter from Nova Scotia. Runrig&#x27;s tenth album, &quot;In Search Of Angels&quot; (1999), was released amidst some uncertainty about the band&#x27;s future. Since their contract with Chrysalis had ended, Runrig chose to release &quot;In Search Of Angels&quot; on their own label, Ridge Records. As a result, the record received much less promotion than the previous five, and sales were considerably smaller. Runrig was also faced with the challenge of acclimatising their fans to a new lead vocalist. The band toured extensively in support of the record, and in 2000, they released a live album entitled &quot;Live at Celtic Connections 2000&quot;, allowing fans to hear songs previously sung by Donnie Munro by their new frontman, Bruce Guthro. At the end of 2000, the band released of an authorised songbook entitled &quot;Flower of the West – The Runrig Songbook&quot; which included lyrics, sheet music, photographs, and background information for 115 of Runrig&#x27;s songs – nearly every album track and single from the band&#x27;s first ten studio albums.

===Renewed popularity (2001–2009)=== 
Having established that they could continue without Donnie Munro, Runrig set to work on their eleventh studio album. Among their independently-released studio albums, &quot;The Stamping Ground&quot; (2001) was Runrig&#x27;s most successful. Moreover, critics who had given mixed reviews to &quot;In Search Of Angels&quot;, praised &quot;The Stamping Ground&quot; as the quintessential Runrig album. The band continued to enjoy support in the UK, Germany, and Denmark. However, with a Canadian frontman, Runrig began finding new fans in Canada and the United States. In 2001, Pete Wishart, the band&#x27;s keyboard player, left after being elected Member of Parliament for the constituency of Tayside North for the Scottish National Party. In the 2005 election he was again elected, this time for the new constituency of Perth and North Perthshire and again for the SNP. Brian Hurren stepped in to take Wishart&#x27;s place in the band. Wishart has been re-elected in each subsequent general election. The 2001 album &quot;The Stamping Ground&quot; was seen very much as a return to form after the lacklustre &quot;In Search Of Angels&quot; (1999), but 2003&#x27;s &quot;Proterra&quot; divided opinion amongst music journalists and public alike.

In August 2003, Runrig played their 30th Anniversary concert on the esplanade at Stirling Castle, celebrating 30 years since the band&#x27;s formation, and including visitors from previous line-ups, as well as guest artists including the Glasgow Islay Choir and Paul Mounsey. Runrig played their first U.S. concert, a benefit for the charity &quot;Glasgow the Caring City&quot;, on 4 April 2006 at the Nokia Theatre in New York City. Founding member Blair Douglas joined the band onstage, playing accordion on several numbers. While the bulk of their 2007 tour was scheduled for Denmark, Germany, and England, an outdoor show, titled &quot;Beat The Drum&quot;, was held at Loch Ness on 18 August 2007. It was staged at Borlum Farm, Drumnadrochit and attended by 18,500 people in heavy rain. Because of the unusually large number of support acts, it had been likened to an all-day music festival, Runrig being the headline act. This was the first in what was to become a staple for Runrig – annually staging big outdoor shows in Scotland in summer.

Runrig re-recorded &quot;Loch Lomond&quot; and release it as &quot;Loch Lomond (Hampden Remix)&quot; to raise funds for the BBC&#x27;s annual Children in Need appeal. The song was released on 12 November 2007, and includes the &quot;Tartan Army&quot;, the name used to refer to supports of the Scotland national football team, and including Rod Stewart, on backing vocals. It reached No. 9 in the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Loch Lomond (Hampden Remix)&quot; was named &quot;The Best Scottish Song Of All Time&quot; in November 2008. The band were presented the award by Lulu. On 5 December 2008, during the penultimate tour date at The Barrowlands, Glasgow, the band was inducted into the Scottish Traditional Music Hall Of Fame, by the Scottish Traditional Music Awards Director.

On 29 August 2009, Runrig performed at Scone Palace for their third annual outdoor summer show (the second being at Edinburgh Castle in 2008). They were supported by acts such as the Peatbog Faeries, piper Fred Morrison, King Creosote, Kathleen Macinnes, and Blair Douglas (a former member of the group) and his band. The show was part of Scotland&#x27;s Year of Homecoming 2009. To underline this, First Minister Alex Salmond made an appearance on stage (introduced by his SNP colleague and former band member Pete Wishart), and launched an initiative called &#x27;SconeStone.&#x27; This aims to promote Scotland as a kind and compassionate nation through the &quot;journey of kindness&quot; made by the SconeStone across the world. Its keepers, each holding it for a week before passing it on, are expected to undertake a good deed. Its first keeper was the Reverend Neil Galbraith, who was presented with the stone on the same day.

=== &quot;50 Great Songs&quot; and break (2009–2012) ===
In March 2009, guitarist Malcolm Jones suffered a heart attack in Edinburgh whilst running to catch a train. This forced the band to cancel a sizable tour of Austria, Switzerland, Denmark and Germany. After undergoing minor surgery, he took to the stage with Runrig again in May of the same year. During a routine check up with his doctors in June 2009, he was strongly advised to have heart bypass surgery, which forced the band to cancel a tour of Denmark. 

The operation was a success and, although the band was forced to cancel their show at the 35th Tønder Festival in Tønder, Denmark, Malcolm returned to the stage in late August 2009, at the band&#x27;s big outdoor Scottish Homecoming show for 2009 at Scone Palace, Perthshire, Scotland. However, on 28 February 2010, just a week prior to an extensive German tour, it was announced that Malcolm would have to have yet another operation which in turn forced the band to cancel/postpone their Spring dates in Germany, due to start on 3 March 2010. In a statement released by the band on their official website they noted that Malcolm&#x27;s health was &quot;good&quot; and that the problem was &quot;purely a technical one&quot;. They also emphatically stated that &quot;All other concerts planned for 2010 will go ahead.&quot;

It was announced that the winter tour scheduled for winter 2010 would be the last tour for a year with the band planning no concerts in 2011 so that they could focus on other projects. The final date for 2010 was in the Barrowland Ballroom, Glasgow which is traditionally where the band finishes their Scottish tours. In a statement released by the office, they promised it to be &quot;quite a party&quot;. On 1 November 2010, the band released a four-disc compilation, entitled &quot;50 Great Songs&quot;. The release includes both studio and live performances, focusing primarily upon Bruce Guthro&#x27;s time within the band.

After the end of the 2010 tour the band collectively made the decision to take a year off. Calum and Rory had been concentrating on a long-gestating project outside of Runrig. The duo call themselves The Band from Rockall and released their debut album outside of Runrig at the end of April 2012. Keyboardist Brian Hurren also released his debut solo album, which he wrote, performed and produced himself, under the name &quot;A Hundred Thousand Welcomes&quot;, the inspiration for the name coming from Bruce Guthro shouting the Gaelic equivalent of the phrase during &quot;Beat the Drum&quot; at Loch Ness. Guthro released another solo album, while drummer Iain Bayne was appointed manager of English folk-rock band Coast. The band re-united as a six-piece again in the summer of 2012 for the Rewired Tour, with the big Scottish outdoor show held in August at the Northern Meeting Park in Inverness.

=== 40th anniversary and &quot;The Story&quot; (2013–2017) ===

In November 2012, ahead of their planned Rewired Tour, the band announced a special 40th Anniversary Concert at the Black Isle Show Ground in Muir of Ord, near Inverness. The 40th Anniversary show was a weekend of live entertainment featuring &#x27;special guests&#x27;, entitled &quot;Party on the Moor&quot;. Shortly after that they announced another &quot;special&quot; concert at Edinburgh Castle in July, entitled &quot;Celebration in the City&quot;. On 28 April 2013 (to mark Runrig&#x27;s first ever concert 40 years earlier) Runrig released their first single in 5 years entitled &quot;And We&#x27;ll Sing&quot;. 
At Party on the Moor former members Donnie Munro and Pete Wishart performed onstage alongside the current lineup and Blair Douglas made an appearance via a short video highlighting the changes in the band&#x27;s lineup since 1973. This was the first time Munro had performed with Runrig since 1997, and for many it was a powerful statement seeing Guthro and Munro singing together as there had been heated debates about who should be the band&#x27;s frontman, and who was the better frontman among many fans and critics. The gig was hailed as a success by fans and critics many calling it one of the best concerts Runrig have ever staged. Bassist, Rory Macdonald said that &quot;in many ways, it was the perfect Runrig gig&quot; whilst drummer, Iain Bayne called it &quot;the culmination of a lifetime&#x27;s work&quot;.

In late 2013 it was announced that Runrig would embark on a Spring 2014 tour of England to continue the 40th Anniversary celebrations. Entitled &quot;Party on the Tour&quot; it would &quot;draw inspiration&quot; from the Party on the Moor show. Alongside the English dates, several European music festivals were announced for 2014. In December 2013 it was officially confirmed that Party on the Moor would be released on DVD. In January further details for the DVD were released. On 31 March 2014 Runrig released the full, uncut concert on both DVD, CD and, for the first time ever for Runrig, Blu-ray. The band announced in issue 74 of The Wire magazine and on their official Twitter feed that they had begun work on their 14th studio album. It was also announced (informally) that to accommodate for the time it takes to write, record and produce an album they would not be playing any further live shows in 2014 after the Tønder Festival, due to be held on 28 and 29 August 2014. In the summer 2015 issue of The Wire it was revealed that the album would be called &quot;The Story&quot;, and would be released in spring 2016.

On 12 November 2015 the title track, and lead single, received its first radio play on BBC Radio nan Gàidheal. During an interview with the show&#x27;s host Derek Murray, Calum Macdonald said that the upcoming album would likely be the last studio album that the band would release, also confirming the album&#x27;s release date as 29 January 2016. On 13 November 2015, the single was released in both CD and digital download form accompanied by a music video. Shortly after the single was released, the band announced that along with a sizeable tour of the UK and Europe in 2016 they would both be headlining the 21st HebCelt Festival on the Isle of Lewis and staging an outdoor show at Edinburgh Castle in July 2016.

===&quot;The Last Dance&quot; and disbandment (2017–2018)===

On 26 September 2017, Runrig announced that after forty-five years they would be &quot;pulling the curtain down&quot; on both recording and performing. Following the announcement, the band announced a final concert tour entitled &quot;The Final Mile&quot; which would include dates in Germany, Denmark and the United Kingdom. The tour concluded with a final show in Stirling&#x27;s City Park entitled &quot;The Last Dance&quot; which took place over two days and was attended by over 50,000 people over the course of the two dates. During the tour, all members of Runrig were given the opportunity to be &quot;front and centre&quot; for a period of time during the setlist, from a drum set which included Iain Bayne and Calum MacDonald and keyboardist Brian Hurren who performed vocals during &quot;In Search of Angels&quot;. 

Original lead singer of the band, Donnie Munro, who left in 1997 to pursue a career in politics, joined the band to perform &quot;Cearcal a’ Chuain&quot; and &quot;Cum ‘Ur n’Aire&quot; alongside the Glasgow Islay Gaelic Choir. To conclude the concert, Macdonald thanked fans for &quot;45 years of memories you’ve given to us&quot; and vowed that whilst the band &quot;will not perform on stage as Runrig again, the music lives on&quot;.

===Post–breakup (2018–present)===

In September 2018, one month following their final performance in Stirling during &quot;The Last Dance&quot;, Sony Music released a box set compilation entitled &quot;Original Album Classics&quot;. In August 2019, the band announced the release of the concert on audio and film formats entitled &quot;The Last Dance – Farewell Concert&quot;. In 2021, BBC Alba broadcast &quot;The Last Dance&quot; from Stirling in April, marking the first time the performance had been broadcast on television, alongside other programmes devoted to the band over the course of the weekend spanning 2–4 April 2021.

Bruce Guthro, who joined the band in 1998 following the departure of original lead singer Donnie Munro, died on 5 September 2023 from cancer.

==Artistry==

Runrig&#x27;s music is often described as a blend of folk and rock music, with the band&#x27;s lyrics often focusing upon locations, history, politics, and people that are unique to Scotland. Songs also make references to agriculture, land conservation and religion. Many of the band&#x27;s songs include references to Scottish history or culture. These include the band&#x27;s name itself – which is a reference to a pre–agricultural revolution farming practice, run rig.

<text>Jaromír, Jaromir, Jaroměr is a Slavic male given name.

==Origin and meaning==
Jaromír is a West Slavic given name composed of two stems &quot;jaro&quot; and &quot;mír&quot;.
The meaning is not definite:
*Polish &quot;jary&quot; (archaic) = „spry, young, strong“; &quot;mir&quot; = „prestige, good reputation“
*Upper Sorbian &quot;jara&quot; = „very“; &quot;měr&quot; = „peace“
*old-Ruthenian &quot;jaro&quot; = „sun“; &quot;mir&quot; = „peace, world“

== False etymology ==
In the Czech, the name is seemingly composed from two other words. Word &quot;Jaro&quot; means „spring“ and word &quot;mír&quot; means „peace“.

==Variations==

* Jaromír (Czech, Slovak)

The female forms are Jaromira or Jaromíra. The short form is Jesko.

<text>A ricochet ( ; ) is a rebound, bounce, or skip off a surface, particularly in the case of a projectile. Most ricochets are caused by accident and while the force of the deflection decelerates the projectile, it can still be energetic and almost as dangerous as before the deflection. The possibility of ricochet is one of the reasons for the common firearms safety rule &quot;Never shoot a bullet at a flat, hard surface.&quot; Ricochets can occur with &quot;any&quot; caliber, but short or round ricocheting bullets may not produce the audible whine caused by tumbling irregular shapes. Ricochets are a hazard of shooting because, for as long as they retain sufficient velocity, ricocheting bullets or bullet fragments may cause collateral damage to animals, objects, or even the person who fired the shot.

==Variables==
Ricochets occur when a bullet or bullet fragment is deflected by an object rather than penetrating and becoming embedded in that object. Ricochet behavior may vary with bullet shape, bullet material, spin, velocity (and distance), target material and the angle of incidence.
===Velocity===
High-velocity rifle cartridges have higher probability of bullet penetration, because increased energy released by an identical bullet may fracture or temporarily melt the target at the point of impact. Alternatively, the same energy release may melt and/or disintegrate the bullet to reduce size and range of deflected particles. Ricochets are more likely with handgun cartridges and low velocity rifle cartridges such as .22 long rifle. Buckshot and shotgun slugs have similarly high ricochet probability, but ricochet range of smaller shot is lower than intact rifle or handgun bullet ricochets.

===Bullet===
Sectional density, or mass of the bullet divided by the frontal area of the bullet, increases penetration of resistant surfaces. Elongated, spin-stabilized bullets fired from rifled firearms have greater sectional density than spherical bullets of the same diameter made from the same material; and elongated rifle cartridge bullets have greater sectional density than short bullets of the same diameter handgun cartridges. Bullet velocity is reduced by as much as 35% by each ricochet deflection, and velocity is further reduced by air resistance as cohesive bullet fragments often produce an audible whine tumbling after losing stability.

===Target material===
Comparative hardness and density determine the results of collisions with bullets. Bullets tend to penetrate low density materials like air with little deflection, although friction causes rotated projectiles to drift in the direction of rifling twist as the bullet falls through the atmosphere under the influence of gravity. Ricochets may be similarly deflected in the direction of rotation of the side of a spin-stabilized bullet contacting a resistant surface. Dense objects tend to prevail in collisions with less dense objects; so dense bullets tend to penetrate less dense materials, and dense materials tend to deflect light bullets. Resistance to penetration can be evaluated as the sectional density of the target material along the axis of bullet movement in front of the bullet. Metallic foil will be more easily penetrated than metal ingots, and sectional density of sheet metal increases as orientation of the sheet diverges from perpendicular to, toward parallel with, the bullet path. Bullets are more likely to ricochet off flat, hard surfaces such as concrete, rock or steel, but a ricochet can occur from irregular surfaces within heterogeneous materials including soil and vegetation. Uniformly soft, flexible materials like sand have a lower incidence of ricochet. Though it may not be intuitive, bullets easily ricochet off water; compare stone skipping.

===Angle===
The angle of departure, both vertically and horizontally, is difficult to calculate or predict due to the many variables involved, not the least of which is the deformation of the bullet caused by its impact with the surface it strikes. Probability of ricochet is highest from surfaces approximately parallel to the axis of bullet movement, and grazing ricochets typically depart the surface at a smaller angle than the angle of incidence (or approach). Probability of bullet penetration increases as the axis of bullet movement becomes perpendicular to the target surface; but penetration may create a depression or crater within which the bullet may ricochet more than once, possibly following the arc of the crater floor to depart the crater at a greater angle from the original surface than the angle of incidence. In an extreme case, a strong, cohesive bullet striking a nearly perpendicular elastic surface may ricochet directly back at the shooter. This situation is sometimes observed when hardened armor-piercing bullet cores fail to completely penetrate steel plate. The United States Army noted increased ricochet range after adopting the M855A1 green bullet with a larger steel core than the M855 bullet it replaced. Buckshot and subsonic bullets may be similarly reflected from rubber vehicle tires.

==Consequences==

Not all ricochets are accidental. Some bullets are fired to intentionally ricochet, just as in ricochets of some ball games like basketball and pool. Bullet traps at indoor shooting ranges often include durable steel plates to deflect bullets downward into a material intended to stop and capture the bullets. Cannonballs were often fired to strike the ground or water in front of their target in anticipation of ricochets which would keep the projectile at an effective distance above the ground or water surface through massed troops or ships.

The behavior of iron cannonballs documented during the era of muzzle-loading cannon may be a useful approximation for a BB gun or steel pellets fired from a shotgun, but inelastic collisions between the various shapes and materials of high-velocity bullets and the objects they may strike make bullet ricochets less predictable than the intuitive symmetry of low-velocity game spheres.

The problem with unintentional ricochets is potential damage caused to objects outside the intended path of the bullet. A responsible shooter anticipates potential bullet interactions within a cone of space around the aim point. The shooter is at the apex of the cone, and the cone is symmetrical around the intended bullet path. The angle of that cone may initially be defined by the accuracy of the firearm and the skill of the shooter; but any ricochet potential within the cone becomes the apex of a ricochet cone with a broader angle. The ground surface is a frequent source of ricochets. A bullet may be deflected more than once before it comes to rest.

Damage potential of ricochets, like bullets, is proportional to the mass of the bullet fragment and the square of its velocity. Ricochet velocity is always lower than collision velocity, but may be close to collision velocity for small angles of deflection. Ricochet mass may be similarly close to original bullet mass for full metal jacket bullets or green bullets replacing soft lead with solid copper or a steel core. Frangible bullets or lead core varmint hunting bullets are more susceptible to collision damage, and produce smaller ricochet fragments. Lower initial mass gives small fragment ricochets less damage potential, and distance of travel is reduced by more rapid loss of velocity from air resistance. Reduced ricochet range is one of the reasons the newer .17 HMR round with its frangible bullet has gained popularity against the older non-fragmenting .22 WMR.

Ricochets can be lethal. A notable death caused by ricochet was the hostage Katrina Dawson during the Lindt cafe siege in December 2014, killed by a ricochet from a police bullet when tactical officers stormed the building.

<text>Inspection in software engineering, refers to peer review of any work product by trained individuals who look for defects using a well defined process. An inspection might also be referred to as a Fagan inspection after Michael Fagan, the creator of a very popular software inspection process.

==Introduction==

An inspection is one of the most common sorts of review practices found in software projects. The goal of the inspection is to identify defects. Commonly inspected work products include software requirements specifications and test plans. In an inspection, a work product is selected for review and a team is gathered for an inspection meeting to review the work product. A moderator is chosen to moderate the meeting. Each inspector prepares for the meeting by reading the work product and noting each defect. In an inspection, a defect is any part of the work product that will keep an inspector from approving it. For example, if the team is inspecting a software requirements specification, each defect will be text in the document which an inspector disagrees with.

==Inspection process==

The inspection process was developed in the mid-1970s and it has later been extended and modified.

The process should have entry criteria that determine if the inspection process is ready to begin. This prevents unfinished work products from entering the inspection process. The entry criteria might be a checklist including items such as &quot;The document has been spell-checked&quot;.

The stages in the inspections process are: Planning, Overview meeting, Preparation, Inspection meeting, Rework and Follow-up. The Preparation, Inspection meeting and Rework stages might be iterated.

* Planning: The inspection is planned by the moderator.
* Overview meeting: The author describes the background of the work product.
* Preparation: Each inspector examines the work product to identify possible defects.
* Inspection meeting: During this meeting the reader reads through the work product, part by part and the inspectors point out the defects for every part.
* Rework: The author makes changes to the work product according to the action plans from the inspection meeting.
* Follow-up: The changes by the author are checked to make sure everything is correct.

The process is ended by the moderator when it satisfies some predefined exit criteria.
The term inspection refers to one of the most important elements of the entire process that surrounds the execution and successful completion of a software engineering project.

==Inspection roles==
During an inspection the following roles are used.

* Author: The person who created the work product being inspected.
* Moderator: This is the leader of the inspection. The moderator plans the inspection and coordinates it.
* Reader: The person reading through the documents, one item at a time. The other inspectors then point out defects.
* Recorder/Scribe: The person that documents the defects that are found during the inspection.
* Inspector: The person that examines the work product to identify possible defects.

==Related inspection types==

===Code review===

A code review can be done as a special kind of inspection in which the team examines a sample of code and fixes any defects in it. In a code review, a defect is a block of code which does not properly implement its requirements, which does not function as the programmer intended, or which is not incorrect but could be improved (for example, it could be made more readable or its performance could be improved). In addition to helping teams find and fix bugs, code reviews are useful both for cross-training programmers on the code being reviewed and for helping junior developers learn new programming techniques.

===Peer reviews===
Peer reviews are considered an industry best-practice for detecting software defects early and learning about software artifacts. Peer Reviews are composed of software walkthroughs and software inspections and are integral to software product engineering activities. A collection of coordinated knowledge, skills, and behaviors facilitates the best possible practice of Peer Reviews. The elements of Peer Reviews include the structured review process, standard of excellence product checklists, defined roles of participants, and the forms and reports.

Software inspections are the most rigorous form of Peer Reviews and fully utilize these elements in detecting defects. Software walkthroughs draw selectively upon the elements in assisting the producer to obtain the deepest understanding of an artifact and reaching a consensus among participants. Measured results reveal that Peer Reviews produce an attractive return on investment obtained through accelerated learning and early defect detection. For best results, Peer Reviews are rolled out within an organization through a defined program of preparing a policy and procedure, training practitioners and managers, defining measurements and populating a database structure, and sustaining the roll out infrastructure.

<text>An inspection is, most generally, an organized examination or formal evaluation exercise. In engineering activities inspection involves the measurements, tests, and gauges applied to certain characteristics in regard to an object or activity. The results are usually compared to specified requirements and standards for determining whether the item or activity is in line with these targets, often with a Standard Inspection Procedure in place to ensure consistent checking. Inspections are usually non-destructive.

Inspections may be a visual inspection or involve sensing technologies such as ultrasonic testing, accomplished with a direct physical presence or remotely such as a remote visual inspection, and manually or automatically such as an automated optical inspection. Non-contact optical measurement and photogrammetry have become common NDT methods for inspection of manufactured components and design optimisation.

A 2007 Scottish Government review of scrutiny of public services (the Crerar Review) defined inspection of public services as &quot;... periodic, targeted scrutiny of specific services, to check whether they are meeting national and local performance standards, legislative and professional requirements, and the needs of service users.&quot;

A surprise inspection tends to have different results than an announced inspection. Leaders wanting to know how others in their organization perform can drop in without warning, to see directly what happens. If an inspection is made known in advance, it can give people a chance to cover up or to fix mistakes, which could lead to distorted and inaccurate findings. A surprise inspection, therefore, gives inspectors a better picture of the typical state of the inspected object or process than an announced inspection. It also enhances external confidence in the inspection process.

==Specific inspection==

=== Manufacturing ===
Quality related in-process inspection/verification is an essential part of quality control in manufacturing.
This includes measuring, examining, testing, or gauging one or more characteristics of a product or process and comparing the results with specified requirements to determine whether is the requirements are met for each characteristic. Common examples of inspection by measurement or gauging include using a caliper or micrometer to determine if a dimension of a manufactured part is within the dimensional tolerance specified in a drawing for that part, and is thus acceptable for use.

Design for inspection (DFI) is a concept that should complement and work in collaboration with design for manufacturability (DFM) and design for assembly (DMA) to reduce product manufacturing cost and increase manufacturing practicality.

Photogrammetry is a modern way of visual inspection, delivering high accuracy and traceability for various industries. The portable 3D system is a versatile optical coordinate measuring machine (CMM) with a wide range of capabilities. Highly accurate point measurements can be taken with inspection carried out directly to CAD models, geometry or drawings.(DFI)

===Fire equipment===
Most fire equipment needs to be inspected to make sure in the event of a fire, every effort has been taken to make sure it does not get out of control. Extinguishers are to be inspected every month by law and inspected by a servicing company at least once a year. Fire extinguishers can be heavy, so it&#x27;s a good idea to practice picking up and holding an extinguisher to get an idea of the weight and feel.

===Business===
In international trade several destination countries require pre-shipment inspection. The importer instructs the shipper which inspection company should be used. The inspector makes pictures and a report to certify that the goods that are being shipped and produced are in accordance with the accompanying documents.

Commodity inspection is other term that is used between buyers and sellers. The scope of work for commodity inspection depends to the buyers. Some buyers hire the inspection agencies only for pre-shipment inspections i.e. visual quality, quantity, packing, marking and loading inspections and some others request for higher level inspections and ask inspection agencies to attend in the vendor shops and inspect commodities during manufacturing processes. Normally inspection is done based on an agreed inspection and test plan (ITP).

===Government===
In government and politics, an &quot;inspection&quot; is the act of a monitoring authority administering an official review of various criteria (such as documents, facilities, records, and any other assets) that are deemed by the authority to be related to the inspection. Inspections are used for the purpose of determining if a body is complying with regulations. The inspector examines the criteria and talks with involved individuals. A report and evaluation follows such visits.

In the United States, the Food Safety Inspection Service is charged with ensuring that all meat and egg products are safe to consume and accurately labeled. The Meat Inspection Act of 1906 authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to order meat inspections and condemn any found unfit for human consumption.

The United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission is a regulatory body that inspects for weapons of mass destruction.

The Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care regulates and inspects care services in Scotland.

A labour inspectorate is a government body that executes checks on compliance to the labour law. It performs inspections on the workplace or building site.

===Road vehicles===
A vehicle inspection, e.g., an annual inspection, is a necessary inspection required on vehicles to conform with laws regarding safety, emissions, or both. It consists of an examination of a vehicle&#x27;s components, usually done by a certified mechanic. Vehicles pass a pre-warranty inspection, if, and only if, a mechanic provide evidence for the proper working condition of the vehicle systems specified in the type of inspection.

===Engineering, mechanics===

A mechanical inspection is usually undertaken to ensure the safety or reliability of structures or machinery.

In Europe bodies involved in engineering inspection may be assessed by accreditation bodies according to ISO 17020 &quot;General criteria for the operation of various types of bodies performing inspection&quot;. This standard defines inspection as &quot;examination of a product, process, service, or installation or their design and determination of its conformity with specific requirements or, on the basis of professional judgment, with general requirements&quot;.

Non-destructive examination (NDE) or nondestructive testing (NDT) is a family of technologies used during inspection to analyze materials, components and products for either inherent defects (such as fractures or cracks), or service induced defects (damage from use). Some common methods are visual, industrial computed tomography scanning, microscopy, dye penetrant inspection, magnetic-particle inspection, X-ray or radiographic testing, ultrasonic testing, eddy-current testing, acoustic emission testing, and thermographic inspection. In addition, many non-destructive inspections can be performed by a precision scale, or when in motion, a checkweigher. Stereo microscopes are often used for examining small products like circuit boards for product defects.

Pipeline inspection is a crucial process in ensuring the integrity and safety of pipelines used in various industries such as oil and gas, fertilizer, process industries, food and beverages, water distribution, and transportation. This systematic examination involves the assessment of pipeline materials, structural integrity, corrosion levels, and potential defects using advanced technologies like ultrasonic testing, magnetic flux leakage, and visual inspections. Regular inspections help identify issues early, allowing for timely maintenance and reducing the risk of leaks or catastrophic failures, thus ensuring the efficient and safe operation of these vital infrastructure components.

Inspection and technical assistance during turnarounds helps to decrease costly downtime as well as ensures restart of operations quickly and safely.

===Medical===
A medical inspection is the thorough and unhurried visualization of a patient, this requires the use of the naked eye.

===Military===
An examination vessel is a craft used to inspect ships entering or leaving a port during wartime.

===Railroad===
The railroad&#x27;s inspection locomotive were special types of steam locomotives designed to carry railroad officials on inspection tours of the railroad property.

===Real estate===
A property condition assessment is the examination for purposes of evaluating a commercial or business property&#x27;s condition often as a part of a due diligence investigation for a company to know what it is buying. Building code officials do a building inspection to determine code compliance in new or altered buildings before issuing a certificate of occupancy. Residential inspections not for code compliance are called a home inspection. There are numerous types of more specific real estate and infrastructure inspections such as windstorm inspection, energy audit, and pipeline video inspection.

===Software inspection ===

<doc id="467894" wikidata="Q826714" url="?curid=467894" title="Prussian Settlement Commission">
<text>The Prussian Settlement Commission, officially known as the Royal Prussian Settlement Commission in the Provinces West Prussia and Posen (; ) was a Prussian government commission that operated between 1886 and 1924, but actively only until 1918. It was first up on the initiative of Otto von Bismarck to increase land ownership by ethnically German Germans at the expense of Poles in Germany, by economic and political means, in Prussia&#x27;s eastern provinces of West Prussia and the Posen as part of his larger efforts aiming at the end of Poles in Germany (especially as a distinctive, recognised and self-recognising group inhabiting a contiguous arena), the Germanisation of greater territories, in particular those under German rule and strengthening of and ascendancy of “Germandom” and the dominant German culture (in particular German Protestant culture) especially in the “East”, during the Kulturkampf though it survived it, and the end of the Bismarck-era generalised anti-Catholic government policy. 

The commission was ideologically motivated by German racism.

The commission was one of Prussia&#x27;s prime instruments in the official policy of Germanization of the historically Polish lands of West Prussia (the former Royal Prussia) and the dissolved Grand Duchy of Posen. The Commission ultimately purchased 613 estates from ethnic German owners and 214 from ethnic Poles, functioning to more often bail out German debtors rather than fulfilling its declared national mission. By the end of its existence, a total of 21,886 German families (154,704 persons) out of a planned 40,000 had been settled. The commission&#x27;s activities had a countereffect in Poles using what has been termed &quot;defensive nationalism&quot;, unifying &quot;Polish nationalism, Catholicism and cultural resistance&quot; and triggered countermeasures by the Polish minority. Efforts of new private initiatives by the minority, but actually a majority in wide parts of Posen and West Prussia province, who founded the Prussian banks &quot;Bank Ziemski&quot;, &quot;Bank Związku Spółek Zarobkowych&quot; (Vereinsbank der Erwerbsgenossenschaften) and local land acquisition cooperatives (spółki ziemskie) which collected private funds and succeeded to buy more latifundia from defaulted owners and settle more ethnically Polish Germans as farmers on the parcelled land than their governmentally funded counter-party. A big success of the Prussian activists for the Polish nation.

Nevertheless, this Polish success under difficult circumstances was little recognised, and after World War I, when the Second Polish Republic was established, new governmental Polish measures climaxed in the expropriation of Commission-owned lands and reversing Germanization. Some of the former colonists, then as ethnically German Poles part of the German minority in Poland, were active in a Nazi campaign of genocide against Poles during World War II.

==Name==
English translations include &quot;German Colonization Commission for Poznań&quot;, &quot;Prussian Colonization Commission&quot;&quot;The Royal Commission of Colonization for West Prussia and Posnania&quot;). The majority of Polish sources translate the title as Colonization Commission rather than Settlement Commission, which is more politically charged. The issue of translation is also connected to the fact that in 1904 the legal difference between settlement and colony was abolished in Prussia.

==Background==

===Kingdom of Prussia===
The Kingdom of Prussia during the partitions of Poland acquired West Prussia (, ) in 1772 and the later Province of Posen (&#x27;, &#x27;) in 1793 and 1815. The Polish language was abolished as an official language and the German language was introduced. Frederick the Great hoped to replace Poles with Germans, placing Germans in most of the administration as well. Poles were portrayed as &quot;backward Slavs&quot; by Prussian officials who acted to spread the German language and culture. The lands of Polish nobility were confiscated and given to German nobles. The Prussian hold on Polish areas was somewhat weakened after 1807 when parts of its partition were restored to the Duchy of Warsaw. The power status of Prussia was dependent on hindering any form of Polish statehood and it didn&#x27;t support Polish attempts at restoration of Poland during Congress of Vienna, when Prussia tried to obtain the Duchy of Warsaw or at least its western provinces. In 1815 the Prussian king made several guarantees in his speech to Poles in the newly formed Grand Duchy of Posen (created out of territories of Duchy of Warsaw) in regards to rights of the Polish language and cultural institutions.

However, in practice, the right to use Polish in courts and institutions was respected only until 1830. While the Poles constituted the majority of population in the area, they held only 4 out of 21 official posts of high level. Despite the colonizing actions between 1793 and 1806, in 1815 in Poznań only 11.1 per cent of the population was ethnically German. After 1832 Poles could no longer hold high posts at the local administrative level (landrat). At the same time the Prussian government and Prussian King pursued Germanization of the administrative and judicial systems, while local officials enforced Germanization of the educational system and tried to eradicate the economic position of Polish nobility. The provincial parliament issued calls to ensure the right of use of the Polish language and called for the creation of Polish educational institutions as well as autonomy, but those requests were rejected by the Prussian state. In 1847, two hundred fifty seven Polish activists were imprisoned upon charges of conspiracy and eight of them were sentenced to death, the Spring of Nations, however, stopped their execution. The Frankfurt Parliament showed that the German delegates refused to accept the rights of non-German peoples and, while the Prussian government declared itself ready to discuss Polish concerns, it soon ordered the Prussian military to crush the freedom movement of Polish activists and peasants. Afterwards, the victorious Prussian government retreated from its earlier declarations of autonomy in the Greater Poland region.

====Earlier settlement attempts by the Kingdom of Prussia====

Prior to the Prussian Settlement Commission (established in 1886) the Kingdom of Prussia had made a number of attempts to settle ethnic Germans in regions inhabited by ethnic Poles.

Frederick the Great, who treated Poles with contempt and called them &#x27;slovenly Polish trash&#x27;, settled around 300,000 colonists in the eastern provinces of Prussia and aimed at a removal of the Polish nobility. Another colonization attempt aimed at Germanisation was pursued by Prussia after 1832.

===German Empire===
In 1871, the German Empire was founded with Prussia being the leading and dominating state. The advent of the Kulturkampf marked a period, when the Prussian government attempted to Germanise the Poles through language, schooling, and religious restrictions. Later, the increase in the sheer numbers of Poles led the government to a direct anti-Polish demographic policy.
The Polish population in the Province of Posen (Poznań) made up for nearly 60% (1,049,000 Poles vs 702,000 Germans in 1890), and in West Prussia for one third of the population (484,000 Poles vs 949,000 Germans in 1890). By 1885, Prussia still faced difficulties digesting her &quot;Polish provinces&quot;, and the &quot;Polish Question&quot; was one of the Reich&#x27;s most pressing problems. The state itself was led by German nationalism and Bismarck viewed Poles as one of the chief threats to German power; as he declared &quot;The Polish question is to us a question of life and death&quot; and wanted Polish nation to disappear in private going as far as expressing his wish to exterminate Poles. As a result, the Polish population faced economic, religious and political discrimination as the Germanisation of their territories was promoted. In some places where Poles and Germans lived, it was a virtual apartheid state.

In the late 19th century, an east-to west migration (Ostflucht) took place, in which parts of the population of the eastern provinces migrated to western, more prosperous territories.
The German government was concerned that Ostflucht would lower the percentage of Germans in the eastern regions. This event was used as pretext and justification presented to the international community for actions aiming at Germanisation of those provinces. In reality both Poles, Jews and Germans moved to richer western German provinces.

==Goals==

The goals of the commission were the financial weakening of Polish landowners, and ensuring Germanisation of Polish cities as well as rural areas. The destruction of Polish landownership combined with the fight against the Polish clergy (Kulturkampf) was to achieve the elimination of a Polish national identity. Polish landowners were regarded by Bismarck as the principal agitators for Polish nationalism, purchasing their estates and parceling them out to Germans in family-sized farms was intended to both disestablish this group and significantly increase the numbers of Germans in these areas.

The focus on land ownership was motived by the German &quot;völkisch&quot; idea that &quot;where the German plough will plow, there German fatherland will arise&quot;. The settlement was to isolate Polish settlements in German inhabited areas by surrounding them with German settlements and spread German ones into Polish dominated areas to isolate specified Polish villages from the rest. The German settlements were to be always concentrated to provide a &quot;barrier&quot; to Polishness. While the Commission bought mostly German land, this was not interfering with the goal of increase of German presence, and buying a large tract of land from a single German owner to distribute it among many German colonists was perceived as beneficial to the goal. Of the colonists, 96.9% were Protestants as the Prussian authorities believed that ‘the true German is a Protestant&quot;. The whole practice was new and unheard in Europe. Besides Ostflucht, the German government justified its action to the international community by labeling Poles as internal enemies of the state. Those attempts did not achieve much success. Bismarck himself said that the Poles who find themselves without land should &quot;move to Morocco&quot;.

==Funding==

The funding for the commission was:
* 1886 100 million marks
* 1898 100 million marks
* 1908 150 million marks
* 1913 500 million marks

By 1914 the overall funding for the commission was 955 million marks. Additional funds were awarded to assistance projects such crediting bankrupt German estates (125 million marks in 1908).

Due to operations of the commission the price of land in Polish territories rose in response. The economical attempt to Germanise those areas failed and with the beginning of World War I, German authorities and leading members of Commission started to look for new ways to secure German foothold on Polish territory.

==Acquisitions settlement and land purchase==

While the commission planned to settle up to 40,000 families in Posen and West Prussia, it only managed to settle a total of 21,866 families until 1914, bringing the number of German colonists to 154,000.

===Acquisitions by 1901===

From 26 April 1886 until 1 January 1901, the Settlement Commission purchased 147,475 ha (3.64% of the Province of Posen and 1.65% of West Prussia), and settled 4,277 families (about 30,000 persons). A publication from German Empire named &quot;Meyers Großes Konversations-Lexikon&quot; claimed that in 1905-1906 that only 2,715 families were not native to these provinces. After this, the original budget of 100,000,000 marks was exhausted.

===Acquisitions by 1913===

By 1913, the SC had bought up about 5.4% of the land in West Prussia and 10.4% in Posen. By then, 450 new villages were founded, a total area of 438,560 ha was purchased, of which 124,903 ha were purchased from Poles. In 1914, Germans owned 59% of land in Province of Posen, while making up for about 40% of population in 1890.

===Overall===

Throughout its 32 years of existence the commission was able to buy 8% of the total land in Posen and West Prussia. Altogether, about 22,000 families were settled, bringing the number of German colonists to 154,000. 5,400 families were German arrivals taken from other parts of the partitioned Poland, Congress Poland (Russian Empire province) and Galicia (Austrian province).

Overall, the commission bought 828 estates (430,450 ha) for 443 million marks, 214 of those (115,525 ha) from Poles for 96,4 million marks, and the other 614 (314,926 ha) from Germans for 346,7 million marks. Further the commission bought 631 peasant farms (30,434 ha) for 44,5 million marks, 274 of those (11,152 ha) from Poles for 16,6 million marks and the other 357 (19,282 ha) from Germans for 27,9 million marks. Of the total of 955 million marks spent, about half (488 million marks) was spent for the actual land purchase, while the rest was spent for administration, parcellisation, infrastructure etc.

==Origin of the settlers==
To Germanise the region predominantly German military units were sent and later included in the region&#x27;s population figures.
Germans from West Prussia and Greater Poland region who took part in the settlement process declined over time, while the number of Germans from the Russian Empire increased. In the first years (1886–90), locals from Greater Poland and West Prussia constituted 48% of the settlers while the proportion of Germans from Russia was below 1%, however in the years 1902–1906, locals only made up for 17% and Germans from Russia for 29% of the settlers.

Of those settled until the end of 1906, a quarter originated in Posen and West Prussia, another quarter in the neighboring provinces of East Prussia, Pomerania, Brandenburg, Saxony and Silesia, 30% from other parts of the German Empire and 20% from outside the empire, especially from Russia.

==Impact on the ethnic composition==

One of the chief aims of the commission was to stop the restoration of Polish population in Germanised territories of Greater Poland which was restoring its numbers after drastic fall during initial Prussian takeover. While the Commission never fully realised its goals, it managed to weaken Polish influence.
In Greater Poland the Polish share of the population didn&#x27;t reach its pre-1815 levels:


According to Władysław Kulski the commission was only a part of the German efforts to eradicate Poles from territories conquered by Prussia from Poland;in addition to 154,000 colonists, Germany also settled 378,000 German military personnel and officials in Polish territories.

==Legislation==

As the economic approach showed to be a failure, various laws were enacted to promote the Settlement Commission&#x27;s aims.

* 1896: Land acquired from the commission could be sold freely only to the settler&#x27;s next of kin: the commission&#x27;s approval was required for any other sale.
* 1904: The Prussian Government sought to restrict Poles from acquiring land, if this would interfere with the goals of the commission. Any new settlement required a building permit, even if it were only for renovation of an existing building to make it habitable. Local officials routinely denied these permits to Poles. The law faced international criticism and opposition from liberal groups concerned about private property rights. The Prussian Administrative High Court ended this legislation.
* 1908: The Prussian diet passed a law permitting the forcible expropriation of Polish landowners by the Settlement Commission. In 1912, four Polish large estates of 1,656 ha were expropriated. The law faced criticism from international community and liberals concerned about the free market rights. Additionally, the Austrian State Council, upon the request of the Poles, who enjoyed considerable autonomy and influence in Austro-Hungary, condemned the actions of German government. Rota, a patriotic poem by Maria Konopnicka was created as response to this law. According to historian Andrzej Chwalba, more than one newspaper in Europe wrote that Prussia was becoming a police state. In part due to those protests, the law&#x27;s execution was delayed until 1914.
* 1913: To prevent Poles redistributing their land to other Poles, a law was passed that forbade the dividing of private land without the agreement of the state.

Other measures in support of the Germanisation policy included:
* Ethnic Germans were favoured in government contracts and only they won them, while Poles always lost.
* Ethnic Germans were also promoted in investment plans, supply contracts.
* German craftsmen in Polish territories received the best locations in cities from authorities so that they could start their own business and prosper.
* Soldiers received orders that banned them from buying in Polish shops and from Poles under the threat of arrest.
* German merchantmen were encouraged to settle in Polish territories.
* Tax incentives and beneficial financial arrangements were proposed to German officials and clerks if they would settle in Polish inhabited provinces.

==Polish countermeasures==

The creation of the Commission stimulated Poles to take countermeasures, that gradually turned into a competition of the Polish minority against the German state with Poles running their own settlement banks and settlement societies, resulting in a &quot;battle for soil&quot; (&quot;Kampf um den Boden&quot;). In 1888 Teodor Kalkstein founded Bank Ziemski, supported by Poles from Austrian Galicia region. 1894 saw Polish intellectuals in cooperation with Polish farmers founding &quot;Spólka Rolników Indywidualnych&quot;. Ignacy Sikorski founded &quot;Bank Parcelacyjny&quot; in 1896. From 1890 till 1912 Polish enterprises, banks and associations grew in number and strength providing Poles with defence against the Germanisation of their land. The efforts to Germanise the region in fact strengthened the Polish nationalist movement and united Polish nationalism, Catholicism and cultural resistance among the Poles in Pomerania, Masuria and Silesia. For the Settlement Commission, these countermeasures led to a decreasing availability of purchasable Polish-owned land, in 1895 and all years following 1898, the vast majority of estates was purchased from Germans instead of Poles, and since 1902, the commission was able to acquire land from Poles &quot;only rarely and only through a middleman&quot;.

Numerous initiatives proved to be more elastic and efficient than the large centralised German bureaucracy. A social understanding has risen among the Polish population that led to abandoning the class differences in order to defend national existence - the rich helped the poor to perform better in economy and were supported by the clergy in their actions. Rich nobility often sold their artistic heritage to invest in banking and financial enterprises, or to buy more land for Poles. This was viewed as moral and ethical behavior among the Polish population. Some Polish nationalists accused the Settlement Commission of being run by Germans and Jews, and distributed a leaflet in 1912 that warned &quot;any Pole who buys from Jews and Germans undermines the existence of the Catholic Church and the Fatherland.&quot; Local newspapers attempted to intimidate residents who purchased goods from German and Jewish merchants by publishing their names in the paper and accusing them of &quot;betray[ing]...their country.&quot;

As a result, the German initiative created the very thing it tried to eliminate in the first place, a Polish national awakening in the Greater Poland region (Province of Posen) and feeling of Polish national unity.
Thus, faced with the inability to Germanise the Polish provinces by economic means led the German leaders and thinkers to consider pursuing extraordinary means. Catherine Epstein named Polish resistance to German methods as strengthening Polish nationalism and notes the similarity of Commission actions to the Nazis.

==First World War==

Even before the First World War, some Germans, like Hans Delbrück or Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow, proposed expelling Poles from the eastern territories of Germany. With the coming of the war, those ideas began to take real and determined form in the shape of plans to be realised after German victory and, as a consequence, hegemony of Central and Eastern Europe. The idea of extraordinary measures was the result of the failed economic attempt to Germanise Polish provinces. Heads of the Settlement Commission were among the architects and supporters of those plans. The president of the Settlement Commission, Gense, was one of the chief supporters and planners of the so-called &quot;Polish Border Strip&quot; that envisioned expelling circa 2 million non-Germans (chiefly Poles and Jews) from 30,000 square kilometers of the would-be annexed territories from Congress Poland, which would then become Germanised. The Poles remaining in Germany who would refuse to become Germanised were to be &quot;encouraged&quot; to move to a planned German-run Polish puppet state established from the remains of Congress Poland.

Other notable names of Settlement Commission activists include Friedrich von Schwerin and industrialist Alfred Hugenberg who worked for and represented the Krupp family.

==Outcome==

The Settlement Commission&#x27;s goal to Germanise Polish territories failed and with the fall of German Empire in 1918 (at the end of World War I), the Commission ceased to function by 1924. In 1919 its headquarters were taken over by Polish state as well as most of its territory. 3.9% (18,200 ha.) of all the land purchased remained in the hands of the Germans within the new borders of Germany. The Germanisation policies resulted in strong measures against the German settlers by the Polish state after World War I. The Polish state refused to recognize the ownership rights of most of the German settlers, about half of whom fled or were driven out of Poland. These actions of the Polish state were condemned by the Permanent Court of International Justice, ruling out in 1923 &quot;that the position adopted by the Polish Government [...] was not in conformity with its international obligations.&quot; By 1918, the total ethnic Polish population was greater than when the commission began operations. Between 1918 and 1939, the German population in these areas declined by another 70%, and the land owned by Germans by 45%.

==Influence on Nazism==
Prussian policies of settlement and forced assimilation were an influence for German Nazi thinkers during their war in the East. Their plans were a renovation of the idea, this time however rather than colonize just the land purchased by Prussian Settlement Commission, Poles would be ethnically cleansed and murdered, and German colonists would occupy their place. The Nazis planned also to form a Reich Settlement Commission to coordinate all internal colonization within German Reich, which was to be based on Prussian Settlement Commission. The plan was laid out by Nazi official Curt von Gottberg, who presented it to Himmler, and as reward was appointed as Land Registry Chief in Prague in June 1939.

<doc id="467896" wikidata="Q1034734" url="?curid=467896" title="Fading Suns">
<text>Fading Suns is a science fiction space opera role-playing game published by Holistic Design. The setting was also used for a PC game (&quot;Emperor of the Fading Suns&quot;), a live action role-playing game (&quot;Passion Play&quot;), and for a space combat miniature game (&quot;Noble Armada&quot;).

==History==
After the computer game &quot;Machiavelli the Prince&quot;, Holistic Design looked to try something new - a space strategy computer game, which ultimately became &quot;Emperor of the Fading Suns&quot; (1996). Holistic commissioned Andrew Greenberg and Bill Bridges to use their world building experience to create a universe for the game, which would also be used as the setting for a tabletop role-playing game to be released simultaneously. Greenberg and Bridges had previously helped define the style of White Wolf Publishing&#x27;s World of Darkness and, according to Shannon Appelcline, people noticed this game&#x27;s similarity to the &quot;White Wolf style&quot;. Appelcline comments further: &quot;Fading Suns is unique mainly for its distinctive setting. It is a hard science-fiction game, but much of the universe has fallen back to Medieval technology: noble houses, guilds and a monolithic church control most of the power in the universe. Many people compare the universe to that of Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot;, though Bridges points to Gene Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the New Sun&quot;, Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; and others as his inspiration.&quot; &quot;Fading Suns&quot; was well supported with supplements for a few years and in that time the line sold well. Holistic released the table-top miniatures game &quot;Noble Armada&quot; (1998), which was designed by Ken Lightner and Chris Wiese as a spaceship combat game intended to compatible with &quot;Fading Suns&quot;. &quot;Passion Play&quot; (1999) was a live action role-playing game for &quot;Fading Suns&quot;. Holistic published a d20 version of &quot;Fading Suns&quot; (2001), and then published their later &quot;Fading Suns&quot; supplements with dual sets of statistics to use them for both d20 and their own &quot;Victory Point System&quot;. Over the next few years Holistic announced that they were working on a third edition of &quot;Fading Suns&quot; as well as new games which would have been designed using the d20 Modern rules and would have explored different periods in the history of &quot;Fading Suns&quot;, but none of these products were released. In 2007 Holistic Design licensed &quot;Fading Suns&quot; to RedBrick, and in 2012 the license passed to FASA Games, Inc, which released a revised edition of &quot;Fading Suns&quot; later that year. In 2014 FASA Games announced they would be releasing a new version of &quot;Noble Armada&quot;. In 2016 Holistic Design licensed the publishing rights for &quot;Fading Suns&quot; to Ulisses Spiele, who announced they were planning a new edition, with products published in both English and German. FASA Games retained the license for &quot;Noble Armada&quot; products and miniatures.

== Game setting ==
The action is set in the Known Worlds, a future medieval-analogue empire built on the remains of a previous, more sophisticated human space-faring civilization made possible by ancient &quot;jumpgates&quot;. The jumpgates are relics left by the mysterious Anunnaki, an ancient civilization (or civilizations) which seem to have influenced the evolution of lesser species, such as humans, for their own end, and waged a devastating war many millennia ago using them as tools and weapons.

The atmosphere is strongly reminiscent of Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; and of the &quot;Hyperion&quot; stories by Dan Simmons, but is influenced by many other science fiction and horror books and movies as well, including the Cthulhu Mythos. The Known Worlds are a very superstitious and dangerous place.

Power is administered by five major Noble Houses, five major guilds within the Merchants League, and six major sects of the Universal Church of the Celestial Sun.

While most role-playing situations arise from the strict codes regulating the everyday life of the empire&#x27;s citizens, the Imperial Age is rife with opportunities for adventure. Following the fall of the old regime, and centuries of darkness and warfare, most worlds have slipped backward to a technology level not much more advanced than 21st century Earth, and a number of alien threats lurk in the shadows. Pushing at the borders of the Known Worlds lurk the mutangenic horror of the Symbiots, the ancient and enigmatic Vau, and the barbarian empires of the Kurgan and the Vuldrok, all waiting for their chance to throw humanity into darkness and chaos.

Players can take the role of either a member of a Noble House, of one of the various merchant guilds, or a member of one of the numerous religious sects. A number of alien species, most notably the human-like &#x27;psychic&#x27; Ukar and Obun, and the six-limbed, bestial Vorox, are also available as player characters.

Two separate types of occult abilities exist within the game universe: psychic powers and Theurgy. Psychic powers manifest, generally, from the practitioners&#x27; own mental abilities. Psionicists, castigated as &#x27;demon worshippers&#x27; and heretics, are often hunted down and killed by the Church, or enrolled in the Church&#x27;s ranks (after a good bit of &#x27;re-training&#x27;). Theurgy is a kind of ordained divine sorcery practiced by the Church through various approved rites and is capable of producing miracles, often by calling on the assistance of various saints and angels.

A large library of supplements provides descriptions of locales (planets, space stations, whole sections of space), alien societies, minor houses, guilds and sects, monsters and secret conspiracies, thus expanding the thematic possibilities offered by the setting.

== Game system ==
The &quot;Fading Suns&quot; engine uses a simple attribute and skill, level and classless, single d20-powered system, called the Victory Point System (VPS). The second edition of the game&#x27;s rules solved many issues raised by the earlier rule book, while increasing the amount of data available. The current Revised Edition further updated and streamlined the VPS mechanics.

While generally stereotypical in their template-like form, characters are easily personalized through either life path or points-buy systems.

In 2000, an adaptation of the setting to the popular 3 edition OGL system was also published - &quot;D20 Fading Suns&quot;. For several years, supplements carried rules for both systems.

Holistic Design has released a LARP version of &quot;Fading Suns&quot; entitled &quot;Passion Play&quot;.

A fourth edition of Fading Suns is in development, helmed by original writer Bill Bridges.

== Authors ==
&quot;Fading Suns&quot; was written by Andrew Greenberg and Bill Bridges, known for their involvement with the original &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; role-playing games both published by White Wolf Publishing.

==Reception==
In the August 1997 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 238), Rick Swan liked the somber setting, but criticized the task resolution system: &quot;Inexplicably, the designers pile on the numbers, adding stuff like effect dice, effect numbers, and complementary actions, all of which are intended to make task resolution more realistic, but just make it more confusing.&quot; But Swan liked the rest of the game, and gave it a rating of 5 out of 6, saying, &quot;Although &quot;Fading Suns&quot; fails to scale the heights of &quot;Traveller&quot; — the setting isn&#x27;t as rich, and the rules, though solid, aren&#x27;t nearly as elegant — it succeeds on its own terms, evoking a vividly imagined future where street smarts count more than computer literacy, where betrayal and despair are more common than sunshine. With nearly 50 pages of background to digest, it&#x27;s not the easiest game to get into. But for players who like a little anguish with their space opera, it&#x27;s worth the effort.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath commented that this game inspired several later videogames, pointing out &quot;In addition to &quot;Mass Effect&quot;, there are glimmers of &quot;Fading Suns&quot; in other science fiction videogames, like &quot;StarCraft&quot; and the &quot;Dead Space&quot; series.&quot;

<text>Systems biology is the computational and mathematical analysis and modeling of complex biological systems. It is a biology-based interdisciplinary field of study that focuses on complex interactions within biological systems, using a holistic approach (holism instead of the more traditional reductionism) to biological research.

Particularly from the year 2000 onwards, the concept has been used widely in biology in a variety of contexts. The Human Genome Project is an example of applied systems thinking in biology which has led to new, collaborative ways of working on problems in the biological field of genetics. One of the aims of systems biology is to model and discover emergent properties, properties of cells, tissues and organisms functioning as a system whose theoretical description is only possible using techniques of systems biology. These typically involve metabolic networks or cell signaling networks.

== Overview ==

Systems biology can be considered from a number of different aspects.

As a field of study, particularly, the study of the interactions between the components of biological systems, and how these interactions give rise to the function and behavior of that system (for example, the enzymes and metabolites in a metabolic pathway or the heart beats).

As a paradigm, systems biology is usually defined in antithesis to the so-called reductionist paradigm (biological organisation), although it is consistent with the scientific method. The distinction between the two paradigms is referred to in these quotations: &quot;the reductionist approach has successfully identified most of the components and many of the interactions but, unfortunately, offers no convincing concepts or methods to understand how system properties emerge ... the pluralism of causes and effects in biological networks is better addressed by observing, through quantitative measures, multiple components simultaneously and by rigorous data integration with mathematical models.&quot; (Sauer &quot;et al.&quot;) &quot;Systems biology ... is about putting together rather than taking apart, integration rather than reduction. It requires that we develop ways of thinking about integration that are as rigorous as our reductionist programmes, but different. ... It means changing our philosophy, in the full sense of the term.&quot; (Denis Noble)

As a series of operational protocols used for performing research, namely a cycle composed of theory, analytic or computational modelling to propose specific testable hypotheses about a biological system, experimental validation, and then using the newly acquired quantitative description of cells or cell processes to refine the computational model or theory. Since the objective is a model of the interactions in a system, the experimental techniques that most suit systems biology are those that are system-wide and attempt to be as complete as possible. Therefore, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics and high-throughput techniques are used to collect quantitative data for the construction and validation of models.

As the application of dynamical systems theory to molecular biology. Indeed, the focus on the dynamics of the studied systems is the main conceptual difference between systems biology and bioinformatics.

As a socioscientific phenomenon defined by the strategy of pursuing integration of complex data about the interactions in biological systems from diverse experimental sources using interdisciplinary tools and personnel.

== History ==
Although the concept of a systems view of cellular function has been well understood since at least the 1930s, technological limitations made it difficult to make systems wide measurements. The advent of microarray technology in the 1990s opened up an entire new visa for studying cells at the systems level. In 2000, the Institute for Systems Biology was established in Seattle in an effort to lure &quot;computational&quot; type people who it was felt were not attracted to the academic settings of the university. The institute did not have a clear definition of what the field actually was: roughly bringing together people from diverse fields to use computers to holistically study biology in new ways. A Department of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School was launched in 2003. In 2006 it was predicted that the buzz generated by the &quot;very fashionable&quot; new concept would cause all the major universities to need a systems biology department, thus that there would be careers available for graduates with a modicum of ability in computer programming and biology. In 2006 the National Science Foundation put forward a challenge to build a mathematical model of the whole cell. In 2012 the first whole-cell model of &quot;Mycoplasma genitalium&quot; was achieved by the Covert Laboratory at Stanford University. The whole-cell model is able to predict viability of &quot;M. genitalium&quot; cells in response to genetic mutations.

An earlier precursor of systems biology, as a distinct discipline, may have been by systems theorist Mihajlo Mesarovic in 1966 with an international symposium at the Case Institute of Technology in Cleveland, Ohio, titled &quot;Systems Theory and Biology&quot;. Mesarovic predicted that perhaps in the future there would be such a thing as &quot;systems biology&quot;. Other early precursors that focused on the view that biology should be analyzed as a system, rather than a simple collection of parts, were Metabolic Control Analysis, developed by Henrik Kacser and Jim Burns later thoroughly revised, and Reinhart Heinrich and Tom Rapoport, and Biochemical Systems Theory developed by Michael Savageau.

According to Robert Rosen in the 1960s, holistic biology had become passé by the early 20th century, as more empirical science dominated by molecular chemistry had become popular. Echoing him forty years later in 2006 Kling writes that the success of molecular biology throughout the 20th century had suppressed holistic computational methods. By 2011 the National Institutes of Health had made grant money available to support over ten systems biology centers in the United States, but by 2012 Hunter writes that systems biology still has someway to go to achieve its full potential. Nonetheless, proponents hoped that it might once prove more useful in the future.


An important milestone in the development of systems biology has become the international project Physiome.

== Associated disciplines ==

According to the interpretation of systems biology as using large data sets using interdisciplinary tools, a typical application is metabolomics, which is the complete set of all the metabolic products, metabolites, in the system at the organism, cell, or tissue level.

Items that may be a computer database include: phenomics, organismal variation in phenotype as it changes during its life span; genomics, organismal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence, including intra-organismal cell specific variation. (i.e., telomere length variation); epigenomics/epigenetics, organismal and corresponding cell specific transcriptomic regulating factors not empirically coded in the genomic sequence. (i.e., DNA methylation, Histone acetylation and deacetylation, etc.); transcriptomics, organismal, tissue or whole cell gene expression measurements by DNA microarrays or serial analysis of gene expression; interferomics, organismal, tissue, or cell-level transcript correcting factors (i.e., RNA interference), proteomics, organismal, tissue, or cell level measurements of proteins and peptides via two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry or multi-dimensional protein identification techniques (advanced HPLC systems coupled with mass spectrometry). Sub disciplines include phosphoproteomics, glycoproteomics and other methods to detect chemically modified proteins; glycomics, organismal, tissue, or cell-level measurements of carbohydrates; lipidomics, organismal, tissue, or cell level measurements of lipids.

The molecular interactions within the cell are also studied, this is called interactomics. A discipline in this field of study is protein–protein interactions, although interactomics includes the interactions of other molecules. Neuroelectrodynamics, where the computer&#x27;s or a brain&#x27;s computing function as a dynamic system is studied along with its (bio)physical mechanisms; and fluxomics, measurements of the rates of metabolic reactions in a biological system (cell, tissue, or organism).

In approaching a systems biology problem there are two main approaches. These are the top down and bottom up approach. The top down approach takes as much of the system into account as possible and relies largely on experimental results. The RNA-Seq technique is an example of an experimental top down approach. Conversely, the bottom up approach is used to create detailed models while also incorporating experimental data. An example of the bottom up approach is the use of circuit models to describe a simple gene network.

Various technologies utilized to capture dynamic changes in mRNA, proteins, and post-translational modifications. Mechanobiology, forces and physical properties at all scales, their interplay with other regulatory mechanisms; biosemiotics, analysis of the system of sign relations of an organism or other biosystems; Physiomics, a systematic study of physiome in biology.

Cancer systems biology is an example of the systems biology approach, which can be distinguished by the specific object of study (tumorigenesis and treatment of cancer). It works with the specific data (patient samples, high-throughput data with particular attention to characterizing cancer genome in patient tumour samples) and tools (immortalized cancer cell lines, mouse models of tumorigenesis, xenograft models, high-throughput sequencing methods, siRNA-based gene knocking down high-throughput screenings, computational modeling of the consequences of somatic mutations and genome instability). The long-term objective of the systems biology of cancer is ability to better diagnose cancer, classify it and better predict the outcome of a suggested treatment, which is a basis for personalized cancer medicine and virtual cancer patient in more distant prospective. Significant efforts in computational systems biology of cancer have been made in creating realistic multi-scale &quot;in silico&quot; models of various tumours.

The systems biology approach often involves the development of mechanistic models, such as the reconstruction of dynamic systems from the quantitative properties of their elementary building blocks. For instance, a cellular network can be modelled mathematically using methods coming from chemical kinetics and control theory. Due to the large number of parameters, variables and constraints in cellular networks, numerical and computational techniques are often used (e.g., flux balance analysis).

== Bioinformatics and data analysis ==
Other aspects of computer science, informatics, and statistics are also used in systems biology. These include new forms of computational models, such as the use of process calculi to model biological processes (notable approaches include stochastic π-calculus, BioAmbients, Beta Binders, BioPEPA, and Brane calculus) and constraint-based modeling; integration of information from the literature, using techniques of information extraction and text mining; development of online databases and repositories for sharing data and models, approaches to database integration and software interoperability via loose coupling of software, websites and databases, or commercial suits; network-based approaches for analyzing high dimensional genomic data sets. For example, weighted correlation network analysis is often used for identifying clusters (referred to as modules), modeling the relationship between clusters, calculating fuzzy measures of cluster (module) membership, identifying intramodular hubs, and for studying cluster preservation in other data sets; pathway-based methods for omics data analysis, e.g. approaches to identify and score pathways with differential activity of their gene, protein, or metabolite members. Much of the analysis of genomic data sets also include identifying correlations. Additionally, as much of the information comes from different fields, the development of syntactically and semantically sound ways of representing biological models is needed.

== Creating biological models ==

Researchers begin by choosing a biological pathway and diagramming all of the protein, gene, and/or metabolic pathways. After determining all of the interactions, mass action kinetics or enzyme kinetic rate laws are used to describe the speed of the reactions in the system. Using mass-conservation, the differential equations for the biological system can be constructed. Experiments or parameter fitting can be done to determine the parameter values to use in the differential equations. These parameter values will be the various kinetic constants required to fully describe the model. This model determines the behavior of species in biological systems and bring new insight to the specific activities of systems. Sometimes it is not possible to gather all reaction rates of a system. Unknown reaction rates are determined by simulating the model of known parameters and target behavior which provides possible parameter values.

The use of constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) methods has become popular among systems biologists to simulate and predict the metabolic phenotypes, using genome-scale models. One of the methods is the flux balance analysis (FBA) approach, by which one can study the biochemical networks and analyze the flow of metabolites through a particular metabolic network, by optimizing the objective function of interest (e.g. maximizing biomass production to predict growth).

<text>The &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; class was a group of eight pre-dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy in the 1890s. The ships spent their careers in the Mediterranean, Home and Channel Fleets, sometimes as flagships, although several were mobilised for service with the Flying Squadron in 1896 when tensions with the German Empire were high following the Jameson Raid in South Africa. Three ships were assigned to the International Squadron formed when Greek Christians rebelled against the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s rule in Crete in 1897–1898.

By about 1905–1907, they were considered obsolete and were reduced to reserve. The ships began to be sold off for scrap beginning in 1911, although was sunk as a target ship during gunnery trials in 1913. was fitted with the first anti-torpedo bulges to evaluate underwater protection schemes in 1911 before being scuttled as a blockship a few months after the start of the First World War in August 1914. Only survived to see active service in the war, during which she bombarded the Belgian coastline. Renamed &quot;Redoubtable&quot; in 1915, she was hulked later that year as an accommodation ship until she was sold for scrap after the war.

==Background==

By the late 1880s pressure on the government to modernise and expand the Royal Navy was building. A war scare with Russia in 1885 during the Panjdeh Incident, the failure of the blockading fleet to contain the raiding ships in port during the 1888 fleet manoeuvres and more realistic evaluations of the numbers of ships required to perform the tasks required in a war against France, coupled with exposés by influential journalists like W. T. Stead, revealed serious weaknesses in the Navy. The Government responded with the Naval Defence Act 1889, which provided £21.5 million for a vast expansion programme of which the eight ships of the &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; class were the centrepiece. The Act also formalised the two-power standard, whereby the Royal Navy sought to be as large as the next two major naval powers combined.

Preliminary work on what would become the &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;s began in 1888 and the Board of Admiralty directed the Director of Naval Construction, Sir William White, to design an improved and enlarged version of the . These ships were equipped with gun turrets, the weight of which dictated that they be low-freeboard ships to reduce their topweight. White, however, argued strenuously for a high-freeboard design to improve the new ships&#x27; ability to fight and steam in heavy weather. This meant that the armament could only be mounted in lighter, less-heavily armoured barbettes. After much discussion, the board came around to White&#x27;s view and the design resembled an enlarged version of the earlier , although one of the eight ships, , was built as a low-freeboard turret ship in deference to the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Arthur Hood, who had strongly argued for the type. The &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;s are often considered the first of the type of battleship which would become known after the commissioning of the revolutionary in 1906 as pre-dreadnoughts.

==Design and description==
The ships displaced at normal load and at deep load. They had a length between perpendiculars of and an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of .

Originally, the class was intended to be equipped with a new wire wound, 40 caliber long 12 inch gun. However the ship was instead fitted with 13.5 inch guns, similar to the ones found on the &quot;Admirals&quot; series of ships, as the board required 4 of the heaviest guns available, on the ship.

Those ships fitted with barbettes had a freeboard of (about 90% of modern guidelines), provided by the addition of a complete extra deck, which improved their performance in heavy seas. To reduce their topweight, White gave them a significant amount of tumblehome. &quot;Hood&quot;″s freeboard, however, was only , which meant that she was very wet and lost speed rapidly as wave height increased. She was the last British battleship with the heavy, old-style, turrets and all future British battleships were of a high-freeboard design and had their main armament in barbettes, although the adoption of armoured, rotating gunhouses over the barbettes gradually led to them being called &quot;turrets&quot; as well.
Another issue with &quot;Hood&quot; was that the stability of a ship is largely due to freeboard at high rolling angles, so she had to be given a larger metacentric height (the vertical distance between the metacentre and the centre of gravity below it) of around instead of the of the rest of the &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;s to make her roll less in rough seas. This had the effect of making her roll period shorter by around 7% compared to her sister ship, which in turn made her gunnery less accurate. White had purposely selected a high metacentric height to minimise rolling and he did not think that bilge keels were needed. When experienced heavy rolling during a heavy storm in December 1893, which earned the class the nickname &quot;Rolling Ressies&quot;, her sister, , was fitted with bilge keels while still fitting out and conclusively demonstrated their effectiveness during comparative trials.
The &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;s were powered by a pair of three-cylinder, vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by eight cylindrical boilers that operated at a pressure of . The engines were designed to produce a total of at normal draught and a speed of ; using forced draught, they were expected to produce and a maximum speed of . The &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;-class ships comfortably exceeded these speeds; herself reached from with natural draught. Trials at forced draught, however, damaged her boilers, although the ship attained from . As a result, the Navy decided not to push the boilers of the &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; class past 11,000 ihp to prevent similar damage. The ships carried a maximum of of coal, which gave them a range of at a speed of .

===Armament and armour===

A new and more powerful gun was preferred by the Board, but it was still under development, so the 32-calibre BL gun used in the preceding classes was chosen. The four guns were mounted in two twin-gun, pear-shaped barbettes or circular turrets, one forward and one aft of the superstructure. The barbettes were open, without hoods or gun shields, and the guns were fully exposed. The ammunition hoists were in the apex of the barbette and the guns had to return to the fore-and-aft position to be reloaded. The shells fired by these guns were credited with the ability to penetrate of wrought iron at , using a charge of of smokeless brown cocoa (SBC). At maximum elevation of +13.5°, the guns had a range of around with SBC; later a charge of of cordite was substituted for the SBC which extended the range to about . The ships carried 80 rounds for each gun.

The secondary armament of ten quick-firing (QF) guns was a significant upgrade over the six QF guns of the &quot;Trafalgar&quot; class. These guns were intended to destroy the unarmoured structure of their opponents and they were widely spaced on two decks so that a single hit would not disable more than one. Four of the guns were situated on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather because they were so close to the ships&#x27; waterline, while the remaining guns were above them on the upper deck. Together with their ammunition supply of 200 rounds per gun, the guns weighed about and were one of the reasons for the large increase in displacement over the earlier ships. The guns fired their shells to a range of at their maximum elevation of +20°. Sixteen QF 6-pounder guns of an unknown type and a dozen QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats (&quot;Hood&quot; only had eight 6-pounders). The &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;-class ships also mounted seven 14-inch (356 mm) torpedo tubes, two submerged and four above water on the broadside, plus one above water in the stern.

The &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;s&#x27; armour scheme was similar to that of the &quot;Trafalgar&quot;s, as the waterline belt of compound armour only protected the area between the barbettes. The belt was long and had a total height of of which was below water. Transverse bulkheads (forward) and 14 inches (aft) thick formed the central armoured citadel. Above the belt was a strake of armour, backed by deep coal bunkers, that was terminated by oblique bulkheads that connected the upper side armour to the barbettes. The plates of the upper strake were Harvey armour only in &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;; her sisters had nickel steel, although &quot;Hood&quot;″s plates were thick.

The barbettes and gun turrets were protected by compound armour, ranging in thickness from and the casemates for the main deck 6-inch guns had a thickness equal to their diameter. The ammunition hoists to the main deck secondary guns were thick while those for the upper deck guns were twice that. The submerged armour deck was 3 inches thick amidships and reduced to towards the ends of the ship; the forward end curved downwards to reinforce the plough-shaped ram. The walls of the forward conning tower were thick and the communications tube that ran down to the armour deck was in thickness. The aft conning tower was protected by 3-inch plates, as was its communication tube. Between 1902 and 1904, the thin gun shields protecting the upper deck 6-inch guns were replaced by armoured casemates in all the ships except &quot;Hood&quot;, whose lack of stability prevented the addition of such weights high in the ship.

==Modifications==
Bilge keels were fitted in 1894–1895 to all ships that lacked them. The three-pounder guns in the upper fighting tops were removed from all ships in 1899–1902 as were the gun shields of the guns in the lower fighting tops, except in &quot;Empress of India&quot; which retained hers until 1903–1904. The above-water torpedo tubes were removed from all ships in 1902–1905 and armoured casemates were fitted to the 6-inch guns on the upper deck between 1902 and 1904. Fire-control equipment and rangefinders were installed in every ship in 1905–1908 and all light guns had been removed from the main deck and the fighting tops by 1909. The after bridge was removed from all but &quot;Revenge&quot; in 1910. Two years later that ship had her guns relined down to 10 inches (254 mm) for testing; the liners were removed in October 1912.

After the start of the First World War, &quot;Revenge&quot; was modified for coast bombardment duties. To extend the range of her guns, they were relined down to 12 inches (305 mm). The following year, she had anti-torpedo bulges fitted.

==Operational history==
&quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;, &quot;Repulse&quot;, &quot;Resolution&quot; and &quot;Empress of India&quot; were initially assigned to the Channel Fleet, with &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; serving as the fleet flagship and the latter ship as the flagship of the second-in-command. &quot;Revenge&quot; and &quot;Royal Oak&quot; were commissioned into the Flying Squadron in 1896 when tensions with the German Empire were high following the Jameson Raid in South Africa, with the former as the flagship. &quot;Ramillies&quot; became flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet and was joined by &quot;Hood&quot;. All of the Channel Fleet ships participated in Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee fleet review in 1897. &quot;Empress of India&quot; and &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; were transferred to the Mediterranean shortly after the review although only the former ship joined &quot;Ramillies&quot; and &quot;Hood&quot; as part of the International Squadron, a multinational force that intervened in the 1897–1898 Greek Christian uprising against the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s rule in Crete.

Beginning in 1900 those ships deployed in the Mediterranean, except for &quot;Hood&quot;, began returning home and often served as a coastguard or guard ship before beginning a long refit in 1902–1903. &quot;Empress of India&quot; was the first of the sisters to be refitted and was the only ship of the class present at King Edward VII&#x27;s Coronation Fleet Review in August 1902. The ship served as the flagship of the Home Fleet&#x27;s second-in-command after her refit until she was relieved by &quot;Royal Oak&quot; in 1904. &quot;Revenge&quot; was the second ship to complete her refit and was the flagship of the Home Fleet until 1905. Most of the sisters were placed in reserve after the completion of their refit, although they usually participated in the annual fleet manoeuvres.

&quot;Resolution&quot; was the first ship of the class to be placed in reserve in June 1904. &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;, &quot;Ramillies&quot;, &quot;Repulse&quot;, &quot;Revenge&quot;, &quot;Royal Oak&quot; and &quot;Empress of India&quot; followed in 1905. The latter ship accidentally collided with the submarine the following year. With the exception of &quot;Revenge&quot;, they all were taken out of service in 1909–1912 and &quot;Empress of India&quot; was sunk as a target ship in 1913. &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and &quot;Ramillies&quot; were sold for scrap in October 1913, having been preceded by &quot;Repulse&quot; in July 1911 and followed by &quot;Royal Oak&quot; in January 1914 and &quot;Resolution&quot; in April.

&quot;Hood&quot; served most of her active career with the Mediterranean Fleet, where her low freeboard was less of a disadvantage. The ship was briefly placed in reserve in 1900 and became a guard ship the following year. She returned to the Mediterranean at the end of 1901, but only remained there for a year before returning to Chatham Dockyard for a refit. &quot;Hood&quot; was assigned to the Home Fleet upon its completion in mid-1903 and was reduced to reserve in early 1905. Four years later she became the receiving ship at Queenstown, Ireland. &quot;Hood&quot; was used in the development of anti-torpedo bulges in 1911–1913 and was scuttled in late 1914 to act as a blockship across the southern entrance of Portland Harbour.

&quot;Revenge&quot; was recommissioned in 1906 as a gunnery training ship until she was paid off in 1913. She was recommissioned the following year, after the start of the First World War, to bombard the coast of Flanders as part of the Dover Patrol, during which she was hit four times, but was not seriously damaged. She had anti-torpedo bulges fitted in early 1915, the first ship to be fitted with them operationally. Later that year the ship was renamed &quot;Redoubtable&quot; to release her name for use by the new battleship and was refitted as an accommodation ship by the end of the year. The last surviving member of her class, the ship was sold for scrap in November 1919.

<text>Josip Štolcer-Slavenski (Serbian Cyrillic: Јосип Штолцер-Славенски; 11 May 1896 – 30 November 1955 ) was a Croatian composer and professor at the Music Academy in Belgrade.

British musicologist Jim Samson described Štolcer-Slavenski as &quot;undoubtedly one of a very small handful of truly major composers from South East Europe in the first half of the twentieth century&quot;.

==Life and career==
Josip Štolcer was born in Čakovec in 1896. His father gave him his first instruction in music, then in 1913 he entered the Budapest Conservatory where his teachers included Zoltán Kodály, Albert Siklós, and Béla Bartók. His studies were interrupted in 1916 by army service and at the end of the war he returned to his father&#x27;s bakery business in Čakovec. In 1921 he went to study in Novák&#x27;s masterclasses at the Prague Conservatory. While in Prague, he joined the International Society for Contemporary Music. Having completed his studies in 1923 he returned to Croatia and taught for a year at the music school of the Zagreb Music Academy. At that time, he started to sign his last name as Štolcer-Slavenski, which was both a reflection of his enthusiasm for the Yugoslav idea, and a rejection of his German-sounding last name. In 1924 he moved to Belgrade, where he stayed for the rest of his life (except for a period in 1925–6 spent in Paris); he taught first at the Stanković School of Music, then at the music school of the Belgrade Academy (1937–45), becoming in 1945 professor of composition at the latter. 

Slavenski first attracted attention when in 1920 his orchestral Notturno op.1 was performed in Zagreb; in 1924 his First String Quartet was performed with success at the Donaueschingen Festival. Kleiber conducted his symphony Balkanophonia, first in Berlin in 1927 and then in various musical centres in Europe and the USA. Slavenski thus became the first Yugoslav composer of the 20th century to make an international reputation. At home, however, after the first success in 1920, he had to face the hostility of the then conservative Belgrade public and critics. After 1938 he composed very little; his works were seldom performed between 1940 and 1956 and he was almost forgotten. He died in Belgrade in 1955. It was only after his death that his stature was recognized.

==Work==
Initially Slavenski developed as an autodidact. The rich folk music of his native region, Medjimurje in north-western Croatia, left a decisive impact on him, and his youthful fascination with the sounds of church bells and the intricate combinations of their upper partials greatly contributed towards the formation of his harmonic idiom. His early compositions, dating from the time of his Budapest studies, show a blend of spontaneity with a strong desire for experiment. Polytonality and bold dissonances occurred in his piano pieces as early as 1913, at a time when many southern Slav composers were still treating material borrowed from folk tradition in a predominantly Romantic way. Such interests brought him close to the music of Kodály and Bartók, and his academic studies deepened the mastery of counterpoint, which remained a vital ingredient of his style. He continued to experiment with new ideas throughout the 1920s: the Sonata for violin and organ contains sonorities which foreshadow electronic music, and the Piano Sonata uses aleatory technique. Slavenski&#x27;s interest in folk music broadened in the late 1920s to encompass that of the whole of the Balkans, and the culminating result of this was his Balkanophonia. He was equally attracted by the mystical and ritual aspects of music, as may be seen from Chaos, a movement from the unfinished Heliophonia, and Religiophonia, the latter generally considered to be his masterpiece. During the 1920s and 30s he was one of the very few Yugoslav composers who showed an awareness of the searching spirit of the avant garde abroad. His imaginative use of percussion instruments may occasionally recall Varèse, whose works he did not know. He had no predecessors in Yugoslav music and no followers in his lifetime. When after his death his music became better known, it was already too late for it to exercise a direct influence on Yugoslav composers, though his creative use of folk music and his experiments of the 1920s provided a necessary impulse.

<doc id="467913" wikidata="Q849095" url="?curid=467913" title="List of Canadian federal general elections">
<text>This article provides a summary of results for Canadian general elections (where all seats are contested) to the House of Commons, the elected lower half of Canada&#x27;s federal bicameral legislative body, the Parliament of Canada. The number of seats has increased steadily over time, from 180 for the first election to the current total of 338. The current federal government structure was established in 1867 by the Constitution Act.

For federal by-elections (for one or a few seats as a result of retirement, etc.) see List of federal by-elections in Canada. For the eight general elections of the Province of Canada held in 1843 to 1864 before confederation in 1867, see List of elections in the Province of Canada. There were also earlier elections in Canada, such as for the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada (held in 1792–1836, now part of Ontario) and the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada (held in 1792–1834, now part of Quebec).

Three political parties have dominated politics in Canada: the Liberal Party, the historic Conservative party (known as the Progressive Conservative Party from 1942 to 2003), and the modern Conservative Party are the only parties to have formed a government, although often the Liberals and historic Conservatives have led in a minority or coalition government with one or more smaller parties (the 1917 win was by a pro-conscription Unionist coalition of former Liberals and Conservatives).

Although government has primarily been a two-party system, Canadian federal politics has been a multi-party affair since the 1920s, during which there was significant parliamentary presence of the Progressive Party and the United Farmers movement. They were supplanted by the Social Credit Party and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in the 1930s. The CCF evolved into the New Democratic Party (NDP) in 1961. The Social Credit Party and the CCF/NDP won the third and fourth most seats between them from the 1930s, until the Social Credit Party failed to win any seats in the 1980 election.

Since 1980, the NDP has remained a presence in the Canadian parliament, but the situation amongst other non-government parties has been more complex. The Progressive Conservative Party never recovered from its spectacular defeat in the 1993 election (when it went from being the majority government with 169 seats, to just two seats and the loss of official party status). Right-wing politics has since seen the rise and fall of the Reform Party and the Canadian Alliance, followed by the rise to government of the new Conservative Party. Further, in 1993 the separatist Bloc Québécois won seats for the first time. It has been a constant presence in parliament since then.

==Summary of results==
The third, fourth, and fifth parties&#x27; results are included in &quot;Other&quot; if the party did not win at least four seats in an election at some point in its history. Results for parties placing sixth or lower (as in the 1926 election) are also included in &quot;Other&quot;, as are Independent seats.

After graduation from pilot school, Lonchakov served as a second crew commander, crew commander, squadron senior pilot, and aviation brigade commander in the Russian Navy. Lonchakov has logged over 1400 hours of flight time, is a Class 1 Air Force pilot, and a paratroop training instructor with 526 jumps.

==Cosmonaut career==

Lonchakov was selected as a test-cosmonaut candidate of the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center Cosmonaut Office in December 1997. In July 2004 he took part in the training for survival in extreme situations at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.

=== STS-100 ===
Lonchakov&#x27;s first spaceflight was the Space Shuttle mission STS-100 that installed the International Space Station&#x27;s robotic arm, Canadarm2. Other major objectives for mission were to berth the &quot;Raffaello&quot; logistics module to the station, activate it, transfer cargo between &quot;Raffaello&quot; and the station, and reberth &quot;Raffaello&quot; in the shuttle&#x27;s payload bay. Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center at 18:40:42 UTC on 19 April 2001. Lonchakov served as a mission specialist. After nearly two days of flight, &quot;Endeavour&quot; docked with the ISS on 21 April 2001 at 13:59 UTC. After 8 days of docked operations, the shuttle undocked from the ISS at 17:34 UTC on 19 April. Landing was originally planned at KSC however continuing cloud cover, rain showers and gusty winds forced &quot;Endeavour&quot; to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The mission duration of STS-100 was 11 days, 21 hours, 31 minutes, 14 seconds.

=== Soyuz TMA-1/TM-34 ===
On 25 March 2002, Lonchakov passed training for a spaceflight as the backup crew commander of the Soyuz-TM, Soyuz-TMA spacecraft, 4th visiting crew under the ISS program. On 1 October 2002, he was selected for the prime crew as flight engineer-2 and remained the backup crew commander.

Lonchakov returned to the ISS in October 2002 as a crewmember of the Soyuz taxi flight Soyuz TMA-1. The Soyuz spacecraft carrying commander Lonchakov, flight engineer cosmonaut Sergei Zalyotin and ESA astronaut Frank De Winne lifted off from the Baikonour Cosmodrome on 30 October 2002, at 03:11 UTC. Thick fog on the ground obscured the launch from the cameras, which showed only a silhouette of the rocket and the flame exhaust. The successful docking between the Soyuz TMA-1 and the ISS did take place at 05:01 UTC on 1 November 2002. After spending 10 days, 20 hours and 53 minutes in space Lonchakov returned to Earth on Soyuz TM-34. The Soyuz TM-34 spacecraft, undocked from the nadir port of the &quot;Zarya&quot; module of the ISS on 9 November at 20:44 GMT and landed 100 km north east of Arkalyk on 10 November 2002 at 00:04 UTC. Soyuz TM-34 was the last of the Soyuz-TM spacecraft and was replaced by the Soyuz-TMA.

===Expedition 18===

Lonchakov was originally selected to be a flight engineer on Expedition 19, but was transferred to the Expedition 18 crew as a flight engineer and Soyuz commander, after Salizhan Sharipov was removed from the crew. The Soyuz TMA-13 spacecraft with Lonchakov, Expedition 18 commander Michael Fincke and space tourist Richard Garriott launched on 12 October 2008 at 7:01 UTC. Lonchakov served as the Soyuz commander. After a two-day autonomous flight, Soyuz TMA-13 successfully docked to the Earth-facing docking port of the &quot;Zarya&quot; module of the ISS on 14 October at 08:26 GMT, seven minutes ahead of schedule. Lonchakov joined the ISS Expedition 18 crew as a flight engineer. While Richard Garriott was aboard, Lonchakov participated during his personal time (along with Michael Fincke, Gregory Chamitoff and Richard Garriott) in filming and starring in a science-fiction movie made in space, &quot;Apogee of Fear&quot;.

On 12 March 2009, a piece of debris from the upper stage of a Delta II rocket used to launch a GPS satellite in 1993, passed close to the ISS. The Expedition 18 crew prepared to evacuate the ISS by closing hatches between modules, and boarding the Soyuz spacecraft that was docked to provide emergency crew escape. The debris did not hit the space station and safely passed by at 16:38 UTC, and the crew were cleared to resume operations about five minutes later.

Lonchakov returned to Earth with NASA astronaut Michael Fincke and spaceflight participant Charles Simonyi. The Soyuz TMA-13 capsule landed in Kazakhstan on 8 April 2009, at 7:16 UTC.

=== Spacewalks ===
Lonchakov has performed two career spacewalks totalling 10 hours and 27 minutes.

On 23 December 2008, Lonchakov performed his first career spacewalk with NASA astronaut Michael Fincke. They installed an electromagnetic energy measuring device, (Langmuir probe) on &quot;Pirs&quot;, removed the Russian Biorisk long-duration experiment, installed the Exposing Specimens of Organic and Biological Materials to Open Space (Expose-R) experiment package on &quot;Zvezda&quot;, but subsequently removed it after it failed to activate and transmit telemetry on ground command. The two spacewalkers also installed the Impulse experiment which measures disturbances in the ionosphere around the space station. The EVA was conducted from &quot;Pirs&quot; airlock in Russian Orlan space suits. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 38 minutes.

On 10 March 2009, Lonchakov performed his second career spacewalk, again with Fincke. The two spacewalkers installed the EXPOSE-R experiment onto the universal science platform of the &quot;Zvezda&quot; module, removed tape straps from the area of the docking target on the &quot;Pirs&quot; airlock and docking compartment, inspected and photographed the exterior of the Russian portion of the station. The spacewalk was conducted from &quot;Pirs&quot; Docking Compartment airlock in Russian Orlan space suits. and came to a close at 21:11 UTC when the airlock hatch was closed. The spacewalk lasted 4 hours and 49 minutes and marked the 120th spacewalk in support of space station assembly and maintenance.

=== Resignation ===
In 2013, he submitted his resignation, effective 14 September. It was announced that he was resigning for a more interesting job. Lonchakov had been scheduled to fly on Expedition 44 to the International Space Station, and at the time of announcement, no replacement had been named. Gennady Padalka will be his replacement.

== Post-space career ==
Lonchakov resigned from the cosmonaut corps and took up a position at Gazprom. On 31 March 2014 he was appointed acting head of GCTC.

<text>Sergei Viktorovich Zalyotin (; born April 21, 1962) is a Russian cosmonaut and a veteran of two space missions.

Zalyotin was born in Tula and attended the Borisoglebsk Higher Military School before becoming a fighter pilot in the Russian Air Force. He also holds a degree in ecological management. Zalyotin was selected as a cosmonaut candidate in 1990. In 2000, Zalyotin was a member of the final resident crew aboard the Mir space station. He briefly visited the International Space Station aboard Soyuz TMA-1 in 2002.

==Personal==
Born April 21, 1962, Schekino, Tula Area, RF (Russia). Father: Viktor Dmitrievich Zaletin (1930–1988). Mother: Valentina Ivanovna Zaletina (Prokhorova), born in 1926. Married to Elena Mikhailovna Zaletina (Goriacheva), they have one son.

==Education==
In 1983 he graduated from Borisoglebsk Higher Military Pilot School after V.P. Chkalov and got a diploma of pilot-engineer. In 1994 after tuition by correspondence at the International Center of Training Systems he got a qualification of engineer-ecologist and a degree of Master of ecological management.

==Experience==
In 1983-1990 he served as a pilot, master pilot and flight leader in Air Force units of Moscow military region and in 1990 he was enlisted in the cosmonaut detachment.
From October 1990 to March 1992 he passed a course of general space training at Yu. A. Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center and on March 11, 1992, the qualification of a test-cosmonaut was conferred on him by decision of the Interdepartmental Qualification Committee. In 1992-1997 he passed training under the programme of flights to the Mir Station. From September 1997 to July 1998 he passed training as the backup crew commander under PC-26 programme on the Mir Station.

From October 1998 to March 1999 he was a co-ordinator of Yu. A. Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center at NASA.

In March - May 1999 he passed training as the prime crew commander under PC-28 programme on the Mir Station, however because of the lack of the required financing in June 1999 General Designers&#x27; Review adopted a decision to cancel launch of PC-28 for a time and shift flight the Mir Station into the unmanned flight mode. From June 1999 to March 2000 he passed training as the commander of the prime crew for PC-28.

From April 4 to June 16, 2000, he performed the first space flight as the commander of the Soyuz TM-30 spacecraft and Mir Orbital Complex under PC-28 programme together with A. Kaleri. In the course of operations on the orbital complex the crew carried out the station activation. During the flight he performed one egress into open space with a duration of 5 hours 3 minutes.

<doc id="467917" wikidata="Q5438191" url="?curid=467917" title="Fauna of Belize">
<text>Belize is a country with a rich variety of wildlife, due to its unique position between North and South America, and a wide range of climates and habitats for plant and animal life. Belize&#x27;s low human population, and approximately of undistributed land, provides an ideal home for more than 5000 species of plants, and vast numbers species of animals — with several hundred vertebrates including armadillos, snakes, and monkeys.

== Non-vertebrates ==

The vast majority of Belizean animals are from diverse lineages that are &#x27;non-vertebrates&#x27;, with many arthropods, molluscs, annelida, nematodes and often countless others often poorly studied.

== Vertebrates ==
=== Mammals ===
=== Birds ===
The avifauna of Belize include a total of 590 species, of which two are globally endangered and four have been introduced by humans.

===Amphibians===
There are many species of salamanders, toads, and frogs found in the tropical forests of Belize such as the rufescent salamander, red-eyed tree frog, Maya rain frog, marine toad, and Mexican burrowing toad. Out of 450 species of salamanders found in the world, only six types are found in Belize, all of which belong to the family Plethodontidae. This group of salamanders are the lungless salamanders, meaning they do not breath through lungs, but instead through the pores of their moist skin. There are three species of toads living in Belize, out of more than 300. The largest known toad can be found in Belize, the marine toad. It can grow up to 20 cm (8 in), and weight as much as 1.2 kg (2.5 lb.). These toads are more commonly found in human settlements rather than in the wild, so they are easily seen by tourists. They have adapted to human settlements, so they will eat cat or dog food left out for house pets.

There are more than 800 species of rain frogs that exist, and eight of them are found in Belize. They vary in size, from the Maya rain frog which is about 2.5-3.5 cm (1 in), to the Central American rain frog which can be 9 cm (3.5 in) long. Rain frogs are usually terrestrial, so they can be found on the forest floors, in or near pools, ponds, and streams. They are different from tree frogs in their color; usually having more earth tones with dark markings on their backs and legs. Out of more than 700 species of tree frogs, 12 of them can be found in Belize. Unlike rain frogs, they have more bright colors such as orange, blue, red and yellow to warn predators that they are poisonous. Tree frogs, like their name, are most commonly found in trees. Despite their skinny legs, they are very good jumpers and climbers.

===Reptiles===

In Belize, there are 2 species of crocodilians that roam around the waters, the American crocodile and Morelet&#x27;s crocodile. Although both of these species are not particularly aggressive, they are found as a danger to humans. The American crocodile can grow up to 6.4 m (21 ft), on average being about 4 m (13 ft). They are usually found in the swamps and lowlands of Belize. Morelet&#x27;s crocodile, which is smaller, can grown up to 4 m (13 ft) but the average size is 2.5 m (8 ft). These crocodiles are mostly seen along the coast of Northern and Central Belize in freshwater.

Belize has many species and types of turtles. There are three species of hard-shelled sea turtles such as the loggerhead, which on average is 2.3 m (7.5 ft) long and 540 kg (1190 lb.). They are found in the open oceans and coastal waters of Belize. Another is the green sea turtle which on average is 1.5 m (5 m) and can weigh up to 100 kg (220 lb.). Green sea turtles migrate across open seas but are primarily found in shallow coastal waters. The third type of hard-shelled sea turtle that can be found in Belize is the hawksbill turtle. This sea turtle is only about 1 m (3.3 ft) and does not exceed 50 kg (110 lb.), and they are usually found near coral reefs or rocky areas of the sea. Five species of mud and musk turtles are found in the fresh water bodies of Belize: narrow-bridged musk turtles, Tabasco mud turtles, white-lipped mud turtles, scorpion mud turtles, and Mexican giant musk turtles. Two of the species of turtles that live primarily on land in Belize are the furrowed wood turtle and the slider turtle. Some other species of turtles commonly found in Belize are Central American river turtles which live in fresh water and their average size is about 65 cm (25 in), and snapping turtles which can tolerate any type of body of water, and on average are about 47 cm (18 in).

Belize is home to many tropical snake species, including both venomous and nonvenomous snakes. The families found in Belize consist of Colubridae, Boidae, Elapidae and Viperidae, of which the latter two families are highly venomous and may present a potential health hazard to humans if provoked. Out of 1500 species of colubrids known, 60 of these species live in the tropical habitats of Belize. Many of the colubrid species found in Belize are often Neotropical forms of the Neartic colubrids found in Mexico, the United States, and Canada, with some of the species of colubrid snakes consisting of the water snakes, brown snakes, garter snakes, whip snakes, green snakes, rat snakes, and king snakes.

Colubrid snakes differ from other Belize snakes in a few ways. Colubrids typically do not have a definable jaw line, and often have heads that are not much thicker than the neck, if at all. In addition, they have several rows of teeth on the roof of their mouth, as well as single row of teeth on the bottom jaw, but they do not have elongated, hollow fangs in the upper jaw as some of the venomous snakes often do. The only species in the family Boidae that is found in Belize is the boa constrictor, which includes a separate locality form (potentially a separate subspecies) from Crawl Cay. A dwarf form, Belizean boa constrictors can reach up to a maximum length of but typically only reach a length of . Their patterns typically consists of brown or black squarish markings on a grey or brown background that become progressively rounder, larger, and darker towards the tail, and this pattern helps them to camouflage in their surroundings, often in leaf litter, bushes, and tree canopies, to remain hidden from both prey and predators.

Boa constrictors and many of the colubrid species kill their prey primarily via constriction, grabbing their prey within their jaws before throwing coils of their muscular bodies around the prey item and squeezing a great amount of pressure, killing their prey by asphyxiation and ruptured blood capillaries. Boa constrictors are ambush hunters, while colubrids will vary between being either active hunters or ambush hunters.

The venomous snakes in Belize can be split into two families: the Viperidae, and the Elapidae. The Viperidae of Belize contains pit vipers such as rattlesnakes, lanceheads, and the cantils. Most of the venomous snakes in Belize are in this family. Some of the specific species found in Belize are the fer-de-lance, (&quot;Bothrops asper&quot;) which can grow up to 2.5 m (8 ft) in length, the eyelash viper (&quot;Bothriechis shlegelii&quot;), which can grow up to 1 m (3 ft), and the Neotropical rattlesnake (&quot;Crotalus durissus&quot;), with can reach a length of 1.5 m (5 ft).

Both pit vipers (which are venomous) and boa constrictors (which are not) are usually ambush hunters that will remain hidden, laying in wait in a single general area, potentially up for several days, before striking a prey item that crosses their path with immense speed. There are only 3 species of the family Elapidae that are found in Belize, all of which are classified as different species of coral snakes. Coral snakes are often found in bright vivid patterns which represent a warning to potential predators or aggravators, also of which are known to be mimicked by the colubriod milk snakes as a form of Batesian mimicry. Coral snakes from Belize are typically small, rarely ever grow longer than 1 m (3 ft). However, their venom is known to be a very powerful neurotoxin.

There are eight species of geckos that inhabit Belize. They are very small, harmless lizards, that can climb walls due to their big toes and claws that allow them to cling easily. This is why they are often found in homes of people in Belize, hanging on the walls. They are usually a length of 5–10 cm (2–4 in), not including the tail. The size of the tail can vary dramatically because of the gecko&#x27;s ability to detach it and grow another. There is one species of gecko that can only be found in Belize, which is the Belize leaf-toed gecko. The world&#x27;s smallest reptile, the Caribbean dwarf gecko, which on average is 4 cm (1.5 in) long, has also made its home in Belize.

<text>Medical software is any software item or system used within a medical context. This can include:

* Standalone software used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.
* Software used by health care providers to reduce paperwork and offer digital services to patients, e.g., a patient portal.
* Software embedded in a medical device (often referred to as &quot;medical device software&quot;).
* Software that drives a medical device or determines how it is used.
* Software that acts as an accessory to a medical device.
* Software used in the design, production, and testing of a medical device (or)
* Software that provides quality control management of a medical device.

==History==
Medical software has been in use since at least since the 1960s, a time when the first computerized information-handling system in the hospital sphere was being considered by Lockheed. As computing became more widespread and useful in the late 1970s and 1980s, the concept of &quot;medical software&quot; as a data and operations management tool in the medical industry—including in the physician&#x27;s office—became more prevalent. Medical software became more prominent in medical devices in fields such as nuclear medicine, cardiology, and medical robotics by the early 1990s, prompting additional scrutiny of the &quot;safety-critical&quot; nature of medical software in the research and legislative communities, in part fueled by the Therac-25 radiation therapy device scandal.

The development of the ISO 9000-3 standard as well as the European Medical Devices Directive in 1993 helped bring some harmonization of existing laws with medical devices and their associated software, and the addition of IEC 62304 in 2006 further cemented how medical device software should be developed and tested. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also offered guidance and driven regulation on medical software, particularly embedded in and used as medical devices. There was an expansion of medical software innovation with the adoption of electronic health records (EHR) and availability of electronic clinical data. In the United States, substantial resources were allocated, starting with the HITECH Act of 2009. 

==Medical device software==
The global IEC 62304 standard on the software life cycle processes of medical device software states it is a &quot;software system that has been developed for the purpose of being incorporated into the medical device being developed or that is intended for use as a medical device in its own right.&quot; In the U.S., the FDA states that &quot;any software that meets the legal definition of a [medical] device&quot; is considered medical device software. A similar &quot;software can be a medical device&quot; interpretation was also made by the European Union in 2007 with an update to its European Medical Devices Directive, when &quot;used specifically for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;2007/47/EC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the broad scope covered by these terms, manifold classifications can be proposed for various medical software, based for instance on their technical nature (embedded in a device or standalone), on their level of safety (from the most trivial to the most safety-critical ones), or on their primary function (treatment, education, diagnostics, and/or data management).

A key distinction in medical software classification is between Software in a Medical Device (SiMD)and Software as a Medical Device (SaMD). SiMD refers to software that is essential for a medical device to function, such as control software for robotic surgical systems or firmware in diagnostic instruments. SaMD, on the other hand, operates independently of a hardware device and is designed to fulfill a medical purpose on its own.

===Software as a medical device===
The dramatic increase in smartphone usage in the twenty-first century triggered the emergence of thousands of standalone health- and medical-related software apps, many falling into a gray or borderline area in terms of regulation. While software embedded into a medical device was being addressed, medical software separate from medical hardware—referred to by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) as &quot;software as a medical device&quot; or &quot;SaMD&quot;—was falling through existing regulatory cracks.

In the U.S., the FDA eventually released new draft guidance in July 2011 on &quot;mobile medical applications,&quot; with members of the legal community, such as Keith Barritt, speculating it should be read to imply &quot;as applicable to all software, since the test for determining whether a mobile application is a regulated mobile &#x27;medical&#x27; application is the same test one would use to determine if any software is regulated.&quot; Examples of mobile apps potentially covered by the guidance included those that regulate an installed pacemaker or those that analyze images for cancerous lesions, X-rays and MRI, graphic data such as EEG waveforms as well as bedside monitors, urine analyzers, glucometer, stethoscopes, spirometers, BMI calculators, heart rate monitors, and body fat calculators.

By the time its final guidance was released in late 2013, however, members of Congress began to be concerned about how the guidance would be used in the future, in particular with what it would mean to the SOFTWARE Act legislation that had recently been introduced. Around the same time, the IMDRF was working on a more global perspective of SaMD with the release of its Key Definitions in December 2013, focused on &quot;[establishing] a common framework for regulators to incorporate converged controls into their regulatory approaches for SaMD.&quot; Aside from &quot;not [being] necessary for a hardware medical device to achieve its intended medical purpose,&quot; the IMDRF also found that SaMD also could not drive a medical device, though it could be used as a module of or interfaced with one. The group further developed quality management system principles for SaMD in 2015.

=== Software in a medical device ===
Software in a medical device (SiMD) refers to software that is integral to the operation of a physical medical device. Unlike SaMD, which functions independently, SiMD is embedded within or necessary for the device&#x27;s intended medical purpose. Examples include software that controls an artificial cardiac pacemaker, manages infusion pumps, or operates imaging systems like MRI machines.

The development and maintenance of SiMD are governed by international standards to ensure safety and efficacy. IEC 62304:2006 outlines the life cycle requirements for medical device software, establishing a framework for processes, activities, and tasks throughout the software&#x27;s life cycle. Additionally, ISO 13485:2016 specifies requirements for a quality management system in the design and manufacture of medical devices, including software components.

==International standards==
IEC 62304 has become the benchmark standard for the development of medical device software, standalone or otherwise, in both the E.U. and the U.S. Innovation in software technologies has led key industry leaders and government regulators to recognize the emergence of numerous standalone medical software products that operate as medical devices. This has been reflected in regulatory changes in the E.U. (European Medical Devices Directive) and the U.S. (various FDA guidance documents). Additionally, quality management system requirements for manufacturing a software medical device, as is the case with any medical device, are described in the U.S. Quality Systems Regulation of the FDA and also in ISO 13485:2016.

Software technology manufacturers that operate within the software medical device space conduct mandatory development of their products in accordance with those requirements. Furthermore, though not mandatory, they may elect to obtain certification from a notified body, having implemented such quality system requirements as described within international standards such as ISO 13485:2016.

<doc id="467924" wikidata="Q1082328" url="?curid=467924" title="Oxisol">
<text>Oxisols are a soil order in USDA soil taxonomy, best known for their occurrence in tropical rain forest within 25 degrees north and south of the Equator. In the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB), they belong mainly to the ferralsols, but some are plinthosols or nitisols. Some oxisols have been previously classified as laterite soils.

==Formation==
The main processes of soil formation of oxisols are weathering, humification and pedoturbation due to animals. These processes produce the characteristic soil profile. They are defined as soils containing &quot;at all depths&quot; no more than ten percent weatherable minerals, and low cation exchange capacity. Oxisols are always a red or yellowish color, due to the high concentration of iron(III) and aluminium oxides and hydroxides. They also contain quartz and kaolin, plus small amounts of other clay minerals and organic matter.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;oxisol&quot; comes from &quot;oxide&quot; in reference to the dominance of oxide minerals such as bauxite. In the World Reference Base for Soil Resources, oxisols are known as &quot;ferralsols&quot;.

==Occurrence==
Present-day oxisols are found almost exclusively in tropical areas, in South America and Africa, almost always on highly stable continental cratons.

In Southeast Asia, oxisols are found on remnants of the Cimmerian microcontinent, and on the Shan–Thai terrane. In Thailand, rhodic ferralsols, called Yasothon soils, are said to have formed under humid tropical conditions in the early Tertiary, on an extensive plain later uplifted to form the Khorat Plateau. Characterized by a bright red color, these relict soils occur on uplands in a great semicircle around the southern rim, overlying associated gravel horizons said to have been cleared of sand by termites, in a prolonged and still on-going process of bioturbation. Xanthic ferralsols of the Khorat and Udon series, characterized by a pale yellow to brown color, developed in midlands in processes still under investigation; as are those forming lowland soils resembling European brown soils.

In Australia vast areas formerly covered in rainforest have become so dry that oxisols have formed a hard ironstone cover upon which only skeletal soils can form.

==Genesis==
Fossil oxisols are known from the first appearance of free oxygen in the atmosphere about 2,200 million years ago. In warm periods like the Mesozoic and Paleocene, oxisols extended to areas that now have quite cool climates, extending well into North America and Europe. It is believed oxisols became vegetated later than ultisols or alfisols, probably because vegetation took a long time to adapt to the infertility of oxisols.

==History==
Scientists originally thought that the heavy vegetation of tropical rain forests would provide rich nutrients, but as rainfall passes through the litter on the forest floor the rain is acidified and leaches minerals from the above soil layers. This forces plants to get their nutrition from decaying litter as oxisols are quite infertile due to the lack of organic matter and the almost complete absence of soluble minerals leached by the wet and humid climate.

==Uses==
Oxisols are often used for tropical crops such as cocoa and rubber. In some cases, rice is grown on them. Permanent cropping of oxisols in low-income areas is very difficult because of low cation exchange capacities and high phosphorus fixation on iron and aluminium oxides (ligand exchange mechanism; inner sphere complex with phosphate). However, many oxisols can be cultivated over a wide range of moisture conditions. On this account, oxisols are intensively exploited for agriculture in some regions which have enough wealth to support modern agricultural practices (including regular additions of lime and fertilizer). A recent example of exploitation by modern methods involves the growing of soybeans in Brazil.

==Suborders==
Oxisols are divided into the following suborders:
* Aquox – oxisols with a water table at or near the surface for much of the year
* Perox – oxisols of continuously humid climates, where precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration in all months
* Torrox – oxisols of arid climates. Because the present climate can never produce enough weathering to produce oxisols, torrox soils are always paleosols formed during periods of much wetter climates. They occur mainly in Southern Africa.
* Ustox – oxisols of semiarid and subhumid climates
* Udox – oxisols of humid climates
