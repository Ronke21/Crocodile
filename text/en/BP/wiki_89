<text>Shapinsay (, ) is one of the Orkney Islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. With an area of , it is the eighth largest island in the Orkney archipelago. It is low-lying and, with a bedrock formed from Old Red Sandstone overlain by boulder clay, fertile, causing most of the area to be used for farming. Shapinsay has two nature reserves and is notable for its bird life. Balfour Castle, built in the Scottish Baronial style, is one of the island&#x27;s most prominent features, a reminder of the Balfour family&#x27;s domination of Shapinsay during the 18th and 19th centuries; the Balfours transformed life on the island by introducing new agricultural techniques. Other landmarks include a standing stone, an Iron Age broch, a souterrain and a salt-water shower.

There is one village on the island, Balfour, from which roll-on/roll-off car ferries sail to Kirkwall on the Orkney Mainland. At the 2011 census, Shapinsay had a population of 307. The economy of the island is primarily based on agriculture with the exception of a few small businesses that are largely tourism-related. A community-owned wind turbine was constructed in 2011. The island has a primary school but, in part due to improving transport links with mainland Orkney, no longer has a secondary school. Shapinsay&#x27;s long history has given rise to various folk tales.

== Etymology ==
Unlike most of the larger Orkney islands, the derivation of the name &#x27;Shapinsay&#x27; is not obvious. The final &#x27;ay&#x27; is from the Old Norse for &quot;island&quot;, but the first two syllables are more difficult to interpret. Haswell-Smith suggests the root may be &quot;hjalpandis-øy&quot; (&quot;helpful island&quot;) owing to the presence of a good harbour, although anchorages are plentiful in the archipelago. The first written record dates from 1375 in a reference to &quot;Scalpandisay&quot;, which may suggest a derivation from &quot;Judge&#x27;s island&quot;. Another suggestion is &quot;Hyalpandi&#x27;s island&quot;, although no one of that name is known to be associated with Shapinsay. Blaeu&#x27;s 1654 &quot;Atlas Novus&quot; includes a map of the island and names it &quot;Siapansa Oy&quot;, but the descriptive text lists it as &quot;Shapinsa&quot;.

== History ==
=== Early history ===

Standing stones show evidence of the island&#x27;s human occupation since Neolithic times. According to Tacitus, the Roman general Agricola subdued the inhabitants of the Orkney Islands, and a local legend holds that he landed on Shapinsay. During the 18th century, a croft named &quot;Grukalty&quot; was renamed &quot;Agricola&quot; (which is also Latin for &quot;farmer&quot;). Roman coins have been found on Shapinsay, but they may have been brought to the island by traders.

Shapinsay is mentioned in the Norse sagas: &quot;The Saga of Haakon Haakonsson&quot; states that Haakon IV of Norway anchored in Elwick Bay before sailing south to eventual defeat at the Battle of Largs.
&quot;Atlas Novus&quot; included a map and various descriptions of the island. The harbour at Elwick is described as &quot;quite commodious&quot;, and the dwelling of &quot;Sound&quot; is praised. The estate of Sound, which covered the western part of the island, had passed from the Tulloch family to the Buchanan family in 1627. John Buchanan was a royal servant and his wife Margaret Hartsyde was from a Kirkwall family. In 1674, Arthur Buchanan built the new house of Sound, which was situated 250 metres west of where Balfour Castle now stands. The atlas’s description of Orkney by Walter Stewart then goes on to note that Shapinsay had one minister at the time.

=== 18th century ===

The 18th century saw the beginnings of change to agriculture on Shapinsay, courtesy of the Balfour family. Arthur Buchanan’s granddaughter married James Fea, who supported the Jacobite rising of 1715; his house was burned by Hanoverian troops in revenge. The estate was acquired by Andrew Ross, Stewart Depute in Orkney of the Earl of Morton and Ross&#x27;s heirs, the Lindsay brothers, sold the estate to Thomas Balfour in 1782. Balfour had previously rented the Bu of Burray, a large manor farm on another Orkney island, but had insufficient wealth to acquire the estate even though his wife received a large inheritance from her brother. To raise the necessary funds of £1,250, Balfour sold his military commission and borrowed from his brother. Once installed on the island, Balfour built a new house, Cliffdale, and founded the village of Shoreside, now known as Balfour. He also reformed the local agriculture, enclosing fields and constructing farm buildings.

The last person to be executed in Orkney was Marjory Meason, a native of Shapinsay, in 1728. She was a young servant who was hanged in Kirkwall for the murder of a child. The execution is recorded as requiring 24 armed men, not including officers, and costing £15 8s.

During this period, burning kelp was a mainstay of the island economy. More than of burned seaweed were produced per annum to make soda ash, bringing in £20,000 for the inhabitants. Thomas Balfour&#x27;s income from the kelp industry brought him four times the income that farming did.

=== 19th century ===
The 19th century saw radical change in Shapinsay. Thomas Balfour&#x27;s grandson, David Balfour, transformed the island after inheriting the family estate, which by 1846 encompassed the whole of Shapinsay. Most of the land was divided into fields of , a feature still apparent today. Tenants were required to enclose and drain the land or pay for the estate to do it in the form of a surcharge added to their rents. In 1846, on Shapinsay consisted of arable land. By 1860, that had trebled to more than . New crops and breeds of cattle and sheep were also introduced. Balfour&#x27;s reforms were described as &quot;the fountain and origin&quot; of Orkney improvement.

Thomas Balfour had enemies amongst the Orkney establishment, and one of them described his attempts in disparaging language. Thomson notes that the wholesale clearance of cottars from their land and re-settlement in the planned village turned them into estate employees, which may not have been seen by them as a &quot;change for the better&quot;. The process by which his son David came to own the whole island was also part of a controversial process of enclosure. At the beginning of the 19th century, 45% of all Orkney and fully 2,956 acres of Shapinsay was common land. Today, only 624 acres of commons remains throughout Orkney. This process of clearance and enclosure, common throughout Scotland at this time, was accompanied by an estrangement between landowner and tenants. For example, Thomas Balfour went to the grammar school in Kirkwall as had his father before him, but two of his sons were educated at the prestigious Harrow School in southern England. The power of the landowners is suggested by an incident during his grandson David&#x27;s period of ownership. Various church elders complained about what they considered to be immoral behaviour at a social event (men were allowed to dance with women) so Balfour had them evicted from the island.

David Balfour also gave the island its most noticeable landmark when he recruited an Edinburgh architect, David Bryce, to transform Cliffdale House into the Scottish Baronial Balfour Castle. Other buildings he added to the island include the porter&#x27;s lodge (now a public house called The Gatehouse), a water mill, a school, and a gasworks that remained operational until the 1920s. The gasworks is in the form of a round tower with a corbelled parapet of red brick and carved stones—including one possibly removed from Noltland Castle on Westray, which is inscribed with the year 1725. The structure appears to be fortified, in accordance with Balfour&#x27;s intention to give the village a medieval appearance. David Balfour was also responsible for the construction of Mill Dam, a wetland which was once the water supply for the mill and is now an RSPB nature reserve.

Fishing for herring and cod grew in importance during the 19th century. Herring fishing was expanding generally in Scotland at that time, with fishing stations being set up in remote areas. Herring fishing began in 1814 on Stronsay and soon spread throughout the Orkney Islands. By the middle of the century, Shapinsay had 50 herring boats. Cod became important largely because the Napoleonic Wars forced English fishing boats to fish further north. Local fishermen, who had been catching fish using lines from small boats for centuries, began trawling for cod, though fishing was largely a part-time venture. Helliar Holm&#x27;s beaches were used to dry both herring and cod after they had been salted. With the end of the Napoleonic Wars, which led to cheaper sources of soda ash becoming available from continental Europe, the kelp industry collapsed by 1830. This collapse fueled agricultural reform, as crofters accustomed to earning a second income had to now earn more from farming.

=== 20th century ===
Orkney was a strategic site during both World Wars. In 1917, during the First World War, the &quot;Swiftsure&quot; was hit by a mine 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) east of Haco&#x27;s Ness and sank in 19 metres (62 ft) of water with the loss of a single life. The site of the wreck was not discovered until 1997.

The Balfour estate sold its farms on Shapinsay between 1924 and 1928. This was a common occurrence in Orkney at the time as wealthy landowners moved to more lucrative forms of investment. Farms were generally sold to the sitting tenant or to their neighbours who wished to expand.

During the Second World War, gun batteries were built on the island. A twin six pounder emplacement at Galtness Battery on the coast at Salt Ness protected the Wide Firth from German torpedo boats. A Castle Battery was operational from 1941 to 1943, as was an anti-aircraft battery. 

Mechanised implements came to the island, particularly after the Second World War, and the amount of land given over to growing grass increased. The growing of grain (with the exception of barley) and turnips steadily declined as these were replaced as winter fodder for livestock by silage, usually harvested by mechanical forage harvesters. The trend towards more intensive farming began to be partially reversed by the end of the century as more environmentally friendly practices were encouraged by government and European Union grants. Some of the land is managed under a Habitat Creation Scheme, which aims to encourage natural vegetation, wild flowers and nesting birds by limiting grazing and reducing the use of chemical fertilisers.

Mains electricity arrived on Shapinsay in the 1970s, when an underwater cable was laid from Kirkwall. Tourism became important in the latter half of the century; the first restaurant to incorporate bed and breakfast facilities opened in 1980. Before 1995, the island had a secondary school but lost this because of falling enrolment and improved transport links with Kirkwall, to where Shapinsay secondary pupils now travel. The shorter ferry crossing times enabled Shapinsay residents to work in Kirkwall, making it a &quot;commuter isle&quot;.

== Geography ==

With an area of , Shapinsay is the 8th largest Orkney island and the 29th largest Scottish island. The highest point of Ward Hill is above sea level. The east coast is composed of low cliffs and has several sea caves, including the geo at the extreme northern tip known as Geo of Ork. Elwick Bay is a sheltered anchorage on the south coast, facing the Orkney mainland; the island&#x27;s largest settlement, Balfour, is at the western end of the bay. When seen from the air Shapinsay’s square ten-acre fields and straight roads are an obvious feature of the landscape. These are the result of David Balfour’s 19th century &quot;improvments&quot;.

The island has several ayres, or storm beaches, which form narrow spits of shingle or sand cutting across the landward and seaward ends of shallow bays. They can sometimes cut off a body of water from the sea, forming shallow freshwater lochs known as oyces. Examples include Vasa Loch and Lairo Water.

There are several small islands in the vicinity including Broad Shoal, Grass Holm and Skerry of Vasa. Helliar Holm is a tidal islet at the eastern entrance to the main harbour at Balfour; it has a small lighthouse and a ruined broch. The String, a stretch of water that lies between Helliar Holm and the mainland, has strong tidal currents.
Shapinsay has a bedrock formed from Old Red Sandstone, which is approximately 400 million years old and was laid down in the Devonian period. These thick deposits accumulated as earlier Silurian rocks, uplifted by the formation of Pangaea, eroded and then deposited into river deltas. The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of these eroding mountains, stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth. The composition of Shapinsay is mostly of the Rousay flagstone group from the Lower Middle Devonian, with some Eday flagstone in the southeast formed in wetter conditions during the later Upper Devonian. The latter is regarded as a better quality building material than the former. At Haco&#x27;s Ness in the south east corner of the island is a small outcrop of amygdaloidal diabase. The island is overlain with a fertile layer of boulder clay formed during the Pleistocene glaciations.

== Flora and fauna ==

The island&#x27;s bird life is rich in waders such as curlew and redshank, found at The Ouse and Veantro Bay, and gull and tern colonies on the rockier shores and cliffs. Pintail, shovelers and whooper swans are regular summer visitors, and there are breeding populations of shelducks, hen harriers and Arctic skuas. There is an introduced population of red-legged partridges. Otters can be seen at the Ouse, Lairo Water and Vasa Loch, and at various places around the coast along with common seals and Atlantic grey seals. The island has a RSPB reserve at Mill Dam and a Scottish Wildlife Trust reserve at Holm of Burghlee in the southeast. Mill Dam is home to the great yellow bumblebee, one of the rarest bumblebees in the UK.

Shapinsay has very few stands of trees. The two largest are on the grounds of Balfour Castle and the southwest shore of Loch of Westhill to the north. The coastlines of Orkney’s islands, including Shapinsay, are well-known for their abundant and colourful spring and summer flowers including sea aster, sea squill, sea thrift, common sea-lavender, bell and common heather. The lichen &quot;Melaspilea interjecta&quot;, which is endemic to Scotland, is found in only three locations, including Shapinsay. 
== Demography ==
The highest recorded population for Shapinsay is 974, in 1881. Since then, the population of the island has steadily declined; less than a third of that number was recorded in the 2001 census. The rate of absolute population loss was lower in the last decades of the 20th century than it had been in the first half of that century. In 2001, Shapinsay had a population of 300, a decline of 6.8% from 322 in 1991. This was greater than the population decline for Orkney overall in the same period, which was 1.9%. However, the loss in population on Shapinsay was less than that experienced by most Orkney islands, most of which experienced declines of more than 10%. The number of persons per hectare on Shapinsay was 0.1, similar to the 0.2 persons per hectare across Orkney. At the time of the 2011 census the usually resident population had increased to 307. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.

Of the island&#x27;s 300 inhabitants recorded in 2001, 283 were born in the United Kingdom (227 in Scotland and 56 in England). Seventeen were born outside the United Kingdom (four elsewhere in Europe, four in Asia, four in North America, one in South America and four in Oceania). By age group, 85 of the inhabitants were under 30 years of age, 134 were aged between 30 and 59, and 71 were age 60 and over.

== Notable buildings ==

Balfour Castle dominates views of the southwest of the island and can be seen from the tower of St. Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall. The castle library features a secret passage hidden behind a false set of bookshelves. The Balfours escaped unwelcome visitors through this passageway, which leads to the conservatory door. Another feature of the castle is the stags&#x27; heads with gaslights at the tips of their antlers, although these are no longer used as working lights. The castle grounds feature deciduous woodland (now rare in Orkney) and of walled gardens. Though built around an older structure that dates at least from the 18th century, the present castle was built in 1847, commissioned by Colonel David Balfour, and designed by Edinburgh architect David Bryce.

Other buildings constructed by David Balfour include the Dishan Tower, known locally as &quot;The Douche&quot;. This is a saltwater shower building with a dovecote on top. A local landmark due to its high visibility when approaching the island by sea, the building is now in a serious state of disrepair, the roof having collapsed.
A more ancient dwelling on Shapinsay is the Iron Age Broch of Burroughston. David Balfour arranged for the site to be excavated by the archaeologists George Petrie and Sir William Dryden in 1861. The site was neglected after the excavation, slowly filling up with vegetation and rubble before being cleared in 1994. Only the interior of this partially buried building has been excavated, allowing visitors to look down into the broch from the surrounding mound. The surviving drystone walls rise to about three metres (10 ft) and are more than four metres (13 ft) thick in some places.

Shapinsay Heritage Centre is located in Balfour&#x27;s former smithy, along with a craft shop and a cafe. The castle&#x27;s former gatehouse is now the village public house.

== Economy ==
In common with the other Orkney islands, Shapinsay is fertile agricultural land, with farms specialising in beef and lamb which export thousands of cattle and sheep annually. Shapinsay has an active agricultural association which hosts an annual agricultural show, as well as other regular events.

The Shapinsay development trust has created a community plan for the island and owns a wind turbine, which was erected in August 2011 after the community voted for its construction. According to the development trust, the turbine could earn more than £5 million during its 25-year lifetime. In 2022–23 Shapinsay Renewables Ltd., which operates the wind turbine, made a gift aid payment of just under £134,000 to the development trust. In both 2022 and 2023 the Development Trust received funding to develop affordable rental housing on the island and in 2023 they also opened a newly refurbished heritage centre and cafe.

Small businesses on Shapinsay include a jam and chutney manufacturer, which uses traditional methods. Balfour Castle was run as a hotel by the family of Captain Tadeusz Zawadzki, a Polish cavalry officer, but is now in use as a private house. There is a salmon fish farm off Shapinsay.

===Transport===
Orkney Ferries provides transport for pedestrians and vehicles, proximity to Kirkwall permitting closer contacts with the Orkney Mainland than is possible for most of the other North Isles. There are six crossings per day, the journey lasting about 25 minutes. Between 1893 and 1964, the island was served by the steamer &quot;Iona&quot; which was originally owned by John Reid and purchased by William Dennison in 1914. After 1964, the converted trawler &quot;Klydon&quot;
 and then the &quot;Clytus&quot;, an ex Clyde pilot vessel operated by the government-owned Orkney Islands Shipping Company ran on this service. The current ferry is the which docks at the slipway at Balfour on arrival. Orkney is to trial two electric ferries after Artemis Technologies, based in Belfast, were awarded more than £15m of funding by the UK government&#x27;s Zero Emission Vessels and Infrastructure Fund in 2023. One of the vessels will ferry passengers from Kirkwall, to Shapinsay and the nearby islands of Rousay, Egilsay and Wyre. The Orkney Islands Council has also considered building a tunnel to the Orkney Mainland.
The development trust offers electric bicycles for hire and operates 3 electric vehicles which are available to residents, community groups on the island and visitors.

== Education and culture ==
Shapinsay has a primary school, which in the 2022–23 academic year had 23 pupils. The school doubles as a community centre and is host to a learning centre supported by the UHI Millennium Institute. This centre uses the internet, email and video-conferencing to allow students in Shapinsay to study without leaving the island.

In December 2006, the pupils staged a joint Christmas show with a school in Grinder, Norway, from Shapinsay. The schools used the internet to collaborate, supported by BT Group (BT), which upgraded the school&#x27;s broadband connection. The finale of the show involved the Norwegian pupils singing &quot;Away in a Manger&quot; in English while the Shapinsay pupils responded with &quot;En Stjerne Skinner I Natt&quot; in Norwegian. This multilingual collaboration was somewhat easier for the Grinder pupils, who are taught English from the age of six. This collaboration was part of an ongoing relationship between the schools, whose children exchange letters and cards. Shapinsay school&#x27;s headteacher has visited the Norwegian school, and there are plans for a reciprocal visit in 2008.

Shapinsay Community School has gained a Silver Award under the international Eco-Schools programme. School pupils have carried out an energy audit, helped to plant more than 600 trees close to the school and carried out energy saving campaigns. Shapinsay pupils have also won an award from the Scottish Crofters Commission for producing a booklet on crofting on the island.

== Folklore ==
Cubbie Roo, the best known Orcadian giant, has a presence on Shapinsay. He was originally based on the historical figure Kolbein Hrúga, who built Cubbie Roo&#x27;s Castle in 1150 on the isle of Wyre, which is possibly the oldest castle in Scotland, and was mentioned in the &quot;Orkneyinga Saga&quot;. The figure Cubbie Roo has departed far from his historical origins and has become a giant in the fashion that Finn MacCool (legendary builder of the Giant&#x27;s Causeway) has in parts of Scotland and Ireland. He is said to have lived on the island of Wyre and used Orkney&#x27;s islands as stepping stones. Many large stones on Orkney islands, including Shapinsay, are said to have been thrown or left there by the giant. Cubbie Roo&#x27;s Burn is a waterway on Shapinsay that flows through a channel called &quot;Trolldgeo&quot;. Cubbie Roo&#x27;s Lade is a pile of stones on the shore near Rothiesholm Head, the westmost point of Stronsay. This is supposedly the beginning of a bridge between the two islands that the giant had failed to complete. The name derives from the Old Norse &quot;trolla-hlad&quot;, meaning &quot;giant&#x27;s causeway&quot;.

In 1905, &quot;The Orcadian&quot; newspaper reported that a strange creature had been seen off the coast of Shapinsay. It was reportedly the size of a horse, with a spotted body covered in scales. Opinion on the creature&#x27;s origin was divided, with some islanders believing it to be a sea serpent, while others opined that it was merely a large seal.

<text>Martin Stanford Peters (8 November 1943 – 21 December 2019) was an English footballer and manager. As a member of the England team which won the 1966 FIFA World Cup, he scored the second of England&#x27;s four goals in the final against West Germany. He also played in the 1970 FIFA World Cup. Born in Plaistow, Essex, he played club football for West Ham United, Tottenham Hotspur, Norwich City and Sheffield United. He briefly managed Sheffield United before retiring from professional football in 1981.

Peters was known as &quot;the complete midfielder&quot; as he could pass the ball well with either foot, was good in the air and difficult to mark because of his movement. A free kick specialist, he was described by England manager Sir Alf Ramsey, after a game against Scotland in 1968, as being &quot;ten years ahead of his time&quot;. His versatility was such that while he was at West Ham he played in every position in the team, including goalkeeper in his third game, replacing an injured Brian Rhodes. With his transfer from West Ham United to Tottenham Hotspur in 1970, he became Britain&#x27;s first £200,000 footballer.

==Early years==
Peters was born in Egham Road, off Beckton Road in Plaistow, Essex, on Monday 8 November 1943 during the Second World War. His father, William Peters, was a Thames Lighterman. Shortly after Peters&#x27; birth, he was evacuated with his mother to Shropshire to avoid the bombing of London by the Luftwaffe. When he was seven his family moved to Dagenham, where he attended the local Fanshawe School. In schoolboy football, he played mostly as a centre-half but often as a full-back. He came to the attention of Fulham, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea. Peters did not support any club as a schoolboy and favoured joining Chelsea as his friend Terry Venables, whom he had met playing for Dagenham Schoolboys, had signed for Chelsea. After playing for England schoolboys he was scouted by Wally St Pier for West Ham United. In the summer of 1959 he was signed as a 15-year-old apprentice by West Ham.

==Club career==
===West Ham United===

Peters signed his first professional contract in November 1960. His first manager Ted Fenton left the club in 1961, to be replaced by Ron Greenwood. He was a major influence on Peters and his progress as a young footballer. In his first years with West Ham, Peters had played in both defensive and midfield positions before Fenton had encouraged him to play as a right-half. He made his debut on Good Friday 1962 in a 4–1 home win against Cardiff City. He scored his first goal for West Ham in a 6–1 win at Manchester City on 8 September 1962. Also in 1962, Peters played in goal for West Ham in a game against Cardiff after regular goalkeeper, Brian Rhodes had been injured.

Peters played only five games in his first season with West Ham. Although he played 32 league games in the 1963–64 season, he played no part in their FA Cup run and was not selected for the FA Cup final of 1964 at Wembley, in which they beat Preston North End 3–2. The following year, however, he established himself as a first team regular and was victorious at Wembley when West Ham won the European Cup Winners Cup with victory over 1860 Munich. He was usually partnered in midfield by Eddie Bovington and Ronnie Boyce.

Peters began to impose himself on West Ham&#x27;s game, and another chance for silverware came in 1966 when West Ham reached the League Cup final. The occasion was still over two-legs with each of the finalists hosting a leg (though this changed to a one-off final at Wembley a year later), and Peters played in both matches. He scored in the second game but opponents West Bromwich Albion emerged as 5–3 winners on aggregate. The 1968–69 season saw Peters&#x27; only hat-trick for West Ham, in a 4–0 home defeat of West Bromwich Albion. That was also his most prolific season: 24 goals came for him from 48 games.

===Tottenham Hotspur===

Feeling he was in the shadows of Bobby Moore and Geoff Hurst, Peters sought a new challenge. In March 1970, West Ham received a record-breaking £200,000 (£150,000 cash) for Peters from Tottenham Hotspur and he moved to White Hart Lane, with Spurs and England striker Jimmy Greaves (valued at £50,000) going the other way. On 21 March 1970, Peters scored on his Spurs debut against Coventry City. He won his first domestic winners&#x27; medal in 1971 when Spurs beat Aston Villa 2–0 in the League Cup final, and his second European triumph when Spurs beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 3–2 on aggregate to win the 1972 UEFA Cup final. At the time, this was the only all-English European final until Manchester United beat Chelsea in the 2008 UEFA Champions League final. When Alan Mullery left for Fulham in 1972, Bill Nicholson made Martin club captain. In the 1973 Football League Cup final, Peters was the winning skipper as they defeated Norwich City 1–0. He completed one more full season with Spurs, who lost the 1974 UEFA Cup final to Feyenoord on aggregate. He then moved in March 1975 to Norwich City – managed by his former West Ham teammate John Bond – for a fee of £40,000. In total Peters played 260 times in all competitions, scoring 76 goals.

===Norwich City===
Peters, then aged 31, made his debut appearance for Norwich on 15 March 1975 in a 1–1 away draw with Manchester United. He helped newly promoted Norwich establish themselves in the First Division, making more than 200 appearances, and earning a testimonial against an all-star team which included most of the 1966 World Cup-winning England XI. He was voted Norwich City F.C. Player of the Season two years running, in 1976 and 1977, and in 2002 was made an inaugural member of the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame. In 1978, whilst still a Norwich City player, Peters was awarded an MBE for services to association football. Peters also travelled to Australia and played as a guest player for Victorian State League side Frankston City. For them he played five games, scoring three goals; the team won four and drew one of the matches in which he competed.

===Sheffield United===
He joined Sheffield United on 31 July 1980 as player-coach, eventually replacing Harry Haslam as manager.

==International career==
===1966 World Cup===
Alf Ramsey had seen Peters&#x27; potential quickly, and in May 1966 he gave the young midfielder his debut for England national team against Yugoslavia at Wembley. England won 2–0 and Peters had an outstanding debut. Nearly scoring twice he set up chances for Jimmy Greaves and for others. In the final preparation period for Ramsey prior to naming his squad for the 1966 FIFA World Cup, Peters played in two more of the scheduled warm-up games. Against Finland, he scored his first international goal in what was only his second appearance, and subsequently he made Ramsey&#x27;s squad for the competition, as did his West Ham teammates Bobby Moore (the England captain) and Geoff Hurst.

Though Peters did not play in the opening group game against Uruguay, the drab 0–0 draw prompted Ramsey into changes. The England coach had been toying with using a system which allowed narrow play through the centre, not operating with conventional wingers but instead with fitter, centralised players who could show willing in defence as well as spread the ball and their runs in attack. Peters therefore had become an ideal player for this 4-1-3-2 system, elegant in his distribution and strong in his forward running, yet showing the stamina, discipline and pace to get back and help the defence when required. This system was dubbed &quot;the wingless wonders&quot;.

Ramsey put Peters in the team for his fourth cap, for the second group game against Mexico, which England won 2–0. He kept his place as England got through their group, scraped past a violent Argentina side in the quarter finals (Peters&#x27; late cross set up Hurst&#x27;s header for the only goal) and beat Portugal in the last four. The West Germany awaited in the final.

A tense but open game at Wembley saw the score at 1–1 in the final quarter of an hour when England won a corner. Alan Ball delivered it to the edge of the area to Hurst, who tried a shot on the turn. The ball deflected high into the air and bounced down into the penalty area where Peters rifled home a half-volley. West Germany equalised in the final seconds, though glory would still come the team&#x27;s way with the 4–2 win in extra time, and Hurst – like Peters, winning only his eighth cap – completing a historic hat-trick.

===1970 World Cup===
Peters played in England&#x27;s three group games in the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, from which they qualified, again with West Germany waiting in the last eight. Peters scored against Germany again early in the second half – a run and finish from behind a defender which no West German player had spotted – to establish a 2–0 lead, but later Ramsey committed a tactical error by substituting Peters and Bobby Charlton with Colin Bell and Norman Hunter, and West Germany won 3–2 in extra-time.

===Later international career===
In 1972, Peters won his 50th England cap in a qualifier for UEFA Euro 1972, beating Switzerland 3–2. England failed to progress due to another defeat against West Germany, who went on to win the tournament. International disappointment for Peters was tempered mildly by more club success, and he scored the only goal as England beat Scotland at Wembley on 19 May 1973. It was his 20th goal for his country and would prove to be his last. England had been stuttering in their qualifying campaign for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, dropping points in a drawn game against Wales and then a 2–0 defeat against Poland in Chorzów on 6 June 1973. England needed to defeat Poland at Wembley on 17 October 1973 to qualify for the finals in Germany, and with an out-of-form Moore dropped from the side – he would subsequently play only once more for his country – Peters captained the side for the crucial game. A defensive error allowed Poland to score, and only a penalty allowed England to level up quickly. Allan Clarke scored from it, but England could not get the crucial winning goal. Poland went through after the match finished 1–1, meaning Peters would not play in a third successive World Cup competition.

At the age of 30, Peters&#x27; career at the highest level began to slip away. He played three more games for England, reaching a total of 67 caps, though his career with his country ended on 18 May 1974, as England lost 2–0 against Scotland at Hampden Park.

==Managerial career==
His wait to become manager was not long, his final game coming against Gillingham on 17 January 1981 which Haslam was too ill to attend, and at which there were demonstrations from the Sheffield United fans. Peters retired to take up the manager&#x27;s job the following day with United 12th in the table with 16 games to play, but was unable to halt the decline already in place, winning just three of the remaining games. For the first and only time in their history Sheffield United were relegated to the Fourth Division, and Peters resigned. On his retirement from professional football in January 1981, after a distinguished and injury-free career, he had made 882 appearances in total, scoring 220 goals. After he quit Sheffield United, Peters spent the 1982–83 season playing in defence for Gorleston in the Eastern Counties League.

==After football==

In 1984, he moved into the insurance business where he stayed until he was made redundant in July 2001.

Peters joined the board of directors at Spurs in a non-executive capacity in 1998, taking on a supporter-liaison role. He remained in that post for four years before stepping down, but remained one of the match-day welcomers in the hospitality suites at the club&#x27;s White Hart Lane ground. He also worked in the hospitality suites at Upton Park for West Ham home matches.

In 2006, Peters published his autobiography, &quot;The Ghost of &#x27;66&quot;. That same year he was inducted, with former manager Ron Greenwood, into the English Football Hall of Fame in recognition of his achievements as a player.

==Personal life==

In 1964, Peters married Kathleen Ward, with whom he had two children. They remained married until his death in 2019. Peters identified as a Conservative Party supporter when asked about his politics in 1972.

In 2016, it was announced that Peters had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Peters died on 21 December 2019, aged 76. Tributes were paid to him from football clubs he played for, including West Ham, Tottenham Hotspur, Norwich City and many others. In September 2021, Peters&#x27; ashes were interred in a foundation stone at West Ham&#x27;s ground, the London Stadium.

<doc id="484805" wikidata="Q310100" url="?curid=484805" title="Maxim Litvinov">
<text>Maxim Maximovich Litvinov (; born Meir Henoch Wallach-Finkelstein; 17 July 1876 – 31 December 1951) was a Russian revolutionary and prominent Soviet statesman and diplomat who served as People&#x27;s Commissar for Foreign Affairs from 1930 to 1939.

Litvinov was an advocate for diplomatic agreements leading to disarmament, and was influential in making the Soviet Union a party to the 1928 Kellogg–Briand Pact. He was also responsible for the 1929 Litvinov Protocol, a multilateral agreement to implement the Kellogg-Briand Pact between the Soviet Union and several neighboring states.

In 1930, Litvinov was appointed People&#x27;s Commissar of Foreign Affairs, the highest diplomatic position in the USSR. During the 1930s, Litvinov advocated the official Soviet policy of collective security with Western powers against Nazi Germany.

==Early life and first exile ==
Meir Henoch Wallach was born into a wealthy, Yiddish-speaking, Lithuanian Jewish banking family in Białystok, Grodno Governorate, Russian Empire. Meir was the second son of Moses and Anna Wallach. In 1881, Moses Wallach was arrested, held in prison for six weeks, then released without charge. Meir was educated at a local &quot;realschule&quot;; in 1893 he joined the army but was discharged in 1898 after he allegedly disobeyed an order to fire into a crowd of striking workers in Baku. That year, in Kiev, Wallach joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), which was considered an illegal organization; it was customary for its members to use pseudonyms. Meir changed his name to Maxim Litvinov—a common Litvak surname—but was also known as &quot;Papasha&quot; and &quot;Maximovich&quot;. Litvinov also wrote articles under the names &quot;M.G. Harrison&quot; and &quot;David Mordecai Finkelstein&quot;.

Litvinov&#x27;s early responsibilities included propaganda work in the Chernigov Governorate. In 1900, Litvinov became a member of the Kiev party committee, all of whom were arrested in 1901. After 18 months in custody, Litvinov and Nikolay Bauman organised a mass escape of 11 inmates from Lukyanivska Prison, overpowering a warden and using ropes and grappling irons to scale the walls. Litvinov moved to Geneva, where the founder of Russian Marxism, Georgi Plekhanov, enlisted him as an agent of the revolutionary newspaper &quot;Iskra&quot;. Litvinov organised a route to smuggle the newspaper from Germany into Russia.

In July 1903, Litvinov was in London for the party&#x27;s second congress when the RSDLP split. He became a founding member of the Bolshevik faction under Vladimir Lenin, whom Litvinov first met in the British Museum Reading Room. The two went to Hyde Park to hear some of the speeches, and remained in contact with each other during this period. Litvinov returned to Russia during the 1905 Revolution, when he became editor of the RSDLP&#x27;s first legal newspaper Novaya Zhizn in Saint Petersburg.

== Second emigration ==

When the Russian government began arresting the Bolsheviks in 1906, Maxim Litvinov left the country and spent the next ten years as an émigré and arms dealer for the party. He based himself in Paris and travelled throughout Europe. Posing as an officer in the Ecuadorian Army, he bought machine guns from the State Munitions Factory in Denmark, and posing as a Belgian businessman, he bought more weapons from Schroeder and Company of Germany. He then arranged for the whole consignment to be transported to Bulgaria, where he told the authorities the arms were destined for Macedonian and Armenian rebels fighting for independence in the Ottoman Empire. Litvinov then bought a yacht, and handed it and the weapons to the Armenian revolutionary Kamo to be smuggled across the Black Sea. The yacht, however, ran aground and the weapons were stolen by Romanian fishermen. Despite this setback, Litvinov successfully smuggled these arms into Russia via Finland and the Black Sea.

In 1907, Litivnov attended the fifth RSDLP congress in London. Initially, he relied on Rowton Houses for accommodation in London but the party eventually arranged a rented house for Litvinov, which he shared with Joseph Stalin, who also wanted to find more-comfortable housing than the Rowton hostels.

In January 1908, French police arrested Litvinov under the name Meer Wallach while carrying twelve 500-ruble banknotes that had been stolen in a bank robbery in Tiflis the year before. The Russian government demanded his extradition and the French Minister for Justice Aristide Briand ruled Litvinov&#x27;s crime was political and ordered him to be deported. He went to Belfast, Ireland, where he joined his sister Rifka and her family. There, he taught foreign languages in the Jewish Jaffe Public Elementary School until 1910.

Litvinov moved to England in 1910 and lived there for eight years. In 1912, he replaced Lenin as the Bolshevik representative on the International Socialist Bureau. When the First World War broke out in 1914, the Russian government requested all Russian émigrés who were in allied England and eligible for military service return to serve in the Imperial Russian Army. Litvinov was able to convince the English officer who interviewed him that he would be tried rather than conscripted if he returned to Russia.

In February 1915, Litvinov, uninvited, attended a conference of socialists from the Triple Entente that included Keir Hardie, Ramsay MacDonald and Emile Vandervelde; and the Mensheviks Yuri Martov and Ivan Maisky. Lenin prepared a statement demanding every socialist who held a government post should resign and opposing the continuation of the war. The conference chairman refused to allow Lenin to finish speaking. In the wake of this mainstream social-democratic endorsement of &quot;defensive warfare&quot;, Litvinov along with the rest of the exiled Bolsheviks in western Europe remained an outspoken public opponent of the war.

In England, Litvinov met and in 1916 married Ivy Low, the daughter of a Jewish university professor.

== Diplomatic career==
===First Soviet representative to Britain===
On 8 November 1917, a day after the October Revolution, the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars (&quot;Sovnarkom&quot;) appointed Maxim Litvinov as the Soviet government&#x27;s plenipotentiary representative in the United Kingdom. His accreditation was never officially formalised and his position as an unofficial diplomatic contact was analogous to that of Bruce Lockhart, Britain&#x27;s unofficial agent in Soviet Russia. Litvinov was allowed to speak freely, even after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which took Russia out of the war.

In January 1918, Litvinov addressed the Labour Party Conference, praising the achievements of the Revolution. Alexander Kerensky, second and last leader of the republican Russian Provisional Government that had previously installed after abdication of the Tsar and was in turn overthrown by Lenin, was welcomed by the British government on a visit to London and also addressed the Labour Party Conference, criticising the dictatorship and repression of Lenin&#x27;s government. Litvinov replied to Kerensky in the left-wing English press, criticising him as being supported by foreign powers and accused him of trying to restore Tsarism.

A mutiny took place in February 1918 on a Russian ship in the River Mersey. The police, having been warned of possible trouble, had the ship under surveillance. When shouts that the crew were threatening to kill their officers were heard, the ship was boarded and the crew were arrested. Shortly before the mutiny, a police report confirmed Litvinov had received the sailors very well. Litvinov had not tried to dissuade the sailors from carrying out the mutiny or to condemn it, and may have encouraged it. Litvinov also sought interviews with British, American, Australian and Canadian soldiers, and inculcated them with Bolshevik ideas, as well as inducing British and American soldiers of Jewish descent to carry on propaganda in their regiments. On one occasion, thirty Royal Engineers, along with some American and Canadian soldiers, were received in Litvinov&#x27;s office.

At the end of 1917, Litvinov had secured the release of Georgy Chicherin from Brixton prison, but in September 1918, the British government arrested Litvinov, ostensibly for having addressed public gatherings held in opposition to British intervention in the ongoing Russian Civil War. Litvinov was held until he was exchanged for Lockhart, who had been similarly imprisoned in Russia.

Following his release, Litvinov returned to Moscow, arriving there at the end of 1918. He was appointed to the governing collegium of the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Foreign Affairs &quot;(Narkomindel)&quot; and immediately dispatched on an official mission to Stockholm, Sweden, where he presented a Soviet peace appeal. Litvinov was subsequently deported from Sweden but spent the next months as a roving diplomat for the Soviet government, helping to broker a multilateral agreement allowing the exchange of prisoners of war from a range of combatants, including Russia, the UK and France. This successful negotiation amounted to &quot;de facto&quot; recognition of the new revolutionary Russian government by the other signatories to the agreement and established Litvinov&#x27;s importance in Soviet diplomacy.

Litvinov tried to intervene in Britain&#x27;s internal politics, agreeing to the request of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, a newspaper supporting the Labour Party, to ask the Soviet government for financial assistance. In view of the publicity caused by a leak in &quot;The Times&quot;, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; did not accept the money.

===Irish contacts and the Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement===
In February 1921, the Soviet government was approached by the government of the unilaterally declared Irish Republic in Dublin with proposals for a treaty of mutual recognition and assistance. Despairing of early American recognition for the Irish Republic, President of the Dáil Éireann Éamon de Valera had redirected his envoy Patrick McCartan from Washington to Moscow. McCartan may have assumed Litvinov, with his Irish experience, would be a ready ally. Litvinov, however, told McCarten the Soviet priority was a trade agreement with the UK.

In March 1921, the Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement, authorising trade between the two countries so gold sent to Britain to pay for goods could not be confiscated, was signed but the British government and the British press began to complain about Moscow-directed subversion. In June, the British government published a proposed treaty between the Dáil government and the Soviets, and related correspondence; the question of Communist intrigue in the Irish War of Independence made headlines.

Finally, the British Foreign Secretary sent a note of protest to the Soviet Government, charging it with responsibility for a range of intrigues against the British Government and its imperial interests. Litvinov replied that &quot;The British Foreign Office has been misled by a gang of professional forgers and swindlers, and had it known the dubious sources of its information, its note of 7 September [1921] would never have been produced&quot;, stating that the complaints of anti-British activities were in part based on such fictitious reports. The Russian Government wished to state that, after the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian agreement, it had instructed its representatives in the East to abstain from any anti-British propaganda, although on its part it felt compelled to place on record that the attitude of the British Government had lately been far from friendly towards Russia. He cited the imprisonment and expulsion of Russian trade agents in Constantinople, the co-operation with the French Government in the so-called ‘Russian question’, the continued support to French schemes frustrating international efforts to help relieve famine in Russia, and lastly the presentation of the British note of 7 September. At a time when France was inciting Poland and Rumania to make war on Russia, this did not induce the Russian Government to believe that it was the sincere desire of the British Government to foster friendly relations between the governments and peoples of the two countries.

===First Deputy People&#x27;s Commissar of Foreign Affairs===
In 1921, Litvinov was appointed First Deputy People&#x27;s Commissar of Foreign Affairs, second in command to People&#x27;s Commissar Georgy Chicherin (1872–1936). Although both men were loyal to the Soviet regime, Litvinov and Chicherin were temperamental opposites and became rivals. Chicherin had a cultivated, polished personal style but held strongly anti-Western opinions. He sought to hold Soviet Russia aloof from diplomatic deal-making with capitalist powers. According to diplomatic historian Jonathan Haslam, Litvinov was less erudite and coarser than Chicherin but was willing to deal in good faith with the West for peace and a pause for Soviet Russia to pursue internal development.

In 1924, full diplomatic relations were restored under the MacDonald Labour government. The Conservative Party and the business community continued to be hostile to the Soviet Union, partly because the Soviet Union had not honoured Tsarist debts and partly because of the fear of Bolshevism spreading to Britain, and considered the Bolshevist government should be militarily overthrown. This was exacerbated by the Soviet government&#x27;s support of the 1926 General Strike and criticism of the British Trades Union Congress (TUC) for calling off the strike. The Soviet government offered a gift of £25,000 to the TUC, which was refused, and £200,000 to the co-operative movement, which was accepted.

Litvinov wanted to prevent a deterioration of relations and suggested he should have talks with Hodgson, the UK&#x27;s &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; in Moscow. Hodgson, who was privately sympathetic to some of Litvinov&#x27;s complaints, communicated with the Foreign Office, giving various reasons for criticising Britain&#x27;s position. Britain had signed a trade agreement in 1921 and given the Soviet Government &quot;de jure&quot; recognition in 1923, and HM Government had recently indicated that it intended to maintain its relationship with the Soviet Government. Anti-red outbursts could prejudice its position in dealing with problems that needed discussion with the Soviet Government. Importantly, the Soviet Union, whatever her political complexion, was a badly needed market. Although anti-red sentiment might be useful in the political warfare at home, it was seen in Russia as an admission of weakness. However, most pressing, was the incalculable commercial harm. The insecurity would make the Soviet Government hesitant about placing orders in Britain, cause British firms to fight shy of Russian orders and frighten British banks from financing them.

The Conservative government, under pressure from Conservative MPs on the uncorroborated evidence of a dismissed employee that the Soviet Trade Mission had stolen a missing War Office document, successfully asked Parliament to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Although Chicherin advocated caution, Litvinov, presumably with Joseph Stalin&#x27;s support, said:

The decision was no surprise to the Soviet Government. It had already for long been aware that a rupture of diplomatic relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was being prepared by the whole policy of the present British Conservative Government, which has declined all proposals of the Soviet Government for the settlement of mutual relations by means of negotiations. The lack of results of the search of the Trade Delegation premises, which was carried out with utmost thoroughness over several days, is the most convincing proof of the loyalty and correctitude of the official agents of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics. The Soviet Government passes over with contempt the insinuations of a British Minister regarding espionage by the Trade Delegation and considers it beneath its dignity to reply to them. The Soviet Government places on record that the British Government had no legitimate ground for a police raid on the extraterritorial premises of the official Soviet agent.

Hodgson agreed with Litvinov that the police raid on the Arcos building in London was deplorable and said so in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; in 1941, showing his pleasure at Litvinov&#x27;s appointment as Soviet ambassador to the United States.

After the Labour Party won the most seats in the 1929 election, the new Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald, set about restoring relations with the Soviet Union on condition that the Soviet Union refrained from initiating propaganda in Britain. Litvinov was in favour of being conciliatory, but letters between Joseph Stalin and Vyacheslav Molotov show Stalin overruled Litvinov&#x27;s conciliatory attitude, resulting in British Foreign Secretary Arthur Henderson ignoring problems rather than working towards an effective agreement on propaganda, effectively giving unconditional recognition to the Soviet Union.

===Proponent of disarmament===
Litvinov supported disarmament, actively attending the Disarmament Preparatory Commission from 30 November 1927 until it was replaced by the World Disarmament Conference in Geneva in 1932. Initially he advocated total disarmament. French politician Joseph Paul-Boncour criticised such proposals:

Supposing you had total disarmament; if there was no international organisation taking charge of security, if you had no international force to ensure the maintenance of this security, if you had no international law such as we are endeavouring to lay down here, a powerful and populous nation would always have the power when it wished to do so on a small nation equally disarmed, less populous and less well equipped to resist an attack which might be made upon it.

Litvinov&#x27;s answer was:

Would small nations be less insecure after their powerful neighbours who have disarmed than they are now when, in addition to economic, financial, territorial and other superiorities possessed by the great powers, the latter also enjoy the immense advantage of greater armaments.

Litvinov&#x27;s proposals won him favourable publicity in radical circles in Western countries that were eager for disarmament and impatient at the commission&#x27;s slow progress. The national joint Council of the Labour Party, the Parliamentary Labour Party and the TUC passed a resolution expressing their sense of the great importance of proposals for general-and-simultaneous disarmament submitted by the Soviet delegation at the Commission in Geneva on 30 November 1927.

Litvinov favoured Soviet participation in the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928, which pledged signatories to the elimination of the use of war as a tool of foreign policy, a position opposite to that of his nominal superior Chicherin. Litvinov, who was frustrated by the failure of the Kellogg-Briand Pact signatories to ratify the treaty, proposed the Litvinov Protocol, in which signatories formally proclaimed themselves in mutual compliance with the pact&#x27;s goals. The protocol was signed in Moscow in February 1929 by the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Latvia, and Estonia, and later by several other countries.

== People&#x27;s Commissar of Foreign Affairs ==
In 1930, Joseph Stalin appointed Litvinov People&#x27;s Commissar for Foreign Affairs. Litvinov, who was a firm believer in collective security, worked to form a closer relationship with France and the United Kingdom, a policy seemingly at odds with the &quot;class against class&quot; line of the Third Period being advocated by Communist International. Litvinov remained the only leading official of Narkomindel in the mid-1930s who had direct personal access to Stalin and who could deal with Stalin&#x27;s inner circle on terms approaching equality; this was in contrast to other top foreign-affairs officials such as Boris Stomonyakov and Nikolay Krestinsky, for whom access was limited to occasional supplication.

Stalin was largely detached from and uninterested in foreign policy throughout the early 1930s, largely leaving the general operations of Narkomindel and the Comintern to their leaders. Litvinov had wide latitude to pursue policy objectives and was subject only to broad review and approval from the leadership. Stalin frequently delegated oversight to members of his personal secretariat, including Karl Radek, until mid-1936. As a result, Litvinov&#x27;s Narkomindel could pursue a moderate foreign-policy line, emphasising stable relations between governments leading towards general disarmament, which was, as one historian called it, a &quot;curious mismatch&quot; with the revolutionary militancy then being voiced by the Comintern.

On 6 February 1933, Litvinov made the most-significant speech of his career, in which he tried to define aggression. He stated that the internal situation of a country, alleged maladministration, possible danger to foreign residents, and civil unrest in a neighbouring country were not justifications for war. In 1946, the British Government would accuse the Soviet Union of not complying with Litvinov&#x27;s definition. Finland made similar criticisms against the Soviet Union in 1939.

Many delegates, such as British delegate Lord Cushendun, who said the failure of the Disarmament Conference would be gratifying to the Soviet delegation, derided Litvinov but due to the soundness of Litvinov&#x27;s argument and eloquence, his standing grew. In 1933, the Greek Chairman of the Political Commission of the League of Nations stated:It was with special pleasure he paid this tribute to the Soviet delegation since it demonstrated beyond doubt that when men rose above the contingencies of day-to-day politics and allowed themselves to be guided by the more general ideas which should lead the civilised world, it was found that there was a community of ideals which was capable with a little goodwill of bringing to fruition the noblest and most difficult enterprises.

In 1933, Litvinov was instrumental in winning a long-sought formal diplomatic recognition of the Soviet government by the United States. US President Franklin Roosevelt sent comedian Harpo Marx to the Soviet Union as a goodwill ambassador. Litvinov and Marx became friends and performed a routine on stage together. Litvinov also facilitated the acceptance of the Soviet Union into the League of Nations, where he represented his country from 1934 to 1938.

In 1935, Litvinov negotiated the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance and another treaty with Czechoslovakia with the aim of containing Nazi Germany&#x27;s aggression. Writing in &quot;A History of the League of Nations&quot; (1952), F. P. Walters expressed &quot;astonished admiration&quot;, praising Litvinov&#x27;s farsighted analysis:

Litvinov has been considered to have concentrated on taking strong measures against Italy, Japan and Germany, and being little interested in other matters. He praised the achievements of the Soviet Union but he may not have agreed with collective farming. At the time of the Moscow Trials, Litvinov was appointed to a committee that decided the fate of Bukharin and Rykov, voting for them to be expelled and tried but not executed, they were eventually handed to the NKVD. During the Great Purge, the Foreign Commissariat lacked ambassadors in nine capitals; Litvinov reported this to Stalin, noting the damage without criticising the cause. Indeed, Litvinov publicly endorsed the purges and the campaign against the Trotskyites, although this may have been out of self-preservation.

== Negotiations regarding Germany and dismissal ==
After the 1938 Munich Agreement, German state media derided Litvinov for his Jewish ancestry, referring to him as &quot;Finkelstein-Litvinov&quot;. On 15 April 1939, Litvinov sent a comprehensive proposal to Stalin for a tripartite agreement with Britain and France. The following day, Litvinov saw Stalin to discuss his draft, which Stalin approved. According to Soviet records, Litvinov submitted detailed arguments in favour of the proposed pact, which Stalin accepted. Litvinov stated they ought not to wait for the other side to propose what the Soviets wanted. Litvinov summarised his proposals, which were for mutual assistance in case of aggression against the Soviet Union, Britain or France; and support for all states bordering the Soviet Union, including Finland and the Baltic States. It also provided for rapid agreement on the form such assistance would take. There would be an agreement not to conclude a separate peace.

By 16 April, Stalin still had faith in Litvinov and had no immediate plans to remove him. No concrete proposals for a Nazi-Soviet pact had been made by either country. Litvinov said: &quot;We can expect urgent and complex negotiations with the French and especially the British. We need to monitor public opinion and try to influence it.&quot; The new proposals had Stalin&#x27;s support; Litvinov summoned the British Ambassador, William Seeds, while he was at the theatre with his wife. Litvinov could have had the proposals conveyed to the Embassy with a request for Seeds to visit Litvinov urgently in the morning.

Litvinov had a poor opinion of Neville Chamberlain, and was not surprised Russia&#x27;s proposal for an alliance was not welcomed, but he may have been surprised by the attitude of the British Foreign Office. Cadogan, in his diary, described Litvinov&#x27;s proposals as &quot;mischievous&quot;. A Foreign Office report to the Foreign Affairs Cabinet Committee termed them &#x27;inconvenient&#x27;. On 7 June 1939, Winston Churchill stated he &quot;much preferred the Russian proposals. They are simple. They are logical and conform to the main groupings of common interest.&quot; Churchill also stated the Soviet claim the Baltic States should be included in the triple guarantee was well founded. Three years later, Britain would agree a similar pact of assistance with the Soviet Union. Litvinov&#x27;s proposals were also conveyed to the French Ambassador Émile Naggiar.

As soon as the proposals reached the French Government, the first reaction of Georges Bonnet, the Foreign Minister, was different from that of the British Government and Foreign Office. Bonnet saw the Soviet Ambassador Jakob Suritz, who cabled that &quot;the first impression of the French is very favourable&quot;. Britain persuaded the French Government to take no action until a common policy had been formulated. In talks between the French and the British governments, both failed to either accept or reject the proposals until after Litvinov&#x27;s dismissal on 4 May. Molotov proceeded with negotiations for a pact and a military mission left for Moscow.

The Foreign Office confirmed to the US &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; on 8 August 1939 &quot;the military mission, which had now left for Moscow, had been told to make every effort to prolong discussions until 1 October 1939&quot;. Halifax disclosed to the Foreign Affairs Committee on 10 July 1939: &quot;Although the French were in favour of the military conversations commencing, the French Government thought that the military conversations would be spun out over a long time and as long as they were taking place we should be preventing Soviet Russia from entering the German camp.&quot;

===Dismissal===
On 3 May 1939, Stalin replaced Litvinov, who was closely identified with the anti-German position, with Vyacheslav Molotov. At a prearranged meeting, Stalin said: &quot;The Soviet Government intended to improve its relations with Hitler and if possible sign a pact with Nazi Germany. As a Jew and an avowed opponent of such a policy, Litvinov stood in the way.&quot; Litvinov argued and banged on the table. Stalin then demanded Litvinov to sign a letter of resignation. On the night of Litvinov&#x27;s dismissal, NKVD troops surrounded the offices of the Commissariat of Foreign Affairs. The telephone at Litvinov&#x27;s &quot;dacha&quot; was disconnected and the following morning, Molotov, Georgy Malenkov, and Lavrenty Beria arrived at the commissariat to inform Litvinov of his dismissal. Many of Litvinov&#x27;s aides were arrested and beaten, possibly to extract compromising information.

Hitler took Litvinov&#x27;s removal more seriously than Chamberlain. The German ambassador to the Soviet Union, Schulenburg, was in Iran. Hilger, the First Secretary, was summoned to see Hitler, who asked why Stalin might have dismissed Litvinov. Hilger said: &quot;According to my firm belief he [Stalin] had done so because Litvinov had pressed for an understanding with France and Britain while Stalin thought the Western powers were aiming to have the Soviet Union pull the chestnuts out of the fire in the event of war&quot;.

Litvinov was not in disgrace; he continued to attend official functions and carry out his duties as a member of the Supreme Soviet and the Central Committee.

Litvinov also attended the Supreme Soviet when the budget was presented and on the occasion of Molotov&#x27;s speech in support of the Nazi–Soviet Pact. There was no praise or recognition of Litvinov&#x27;s work after he had held the position of Foreign Minister for nine years. Two months later, when Litvinov applied for a passport to go to Vichy, France, to take the waters, it was refused, presumably on the grounds he might defect or abscond.

According to Louis Fischer, &quot;Litvinov never by hint or word approved of Stalin&#x27;s pact with Hitler&quot;. Ivy Litvinov stated: &quot;the Nazi-Soviet Pact had not inspired her husband with much confidence&quot;. Litvinov would not have been surprised if Germany had broken any agreement and would have ensured the USSR would have been well prepared for a German invasion of its territory.

===Aftermath of dismissal===
According to Holroyd-Doveton, Litvinov, if he had been Foreign Commissar, would have approved the Pact. Sheinis states when foreign correspondents first asked Litvinov about the Pact, he evaded the question, but then said: &quot;I think this calls for a closer look, because among other things enemies of the Soviet Union ascribe to me what I never said&quot;. Litvinov is reported to have told Ehrenburg: &quot;The Pact was absolutely necessary&quot;. He told foreign journalists:

The imperialists in these two countries had done everything they could to goad Hitler&#x27;s Germany against the Soviet Union by secret deals and provocative moves. In the circumstances the Soviet Union could either accept German proposals for a non-aggression treaty and thus secure a period of peace in which to redouble preparations to repulse the aggressor; or turn down Germany&#x27;s proposals and let the warmongers in the Western camp push the Soviet Union into an armed conflict with Germany in unfavourable circumstances and in a setting of complete isolation. In this situation the Soviet Government was compelled to make the difficult choice and conclude a non-aggression treaty with Germany. I, too, would probably have concluded a pact with Germany although a bit differently.

Litvinov&#x27;s replacement by Molotov significantly increased Stalin&#x27;s freedom to manoeuver in foreign policy. The dismissal of Litvinov, whose Jewish background was viewed disfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to &quot;purge the ministry of Jews&quot;. Recalling Stalin&#x27;s order, Molotov commented: &quot;Thank God for these words! Jews formed an absolute majority in the leadership and among the ambassadors. It wasn&#x27;t good.&quot;

Given Litvinov&#x27;s prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by Kremlin standards, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany. Molotov&#x27;s appointment was a signal to Germany the USSR would negotiate. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote Litvinov&#x27;s disappearance meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot; was &quot;more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan&quot;.

With regard to the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with secret protocols partitioning Eastern Europe between Germany and the USSR three months later, Hitler told military commanders; &quot;Litvinov&#x27;s replacement was decisive, because Litvinov was a Jewish&quot;. A German official told the Soviet Ambassador Hitler was pleased Litvinov&#x27;s replacement Molotov was not Jewish. Hitler also wrote to Benito Mussolini that Litvinov&#x27;s dismissal demonstrated the Kremlin&#x27;s readiness to alter relations with Berlin, which led to &quot;the most extensive nonaggression pact in existence&quot;. When Litvinov was asked about the reasons for his dismissal, he replied; &quot;Do you really think that I was the right person to sign a treaty with Hitler?&quot;

American historian Jeffrey Herf views Litvinov&#x27;s dismissal and the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact as conclusive proof the Nazi belief in a Jewish conspiracy that supposedly controlled the governments of the Soviet Union and other allied powers was completely false.

===Wartime career===

Following the Nazi–Soviet Pact, although given little official Soviet recognition, Stalin continued to respect Litvinov. The British Embassy records confirm Litvinov was conspicuous at the 1939 anniversary of the Revolution by Lenin&#x27;s Mausoleum. He was standing on the edge of a group that included Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Andreev, Beria, and Dimitrov. Litvinov was in full view of the diplomatic stand of foreign journalists, some of whom had no hesitation in exchanging salutations with Litvinov. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said about thirty members of the German Trade delegation, the German Military Attaché, and members of a Finnish delegation watched the parade. The emergence of Litvinov wearing his usual flat cap was apparently a source of interest to the German delegation near the tomb; it was Litvinov&#x27;s first public appearance for several months in the company as Stalin&#x27;s entourage. Litvinov was also in a conspicuous place at the 1940 celebration of the Russian Revolution. According to Holroyd-Doveton, no meaningful position was allotted by Stalin to Litvinov.

In the 21-month period between the declaration of war by France and Britain, and the invasion of the Soviet Union by Germany, Ivy Litvinov describes this period of her life. She said the family spent their time with their daughter-in-law in their &quot;dacha&quot; from Moscow and outside school holidays in the family apartment in Moscow, when they spent long weekends in the country. For two years, the family played bridge, read music, and went on long walks in the countryside with their two dogs.

On 21 February 1941, Litvinov was dismissed from the Central Committee of the Communist Party on the pretext of his inability to discharge his obligations as a member of the committee. According to Pope, he was dismissed because Stalin wanted to give no offence to the Germans. Litvinov said: &quot;My more than 40 years in the Party oblige me to say what I think about what has happened. I do not understand why I am being dealt with in such a peremptory style.&quot;

Stalin rejected everything Litvinov had said. When Stalin stopped speaking, Litvinov asked: &quot;Does that mean you consider me an enemy of the people?&quot; Stalin answered: &quot;We do not consider you an enemy of the people, but an honest revolutionary&quot;.

Litvinov had followed with anxiety the steady advance of Hitler&#x27;s armies across Europe and wondered how long Britain could hold out unsupported. Even to Litvinov, the German invasion of the Soviet Union was a surprise; he did not believe Hitler would risk embarking on a second front at this stage of the war.

===German invasion of the USSR===
The Soviet leaders, as well as Litvinov, were concerned Britain might come to an agreement with Germany. Litvinov was worried Rudolf Hess&#x27;s flight meant Britain was about to make peace with Germany. Litvinov stated all believed the British fleet was steaming up the North Sea for a joint attack with Germany on Leningrad and Kronstadt. The same day the German invasion of the USSR began, Churchill announced Britain&#x27;s intention to give full aid to the Soviet Union. When Litvinov heard of Churchill&#x27;s broadcast, he was much relieved. Nevertheless, Litvinov was suspicious of the British aristocracy.

== Ambassador to the United States and later ==
Following his dismissal as head of Narkomindel, Litvinov was dispatched to Washington, D.C., to serve as the Soviet ambassador to the United States. Like Churchill, Litvinov had doubts about the Munich Agreement. Following the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, Litvinov said in a radio broadcast to Britain and the United States: &quot;We always realized the danger which a Hitler victory in the West could constitute for us&quot;. After the United States entered the war, he encouraged President Franklin D. Roosevelt to focus on the Mediterranean and Middle East theatre to prevent Axis forces in North Africa from advancing towards the Caucasus.

Early in November 1941, Litvinov was summoned to see Stalin and told his services were required as ambassador to the United States. In the US, the appointment was met with enthusiasm. &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated: &quot;Stalin has decided to place his ablest and most forceful diplomat and one who enjoys greater prestige in this country. He is known as a man of exceptional ability, adroit as well as forceful. It is believed that Stalin, in designating him for the ambassadorship, felt Litvinov could exercise real influence in Washington.&quot;

President Roosevelt stated Litvinov&#x27;s appointment was &quot;most fortunate that the Soviet Government have deemed it advisable to send as ambassador a statesman who has already held high office in his own country&quot;. When Litvinov arrived in the US, growing Soviet resistance to the German army, which was racing to take Moscow before the onset of the Russian winter, was winning the Soviet Union supporters. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;:Both Mrs Cordell Hull, the Secretary of State&#x27;s wife, and the Vice-President&#x27;s wife, Mrs Wallace, had travelled to the Soviet Embassy for celebrations to mark the 24th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution in 1941, where they were greeted by Mr and Mrs Gromyko and Mrs Umansky. The Under Secretary of State, Sumner Welles, Jessie Jones, the Commercial Secretary, and Francis Biddle, the Attorney General, were also present. Most foreign countries except Spain and Finland were represented.

Litvinov immediately gained popularity and was instrumental in lobbying for billions of dollars worth of Lend-Lease military and humanitarian assistance from the United States to the Soviet Union. In early December 1941, the Soviet Union&#x27;s war-relief organisation called a large meeting in Madison Square, New York City, where the auditorium was filled to capacity. Litvinov, speaking in English, told of the suffering in the Soviet Union. A woman in the front row ran up to the stage and donated her diamond necklace; whilst another gave a cheque for $15,000. At the end, Litvinov said; &quot;What we need is a second front&quot;.

The highlight of Litvinov&#x27;s eighteen months as ambassador was the 25th celebration of the Russian Revolution on 7 November 1942. 1,200 guests, representing all of the United Nations, entered the reception hall to shake hands with Litvinov. Only the US president and his staff, at work on the African campaign, were missing. The Russians were happy they had more serious affairs with which to attend. Vice President Henry Wallace, Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles and Mrs Woodrow Wilson, Edward Stettinius—the Lend-Lease administrator—and Tom Connolly, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, were among the guests. Russian vodka and a sturgeon from the Volga were supplied to the guests.

The following day, Litvinov and his wife travelled to New York to attend celebrations. &quot;The New York Times&quot; on 8 November said Madison Square was overflowing with a wildly cheering crowd of 20,000 for the annual tribute to the Soviet Union in Litvinov&#x27;s presence. The event was attended by Wallace, General Lesley McNair, commanding general of Army Ground Forces, capitalist Thomas Lamont, and Catholic professor Francis McMahon, who said: &quot;not speaking up for Russia would be disloyal to his religion and country&quot;.

Roosevelt became annoyed with Litvinov&#x27;s second-front zeal; he told Averell Harriman: &quot;The US might ask for Litvinov&#x27;s recall&quot;. Harriman told Litvinov Roosevelt was upset but did not repeat what the President had said. Harriman said: &quot;If Litvinov continued that way, he would get into serious difficulties with the President. Litvinov, who had been ebullient, collapsed so completely.&quot; Litvinov&#x27;s ambassadorship was now experiencing difficulties. Litvinov said the Soviet Government had forbidden him from appearing in public or making any public speeches.

After returning to Soviet Union, Litvinov became deputy minister for foreign affairs. He was dismissed from his post after an interview given to Richard C. Hottelet on 18 June 1946 in which he said a war between the West and the Soviet Union was inevitable.

== Death and legacy ==
Litvinov died on 31 December 1951. After his death, rumours he was murdered on Stalin&#x27;s instructions to the Ministry of Internal Affairs circulated. According to Anastas Mikoyan, a lorry deliberately collided with Litvinov&#x27;s car as it rounded a bend near the Litvinov &quot;dacha&quot; on 31 December 1951, and he later died of his injuries. British television journalist Tim Tzouliadis stated; &quot;The assassination of Litvinov marked an intensification of Stalin&#x27;s anti-Semitic campaign&quot;. According to Litvinov&#x27;s wife and daughter, however, Stalin was still on good terms with Litvinov at the time of his death. They said he had serious heart problems and was given the best treatment available during the final weeks of his life, and that he died from a heart attack on 31 December 1951.

After Litvinov&#x27;s death, his widow Ivy remained in the Soviet Union until she returned to live in Britain in 1972.

In his reminiscences dictated to a supporter later in life, Vyacheslav Molotov—Litvinov&#x27;s replacement as chief of foreign affairs and right-hand man of Joseph Stalin—said Litvinov was &quot;intelligent&quot; and &quot;first rate&quot; but said Stalin and he &quot;didn&#x27;t trust him&quot; and consequently &quot;left him out of negotiations&quot; with the United States during the war. Molotov called Litvinov &quot;not a bad diplomat—a good one&quot; but also called him &quot;quite an opportunist&quot; who &quot;greatly sympathized with [Leon] Trotsky, [Grigory] Zinoviev, and [Lev] Kamenev&quot;. According to Molotov; &quot;Litvinov remained among the living [in the Great Purge] only by chance&quot;.

Litvinov&#x27;s grandson Pavel Litvinov, a physicist, writer and Soviet-era dissident, lives in the United States.

<text>Egilsay (, ) is one of the Orkney Islands in Scotland, lying east of Rousay. The anglicized name of Eagleshay was used in past centuries. The island is largely farmland and is known for St Magnus Church, dedicated or re-dedicated to Saint Magnus, who was killed on the island in 1117 by an axe blow to the head. For hundreds of years the story of St Magnus, part of the Orkneyinga saga, was considered just a legend until a skull with a large crack in it, such as it had been stricken by an axe, was found in the walls of St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall.

== Etymology ==
Unusually for the Northern Isles, it has been suggested that Egilsay may have a partly Gaelic name. While at first sight, it appears to be Egil&#x27;s island, &quot;Egil&quot; being a Norse personal name, the Gaelic &quot;eaglais&quot; (Celtic &quot;eccles&quot;) meaning church, may be part of the root, as the island is dominated by a church of pre-Norse foundation. The island of Kili Holm just to the north, may represent &quot;cille&quot;, a monastic cell.

== Present day ==
The island&#x27;s population was 26 as recorded by the 2011 census a drop of almost a third since 2001 when there were 37 usual residents. During the same period, Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.

Orkney Ferries sail from the island to Tingwall on the Orkney Mainland via Wyre and Rousay.

<doc id="484814" wikidata="Q537285" url="?curid=484814" title="Wyre, Orkney">
<text>Wyre (historically known as Viera and Veira) is one of the Orkney Islands, lying south-east of Rousay. It is and at its highest point. It is one of the smallest inhabited islands in the archipelago.

Orkney Ferries sail from the island to Tingwall on the Orkney Mainland, Egilsay and Rousay.

==History==
Wyre&#x27;s history is still very apparent, and it has two ancient monuments maintained by Historic Scotland, Cubbie Roo&#x27;s Castle and St. Mary&#x27;s Chapel.

Bishop Bjarni grew up on Wyre, and was the son of Kolbein Hruga (see Cubbie Roo&#x27;s Castle below.)

&quot;Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland&quot; says that he:

:&quot;composed the only significant work of Norse poetry to have survived in the [Orkney] islands, his &quot;Lay of the Jomsvikings&quot;. He also played an important part in securing the canonisation of Earl Rognvald.&quot;

The poet Edwin Muir (1887–1959), known for his prominent part in the Scottish Renaissance, born in Deerness on Mainland, Orkney , spent much of his childhood on Wyre. In his autobiography he said of himself - &quot;I&#x27;m an Orkneyman, a good Scandinavian&quot;, and commented that some of his happiest childhood years were spent here.

===Cubbie Roo&#x27;s Castle===
Cubbie Roo&#x27;s (or Cobbie Row&#x27;s ) Castle was built in the mid-12 century by Norse landowner, Kolbeinn hrúga. The stone fortification originally consisted of a small, central tower set in an oval enclosure, surrounded by two ditches, a stone wall and an earthen rampart. It is the oldest surviving medieval castle in Scotland and was mentioned in the &quot;Orkneyinga Saga&quot; as well as &quot;King Haakon&#x27;s saga&quot;. Historic Environment Scotland established the site as a scheduled monument in 1929.

===St Mary&#x27;s Chapel===
In the centre of the island is the roofless, but largely complete, twelfth-century St Mary&#x27;s Chapel. It is thought to have been built by a Norse chieftain, Kolbeinn hrúga or his son, Bjarni Kolbeinsson, Bishop of Orkney. The Romanesque style building was originally constructed of local rubble and lime mortar. During the late 19th century, the building was restored.

==Geography and geology==
Like most of Orkney, Wyre is made up of Old Red Sandstone of the Devonian period.

The island is low lying, and is shaped like an isosceles triangle on its side. It is separated from Rousay by Wyre Sound. Rousay is to the north, Gairsay to the south, Stronsay to the east, Mainland to the south west, and Shapinsay to the south east. Bu ties with Ae in Dumfries and Galloway as being Britain&#x27;s shortest name for a settlement.
==Wyre Sound==
Wyre is separated from the neighbouring island of Rousay by the Wyre Sound. The sound experiences strong tides, which creates the perfect conditions for maerl beds to form. The maerl beds in turn provide a sheltered habitat for species as peacock worms and various sponges, as well as small fish, shrimps, gobies and crabs. Since 2014 the sound, along with the neighbouring Rousay Sound (which separates the islands of Rousay and Egilsay), has been designated as a Nature Conservation Marine Protected Area (NCMPA). Fishing activities are controlled within the MPA, and no dredging, beam trawling, demersal trawling or Seine fishing is permitted.

==Wildlife==
Wyre is also known for its grey and common seals, and for birdlife including divers and ducks. The sounds around Wyre have been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because they support a wintering population of common loons.

<text>== Introduction to nominal data ==
A variable used to associate each data point in a set of observations, or in a particular instance, to a certain qualitative category is a categorical variable. Categorical variables have two types of scales, ordinal and nominal. The first type of categorical scale is dependent on natural ordering, levels that are defined by a sense of quality. Variables with this ordering convention are known as ordinal variables. In comparison, variables with unordered scales are nominal variables. 

A nominal variable, or nominal group, is a group of objects or ideas collectively grouped by a particular qualitative characteristic. Nominal variables do not have a natural order, which means that statistical analyses of these variables will always produce the same results, regardless of the order in which the data is presented. 

Even though ordinal variable statistical methods cannot be used for nominal groups, nominal group methods can be used for both types of categorical data sets; however, nominally categorizing ordinal data will remove order, limiting further dataset analysis to result in nominal outcomes.

==Valid performable operations on nominal data==
Since a nominal group consists of data that is either identified as a member or non-member, each individual data point carries no additional significance beyond group identification. Additionally, data identification justifies whether it is necessary to form new nominal groups based on the information available. Because nominal categories cannot be numerically organized or ranked, members associated with a nominal group cannot be placed in an ordinal or ratio form. 

Nominal data is often compared to ordinal and ratio data to determine if individual data points influence the behavior of quantitatively driven datasets. For example, the effect of race (nominal) on income (ratio) could be investigated by regressing the level of income upon one or more dummy variables that specify race. When nominal variables are used in these contexts, the valid data operations that may be performed are limited. While arithmetic operations and calculations measuring the central tendency of data (quantitative assignments of data analysis, including mean, median) cannot be performed on nominal categories, performable data operations include the comparison of frequencies and the frequency distribution, the determination of a mode, the creation of pivot tables, and uses of Chi-square goodness of fit and independence tests, coding and recoding, and logistic or probit regressions.
==Examples and logical analysis of nominal data==
As ‘nominal’ suggests, nominal groups are based on the name of the data it encapsulates. For example, citizenship is a nominal group. A person can either be a citizen of a country or not. With this, a citizen of Canada does not have “more citizenship” than another citizen of Canada; therefore, it is impossible to order citizenship by any mathematical logic.

Another example of name categorization would be identifying &quot;words that start with the letter &#x27;a&#x27;&quot;. There are thousands of words that start with the letter &#x27;a&#x27; but none have &quot;more&quot; of this nominal quality than others, meaning that the word starting with the letter ‘a’ is more important than determining the number of ‘a’s as the first letters of an instance because this is associated with membership rather than quantifying the data as an ordinal group. 

With this, the correlation of two nominal categories is difficult because some relationships that occur are spurious, where two or more variables are incorrectly assumed to correlate with one another. Data compared within categories may also be unimportant. For example, figuring out whether proportionally more Canadians have first names starting with the letter &#x27;a&#x27; than non-Canadians would be a fairly arbitrary, random exercise. However, the use of comparing nominal data with a frequency distribution to associate gender and political affiliation would be more effective since a correlation between the counts of a particular party affiliation would compare to the number of male and or female voters accounted in a dataset.

From a quantitative analysis perspective, one of the most common operations to perform on nominal data is dummy variable assignment, a method earlier introduced. For example, if a nominal variable has three categories (A, B, and C), two dummy variables would be created (for A and B) where C is the reference category, the nominal variable that serves as a baseline for variable comparison. Another example of this is the use of indicator variable coding that assigns a numerical value of 0 or 1 to each data point in a set. This method identifies whether individual observations belong to a particular group (set to one) or not (set to zero). This numerical association allows for more flexibility in nominal data analysis as it captures differences not only between distinct nominal groups, but also the differences present among data within a set, determining the interactions between nominal variables and other variables in a systematic context.

<text>North Ronaldsay (, also , ) is the northernmost island in the Orkney archipelago of Scotland. With an area of , it is the fourteenth-largest. It is mentioned in the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;; in modern times it is known for its historic lighthouse, migratory bird life and unusual breed of sheep.

==Name==
The name comes from the Norse &quot;Rinansey&quot;, meaning the island of St Ninian. By the 1300s the name was being confused with &quot;Rognvaldsey&quot;, the island of St Ronald, in the south of Orkney that they were named North Ronaldsay and South Ronaldsay to distinguish them from the other.

==Geography==
North Ronaldsay lies around north of its nearest neighbour, Sanday, at . It is around long and is defined by two large sandy bays; Linklet Bay on the eastern shoreline and South Bay at the south. The west of the island is very rocky, with many skerries. North Ronaldsay is low-lying and exposed; its climate is extremely changeable and frequently inclement. The surrounding waters are stormy and treacherous, and have been a notorious &quot;graveyard&quot; for ships (hence the unusually early provision of a lighthouse on the island).

Hollandstoun at the south of the island is the most sizable settlement; it lies roughly equidistant from the airfield and the pier. North Ronaldsay is also home to a bird observatory.

A dry stone dyke has been built to surround the island, the purpose of which is to keep the seaweed-eating local sheep off the arable land.

==History==

A well-preserved Iron Age broch, known as the Broch of Burrian, is located on the southern tip of the island. Excavations in 1870–71 uncovered a large number of Iron Age and Pictish artefacts, with occupation continuing up to the Norse occupation of the Orkney islands in the 9th century.

According to the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;, Torf-Einarr, the 10th-century Norse Earl of Orkney, killed Hálfdan Longlegs on North Ronaldsay in revenge for Hálfdan and his brother Gudrød Ljome&#x27;s slaying of Rögnvald Eysteinsson, Torf-Einarr&#x27;s father. Hálfdan and Gudrød, who were the sons of King Harald Finehair of Norway, had trapped Rögnvald in his house and set it alight. Harald, apparently appalled by his sons&#x27; actions, overthrew Gudrød and restored Rögnvald&#x27;s lands to his son, Thorir Rögnvaldarson, while Hálfdan fled westwards to Orkney and displaced Torf-Einarr. From a base in Caithness, Torf-Einarr resisted Hálfdan&#x27;s occupation of the islands. After a battle at sea, and a ruthless campaign on land, Torf-Einarr spied Hálfdan hiding on North Ronaldsay. The sagas claim that Hálfdan was captured, and sacrificed to Odin as a blood-eagle.

The &quot;Joseph&quot; of King&#x27;s Lynn was wrecked on Bride&#x27;s Ness beach in April 1586. The crew salvaged the brass guns but they were confiscated by the Earl of Orkney.

Holland House was built in 1727; the &quot;Old Beacon&quot;, dating from 1789, was the third lighthouse to be built by Thomas Smith for the Commissioners of the Northern Lights.

Overview of population trends:
==Transport==
Flights from North Ronaldsay Airport link the island with Kirkwall on the Orkney Mainland, as does a weekly ferry operated by Orkney Ferries. In the summer there are ferries on Tuesdays and Fridays. Flights are subsidized to £36 return, or £21 return for those who stay for at least one night.

==Economy==
The main industries on the island are crofting and sheep farming, where unique North Ronaldsay sheep are mostly farmed collectively. Tourism also plays an important role.
The island has a population of 60, roughly half of whom are descended from native islanders, and new islanders who have come to live there. There is great interest in attracting new families with young children in order to keep the school open.

==Wildlife==
North Ronaldsay was also a habitat for the Atlantic walrus through the mid-16th century.

The great auk was a North Atlantic flightless bird about the size of a goose; it became extinct in 1844. North Ronaldsay was one habitat for the great auk which was quite abundant until then. At one Neolithic site, great auk bones make up nearly 14% of bird bones.

The main purpose of the island&#x27;s bird observatory, established in 1987, is to conduct long-term monitoring of bird populations and migration. North Ronaldsay is well known as one of the best birdwatching sites in the country during the spring and autumn migration periods. The quantity and variety of birds that can be seen at these times is often spectacular.

The island’s coast has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports purple sandpipers and breeding black guillemots.

==Lighthouse==
=== Old Beacon ===

Dennis Head, in the northeast of the island, is home to a historic lighthouse known as the Old Beacon. The light was first established in 1789 by Thomas Smith. It was to be the first of many island lighthouses for Smith (he had previously worked on the lights at Kinnaird Head and Mull of Kintyre). Smith received assistance with the North Ronaldsay light from his stepson Robert Stevenson, and from Ezekiel Walker.

In 1809, with the construction of other nearby lighthouses, it was decided that the North Ronaldsay light was no longer required, and it was extinguished. The round stone tower was retained as a sea-mark, however, and the original beacon chamber at the top replaced by a vaulted roof, capped by a remarkable ball finial. The stone spiral staircase which once led to the beacon was demolished. The original keepers&#x27; houses, roofless but largely complete, survive below the tower. In 2006, it was one of the neglected buildings selected for the TV series &quot;Restoration&quot;.

=== Modern lighthouse ===

A new lighthouse was built nearby just 43 years later in 1852. The modern lighthouse lies at the north of the island at Point of Sinsoss, and boasts Britain&#x27;s tallest land-based lighthouse tower. The old fog siren with notable red trumpet was replaced by an electric diaphragm-type horn. That horn was discontinued in favour of a Tyfon horn consisting of 8 mini-trumpets installed on the building that once housed the fog siren. The Tyfon horn gives three blasts every 60 seconds. The electric beeper horn now lies flat on the ground next to the fog signal building. The fog signal is still in service today.

==Education==
The community has a single school, North Ronaldsay Primary School. It had a single student until July 2017, when its sole student graduated. Various organizations use the school building.

<text>The American alligator (Alligatormississippiensis), sometimes referred to as a gator, or common alligator is a large crocodilian reptile native to the Southeastern United States and a small section of northeastern Mexico. It is one of the two extant species in the genus &quot;Alligator&quot;, and is larger than the only other living alligator species, the Chinese alligator.

Adult male American alligators measure in length, and can weigh up to , with unverified sizes of up to and weights of making it the second largest member by length and the heaviest of the family Alligatoridae, after the black caiman. Females are smaller, measuring in length. The American alligator inhabits subtropical and tropical freshwater wetlands, such as marshes and cypress swamps, from southern Texas to North Carolina. It is distinguished from the sympatric American crocodile by its broader snout, with overlapping jaws and darker coloration, and is less tolerant of saltwater but more tolerant of cooler climates than the American crocodile, which is found only in tropical and warm subtropical climates.

American alligators are apex predators and consume fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Hatchlings feed mostly on invertebrates. They play an important role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms. Throughout the year (in particular during the breeding season), American alligators bellow to declare territory, and locate suitable mates. Male American alligators use infrasound to attract females. Eggs are laid in a nest of vegetation, sticks, leaves, and mud in a sheltered spot in or near the water. Young are born with yellow bands around their bodies and are protected by their mother for up to one year. This species displays parental care, which is rare for most reptiles. Mothers protect their eggs during the incubation period, and moves the hatchlings to the water using her mouth.

The conservation status of the American alligator is listed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Historically, hunting had decimated their population, and the American alligator was listed as an endangered species by the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Subsequent conservation efforts have allowed their numbers to increase and the species was removed from endangered status in 1987. The species is the official state reptile of three states: Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi.

== History and taxonomy ==
The American alligator was first classified in 1801 by French zoologist François Marie Daudin as &quot;Crocodilus mississipiensis&quot;. In 1807, Georges Cuvier created the genus &quot;Alligator&quot; for it, based on the English common name &quot;alligator&quot; (derived from Spanish word , &quot;the lizard&quot;).

The American alligator and its closest living relative, the Chinese alligator, belong the subfamily Alligatorinae. Alligatorinae is the sister group to the caimans of Caimaninae, which together comprise the family Alligatoridae, which can be shown in the cladogram below:
=== Evolution ===

Fossils identical to the existing American alligator are found throughout the Pleistocene, from 2.5 million to 11.7 thousand years ago. In 2016, a Late Miocene fossil skull of an alligator, dating to approximately seven or eight million years ago, was discovered in Marion County, Florida. Unlike the other extinct alligator species of the same genus, the fossil skull was virtually indistinguishable from that of the modern American alligator. This alligator and the American alligator are now considered to be sister taxa, suggesting that the &quot;A. mississippiensis&quot; lineage has existed in North America for seven to eight million years.

The alligator&#x27;s full mitochondrial genome was sequenced in the 1990s, and it suggests the animal evolved at a rate similar to mammals and greater than birds and most cold-blooded vertebrates. However, the full genome, published in 2014, suggests that the alligator evolved much more slowly than mammals and birds.

==Characteristics==
Domestic American alligators range from long and slender to short and robust, possibly in response to variations in factors such as growth rate, diet, and climate.

===Size===
The American alligator is a relatively large species of crocodilian. On average, it is the largest species in the family Alligatoridae, with only the black caiman being possibly larger. Weight varies considerably depending on length, age, health, season, and available food sources. Similar to many other reptiles that range expansively into temperate zones, American alligators from the northern end of their range, such as southern Arkansas, Alabama, and northern North Carolina, tend to reach smaller sizes. Large adult American alligators tend to be relatively robust and bulky compared to other similar-length crocodilians; for example, captive males measuring were found to weigh , although captive specimens may outweigh wild specimens due to lack of hunting behavior and other stressors.

Large male American alligators reach an expected maximum size up to in length and weigh up to , while females reach an expected maximum of . However, the largest free-ranging female had a total length of and weighed . On rare occasions, a large, old male may grow to an even greater length.

====Largest====
During the 19th and 20th centuries, larger males reaching were reported. The largest reported individual size was a male killed in 1890 by Edward McIlhenny on Marsh Island, Louisiana, and reportedly measured at in length, but no voucher specimen was available, since the American alligator was left on a muddy bank after having been measured due to having been too massive to relocate. If the size of this animal was correct, it would have weighed about . In Arkansas, a man killed an American alligator that was and . The largest American alligator ever killed in Florida was , as reported by the Everglades National Park, although this record is unverified. The largest American alligator scientifically verified in Florida for the period from 1977 to 1993 was reportedly and weighed , although another specimen (size estimated from skull) may have measured . A specimen that was long and weighed is the largest American alligator killed in Alabama and has been declared the SCI world record in 2014.

====Reported sizes====
====Average====
American alligators do not normally reach such extreme sizes. In mature males, most specimens grow up to about in length, and weigh up to , while in females, the mature size is normally around , with a body weight up to . In Newnans Lake, Florida, adult males averaged in weight and in length, while adult females averaged and measured . In Lake Griffin State Park, Florida, adults weighed on average . Weight at sexual maturity per one study was stated as averaging while adult weight was claimed as .

====Relation to age====
There is a common belief stated throughout reptilian literature that crocodilians, including the American alligator, exhibit indeterminate growth, meaning the animal continues to grow for the duration of its life. However, these claims are largely based on assumptions and observations of juvenile and young adult crocodilians, and recent studies are beginning to contradict this claim. For example, one long-term mark-recapture study (1979–2015) done at the Tom Yawkey Wildlife Center in South Carolina found evidence to support patterns of determinate growth, with growth ceasing upon reaching a certain age (43 years for males and 31 years for females).

====Sexual dimorphism====
While noticeable in very mature specimens, the sexual dimorphism in size of the American alligator is relatively modest among crocodilians. For contrast, the sexual dimorphism of saltwater crocodiles is much more extreme, with mature males nearly twice as long as and at least four times as heavy as female saltwater crocodiles. Given that female American alligators have relatively higher survival rates at an early age and a large percentage of given populations consists of immature or young breeding American alligators, relatively few large mature males of the expected mature length of or more are typically seen.

===Color===
Dorsally, adult American alligators may be olive, brown, gray, or black. However, they are on average one of the most darkly colored modern crocodilians (although other alligatorid family members are also fairly dark), and can reliably be distinguished by color via their more blackish dorsal scales against crocodiles. Meanwhile, their undersides are cream-colored. Some American alligators are missing or have an inhibited gene for melanin, which makes them albino. These American alligators are extremely rare and almost impossible to find in the wild. They could only survive in captivity, as they are very vulnerable to the sun and predators.

===Jaws, teeth, and snout===
American alligators have 74–80 teeth. As they grow and develop, the morphology of their teeth and jaws change significantly. Juveniles have small, needle-like teeth that become much more robust and narrow snouts that become broader as the individuals develop. These morphological changes correspond to shifts in the American alligators&#x27; diets, from smaller prey items such as fish and insects to larger prey items such as turtles, birds, and other large vertebrates. American alligators have broad snouts, especially in captive individuals. When the jaws are closed, the edges of the upper jaws cover the lower teeth, which fit into the jaws&#x27; hollows. Like the spectacled caiman, this species has a bony nasal ridge, though it is less prominent. American alligators are often mistaken for a similar animal: the American crocodile. An easy characteristic to distinguish the two is the fourth tooth. Whenever an American alligator&#x27;s mouth is closed, the fourth tooth is no longer visible. It is enclosed in a pocket in the upper jaw. Alligators also frequently lose and replace their teeth, about once every year. As alligators live a lengthy life, they can go through over 2,000 teeth in their lifetimes.

===Bite===
Adult American alligators held the record as having the strongest laboratory-measured bite of any living animal, measured at up to . This experiment had not been, at the time of the paper published, replicated in any other crocodilians, and the same laboratory was able to measure a greater bite force of in saltwater crocodiles; notwithstanding this very high biting force, the muscles opening the American alligator&#x27;s jaw are quite weak, and the jaws can be held closed by hand or tape when an American alligator is captured. No significant difference is noted between the bite forces of male and female American alligators of equal size. Another study noted that as the American alligator increases in size, the force of its bite also increases.

===Movement===
When on land, an American alligator moves either by sprawling or walking, the latter involving the reptile lifting its belly off the ground. The sprawling of American alligators and other crocodylians is not similar to that of salamanders and lizards, being similar to walking. Therefore, the two forms of land locomotion can be termed the &quot;low walk&quot; and the &quot;high walk&quot;. Unlike most other land vertebrates, American alligators increase their speed through the distal rather than proximal ends of their limbs. 

In the water, American alligators swim like fish, moving their pelvic regions and tails from side to side. Swimming is assisted by webbed rear feet as well, which bear four toes in contrast to the five toes of the front feet. During respiration, air flow is unidirectional, looping through the lungs during inhalation and exhalation; the American alligator&#x27;s abdominal muscles can alter the position of the lungs within the torso, thus shifting the center of buoyancy, which allows the American alligator to dive, rise, and roll within the water.

== Distribution ==

American alligators, being native both to the Nearctic and Neotropical realms, are found in the wild in the Southeastern United States, from the Lowcountry in South Carolina, south to Everglades National Park in Florida, and west to the southeastern region of Texas. They are found in parts of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas. Some of these locations appear to be relatively recent introductions, with often small but reproductive populations. Louisiana has the largest American alligator population of any U.S. state. In the future, possible American alligator populations may be found in areas of Mexico adjacent to the Texas border. The range of the American alligator is slowly expanding northwards, including into areas they once found such as Virginia. American alligators have been naturally expanding their range into Tennessee, and have established a small population in the southwestern part of that state via inland waterways, according to the state&#x27;s wildlife agency. They have been extirpated from Virginia, and occasional vagrants from North Carolina wander into the Great Dismal Swamp. 

In 2021, an individual was found in Calvert County, Maryland, near Chesapeake Bay, where it was shot and killed by a hunter using a crossbow. Additional reports of American alligators from this region exist, though they are believed to be escaped or released exotic pets.

== Conservation status ==

American alligators are currently listed as least concern by the IUCN Red List, even though from the 1800s to the mid-1900s, they were being hunted and poached by humans unsustainably.

Historically, hunting and habitat loss have severely affected American alligator populations throughout their range, and whether the species would survive was in doubt. In 1967, the American alligator was listed as an endangered species (under a law that was the precursor to the Endangered Species Act of 1973), since it was believed to be in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.

Both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and state wildlife agencies in the South contributed to the American alligator&#x27;s recovery. Protection under the Endangered Species Act allowed the species to recuperate in many areas where it had been depleted. States began monitoring their American alligator populations to ensure that they would continue to grow. In 1987, the USFWS removed the animal from the endangered species list, as it was considered to be fully recovered. The USFWS still regulates the legal trade in American alligators and their products to protect still endangered crocodilians that may be passed off as American alligators during trafficking.

American alligators are listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that international trade in the species (including parts and derivatives) is regulated.

==Habitat==
They inhabit swamps, streams, rivers, ponds, and lakes as well as wetland prairies interspersed with shallow open water and canals with associated levees. A lone American alligator was spotted for over 10 years living in a river north of Atlanta, Georgia. Females and juveniles are also found in Carolina Bays and other seasonal wetlands. While they prefer fresh water, American alligators may sometimes wander into brackish water, but are less tolerant of salt water than American crocodiles, as the salt glands on their tongues do not function. One study of American alligators in north-central Florida found the males preferred open lake water during the spring, while females used both swampy and open-water areas. During summer, males still preferred open water, while females remained in the swamps to construct their nests and lay their eggs. Both sexes may den underneath banks or clumps of trees during the winter.

In some areas of their range, American alligators are an unusual example of urban wildlife; golf courses are often favored by the species due to an abundance of water and a frequent supply of prey animals such as fish and birds.

===Cold tolerance===
American alligators are less vulnerable to cold than American crocodiles. Unlike an American crocodile, which would immediately succumb to the cold and drown in water at or less, an American alligator can survive in such temperatures for some time without displaying any signs of discomfort. This adaptiveness is thought to be why American alligators are widespread further north than the American crocodile. In fact, the American alligator is found farther from the equator and is more equipped to handle cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. When the water begins to freeze, American alligators go into a period of brumation; they stick their snouts through the surface, which allows them to breathe above the ice, and they can remain in this state for several days.

==Ecology and behavior==

===Basking===
American alligators primarily bask on shore, but also climb into and perch on tree limbs to bask if no shoreline is available. This is not often seen, since if disturbed, they quickly retreat back into the water by jumping from their perch.

===Holes===

American alligators modify wetland habitats, most dramatically in flat areas such as the Everglades, by constructing small ponds known as alligator holes. This behavior has qualified the American alligator to be considered a keystone species. Alligator holes retain water during the dry season and provide a refuge for aquatic organisms, which survive the dry season by seeking refuge in alligator holes, so are a source of future populations. The construction of nests along the periphery of alligator holes, as well as a buildup of soils during the excavation process, provides drier areas for other reptiles to nest and a place for plants that are intolerant of inundation to colonize. Alligator holes are an oasis during the Everglades dry season, so are consequently important foraging sites for other organisms. In the limestone depressions of cypress swamps, alligator holes tend to be large and deep, while those in marl prairies and rocky glades are usually small and shallow, and those in peat depressions of ridge and slough wetlands are more variable. 
===Feeding===
====Bite and mastication====
The teeth of the American alligator are designed to grip prey, but cannot rip or chew flesh like teeth of some other predators (such as canids and felids), and depend on their gizzard, instead, to masticate their food. The attainment of adulthood enables the consumption of large mammals and the crushing of large turtles. The American alligator is capable of biting through a turtle&#x27;s shell or a moderately sized mammal bone.

====Possible tool use====
American alligators have been documented using lures to hunt prey such as birds. This means they are among the first reptiles recorded to use tools. By balancing sticks and branches on their heads, American alligators are able to lure birds looking for suitable nesting material to kill and consume. This strategy, which is shared by the mugger crocodile, is particularly effective during the nesting season, in which birds are more likely to gather appropriate nesting materials. This strategy has been documented in two Florida zoos occurring multiple times a day in peak nesting season and in some parks in Louisiana. The use of tools was documented primarily during the peak rookery season when birds were primarily looking for sticks.

However, a three-day experiment to reproduce the use of sticks as lures, published in 2019, failed to document the behavior. Researchers placed sticks at densities of 30 to 35 sticks per meter squared near four captive populations, two near rookeries and two at no-rookery sites. While stick-displaying behavior was observed several times, it was not more frequent near rookeries. In fact, in some comparisons, it was associated with no-rookery sites. This implies American alligators do not tailor this behavior to specific contexts, leaving the purpose, if any, of stick-displaying ambiguous.

====Aquatic vs terrestrial prey====
Fish and other aquatic prey taken in the water or at the water&#x27;s edge form the major part of American alligator&#x27;s diet and may be eaten at any time of the day or night. Adult American alligators also spend considerable time hunting on land, up to from water, ambushing terrestrial animals on trailsides and road shoulders. Usually, terrestrial hunting occurs on nights with warm temperatures. When hunting terrestrial prey, American alligators may also ambush them from the edge of the water by grabbing them and pulling the prey into the water, the preferred method of predation of larger crocodiles.

Additionally, American alligators have recently been filmed and documented killing and eating sharks and rays; four incidents documented indicated that bonnetheads, lemon sharks, Atlantic stingrays, and nurse sharks are components of the animal&#x27;s diet. Sharks are also known to prey on American alligators, in turn, indicating that encounters between the two predators are common.

====Common prey====
American alligators are considered an apex predator throughout their range. They are opportunists and their diet is determined largely by both their size and age and the size and availability of prey. Most American alligators eat a wide variety of animals, including invertebrates, fish, birds, turtles, snakes, amphibians, and mammals. Hatchlings mostly feed on invertebrates such as insects, insect larvae, snails, spiders, and worms, as well as small fish and frogs. As they grow, American alligators gradually expand to larger prey. Once an American alligator reaches full size and power in adulthood, any animal living in the water or coming to the water to drink is potential prey. Most animals captured by American alligators are considerably smaller than itself. A few examples of animals consumed are largemouth bass, spotted gar, freshwater pearl mussels, American green tree frogs, yellow mud turtles, cottonmouths, common moorhens, and feral wild boars. Stomach contents show, among native mammals, muskrats and raccoons are some of the most commonly eaten species. In Louisiana, where introduced nutria are common, they are perhaps the most regular prey for adult American alligators, although only larger adults commonly eat this species. It has also been reported that large American alligators prey on medium-sized American alligators, which had preyed on hatchlings and smaller juveniles. 

If an American alligator&#x27;s primary food resource is not available, it will sometimes feed on carrion and non-prey items such as rocks and artificial objects, like bottle caps. These items help the American alligator in the process of digestion by crushing up the meat and bones of animals, especially animals with shells.

====Large animals====
Other animals may occasionally be eaten, even large deer or feral wild boars, but these are not normally part of the diet. American alligators occasionally prey on large mammals, but usually do so when fish and smaller prey levels go down. Rarely, American alligators have been observed killing and eating bobcats, but such events are not common and have little effect on bobcat populations. Although American alligators have been listed as predators of the Nilgai and the West Indian manatees, very little evidence exists of such predation. In the 2000s, when invasive Burmese pythons first occupied the Everglades, American alligators have been recorded preying on sizable snakes, possibly controlling populations and preventing the invasive species from spreading northwards. However, the python is also known to occasionally prey on alligators, a form of both competition and predation. American alligator predation on Florida panthers is rare, but has been documented. Such incidents usually involve a panther trying to cross a waterway or coming down to a swamp or river to get a drink. American alligator predation on American black bears has also been recorded.

====Domestic animals====
Occasionally, domestic animals, including dogs, cats, and calves, are taken as available, but are secondary to wild and feral prey. Other prey, including snakes, lizards, and various invertebrates, are eaten occasionally by adults.

====Birds====
Water birds, such as herons, egrets, storks, waterfowl and large dabbling rails such as gallinules or coots, are taken when possible. Occasionally, unwary adult birds are grabbed and eaten by American alligators, but most predation on bird species occurs with unsteady fledgling birds in late summer, as fledgling birds attempt to make their first flights near the water&#x27;s edge.
====Fruit====
In 2013, American alligators and other crocodilians were reported to also eat fruit. Such behavior has been witnessed, as well as documented from stomach contents, with the American alligators eating such fruit as wild grapes, elderberries, and citrus fruits directly from the trees. Thirty-four families and 46 genera of plants were represented among seeds and fruits found in the stomach contents of American alligators. The discovery of this unexpected part of the American alligator diet further reveals that they may be responsible for spreading seeds from the fruit they consume across their habitat. 

====Cooperative hunting====
Additionally, American alligators engage in what seems to be cooperative hunting. One observation of cooperative hunting techniques was where there are pushing American alligators and catching American alligators and they were observed taking turns in each position. Another observation said that about 60 American alligators gathered in an area and would form a semicircle with about half of them and would push the fish closer to the bank. Once one of the American alligators caught a fish another one would enter into its spot, and it would take the fish to the resting area. This was reported to have occurred two days in a row.

====In Florida and East Texas====
The diet of adult American alligators from central Florida lakes is dominated by fish, but the species is highly opportunistic based upon local availability. In Lake Griffin, fish made up 54% of the diet by weight, with catfish being most commonly consumed, while in Lake Apopka, fish made up 90% of the food and mostly shad were taken; in Lake Woodruff, the diet was 84% fish and largely consists of bass and sunfish. Unusually in these regions, reptiles and amphibians were the most important nonpiscivore prey, mostly turtles and water snakes. In southern Louisiana, crustaceans (largely crawfish and crabs) were found to be present in the southeastern American alligators, but largely absent in southwestern American alligators, which consumed a relatively high proportion of reptiles, although fish were the most recorded prey for adults, and adult males consumed a large portion of mammals.

In East Texas, diets were diverse and adult American alligators took mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates (e.g. snails) in often equal measure as they did fish.

===Vocalizations===
====Mechanism====
An American alligator is able to abduct and adduct the vocal folds of its larynx, but not to elongate or shorten them; yet in spite of this, it can modulate fundamental frequency very well. Their vocal folds consists of epithelium, lamina propria and muscle. Sounds ranged from 50 to 1200 Hz. In one experiment conducted on the larynx, the fundamental frequency depended on both the glottal gap and stiffness of the larynx tissues. As the frequency increases, there&#x27;s high tension and large strains. The fundamental frequency has been influenced by the glottal gap size and subglottal pressure and when the phonation threshold pressure has been exceeded, there will be vocal fold vibration.

====Calls====
Crocodilians are the most vocal of all non-avian reptiles and have a variety of different calls depending on the age, size, and sex of the animal. The American alligator can perform specific vocalizations to declare territory, signal distress, threaten competitors, and locate suitable mates. Juveniles can perform a high-pitched hatchling call (a &quot;yelping&quot; trait common to many crocodilian species&#x27; hatchling young) to alert their mothers when they are ready to emerge from the nest. Juveniles also make a distress call to alert their mothers if they are being threatened. Adult American alligators can growl, hiss, or cough to threaten others and declare territory.

====Bellowing====
Both males and females bellow loudly by sucking air into their lungs and blowing it out in intermittent, deep-toned roars to attract mates and declare territory. Males are known to use infrasound during mating bellows. Their bellowing initiates the beginning of the courtship period for American alligators. Bellowing is performed in a &quot;head oblique, tail arched&quot; posture. Infrasonic waves from a bellowing male can cause the surface of the water directly over and to either side of his back to literally &quot;sprinkle&quot;, in what is commonly called the &quot;water dance&quot;. Large bellowing &quot;choruses&quot; of American alligators during the breeding season are commonly initiated by females and perpetuated by males. Observers of large bellowing choruses have noted they are often felt more than they are heard due to the intense infrasound emitted by males. American alligators bellow in B flat (specifically &quot;B♭1&quot;, defined as an audio frequency of 58.27 Hz), and bellowing choruses can be induced by tuba players, sonic booms, and large aircraft.

===Lifespan===
American alligators typically live to the age of 50, and possibly over 70 years old. Males reach sexual maturity at around 11.6 years, and females at around 15.8 years. Although it was originally thought that American alligators never stop growing, studies have now found that males stop growing at around the age of 43 years, and females stop growing at around the age of 31 years.

===Reproduction===


====Breeding season====
The breeding season begins in the spring. On spring nights, American alligators gather in large numbers for group courtship, in the aforementioned &quot;water dances&quot;. A study conducted in the 1980s at an alligator farm showed that homosexual courtship is common, with two-thirds of the recorded instances of sexual behaviour having been between two males. The female builds a nest of vegetation, sticks, leaves, and mud in a sheltered spot in or near the water.

====Eggs====
After the female lays her 20 to 50 white eggs, about the size of a goose egg, she covers them with more vegetation, which heats as it decays, helping to keep the eggs warm. This differs from Nile crocodiles, which lay their eggs in pits. The temperature at which American alligator eggs develop determines their sex (see temperature-dependent sex determination). Studies have found that eggs hatched at a temperature below or a temperature above will produce female offspring, while those at a temperature between will produce male offspring. The nests built on levees are warmer, thus produce males, while the cooler nests of wet marsh produce females. The female remains near the nest throughout the 65-day incubation period, protecting it from intruders. When the young begin to hatch — their &quot;yelping&quot; calls can sometimes even be heard just before hatching commences — the mother quickly digs them out and carries them to the water in her mouth, as some other crocodilian species are known to do.

====Young====
The young are tiny replicas of adults, with a series of yellow bands around their bodies that serve as camouflage. Hatchlings gather into pods and are guarded by their mother and keep in contact with her through their &quot;yelping&quot; vocalizations. Young American alligators eat small fish, frogs, crayfish, and insects. They are preyed on by large fish, birds, raccoons, Florida panthers, and adult American alligators. Mother American alligators eventually become more aggressive towards their young, which encourages them to disperse. Young American alligators grow a year and reach adulthood at .

===Parasites===
American alligators are commonly infected with parasites. In a 2016 Texas study, 100% of the specimens collected were infected with parasites, and by at least 20 different species of parasites, including lung pentastomids, gastric nematodes, intestinal helminths. When compared to American alligators from different states there was no significant difference in prevalence.

===Interactions with exotic species===
Nutria were introduced into coastal marshes from South America in the mid-20th century, and their population has since exploded into the millions. They cause serious damage to coastal marshes and may dig burrows in levees. Hence, Louisiana has had a bounty to try to reduce nutria numbers. Large American alligators feed heavily on nutria, so American alligators may not only control nutria populations in Louisiana, but also prevent them spreading east into the Everglades. Since hunting and trapping preferentially take the large American alligators that are the most important in eating nutria, some changes in harvesting may be needed to capitalize on their ability to control nutria.

Recently, a population of Burmese pythons became established in Everglades National Park. Substantial American alligator populations in the Everglades might be a contributing factor, as a competitor, in keeping the python populations low, preventing the spread of the species north. While events of predation by Burmese pythons on sizable American alligators have been observed, no evidence of a net negative effect has been seen on overall American alligator populations.

===Indicators of environmental restoration===

American alligators play an important role in the restoration of the Everglades as biological indicators of restoration success. American alligators are highly sensitive to changes in the hydrology, salinity, and productivity of their ecosystems; all are factors that are expected to change with Everglades restoration. American alligators also may control the long-term vegetation dynamics in wetlands by reducing the population of small mammals, particularly nutria, which may otherwise overgraze marsh vegetation. In this way, the vital ecological service they provide may be important in reducing rates of coastal wetland losses in Louisiana. They may provide a protection service for water birds nesting on islands in freshwater wetlands. American alligators prevent predatory mammals from reaching island-based rookeries and in return eat spilled food and birds that fall from their nests. Wading birds appear to be attracted to areas with American alligators and have been known to nest at heavily trafficked tourist attractions with large numbers of American alligators, such as the St. Augustine Alligator Farm in St. Augustine, Florida.

== Relationship with humans ==
===Attacks on humans===
American alligators are capable of killing humans, but fatal attacks are rare. Mistaken identity leading to an attack is always possible, especially in or near cloudy waters. American alligators are often less aggressive towards humans than larger crocodile species, a few of which (mainly the Nile and saltwater crocodiles) may prey on humans with some regularity. Alligator bites are serious injuries, due to the reptile&#x27;s sheer bite force and risk of infection. Even with medical treatment, an American alligator bite may still result in a fatal infection.

As human populations increase, and as they build houses in low-lying areas, or fish or hunt near water, incidents are inevitable where humans intrude on American alligators and their habitats. Since 1948, 257 documented attacks on humans in Florida (about five incidents per year) have been reported, of which an estimated 23 resulted in death. Only nine fatal attacks occurred in the United States throughout the 1970s–1990s, but American alligators killed 12 people between 2001 and 2007. An additional report of alligator attacks showed a total of 376 injuries and 15 deaths recorded all from 1948 to 2004, leading this to an increase of the alligator population. In May 2006, American alligators killed three Floridians in less than a week. At least 28 fatal attacks by American alligators have occurred in the United States since 1970.

=== Wrestling ===
Since the late 1880s, alligator wrestling has been a source of entertainment for some. Created by the Miccosukee and Seminole tribes prior to its popularity for tourism, this tourism tradition remains popular despite criticism from animal-rights activists.

=== Farming ===
Today, alligator farming is a large, growing industry in Georgia, Florida, Texas, and Louisiana. These states produce a combined annual total of some 45,000 alligator hides. Alligator hides bring good prices and hides in the 6- to 7-ft range have sold for $300 each. The market for alligator meat is growing, and about of meat are produced annually. According to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, raw alligator meat contains roughly 200 Calories (840 kJ) per 3-oz (85-g) portion, of which 27 Calories (130 kJ) come from fat.
==Culture and film==
The American alligator is the official state reptile of Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi. Several organizations and products from Florida have been named after the animal.

&quot;Gators&quot; has been the nickname of the University of Florida&#x27;s sports teams since 1911. In 1908, a printer made a spur-of-the-moment decision to print an alligator emblem on a shipment of the school&#x27;s football pennants. The mascot stuck, and was made official in 1911, perhaps because the team captain&#x27;s nickname was Gator. Allegheny College and San Francisco State University both have Gators as their mascots, as well.

The Gator Bowl is a college football game held in Jacksonville annually since 1946, with Gator Bowl Stadium hosting the event until the 1993 edition. The Gatornationals is a NHRA drag race held at the Gainesville Raceway in Gainesville since 1970.

WGBH-TV, WGBX-TV, and the WGBH and WCRB radio stations share studios on Guest Street in northwest Boston&#x27;s Brighton neighborhood; WGBH-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located on Cabot Street (east of I-95/MA 128) in Needham, Massachusetts, on the former candelabra tower, which is shared with Fox affiliate WFXT and serves as a full power backup facility for sister station WGBX-TV as well as CBS owned-and-operated station WBZ-TV, ABC affiliate WCVB-TV, NBC O&amp;O WBTS-CD (which itself shares spectrum with WGBX) and independent station WSBK-TV.

==History==
===Organization and first broadcasts (1951–1955)===
The WGBH Educational Foundation received its first broadcast license for radio in April 1951 under the auspices of the Lowell Institute Cooperative Broadcasting Council, a consortium of local universities and cultural institutions, whose collaboration stems from an 1836 bequest by textile manufacturer John Lowell, Jr. that called for free public lectures for the citizens of Boston. WGBH (FM) first signed on the air on October 6, 1951, with a live broadcast of a performance by the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) originally awarded a construction permit to Waltham-based electronics company Raytheon to build a television station that would transmit on VHF channel 2 in Boston. Raytheon planned to launch a commercial television station using the call letters WRTB-TV (for &quot;Raytheon Television Broadcasting&quot;). However, after some setbacks and the cancellation of the construction permit license, WRTB never made it on the air, paving the way for the FCC to allocate channel 2 for non-commercial educational use. WGBH subsequently applied for and received a license to operate on that channel. The WGBH Educational Foundation obtained initial start-up funds for WGBH-TV from the Lincoln and Therese Filene Foundation.

The station&#x27;s callsign refers to Great Blue Hill (the highest point in the Boston area at an elevation of ), a location in Milton that served as the original location of WGBH-TV&#x27;s transmitter facility and where the transmitter for WGBH radio continues to operate to this day.

WGBH-TV first signed on the air at 5:20 pm on May 2, 1955, becoming the first public television station in Boston and the first non-commercial television station to sign on in New England. The first program to air on the station was &quot;Come and See&quot;, a children&#x27;s program hosted by Tony Saletan and Mary Lou Adams, which was filmed at Tufts Nursery Training School. Channel 2 originally served as a member station of the National Educational Television and Radio Center (NETRC), which evolved into National Educational Television (NET) in 1963; for its first few years on the air, channel 2 only broadcast on Monday through Fridays between 5:30 and 9 p.m.

===First studios near MIT (1956–1961)===
For the first six years, operations were based out of studio facilities located at 84 Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge, Massachusetts, directly across from the Rogers Building main entrance to MIT. The first television studios were located in second-floor space which originally had housed a roller skating rink. The uneven and rippled maple floors caused difficulties moving the heavy TV cameras, and loud creaking noises plagued the sound engineers.

In 1957, Hartford N. Gunn Jr. was appointed general manager of WGBH; he would later earn the Corporation for Public Broadcasting&#x27;s Ralph Lowell Award for his achievements in programming development. Under Gunn, who would serve until February 1970, WGBH made significant investments in technology and programming to improve the station&#x27;s profile, and set out to become a major producer of public television.

In February 1957, WGBH expanded its programming to weekends for the first time, adding a four-hour schedule on Sunday afternoons from 2:30 to 6:30 p.m. (its sign-on time on Sundays was later extended to 11 a.m. that May). In March 1958, channel 2 began offering academic instructional television programs, with the debut of eight weekly science programs aimed at students in the sixth grade, which were televised &quot;in some 48 separate school systems in and around the Boston area&quot;. In November of that year, the station installed a new full-power transmitter donated by Westinghouse, which increased channel 2&#x27;s transmitting power to 100,000 watts.

===Fire and recovery (1961–1969)===
During the early morning hours of October 14, 1961, a large fire devastated the Cambridge studios of WGBH-TV and WGBH radio. WGBH was only off the air for one day after the fire. Before the conflagration, WGBH had purchased a used Greyhound bus, and had begun refitting it as a mobile TV studio. It was parked behind the 84 Massachusetts Avenue building but somehow survived the disaster, and became a vital temporary facility for continued operations.

Until the WGBH Educational Foundation was able to build a new studio complex to replace the destroyed former building, the two stations arranged to operate from temporary offices, and had to produce their local programming from the studio facilities of various television stations in the Boston area and southern New Hampshire. WGBH-TV maintained a splintered operation, basing its master control operations at Newman Catholic Center at Boston University, production facilities (for which it was reserved to use late nights and on weekends) at the studios of then CBS affiliate WHDH-TV (channel 5, now defunct; allocation as of March 1972 operated by ABC affiliate WCVB-TV) on Morrissey Boulevard in Boston&#x27;s Dorchester section, and its film and tape library (including those which were salvaged from the fire) was housed at the studios of fellow NET station WENH-TV (channel 11) in Durham, New Hampshire.

Several area universities also chipped in to temporarily house other operations displaced by the fire: WGBH&#x27;s scenic department was relocated to Northeastern University, its arts department was set up on the Boston University campus, and programming and production offices were based in Cambridge&#x27;s Kendall Square neighborhood. WHDH, NBC affiliate WBZ-TV (channel 4, as of January 1995 a CBS owned-and-operated station) and ABC affiliate WNAC-TV (channel 7, now defunct; allocation now occupied by independent station WHDH that is unrelated to the above-mentioned WHDH-TV, which its channel is now used by WCVB-TV) also provided technical and production assistance to the WGBH television and radio stations until a permanent facility was built to reintegrate the stations&#x27; operations.

On August 29, 1963, WGBH-TV and WGBH radio both began operating from a new studio facility for the stations that was built at 125 Western Avenue in Boston&#x27;s Allston neighborhood (the post office box address that the station adopted at that time – P.O. Box 350, Boston, MA 02134 – would become associated with a jingle used on the WGBH-produced children&#x27;s program, &quot;ZOOM&quot;, both in its 1972 and 1999 adaptations, exhorting viewers to send in ideas for use on the show).

On June 18, 1966, WGBH-TV relocated its transmitter to a broadcast tower in Needham, Massachusetts, The following year on September 25, 1967, WGBH-TV gained a sister television station in the Boston area, WGBX-TV (channel 44), which has transmitted its signal from the Needham site since the station signed on. WGBX&#x27;s digital signal on UHF channel 32 shares the master antenna at the very top of the tower with several commercial stations in the market, while WGBH-TV&#x27;s channel 5 digital transmitter operates from a different tower on Cabot St, also in Needham.

The launch of WGBX was one facet of a plan developed by the WGBH Educational Foundation in the late 1960s to operate a network of six non-commercial television stations around Massachusetts. However, these plans never materialized in their intended form; besides WGBX, the only other station that ultimately made it on the air was WGBY (channel 57) in Springfield, which launched in 1971. Three additional WGBH-owned stations were to have launched, all of which were slated to use the letters &quot;WGB&quot; for the first three letters in their callsigns; these included WGBW, which was to broadcast on channel 35 in Adams (the &quot;W&quot; in its callsign was to stand for &quot;West&quot;; the callsign has since been reassigned to a radio station in Two Rivers, Wisconsin), along with two stations in New Bedford and Worcester.

On the night of April 5, 1968, WGBH-TV (at roughly three hours&#x27; notice) broadcast a James Brown concert from the Boston Garden, the night after Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. Boston Mayor Kevin White, who was worried that the concert would set off a riot, and certain that cancellation would be worse, contacted WGBH to air the concert on TV, and told the public to stay home and watch, helping prevent boycotts in the region. The concert would later be seen numerous times in the following days, helping the Boston area stay in peace.

===PBS affiliation and expansion (1970–2006)===

In 1970, longtime WGBH general manager Hartford N. Gunn Jr. resigned, to become founding President of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). This new organization was launched as an independent entity to supersede NET (which itself was integrated into its Newark, New Jersey outlet, WNDT (now WNET), per request by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting) and assumed many of the functions of its predecessor network. WGBH itself joined the new network. Over time, WGBH became a pioneer in public television, producing many programs that were seen on NET and later, PBS, that either originated at the station&#x27;s studio facilities or were otherwise produced by channel 2.
On October 31, 2003, WGBH launched Boston Kids &amp; Family TV, a PBS Kids Channel-affiliated local cable service that was developed in partnership with the City of Boston. Available to Comcast and RCN subscribers, the service took over channel space previously occupied by one of the city&#x27;s cable access channels, which carried a mix of public affairs programs, footage of city-sponsored events, and mayoral press conferences (some of the aforementioned content was moved to the city-managed Educational Channel). Boston Kids &amp; Family carried a mix of children&#x27;s programs produced by WGBH and other distributors—which were scheduled to avoid simulcasts with WGBH-TV or WGBX-TV—daily from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., and a repeating block of telecourse programs aimed at adults from 8 p.m. to 7 a.m. The channel intended to affiliate the subchannel with the planned PBS Kids Go! network, which was scheduled to launch in October 2006; however, PBS scuttled plans to launch the Kids Go! network prior to its launch (opting only to launch the brand as an afternoon-only sub-block within PBS&#x27;s existing children&#x27;s program lineup). After PBS Kids ceased network operations, Boston Kids &amp; Family was replaced by The Municipal Channel, which carried much of the programming offered by the service prior to the WGBH partnership.

As WGBH&#x27;s operations grew, the 125 Western Avenue building proved inadequate to support it and its sister stations; some administrative operations were moved across the street to 114 Western Avenue, with an overhead pedestrian bridge connecting the two buildings. By 2005, WGBH had facilities in more than a dozen buildings in the Allston area. The station&#x27;s need for more studio space dovetailed with Harvard Business School&#x27;s desire to expand its adjacent campus; Harvard already owned the land on which the WGBH studios were located, which the university had donated to WGBH for use to construct the Western Avenue facility in 1962 at a value of $250,000.

===New studios in Brighton and Back Bay (2007–present)===

WGBH built a new studio and headquarters complex, designed by James Polshek &amp; Partners, in the nearby Brighton neighborhood of Boston. The building, inaugurated in June 2007, spans the block of Market Street from Guest Street to North Beacon Street (1 Guest Street, where the lobby entrance of the new studio building is located, is the building&#x27;s postal address), with radio studios facing pedestrian traffic on Market Street. The outside of the building carries a &quot;digital mural&quot; LED screen, which displays a different image each day to automotive and rail commuters along the nearby Massachusetts Turnpike.

Television and radio programs continued to be recorded at the Western Avenue studios until the WGBH stations completed the migration of their operations into the new facility in September 2007. The old Western Avenue studios were renovated by Harvard University in 2011 to house the Harvard Innovation Lab.

WGBH-TV ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 2, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 19, using virtual channel 2. The FCC allowed WGBH-TV to run a DTV nightlight service until June 26, 2009. The DTV nightlight program consisted of an episode of &quot;This Old House&quot; which provided information regarding the digital television transition, which looped until the analog signal was turned off. However, the nightlight service had actually continued to run until around 12:07 a.m. on July 13, 2009, when its analog signal was turned off permanently.

In 2016, WGBH opened a new remote television and radio studio on the first floor of the newly-renovated Johnson Building of the Boston Public Library, located in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston. The facilities included a dedicated area of approximately for a news desk, three TV cameras, nine video monitors, radio microphones, and a news ticker, all open to public view. The remainder of the space is shared with the &quot;Newsfeed Cafe&quot;, a fast-casual restaurant which is open during and outside of studio operational hours. The facility is believed to be the first collaboration between a library and a permanent on-site news organization studio. The space is used for twice-weekly live broadcasts of &quot;Boston Public Radio&quot; with Jim Braude and Margery Eagan, weekly taping of &quot;Greater Boston&quot;, and various special events, such as live music performances, poetry recitals, and interviews with book authors. Events are generally open to the public and free of charge.

==Logo and soundmark==

On August 27, 2020, it was announced that the WGBH Educational Foundation would re-brand all of its operations as &quot;GBH&quot;, with WGBH-TV subsequently re-branding from &quot;WGBH 2&quot; to &quot;GBH 2&quot;. The organization felt that the inclusion of the &quot;W&quot; prefix was too synonymous with terrestrial broadcasting, and did not reflect its current multi-platform operations. WGBH also cited that &quot;GBH&quot; was already commonly-used as a shorthand name for the station. Along with the rebrand came a modified version of its iconic wordmark logo, in use since 1974.
Since the early 1970s, WGBH has used a distinctive soundmark created by composer Gershon Kingsley in conjunction with creative director Sylvia Davis and general manager Michael Rice. It is an electronic sound using a Moog synthesizer described as a crescendo. The sound has been updated periodically by manipulating the original recording with modern tools through the years, most recently in 2020.

==Programming==
As a PBS member station, much of WGBH-TV&#x27;s program schedule consists of educational and entertainment programming distributed by PBS to its member stations, including non-WGBH productions such as the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot;, the &quot;Nightly Business Report&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;Peg + Cat&quot;, and &quot;Nature&quot;; it also carries programs distributed by American Public Television and other sources to fill its schedule, alongside programs produced for exclusive local broadcast in the Boston market.

WGBH features a mix of live-action and animated children&#x27;s programs produced by the station and other distributors between 6 a.m. and 5 p.m., as well as on Saturday and Sunday mornings. The remainder of its weekday lineup includes a two-hour block of news and travel programs leading into prime time, with documentary, arts and entertainment programs provided by PBS shown Sunday through Fridays during prime time (encores of WGBH national productions typically air on Saturday evenings). Programming on Saturday afternoons focuses heavily on cooking and home improvement how-to shows (at one point, the station&#x27;s Saturday afternoon lineup was branded as &quot;How 2 Saturday&quot;), while Sunday afternoons focus mainly on travel shows along with some how-to programs.

===Original productions===
For the better part of its history, WGBH-TV has been a major producer of programming for PBS and its predecessor, NET. Channel 2 produces more than two-thirds of the programs that PBS distributes nationally to its member stations. Among them are longstanding PBS mainstays such as &quot;Nova&quot;, &quot;Frontline&quot;, &quot;Masterpiece&quot;, &quot;American Experience&quot;, &quot;The Victory Garden&quot;, and &quot;This Old House&quot;.

Other notable programs originated by WGBH have included &quot;The French Chef&quot; (a pioneering cooking show featuring Julia Child), and &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; (a major costume drama miniseries produced on-location that was the first challenger to the British dominance in such programming in America, and was PBS&#x27;s highest-rated series for many years). The station has co-produced many other period dramas in conjunction with British production companies. Broadcasts of concerts by the Boston Symphony established the genre as a staple on television.

WGBH has also engaged in several experiments in programming and technology that have become standard in television, including:
* Nam June Paik&#x27;s wild morphing of the television image, and antic adventures in narrative story-telling (&quot;What&#x27;s Happening, Mr. Silver?&quot;, &quot;Nine Heroes&quot;)
* Ron Hays&#x27; use of slit-scan imagery inspired by the yearning, driving themes of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Liebestod&quot;
* The two-screen color stereo dance program &quot;CITY/motion/space/game&quot;.
* Arts series produced in collaboration with Boston&#x27;s Museum of Fine Arts (&quot;Museum Open House, Images, Eye-to-Eye&quot;) set the bar for the medium and were a major contributing force in &quot;video art&quot;.
* The Workshop for New Television developed works in dance (Dan Wagoner&#x27;s &quot;George&#x27;s House&quot;) and in drama (Mary Feldhaus-Weber&#x27;s &quot;RED, BLUE, GOLD&quot;).

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
&lt;section begin=subs /&gt;

&lt;section end=subs /&gt;
The PBS subchannel is offered in ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) format from the transmitter of WUNI.

Note that due to WGBX&#x27;s channel share agreement with NBC&#x27;s WBTS-CD, WGBH instead carries the high definition feed identified as channel 44.1.

In 2010, WGBH-TV became the first television station in the Boston market to provide a mobile DTV signal. It transmits two free-to-air channels using the ATSC-M/H standard, at 2.75 Mbit/s, with its first subchannel labelled as &quot;WGBH CH 2&quot;.
===WGBH-DT2===
WGBH launched a digital subchannel on virtual channel 2.2 in December 2005, which initially served as an affiliate of the PBS World news and documentary service (the subchannel was branded as &quot;WGBH World&quot;). In 2007, World programming was moved to the 44.2 subchannel of WGBX; WGBH replaced the network with a standard definition simulcast of its analog feed. The station discontinued the SD simulcast of channel 2.1 on April 17, 2012, when WGBH-DT2 re-assumed the local affiliation rights to World, which was simulcast on WGBX-DT2 for several months after the switch, before the former subchannel became its exclusive Boston outlet.

===WGBH-DT3===
WGBH launched a tertiary subchannel on virtual channel 2.3 in 2005, which offered high definition program content separate from that seen on the station&#x27;s analog signal via the PBS-HD satellite feed; in 2008, the subchannel switched to a high-definition simulcast of the analog signal, with standard-definition programming presented in a windowboxed or letterboxed format. WGBH decommissioned the DT3 feed in 2010.

===Spectrum auction repacking===
In a list announcing the winning bids for stations which participated in the 2016 United States wireless spectrum auction released by the FCC on April 13, 2017, WGBH-TV was disclosed to have agreed to sell a portion of the broadcast spectrum allocated to its UHF channel 19 digital signal for a bid of $161,723,929; in a statement, the station said it would &quot;use the proceeds to expand its educational services to children and students, further its in-depth journalism, and strengthen its modest endowment.&quot; The station also consigned to move its digital allocation to a low-band VHF channel; the FCC assigned VHF channel 5 (the former analog channel allocation of WCVB-TV) as the post-repack digital allocation to which WGBH was reassigned once the repacking of auction and repack participant stations were occurred on August 2, 2019. WGBH-TV&#x27;s post repack facility on VHF 5 is located at the nearby American Tower owned facility on Cabot Street, also in Needham.

Because the VHF channel 5 signal was significantly weaker than the prior UHF channel 19 signal, the repack initially left many over-the-air viewers in the Greater Boston area unable to receive the station&#x27;s primary broadcasts on WGBH 2.1 and WGBX 44.1. A notice posted on the station&#x27;s website in August 2018 stated that a power upgrade was forthcoming which would boost the signal from 6.9 kW to 34.5 kW, but that the upgrade was &quot;temporarily on hold, pending the mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic&quot;. In the spring of 2021, the upgrade to 34.5 kW was finally completed, but a VHF antenna specifically designed to receive low-band signals (channels 2-6), such as an FM dipole antenna, is now required for most viewers.

===Former translator===
WGBH formerly operated a low-power translator in Hyannis, W08CH (channel 8), which later ceased operations. The translator&#x27;s license and callsign were deleted by the FCC in 2004.

===Television stations===
====WGBX-TV====

WGBH-TV operates a secondary station in the Boston market, WGBX-TV (channel 44), which signed on the air on September 25, 1967. The station&#x27;s schedule focuses on program genres not covered by WGBH-TV. Reruns of programs aired the previous evening on WGBX and WGBH-TV also make up a portion of the station&#x27;s programming schedule. WGBX also maintains several digital subchannels that rebroadcast programs produced by WGBH and other PBS member stations, and serves as a multiplex station which also rebroadcasts NBC station WBTS-CD throughout the entire Boston market.

====WGBY-TV====

GBH also owns WGBY (channel 57), the PBS member station for the Springfield, Massachusetts, market, which signed on the air on September 26, 1971. It was run separately from the Boston operations of WGBH television and radio and WGBX-TV.

In 2019, the station became part of New England Public Media, a joint venture with the local NPR station WFCR.

===Media Access Group===
Since its creation in 1990, WGBH&#x27;s Media Access Group is a leading provider of accessible media services to television producers, home video, websites, and movie theaters throughout the United States. The unit originated with the founding of The Caption Center in 1972, which invented the method of closed captioning to improve access to television programs for the deaf and hard-of-hearing (&quot;The French Chef&quot; was the first program to offer captioning provided by the unit), and created the Rear Window Captioning System for films. Along with providing closed captions for television programs seen on channel 2 and its sister stations, the Media Access Group is a major captioning provider for programs on other broadcast television networks and several cable channels. It also developed the Descriptive Video Service, and is the main provider for audio description soundtracks that give blind and low-vision viewers details about events occurring on-screen within an individual program, which can be found on streaming services as well as PBS stations, select broadcast networks and cable channels.

===Online resources===
The internet is WGBH&#x27;s third platform; all radio and television programs produced by the stations have web components that are available at wgbh.org. The WGBH website also incorporates &quot;web-only&quot; productions:

* WGBH Media Library and Archives – available at openvault.wgbh.org, the site features archived WGBH program content.
* FFFBI (The Fin, Fur and Feather Bureau of Investigation) – an interactive website aimed at children that was developed through a partnership with National Geographic; the site features interactive games themed in the style of a detective story that are designed to help children learn science and engineering principles.
* PBS LearningMedia – a partnership with PBS, which provides digital content and solutions for use in grade school instruction.
* The WGBH Lab – a partnership with the World network, which incorporates featured content produced by independent and public media filmmakers.

<text>The Israel Prize (; &quot;pras israél&quot;) is an award bestowed by the State of Israel, and regarded as the state&#x27;s highest cultural honor.

==History==
Prior to the Israel Prize, the most significant award in the arts was the Dizengoff prize and in literature the Bialik prize. awarded by the Tel Aviv municipality annually since 1930s.

The Israel Prize is awarded annually, on Israeli Independence Day, in a state ceremony in Jerusalem, in the presence of the President, the Prime Minister, the Speaker of the Knesset (Israel&#x27;s legislature), and the Supreme Court President. The prize was established in 1953 at the initiative of the Minister of Education Ben-Zion Dinor, who himself went on to win the prize in 1958 and 1973.

==Awarding the prize==
The prize is awarded in the following four areas, with the precise subfields changing from year to year in a cycle of 4 to 7 years, except for the last area, which is awarded annually:
* the humanities, social sciences, and Jewish studies
* life and exact sciences
* culture, arts, communication and sports
* lifetime achievement and exceptional contribution to the nation (since 1972)

The winners are selected by committees of judges, who pass on their recommendations to the Minister of Education. Prize winners are elected by ad-hoc committees, appointed by the minister of education for each category each year. The decisions of the committee must be unanimous. The prize money was NIS 75,000 as of 2008.

==Recipients==
Prominent winners include Shmuel Yosef Agnon, Martin Buber, Abba Eban, A. B. Yehoshua, Israel Aumann, Golda Meir, Amos Oz, Ephraim Kishon, Naomi Shemer, David Benvenisti, Leah Goldberg (posthumously) and Teddy Kollek, and organizations such as Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, Jewish Agency, Yad Vashem and Jewish National Fund. Though the prize is generally awarded to Israeli citizens only, in exceptional cases it can be awarded to non-Israelis who have held Israeli residency for many years. Zubin Mehta received a special award of the Israel Prize in 1991. Mehta is originally from India and was music advisor and later the music director of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra for 50 years until his retirement in 2019.

==Controversy==
The decision to award the prize to specific individuals has sometimes led to impassioned political debate. In 1993, the opposition of then Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to the nomination of Yeshayahu Leibowitz led Leibowitz to decline the prize. In 2004, Education and Culture Minister Limor Livnat, sent the decision to award the prize to the sculptor Yigal Tumarkin back to the prize committee. The decision was brought before the Supreme Court of Israel in the case of publicist Shmuel Shnitzer, politician Shulamit Aloni, professor Zeev Sternhell and Maccabi Tel Aviv basketball club chairman Shimon Mizrahi.

In February 2015, Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu vetoed the appointment of two members of the selection panel for the Israel Prize in Literature, prompting the other three members, including Ziva Ben-Porat, to resign in protest. Netanyahu explained that &quot;[t]oo often, it seemed that the extreme panel members were bestowing the prizes on their friends&quot;. One of the prize candidates Yigal Schwartz of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev withdrew his nomination and called on other candidates to do the same. Over the next few days, members of the committees for the literary research and film prizes also resigned, leaving only two members of the original 13, and many other candidates withdrew their nominations. David Grossman withdrew his candidature saying that &quot;Netanyahu&#x27;s move is a cynical and destructive ploy that violates the freedom of spirit, thought and creativity of Israel and I refuse to cooperate with it&quot;.

In August 2021 the Supreme Court of Israel unanimously overturned a decision in June by former Education Minister Yoav Gallant to overrule the award of the Israel Prize in mathematics and computer science to Oded Goldreich because of Goldreich&#x27;s stated views on the occupied territories. Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit had refused to defend in court Gallant&#x27;s withholding of the prize, which Mendelblit said &quot;deviated from the range of reasonableness and was not legal.&quot; The court&#x27;s majority opinion ruled that Yifat Shasha-Biton, Gallant&#x27;s successor as Education Minister, should decide whether to award the prize to Goldreich, while a minority opinion called for Goldreich to receive it without further review. In November 2021, Shasha-Biton announced that she would block Goldreich from receiving the prize. In an editorial, the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot; wrote that Goldreich&#x27;s &quot;[c]alling for the boycott of professional colleagues... is a red line that shouldn&#x27;t be crossed&quot;. A &quot;Haaretz&quot; editorial said that Shasha-Biton&#x27;s decision meant &quot;the most prestigious prize awarded by Israel will not be the mark of scientific excellence but of loyalty to the government&quot;. The Supreme Court eventually ruled in Goldreich&#x27;s favour and he received the prize.

In 2024, Education Minister, Yoav Kish announced that the traditional Israel Prize will not be awarded in 2024, and instead–because of the Oct. 7th massacre–there will be a single category of awards, recognizing Civil Heroism and Mutual Responsibility. The decision caused a lot of resistance, especially since it was seen as a way to avoid giving the prize to Eyal Waldman, an Israeli activist whose daughter was murdered by Hamas. Following a petition to the High Court of Israel, and the refusal of the Attorney General to defend Minister Kish in front of the Court, the decision was reversed, and the awards and the ceremony were conducted as usual.

<text>Papa Westray () (), also known as Papay, is one of the Orkney Islands in Scotland, United Kingdom. The fertile soil has long been a draw to the island.

Attractions on the island include Holland House with an associated folk museum and the Knap of Howar Neolithic farmstead run by Historic Scotland.

It is the ninth largest of the Orkney Islands with an area of . The island&#x27;s population was 90 as recorded by the 2011 census, an increase of over 35% since 2001 when there were only 65 usual residents. During the same period, Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.

==Infrastructure==
Orkney Ferries sail from Papa Westray to Pierowall&#x27;s Gill Pier. Twice a week - on Tuesday and Friday - the or provides a direct service to and from Kirkwall on the Orkney Mainland, also serving either Rapness on Westray, or North Ronaldsay. There are also occasional summer Sunday excursions.
Britten-Norman Islander aircraft operated by Loganair fly from Papa Westray Airport to Westray, North Ronaldsay, and Kirkwall; the hop from Papa Westray to Westray is the world&#x27;s shortest scheduled flight, at approximately 2 minutes.

==Wildlife==
At the northern tip of the island lies North Hill. At , it is the island&#x27;s highest point and an RSPB nature reserve. Many seabirds breed on the island, including Arctic terns and Arctic skuas. It was one of the last places where the great auk was found; the last individual was killed in 1813. The reserve is also home to the rare and tiny purple-flowered Scottish primrose &quot;Primula scotica&quot;.

The sea around most of the island is a Nature Conservation Marine Protection Area, in place to protect the feeding grounds of the island population of black guillemot. More than 500 breeding birds visit these seas each year, with many nesting on the offshore islet of the Holm of Papa.

Both North Hill and the nearby Holm of Papa have been designated Important Bird Areas (IBAs) by BirdLife International because they support breeding seabirds.

==History==
The Knap of Howar Neolithic farmstead (Historic Scotland; accessible at all times) is the oldest preserved house in northern Europe, dating from around 3500 BC. The homestead, which consists of two roughly rectangular stone rooms side by side, linked by an internal door, and with doors to the outside at the west end, is partially subterranean, and virtually complete to roof height. Examples of the round-bottomed Unstan ware have been found here, and provided the key to dating the settlement.

According to tradition, in the 8th century AD, the Pictish King Nechtan attempted to seduce a young woman from the island named &quot;Triduana&quot;, who in response gouged her own eyes out. She later became abbess of a nunnery at Restalrig, now part of Edinburgh, and was in due course canonised as St Tredwell. A chapel was consecrated to her on Papa Westray and became a place of pilgrimage for people with eye complaints.

The island is one of the &#x27;Papeys&#x27; or &#x27;islands of the &quot;papar&quot;&#x27;. Joseph Anderson noted that:

William Thomson suggests that &quot;perhaps &quot;Papay Tercia&quot; was the Holm of Papay — not a separate papar-site but a holm subsidiary to Papa Westray&quot;.

Also on the island is the 12th-century St Boniface&#x27;s Church (recently restored; open in summer) with a carved Norse &quot;hogback&quot; gravestone (probably also 12th century) in the churchyard. This stands on a substantial and largely unexcavated 9th century, or earlier, Pictish religious site – possibly including a bishop&#x27;s residence. Remains of a heavily eroded broch can be seen on the shore. Early Christian carved stones, which may date from as early as the 7th century AD, found at this site are on display in The Orkney Museum in Kirkwall and the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. These may be the earliest evidence for Christianity to survive in the Northern Isles.

Another ancient monument that can be visited is a well-preserved Neolithic chambered cairn on the small island of Holm of Papa Westray, a little east of Papay itself (and readily visible from the larger island). The long, stalled cairn, built of local stone, was once a communal burial place for the bones of an ancient community. It is protected by a modern roof and entered by a man-hole from above. This can be seen at any time of day, but visitors must arrange privately for a boat through the local co-op.

Papa Westray was the birthplace of the Orcadian educator and man of letters, John D. Mackay (1909 – 1970).

==St Tredwell&#x27;s Chapel==

The remains of St Tredwell&#x27;s Chapel stand on a conical mound on a small peninsula (about high and across in St Tredwell&#x27;s Loch. The remains of the late medieval walls can be seen, built over Iron Age remains, including a tunnel leading to a circular building or broch. The thick walls of the chapel and records of tracery work indicate an important and well-founded establishment.

The chapel was surveyed by Sir Henry Dryden in 1870 when its walls, of variable thickness, were still up to 6 feet high and the interior measured 20 ft 3in by 13 ft 10ins. The chapel was cleared of rubble by William Traill around 1880. He found 30 copper coins dating between the reigns of Charles II and George III under the chapel floor, along with a female skeleton.

In &quot;The Archaeological Sites and Monuments of Papa Westray and Westray&quot;, R.G. Lamb (1983:19) notes:
Immediately outside the W wall Traill broke into a subterranean passage which he followed N then NW for some 10m, passing several sets of door-checks and a side-chamber and entering a &#x27;circular building&#x27;. Finds from this structure, including a stone ball, are in NMAS (...); others are in Tankerness House Museum (...). The opening into the passage is now blocked by rubble; it is likely that this was part of a complex of late Iron Age buildings, on the wreckage of which the chapel was built. It is possible that that a broch lies at the core of the mound, on the lower SE slope of which a revetment-wall, 1.9m high and traceable for 11m, may be part of an outer wall or ringwork. A few metres to the N of the chapel are the footings of two small subrectangular buildings of indeterminate date. A cross-slab is said to have been seen some years ago in the deep water besides the islet, but an attempted recovery was unsuccessful

Miraculous cures are associated with St Tredwell, particularly in those suffering from eye afflictions. Pilgrims travelled to Papay from all of Orkney and the north seeking a cure. Marwick, in a paper written in 1925, cites John Brand in his &quot;Brief Description of Orkney&quot; (1700) as having much to say of the chapel:

People used to come to it from other isles; before the chapel door was a heap of small stones, &quot;into which the Superstituous People when they come, do cast a small stone or two for their offering, and some will cast in Money&quot;; the loch is &quot;held by the People as Medicinal&quot;; &quot;a Gentleman in the Countrey, who was much distressed with sore Eyes, went to this Loch and Washing there became sound and whole...with both which persons he who was Minister of the place for many years was well acquainted and told us that he saw them both before and after the Cure: The present minister of Westra told me that such as are able to walk use to go so many times about the Loch, as they think will perfect the cure before they make any use of the water, and that without speaking to any... not long since, he went to this Loch and found six so making their circuit...&quot; &quot;As for this Loch&#x27;s appearing like Blood, before any disaster befal the Royal Family, as some do report, we could find no ground to believe any such thing.

In the 19th century the Minister of Westray, John Armit, noted that:
Such was the veneration entertained by the inhabitants for this ancient saint, that it was with difficulty that the first Presbyterian minister of the parish could restrain them, of a Sunday morning, from paying their devotions at this ruin, previous to their attendance on public worship in the reformed church. Wonders, in the way of cure of bodily disease, are said to have been wrought by this saint, whose fame is now passed away and name almost forgotten.

==In popular culture==

The island is one of the principal locations in the 2024 film &quot;The Outrun&quot;, directed by Nora Fingscheidt.

<doc id="484837" wikidata="Q19391" url="?curid=484837" title="Feels like Home (Norah Jones album)">
<text>Feels like Home is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Norah Jones, released on February 10, 2004, through Blue Note Records. It serves as the follow-up to Jones&#x27; 2002 breakthrough album, &quot;Come Away with Me&quot;.

At the 47th Annual Grammy Awards, the album was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album. &quot;Sunrise&quot;, the album&#x27;s lead single, won the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. &quot;Creepin&#x27; In&quot;, featuring Dolly Parton, was also nominated for a Grammy, in the category of Best Country Collaboration with Vocals.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Feels like Home&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 74 out of 100, which indicates &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; based on 19 reviews.

Writing for Yahoo! Music, Ken Micallef gave the album a favorable review and said, &quot;Recalling &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; only for Jones&#x27;s sultry voice, the album has its share of pleasant throwaways, but those are balanced by a handful of starkly beautiful and excellently arranged songs.&quot; The A.V. Club&#x27;s Keith Phipps also gave it a favorable review and stated that the album &quot;should neither shock old fans nor disappoint those hoping to hear [Jones] reach for more.&quot; E! Online gave it a B+ and said, &quot;Instead of making any stupid concessions to her sudden celebrity... the Home girl plays it cool, carrying on with the same smooth vibes that made her a star.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; also gave it a B+, calling it &quot;A better record than &quot;Come Away&quot;--less piano bar, more honkey-tonk.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot; gave it four stars out of five and said the album was &quot;similar to the debut... But there&#x27;s a more vivid light-and-shade to the textures and a craft and depth to the compositions that represent a welcome distillation of Jones&#x27; art.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave the album a positive review and stated, &quot;If the choice of songs and beat and instrumentation were sometimes restrictive, still the piano and the voice endured.&quot; &quot;Blender&quot; gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and said that its mood was &quot;more or less the same, if slight friskier.&quot;

Other reviews are average, mixed or negative: &quot;Uncut&quot; gave the album three stars out of five and stated that, &quot;Yes, it&#x27;s an unchallenging and even deeply conservative record. But its class is positively aristocratic.&quot; &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; gave it two stars out of five and said, &quot;Material is everything to a chanteuse, and in contrast to &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;, the problem here is that Jones wrote/co-wrote almost half of the &quot;Home&quot;″s 13 tracks.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; only gave it one star out of five and said that the album was &quot;so inoffensive you have trouble remembering whether you put it on.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Feels like Home&quot; sold 1,022,000 copies in its first week of release in the U.S. It sold 395,000 copies in its second week and spent its first six weeks of release atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was the second best-selling album of 2004 in the U.S., selling 3,842,920 copies. It stands as the tenth largest first-week sales for a female artist, behind Adele&#x27;s &quot;25&quot;, Taylor Swift’s &quot;1989 (Taylor’s Version)&quot; and &quot;Midnights&quot;, Britney Spears&#x27; &quot;Oops...! I Did It Again&quot;, Taylor Swift&#x27;s &quot;1989&quot;, &quot;Reputation&quot;, &quot;Red&quot;, and &quot;Speak Now&quot;, and Lady Gaga&#x27;s &quot;Born This Way&quot;. In the Netherlands, it was the year&#x27;s best-selling album and the twenty-fourth best-selling album of the 2000s.

<text>The Saturn Award for Best Actress is one of the annual Saturn Awards given by the American professional organization, the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films. The Saturn Awards are the oldest film-specialized reward of achievements in science fiction, fantasy, and horror (another award, the Hugo Award is older but includes other genres and media). The Saturn Award included the Best Actress category for the first time in the 1974 film year.

The Saturn Award for Best Actress is the oldest prize to reward actresses in science fiction, fantasy, and horror films: other awards such as the Academy and Golden Globe Awards, despite supposedly disregarding the genre, gave little recognition to acting quality at the time. In 1996 the Saturns began to reward both film and television acting, and created the Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television. For the first two years it was awarded there were no nominees announced.

The actresses with the most nominations are Jamie Lee Curtis, Jodie Foster, Natalie Portman, Naomi Watts and Sigourney Weaver, who are all tied with five. Curtis, Foster, Portman, Watts, Sandra Bullock and Demi Moore are the only actresses to have won it twice. Portman and Michelle Yeoh are the only actresses to win both the Saturn Award and the Academy Award for Best Actress for the same film, while Weaver holds the record for most nominations for playing the same character (Ellen Ripley) with four. Foster is the youngest winner in this category, winning her first award in 1977 at age 13.

<doc id="484848" wikidata="Q261140" url="?curid=484848" title="Symphony No. 7 (Shostakovich)">
<text>Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphony No. 7 in C major, Op. 60, nicknamed the Leningrad Symphony, was begun in Leningrad, completed in the city of Samara (then known as Kuybyshev) in December 1941, and premiered in that city on March 5, 1942. At first dedicated to Lenin, it was eventually submitted in honor of the besieged city of Leningrad, where it was first played under dire circumstances on August 9, 1942, nearly a year into the siege by German forces.

The performance was broadcast by loudspeaker throughout the city and to the German forces in a show of resilience and defiance. The &quot;Leningrad&quot; soon became popular in both the Soviet Union and the West as a symbol of resistance to fascism and totalitarianism, thanks in part to the composer&#x27;s microfilming of the score in Samara and its clandestine delivery, via Tehran and Cairo, to New York, where Arturo Toscanini conducted the NBC Symphony Orchestra in a broadcast performance on July 19, 1942, and &quot;Time&quot; magazine placed Shostakovich on its cover. That popularity faded somewhat after 1945, but the work is still regarded as a major musical testament to the 27 million Soviet people who lost their lives in World War II, and it is often played at Leningrad Cemetery, where half a million victims of the 900-day Siege of Leningrad are buried.

==Length and form==
Shostakovich&#x27;s longest symphony, the work typically takes approximately 80 minutes to perform. It has four movements. Shostakovich at first gave them titles—&quot;War&quot;, &quot;Reminiscence&quot;, &quot;Home Expanses&quot;, and &quot;Victory&quot;—but he soon withdrew these and left the movements with their tempo markings alone.

===I. Allegretto===
The first movement is in a modified sonata form that the musicologist Hugh Ottaway described as &quot;misplaced and misshapen&quot;. It begins with a broad theme played by the strings in unison, which is later echoed by the woodwinds. This is followed by a slower section played by flutes and strings, which segues into a 22-measure ostinato march that Shostakovich anticipated would be compared to Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot;. At the end of the twelfth statement of the theme, the brass present an inverted version of the theme, which is developed into a climax. After this a slower, two-part section follows, with a bassoon solo introduced by a solo clarinet; then a soft recapitulation of the opening theme is played by the strings. The movement&#x27;s brief coda repeats fragments of the &quot;invasion&quot; theme, played by a solo trumpet and percussion.

===II. Moderato (poco allegretto)===
The second movement is the symphony&#x27;s shortest. Shostakovich referred to it as a &quot;very lyrical scherzo&quot;. It begins in the latter vein with a quiet, playful theme in the strings. Moments later, a solo oboe plays a high variation on the tune. Other instruments continue with tunes of their own for several moments. Then, in the middle of the movement, woodwinds interject with a brash, shrill theme, followed by brass, then strings, then woodwinds. This eventually leads to a quick, majestic passage that is another ostinato, but different from the invasion theme in the first movement. The remaining third of the movement is much like the beginning of the second movement.

===III. Adagio===
The third movement begins with slow, sustained woodwind notes, accentuated by the horns. This simple theme cadences, and is followed by a declamatory theme played by violins. Winds and brass repeat the string theme, which the strings take over with another brief variation. This transitions directly into a faster passage. The violins return with the opening theme of the movement. This builds into a somewhat frantic passage underlaid by an ostinato in the lower strings. This leads into a loud development section. The passage ends quickly, with the woodwinds bringing back the original theme, again echoed by the strings, just as in the beginning. The final third of the movement continues in this vein.

===IV. Allegro non troppo===
The finale begins with a quiet melody in the strings. The high strings hold the high notes, and are joined briefly by woodwinds. The low strings suddenly begin a quick march-like tune that is answered by violins and the rest of the orchestra. A transitional passage follows, with three-note figures played by high strings, accented by slap &quot;pizzicati&quot; in the cellos and basses. A slower and sharply accented section follows, which leads to a development section, with themes from earlier movements. Woodwinds build on one of these until violins take over with another theme that builds to the climax. The symphony ends in the key of C major.

==Overview==

===Composition===

====&quot;Music about terror&quot;====
There are conflicting accounts as to when Shostakovich began the symphony. Officially, he was said to have composed it in response to the German invasion. In his memoirs, the violinist Rostislav Dubinsky said that Shostakovich had already completed the first movement a year earlier. According to statements attributed to the composer in Solomon Volkov&#x27;s &quot;Testimony&quot;, he had planned the symphony before the German attack and that he had &quot;other enemies of humanity&quot; in mind when he composed the &quot;invasion theme&quot; of the first movement. In the book, he is also reported to have said that in dedicating the symphony to Leningrad, he had in mind not the city under German siege, but &quot;that Stalin destroyed and Hitler merely finished off.&quot; 

Shostakovich did not like talking about what he called &quot;creative plans,&quot; preferring to announce his works once they were completed. He did like to say, &quot;I think slowly but I write fast.&quot; In practice this meant that Shostakovich usually had a work completed in his head before he began writing it down. The Leningrad Symphony would not have made its announcement without the composer&#x27;s consent, so Shostakovich likely had a clear idea at that time of what his Seventh Symphony would portray.

Soviet music critic Lev Lebedinsky, a friend of the composer&#x27;s for many years, confirmed after the dawn of &quot;glasnost&quot; (&quot;openness&quot;) under Mikhail Gorbachev that Shostakovich had conceived the Seventh Symphony before Hitler invaded Russia:

Another important witness was the daughter-in-law of Maxim Litvinov, the man who served as Soviet foreign minister before the war, then was dismissed by Stalin. She heard Shostakovich play the Seventh Symphony on the piano in a private home during the war. The guests later discussed the music:

While Shostakovich could speak like this only in a very narrow circle of friends, it did not stop him from hinting to the Soviet Press about a hidden agenda for the Seventh Symphony. He insisted, for instance, that the &quot;central place&quot; of the first movement was not the &quot;invasion section&quot; (the part journalists usually asked about first). Rather, the movement&#x27;s core was the tragic music which followed the invasion section, which the composer described as &quot;a funeral march or, rather, a requiem.&quot; He continued, &quot;After the requiem comes an even more tragic episode. I do not know how to characterize that music. Perhaps it is a mother&#x27;s tears or even the feeling that the sorrow is so great that there are no more tears left.&quot;

====&quot;Inquisition for blood&quot;====
The Nazi attack and consequent relaxing of Soviet censorship gave Shostakovich the hope of writing the work for a mass audience. Shostakovich&#x27;s plan was for a single-movement symphony, including a chorus and a requiem-like passage for a vocal soloist, with a text taken from the Psalms of David. With the help of his best friend, critic Ivan Sollertinsky, who was knowledgeable about the Bible, he selected excerpts from the Ninth Psalm. The idea of individual suffering became interwoven in Shostakovich&#x27;s mind with the Lord God&#x27;s vengeance for the taking of innocent blood (Verse 12, &quot;New King James Version&quot;).

A public performance of a work with such a text would have been impossible before the German invasion. Now it was feasible, at least in theory, with the reference to &quot;blood&quot; applied at least officially to Hitler. With Stalin appealing to the Soviets&#x27; patriotic and religious sentiments, the authorities were no longer suppressing Orthodox themes or images.

====&quot;Invasion&quot; theme====
Musicologist Ludmila Mikheyeva (who is also Ivan Sollertinsky&#x27;s daughter-in-law) maintains that Shostakovich played the theme and its variations for his students before the war with Germany began.

While the word &quot;invasion&quot; was used by commentators in numerous articles and reviews, Shostakovich never used it to describe the episode or theme. &quot;I did not set myself the goal of a naturalistic depiction of military action (the roar of planes, the crash of tanks, cannon fire). I did not compose so-called battle music. I wanted to convey the context of grim events.&quot;

Neither does the &quot;invasion theme&quot; itself sound threatening, at least at first. For its latter half, Shostakovich quotes Graf Danilo&#x27;s entrance song, &quot;Da geh&#x27; ich zu Maxim,&quot; from Franz Lehár&#x27;s operetta &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;. &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; was also Hitler&#x27;s favorite operetta, which played well with Soviet propagandists writing about the symphony. A version of this song may have already existed in Russia. Set to the words, &quot;I&#x27;ll go and see Maxim,&quot; it was reportedly sung jokingly in the Shostakovich household to the composer&#x27;s son. Arthur Lourié called the theme a &quot;trite, intentionally silly motif,&quot; adding, &quot;This tune can be whistled by any Soviet man on the street. ...&quot; Conductor Yevgeny Mravinsky echoed Lourié when he called it a generalized image of spreading stupidity and triteness.

====Tensions not resolved====
Two weeks before he planned to complete the symphony-requiem, Shostakovich played what he had finished to date for Sollertinsky, who was being evacuated with the Leningrad Philharmonic. While playing the music, Shostakovich realized that what he had written was not a complete work in itself but actually the beginning of something much larger, since the tensions brought up in the symphony-requiem had not been resolved. The question now became whether to stay in the city to continue working or to evacuate and resume the work after a long hiatus. By the time he decided to evacuate, it was too late—the Germans had cut off the rail link to the city. He and his family were trapped.

On 2 September, the day the Germans began bombarding the city, Shostakovich began the second movement. Working at high intensity in between sprints to the nearest bomb shelter, he completed it within two weeks. Within hours he accepted a request to speak on Radio Leningrad to address the city. Adopting a matter-of-fact tone, he attempted to assure his fellow Leningraders that for him it was business as usual:

That evening he played what he had written so far to a small group of Leningrad musicians. After Shostakovich finished the first movement, there was a long silence. An air-raid warning sounded. No one moved. Everyone wanted to hear the piece again. The composer excused himself to take his family to the nearest air-raid shelter. When he returned, he repeated the first movement, which then was followed by the next movement for his guests. Their reaction encouraged him to start that night on the Adagio. He completed this movement on 29 September in the city. Shostakovich and his family were then evacuated to Moscow on 1 October 1941. They moved to Kuybyshev (now Samara) on 22 October, where the symphony was finally completed.
===Premières===

The world première was held in Kuybyshev on 5 March 1942. The Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra, conducted by Samuil Samosud, gave a rousing performance that was broadcast across the Soviet Union and later in the West as well. The Moscow première took place on 29 March 1942 in the Columned Hall of the House of Unions, by a joined orchestra of the Bolshoi Orchestra and the All-Union Radio Orchestra.

The microfilmed score was flown to Tehran and travelled to the West in April 1942. The symphony received its broadcast première in Europe by Sir Henry J. Wood and the London Philharmonic Orchestra on 22 June 1942 in London, and concert première at a Proms concert at the Royal Albert Hall. The première in North America took place in New York City on 19 July 1942, by the NBC Symphony Orchestra under Arturo Toscanini in a concert broadcast nationwide on the NBC radio network. This performance was originally released on LP by RCA Victor in 1967.

Much had to be done before the Leningrad première could take place. The Leningrad Radio Orchestra under Karl Eliasberg was the only remaining symphonic ensemble. The orchestra had survived—barely—but it had not been playing and musical broadcasts had ceased. Music was not considered a priority by Party officials. Political appeals took a significant part of the broadcast time. Even then, there were hours of silence because of the lack of agitators. As for the city itself, Leningrad surrounded by the Nazis had become a living hell, with eyewitness reports of people who had died of cold and starvation lying in doorways in stairwells. &quot;They lay there because people dropped them there, the way newborn infants used to be left. Janitors swept them away in the morning like rubbish. Funerals, graves, coffins were long forgotten. It was a flood of death that could not be managed. Entire families vanished, entire apartments with their collective families. Houses, streets and neighborhoods vanished.&quot;

The official hiatus on musical broadcasts had to end before the symphony could be performed. This happened quickly, with a complete about-face by Party authorities. Next was reforming the orchestra. Only 15 members were still available; the others had either starved to death or left to fight the enemy. Posters went up, requesting all Leningrad musicians to report to the Radio Committee. Efforts were also made to seek out those musicians who could not come. &quot;My God, how thin many of them were,&quot; one of the organizers of the performance remembered. &quot;How those people livened up when we started to ferret them out of their dark apartments. We were moved to tears when they brought out their concert clothes, their violins and cellos and flutes, and rehearsals began under the icy canopy of the studio.&quot; Orchestral players were given additional rations.

Before they tackled Shostakovich&#x27;s work, Eliasberg had the players go through pieces from the standard repertoire—Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov—which they also performed for broadcast. Because the city was still blockaded at the time, the score was flown by night in early July for rehearsal. A team of copyists worked for days to prepare the parts despite shortages of materials. At rehearsal, some musicians protested, not wanting to waste their little strength on an intricate and not very accessible work. Eliasberg threatened to hold back the additional rations, quelling any dissent.

The concert was given on 9 August 1942. Whether this date was chosen intentionally, it was the day Hitler had chosen previously to celebrate the fall of Leningrad with a lavish banquet at the Astoria Hotel. Loudspeakers broadcast the performance throughout the city as well as to the German forces in a move of psychological warfare. The Soviet commander of the Leningrad front, General Govorov, ordered a bombardment of German artillery positions in advance to ensure their silence during the performance of the symphony; a special operation, code-named &quot;Squall,&quot; was executed for precisely this purpose. Three thousand high-caliber shells were lobbed onto the enemy.

The symphony was not premiered in Germany until after the war. It took place in Berlin on 22 December 1946, with Sergiu Celibidache conducting the Berlin Philharmonic.

===Reception===
====In the Soviet Union====
At the first hearings of the Seventh, most listeners wept. This was true even when Shostakovich played the piece on the piano for friends. The requiem pages of the first movement made a special impression, much as the Largo of his Fifth Symphony had done. Some scholars believe that, as he had done in the Fifth, Shostakovich gave his audience a chance to express thoughts and suffering that, in the context of the Great Purges, had remained hidden and accumulated over many years. Because these previously hidden emotions were expressed with such power and passion, the Seventh became a major public event. Alexei Tolstoy, who played a pivotal role in the life of the Fifth Symphony, was the first to note the significance of the spontaneous reaction to the Seventh. After hearing an orchestral rehearsal of it, Tolstoy wrote a highly positive review of the work for &quot;Pravda&quot;.

Tolstoy&#x27;s actions became instrumental in the life of the Seventh. Tolstoy&#x27;s interpretation of the Seventh, in fact, lined up with Stalin&#x27;s stated support of nationalism and patriotism. At least as important was that without the help of the United States and the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union would not overcome Nazi Germany. The Soviets had been seen not long ago in the Western press as godless villains and barbarians. Now the Americans and British had to believe that the Soviet Union was helping protect the values those countries cherished from fascism for the Soviets to continue receiving those countries&#x27; support.

The Seventh was performed and broadcast all over the Soviet Union. Magazines and newspapers continued printing stories about it. The piece continued having enormous success. People still wept at concerts. They often rose from their seats during the finale and applauded thunderously afterwards.

====In the West====
Shostakovich had been known in the West before the war. When news of the Seventh quickly spread in the British and American press, the composer&#x27;s popularity soared. During the war, the work was very popular both in the West and in the Soviet Union as the embodiment of the fighting Russian spirit. The American premiere, in July 1942, was by the NBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Arturo Toscanini, broadcast on radio by NBC and preserved on transcription discs; RCA issued the recording on LP in 1967 and later reissued it on CD. The symphony was played 62 times in the United States in the 1942–43 season.

Shostakovich&#x27;s contemporaries were dismayed, even angered by its lack of subtlety, crudity, and overblown dramatics. Virgil Thomson wrote that, &quot;It seems to have been written for the slow-witted, the not very musical and the distracted,&quot; adding that if Shostakovich continued writing in this manner, it might &quot;eventually disqualify him for consideration as a serious composer. Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s only comment after hearing the American premiere on the radio was a grim &quot;Well, and now let&#x27;s have some tea.&quot;

Disdainful remarks about the symphony being nothing more than a bombastic accompaniment for a bad war movie were voiced immediately after the London and New York premieres. However, in the cultural and political ear of the period, they had no effect. The American public-relations machine had joined the Soviet propaganda arm in portraying the Seventh as a symbol of cooperation and spiritual unity of both peoples in their fight against the Nazis.

====Decline in appreciation====
Once the novelty of the Seventh Symphony had worn away, audience interest in the West quickly dissipated. One reason may have been the work&#x27;s length. At about 70-80 minutes, it was longer than any previous Shostakovich symphony. While it could be argued that he could have made the symphony 30 minutes shorter by condensing his message, the long passages of sparsely accompanied solos for wind instruments present listeners with the opportunity to study them, appreciate the inner character of the music as each instrument soliloquises on a given mood. To utilize this to the extent that Shostakovich did, combined with a wordless narrative style of mood-painting, necessitated an expansive time frame. This extended time span was criticized by some, including B.H. Haggin, who described the symphony as &quot;pretentious in style as in length&quot;. Hearing it only in the context of wartime propaganda, Western critics dismissed the symphony as a series of bombastic platitudes, and as such not worth serious consideration. The critic Ernest Newman famously remarked that, to find its place on the musical map, one should look along the seventieth degree of longitude and the last degree of platitude.

The Seventh Symphony was actually a convenient target from the start for Western critics. It was considered a strange, ungainly hybrid of Mahler and Stravinsky—too long, too broad-gestured in narrative and overly emotional in tone. Shostakovich placed the work&#x27;s emphasis on the effect of musical images rather than on symphonic coherence. Those images—stylized fanfares, march rhythms, ostinati, folkloric themes and pastoral episodes—could easily be considered models of socialist realism. Because of his emphasis on these images, Shostakovich can be said to have allowed the work&#x27;s message to outweigh its craftsmanship. For all these reasons, the music was considered both naïve and calculated in the West.

Soviet audiences did not come to the music with the same expectations as Western listeners. What mattered to Soviet listeners was the message and its serious moral content. The Seventh maintained its position with that audience because its content was so momentous. Nevertheless, as early as 1943 Soviet critics claimed the &quot;exultation&quot; of the Seventh&#x27;s finale was unconvincing, pointing out that the part of the symphony they found most effective—the march in the opening movement—represented not the defending Red Army but the Nazi invaders. They believed that Shostakovich&#x27;s pessimism had short-circuited what might have otherwise been a masterpiece in the vein of the &quot;1812 Overture&quot;. The tragic mood of Shostakovich&#x27;s next symphony, the Eighth, intensified the critical discord. Later, negative views from the West prejudiced the thinking of the Soviet elite toward the Seventh.

====Re-evaluation====
When &quot;Testimony&quot; was published in the West in 1979, Shostakovich&#x27;s overall anti-Stalinist tone and specific comments about the anti-totalitarian content hidden in the Fifth, Seventh and Eleventh Symphonies were held suspect initially. They were in some ways a complete about-face from the comments the West had received over the years, many times in the composer&#x27;s words. Questions also arose over Solomon Volkov&#x27;s role—to what degree he was a compiler of previously written material, a transcriber of the composer&#x27;s actual words from interviews, or an author essentially putting words into the composer&#x27;s mouth.

Two things happened. First was the composer&#x27;s son Maxim&#x27;s view on the accuracy of &quot;Testimony&quot;. He initially stated to the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, after his defection to the West in 1981, that it was a book &quot;about my father, not by him&quot;. Later, though, he reversed his position. In a BBC television interview with composer Michael Berkeley on 27 September 1986, Maxim admitted, &quot;It&#x27;s true. It&#x27;s accurate. ... The basis of the book is correct.&quot; Second, with the dawning of &quot;glasnost&quot;, those who were still alive and had known Shostakovich when he had written the &quot;Leningrad&quot; Symphony could now share their own stories with impunity. By doing so, they helped corroborate what had appeared in &quot;Testimony&quot;, allowing the West to reevaluate the symphony in light of their statements.

In recent years, the Seventh Symphony has again become more popular, along with the rest of Shostakovich&#x27;s work.

==Legacy==
It has been alleged that Béla Bartók quoted the march theme of the first movement in the &quot;Intermezzo interrotto&quot; of his &quot;Concerto for Orchestra&quot; in response to the Hungarian composer&#x27;s frustration about the positive reception of the piece. The quotation is clearly the &quot;invasion&quot; theme, and Bartók interjects his very romantic and lyrical melody in the movement with a much slower interpretation of Shostakovich&#x27;s invasion ostinato. The resemblance has been variously interpreted by later commentators as an accusation of tastelessness, as a commentary on the symphony&#x27;s over-popularity in Bartók&#x27;s eyes, and as an acknowledgement of the position of the artist in a totalitarian society. However, it is much more likely that Bartók (as his pianist friend György Sándor has said) was, like Shostakovich, parodying the very popular Lehár theme directly. This view has been confirmed by Bartók&#x27;s son Peter, in his book &quot;My father&quot;: Bartók had respect and admiration for Shostakovich&#x27;s works, and was mocking Lehár&#x27;s music and behind it the Nazis.

Janet Sobel&#x27;s painting &quot;Music&quot; was inspired by the symphony. She told Sidney Janis that the painting was her impression of the music that Shostakovich created in wartime: &quot;Shostakovich has captured the power of the Russian people and by his music has given them strength. His music has so stimulated me, and I have tried to present these feelings in my picture.&quot;

In the Ken Russell film &quot;Billion Dollar Brain&quot; (1967), music from the Leningrad Symphony accompanies the failed military invasion of the then Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic by Texas millionaire Midwinter (a pivotal scene reflecting the Battle of the Neva from &quot;Aleksandr Nevsky)&quot;. Incidentally, earlier on, Michael Caine as Harry Palmer attends the end of a concert of what is claimed to be the &quot;Leningrad&quot; Symphony, whereas in fact the finale from Shostakovich&#x27;s Eleventh Symphony is heard.

American rock band Fall Out Boy also used elements of Symphony No. 7 in their song &quot;The Phoenix&quot; from their 2013 album &quot;Save Rock and Roll&quot;. The same sample had been used by the German hip hop artist Peter Fox in his song &quot;Alles neu&quot; in 2008, and by Plan B in &quot;Ill Manors&quot; in 2012.

In 2015, M. T. Anderson wrote a book titled &quot;Symphony for the City of the Dead&quot;, a biography of both Shostakovich and Symphony No. 7. The book won several awards, including the Wall Street Journal&#x27;s &quot;Best Book of the Year&quot;.

==Film version==
On 31 January 2005, a film version of the Symphony premiered in St. Petersburg, with the St. Petersburg Academic Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Shostakovich&#x27;s son Maxim Shostakovich, accompanying a film directed by Georgy Paradzhanov, constructed from documentary materials, including film of the siege of Leningrad. Many survivors of the siege were guests at the performance. The composer&#x27;s widow Irina acted as script consultant to the project and its musical advisors included Rudolf Barshai and Boris Tishchenko. The film and performance were repeated, with the same artists, in London on 9 May 2005 at the Royal Albert Hall.

<text>Undine is a fairytale novella (&quot;&quot;) by Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué in which Undine, a water spirit, marries a knight named Huldbrand in order to gain a soul. Published in 1811, it is an early German romance, which has been translated into English and other languages.

== Plot summary ==
A knight named Huldbrand comes across a fisherman&#x27;s hut in the forest, and is welcomed in by the fisherman and his wife. He also meets their capricious eighteen-year-old foster daughter, Undine. The fisherman explains that years ago, their young daughter was lost in the lake and apparently drowned, but that same day, Undine appeared on their doorstep. Since then, they have raised her as their own.

Undine asks Huldbrand what he is doing in the forest. He explains that he was participating in a tournament when he met Bertalda, a duke&#x27;s foster daughter. As they flirted, she promised to give him her glove if he would explore the haunted forest. He did so, encountering strange and threatening spirits until he reached the fisherman’s home.

A storm arrives and a flood surrounds the house, stranding the group. During their time together, Huldbrand and Undine fall in love, although she continues to behave erratically and can seemingly control the weather. An elderly priest, Father Heilmann, arrives after being washed overboard from a ferry. Huldbrand suggests that the priest marry him and Undine, and they hold the ceremony immediately.

The morning after the wedding, Undine suddenly acts like a completely different person, kind and gentle. She explains to Huldbrand that elemental beings exist and she is a water spirit. Her species does not have immortal souls or any sense of morals, but can gain them by marrying humans. She was sent to live among humans by her parents, who hoped she would earn a soul in this way, and with her marriage to Huldbrand she has accomplished this. She fears that Huldbrand will leave now that he knows what she is, but he swears never to abandon her.

With the flood receding, Huldbrand and Undine depart for his home. On the way they encounter Kuhleborn, a shapeshifting water spirit and Undine&#x27;s uncle. She is now frightened of him and begs him to leave, and Huldbrand tries to attack him, only for Kuhleborn to vanish into a waterfall.

In the city, everyone welcomes Huldbrand back. Bertalda is deeply disappointed when she learns that he is now married, but becomes friends with Undine. One day, Kuhleborn visits Undine briefly, warning her of Bertalda. She rejects his warning but reveals at dinner that he told her who Bertalda&#x27;s true parents areUndine&#x27;s own foster parents, the fisherman and his wife, whom she has brought to meet her. Bertalda is the child who they believed had drowned. Instead of the joyful reunion Undine expects, Bertalda feels humiliated to realize that she was born a peasant. She publicly reviles them and calls Undine a witch, but her identity is proven by her birthmarks.

Bertalda’s behavior causes both her foster parents and biological parents to disown her. Destitute, she begs Undine for forgiveness. Undine immediately takes her into her home, but Bertalda remains fearful of her, and Huldbrand&#x27;s attraction to Bertalda resurfaces, leading to tension.

Undine orders the servants to seal up a fountain in their castle’s courtyard. Bertalda, who uses the water for her complexion, argues with her and complains to Huldbrand. He harshly demands an explanation. Undine explains that she is protecting their home from the malicious Kuhleborn, who would be able to enter through the fountain. She then asks Huldbrand never to speak angrily to her while they are near water, or her relatives will take her away. He contritely agrees.

Bertalda flees the castle in shame, and Huldbrand goes to rescue her. Kuhleborn, in different forms, torments and tricks the pair. He is about to drown them with a flood when Undine arrives, calms the waters, and carries them to safety.

The three live in peace for a while, until they decide to take a trip along the Danube to Vienna. While on the river, Kuhleborn continually torments them with storms, waves and frightening apparitions. The sailors and servants become suspicious of Undine as she magically stops these attacks, and Huldbrand begins to resent her. When a water spirit steals Bertalda&#x27;s golden necklace, Undine immediately offers her a coral necklace to replace it. Seeing this as a sign that Undine is colluding with the spirits, Huldbrand throws the coral necklace overboard and accuses her of being a sorceress. As she predicted, Undine disappears into the river, but not before sadly warning him to remain true to her.

Huldbrand grieves her loss, but as time goes on, decides to marry Bertalda. He even asks Father Heilmann to perform the wedding, but he refuses. The priest has received messages from Undine and cautions Huldbrand against breaking his wedding vows by taking another wife while Undine still lives. Huldbrand himself dreams of Undine and Kuhleborn talking beneath the sea, saying that if Huldbrand marries another, Undine will be compelled to kill him. Undine says that she has protected the castle by sealing the fountain, so no water spirits including herself can go there, but Kuhleborn points out that Huldbrand will be doomed if he ever unseals the fountain or leaves the castle.

Despite these warnings, Huldbrand continues with the wedding. Immediately after the ceremony, Bertalda wishes for water from the sealed fountain. The servants uncover the fountain, only for the veiled and weeping Undine to rise from it. She enters the castle and kisses Huldbrand, drowning him with her tears. She appears once more during his funeral and transforms into a stream encircling his grave, so that she is eternally embracing him.

== Inspirations ==
The story was inspired by the works of the occultist Paracelsus, who coined the term &quot;undine&quot; (from Lithuanian language word Vandene (water=vanduo)). Paracelsus&#x27;s &quot;Book on Nymphs&quot; states that undines can gain an immortal soul by marrying a human. It mentions the French legend of Melusine, in which a water-spirit marries a knight on condition that he shall never see her on Saturdays, when she resumes her mermaid shape, and the German story of &quot;Peter von Staufenberg&quot;, in which a fairy kills her human lover when he marries another woman.

Fouqué may have been more directly influenced by the &quot;Comte de Gabalis&quot;, a Rosicrucian novel which adapted Paracelsus&#x27;s ideas. Another model was probably the 1798 opera &quot;Das Donauweibchen&quot;, whichlike &quot;Undine&quot;is set around the Danube and features a love triangle between a man, a woman, and a water nymph.

== Success and influence ==
During the nineteenth century the book was very popular and was, according to &quot;The Times&quot; in 1843, &quot;a book which, of all others, if you ask for it at a foreign library, you are sure to find engaged&quot;. 

An unabridged English translation of the story by William Leonard Courtney and illustrated by Arthur Rackham was published in 1909. George MacDonald thought &quot;Undine&quot; &quot;the most beautiful&quot; of all fairy stories, while Lafcadio Hearn referred to &quot;Undine&quot; as a &quot;fine German story&quot; in his essay &quot;The Value of the Supernatural in Fiction&quot;. The references to &quot;Undine&quot; in such works as Charlotte Mary Yonge&#x27;s &quot;The Daisy Chain&quot; and Louisa Alcott&#x27;s &quot;Little Women&quot; show that it was one of the best loved of all books for many 19th-century children.

The first adaptation of &quot;Undine&quot; was E. T. A. Hoffmann&#x27;s opera in 1816. It was a collaboration between Hoffmann, who composed the score, and Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué who adapted his own work into a libretto. The opera proved highly successful, and Carl Maria von Weber praised it in his review as the kind of composition which the German desires: &quot;an art work complete in itself, in which partial contributions of the related and collaborating arts blend together, disappear, and, in disappearing, somehow form a new world&quot;.

In the 1830s, the novella was translated into Russian dactylic hexameter verse by the Romantic poet Vasily Zhukovsky. This verse translation became a classic in its own right and later provided the basis for the libretto to Tchaikovsky&#x27;s operatic adaptation. The novella has since inspired numerous similar adaptions in various genres and traditions.

Hans Christian Andersen was influenced by the portrayal of souls in &quot;Undine&quot; while writing &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. In one of his letters he stated, &quot;I have not, like de la Motte Fouqué in Undine, allowed the mermaid&#x27;s acquiring of an immortal soul to depend upon an alien creature, upon the love of a human being. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s wrong! It would depend rather much on chance, wouldn&#x27;t it? I won&#x27;t accept that sort of thing in this world. I have permitted my mermaid to follow a more natural, more divine path.&quot;

The breathing disorder known as central hypoventilation syndrome, when first identified in 1962, was nicknamed &quot;Ondine&#x27;s curse&quot;. This was based on a scene in Jean Giraudoux&#x27;s 1938 play adaptation, &quot;Ondine&quot;, in which the dying love interest describes his difficulty breathing. Medical literature frequently misunderstood the play and thus confused the symptoms of the disorder, leading to criticism of the name.&quot;&quot;

<doc id="484851" wikidata="Q532549" url="?curid=484851" title="London Knights">
<text>The London Knights are a junior ice hockey team from London, Ontario, Canada, playing in the Ontario Hockey League, one of the leagues of the Canadian Hockey League. The Knights started out in 1965 as the London Nationals but changed to their current name in 1968. The Knights have won two Memorial Cup championships.

==History==

===Early days===
The London Nationals were granted a franchise in the OHA for the 1965–66 season under the ownership of the London Gardens arena, with the Toronto Maple Leafs controlling the team&#x27;s players.

After three seasons, direct NHL sponsorship of junior teams ended. The team and Gardens was sold to businessman Howard Darwin for $500,000, who renamed the team to the Knights and changed the colours to green and gold.

===1968–1986: the Darwin era===
In 1968, businessman Howard Darwin bought the London Nationals (he also owned the Ottawa 67&#x27;s) as the era of NHL sponsorship of junior hockey ended. Darwin wanted to give a fresh look to the team, and so held a contest to rename the team.

===1986–1994: new owners, new dawn===
In 1986 Howard Darwin sold the Knights and the arena to Paris, Ontario businessmen Jack Robillard, Al Martin and Bob Willson.

===1994–2000: &quot;Knightmare&quot; and redemption===
In 1994 the Knights were sold to St. Thomas, Ontario, real estate developer Doug Tarry Sr. He died before the team had played a game under his ownership, and the team was inherited by his son, Doug Tarry Jr. Upon taking command, Tarry carried out further renovations on the Gardens including a name change to the &quot;London Ice House.&quot; He also alienated a fair portion of the team&#x27;s fan base by changing the team&#x27;s colours from green, gold and black to eggplant and teal, and changing the logo to a cartoon logo instantly and derisively nicknamed &quot;Spiderknight&quot;.

===2000–present: the Hunter era===
In 2000, former NHL players Dale Hunter, Mark Hunter, and Basil McRae bought the Knights from Doug Tarry Jr.

The 2003–04 OHL season would mark the beginning of a remarkable dynasty. The Knights had the best regular season record in the CHL and set an OHL record with 110 points, but lost the OHL Western Conference final to the Guelph Storm. In the 2004–05 season, the Knights set a new CHL record by going 31 games in a row without a loss (29–0–2).
The Knights finished the season with 120 points (59 wins, 7 losses, 2 ties), breaking their own OHL record set the previous season. In the playoffs, the Knights started by sweeping two best-of-seven series against the Guelph Storm and Windsor Spitfires. In the Western Conference final, the Knights defeated the Kitchener Rangers 4–1 to win the Wayne Gretzky Trophy. In the OHL finals against the Ottawa 67&#x27;s, the Knights won the series 4–1 to win their first J. Ross Robertson Cup, ending the longest championship drought in the CHL. The London Knights qualified for the 2005 Memorial Cup both as OHL Champion and the tournament host. In the tournament round robin, they defeated the Rimouski Océanic 4–3, the Kelowna Rockets 4–2, and the Ottawa 67&#x27;s 5–2. This earned the Knights a bye into the championship game in which they defeated Rimouski 4–0 to win their first Memorial Cup. In 2018, the 2004–05 London Knights were named the CHL&#x27;s &quot;Team of the Century&quot;.

Dale Hunter announced on May 14, 2012, he would not return to coach the Capitals in the 2012–13 season, choosing instead to return to the London Knights.

The Knights capped their OHL season with a game seven win over the Barrie Colts as Bo Horvat scored the game-winning goal in the last second of the third period to capture the Knights&#x27; second consecutive J. Ross Robertson Cup.

London finished the 2013–14 season third in the OHL with 103 regular season points. However, the only two teams above them were their division opponents, the Guelph Storm and Erie Otters, thus denying the Knights a third straight division title. After sweeping the Windsor Spitfires in the first round the Knights were eliminated by the Storm in five games. Nevertheless, the Knights earned a berth in the 2014 Memorial Cup, their third straight, by virtue of being selected to host the tournament the day after winning the OHL championship the year before.

On October 21, 2014, Mark Hunter resigned as Knights general manager after being appointed director of player personnel for the Toronto Maple Leafs.

The Knights entered the 2016 Memorial Cup as favourites due to their impressive winning streak and did not disappoint, dominating the round robin and outscoring their opponents by a combined score of 20–5. In the championship game, the Knights faced off against the CHL number-one ranked Rouyn-Noranda Huskies. The Huskies pushed the Knights to the limit, carrying a 2–1 lead late into the third period before Christian Dvorak scored with 4:11 remaining to force overtime, where a goal by Matthew Tkachuk earned the Knights their 17th-straight win and second Memorial Cup championship.

On July 6, 2016, McRae stepped down as general manager of the London Knights to become the director of player personnel for the Columbus Blue Jackets. He was replaced by former assistant general manager and former assistant coach of the London Knights, Rob Simpson.

The Knights subsequently finished the 2016–17 OHL season third in the Midwest. In the playoffs, they defeated the Windsor Spitfires in seven games before falling to the Erie Otters in seven games in the second round.

Having resigned from his role with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Mark Hunter returned as general manager of the London Knights on August 10, 2018, with Rob Simpson returning to his former role as assistant general manager.

Notes: Mike Fedorko was entering his second season as Knights&#x27; coach and GM in the autumn of 1995. He was fired in October 1995 when the Knights began the season with a 13-game losing streak. Assistant Murray Nystrom took over coaching duties temporarily. Tom Barrett, who had led the Kitchener Rangers to the 1984 Memorial Cup, was named head coach in December. Barrett died of cancer in April 1996, shortly after the conclusion of the season. Moe Mantha was originally named the head coach to take over from Barrett, but left to coach the Baltimore Bandits of the American Hockey League before coaching a game. Brad Selwood was ultimately named Barrett&#x27;s replacement for 1996–97 but was fired mid-season and GM Paul McIntosh took over on an interim basis for the rest of the season. Gary Agnew was rehired at the start of 1997–98.

==Arenas==

The London Gardens was built in 1963 and served as the home of the Knights from the team&#x27;s inception in 1965 to its closing in 2002. The building was renamed &quot;London Ice House&quot; in 1994. The Knights final game played at the arena was in the 2002 playoffs, where the Knights lost in overtime in the sixth game of the second round to the eventual OHL Champion Erie Otters. The Knights used the Ice House for their training camp and exhibition schedule for the 2002–03 season and moved out permanently in October 2002.

The Canada Life Place opened on October 11, 2002 as the Knights played host to the Plymouth Whalers. The arena, located in downtown London, is the largest in Western Ontario.

<text>IJ (lowercase ij; ; also encountered as Unicode compatibility characters Ĳ and ĳ) is a digraph of the letters &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;. Occurring in the Dutch language, it is sometimes considered a ligature, or a letter in itself. In most fonts that have a separate character for &quot;ij&quot;, the two composing parts are not connected but are separate glyphs, which are sometimes slightly kerned.

An &quot;ij&quot; in written Dutch usually represents the diphthong , similar to the pronunciation of in &quot;pay&quot;. In standard Dutch and most Dutch dialects, there are two possible spellings for the diphthong : &quot;ij&quot; and &quot;ei&quot;, with no clear usage rules. To distinguish between the two, the &quot;ij&quot; is referred to as the (&quot;long &quot;ij&quot;&quot;), the &quot;ei&quot; as (&quot;short &quot;ei&quot;&quot;) or simply &quot;E – I&quot;. In certain Dutch dialects (notably West Flemish and Zeelandic) and the Dutch Low Saxon dialects of Low German, a difference in the pronunciation of &quot;ei&quot; and &quot;ij&quot; is maintained. Whether it is pronounced identically to &quot;ei&quot; or not, the pronunciation of &quot;ij&quot; is often perceived as being difficult by people who do not have either sound in their native language.

The &quot;ij&quot; originally represented a &#x27;long i&#x27;. It used to be written as &quot;ii&quot;, as in Finnish and Estonian, but for orthographic purposes, the second &quot;i&quot; was eventually elongated, which is a reason why it is called . This can still be seen in the pronunciation of some words like (), and the etymology of some words in the Dutch form of several foreign placenames: Berlin and Paris are spelled and . Nowadays, the pronunciation mostly follows the spelling, and they are pronounced with . The &quot;ij&quot; is distinct from the letter &quot;y&quot;. Particularly when writing capitals, Y used to be common instead of IJ in the past. That practice has long been deprecated, since 1804, and the standard Dutch alphabet has the letter &quot;ij&quot; in the alphabet between the &quot;x&quot; and the &quot;z&quot;. The letter &quot;y&quot; is not part of the Dutch alphabet, but commonly used in loan words and archaic names. In scientific disciplines such as mathematics and physics, the symbol &quot;y&quot; is usually pronounced &quot;ij&quot;.

To distinguish the &quot;Y&quot; from &quot;IJ&quot; in common speech, however, &quot;Y&quot; is often called (meaning &quot;Greek &quot;Y&quot;), a literal translation of &quot; (from French, with the stress on &quot;grec&quot;: ) or alternatively called &quot;Ypsilon&quot;. In modern Dutch, the letter &quot;Y&quot; occurs only in loanwords, proper nouns, or when deliberately spelled as Early Modern Dutch. The spelling of Afrikaans (a daughter language of early modern Dutch) has evolved in the exact opposite direction and &quot;IJ&quot; has been completely replaced by &quot;Y&quot;. 

However, the ancient use of Y in Dutch has survived in some personal names, particularly those of Dutch immigrants in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand where as a result of anglicization, the &quot;IJ&quot; became a &quot;Y&quot;. For example, the surname &quot;&quot; was often changed into &quot;Spyker&quot; and &quot;Snijder&quot; into &quot;Snyder&quot;.



==History==

&quot;IJ&quot; probably developed out of &quot;ii&quot;, representing a long sound (which it still does in some cases, such as in the word &quot;&quot; and in several Dutch dialects). In the Middle Ages, the &quot;i&quot; was written without a dot in handwriting, and the combination &quot;ıı&quot; was often confused with &quot;u&quot;. Therefore, the second &quot;i&quot; was elongated: &quot;ıȷ&quot;. Later, the dots were added, albeit not in Afrikaans, a language that has its roots in Dutch. In this language &quot;y&quot; is used instead.

Alternatively, the letter J may have developed as a swash form of &quot;i&quot;. In other European languages it was first used for the final &quot;i&quot; in Roman numerals when there was more than one &quot;i&quot; in a row, such as &quot;iij&quot; for &quot;three&quot;, to prevent the fraudulent addition of an extra &quot;i&quot; to change the number. In Dutch, which had a native &quot;ii&quot;, the &quot;final &quot;i&quot; in a row elongated&quot; rule was applied as well, leading to &quot;ij&quot;.

Another theory is that &quot;IJ&quot; might have arisen from the lowercase &quot;y&quot; being split into two strokes in handwriting. At some time in the 15th or 16th century, this combination began to be spelled as a ligature &quot;ij&quot;. An argument against this theory is that even in handwriting which does not join letters, &quot;ij&quot; is often written as a single sign.

Some time after the birth of this new letter, the sound which was now represented by &quot;ij&quot;, in most cases, began to be pronounced much like &quot;ei&quot; instead, but words containing it were still spelled the same. Nowadays, &quot;ij&quot; in most cases represents the diphthong , except in the suffix &quot;-lijk&quot;, where it is usually pronounced as a schwa. In one special case, the Dutch word &quot;bijzonder&quot;, the (old) sound is correct standard pronunciation, although is more common and is also allowed.

In proper names, &quot;ij&quot; often appears instead of &quot;i&quot; at the end of other diphthongs, where it does not affect the pronunciation: &quot;aaij&quot;, &quot;eij&quot;, &quot;oeij&quot;, &quot;ooij&quot; and &quot;uij&quot; are pronounced identically to &quot;aai&quot; , &quot;ei&quot; , &quot;oei&quot; , &quot;ooi&quot; and &quot;ui&quot; . This derives from an old orthographic practice (also seen in older French and German) of writing &quot;y&quot; instead of &quot;i&quot; after another vowel; later, when &quot;y&quot; and &quot;ij&quot; came to be seen as interchangeable, the spellings with &quot;ij&quot; came to be used. Spelling reforms and standardization have removed the redundant &quot;j&quot;s in common words, but proper names continue to use these archaic spellings.

==Status==
As the rules of usage for the &quot;IJ&quot; differ from those that apply to the many other digraphs in the Dutch language—in some situations behaving more as a single ligature or letter than a digraph—the &quot;IJ&quot; is not only confusing to foreigners, but also a source of discussion among native speakers of Dutch. Its actual usage in the Netherlands and in Flanders (Belgium) sometimes differs from the official recommendations.

===Official status===
Both the Dutch Language Union and the consider the &quot;ij&quot; to be a digraph of the letters &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;. The descriptive dictionary &quot;Van Dale Groot woordenboek van de Nederlandse taal&quot; states that &quot;ij&quot; is a &quot;letter combination consisting of the signs i and j, used, in some words, to represent the diphthong ɛi.&quot; The &quot;Winkler Prins&quot; encyclopedia states that &quot;ij&quot; is the 25th letter of the Dutch alphabet, placed between &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;. 
However, this definition is not generally accepted.

In words where &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; are in different syllables, they do not form the digraph &quot;ij&quot;. In compound words, a hyphen is added, as in &quot;gummi-jas&quot;.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, &quot;IJ&quot; is often used as a ligature:

* In Dutch primary schools, &quot;ij&quot; used to be taught as being the 25th letter of the alphabet, and some primary school writing materials still list it as such. However, &quot;ij&quot; is according to Onze Taal not part of the Dutch alphabet and is usually sorted under the &quot;i&quot; as it is considered to consist of two letters.
* When a word starting with &quot;IJ&quot; is capitalised, the entire digraph is capitalised: , .
* On mechanical Dutch typewriters, there is a key that produces &#x27;ij&#x27; (in a single letterspace, located directly to the right of the &quot;L&quot;). However, this is not the case on modern computer keyboards.
* In many word puzzles, such as Lingo, &quot;ij&quot; fills one square, but in others, such as Scrabble, &quot;ij&quot; fills two squares.

===Flanders===
In Flanders (Belgium), &quot;IJ&quot; is generally described in schools as a combination of two separate characters.

* As in the Netherlands, words that begin with &quot;IJ&quot; (and that are the first word in a sentence) usually capitalise the entire pair: &quot;IJzer&quot;, &quot;IJzertoren&quot;.

==Usage==

===Capitalisation===
When a Dutch word starting with &quot;IJ&quot; is capitalised, the entire digraph is capitalised, as in &quot;IJsselmeer&quot; or &quot;IJmuiden&quot;.

Support for this property in software is limited. Poorly localised text editors with autocorrect functionality may incorrectly convert the second of two initial capital letters in a word to lowercase; such improper spelling can thus be found in informal writing. Support on the internet is similarly inconsistent: Web pages styled with the CSS property codice_1 are specified to be handled with Unicode language-specific case mapping rules (content language being indicated with HTML language attributes, such as codice_2 for Dutch), but support for language-specific cases is limited to Mozilla Firefox (version 14 and above) .

===Collation===
Dutch dictionaries since about 1850 invariably sort &quot;ij&quot; as an &quot;i&quot; followed by a &quot;j&quot;, i.e. between &quot;ih&quot; and &quot;ik&quot;. This is the preferred sorting by the Taalunie. On the other hand, some encyclopedias, like the &quot;Winkler Prins&quot;, 7th edition, sort &quot;ij&quot; as a single letter positioned between &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.

Telephone directories as well as the Yellow Pages in the Netherlands (but not those in Belgium) sort &quot;ij&quot; and &quot;y&quot; together, as if they were the same, between &quot;x&quot; and &quot;z&quot;. Thanks to this, surnames like &quot;Bruijn&quot; and &quot;Bruyn&quot; which sound the same (and even look similar), can be found in the same area. However, &quot;Bruin&quot;, though it sounds the same as well, is placed with &quot;Brui-&quot; and not with &quot;Bruy-&quot;.

===Abbreviations===
When words or (first) names are shortened to their initials, in the Netherlands a word or proper name starting with &quot;IJ&quot; is abbreviated to &quot;IJ&quot;. For example, &quot;IJsbrand Eises Ypma&quot; is shortened to &quot;IJ. E. Ypma&quot;. The digraph &quot;ei&quot; in &quot;Eises&quot;, like other digraphs in Dutch, is shortened to one letter.

===Stress===

In Dutch orthography, &quot;ad hoc&quot; indication of stress can be marked by placing an acute accent on the vowel of the stressed syllable. In case of a diphthong or double vowel, both vowels should be marked with an acute accent; this also applies to the &quot;IJ&quot; (even though &quot;J&quot; by itself is not a vowel, the digraph &quot;IJ&quot; represents one distinct vowel sound). However, due to technical limitations the accent on the &quot;j&quot; is often omitted in electronic documents: &quot;&quot;. Nevertheless, in Unicode it is possible to combine characters into a &quot;j&quot; with an acute accent — &quot;&quot; — though this might not be supported or rendered correctly by some fonts or systems. This &quot;j́&quot; is the combination of the regular (soft-dotted) &quot;j&quot; (U+006A) and the combining acute accent  ́ (U+0301).

===Spelling===
 can be spelled out in two ways, depending on whether the speller considers &quot;ij&quot; to be one letter or not:

* &quot;V – R – IJ – D – A – G&quot;
* &quot;V – R – I – J – D – A – G&quot;

===Wide inter-letter spacing===
When words are written with large inter-letter spacing, &quot;IJ&quot; is often, but not always, kept together. &quot;F r a n k r ij k&quot; or &quot;F r a n k r i j k&quot;.

When words are written from top to bottom, with non-rotated letters, &quot;IJ&quot; is usually, but not always, kept together. Keeping it together is the preferred way.

===Spelling of proper names===
In Dutch names, interchangeability of &quot;i&quot;, &quot;ij&quot; and &quot;y&quot; is frequent. Some names are changed unofficially for commercial reasons or by indifference:

* Johan Cruijff/Cruyff, former football player and manager
* Ruud van Nistelrooij/Nistelrooy, football player
* Piet Heijn/Heyn/Hein, a Dutch West India Company admiral
* Dirk Kuijt/Kuyt, football player
* Arie Luijendijk/Luyendyk, race-driver
* Spijker/Spyker, car manufacturer
* Anner Bijlsma/Bylsma, cellist

The Dutch football team of Feyenoord changed its name from the original &quot; to &quot; after achieving international successes. This was done as a reaction to foreign people often mispronouncing the name. The Feijenoord district in Rotterdam, the namesake of the football club maintains its original spelling.

===Phonetic radio alphabet===
In the Dutch phonetic radio alphabet, the codeword represents the &quot;IJ&quot;. This is clearly different from the codeword &quot;Ypsilon&quot;, which is used to represent the &quot;Y&quot;. Dutch and Belgian armed forces use the official NATO phonetic alphabet, where &quot;Y&quot; is &quot;Yankee&quot; and &quot;IJ&quot; is spelled out &quot;India Juliett&quot;.

===Word games===
In crossword puzzles (except for Scrabble – see next paragraph), and in the game Lingo, &quot;IJ&quot; is considered one letter, filling one square, but the &quot;IJ&quot; and the &quot;Y&quot; are considered distinct. In other word games, the rules may vary.

The Dutch version of Scrabble has a &quot;Y&quot; with a face value of eight. Some players used it to represent &quot;IJ&quot; or &quot;Y&quot;. The recent Dutch version comes with an example game, which clearly indicates that &quot;Y&quot; is only &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;IJ&quot; should be composed of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;J&quot;. In previous editions of Scrabble there was a single IJ sign.

In word games that make a distinction between vowels and consonants, &quot;IJ&quot; is considered to be a vowel, if it is considered one letter. Whether &quot;Y&quot; is a vowel or a consonant, is another matter of discussion, since &quot;Y&quot; can represent both a vowel or a (half-) consonant.

==Technical details==
===Print and handwriting===

In print, the letter &quot;ÿ&quot; (lowercase y with diaeresis) and &quot;ij&quot; look very different, but handwriting usually makes &quot;ÿ&quot;, &quot;ij&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;IJ&quot; look identical. However, since &quot;y&quot; occurs only in loanwords, the letter &quot;ÿ&quot; is extremely rare (if not altogether nonexistent) in Dutch.

The &quot;long ij&quot; extends below the baseline and so is written with a long stroke. It is often written as a single sign, even in handwriting that does not join letters.

On some road signs in the Netherlands, &quot;IJ&quot; appears as a single glyph formed like a &quot;U&quot; with a break in the left-hand stroke.

===Braille===
Dutch Braille, which is used in the Netherlands, has represented by , which represents in other varieties of Braille. is written as .

In Belgium, French Braille is used, in which is written simply as + : .

===Encoding===
The Dutch &quot;ij&quot; is not present in the ASCII code, nor in any of the ISO 8859 character encodings. Therefore, the digraph is most often encoded as an &quot;i&quot; followed by a &quot;j&quot;. The ligature is present as a national-use character within the Dutch version of ISO 646, one implementation of which is of DEC&#x27;s National Replacement Character Set (NRCS) aka code page 1102, and it also existed in the Atari ST character set (but not in the GEM character set for PCs) as well as in the Lotus Multi-Byte Character Set (LMBCS). It is also present in Unicode in the Latin Extended-A range as and . These characters are considered compatibility-decomposable. They are included for compatibility and round-trip convertibility with legacy encodings, but their use is discouraged. Therefore, even with Unicode available, it is recommended to encode &quot;ij&quot; as two separate letters. Nonetheless, some fonts use this code point for the ligated form of IJ if it exists.

===Keyboards===
While Dutch typewriters usually have a separate key for lowercase &quot;ij&quot;, Belgian typewriters do not. In the Netherlands, a QWERTY computer keyboard layout is common. The standard US layout (often in &quot;International Mode&quot;) is widely used, although a specific but rarely used Dutch variant (KBD143) does exist. In Belgium, a specific Belgian variant of AZERTY keyboard layout (KBD120) is widely used. None of these keyboards feature a key for &quot;ij&quot; or &quot;IJ&quot;.

==Not as a digraph==
If the &quot;i&quot; and the &quot;j&quot; belong to different syllables, such as in the mathematical term (syllablised &quot;bi‧jec‧tie&quot;), words with old spelling (syllablised &quot;mi‧ni‧jurk&quot;), (syllablised &quot;ski‧jas&quot;), foreign placenames like , , or person names like , , , they do not form a ligature or a single letter. Earlier statements about sorting &quot;ij&quot; on par with &quot;y&quot;, keeping &quot;ij&quot; together in the kerning of printed texts, the single square in crossword puzzles, etc., do not apply.

<text>Chatterton’s compound is an adhesive waterproof insulating compound that was used in early submarine telegraph cables. It was patented in 1859 by John Chatterton and Willoughby Smith.

Its constitution is as follows: 
*3 parts gutta-percha
*1 part rosin
*1 part Stockholm tar

Chatterton&#x27;s Compound was also used to stick insulating paper to armatures, for example those on Synchronome clocks, which were the most accurate clocks made in the early part of the 20th century. If the paper appeared to be in bad condition it could be removed by warming up the armature near a flame and replacing it.

Chatterton&#x27;s Compound was used in the manufacture of pneumatic pipe organs to seal lead tubing into wooden blocks for the pneumatic action, or, particularly in the UK, to affix reed weights to the reed tongues. It is still used in historical restoration jobs for this purpose but has been replaced with modern materials on more recent builds.

Chatterton&#x27;s Compound was much used by submarine cable technicians for various purposes around oversea telegraph offices prior to the 1960s; it could be used as an adhesive or in jointing gutta-percha-insulated submarine telegraph cables. It was available in round black sticks of about 3/4 inch diameter which responded to heat from a spirit lamp. It was known to telegraph technicians as &#x27;chats&#x27;.

In France, the normal black PVC electrical insulating tape is often referred to as &quot;chatterton&quot;.

<text>Guacamole (; informally shortened to &quot;guac&quot; in the United States since the 1980s) is an avocado-based dip, spread, or salad first developed in Mexico. In addition to its use in modern Mexican cuisine, it has become part of international cuisine as a dip, condiment, and salad ingredient.

== Etymology and pronunciation ==

The name comes from Classical Nahuatl , which literally translates to &#x27;avocado sauce&#x27;, from &quot;āhuacatl&quot; &#x27;avocado&#x27; + &quot;mōlli&quot; &#x27;sauce&#x27; or &#x27;mole&#x27;. In Mexican Spanish, it is pronounced . In American English, it tends to be pronounced . British English also uses this pronunciation, but is more common.

== History ==
Avocado seeds were first found in the Tehuacan Valley of Mexico around 9,000–10,000 years ago (7000–8000 BCE) and had been domesticated by various Mesoamerican groups by 5000 BCE. They were likely cultivated in the Supe Valley in Peru as early as 3100 BCE. In the early 1900s, avocados frequently went by the name &quot;alligator pear&quot;. In the 1697 book, &quot;A New Voyage Round the World&quot;, the first known description of a guacamole recipe (though not known by that name) was by English privateer and naturalist William Dampier, who in his visit to Central America during one of his circumnavigations, noted a native preparation made of grinding together avocados, sugar, and lime juice.

Guacamole has increased avocado sales in the U.S., especially on Super Bowl Sunday and Cinco de Mayo. The rising consumption of guacamole is most likely due to the U.S. government lifting a ban on avocado imports in the 1990s and the growth of the U.S. Latino population.

== Ingredients and preparation ==
Guacamole is traditionally made by mashing peeled, ripe avocados and salt with a &quot;molcajete y tejolote&quot; (mortar and pestle). Recipes often call for lime juice, cilantro, onions, and jalapeños. Some non-traditional recipes may call for sour cream, tomatoes, basil, or peas.

Due to the presence of polyphenol oxidase in the cells of avocado, exposure to oxygen in the air causes an enzymatic reaction and develops melanoidin pigment, turning the sauce brown. This result is generally considered unappetizing, and there are several methods (some anecdotal) that are used to counter this effect, such as storing the guacamole in an air-tight container or wrapping tightly in plastic to limit the surface area exposed to the air.

== Composition and nutrients ==
As the major ingredient of guacamole is raw avocado, the nutritional value of the dish derives from avocado vitamins, minerals and fats, providing dietary fibre, several B vitamins, vitamin K, vitamin E and potassium in significant content (see Daily Value percentages in nutrient table for avocado). Avocados are a source of saturated fat, monounsaturated fat and phytosterols, such as beta-sitosterol. They also contain carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, zeaxanthin and lutein.

== Similar dishes==

=== &quot;Mantequilla de pobre&quot; ===
 is a mixture of avocado, tomato, oil, and citrus juice. Despite its name, it predates the arrival of dairy cattle in the Americas, and thus was not originally made as a butter substitute.

=== &quot;Guasacaca&quot; ===
Thinner and more acidic, or thick and chunky, &quot;guasacaca&quot; is a Venezuelan avocado-based sauce; it is made with vinegar, and is served over &quot;parrillas&quot; (grilled food), &quot;arepas&quot;, &quot;empanadas&quot;, and various other dishes. It is common to make the &quot;guasacaca&quot; with a little hot sauce instead of &quot;jalapeño&quot;, but like a guacamole, it is not usually served as a hot sauce itself. It is pronounced &quot;wasakaka&quot; in Latin America.

=== &quot;Guacamole falso&quot; ===
Substitute ingredients are sometimes used in place of avocados to produce a thick green sauce called &quot;guacamole falso&quot; (fake guacamole). Common substitutes include summer squash, green tomatoes and oil-fried jalapeños.

== Commercial products ==
Prepared guacamoles are available in stores, often available refrigerated, frozen or in high pressure packaging which pasteurizes and extends shelf life if products are maintained at .

== Holiday ==

National Guacamole Day is celebrated on the same day as Mexican Independence Day, September 16.

== In popular culture ==

On November 20, 2022, Municipo de Peribán, Mexico achieved the Guinness World Records for the largest serving of guacamole. The serving weighed 4,972 kg (10,961 lb) and had 500 people help prepare it.

<text>Dorkbot is a group of affiliated organizations worldwide that sponsor grassroots meetings of artists, engineers, designers, scientists, inventors, and anyone else working under the very broad umbrella of electronic art. The dorkbot motto is &quot;people doing strange things with electricity&quot;.

Started by Douglas Repetto at the Columbia University Computer Music Center in 2000, dorkbot spread around the world, with over 100 chapters either planning or actively holding meetings as of 2010. In 2012, a series of viruses with the same name appeared and it caused many of the chapters to disband.

The purpose of dorkbot meetings is to nurture a local electronic arts community and to encourage emerging, and established, artists to present new works for informal peer review. While many of the dorkbot groups hold their meetings at universities and students are encouraged to attend, dorkbot meetings are not restricted in any way to the academic community. Dorkbot groups encourage the free exchange of ideas on the electronic arts, and regular attendees of one dorkbot will often visit another when they are travelling, serving as informal ambassadors between groups.

<doc id="484876" wikidata="Q743292" url="?curid=484876" title="The War Room">
<text>The War Room is a 1993 American documentary film about Bill Clinton&#x27;s campaign for President of the United States during the 1992 United States presidential election. Directed by Chris Hegedus and D. A. Pennebaker, the film was released on December 5, 1993. It was eventually nominated for the Best Documentary Feature Academy Award.

==Synopsis==
The film follows James Carville and George Stephanopoulos, at first during the New Hampshire primary, and then mostly in Little Rock, Arkansas, at the Clinton campaign headquarters. Several key events of the 1992 election cycle and their repercussions within the Clinton campaign are chronicled in the documentary. These include: the Gennifer Flowers scandal, the New Hampshire Democratic primary, Ross Perot&#x27;s campaign as an Independent, the Democratic National Convention, the Clinton campaign&#x27;s attack on George H. W. Bush&#x27;s &quot;Read my lips: no new taxes&quot; statement from 1988, the presidential debates, and the night of the general election.

Much of the film focuses on the interaction between politics and the media and the attempts by the Clinton and Bush campaigns to spin public perception of events and news stories.

===People===
The primary figures in the film are:
*Bill Clinton, 1992 Democratic Party presidential candidate and 42nd Governor of Arkansas
*James Carville, Clinton&#x27;s lead strategist
*George Stephanopoulos, Clinton&#x27;s communications director

Though Carville and Stephanopoulos are the film&#x27;s main figures, many other prominent figures in the campaign make appearances, including Paul Begala, Dee Dee Myers, Mandy Grunwald, Bob Boorstin, Stan Greenberg, Mickey Kantor, Harold Ickes, and Bush&#x27;s deputy campaign manager Mary Matalin, who was in a relationship with Carville during the campaign (they married in 1993). Clinton campaign manager David Wilhelm was extended an invitation to participate, but declined. Additionally, Rahm Emanuel, the future White House Chief of Staff to President Barack Obama and Mayor of Chicago, can be seen in some scenes as a finance director for the Clinton campaign. Also featured are Clinton&#x27;s general election rivals George H. W. Bush and Ross Perot, and his Democratic primary rivals Paul Tsongas and Jerry Brown.

==Production==
Shortly before the 1992 Democratic National Convention, novice producers R.J. Cutler and Wendy Ettinger approached filmmakers D. A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus about making a documentary about the then-ongoing 1992 U.S. presidential election. Pennebaker and Hegedus expressed interest, provided the producers could get them permission to film what they would need to film, so Cutler and Ettinger contacted the Bush, Perot, and Clinton campaigns. Only the Clinton campaign was open to giving the filmmakers any access, and this was limited primarily to Carville and Stephanopoulos and events that transpired within the so-called &quot;war room&quot; at the campaign&#x27;s national headquarters in Little Rock, Arkansas, so the scope of the film narrowed from encompassing the entire election to mostly centering around one room. Events in the election cycle that occurred before the Democratic National Convention were covered in the completed documentary through montages of newspaper headlines, the use of clips from TV news programs, and, according to Hegedus, unused footage from Kevin Rafferty&#x27;s &quot;Feed&quot;, a documentary about the 1992 New Hampshire primary.

Over a span of four months spent filming, Pennebaker and Hegedus shot about 35 hours of film.

==2008 Democratic primary controversy==
In late April 2008, a clip from the film was posted on YouTube that purported to show former Clinton administration official (and supporter of then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton) Mickey Kantor saying to Carville and Stephanopoulos, &quot;Look at Indiana, wait, wait – look at Indiana. 42-40. It doesn’t matter if we win. Those people are shit. Excuse me.&quot; Another erroneous interpretation of the clip alleged that Kantor said, &quot;How would you like to be a worthless white nigger?&quot;.

On May 2, 2008, Kantor claimed that the footage had been doctored, and shortly thereafter D.A. Pennebaker claimed that Kantor had actually said &quot;Those people must be shitting in the White House.&quot; The doctored footage and false allegations against Kantor were discussed in the &quot;Return of the War Room&quot;, a 2008 sequel made by Pennebaker and Hegedus.

==Reception and legacy==
===Box office===
As it was screened at only a few locations, the film grossed $901,668 at the box office.

===Critical reception===
The film received near universal acclaim from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 96% &quot;fresh&quot; rating based on 24 reviews, with an average rating of 8.11/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Eye-opening in its access to an array of colorful campaign operatives, &quot;The War Room&quot; is a valuable time capsule and a riveting study in the art of politicking.&quot;

===Accolades===
*66th Academy Awards
:Nominated for Best Documentary Feature (1994)
*National Board of Review of Motion Pictures
:Won Special Recognition in Filmmaking (1996)
:Won Award for Best Documentary (1993)

<doc id="484881" wikidata="Q210872" url="?curid=484881" title="Ganges river dolphin">
<text>The Ganges river dolphin (Platanista gangetica) is a species of freshwater dolphin classified in the family Platanistidae. It lives in the Ganges and related rivers of South Asia, namely in the countries of India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. It is related to the much smaller Indus river dolphin which lives in the Indus River in Pakistan and the Beas River of northwestern India.

It is also known by the name susu (popular name) also shihu () in Assam and shushuk () in West Bengal and Bangladesh. The Ganges river dolphin has been recognized by the Government of India as its National Aquatic Animal and is the official animal of the Indian city of Guwahati. Its first occurrence, within the Hooghly River, was documented by William Roxburgh.

== Description ==

The Ganges river dolphin has a rectangular, ridgelike dorsal fin and females tend to be larger than males. Ganges river dolphins usually are tan, chocolate brown, dark grey or light blue. They have an elongated, slender snout with sharp and very pointed teeth, similar to most river dolphins. The river dolphin has a rounded belly which, combined with their rectangular dorsal fin, makes them look particularly stocky in build compared to other dolphins. Their flippers and tail flukes are large and broad. They have a large melon head used for echolocation, because they cannot see well. Their eyes are usually small due to the cloudy water. Ganges river dolphins are usually 2.2–2.6 meters long (7–8 ft). The oldest recorded animal was a 28-year-old male, 199 cm in length, although they are estimated to live up to 30 years old.

== Taxonomy ==
The Ganges river dolphin split from the Indus river dolphin during the Pleistocene, around 550,000 years ago. The earliest fossil identified as belonging to the species is only 12,000 years old.

The Ganges river dolphin was formally classified as &quot;Delphinus gangeticus&quot; two separate times in 1801, by Heinrich Julius Lebeck and William Roxburgh. They both likely used the type specimen, caught near Calcutta in late 1797 and sent to the Hunterian Museum in London. It may have been destroyed during World War II, but castings were previously made of the rostrum and parts of the lower jaw, which survive at the Natural History Museum. Whether Lebeck or Roxburgh should be given credit has been debated over the centuries, but research by Kinze (2000) found that Lebeck&#x27;s description was published on the 24 August while Roxburgh&#x27;s was likely published no earlier than September, thus giving Lebeck the priority. Elisha Gray coined the species name &quot; Platanista gangetica&quot; in 1835.

This species and the Indus river dolphin, were initially classified as a single species, &quot;Platanista gangetica&quot;, but in the 1970s both were split into distinct species. However, in the 1990s, both species were again grouped as a single species. However, more recent studies of genes, divergence time, and skull structure support both being distinct species.

== Etymology ==

The species has multiple common names throughout its range. It is known as &quot;susu&quot; as a popular name, &quot;soons, soans&quot;, or &quot;soos&quot; in Hindi, &quot;shushuk&quot; in Bengali, &quot;hiho&quot; or &quot;hihu&quot; in Assamese, &quot;bhagirath&quot; (as a reference to the character of the same name from Hindu mythology), and &quot;shus&quot; or &quot;suongsu&quot; in Nepali. Its Sanskrit name in medieval times was likely &quot;shishumar&quot;, and during the Mughal era, it was known as &quot;pani suar&quot;.

== Distribution ==
It lives along the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Karnaphuli-Sangu river systems of Bangladesh and India, and the Sapta Koshi and Karnali Rivers in Nepal. The Ganges river dolphin favours deep pools, eddy countercurrents located downstream of the convergence of rivers and of sharp meanders, and upstream and downstream of midchannel islands.

== Behaviour ==

The Ganges river dolphins usually swim alone or in pairs, they are known to breach rarely and are shy around boats and therefore difficult to observe.

=== Vocalization ===
This species shows object-avoidance behavior in both the consistently heavily murky waters of its habitat and in clear water in captivity, suggesting it is capable of using echolocation effectively to navigate and forage for prey. Information is limited on how extensively vocalization is used between individuals. It is capable of performing whistles, but rarely does so, suggesting that the whistle is a spontaneous sound and not a form of communication. The Ganges river dolphin most typically makes echolocation sounds such as clicks, bursts, and twitters. Produced pulse trains are similar in wave form and frequency to the echolocation patterns of the Amazon river dolphin. Both species regularly produce frequencies lower than 15 kHz and the maximum frequency is thought to fall between 15 and 60 kHz.

Echolocation is also used for population counts by using acoustic surveying. This method is still being developed and is not heavily used due to cost and technical skill requirement. Given the dolphin&#x27;s blindness, it produces an ultrasonic sound that is echoed off other fish and water species, allowing it to identify prey.

=== Reproduction ===
The Ganges river dolphin does not have a specific mating season. When a calf is born, 8–12 months after conception, it stays with its mother for one year.

=== Diet ===
The Ganges river dolphin finds food through echolocation and feeds on crustaceans such as prawns and fish including carp, mahseer, and even sharks such as the Ganges shark (&quot;Glyphis gangeticus&quot;). It also takes birds and turtles.

== Threats ==
The Ganges river dolphin has been listed as an Endangered species on the IUCN Red List since 1996. It is threatened by habitat fragmentation due to reduced dry-season river flows, entanglement in fishing gear and by-catch mortality, targeted hunting, pollution of rivers in proximity to urban areas and intensive agricultural landscapes; it is disturbed by inland navigation and potentially threatened by seismic surveys, oil well blowouts, and the effects of climate change on hydrological dynamics.
Human activity has played a large role in the reduction of its native range and population size due to stressors such as noise pollution, ship traffic and fishery bycatch, construction of dams and hydroelectric power plants. It is also endangered due to pollution and overfishing for oil. Entanglement in fishing nets as bycatch can cause significant damage to local populations, and individuals are taken each year by hunters; their oil and meat are used as a liniment, as an aphrodisiac, and as bait for catfish. Poisoning of the water supply by industrial and agricultural chemicals may also have been a contributing factor towards population decline, as these chemicals are biomagnified in the bodies of the dolphins. An immediate danger in National Chambal Sanctuary is the decrease in river depth and appearance of sand bars dividing the river course into smaller segments.

== Conservation ==
In 2017, it was estimated that the global Gangetic river dolphin population comprised less than 3,500 individuals. The underlying surveys are temporally patchy and believed to contain uncertainty.

The Ministry of Environment and Forest declared the Gangetic dolphin the national aquatic animal of India. A stretch of the Ganges River between Sultanganj and Kahlgaon in Bihar has been declared a dolphin sanctuary and named Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary, the first such protected area.

The Uttar Pradesh government in India is propagating ancient Hindu texts in hopes of raising the community support to save the dolphins from disappearing. One of the lines being versed from Valimiki&#x27;s Ramayana, highlighted the force by which the Ganges emerged from Shiva&#x27;s locks and along with this force came many species such as animals, fish, and the Shishumaar—the dolphin.

On 31 December 2020, a dead adult dolphin was found at the Sharda canal in the Pratapgarh district in India. A video circulated on social media showing a dozen men beating the dolphin with sticks and an axe. On 7 January 2021, three people were arrested. Similarly, there is another news story in which a few fishermen caught one Gangetic dolphin and feasted upon it, leading to their arrest by Kaushambhi police in Uttar Pradesh.

The species is protected from international trade by its listing in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. This makes commercial international trade prohibited.

Bangladesh has established six sanctuaries in the Sundarbans.

On 20 May 2013, India&#x27;s Ministry of Environment and Forests declared dolphins &#x27;nonhuman persons&#x27; and as such has forbidden their captivity for entertainment purposes; keeping dolphins in captivity must satisfy certain legal prerequisites.

=== Project Dolphin ===

On the occasion of the 74th Independence Day, 15 August 2020, the Indian Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change announced &#x27;Project Dolphin&#x27; to boost conservation of both river and oceanic dolphins.

== In culture ==

The Ganges dolphin is associated with Ganga and is occasionally the depiction of her vahana, the makara.

<text>The University of Michigan Executive System, or UMES, a batch operating system developed at the University of Michigan in 1958, was widely used at many universities. Based on the General Motors Executive System for the IBM 701, UMES was revised to work on the mainframe computers in use at the University of Michigan during this time (IBM 704, 709, and 7090) and to work better for the small student jobs that were expected to be the primary work load at the university.

UMES was in use at the University of Michigan until 1967, when MTS was phased in to take advantage of the newer virtual memory time-sharing technology that became available on the IBM System/360 Model 67.

<doc id="484891" wikidata="Q638755" url="?curid=484891" title="Descriptive geometry">
<text>Descriptive geometry is the branch of geometry which allows the representation of three-dimensional objects in two dimensions by using a specific set of procedures. The resulting techniques are important for engineering, architecture, design and in art. The theoretical basis for descriptive geometry is provided by planar geometric projections. The earliest known publication on the technique was &quot;Underweysung der Messung mit dem Zirckel und Richtscheyt&quot; (&quot;Observation of the measurement with the compass and spirit level&quot;), published in Linien, Nuremberg: 1525, by Albrecht Dürer. Italian architect Guarino Guarini was also a pioneer of projective and descriptive geometry, as is clear from his &quot;Placita Philosophica&quot; (1665), &quot;Euclides Adauctus&quot; (1671) and &quot;Architettura Civile&quot; (1686—not published until 1737), anticipating the work of Gaspard Monge (1746–1818), who is usually credited with the invention of descriptive geometry. Gaspard Monge is usually considered the &quot;father of descriptive geometry&quot; due to his developments in geometric problem solving. His first discoveries were in 1765 while he was working as a draftsman for military fortifications, although his findings were published later on.

Monge&#x27;s protocols allow an imaginary object to be drawn in such a way that it may be modeled in three dimensions. All geometric aspects of the imaginary object are accounted for in true size/to-scale and shape, and can be imaged as seen from any position in space. All images are represented on a two-dimensional surface.

Descriptive geometry uses the image-creating technique of imaginary, parallel projectors emanating from an imaginary object and intersecting an imaginary plane of projection at right angles. The cumulative points of intersections create the desired image.

==Protocols==
*Project two images of an object into mutually perpendicular, arbitrary directions. Each image view accommodates three dimensions of space, two dimensions displayed as full-scale, mutually-perpendicular axes and one as an invisible (point view) axis receding into the image space (depth). Each of the two adjacent image views shares a full-scale view of one of the three dimensions of space.
* Either of these images may serve as the beginning point for a third projected view. The third view may begin a fourth projection, and on ad infinitum. These sequential projections each represent a circuitous, 90° turn in space in order to view the object from a different direction.
* Each new projection utilizes a dimension in full scale that appears as point-view dimension in the previous view. To achieve the full-scale view of this dimension and accommodate it within the new view requires one to ignore the previous view and proceed to the second previous view where this dimension appears in full-scale.
* Each new view may be created by projecting into any of an infinite number of directions, perpendicular to the previous direction of projection. (Envision the many directions of the spokes of a wagon wheel each perpendicular to the direction of the axle.) The result is one of stepping circuitously about an object in 90° turns and viewing the object from each step. Each new view is added as an additional view to an orthographic projection layout display and appears in an &quot;unfolding of the glass box model&quot;.

Aside from the Orthographic, six standard principal views (Front; Right Side; Left Side; Top; Bottom; Rear), descriptive geometry strives to yield four basic solution views: the true length of a line (i.e., full size, not foreshortened), the point view (end view) of a line, the true shape of a plane (i.e., full size to scale, or not foreshortened), and the edge view of a plane (i.e., view of a plane with the line of sight perpendicular to the line of sight associated with the line of sight for producing the true shape of a plane). These often serve to determine the direction of projection for the subsequent view. By the 90° circuitous stepping process, projecting in any direction from the point view of a line yields its true length view; projecting in a direction parallel to a true length line view yields its point view, projecting the point view of any line on a plane yields the plane&#x27;s edge view; projecting in a direction perpendicular to the edge view of a plane will yield the true shape (to scale) view. These various views may be called upon to help solve engineering problems posed by solid-geometry principles

==Heuristics==

There is heuristic value to studying descriptive geometry. It promotes visualization and spatial analytical abilities, as well as the intuitive ability to recognize the direction of viewing for best presenting a geometric problem for solution. Representative examples:

=== The best direction to view ===
* Two skew lines (pipes, perhaps) in general positions in order to determine the location of their shortest connector (common perpendicular)
* Two skew lines (pipes) in general positions such that their shortest connector is seen in full scale
* Two skew lines in general positions such the shortest connector parallel to a given plane is seen in full scale (say, to determine the position and the dimension of the shortest connector at a constant distance from a radiating surface)
* A plane surface such that a hole drilled perpendicular is seen in full scale, as if looking through the hole (say, to test for clearances with other drilled holes)
* A plane equidistant from two skew lines in general positions (say, to confirm safe radiation distance?)
* The shortest distance from a point to a plane (say, to locate the most economical position for bracing)
* The line of intersection between two surfaces, including curved surfaces (say, for the most economical sizing of sections?)
* The true size of the angle between two planes

A standard for presenting computer-modeling views analogous to orthographic, sequential projections has not yet been adopted. One candidate for such is presented in the illustrations below. The images in the illustrations were created using three-dimensional, engineering computer graphics.

Three-dimensional, computer modeling produces virtual space &quot;behind the tube&quot;, as it were, and may produce any view of a model from any direction within this virtual space. It does so without the need for adjacent orthographic views and therefore may seem to render the circuitous, stepping protocol of Descriptive Geometry obsolete. However, since descriptive geometry is the science of the legitimate or allowable imaging of three or &quot;more&quot; dimensional space, on a flat plane, it is an indispensable study, to enhance computer modeling possibilities.

=== Examples ===

==== Finding the shortest connector between two given skew lines PR and SU ====

Given the X, Y and Z coordinates of P, R, S and U, projections 1 and 2 are drawn to scale on the X-Y and X-Z planes, respectively.

To get a true view (length in the projection is equal to length in 3D space) of one of the lines: SU in this example, projection 3 is drawn with hinge line H2,3 parallel to S2U2. To get an end view of SU, projection 4 is drawn with hinge line H3,4 perpendicular to S3U3. The perpendicular distance &quot;d&quot; gives the shortest distance between PR and SU.

To get points Q and T on these lines giving this shortest distance, projection 5 is drawn with hinge line H4,5 parallel to P4R4, making both P5R5 and S5U5 true views (any projection of an end view is a true view). Projecting the intersection of these lines, Q5 and T5 back to projection 1 (magenta lines and labels) allows their coordinates to be read off the X, Y and Z axes.

==General solutions==

General solutions are a class of solutions within descriptive geometry that contain all possible solutions to a problem. The general solution is represented by a single, three-dimensional object, usually a cone, the directions of the elements of which are the desired direction of viewing (projection) for any of an infinite number of solution views.

For example: To find the general solution such that two, unequal length, skew lines in general positions (say, rockets in flight?) appear:

* Equal length
* Equal length and parallel
* Equal length and perpendicular (say, for ideal targeting of at least one)
* Equal to lengths of a specified ratio
* others.

In the examples, the general solution for each desired characteristic solution is a cone, each element of which produces one of an infinite number of solution views. When two or more characteristics of, say those listed above, are desired (and for which a solution exists) projecting in the direction of either of the two elements of intersections (one element, if cones are tangent) between the two cones produces the desired solution view. If the cones do not intersect a solution does not exist. The examples below are annotated to show the descriptive geometric principles used in the solutions. TL = True-Length; EV = Edge View.

Figs. 1-3 below demonstrate (1) Descriptive geometry, general solutions and (2) simultaneously, a potential standard for presenting such solutions in orthographic, multiview, layout formats.

The potential standard employs two adjacent, standard, orthographic views (here, Front and Top) with a standard &quot;folding line&quot; between. As there is no subsequent need to &#x27;circuitously step&#x27; 90° around the object, in standard, two-step sequences in order to arrive at a solution view (it is possible to go directly to the solution view), this shorter protocol is accounted for in the layout. Where the one step protocol replaces the two-step protocol, &quot;double folding&quot; lines are used. In other words, when one crosses the double lines he is not making a circuitous 90° turn but a non-orthodirectional turn directly to the solution view. As most engineering computer graphics packages automatically generates the six principal views of the glass box model, as well as an isometric view, these views are sometimes added out of heuristic curiosity.

<text>USS &quot;Harder&quot; (SS-568), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the harder, a fish of the mullet family found off South Africa.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Harder&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut, on 30 June 1950. She was launched on 3 December 1951, sponsored by Kay Logan Cole, the widow of Lieutenant S. M. Logan, executive officer of the submarine , lost during World War II. &quot;Harder&quot; was commissioned on 19 August 1952.

==Service history==
After shakedown out of Newport, Rhode Island, &quot;Harder&quot; made a 1000-mile (1600-km) submerged passage from New London, Connecticut, to Nassau, Bahamas, while snorkeling. She then engaged in tests out of New London to evaluate fast attack type submarines.

&quot;Harder&quot; began fleet operations out of New London in June 1953. Shortly thereafter &quot;Harder&quot; departed for the British Isles. During this voyage, she experienced mechanical difficulties with her then-experimental Fairbanks type 3 engines. In August 1953, her engines broke down completely off the east coast of Ireland. She was taken under tow by and endured the longest tow in submarine history, 2100 miles (3400 km) across the Atlantic to New London, Connecticut.

During the next several years &quot;Harder&quot; carried out a schedule of training and readiness operations with ships of the Atlantic Fleet and Allied NATO nations. Operating from the North Atlantic to the Caribbean Sea, she engaged in sonar evaluation tests, supported ASW tactical exercises, and participated in submerged simulated attack operations. In March 1959 she participated in SUBICEX, during which she cruised 280 miles (450 km) beneath the ice packs off Newfoundland, further than any conventionally powered submarine had previously gone.

After completing a three-month advanced submarine exercise in the Atlantic, &quot;Harder&quot; switched her home port to Charleston, South Carolina, where she arrived 17 November and joined Submarine Squadron 4. She continued operations in the Atlantic and Caribbean for more than a year, then departed Charleston 24 May 1961 for deployment off the western coast of Europe and in the Mediterranean Sea. After reaching Bremerhaven, Germany, on 9 June, she supported ASW operations with ships of the Federal German Navy. The following month she sailed via Holy Loch, Scotland, and Rota, Spain, to the Mediterranean Sea where she supported peace-keeping operations of the 6th Fleet. &quot;Harder&quot; returned to Charleston 28 August.

Training exercises and tests evaluating ASROC and other ASW systems kept &quot;Harder&quot; busy until she entered Charleston Naval Shipyard for overhaul in October 1962.Ready for action in April 1963, she operated along the Atlantic Coast and in the Caribbean Sea for the next 2½ years polishing her underwater warfare tactics and operating with destroyer-type ships as they worked on ASW exercises.

&quot;Harder&quot; again entered Charleston Naval Shipyard on 22 October for a thorough overhaul and modernization in which she received an 18-foot hull extension to accommodate the new PUFFS passive sonar system, a redesigned superstructure, new engines, and improved electrical and electronic equipment. Modernization completed early in 1967, &quot;Harder&quot; rejoined the fleet.

==&quot;Romeo Romei&quot; (S 516)==

&quot;Harder&quot; was decommissioned on 31 January 1974, struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 20 February 1974, and sold to Italy.

Commissioned on 18 August 1974 as &quot;Romeo Romei&quot;, ex-&quot;Harder&quot; served the Italian Navy until she was decommissioned and scrapped in 1988.

<text>Hamarkameratene (), often abbreviated to HamKam or Ham-Kam, is a Norwegian professional football club based in the town of Hamar. The club was founded in 1918, originally under the name Freidig.

HamKam were most recently promoted to the Eliteserien in 2021. A third-place finish in 1970 is the highest position that the team has held in the top division; the club has never progressed beyond the semifinals of the Norwegian Cup, last reaching the semifinals in 1989.

Briskeby Stadion has been the home ground of Hamarkameratene since 1936. The construction of a completely modernized stadium began in 2007 but has never been completed. Originally scheduled to be completed in 2009, the expanded Briskeby is expected to have a capacity of 10,200 spectators on completion, but currently has a capacity of approximately 8,100.

== History ==

Hamarkameratene were founded as Freidig on 10 August 1918 by a group of teenagers. The prerequisite for joining the team was being able to pay for the football. Freidig applied for entry into the regional series in 1926, but were only admitted after their second attempt, in 1927. At the time a club by the name of &quot;Freidig&quot; was already playing in the series, so the boys from Hamar were forced to rename their team. The natural choice was Briskebyen Fotballag (&quot;Briskebyen&quot; Football Team), &quot;Briskeby&quot; being the name of their neighbourhood. The club had no permanent playing location until 1936, instead renting fields from various other clubs. Eventually this situation grew intolerable and ground for a stadium of their own was bought in 1934. Briskeby gressbane was inaugurated two years later and has remained the club&#x27;s home ground ever since. The neighborhood was located in the municipality Vang until an expansion of Hamar&#x27;s city limits in 1946.

In 1946, Briskebyen Fotballag joined up with the multimodal sports club Hamar Arbeideridrettslag (Hamar Workers&#x27; Sports Club) to form Hamarkameratene (literally meaning &quot;Comrades of Hamar&quot;). Because of the general reconciliation between bourgeois and workers&#x27; sports clubs, it was the wish of the municipality that all the sports clubs in Hamar merge, but in the end only these two clubs, who both considered themselves as working-class clubs and were from the same area, were able to reach an agreement. The first manager was Roy Wright, a former Wolverhampton player. His experience from English football, however, did not benefit the club and he was considered a disappointment. The Czechoslovakian Willem Cerveny, on the other hand, proved to be an influential asset to club and the development of a football culture in the region.

The first half of the 1970s was the club&#x27;s most successful period to date. Having won promotion to the 1. divisjon for the first time in 1969 (the highest level in Norway at the time), the green and white placed third overall in their first season, as well as reaching the semifinals of the Norwegian Cup. HamKam remained a stable contender in the 1. divisjon until 1974, when they were relegated. The club would earn promotion to the highest division three more times before 1980.

The &#x27;80s continued in much the same fashion as the latter part of the &#x27;70s, with the club going back and forth between the two top levels in Norwegian football. In 1984, a new stand with a capacity of 2,346 was constructed at Briskeby. A considerable loan was taken up to fund the stand, of which the club would feel the effects for the decade to come, among other things because of the rise in interest rates after the 1987 stock market correction. A measure of success was still achieved, however, with the club reaching the semifinals of the cup in 1987 and 1989.

A successful season in 1991 saw Hamarkameratene once again win promotion to the highest division, under Swedish coach Peter Engelbrektsson. The club managed to avoid relegation in 1992 by virtue of a better goal difference, and entered into 1993 with renewed confidence. After a slow start, the team began climbing towards the top, and were in reach of second place and even the championship towards the end of the season, but with a slump in form a fifth place was the still-positive result.

HamKam spent another two years in the top flight before entering a recession. In 1994, the municipality bought the stadium to remove the debt which had nearly bankrupted the club. Coach Engelbrektsson left after relegation to the 1. divisjon in 1995, and the club failed to earn promotion in 1996 and 1997. Serious financial problems emerged at the beginning of 1998. This time a group of private investors prevented bankruptcy, but HamKam were unable to even retain their spot in the 1. divisjon and were relegated to the 2. divisjon. Promotion back into the 1. divisjon was won the following season, and a slow process followed to rebuild the team. In 2001 the club nearly made it back to the first tier but lost the playoff against Bryne. The following season was a disappointment, with only eighth place to show for, and the club was yet again experiencing financial problems.

After struggling for seven years, the hiring of Ståle Solbakken as the team&#x27;s coach before the start of the 2003 season marked the beginning of another short stay at the top of Norwegian football for the green and white. Having won the 1. divisjon in 2003, they entered the top division for the first time since 1995. The first season in the top flight in eight years was a formidable success. Under Solbakken&#x27;s leadership, HamKam were in contention for a spot among the final four and a place in the UEFA Cup qualifying rounds. They would eventually end the season in fifth place. Thought by many to be unable to cope in the company of wealthier clubs, this was an impressive feat by the team with the second-smallest budget of them all.

Expectations were high in 2005, but despite early prospects of a good season (in their first game, they defeated would-be champions Vålerenga), HamKam were unable to perform consistently and ended up in a disappointing tenth place. Soon after, Solbakken announced that he would be leaving the club to become manager of FC Copenhagen. He was succeeded by the former Norwegian national goalkeeper Frode Grodås.

Solbakken&#x27;s tenure at Hamarkameratene had left the club in a much improved state from prior to his arrival. Gone were the financial problems that had plagued the club for two decades. People were once again coming to see the team play, with attendances now averaging more than 5,500, a number not seen since the &#x27;70s. Fans of the club had even gone as far as to nickname their manager Ståle &quot;Salvatore&quot; (&quot;the saviour&quot;) in recognition of his achievements.

His successor failed to capitalize. HamKam picked up where they left off in 2005, scoring some spectacular wins against top teams while again being unable to perform consistently. As the season neared its end, however, Frode Grodås failed where Solbakken had succeeded, namely in keeping HamKam away from the relegation zone. Going into the final round of the season, they found themselves third from the bottom of the table and in need of a win. HamKam instead suffered a humiliating 1–5 loss at home, dropping to 13th place and relegation in 2006.

As a result, the board decided to fire Grodås from his position as head coach, and on 13 November Arne Erlandsen was hired as his replacement. Vegard Skogheim, a long-time favourite amongst the fans, was hired as assistant coach. HamKam returned to the top division in 2007 but relegated again to 1. divisjon as 14th or last in 2008. HamKam slipped down to 2. divisjon as 13th after losing 1–0 away match against Sparta Sarpsborg in 2009.

In the 2010 season, HamKam won its section of the Second Division and won promotion back to the second tier. However, economic problems came to a head, and on 21 December 2010, the board announced that the club had decided to file for bankruptcy on 30 December, unless fresh funds were raised by that time.

In the 2021 season, HamKam were promoted from the First Division as champions, returning to the Eliteserien for the first time since 2008.

==Stadium==

HamKam play their home games as Briskeby Stadion, an all-seater football stadium located at Briskebyen in Hamar. The venue is owned by Hamar Municipality. The new section of Briskeby has the same style and building materials as the two other main sports venues in Hamar, Vikingskipet and Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre, which were built for the 1994 Winter Olympics. The venue has capacity for 8,068 spectators and has club seating 600 people. The pitch is artificial turf. Around the pitch are 180 digital advertising board. There are two scoreboard screens. The stands have 13 concession stands, all which are built to allow a view of the pitch while standing in a queue.

<doc id="484921" wikidata="Q7761805" url="?curid=484921" title="The Rule of Names">
<text>&quot;The Rule of Names&quot; is a short story by American writer Ursula K. Le Guin, first published in the April 1964 issue of &quot;Fantastic&quot; and reprinted in collections such as &quot;The Wind&#x27;s Twelve Quarters&quot;. This story and &quot;The Word of Unbinding&quot; convey Le Guin&#x27;s initial concepts for the Earthsea realm, including its places and physical manifestation. Most of the characters from the novels do not make an appearance, with the exception of the dragon Yevaud. Both stories help explain the foundations of the Earthsea realm, in particular the importance of true names to magic.

==Plot summary==
Sattins Island (among the Islands of Earthsea, though this is not mentioned in the original story) contains a rustic village and a resident wizard, nicknamed &quot;Underhill&quot; because he lives in a cave below a hill. Fat, shy, and largely incompetent, Underhill mostly uses simple magic to help the villagers with day-to-day minor medical and agricultural difficulties. Meanwhile, the village&#x27;s teacher, the pretty Palani, introduces the concept of naming to her schoolchildren: each citizen of Earthsea has one name as a child, which they abandon at puberty in favor of their &quot;true name&quot;, but this name must be kept private as it can be used by ill-intentioned magicians to control the individual.

One day, a lone handsome stranger from the distant Archipelago arrives on the island. The locals dub him Blackbeard. He hires a village lad called Birt to guide him to Underhill&#x27;s home. Speaking to Birt, Blackbeard reveals his purpose: he is a powerful magician searching for his ancestors&#x27; treasure, which was stolen by a dragon. He believes Underhill to be a wizard who defeated the dragon and made off with the treasure.

Birt and Blackbeard arrive at Underhill&#x27;s home. There, Blackbeard confronts Underhill, culminating in a battle in which the two magicians shapeshift into different animals and natural forces. After Underhill transforms into a massive dragon, Blackbeard reveals that he knows Underhill&#x27;s true name, Yevaud, and that speaking the name will lock Underhill into his true form. This proves effective, but not as Blackbeard expected; Underhill explains that he is in fact the dragon who stole the treasure of Blackbeard&#x27;s ancestors, and so his true form is indeed that of a dragon. Blackbeard, stunned, is hastily dispatched by Yevaud. Meanwhile, Birt flees the island, taking his love Palani with him. As he does so, Yevaud, embracing his predatory dragon nature, prepares to devour the villagers of Sattins Island.

In &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;, Ged knows this tale as an ancient bit of lore and makes a desperate gamble based on it.

== Literary significance and criticism ==
Susan Wood points out that it was during the early 1960s, when Ursula K. Le Guin was selling stories such as &quot;The Word of Unbinding&quot; and &quot;The Rule of Names&quot;, that she &quot;was an accomplished writer, expressing valuable insights with grace and humour&quot;.

The story underscores the importance of language to the entire Earthsea Cycle. In particular, the use of &quot;names&quot; in the title, along with the use of &quot;word&quot; in &quot;The Word of Unbinding&quot;, solidifies this message in the first two Earthsea stories. Specifically, within the Earthsea realm, knowing another man&#x27;s or dragon&#x27;s true name gives one power over them; as a result, sharing one&#x27;s true name with another is an act of complete trust.

In later parts of the Earthsea Cycle, the concept of humans and dragons being akin and having been originally one species is developed, and some persons such as Tehanu have a dual human-dragon nature. However, there is no hint of that in this early story. Yevaud had turned himself into a human being for the purpose of hiding, as Ged turned into a bird in &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; and Festin into a fish in &quot;The Word of Unbinding&quot;, and there is no suggestion that being human was inherent to him in any way.

<text>&quot;The Word of Unbinding&quot; is a short story by American writer Ursula K. Le Guin, first published in the January 1964 issue of &quot;Fantastic&quot;, and reprinted in collections such as &quot;The Wind&#x27;s Twelve Quarters&quot;. In this story, the Earthsea realm, later made setting of the novel &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;, was first introduced. Along with the story &quot;The Rule of Names&quot;, this story conveys Le Guin&#x27;s initial concepts for the Earthsea realm, including its places and physical manifestation, but not the characters appearing in the novels.

==Plot summary==
At the beginning of the story, the protagonist, a wizard named Festin, finds himself imprisoned. Thinking back, he recalls his apprehension at the news that the evil wizard Voll had been marching from island to island, among the islands of Earthsea subduing all in his way, with no one able to understand or fight his magic. Festin determines that Voll must have just reached his island; thus his imprisonment.

At first Festin, a strong wizard in his own right, is confident of his power to escape and overcome Voll – but all his attempts are rebuffed more than defeated. Finally, Festin&#x27;s desperate longing for his beloved countryside makes him transform himself into a fish, swimming in one of the island&#x27;s cool streams. However, Voll has noticed what happened, and a troll, one of the evil one&#x27;s servants, finds and takes Festin out of the water. The wizard is trapped by his own spell and cannot change back.

By now, Festin has realized that the source of Voll&#x27;s power and invulnerability is that he is already dead, and controls his servants from the world of the dead. The only course left to Festin is The Word of Unbinding, the uttering of which is tantamount to suicide – but which enables Festin to get at his enemy and destroy him.

Festin has forever lost the joys of his beloved island, but his sacrifice has saved others from Voll.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Susan Wood writes that Le Guin&#x27;s early stories of the 1960s such as &quot;The Word of Unbinding&quot; and &quot;The Rule of Names&quot; show that she &quot;was an accomplished writer, expressing valuable insights with grace and humour.&quot;

&quot;The Word of Unbinding&quot; underscores the importance of language to the entire Earthsea mythos. In particular, the use of &quot;word&quot; in the title, along with the use of &quot;names&quot; in &quot;The Rule of Names&quot; solidifies this message in the first two Earthsea stories.

The story foreshadows &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot; in which Ged similarly goes into the world of the dead to fight a &quot;dead&quot; enemy threatening the world of the living, and defeats him at the cost of enormous sacrifice (though in that case, of his power rather than his life).

<text>The Gillikin Country is the northern division of L. Frank Baum&#x27;s fictional land of Oz. It is distinguished by the color purple worn by most of the local inhabitants as well as the color of their surroundings. The inhabitants of Gillikin Country are called Gillikins.

==Etymology==
Martin Gardner suggests the name Gillikin may be named after the purple blossoms of the gillyflower.

==Elements in Gillikin Country==
Like all of the countries of Oz, the Gillikin Country contains various unusual sights, creatures, and places. Among them are:

===&quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;===
Note: The Gillikin Country is the only province of Oz not mentioned by name or visited by the characters in this particular book. The following locations are merely referenced by various characters through the story.

* The Forest of the Winged Monkeys - A forest that is home to the Winged Monkeys that obey whoever wears the enchanted Golden Cap.
* The Palace of the Good Witch of the North - It is never actually mentioned, but assumed to exist because the Good Witch of the North rules this particular province.
* The Ruby Palace of Gayelette - This is where Gayelette resides.

===&quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;===
* Jellia Jamb reports to have been born a Gillikin.
* Mombi&#x27;s House - The home of the witch Mombi.
* A yellow brick road, similar to the one in the Munchkin Country, connects the Gillikin Country to the Emerald City.

===&quot;The Tin Woodman of Oz&quot;===

* Magic Isle - An islet containing powerful and dangerous magical energies which is located in the remote corner of Gillikin Country.
* The Forest of Gugu - A forest ruled by Gugu the Leopard King with his counselors Loo the Unicorn, Rango the Gray Ape, and Bru the Bear. It is the largest forest in the Land of Oz. The Forest of Gugu contains an assortment of animals ranging from animals that are found in Africa (consisting of Elephants, Hippos, Leopards, Monkeys, Rhinos, and Zebras) to animals that are found everywhere else (consisting of Bears, Bison, Donkeys, Foxes, Green Serpents, Kangaroos, Unicorns, and Wolves).

Purplefield was restored when Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion made it out of the maze.

==Appearances in modern works==
In Gregory Maguire&#x27;s revisionist Oz novels &quot;&quot; and &quot;Son of a Witch&quot;, the Gillikin Country is simply called &#x27;Gillikin&#x27;. It is portrayed as more prosperous and industrially developed than other regions of Oz, and is home of Shiz University. The Yellow Brick Road emerges from the Emerald City&#x27;s northern Shiz Gate and leads to the Gillikinese capital, Shiz. From there, most of the Gillikinese cities are interconnected by the Great Gillikin Railway, which runs across the country along with the Gillikin River. (It is implied that the railway was built on the former route of the Yellow Brick Road.) In the west are the Pertha Hills, a mountainous region home to dairy farms, ancient pagan temples dedicated to fairy queen Lurline, and the tallest mountain in Oz, Mount Rouncible. In the east, the Great Gillikin Forest is home to a tribe of northern bears and lions living on the shores of Lake Corge. The railway keeps running further east to The Glikkus, where emerald mines are worked by miner trolls.

Galinda (i.e. Glinda) hails from Gillikin, as do (according to some) the ruling Ozma family. The people of this province are referred to as &#x27;Gillikinese&#x27;, and are distinguishable by their prominent foreheads and slightly gapped front teeth. They often have heads of curling blond hair, and are believed to be temperamental by non-Gillikinese.

Much of both of Edward Einhorn&#x27;s modern Oz novels, &quot;Paradox in Oz&quot; and &quot;The Living House of Oz&quot;, are set in Gillikin Country. They feature the kingdom of Tonsoria, homes to Princesses Ayala and Talia, and in Absurd City, home of the Parrot-Ox.

<text>Lake St. Clair () is a freshwater lake that lies between the Canadian province of Ontario and the U.S. state of Michigan. It was named in 1679 by French Catholic explorers after Saint Clare of Assisi, on whose feast day they first saw the lake. 

It is part of the Great Lakes system (although not considered one of the five Great Lakes), and along with the St. Clair River and Detroit River, Lake St. Clair connects Lake Huron (to the north) with Lake Erie (to the south). It has a total surface area of about and an average depth of just ; to ensure an uninterrupted waterway, government agencies in both countries have maintained a shipping channel through the shallow lake for more than a century.

==Geography==
This lake is situated about northeast of the downtown areas of Detroit, Michigan, and Windsor, Ontario. Along with the St. Clair River and Detroit River, Lake St. Clair connects Lake Huron (to its north) with Lake Erie (to its south). The area is notable for the fact that the Canadian territory around the lake (Windsor metropolitan area) lies south of the adjacent United States territory.

Lake St. Clair measures about from north to south and about from east to west. Its total surface area is about . This is a rather shallow lake for its size, with an average depth of about , and a maximum natural depth of . However, it is deep in the navigation channel which is dredged for lake freighter passage by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The lake is fed by the St. Clair River, which flows to the south from Lake Huron and has an extensive river delta where it enters Lake St. Clair. This is the largest delta of the Great Lakes System. 

Other rivers which feed Lake St. Clair are the Thames and Sydenham rivers which originate in Southwestern Ontario, and the Clinton River, which originates in Michigan. The outflow from Lake St. Clair travels from its southwestern end into the Detroit River, and then into Lake Erie.

The tarry time (i.e., the time between entering and leaving) of the water in Lake St. Clair averages about seven days, but this can vary from as little as two to as many as thirty days, depending on the direction of the winds, the water circulation patterns, and the amount of water that is flowing out of Lake Huron. For water flowing through the navigation channel, the time period is only about two days.

Lake St. Clair is part of the Great Lakes system, but very rarely included as one; the smallest Great Lake, Lake Ontario, is 17 times larger by surface area, and more than 80 times by volume. It is occasionally referred to as &quot;the sixth Great Lake&quot;. Scattered proposals have called for it to be officially recognized as a Great Lake, which might enable it to attract greater public funding for scientific research and other projects.

==Naming==

First Nations/Native Americans used the lake as part of their extensive navigation of the Great Lakes. The Mississauga called it &#x27;, meaning &quot;(at) the whirlpool&quot;. The Wea derived their name from a Miami cognate: &#x27;. 

In the latter part of the 17th century, the Mississauga established a village near the lake. Early French mapmakers had identified the lake by a variety of French and Iroquoian-language names, including &#x27; [Seawater Lake]; &quot;Lac Ganatchio&quot; (&quot;kettle,&quot; for its shape), in French &#x27;. A variety of Native names were associated with sweetness, as the lake was freshwater as opposed to saltwater. These included &quot;Otsiketa&quot; (sugar or candy), &quot;Kandequio&quot; or &quot;Kandekio&quot; (possibly candy), &quot;Oiatinatchiketo&quot; (probably a form of Otsiketa), and &quot;Oiatinonchikebo&quot;. Similarly, the Iroquois nations called present-day Lake Huron a term meaning &quot;The Grand Lake of the Sweet Sea&quot; (fresh water as opposed to salt water.) 

The French expressed this association on their maps as &#x27; (sweet sea) and the Dutch identified it in Latin as &#x27;.

On August 12, 1679, the French explorer René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle arrived with an expedition. He named the body of water &quot;Lac Sainte-Claire,&quot; as the expedition sighted it on the feast day of Saint Clare of Assisi. The historian on the voyage, Louis Hennepin, recorded that the Iroquoian tribes referred to the lake as &quot;Otseketa&quot;.

As early as 1710, the English adopted the French name, identifying the lake on their maps as Saint Clare. By the Mitchell Map in 1755, the spelling appeared as the shorter &quot;St. Clair,&quot; the form that became most widely used. Some scholars credit the name as honoring the American Revolutionary War General Arthur St. Clair, later Governor of the Northwest Territory, but the name Lake St. Clair was in use with this current spelling long before St. Clair became a notable figure. Together the place name and general&#x27;s name likely influenced settlers&#x27; naming a proliferation of nearby political jurisdictions: the Michigan county and township of St. Clair, as well as the cities of St. Clair and St. Clair Shores.

Some local historians attributed the namesake to Patrick Sinclair, a British officer who purchased land on the St. Clair River at the outlet of the Pine River. There, in 1764, he built Fort Sinclair, which was in use for nearly twenty years before being abandoned.

Unlike most smaller lakes in the region—but like the Great Lakes—&quot;Lake&quot; comes at the front of its proper name, rather than the end; this is reflective of its French origins.

== Human history ==
The Crawford Knoll Site located on the eastern branch of the St. Clair River delta uncovered bone and projectile points dating back to 1500 to 1000 BCE which suggest seasonal usage by the local Indigenous population.

==Water quality==
Lake St Clair&#x27;s location, downstream from the largest freshwater delta in the Great Lakes, has a large effect on its turbidity (clarity). Current water quality is quite good despite past incidents and a history of chemical bio-accumulation. A number of cities source drinking water from or just downstream of the lake and quality is closely monitored.

In the early 1970s, the Canadian and American governments closed the commercial fishery over concerns of bio-accumulation of mercury. The industry responsible for this contamination was the Dow Chemical Chlor-Alkali Plant in Sarnia, Ontario. Since 1949, Dow Chemical had been operating mercury cell plants for the production of chlorine and other chemicals. Through its production process, it discharged mercury into the river and contaminated the fishery. The fishery has since not been re-opened, although studies have now confirmed mercury levels are well within the safe range.

Sport fishing remains popular in the lake. The governments on both sides of the lakes continue to monitor and publish guides for sport fish consumption.

<doc id="484933" wikidata="Q252619" url="?curid=484933" title="List of dukes and kings of Croatia">
<text>This is a complete list of dukes and kings of [[Croatia]] () under domestic ethnic and elected dynasties during the Duchy of Croatia (until 925), the Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102), the Kingdom of Croatia and Dalmatia (1102–1526 in union with Kingdom of Hungary, 1527–1868 under Habsburg dynasty ending with 1868–1918 Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia).

This article follows the monarch&#x27;s title number according to Hungarian succession for convenience. For example, the Hungarian monarch Béla IV is according to Croatian succession correctly titled Béla III. This is because Hungarians had a king named Béla prior to the incorporation of Croatia under the Hungarian Crown but the Croats did not.

==Early history==

The details of the arrival of the Croats in the Balkans are sparsely documented by more or less reliable historical sources. Around late 6th and early 7th century, they migrated from White Croatia (around present-day Galicia). According to a legend recorded in the 10th-century &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot;, the Croats came to their present region under the leadership of five brothers (called Kloukas, Lobelos, Kosentzis, Mouchlo, and Chrobatos) and of two sisters (called Touga and Bouga), and successfully fought and expelled the Pannonian Avars influence in the Roman province of Dalmatia. The Croats started gradually converting to Christianity under the rule of Porga in the 7th century.

===Early archons of Croats (7th century)===
== Dukes of Lower Pannonia (8th century–896) ==
The areas of modern-day Croatia located in the Pannonian plain had also been settled by Slavic tribes in the early Middle Ages, and history recorded some of their rulers.

== Dukes of Croatia (8th century–925) ==
The common chronology of the dukes and kings of Croatia was conceptualized by Franjo Rački and Ferdo Šišić, but although generally accepted, has several controversial claims about the 9th and 10th century line of Trpimirović dynasty. In their interpretation of the &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; (which is mentioning in chronological order prince Terpimer father of Krasimer, prince Krasimer father of Miroslav who was killed by ban Pribina) the rulers, including Trpimir known from other sources as ruling cca. 845–864, have actually ruled in the first part of the 10th century and invented Trpimir II whose not mentioned in historical sources.

* Šišić&#x27;s old chronology: Borna, Vladislav, Mislav, Trpimir I, his son Zdeslav, Domagoj, unnamed Domagoj&#x27;s son, Zdeslav, Branimir, Muncimir, Tomislav, Trpimir II, Krešimir I, Miroslav, Michael Krešimir II with Helen of Zadar, Stephen Držislav, Svetoslav Suronja, Gojslav, Krešimir III, Stephen I, Petar Krešimir IV, and lastly Demetrius Zvonimir with brief rule of Stephen II and Petar Snačić.

* Komatina&#x27;s revised chronology (1): Borna, Vladislav, Mislav, Trpimir, Zdeslav, Domagoj, unnamed Domagoj&#x27;s son, Zdeslav, Branimir, Muncimir, Krešimir I, Miroslav, Tomislav I, Michael Krešimir II with Helen of Zadar, Stephen Držislav, Svetoslav Suronja, Gojslav, Krešimir III, Stephen I, Petar Krešimir IV, and lastly Demetrius Zvonimir with brief rule of Stephen II and Petar Snačić.

* Đaković&#x27;s revised chronology (2): Borna, Vladislav, Mislav, Trpimir, Krešimir I, Miroslav, Domagoj, unnamed Domagoj&#x27;s son, Zdeslav, Branimir, Muncimir, Tomislav I, Michael Krešimir II with Helen of Zadar, Stephen Držislav, Svetoslav Suronja, Gojslav, Krešimir III, Stephen I, Petar Krešimir IV, and lastly Demetrius Zvonimir with brief rule of Stephen II and Petar Snačić.

Višeslav of Croatia, who left behind a baptismal font day, which mentioned him being a duke, used to be considered by Croatian historiography as a duke of the Croats, but the evidence for most of the claims regarding him is too scarce.

== Kings of Croatia (925–1102) ==

In his letter from 925, Pope John X refers to Tomislav I of Trpimirović dynasty as &quot;Rex Chroatorum&quot; (King of the Croats). All Croatian rulers after Tomislav I held the title of King of Croatia. This is confirmed by epigraphic inscription mentioning the earliest known Croatian queen (&quot;regina&quot;) Domaslava dated to first half of 10th century.

== Under the Hungarian Crown (1102–1527) ==

From 1102, the reigning King of Hungary was also the ruler of the Kingdom of Croatia in agreement with the Croatian nobles (see &quot;Pacta conventa&quot;). Croatia was governed on his behalf by a viceroy (&quot;ban&quot;) and a parliament (&quot;sabor&quot;). In 1409 Ladislaus of Naples sold his rights to Dalmatia to Republic of Venice for 100,000 ducats.

== Under the Habsburg monarchy (1527–1918) ==
On 1 January 1527, the Croatian Parliament met in Cetin to elect Ferdinand I of Habsburg as the new King of Croatia. The Habsburg monarchy had annexed the lands of Dalmatia after the Napoleonic War of the First Coalition. The Kingdom of Dalmatia was a crown land of the Austrian Empire (1815–1867) and the Cisleithanian half of Austria-Hungary (1867–1918).

== Kings of Yugoslavia (1918–1945) ==
After the World War I and the breakup of Austria-Hungary, Croatia joined a newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs as declared in the Zagreb Resolution (1918). Following a brief period of self-rule by National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (which was recognised by the Croatian Parliament, which beforehand proclamined national independence severing its ties to Austria-Hungary and Kingdom of Hungary and nullified the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement), after the controversial Geneva Declaration (1918) that state became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes under the Karađorđević dynasty (which was not completely accepted by the National Council nor ever confirmed by the Croatian Parliament). After the Vidovdan Constitution (1921), temporarily ceased to exist the Croatian Parliament. It was followed by 6 January Dictatorship (1929) and 1931 Yugoslav Constitution.

The name of the kingdom was changed in 1929, amid unitarianist reforms, to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. After the Treaty of Rapallo in 1920 Istria and parts of Dalmatia were annexed to Kingdom of Italy. On the basis of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement, and the Decree on the Banate of Croatia dated 24 August 1939, the Banate of Croatia was created. Under the Agreement was again elected Croatian Parliament (sabor) and a crown-appointed ban would decide internal matters in Croatia.

== King of the Independent State of Croatia (1941–1943) ==
In 1941, Croatia was occupied by the Axis powers along with the rest of Yugoslavia. The Independent State of Croatia was set as a puppet state of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Soon after its creation, the state government passed three laws on the creation of the Crown of Zvonimir, which made the country &quot;de jure&quot; a kingdom. Three days later the Treaties of Rome were signed. The Italian Prince Aimone of Savoy-Aosta was designated King of Croatia. Numerous Adriatic islands and a portion of Dalmatia were annexed by Italy, which all combined to become the Italian Governonate of Dalmatia. On September 10, 1943 Independent State of Croatia declared that the Treaties of Rome were null and void and annexed the portion of Dalmatia that had been ceded to Italy.

==&quot;Duke of Croatia&quot;==
The title Duke of Croatia has been used widely:
*The Doges of Venice used it, with Byzantine approval, from c. 1100, when Hungary was in the process of absorbing the Kingdom of Croatia, until the Treaty of Zadar with Hungary in 1358.
*The Dukes of Merania, whose territory bordered Croatia, were sometimes called Dukes of Croatia in contemporary chronicles.
*Various Hungarian noblemen granted authority in the South Slav lands added Croatia to their title of Duke of Slavonia in the 13th and 14th centuries.

<doc id="484938" wikidata="Q5501357" url="?curid=484938" title="Freight Elevator Quartet">
<text>The Freight Elevator Quartet (FEQ) were a music performance group specializing in improvised electronic music active in and around New York City. They performed and recorded continuously from 1996 to 2003, and collaborated extensively with experimental music artists such as DJ Spooky and Elliott Sharp, and avant-garde videographer Mark McNamara.

In addition to using electronic instruments (originally analog synthesizers and drum machines, later laptops and samplers), they also sported fairly unusual acoustic instrumentation, having a cellist and a didjeridoo player in their regular line-up. FEQ began as a house band for a series of warehouse parties on 125th Street in New York City, famously playing their first gig in a freight elevator. Their eponymous first record, released in 1997, was completely made of live recordings from shows played in their first year of performing, featuring the lineup of Stephen Krieger on drum machine, Rachael Finn on amplified cello, Paul Feuer on didjeridoo, and R. Luke DuBois on Buchla and Serge analog synthesizers. Their second and subsequent records saw the gradual expansion of their instrumentation (starting with Feuer doubling on keyboards and DuBois playing guitars) until by the time of their break-up in 2003 the entire band was effectively composed of multi-instrumentalists.

As a conceptual project the Freight Elevator Quartet combined influences from experimental music and conceptual art as well as a strong interest in musical Futurism (played out in their joint recording with DJ Spooky, &quot;File Under Futurism&quot;). In their liner notes, they referred to themselves as a group of musicians in the &quot;present imagining the past imaging the future,&quot; a concept akin to the literary conceit of Steampunk; by combining cutting-edge digital (computers, samplers), obsolescent solid state (analog synthesizers), classical 18th century (cello), and aboriginal (didjeridoo) instrumentation, the group deliberately confused the temporal reference point of their music. Stylistically FEQ was known to appropriate whatever genres they felt like, working to fuse different styles of breakbeat, drum and bass, downtempo, digital hardcore, rock, hip hop, classical, and, most conspicuously, academic computer music. Though always billing themselves as an electronica act, their music has many stylistic similarities to the later genre of post-rock. Most of their recordings are culled from composite takes of live performances, though they have released two studio albums as well, both of which feature songs with guest vocalists, including Lorraine Lelis of the band Mahogany and Spezialmaterial recording artist Josh Druckman (as JMD).

The Freight Elevator Quartet were for many years the unofficial ensemble-in-residence of the Computer Music Center, Columbia University. Following their breakup, DuBois remained active as a laptop musician and conceptual artist, working extensively with contemporary and avant-garde music performance composers and groups, such as LEMUR, Christian Marclay, Bang on a Can composer Michael Gordon, vocalist Lesley Flanigan, and violinist/composer Todd Reynolds.

<doc id="484939" wikidata="Q17147" url="?curid=484939" title="Egg">
<text>An egg is an organic vessel grown by an animal to carry a possibly fertilized egg cell (a zygote) and to incubate from it an embryo within the egg until the embryo has become an animal fetus that can survive on its own, at which point the animal hatches.

Most arthropods, vertebrates (excluding live-bearing mammals), and mollusks lay eggs, although some, such as scorpions, do not.

Reptile eggs, bird eggs, and monotreme eggs are laid out of water and are surrounded by a protective shell, either flexible or inflexible. Eggs laid on land or in nests are usually kept within a warm and favorable temperature range while the embryo grows. When the embryo is adequately developed it hatches, i.e., breaks out of the egg&#x27;s shell. Some embryos have a temporary egg tooth they use to crack, pip, or break the eggshell or covering.

The largest recorded egg is from a whale shark and was in size. Whale shark eggs typically hatch within the mother. At and up to , the ostrich egg is the largest egg of any living bird, though the extinct elephant bird and some non-avian dinosaurs laid larger eggs. The bee hummingbird produces the smallest known bird egg, which measures between long and weighs half of a gram (around 0.02 oz). Some eggs laid by reptiles and most fish, amphibians, insects, and other invertebrates can be even smaller.

Reproductive structures similar to the egg in other kingdoms are termed &quot;spores&quot;, or in spermatophytes &quot;seeds&quot;, or in gametophytes &quot;egg cells&quot;.

== Eggs of different animal groups ==
Several major groups of animals typically have readily distinguishable eggs.


=== Fish and amphibian eggs ===

The most common reproductive strategy for fish is known as oviparity, in which the female lays undeveloped eggs that are externally fertilized by a male. Typically large numbers of eggs are laid at one time (an adult female cod can produce 4–6 million eggs in one spawning) and the eggs are then left to develop without parental care. When the larvae hatch from the egg, they often carry the remains of the yolk in a yolk sac which continues to nourish the larvae for a few days as they learn how to swim. Once the yolk is consumed, there is a critical point after which they must learn how to hunt and feed or they will die.

A few fish, notably the rays and most sharks use ovoviviparity in which the eggs are fertilized and develop internally. However, the larvae still grow inside the egg consuming the egg&#x27;s yolk and without any direct nourishment from the mother. The mother then gives birth to relatively mature young. In certain instances, the physically most developed offspring will devour its smaller siblings for further nutrition while still within the mother&#x27;s body. This is known as intrauterine cannibalism.

In certain scenarios, some fish such as the hammerhead shark and reef shark are viviparous, with the egg being fertilized and developed internally, but with the mother also providing direct nourishment.

The eggs of fish and amphibians are jellylike. Cartilaginous fish (sharks, skates, rays, chimaeras) eggs are fertilized internally and exhibit a wide variety of both internal and external embryonic development. Most fish species spawn eggs that are fertilized externally, typically with the male inseminating the eggs after the female lays them. These eggs do not have a shell and would dry out in the air. Even air-breathing amphibians lay their eggs in water, or in protective foam as with the Coast foam-nest treefrog, &quot;Chiromantis xerampelina&quot;.

=== Bird eggs ===

Bird eggs are laid by females and incubated for a time that varies according to the species; a single young hatches from each egg. Average clutch sizes range from one (as in condors) to about 17 (the grey partridge). Some birds lay eggs even when not fertilized (e.g. hens); it is not uncommon for pet owners to find their lone bird nesting on a clutch of unfertilized eggs, which are sometimes called wind-eggs.

==== Colours ====

The default colour of vertebrate eggs is the white of the calcium carbonate from which the shells are made, but some birds, mainly passerines, produce coloured eggs. The colour comes from pigments deposited on top of the calcium carbonate base; biliverdin and its zinc chelate, and bilirubin, give a green or blue ground colour, while protoporphyrin IX produces reds and browns as a ground colour or as spotting.

Non-passerines typically have white eggs, except in some ground-nesting groups such as the Charadriiformes, sandgrouse and nightjars, where camouflage is necessary, and some parasitic cuckoos which have to match the passerine host&#x27;s egg. Most passerines, in contrast, lay coloured eggs, even if there is no need of cryptic colors. However, some have suggested that the protoporphyrin markings on passerine eggs actually act to reduce brittleness by acting as a solid-state lubricant. If there is insufficient calcium available in the local soil, the egg shell may be thin, especially in a circle around the broad end. Protoporphyrin speckling compensates for this, and increases inversely to the amount of calcium in the soil.

For the same reason, later eggs in a clutch are more spotted than early ones as the female&#x27;s store of calcium is depleted.

The color of individual eggs is also genetically influenced, and appears to be inherited through the mother only, suggesting that the gene responsible for pigmentation is on the sex-determining W chromosome (female birds are WZ, males ZZ).

It used to be thought that color was applied to the shell immediately before laying, but subsequent research shows that coloration is an integral part of the development of the shell, with the same protein responsible for depositing calcium carbonate, or protoporphyrins when there is a lack of that mineral.

In species such as the common guillemot, which nest in large groups, each female&#x27;s eggs have very different markings, making it easier for females to identify their own eggs on the crowded cliff ledges on which they breed.

Yolks of birds&#x27; eggs are yellow from carotenoids, it is affected by their living conditions and diet.

==== Shell ====
Bird eggshells are diverse. For example:
*cormorant eggs are rough and chalky
*tinamou eggs are shiny
*duck eggs are oily and waterproof
*cassowary eggs are heavily pitted

Tiny pores in bird eggshells allow the embryo to breathe. The domestic hen&#x27;s egg has around 7000 pores.

Some bird eggshells have a coating of vaterite spherules, which is a rare polymorph of calcium carbonate. In Greater Ani &quot;Crotophaga major&quot; this vaterite coating is thought to act as a shock absorber, protecting the calcite shell from fracture during incubation, such as colliding with other eggs in the nest.

==== Shape ====

Most bird eggs have an oval shape, with one end rounded and the other more pointed. This shape results from the egg being forced through the oviduct. Muscles contract the oviduct behind the egg, pushing it forward. The egg&#x27;s wall is still shapeable, and the pointed end develops at the back. One hypothesis is that long, pointy eggs are an incidental consequence of having a streamlined body typical of birds with strong flying abilities; flight narrows the oviduct, which changes the type of egg a bird can lay.

Cliff-nesting birds often have highly conical eggs. They are less likely to roll off, tending instead to roll around in a tight circle; this trait is likely to have arisen due to evolution via natural selection. In contrast, many hole-nesting birds have nearly spherical eggs.

==== Predation ====
Many animals feed on eggs. For example, principal predators of the black oystercatcher&#x27;s eggs include raccoons, skunks, mink, river and sea otters, gulls, crows and foxes. The stoat (&quot;Mustela erminea&quot;) and long-tailed weasel (&quot;M. frenata&quot;) steal ducks&#x27; eggs. Snakes of the genera &quot;Dasypeltis&quot; and &quot;Elachistodon&quot; specialize in eating eggs.

Brood parasitism occurs in birds when one species lays its eggs in the nest of another. In some cases, the host&#x27;s eggs are removed or eaten by the female, or expelled by her chick. Brood parasites include the cowbirds and many Old World cuckoos.

=== Amniote eggs and embryos ===

Like amphibians, amniotes are air-breathing vertebrates, but they have complex eggs or embryos, including an amniotic membrane. Amniotes include reptiles (including dinosaurs and their descendants, birds) and mammals.

Reptile eggs are often rubbery and are always initially white. They are able to survive in the air. Often the sex of the developing embryo is determined by the temperature of the surroundings, with cooler temperatures favouring males. Not all reptiles lay eggs; some are viviparous (&quot;live birth&quot;).

Dinosaurs laid eggs, some of which have been preserved as petrified fossils.

Among mammals, early extinct species laid eggs, as do platypuses and echidnas (spiny anteaters). Platypuses and two genera of echidna are Australian monotremes. Marsupial and placental mammals do not lay eggs, but their unborn young do have the complex tissues that identify amniotes.

=== Mammalian eggs ===
The eggs of the egg-laying mammals (the platypus and the echidnas) are macrolecithal eggs very much like those of reptiles. The eggs of marsupials are likewise macrolecithal, but rather small, and develop inside the body of the female, but do not form a placenta. The young are born at a very early stage, and can be classified as a &quot;larva&quot; in the biological sense.

In placental mammals, the egg itself is void of yolk, but develops an umbilical cord from structures that in reptiles would form the yolk sac. Receiving nutrients from the mother, the fetus completes the development while inside the uterus.

=== Invertebrate eggs ===

Eggs are common among invertebrates, including insects, spiders, mollusks, and crustaceans.

==Evolution and structure==
All sexually reproducing life, including both plants and animals, produces gametes. The male gamete cell, sperm, is usually motile whereas the female gamete cell, the ovum, is generally larger and . The male and female gametes combine to produce the zygote cell. In multicellular organisms, the zygote subsequently divides in an organised manner into smaller more specialised cells, so that this new individual develops into an embryo. In most animals, the embryo is the sessile initial stage of the individual life cycle, and is followed by the emergence (that is, the hatching) of a motile stage. The zygote or the ovum itself or the sessile organic vessel containing the developing embryo may be called the egg.

A recent proposal suggests that the phylotypic animal body plans originated in cell aggregates before the existence of an egg stage of development. Eggs, in this view, were later evolutionary innovations, selected for their role in ensuring genetic uniformity among the cells of incipient multicellular organisms.

==Formation==
The cycle of the egg&#x27;s formation is started by the gamete ovum being released (ovulated) and egg formation being started. The finished egg is then ovipositioned and eventual egg incubation can start.

==Scientific classifications==
Scientists often classify animal reproduction according to the degree of development that occurs before the new individuals are expelled from the adult body, and by the yolk which the egg provides to nourish the embryo.

===Egg size and yolk===
Vertebrate eggs can be classified by the relative amount of yolk. Simple eggs with little yolk are called &quot;microlecithal&quot;, medium-sized eggs with some yolk are called &quot;mesolecithal&quot;, and large eggs with a large concentrated yolk are called &quot;macrolecithal&quot;. This classification of eggs is based on the eggs of chordates, though the basic principle extends to the whole animal kingdom.

==== Microlecithal ====
Small eggs with little yolk are called microlecithal. The yolk is evenly distributed, so the cleavage of the egg cell cuts through and divides the egg into cells of fairly similar sizes. In sponges and cnidarians, the dividing eggs develop directly into a simple larva, rather like a morula with cilia. In cnidarians, this stage is called the planula, and either develops directly into the adult animals or forms new adult individuals through a process of budding.

Microlecithal eggs require minimal yolk mass. Such eggs are found in flatworms, roundworms, annelids, bivalves, echinoderms, the lancelet and in most marine arthropods. In anatomically simple animals, such as cnidarians and flatworms, the fetal development can be quite short, and even microlecithal eggs can undergo direct development. These small eggs can be produced in large numbers. In animals with high egg mortality, microlecithal eggs are the norm, as in bivalves and marine arthropods. However, the latter are more complex anatomically than e.g. flatworms, and the small microlecithal eggs do not allow full development. Instead, the eggs hatch into larvae, which may be markedly different from the adult animal.

In placental mammals, where the embryo is nourished by the mother throughout the whole fetal period, the egg is reduced in size to essentially a naked egg cell.

====Mesolecithal====

Mesolecithal eggs have comparatively more yolk than the microlecithal eggs. The yolk is concentrated in one part of the egg (the &quot;vegetal pole&quot;), with the cell nucleus and most of the cytoplasm in the other (the &quot;animal pole&quot;). The cell cleavage is uneven, and mainly concentrated in the cytoplasma-rich animal pole.

The larger yolk content of the mesolecithal eggs allows for a longer fetal development. Comparatively anatomically simple animals will be able to go through the full development and leave the egg in a form reminiscent of the adult animal. This is the situation found in hagfish and some snails. Animals with smaller size eggs or more advanced anatomy will still have a distinct larval stage, though the larva will be basically similar to the adult animal, as in lampreys, coelacanth and the salamanders.

====Macrolecithal====

Eggs with a large yolk are called macrolecithal. The eggs are usually few in number, and the embryos have enough food to go through full fetal development in most groups. Macrolecithal eggs are only found in selected representatives of two groups: Cephalopods and vertebrates.

Macrolecithal eggs go through a different type of development than other eggs. Due to the large size of the yolk, the cell division can not split up the yolk mass. The fetus instead develops as a plate-like structure on top of the yolk mass, and only envelopes it at a later stage. A portion of the yolk mass is still present as an external or semi-external yolk sac at hatching in many groups. This form of fetal development is common in bony fish, even though their eggs can be quite small. Despite their macrolecithal structure, the small size of the eggs does not allow for direct development, and the eggs hatch to a larval stage (&quot;fry&quot;). In terrestrial animals with macrolecithal eggs, the large volume to surface ratio necessitates structures to aid in transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide, and for storage of waste products so that the embryo does not suffocate or get poisoned from its own waste while inside the egg, see amniote.

In addition to bony fish and cephalopods, macrolecithal eggs are found in cartilaginous fish, reptiles, birds and monotreme mammals. The eggs of the coelacanths can reach a size of in diameter, and the young go through full development while in the uterus, living on the copious yolk.

===Egg-laying reproduction===
Animals are commonly classified by their manner of reproduction, at the most general level distinguishing egg-laying (Latin. &quot;oviparous&quot;) from live-bearing (Latin. &quot;viviparous&quot;).

These classifications are divided into more detail according to the development that occurs before the offspring are expelled from the adult&#x27;s body. Traditionally:
*Ovuliparity means the female spawns unfertilized eggs (ova), which must then be externally fertilised. Ovuliparity is typical of bony fish, anurans, echinoderms, bivalves and cnidarians. Most aquatic organisms are ovuliparous. The term is derived from the diminutive meaning &quot;little egg&quot;.
*Oviparity is where fertilisation occurs internally and so the eggs laid by the female are zygotes (or newly developing embryos), often with important outer tissues added (for example, in a chicken egg, no part outside of the yolk originates with the zygote). Oviparity is typical of birds, reptiles, some cartilaginous fish and most arthropods. Terrestrial organisms are typically oviparous, with egg-casings that resist evaporation of moisture. 
*Ovo-viviparity is where the zygote is retained in the adult&#x27;s body but there are no &quot;trophic&quot; (feeding) interactions. That is, the embryo still obtains all of its nutrients from inside the egg. Most live-bearing fish, amphibians or reptiles are actually ovoviviparous. Examples include the reptile &quot;Anguis fragilis&quot;, the sea horse (where zygotes are retained in the male&#x27;s ventral &quot;marsupium&quot;), and the frogs &quot;Rhinoderma darwinii&quot; (where the eggs develop in the vocal sac) and &quot;Rheobatrachus&quot; (where the eggs develop in the stomach).
*Histotrophic viviparity means embryos develop in the female&#x27;s oviducts but obtain nutrients by consuming other ova, zygotes or sibling embryos (oophagy or adelphophagy). This intra-uterine cannibalism occurs in some sharks and in the black salamander &quot;Salamandra atra&quot;. Marsupials excrete a &quot;uterine milk&quot; supplementing the nourishment from the yolk sac.
*Hemotrophic viviparity is where nutrients are provided from the female&#x27;s blood through a designated organ. This most commonly occurs through a placenta, found in most mammals. Similar structures are found in some sharks and in the lizard &quot;Pseudomoia pagenstecheri&quot;. In some hylid frogs, the embryo is fed by the mother through specialized gills.

The term hemotrophic derives from the Latin for blood-feeding, contrasted with histotrophic for tissue-feeding.

==Human use==

===Food===

Eggs laid by many different species, including birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, have probably been eaten by people for millennia. Popular choices for egg consumption are chicken, duck, roe, and caviar, but by a wide margin the egg most often humanly consumed is the chicken egg, typically unfertilized.

====Eggs and Kashrut====

According to the Kashrut, that is the set of Jewish dietary laws, kosher food may be consumed according to &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law). Eggs are considered &quot;pareve&quot; (neither meat nor dairy) despite being an animal product and can be mixed with either milk or kosher meat.

===Vaccine manufacture===
Many vaccines for infectious diseases are produced in fertile chicken eggs. The basis of this technology was the discovery in 1931 by Alice Miles Woodruff and Ernest William Goodpasture at Vanderbilt University that the rickettsia and viruses that cause a variety of diseases will grow in chicken embryos. This enabled the development of vaccines against influenza, chicken pox, smallpox, yellow fever, typhus, Rocky mountain spotted fever and other diseases.

===Culture===

Eggs are an important symbol in folklore and mythology, often representing life and rebirth, healing and protection, and sometimes featuring in creation myths. Egg decoration is a common practice in many cultures worldwide. Christians view Easter eggs as symbolic of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. A popular Easter tradition in some parts of the world is the decoration of hard-boiled eggs (usually by dyeing, but often by hand-painting or spray-painting). Adults often hide the eggs for children to find, an activity known as an Easter egg hunt. A similar tradition of egg painting exists in areas of the world influenced by the culture of Persia. Before the spring equinox in the Persian New Year tradition (called Norouz), each family member decorates a hard-boiled egg and sets them together in a bowl. The tradition of a dancing egg is held during the feast of Corpus Christi in Catalan cities since the 16th century. It consists of an emptied egg, positioned over the water jet from a fountain, which starts turning without falling.

Although a food item, raw eggs are sometimes thrown at houses, cars, or people. This act, known commonly as &quot;egging&quot; in the various English-speaking countries, is a minor form of vandalism and, therefore, usually a criminal offense and is capable of damaging property (egg whites can degrade certain types of vehicle paint) as well as potentially causing serious eye injury. On Halloween, for example, trick or treaters have been known to throw eggs (and sometimes flour) at property or people from whom they received nothing. Eggs are also often thrown in protests, as they are inexpensive and nonlethal, yet very messy when broken.

==Collecting==

Egg collecting was a popular hobby in some cultures, including European Australians. Traditionally, the embryo would be removed before a collector stored the egg shell.

Collecting eggs of wild birds is now banned by many jurisdictions, as the practice can threaten rare species. In the United Kingdom, the practice is prohibited by the Protection of Birds Act 1954 and Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. However, illegal collection and trading persists.

Since the protection of wild bird eggs was regulated, early collections have come to the museums as curiosities. For example, the Australian Museum hosts a collection of about 20,000 registered clutches of eggs, and the collection in Western Australia Museum has been archived in a gallery. Scientists regard egg collections as a good natural-history data, as the details recorded in the collectors&#x27; notes have helped them to understand birds&#x27; nesting behaviors.

<text>Leonhart Fuchs (; 17 January 1501 – 10 May 1566), sometimes spelled Leonhard Fuchs and cited in Latin as &quot;Leonhartus Fuchsius&quot;, was a German physician and botanist. His chief notability is as the author of a large book about plants and their uses as medicines, a herbal, which was first published in 1542 in Latin. It has about 500 accurate and detailed drawings of plants, which were printed from woodcuts. The drawings are the book&#x27;s most notable advance on its predecessors. Although drawings had been used in other herbal books, Fuchs&#x27; book proved and emphasized high-quality drawings as the most telling way to specify what a plant name stands for.

== Life ==

Fuchs was born in 1501 in Wemding (Marktplatz 5), near Donauwörth in Donau-Ries in the then Duchy of Bavaria, as the youngest son of Johann (Hans) Fuchs and his wife Anna Denten. His father was the town Burgomaster, and both parents came from families of municipal councillors (&quot;Ratsherr&quot;). The exact date of his birth is unknown, but this was at the height of the German Renaissance. His father died prematurely in 1506, leaving Leonhart to be brought up by his mother and grandfather, an earlier Burgomaster. 

His family considered him gifted, but felt that local schools could not provide him with the education he needed. In 1511, with help from relatives, he was sent to the &quot;Lateinschule&quot; (grammar school) in Heilbronn (150 km west of Wemding), where Konrad Költer, the &quot;Rektor&quot; (1492–1527), also recognised his abilities. At that time, the school, had an excellent reputation, and Költer in particular for his teaching of Terence and Horace. The following year, Fuchs transferred to the &quot;Marienschule&quot; in Erfurt, Thuringia (320 km to the north), which provided intensive teaching in the classical languages, as a prerequisite to entrance in the University of Erfurt, which he then progressed to after six months. He was now eleven years old. At the time, the university at Erfurt was considered one of the premier German institutions of higher learning. At Erfurt, he matriculated in the Faculty of Arts, and by the 1516–7 winter semester had obtained his Baccalaureus artium, enabling him to teach, and he returned to Wemding to open a private school, at the age of 17. It was at Erfurt that he began his friendship with his contemporary, Joachim Camerarius.

On 28 June 1519 he started classes at the &quot;Hochschule&quot; (University of Ingolstadt), 62 km east of Wemding. There he studied Latin, Greek and Hebrew under, Johann Reuchlin and Jacob Ceporinus together with some philosophy and botany, and obtained his Magister Artium on 17 January 1521. During this time he became acquainted with the writings of Martin Luther, another graduate of Erfurt, and adopted the Lutheran faith. He then began to study medicine, obtaining his Medicinae Doctor on 1 March 1524.
From 1524 to 1526, he practiced as a doctor in Munich, until he was offered the chair of medicine at the University of Ingolstadt in 1526. The university was firmly Roman Catholic and carefully monitored the religious practices and opinions of its professors, creating problems for Fuchs&#x27; Lutheran views. Thus, in 1528 he accepted a position as personal physician to Georg, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach in Ansbach (then Onoltzbach or Onsbach), a Protestant. The position, which he held to 1531, came with a promise of a professorship at a university the Margrave was planning to found there. 

Fuchs was called to Tübingen by Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg in 1533 to help in reforming the University of Tübingen in the spirit of humanism. He created its first medicinal garden in 1535 and served as chancellor seven times, spending the last thirty-one years of his life as professor of medicine. Fuchs died in Tübingen in 1566.

While practicing in Munich he met and married Anna Catherina Friedberger, the daughter of a city councillor, (b. 1500 – d. 24 February 1563) in 1524. With her he had 4 sons and 6 daughters, two of whom died in infancy.

== Work ==
While working at Ansbach, Fuchs began his long career of scientific publications, beginning with his &quot;Errata recentiorum medicorum&quot; (Errors of modern doctors) in 1530, which he dedicated to his new patron. In this list of 60 &quot;errors&quot;, Fuchs took a stand on the controversy between &quot;Arabist&quot; and Greek medical traditions, siding solidly with the latter, and pointing out the contradictions. In places, he went too far in rejecting or ignoring some aspects of Arab medicine that were uncontested. He also criticized the confusion in nomenclature which led to the production of medicines that did not demonstrate the alleged effects. The book was well received by some, with Brunfels reproducing it in the second volume of his own herbal (&quot;Novi herbarii&quot;) in 1531. In others it invoked fury. Fuchs rebutted &quot;Arabist&quot; criticisms of the work in his &quot;Paradoxorum medicinae&quot; (1535), an expanded version of the &quot;Errata&quot;. 

Of his works on botanical illustration, the &quot;Codex Fuchs&quot; (&quot;Codex Vindobonensis Palatinus&quot;) is considered the most significant example of the Renaissance, with nine volumes, consisting of 1529 coloured plates. Those that are signed, are by Ziegler or Meyer.

=== Scientific views ===
Like his medieval predecessors and his contemporaries, Fuchs was heavily influenced by the three Greek and Roman writers on medicine and &quot;materia medica&quot;, Dioscorides, Hippocrates, and Galen. He wanted to fight the Arab hegemony in medicine, as it had been transmitted by the Medical School of Salerno, and to &quot;return&quot; to the Greek authors. Fuchs argued in favour of a return to using herbes medicinales (&quot;simples&quot;), in contrast to the arcane and often noxious &quot;compounds&quot; of medieval prescribing. But he also saw the importance of practical experience as well and offered botanical field days for the students, where he demonstrated the medicinal plants &quot;in situ&quot;. He founded one of the first German botanical gardens. 
Fuchs, together with Brunfels and Bock, published herbals, and their joint efforts marked a mid-sixteenth century German botanical renaissance, each acknowledging the contributions of the others. Their connection to medicine ensured a wide and enduring audience, both professional and vernacular. The authority of these authors was based on the principles of medical humanism.

=== Selected publications ===

Leonhart Fuchs wrote more than 50 books and polemics. Fuchs&#x27;s books on the anatomy of the eye and its diseases were among the standard references on this subject during this period.
* &quot;Compendiaria in artem medendi introductio […].&quot; Hagenau 1531
* &quot;Hippocratis medicorum omnium longe principis Epidemiorum liber sextus&quot; 1532
* &quot;Paradoxorum medicinae III&quot; (1535)
* &quot;Alle Kranckheyt der Augen&quot; (All diseases of the eye) (1539)
* &quot;De Historia Stirpium commentarii insignes&quot;, Isingrin, Basel 1542
* &quot;Codex Fuchs&quot;, Tübingen 1536–1566
Together with Joachim Camerarius and Hieronymus Gemusaeus, he published a complete edited edition of the works of Galen, which was printed by Andreas Cratander in 1538. 
==== &quot;De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes&quot; ====

De historia is Fuchs&#x27; major work, a large book about plants and their uses as medicines (a herbal) first appearing in Latin in 1542, and being rapidly translated into other languages. Although the text is largely borrowed from earlier authors, and is not based on any system of classification, with its 512 plates it set a new standard in botanical illustration. The accurate and detailed drawings, printed from woodcuts were the most notable advance on its predecessors. Although drawings had been used in other herbal books, Fuchs&#x27; book proved and emphasized high-quality drawings as the most telling way to specify what a plant name stands for. However, it was too erudite and too expensive to replace existing herbals.

== Legacy ==
Fuchs&#x27; name is commemorated in many ways in his home town of Wemding which has adopted the nickname of &quot;Fuchsienstadt&quot; (Fuchsia City), used the colour Fuchsia as its theme and decorated public places with plantings of &quot;Fuchsia&quot;. The house where he was born (&quot;Geburtshaus Leonhart Fuchs&quot;) bears a plaque. Because it is so small, it is known as the &quot;Zwergenhäuschen&quot; (dwarf house). The plaque reads: 
&quot;1501 – 1566. Hier ist geboren Leonhart Fuchs, berühmter Arzt und Botaniker. Nach ihm wurde die Fuchsie benannt&quot;&lt;br&gt;(1501 – 1566. Leonhart Fuchs, a famous doctor and botanist, was born here. The fuchsia was named after him)
For the 500th anniversary of his birth, a glass and steel pavilion for the fuchsia collection, the &quot;Fuchsienpavillon&quot; (Fuchsia house), was opened in 2001 in the Botanischer Garten der Universität Tübingen.

There is a cultivar of &quot;Fuchsia&quot; named &#x27;Wemding&#x27; (1993), there is a &quot;Fuchsienrundgang&quot; (fuchsia tour) each year in Wemding, together with the creation of a fuchsia pyramid. There is a &quot;Fuchsien- und Kräutermarkt&quot; (fuchsia and herb market), some local businesses are named after Fuchs, and there is a Leonhart-Fuchs School.

Fuchs, together with his two older German colleagues, Otto Brunfels (1488–1534) and Hieronymus Bock (1498–1554), has been described as a father of botany (or a German father of botany) establishing it as a scientific discipline independent from medicine in the sixteenth century, and a principal representative of New Galenism. His portrait forms the frontispiece of Agnes Arber&#x27;s book on herbals. After his death, the manuscript and plates of his &quot;Historia&quot; as placed in the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, Vienna, where it has remained. 

=== Eponymy (proper name) ===
Fuchs&#x27; name is preserved by the plant &quot;Fuchsia&quot;, discovered in the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean in 1696/97 by the French scientist and Minim friar Charles Plumier. He published the first description of &quot;Fuchsia triphylla, flore coccineo&quot; in 1703. The dye fuchsine (fuchsin, rosaniline hydrochloride or magenta) is named after the flower, and thus, the color fuchsia is indirectly named after Fuchs. The dye, developed in 1859, was given the name of fuchsine in France by its original manufacturer Renard frères et Franc because its color was similar to color of flowers of certain &quot;Fuchsia&quot; species, as well as the fact that &quot;Renard&quot; in French and &quot;Fuchs&quot; in German both mean fox. 

Fuchs is also recognised in the specific epithet of the a plant widespread over Europe and northern Asia: the common spotted orchid, &quot;Dactylorhiza fuchsii&quot;.

<text>The gelada (Theropithecus gelada, , ), sometimes called the bleeding-heart monkey or the gelada baboon, is a species of Old World monkey found only in the Ethiopian Highlands, living at elevations of above sea level. It is the only living member of the genus &quot;Theropithecus&quot;, a name derived from the Greek root words for &quot;beast-ape&quot; (θηρο-πίθηκος : thēro-píthēkos). Like its close relatives in genus &quot;Papio&quot;, the baboons, it is largely terrestrial, spending much of its time foraging in grasslands, with grasses comprising up to 90% of its diet.

It has buff to dark brown hair with a dark face and pale eyelids. Adult males have longer hair on their backs and a conspicuous bright red patch of skin shaped like an hourglass on their chests. Females also have a bare patch of skin but it is less pronounced, except during estrus, when it brightens and exhibits a &quot;necklace&quot; of fluid-filled blisters. Males average and females average in weight. The head-body length is with a tail of .

The gelada has a complex multilevel social structure. Reproductive units and male units are the two basic groupings. A band comprises a mix of multiple reproductive units and male units; a community is made up of one to four bands. Within the reproductive units the females are commonly closely related. Males will move from their natal group to try to control a unit of their own and females within the unit can choose to support or oppose the new male. When more than one male is in the unit, only one can mate with the females. The gelada has a diverse repertoire of vocalizations thought to be near in complexity to that of humans.

The population of geladas is thought to have dropped from 440,000 in the 1970s to 200,000 in 2008. Despite the heavy loss, it is listed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

==Taxonomy and evolution==

Since 1979, the gelada is customarily placed in its own genus (&quot;Theropithecus&quot;), though some genetic research suggests that this monkey should be grouped with its baboon (genus &quot;Papio&quot;) kin; other researchers have classified the species even more distantly from &quot;Papio&quot;. While &quot;Theropithecus gelada&quot; is the only living species of its genus, separate, larger species are known from the fossil record: &quot;T. brumpti&quot;, &quot;T. darti&quot; and &quot;T. oswaldi&quot;, formerly classified under genus &quot;Simopithecus&quot;. &quot;Theropithecus&quot;, while restricted at present to Ethiopia, is also known from fossil specimens found in Africa and the Mediterranean into Asia, including South Africa, Malawi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Algeria, Morocco, Spain, and India (more exactly at Mirzapur, Cueva Victoria, Pirro Nord, Ternifine, Hadar, Turkana, Makapansgat, and Swartkrans).

The two subspecies of gelada are:
* Northern gelada, &quot;T. g. gelada&quot;
* Eastern gelada, southern gelada, or Heuglin&#x27;s gelada, &quot;T. g. obscurus&quot;

===Common name===

The gelada has been referred to by other names, including the &quot;gelada baboon&quot;, &quot;bleeding-heart baboon&quot;, or simply &quot;baboon&quot;, implying a monophyletic relationship with baboons, which historically included (apart from &quot;Theropithecus&quot;) the genera &quot;Papio&quot; (true baboons), and &quot;Mandrillus&quot; (mandrills and drills). Since the 1990s, however, molecular phylogenetic studies clarified relationships among papionin monkeys, demonstrating that mangabeys of the genus &quot;Lophocebus&quot; are more closely related to &quot;Papio&quot; and &quot;Theropithecus&quot;, while mangabeys of the genus &quot;Cercocebus&quot; are more closely related to &quot;Mandrillus&quot;. These findings largely invalidated any scientifically based justification for referring to mandrills and drills as baboons, as doing so while excluding the unbaboon-like &quot;Lophocebus&quot; mangabeys would create a polyphyletic group. The status of geladas was less clear and the relationships among &quot;Papio&quot;, &quot;Lophocebus&quot;, and &quot;Theropithecus&quot; continue to reflect high levels of uncertainty, which are further complicated by the discovery of the kipunji. Nevertheless, the most recent and extensive phylogenetic study to date demonstrates that, while large fractions of the genome show an alternative history, the dominant relationship across the genome supports a closer relationship between &quot;Papio&quot; and &quot;Lophocebus&quot;, with &quot;Theropithecus&quot; as the outgroup. As a close sister relationship between &quot;Papio&quot; and &quot;Theropithecus&quot; is the least-supported scenario in recent studies, i &quot;gelada baboon&quot; and other names implying a close relationship with baboons, with increasing clarity, are not scientifically justified, leading researchers to advocate for the common name to be simply &quot;gelada&quot;.

==Description==

The gelada is large and robust, and it is covered with buff to dark-brown, coarse hair and has a dark face with pale eyelids. Its arms and feet are nearly black. Its short tail ends in a tuft of hair. Adult males have a long, heavy cape of hair on their backs. The gelada has a hairless face with a short muzzle that looks more similar to a chimpanzee&#x27;s than a baboon&#x27;s. It can also be physically distinguished from a baboon by the bright patch of skin on its chest. This patch is hourglass-shaped. On males, it is bright red and surrounded by white hair; on females, it is far less pronounced, but when in estrus, the female&#x27;s patch brightens, and a &quot;necklace&quot; of fluid-filled blisters forms on the patch. This is thought to be analogous to the swollen buttocks common to most baboons experiencing estrus. In addition, females have knobs of skin around their patches. Geladas also have well-developed ischial callosities. Sexual dimorphism is seen in this species; males average 18.5 kg (40.8 lb), while females are smaller, averaging 11 kg (24.3 lb). The head and body length of this species is 50–75 cm (19.7–29.5 in) for both sexes. Tail length is 30–50 cm (11.8–19.7 in).

The gelada has several adaptations for its terrestrial and graminivorous (grass-eating) lifestyle. It has small, sturdy fingers adapted for pulling grass and narrow, small incisors adapted for chewing it. The gelada has a unique gait, known as the shuffle gait, that it uses when feeding. It squats bipedally and moves by sliding its feet without changing its posture. Because of this gait, the gelada&#x27;s rump is hidden beneath, so is unavailable for display; its bright red chest patch is visible, though.
==Range and ecology==
Geladas are found only in the high grasslands of the deep gorges of the central Ethiopian plateau. They live in elevations above sea level, using the cliffs for sleeping and montane grasslands for foraging. These grasslands have widely spaced trees and also contain bushes and dense thickets. The highland areas where they live tend to be cooler and less arid than lowland areas. Thus, the geladas usually do not experience the negative effects that the dry season has on food availability. Nevertheless, in some areas, they do experience frost in the dry season, as well as hailstorms in the wet season.

Geladas are the only primates that are primarily graminivores and grazers – grass blades make up to 90% of their diet. They eat both the blades and the seeds of grasses. When both blades and seeds are available, geladas prefer the seeds. They eat flowers, rhizomes, and roots when available, using their hands to dig for the latter two. They consume herbs, small plants, fruits, creepers, bushes, and thistles. Insects can be eaten, but only rarely and only if they can easily be obtained. During the dry season, herbs are preferred over grasses. Geladas consume their food more like ungulates than primates, and they can chew their food as effectively as zebra.

Geladas are primarily diurnal. At night, they sleep on the ledges of cliffs. At sunrise, they leave the cliffs and travel to the tops of the plateaus to feed and socialize. When morning ends, social activities tend to wane and the geladas primarily focus on foraging. They travel during this time, as well. When evening arrives, they exhibit more social activities before descending to the cliffs to sleep. Predators observed to hunt geladas include domestic dogs, leopards, servals, hyenas, and lammergeiers.

==Behavior==

===Social structure===

Geladas live in a complex, multilevel society similar to that of the hamadryas baboon. The smallest and most basic groups are the reproductive units, which include up to 12 females, their young, and one to four males, and the all-male units, which are made up of 2–15 males. The next level of gelada societies are the bands, which are made up of two to 27 reproductive units and several all-male units. Herds consist of up to 60 reproductive units that are sometimes from different bands and last for short times. Communities are made of one to four bands whose home ranges overlap extensively. A gelada typically lives around 15 years.

Within the reproductive units, the females tend to be closely related and have strong social bonds. Reproductive units split if they become too large. While females have strong social bonds in the group, a female only interacts with at most three other members of her unit. Grooming and other social interactions among females usually occur between pairs. Females in a reproductive unit exist in a hierarchy, with higher-ranking females having more reproductive success and more offspring than lower-ranking females. Closely related females tend to have a similar hierarchical status. Females generally stay in their natal units for life; cases of females leaving are rare. Aggression within a reproduction unit, which is rare, is usually just between the females. Aggression is more frequent between members of different reproductive units and is usually started by females, but males and females from both sides can join and engage if the conflict escalates.
Males can remain in a reproductive unit for four to five years. While geladas have traditionally been considered to have a male-transfer society, many males appear to be likely to return and breed in their natal bands. Nevertheless, gelada males leave their natal units and try to take over a unit of their own. A male can take over a reproductive unit either through direct aggression and fighting or by joining one as a subordinate and taking some females with him to create a new unit. When more than one male is in a unit, only one of them can mate with the females. The females in the group together can have power over the dominant male. When a new male tries to take over a unit and overthrow the resident male, the females can choose to support or oppose him. The male maintains his relationship with the females by grooming them rather than forcing his dominance, in contrast to the society of the hamadryas baboon. Females accept a male into the unit by presenting themselves to him. Not all the females may interact with the male. Usually, one may be his main partner. The male may sometimes be monopolized by this female. The male may try to interact with the other females, but they are usually unresponsive.

Most all-male units consist of several subadults and one young adult, led by one male. A member of an all-male unit may spend two to four years in the group before attempting to join a reproductive unit. All-male groups are generally aggressive towards both reproductive units and other all-male units. As in reproductive units, aggression within all-male units is rare. As bands, reproductive units exist in a common home range. Within the band, members are closely related and between the units there is no social hierarchy. Bands usually break apart every eight to nine years as a new band forms in a new home range.

Researchers from the University of the Free State in South Africa, while observing gelada during field studies, discovered that the monkeys were capable of &quot;cheating&quot; on their partners and covering up their infidelity. A nondominant male mates surreptitiously with a female, with both suppressing their normal mating cries so as not to be overheard. If discovered, the dominant male attacks the miscreants in a clear form of punishment. It is the first time that evidence of the knowledge of cheating and fear of discovery have been recorded among animals in the wild. Dr. Aliza le Roux of the university&#x27;s Department of Zoology and Entomology believes that dishonesty and punishment are not uniquely human traits, and that the observed evidence of this behaviour among gelada monkeys suggests that the roots of the human system of deceit, crime, and punishment lie very deep indeed.

Mixed-species association was observed between solitary Ethiopian wolves and geladas. According to the study&#x27;s findings, gelada monkeys typically do not move on encountering Ethiopian wolves, even when they were in the middle of the herd; 68% of encounters resulted in no movement and only 11% resulted in a movement greater than . In stark contrast, the geladas always fled great distances to the cliffs for safety whenever they encountered aggressive domestic dogs.

===Reproduction and parenting===

When in estrus, the female points her posterior towards a male and raises it, moving her tail to one side. The male then approaches the female and inspects her chest and genital areas. A female will copulate up to five times per day, usually around midday. Breeding and reproduction can occur at any time of the year, although some areas have birth peaks.

Most births occur at night. Newborn infants have red faces and closed eyes, and they are covered in black hair. On average, newborn infants weigh .

If a new male assumes mastery of a harem, females impregnated by the previous leader have an 80% likelihood of aborting, in a phenomenon known as the Bruce effect. Females come into estrus quickly after giving birth, so males have little incentive for practising infanticide, although it does occur in some communities in the Arsi region of Ethiopia, which may be an incentive for females to abort and avoid investing caring for an infant that will most likely be killed.

Infanticide in geladas remains fairly uncommon, though, compared to many primates that live in one-male units such as gorillas or gray langurs. The females that cancel their pregnancy are thought to bond with the new leader faster. When a male loses his position as dominant harem master, the females and new leader may allow him to remain in the social unit as a nonbreeding resident to act as a babysitter. This way, the ex-leader can protect any infants he had fathered from being killed by the new leader, the females can protect the infants fathered by him, and when the new leader faces a potential rival, the ex-leader will be more inclined to help support him in keeping rivals at bay.

Mortality among infants occurs at its highest in the wet season, but on average, over 85% of infants survive to their fourth birthday, one of the great advantages of living in an environment with a food source few other animals can exploit, so is unable to sustain many large predators.

Females that have just given birth stay on the periphery of the reproductive unit. Other adult females may take an interest in the infants and even kidnap them. An infant is carried on its mother&#x27;s belly for the first five weeks, and thereafter on her back. Infants can move independently at around five months old. A subordinate male in a reproductive unit may help care for an infant when it is six months old.

When herds form, juveniles and infants may gather into play groups of around 10 individuals. When males reach puberty, they gather into unstable groups independent of the reproductive units. Females sexually mature at around three years, but do not give birth for another year. Males reach puberty at about four to five years, but they are usually unable to reproduce because of social constraints and wait until they are about eight to ten years old. Average lifespan in the wild is 15 years.

===Communication===

Adult geladas use a diverse repertoire of vocalizations for various purposes, such as: contact, reassurance, appeasement, solicitation, ambivalence, aggression, and defense. The level of complexity of these vocalizations is thought to be near that of humans. They sit around and chatter at each other, signifying to those around that they matter, in a way, to the individual &quot;speaking&quot;. To some extent, calls are related to the status of an individual. In addition, females have calls signaling their estrus. Geladas communicate through gestures, as well. They display threats by flipping their upper lips back on their nostrils to display their teeth and gums, and by pulling back their scalps to display the pale eyelids. A gelada submits by fleeing or presenting itself.

In 2016, a research group at the University of Michigan found that gelada vocalizations obey Menzerath&#x27;s law, observing that calls are abbreviated when used in longer sequences.

==Conservation status and human interactions==
The gelada is considered a crop pest by farmers near Simien National Park. In 2005, they caused an average of of crop damage per animal. The geladas had a distinct preference for barley.

In 2008, the IUCN assessed the gelada as least concern, although their population had reduced from an estimated 440,000 in the 1970s to around 200,000 in 2008. It is listed in Appendix II of CITES. Major threats to the gelada are a reduction of their range as a result of agricultural expansion and shooting as crop pests. Previously, these monkeys were trapped for use as laboratory animals or hunted to obtain their capes to make items of clothing. As of 2008, proposals have been made for a new Blue Nile Gorges National Park and Indeltu (Shebelle) Gorges Reserve to protect larger numbers.

<text>In J. R. R. Tolkien’s fictional universe of Middle-earth, the Old Forest was a daunting and ancient woodland just beyond the eastern borders of the Shire. Its first and main appearance in print was in the chapter of the 1954 &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; titled &quot;The Old Forest&quot;. The hobbits of the Shire found the forest hostile and dangerous; the nearest, the Bucklanders, planted a great hedge to border the forest and cleared a strip of land next to it. A malign tree-spirit, Old Man Willow, grew beside the River Withywindle in the centre of the forest, controlling most of it. 

The scholar Verlyn Flieger has observed that the hostility of the Old Forest and of Old Man Willow contradicts Tolkien&#x27;s otherwise protective stance for wild nature. Scholars have discussed the symbolism of the Old Forest, likening it to &quot;Old England&quot;, and, given that the protagonist Frodo Baggins calls it &quot;the shadowed land&quot;, to Death.

==Fictional role==

===Overview===

The Old Forest lay near the centre of Eriador, a large region of north-west Middle-earth. It was one of the few survivors of the primordial forests which had covered much of Eriador before the Second Age. Indeed, it had once been but the northern edge of one immense forest which reached all the way to Fangorn forest, hundreds of miles to the south-east.

The vicinity of the Old Forest was the domain of three nature-spirits: Tom Bombadil, Goldberry, and Old Man Willow. The powers of these beings doubtless contributed to its survival when other forests were destroyed.

Old Man Willow, along with the Barrow-wight and Tom Bombadil himself, first appeared in Tolkien&#x27;s narrative poem &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;, where Old Man Willow trapped Bombadil himself briefly. Willow is portrayed as a sentient and evil willow tree with powers including hypnosis and the ability to move his roots and trunk. Some characters of the story speculate that he may have been related to the Ents, or possibly the Huorns. However, unlike Ents or Huorns, he is portrayed more like a tree, with roots in the ground, and without the ability to move from place to place. Tom Bombadil had power over Old Man Willow, and checked the evil as much as he could, or was willing.

According to Tom Bombadil, at the dawn of time, long before even the Awakening of the Elves, trees were the only inhabitants of vast stretches of the world. Because the Elves awoke far in the East, it was still a considerable time before any other beings spread into the vast primeval forests of western Middle-earth. A handful of trees survived from this time until the present day, who are angered at the encroachment of Elves and Men and their dominion over the earth; trees who bitterly remember a time long ago when they were as Lords of vast regions of the world. Bombadil relates that of the corrupted trees of the Old Forest, &quot;none were more dangerous than the Great Willow; his heart was rotten, but his strength was green; and he was cunning, and a master of winds, and his song and thought ran through the woods on both sides of the river. His grey thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth and spread like fine root-threads in the ground, and invisible twig-fingers in the air, till it had under its dominion nearly all the trees of the Forest from the Hedge to the Downs.&quot;

In the First Age, Tom Bombadil &quot;was here before the river and the trees&quot;. In the Spring of Arda, plants emerge, possibly including Old Man Willow. In the Years of the Trees, Elves skirted the forest on their primeval migration to Beleriand and the West; they were observed by Bombadil. 

By the time Sauron had been defeated and driven from Eriador, most of its old forests had already been destroyed, leaving remnants such as the Old Forest. (Other vestiges included Woody End in the Shire, Chetwood in Bree-land, and Eryn Vorn in Minhiriath.) The Old Forest was now &quot;hostile to two legged creatures because of the memory of many injuries.&quot;

=== Geography, flora and fauna ===


The Old Forest was about 1,000 square miles in area (some 2,600 km2). It was bordered on the east by the Barrow-downs, a hilly area dotted with ancient burial mounds, where Frodo&#x27;s party encountered the Barrow-wight. In the north it reached towards the Great East Road, and in the west and south it approached the Brandywine river. The Withywindle, a tributary of the Brandywine, ran through the heart of the forest, which covered most of the Withywindle&#x27;s drainage basin.

This was also a &#x27;catchment area&#x27; in another sense. The landscape, trees and bushes were aligned so that if any strangers attempted to traverse the forest, then they were funnelled towards the Withywindle, and into the clutches of Old Man Willow in particular. The valley of the Withywindle within the Old Forest was known as the Dingle.

The Old Forest was a type of woodland nowadays described as temperate broadleaf and mixed forest. The west and south of the forest was dominated by &quot;oaks and ashes and other strange trees&quot;, which were generally replaced by pines and firs in the north. Beeches and alders were found here and there in the forest, and willows were dominant along the Withywindle.

Many of the trees were covered &quot;with moss and slimy, shaggy growths&quot;. The understorey was congested with bushes and other undergrowth, including brambles. A variety of plants grew in the forest&#x27;s occasional glades: grass, hemlocks, wood-parsley, fire-weed, nettles and thistles.

===Hobbits and the Old Forest===

In one of his letters, Tolkien explained that &quot;the Old Forest was hostile to two-legged creatures because of the memory of many injuries.&quot; When Gorhendad Oldbuck and his clan of Hobbits settled Buckland, they began to encroach upon the Old Forest, thus re-awakening the hostility that had first been aroused back in the Second Age. The settlers soon found themselves under threat from the forest. They felt that the trees of the Old Forest were in some manner &#x27;awake&#x27;, and were hostile. The trees swayed when there was no wind and whispered at night, and they daunted intruding hobbits by tripping them, dropping branches, and driving them deeper into the forest. Deep within the Old Forest was the Withywindle Valley, the root of all the terrors of the forest; it could be a dark, evil and malevolent place.

The Bucklanders therefore planted and maintained a great Hedge (also known as the High Hay) all the way along Buckland&#x27;s eastern border, which ran right along the edge of the forest. This had occurred &quot;many generations&quot; before the War of the Ring.

However at length (but still &quot;long ago&quot; before the War of the Ring), the Bucklanders found that the Hedge was under &quot;attack&quot; by the forest. Trees began to plant themselves against the Hedge and lean over it. To counter this attack, the hobbits cleared a narrow strip of land on the outside of the Hedge, felling and burning many trees. They cleared a space some way inside the forest; this later became known as the Bonfire Glade.

The ruling family of Buckland, the Brandybucks, owned a private gate in the Hedge, through which they occasionally dared the threshold of the Old Forest. They also went in to maintain the cleared strip, which was still in existence during the War of the Ring. At least one non-Brandybuck visited the Old Forest: Farmer Maggot.

The heir of the Brandybucks during the War of the Ring was Merry Brandybuck: a member of the Fellowship of the Ring. He had been into the Old Forest &quot;several times&quot;, and had a key to the gate. On Merry&#x27;s advice, Frodo Baggins (the bearer of the One Ring) decided to attempt a traversal of the dreadful forest in order to evade the pursuit of Black Riders.

===Old Man Willow===

Old Man Willow is a malign tree-spirit of great age in Tom Bombadil&#x27;s Old Forest, appearing physically as a large willow tree beside the River Withywindle, but spreading his influence throughout the forest. He casts a spell on the hobbits, trapping two of them; they are rescued by Tom Bombadil. Bombadil explains that the tree was wholly evil, and had grown to control most of the Old Forest. Tolkien made a drawing of Old Man Willow, from an unpollarded tree by the river in Oxford, to support his writing. The evil tree has puzzled critics, as it does not fit with Tolkien&#x27;s image as an environmentalist &quot;tree-hugger&quot;; others have noted that trees too are seen by Christians as affected by the Biblical Fall of Man.

== Analysis ==

=== Turning to evil ===

The Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger has observed that the Old Forest contradicts Tolkien&#x27;s protective stance for wild nature and his positive views of trees in particular. Indeed, although the Hobbits in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; had close shaves with the Black Riders, the first real antagonist which they encountered directly is Old Man Willow. She writes also that the Bucklanders cutting and burning of hundreds of trees along the Hedge is not different from the destruction caused by Saruman&#x27;s orcs in the woods around Orthanc. 
She notes further that Old Man Willow first appears as &quot;a predatory tree&quot; in the 1934 poem &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;, and that the character is developed in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, as documented in &quot;The Return of the Shadow&quot;. In an early draft from 1938, she writes, the &quot;Willow&quot; tree and the &quot;Old Man&quot; character had not yet become a single &quot;indivisible being&quot;. Instead, Tolkien writes of &quot;how that grey thirsty earth-bound spirit had become imprisoned in the greatest Willow of the [Old] Forest.&quot; Flieger writes that in this draft and in the 1943 &quot;Manuscript B&quot;, Tolkien links &quot;a tree and a spirit, a &#x27;non-incarnate mind&#x27;&quot; which is &quot;imprisoned&quot; in an individual tree. She comments that Tolkien solved the problem of how a spirit might become trapped in this way by turning them into a single being, at once a tree and a malevolent spirit. Old Man Willow is accompanied in the Old Forest, she writes, by &quot;trees&quot; that do what ordinary trees do – &quot;dropping branches, sticking up roots&quot;, but which appear to be reacting to the presence of the hobbits, &quot;giving an impression of motivation and intent that is enhanced by the ominous crowding that herds the hobbits &#x27;eastwards and southwards, into the heart of the forest&#x27;&quot;, exactly where they do not wish to go.

Tolkien wrote that all inhabitants of Ea can be corrupted, and even &quot;trees may &#x27;go bad&#x27;&quot;. Matthew Dickerson notes in the &quot;J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot; that Old Man Willow is a prime example.

=== Other symbolism ===

Tolkien&#x27;s Old Forest has been compared to &quot;Old England&quot; in John Buchan&#x27;s 1931 &quot;The Blanket of the Dark&quot;, where the protagonist Peter Bohun disappears in the English Midlands around Evesham. The West Midlands were beloved by Tolkien because the maternal part of his family, the Suffields, were from this area.

Tom Shippey has proposed that the Old Forest contains a more fundamental symbolism. Frodo, the central protagonist of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, describes the forest as &quot;the shadowed land&quot;; Shippey draws on the context to suggest that the forest could be an allusion to Death.

John Garth writes that the name &quot;Old Forest&quot; seems plain, but is &quot;pregnant&quot; with meaning: &quot;Forest&quot; derives from medieval Latin &quot;forestem silvam&quot;, &quot;the outside wood&quot;, in turn from Latin &quot;foris&quot;, &quot;out of doors&quot;. He glosses this as meaning unfenced woodland, noting that the Old Forest is &quot;very emphatically fenced &quot;out&quot; by a strip of scorched earth and a high hedge, to deter the seemingly mobile trees from invading Buckland&quot;.

==Adaptations==

The forest appears in the video game &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. In the MMORPG &quot;Lord of the Rings Online&quot;, a quest to gather lilies for Goldberry at the foot of Old Man Willow is given to the player by Bombadil, who warns that the tree will &quot;sing you right to sleep&quot;. Along with the adventure in Crickhollow, Tom Bombadil, and the Barrow-downs, the Old Forest is omitted from Peter Jackson&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

<doc id="484950" wikidata="Q7010214" url="?curid=484950" title="New Mexico Military Institute">
<text>New Mexico Military Institute (NMMI) is a public military junior college and high school in Roswell, New Mexico. Founded in 1891, NMMI operates under the auspices of the State of New Mexico, under a dedicated Board of Regents that reports to the Governor of New Mexico. Located in downtown Roswell, NMMI enrolls nearly 1,000 cadets at the junior college and high school levels each year. NMMI is the only state-supported military college located in the western United States and has many notable alumni who have served at senior levels in the military and private sector.

The school&#x27;s two-year Army ROTC Early Commissioning Program (ECP) commissions approximately 30 cadets annually as U.S. Army second lieutenants, and almost 100 cadets each year go to one of the five United States Service academies.

The Cadet Honor Code, which was unanimously voted into place by the Corps of Cadets in 1921, states, &quot;A Cadet Will Not Lie, Cheat, or Steal, Nor Tolerate Those Who Do&quot; and is administered by an honor board of cadets, advised by cadre and staff. The school&#x27;s athletic teams are the Broncos (junior college) and the Colts (high school), and its colors are scarlet and black.

==History==
New Mexico Military Institute was founded by Colonel Robert S. Goss and Captain Joseph C. Lea in 1891, originally as the Goss Military Institute, with an initial enrollment of 38 students. It was recognized by the territorial legislature and renamed NMMI in 1893. While the legislature had recognized the school, it failed to provide funding, and the school was forced to close its doors on &quot;Bad Friday&quot;, March 29, 1895. In the winter of 1894–1895 a funding bill was prepared and approved by the legislature. James J. Hagerman donated a tract of land which became the current location of the institute. The school reopened in the fall of 1898.

Hundreds of graduates served in World War I and World War II, including Medal of Honor recipient John C. Morgan and hotelier Conrad Hilton of the Hilton Hotels chain.

In 1948, the institute introduced a four-year liberal arts college program but discontinued it in 1956.

The school became fully coeducational in 1977, although some females had attended as non-cadet day students from 1891 to 1898.

In 2013, the institute broke off relations with the alumni association over disagreement about finances. Members of the alumni association claimed that this was an effort by the school to gain access and control of the over $5.2 million in assets of the association. On June 10, 2013, the school filed a lawsuit in Chaves County to take control of the assets of the alumni association. Editorial response to the institute&#x27;s actions has been generally negative, calling it a &quot;hijacking&quot; of the group and its resources. On April 21, 2015, the Fifth Judicial District Court found that the alumni association had not breached its agreement with NMMI and that NMMI had &quot;improperly terminated&quot; the agreement. The judge required the association to turn over the funds.

The current superintendent, Brigadier General (retired) Voris W. McBurnette, was appointed on June 6, 2024.

==Campus==
The original area of land for the campus was donated to the school by local rancher James J. Hagerman, for whom the main barracks complex is named. The institute&#x27;s buildings are made in a uniform Gothic Revival style out of buff brick. Its architecture and organization was inspired by the Virginia Military Institute. The campus is a designated area on the National Register of Historic Places.
==Cadet life==
Cadets are organized into a Corps of Cadets, following the organization of a cavalry regiment with a Headquarters Troop that comprises the Marching Band. The regiment comprises three squadrons consisting of four to five troops each. Cadets are structured into classes, 6th Class (9th grade high school equivalent) through 1st Class (college sophomore). Cadets are all treated on the basis of earned merit. The military boarding school environment is maintained by the cadet leadership, with all academic classes, meals, and military and physical training occurring &quot;on post&quot; (on campus) in a controlled environment. Based on the rank structure of the Virginia Military Institute, cadets start out as New Cadets, also known as RATs (recruits at training). College and high school cadets are RATs for one semester, then the next semester are known as yearlings, and after the one year mark they are called Old Cadets. Cadets also earn Junior or Senior Army ROTC positions outside of the Corps, although starting in the fall of 2022 school year, JROTC ranks and Corps ranks will be integrated. College and High School were separated in the Corps and in two different barracks starting in the fall of 2022 as well, except at the regimental staff level. These factors determine a cadet&#x27;s privileges and authority and define social interactions at the institute.

The rules of the institute for cadets are codified in the &quot;Blue Book&quot;. Minor offenses against these rules may result in simple correction of behavior or disciplinary measures like push-ups. Cadets with excessive demerits may be put on disciplinary probation. Cadets who fail to meet standards of academic performance are put on academic probation. Leaving the campus is generally only authorized on weekends, holidays, and during family visits.

All cadets live &quot;on-post&quot; (on-campus) in one of the two barracks.

The commandant and dean of students is COL Thomas Tate, who leads a group of staff that advises the leaders in the corps of cadets, and is responsible for cadet life at the Institute.

==Athletics==
NMMI athletic facilities include the recently renovated Cahoon Armory, Stapp Parade Field/Soccer Field, Godfrey Athletic Center, NMMI Ballpark, NMMI Football Field, Gene Hardman Memorial Tennis Courts, the NMMI Golf Course, the Outdoor Fitness Factory, and the Sports Medicine Facility.

Jose Barron has been the NMMI Athletic Director since July 2014. He was named the NJCAA Athletic Director of the Year in April 2022.

===Junior college===
The junior college sports mascot is the Broncos. The football team competes in the Southwest Junior College Football Conference with six Texas schools and one Oklahoma school.

====Football====
From 2021-2023, the head coach was NMMI alumnus Kurt Taufa&#x27;asau, a former NFL player. The Broncos won the 2021 NJCAA National football championship game, which was broadcast nationally on CBS. After the season, his first as head coach, Taufa&#x27;asau was named Coach of the Year by the American Community College Football Coaches Association, the NJCAA, and the Southwest Junior College Football Conference. Taufa&#x27;asau departed NMMI to accept the head coaching position at New Mexico Highlands University in early 2024. Oliver Soukup was selected as the new NMMI head football coach in June 2024.

====Other sports====
All of NMMI&#x27;s other college sports compete in the Western Junior College Athletic Conference. The women&#x27;s college volleyball team, coached by Shelby Fortchner, also competes in the NJCAA and were national runner-ups in the 2021-2022 season. They also have college golf, tennis, cross country, baseball and basketball teams at the NJCAA level, that compete under the Bronco name.

===High school===
The high school sports mascot is the Colts, and they compete in various divisions and districts in the NMAA, including football, soccer, volleyball, tennis, swimming and diving, golf, basketball, baseball, cross country, and track and field, competing with other New Mexico high schools in the region.

<text>The fili (or &quot;filè&quot;) (), plural filid, filidh (or filès), was a member of an elite class of poets in Ireland, and later Scotland, up until the Renaissance. The filid were believed to have the power of divination, and therefore able to foresee, foretell, predict – important events.

In an early society where most people were illiterate – including its hierarchy of chieftains, sub-kings and kings – the oral tradition was an important means of communicating current news and historical events. As both a poet and , the fili would hope to gain a professional reputation for the 
authenticity and reliability of their information.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;fili&quot; likely derives from primitive Irish ᚃᚓᚂᚔᚈᚐᚄ]VELITAS]; from Proto-Celtic *weleti (&quot;to see&quot;); and Proto-Indo-European *wel- (&quot;to see, perceive&quot;). 
An etymology from PIE &quot;welo- &quot; is offered by Matasović.
He notes: &quot;The semantic development of Olr.fil was from &#x27;Lo, behold&#x27; (lmpv.
of &quot;*wel-o-&quot; &#x27;see&#x27;) to &#x27;there is&#x27;. Olr.file [d m] &#x27;poet&#x27; is a derivative from this root (cf. Ogam Gen. sg. VELITAS). The original meaning was &#x27;seer&#x27;, PCelt. &quot;*wel-et-&quot;.&quot;
The word &quot;fili&quot; is thought to derive from the Proto-Celtic &quot;*widluios&quot;, meaning &quot;seer, one who sees&quot; (attested on the Gaulish inscription from Larzac as &quot;uidluias&quot;, which is the feminine genitive singular form), derived ultimately from the verb &quot;*widlu-&quot;, &quot;to see&quot;.

==Highest orders==

===Ollam===

There were seven orders of &quot;fili&quot;, the highest order being the &quot;ollam&quot;, which required at least 12 years of training. The ollam were required to commit to memory 250 major tales and 350 minor ones.
====&quot;Ollamh Érenn&quot; (Ireland)====

The &quot;Ollamh Érenn&quot; was the master poet of Gaelic Ireland (the whole of Ireland &quot;beyond The Pale&quot;). There was a hierarchy of master poets:
# Each túath (tribal territory) had its own ollam.
# Each province had a head ollam above the túath ollams.
# The &quot;Ollamh Érenn&quot; was the head ollam above all others.

====&quot;Ollamh rig Alban&quot; (Scotland)====
In medieval Scotland the &quot;Ollamh rig Alban&quot; – &#x27;Master poet of Scotland&#x27; – was an important member of the kings court. Whenever a new king was inaugurated, it was necessary for the Ollamh rig to recite the future kings genealogy, in order to verify his legitimate right to succeed.


====&quot;Do gairm rig&quot; (Dal Riata)====
The ancient traditions of the inauguration ceremony at Scone beside the River Tay in Scotland, including the recital of the future kings ancestry, probably originated from the Hill of Tara in County Meath, Ireland.

Those traditions were introduced into Scottish Dal Riata – from Irish Dal Riata – where the ceremony was known as &quot;do gairm rig&quot; ...&quot;Proclamation of the king&quot;. The Dal Riata community later moved east to the Perthshire region of Scotland, following Viking attacks on the west coast in the 9th century.
====Kenneth MacAlpin====
Viking attacks on the north east coast of Pictland resulted in a power vacuum, 
and an opportunity for Kenneth MacAlpin to become the first leader of both Dal Riata and Pictland. A new royal power base and inauguration site was created at 
Scone beside the River Tay.

===Seanchaí===

The term &quot;poet&quot; is misleading, because the filid were also &quot;seanchaí&quot; – historians – who advised chieftains and kings on political matters. The filid were believed to have the power of divination, and therefore able to foresee, foretell, predict – important events.

===Fear of satire===
The term &quot;poet&quot; is misleading, because the filid had extraordinary power and influence over the kings and political leaders who sponsored them. It was important for leaders to treat the filid with respect, and to reward them handsomely, in order to get good quality information on current affairs. The filid had the ability to portray their sponsors in a positive or negative way, and to influence neighbouring leaders.

At the darker and more extreme end of the scale – if leaders failed to treat the filid with due respect – they ran the risk of satire – a kind of blackmail – whereby the filid might ridicule them in front of neighbouring leaders.

The filid were believed to have the power of divination, and therefore able to foresee, foretell, predict – important events. It was also feared that they might have the power to influence future events.

==Classification==

===Irish storytelling===
The tales regaled by the &quot;filid&quot; were classified as:

===Irish poetry===
====&quot;Bérla na filed&quot;====
&quot;Bérla na filed&quot; – &quot;language of the poets&quot; – was possibly an esoteric mix of: 
# Latin 
# Hebrew 
# English
# Irish

==History==
===Elite scholars===

According to the &quot;Textbook of Irish Literature&quot;, by Eleanor Hull:

===Oral tradition===

The fili maintained an oral tradition that predated the Christianisation of Ireland. In this tradition, poetic and musical forms are important not only for aesthetics, but also for their mnemonic value. The tradition allowed plenty of room for improvisation and personal expression, especially in regard to creative hyperbole and clever kenning. However, the culture placed great importance on the fili&#x27;s ability to pass stories and information down through the generations without making changes in those elements that were considered factual rather than embellishment.

In this manner, a significant corpus of pre-Christian myth and epic literature remained largely intact many centuries into the Christian era. Much of it was first recorded in writing by scholarly Christian monks. The synergy between the rich and ancient indigenous oral literary tradition and the classical tradition resulted in an explosion of monastic literature that included epics of war, love stories, nature poetry, saint tales and so forth which collectively resulted in the largest corpus of non-Latin literature seen in Europe since Ancient Greece.

===Decline===

The ultimate accommodation of Christianity within Irish Gaelic society resulted in a strain on the resources of the Chiefs and in that they were required to provide land and titles for both fili and bishop alike. Consequently, a decision was made in the 6th century to limit the number of fili to certain families who were respected and believed to be poets as a birthright. The greatest of these families included the Ó Dálaigh (O&#x27;Daly), several of whom were accorded the rank of &#x27;chief ollamh of poetry of all Ireland,&#x27; and Ó hUiginn (O&#x27;Higgins) who were hereditary filí in more than one Gaelic house such as O&#x27;Conor Slighit, The MacDermotts, The McDonagh and O&#x27;Doherty. The Ó Cobhthaigh (Coffey&#x27;s) were known as the fili of Uisneach.

The Ó Maol Chonaire were chiefly Ollamhs of the Síol Muireadhaigh, the Ó Conchubhair Donn and the MacDermot of Moylurg, although this family was also associated with Ulster and spread from Connacht into the courts of Munster and Leinster. Finally the Ó Cléirighs who served the O&#x27;Donnel chieftains of Tír Connell.

The hereditary poets that were a fixture of court life in medieval Ireland serving as entertainers, advisors and genealogists maintained practices of and enjoyed a similar status as the pre-Christian fili. But from the 12th century onwards, Anglo-Norman elements had increasing influence on Irish society. As Gaelic culture waned, these folk became increasingly involved with written literature and such non-native traditions as heraldry. Nonetheless in Gaelic society the chief filí of the province, or Ollamh, was seen as equal status to the Ard-rí, or High King. This high social status existed right into Elizabethan times, when English nobility were horrified to see the Gaelic chieftains not just eating at the same table as their poets, but often from the same dish. Eventually classical literature and the Romantic literature that grew from the troubadour tradition of the langue d&#x27;oc superseded the material that would have been familiar to the ancient fili.

==Legacy==

Many manuscripts preserving the tales once transmitted by the fili have survived. This literature contributes much to the modern understanding of druids, Celtic religion and the Celtic world in general.

Besides its value to historians, this canon has contributed a great deal to modern literature beginning with retellings by William Butler Yeats and other authors involved with the Celtic Revival. Soon after, James Joyce drew from material less explicitly. Now fantasy literature and art draws heavily from these tales and characters such as Cúchulainn, Finn McCool and the Tuatha Dé Danann are relatively familiar.

Through such traditional musicians as Turlough O&#x27;Carolan (who died in 1738 and is often lauded as &quot;the last of the bards&quot;) and countless of his less-known or anonymous colleagues, the musical tradition of the fili has made its way to contemporary ears via artists such as Planxty, The Chieftains, and The Dubliners.

In their subject matter and techniques, the seanachie are considered the inheritors of the ancient Irish tradition of oral literature.

The modern Irish and Scottish Gaelic words for &quot;poet&quot; are derived from &quot;fili&quot;.

*Old Irish: fili, plural filid
*Modern Irish: file, plural filí
*Scottish Gaelic: filidh, plural filidhean
* Manx Gaelic: feelee

Finally, practitioners of Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism are working to reconstruct trance and visionary techniques that were used by the &quot;filid&quot;, such as &quot;imbas forosnai&quot; and aspects of the &quot;tarbhfeis&quot; ritual.

<text>A quesadilla (; ; Mexican diminutive of &quot;quesada&quot;) is a Mexican dish consisting of a tortilla that is filled primarily with cheese, and sometimes meats, spices, and other fillings, and then cooked on a griddle or stove. Traditionally, a corn tortilla is used, but it can also be made with a flour tortilla.

==History==
The quesadilla has its origins in colonial Mexico. The quesadilla as a dish has changed and evolved over many years as people have experimented with different variations of it. Quesadillas are frequently sold at Mexican restaurants all over the world.

==Types==

===Original Mexican quesadilla===
In the central and southern regions of Mexico, a quesadilla is a flat circle of cooked corn masa, called a &quot;tortilla&quot;, warmed to soften it enough to be folded in half, and then filled. They are typically filled with Oaxaca cheese (&quot;queso Oaxaca&quot;), a stringy Mexican cheese made by the &quot;pasta filata&quot; (stretched-curd) method. The quesadilla is then cooked on a &quot;comal&quot; until the cheese has completely melted. They are usually cooked without the addition of any oil. Often the quesadillas are served with green or red salsa, and guacamole. While Oaxaca (or string) cheese is the most common filling, other ingredients are also used in addition to the cheese. These can include cooked vegetables, such as potatoes with &quot;chorizo&quot;, squash blossoms, &quot;huitlacoche&quot;, and different types of cooked meat, such as &quot;chicharron&quot;, &quot;tinga&quot; made of chicken or beef, or cooked pork. In some places, quesadillas are also topped with other ingredients, in addition to the fillings they already have. Avocado or guacamole, chopped onion, tomato, serrano chiles, and cilantro are the most common. Salsas may also be added as a topping.
Mexican quesadillas are traditionally cooked on a &quot;comal&quot;, which is also used to prepare tortillas. As a variation, the quesadillas can be fried in oil to make &quot;quesadillas fritas&quot;. The main difference is that, while the traditional ones are prepared by filling the partially cooked tortillas, then cooked until the cheese melts, the fried ones are prepared like a pastry, preparing the uncooked masa in small circles, then topping with the filling and finally folding the quesadilla to form the pastry. It is then immersed into hot oil until the exterior looks golden and crispy.

Other variations include the use of wheat flour tortillas instead, especially in Northern Mexico. Wheat dough is most commonly used in place of corn masa. In this case, the flour tortilla is prepared, folded and filled with cheese (mainly Chihuahua cheese or &quot;queso menonita&quot;, a local cheese made by the Mennonites). The way of preparation is exactly the same as the corn variety.

In the cuisine of Mexico City, quesadillas are not assumed to come with cheese unless specifically requested. This is in contrast to the rest of Mexico, where quesadillas are considered to include cheese by definition (&quot;quesadilla&quot; literally meaning &quot;little cheesy thing&quot; in Spanish). This cultural trend cannot be traced back to a single origin. 

Sometimes, cheese and ham are sandwiched between two flour tortillas, then cut into wedges to serve what is commonly known as a &quot;sincronizada&quot; (Spanish for &quot;synchronized&quot;) in Mexico. Despite appearing almost the same as a quesadilla, it is considered a completely different dish. Tourists frequently confuse the &quot;sincronizada&quot; with the quesadilla because it is typically called a quesadilla in most Mexican restaurants outside of Mexico.

===United States quesadilla===

The quesadilla is a regional favorite in the southwestern U.S., where it is similar to a grilled cheese sandwich, with the inclusion of local ingredients. A flour tortilla is heated on a griddle, then flipped and sprinkled with a grated, usually high-moisture, melting cheese (&quot;queso quesadilla&quot;), such as Monterey Jack, Cheddar cheese, or Colby Jack. Once the cheese melts, other ingredients, such as shredded meat, peppers, onions, or guacamole may be added, and it is then folded and served.

Another preparation involves cheese and other ingredients sandwiched between two flour tortillas, with the whole package grilled on an oiled griddle and flipped so both sides are cooked and the cheese is melted. This version is often cut into wedges to serve. A home appliance (quesadilla maker) is sold to produce this kind of quesadilla, although it does not use oil and cooks both sides at once. This type is similar to the Mexican &quot;sincronizada&quot;; but in the United States, they often also have fajita beef or chicken or other ingredients instead of ham. That kind of quesadilla is also Mexican, and it is called &quot;gringa&quot; (the name varies in some regions in Mexico, including a type of quesadilla called &quot;chavindeca&quot;).

Regional variations to specific recipes exist throughout the Southwest.

===Variations===
Quesadillas have been adapted to many different styles. In the United States, many restaurants serve them as appetizers, after adding their own twist. Some variations use goat cheese, black beans, spinach, zucchini, or tofu. A variation that combines the ingredients and cooking technique of a quesadilla with pizza toppings has been described as a &quot;pizzadilla&quot;.

Even dessert quesadillas are made, using ingredients such as chocolate, butterscotch, caramel and different fruits.

Breakfast quesadillas are also made, using ingredients such as eggs, cheese and bacon.

<text>The Powder River Country is the Powder River Basin area of the Great Plains in northeastern Wyoming, United States. The area is loosely defined as that between the Bighorn Mountains and the Black Hills, in the upper drainage areas of the Powder, Tongue, and Little Bighorn rivers.

During the late 1860s, the area was the scene of Red Cloud&#x27;s War, fought between the Lakota peoples and the United States. The Lakota victory in the war resulted in the continuation of their control of the area for the next decade.

After control of the area fell to the U.S. government in the 1870s following the end of the Great Sioux War of 1876–77, the area was opened to white settlement for homesteading. From 1889 to 1893, the area was the scene of the Johnson County War.

In the early 20th century, the discovery of oil in the area led to the development of the area&#x27;s oil fields. Coal is also mined.</text><links>

<text>The Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor is one of the annual awards given by the American professional organization the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films. The Saturn Awards are the oldest film-specialized awards to reward science fiction, fantasy, and horror achievements (the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, awarded by the World Science Fiction Society who reward science fiction and fantasy in various media, is the oldest award for science fiction and fantasy films).

The category was first introduced for the 1984 film year, specifically to reward young actors and actresses in films, and was the first acting award of the Academy to reward both males and females. Tom Holland is the only actor to have won it three times, to have won it three years in a row, and to have won three times for the same role. Haley Joel Osment and Chloë Grace Moretz have each won the award twice. Moretz and Daniel Radcliffe have received the most nominations, with 5 each. Christina Ricci, Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst, and Tobey Maguire are the only actors to have won both Best Performance by a Younger Actor and later a Saturn Award for adults.

<text>Fried bread is a slice of bread that has been fried. 
It is used as a substitute for toast in various dishes or meals. Various oils, butter, lard, bacon drippings, or ghee can be used. Some cooks may choose to fry rather than toast to avoid having to give counter or storage space to or spend money on a toaster. Proponents of frying rather than toasting call out the extra flavor and crispiness that can be achieved by frying in fat rather than dry-toasting.

French toast is a type of fried bread that is coated in an egg and milk batter before frying.

== Nutrition ==
A small slice (35g) of fried bread has 174 calories.

== Around the world ==
Multiple cuisines include a dish that involves frying sliced bread. 

=== Brazil ===
Rabanada is a dish imported from Portugal and popular in Brazil as a Christmas dish.

=== Czech Republic ===
 or topinka is a Czech dish of pan-fried bread used to prevent wasting stale bread.

<doc id="484992" wikidata="Q1265702" url="?curid=484992" title="Saturn Award for Best Director">
<text>The Saturn Award for Best Director (or Saturn Award for Best Direction) is one of the annual awards given by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films. The Saturn Awards, which are the oldest film-specialized awards to reward genre fiction achievements, in particular for science fiction, fantasy, and horror (the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation is the oldest award for science fiction and fantasy films), included the Best Director category for the first time at the 3rd Saturn Awards, for the 1974/1975 film years.

==History==
The award is also the oldest to honor film directors in science fiction, fantasy and horror. It has been given 36 times, including a tie for the 1977 film year.

James Cameron holds the record of the most wins with six (for seven nominations), while Steven Spielberg is the most nominated director with fourteen nominations (for four wins). Only three other directors have won the award more than once: Peter Jackson (three times), Bryan Singer and Ridley Scott (two times). As of 2024, Cameron is the only director to have won the award two years in a row (having won at both the 17th and 18th ceremonies for &quot;The Abyss&quot; and &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, respectively). At the 22nd Saturn Awards, Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to win the award, and is one of three female directors to win the award (the others being Lana and Lily Wachowski). Roland Emmerich became the first of four LGBTQ person to win the award at the 23rd ceremony (the others being the Wachowskis and Singer), while John Woo became the first person of Asian descent to win the award at the 24th ceremony and Ryan Coogler became the first African-American to win the award at the 44th ceremony.

<doc id="484999" wikidata="Q713879" url="?curid=484999" title="Youtiao">
<text>Youtiao (), known in Southern China as yu char kway, is a long golden-brown deep-fried strip of wheat flour dough of Chinese origin and (by a variety of other names) also popular in other East and Southeast Asian cuisines.

Conventionally, &quot;youtiao&quot; are lightly salted and easily separated by hand. &quot;Youtiao&quot; are normally eaten at breakfast as an accompaniment for rice congee, soy milk or cow&#x27;s milk blended with sugar. Youtiao may also be known as a Chinese [[cruller]], Chinese oil stick, Chinese donut [sticks], and fried breadstick, among others.

In other Asian countries, they may also be called &quot;bicho, you char kway, cakwe, cakoi, kueh, kuay, shakoy&quot; or &quot;pathongko&quot;, among other names.

==Culinary applications and variants==
At breakfast, &quot;youtiao&quot; can be stuffed inside &quot;shāobǐng&quot; () to make a sandwich known as shāobǐng yóutiáo (). Youtiao wrapped in a rice noodle roll is known as &quot;zháliǎng&quot;. In Yunnan, a roasted rice flour pancake usually wrapped around a &quot;youtiao&quot; is known as &quot;erkuai&quot; (). Yet another name for a sandwich variant is &quot;jianbingguǒzi&quot; ().

&quot;Youtiao&quot; is occasionally dipped into various liquids, for example the soup &quot;xidoufen&quot;, soy milk (sweet or salty), and soy sauce.

Youtiao is also an important ingredient of the food &quot;cífàn tuán&quot; in Shanghai cuisine.

&quot;Tánggāo&quot; (), or &quot;sugar cake&quot;, is a sweet, fried food item similar in appearance to youtiao but shorter in length.

In Thailand, &quot;youtiao&quot; or &quot;pathongko&quot; () in Thai are eaten for breakfast with soy milk or porridge.

==Names==
===Cambodia===
In Cambodia, it is called &quot;cha kway&quot; () and usually dipped in &quot;kuy teav&quot;, congee or coffee. Some Chinese Cambodian immigrants in Australia sometimes call it chopstick cake because of its resemblance to a pair of chopsticks.

===China===
Although generally known as &quot;yóutiáo&quot; in Standard Mandarin, the dish is also known as &quot;guǒzi&quot; (餜子) in northern China. In Min Nan-speaking areas, such as Taiwan, it is known as &quot;iû-chiā-kóe&quot; (), where &quot;kóe&quot; (粿/餜) means cake or pastry, hence &quot;oil-fried cake/pastry&quot;. In Cantonese-speaking areas this is rendered as &quot;yàuh ja gwái&quot; (油炸鬼), where &quot;gwái&quot; literally means &quot;devil&quot; or &quot;ghost&quot;.

====Folk etymology====
The Cantonese name &quot;yàuh ja gwái&quot; literally means &quot;oil-fried devil&quot; and, according to folklore, is an act of protest against Song dynasty official Qin Hui, who is said to have orchestrated the plot to frame the general Yue Fei, an icon of patriotism in Chinese culture. It is said that the food, originally in the shape of two human-shaped pieces of dough but later evolved into two pieces joined in the middle, represents Qin Hui and his wife, both having a hand in collaborating with the enemy to bring about the great general&#x27;s demise. Thus the youtiao is deep fried and eaten as if done to the traitorous couple. In keeping with the legend, youtiao are often made as two foot-long rolls of dough joined along the middle, with one roll representing the husband and the other the wife. The Cantonese name may derive from Guangzhou being the last resistance front before the Song dynasty collapsed.

=== Indonesia ===
In Indonesia, the fried dough is known as &quot;cakwe&quot; (). It is commonly chopped or thinly sliced and then eaten for breakfast with &quot;bubur ayam&quot; (chicken porridge) or eaten as snacks with dipping of local version of chilli vinaigrette or peanut / satay sauce.

In Java, cakwe is usually sold as a street snack at kaki lima, usually at the same stalls that sell &quot;bolang-baling&quot; or &quot;roti goreng&quot; (sweet fried dough) and &quot;untir-untir&quot; (Javanese version of &quot;mahua&quot;). This snack is sometime served with spicy sweet salty sauce (optional). Savory cakwe, sweet bolang-baling and crunchy untir-untir are to be considered to compliment each other in a snack mix.

===Laos===
In Laos, youtiao is generally called &quot;kao nom kou&quot; or &quot;patongko&quot; (&quot;cf.&quot; Thai &quot;patongko&quot;) or &quot;chao quay&quot;, and is commonly eaten with coffee at breakfast in place of a baguette (&quot;khao jee falang&quot;). It is also eaten as an accompaniment to &quot;khao piek sen&quot; (chicken noodle soup) or &quot;jok&quot; (congee).

===Malaysia===
It is rendered in Malay language as &quot;cakoi&quot;, an alteration of the Minnan term, &quot;char kway&quot;. The name &quot;pathongko&quot; (see Thailand) is more common in the northern states of Kedah, Perlis and Penang, &quot;kayu khamak&quot; or &quot;kuduh&quot; in Terengganu, &quot;kocok&quot; in Pahang and Perak and &quot;cakuwe&quot; in Kelantan. &quot;Cakoi&quot; is usually sold in morning street markets or pasar malam night markets and commonly eaten with coffee or soy milk for breakfast or at tea time.

=== Myanmar ===
The youtiao is also a popular breakfast food in Myanmar (Burma) where it is called &quot;e kya kway&quot; (အီကြာကွေး [ì tʒà ku̯éː]). It is usually eaten with steamed yellow beans (with salt and oil) or dipped into coffee or tea, or with condensed milk(နို့ဆီ). E kya kway is also eaten with rice porridge, or cut into small rings and used as a condiment for mohinga. Tea culture is prevalent in Myanmar, and almost every shop will serve e kya kway for breakfast.

Some shops stuff meat into the youtiao and deep fry it over again. It is called &quot;e kya kway asar thoot&quot; – stuffed e kya kway.

=== Philippines ===

In the Philippines, it is either known as &quot;Bicho&quot; / &quot;Bicho-Bicho&quot; (Hokkien: 米棗 Pe̍h-ōe-jī: bí-tsó) or &quot;Shakoy&quot; / &quot;Siyakoy&quot; (Hokkien: 炸粿 Pe̍h-ōe-jī: tsia̍h-kué) / &quot;Pinisi&quot; / &quot;lubid-lubid.&quot; They are usually deep-fried, in the case of Bicho-Bicho, or deep-fried and twisted, in the case of Shakoy. Dry, smaller and crunchy versions are called &quot;pilipit&quot;.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, it is known as &quot;yu char kway&quot;, which is the transliteration of its Hokkien (Minnan) name (油炸粿 &quot;iû-tsiā-kué&quot;). Apart from the plain version, the Singaporean take on Youtiao also comes with various fillings which are either sweet, such as red bean paste or savory (ham chim peng, 鹹煎餅), such as sardines in tomato sauce. The plain version is often eaten with sweet chili sauce or coconut and egg jam called &quot;kaya&quot;, or served with bak kut teh (肉骨茶), porridge or rice congee, sliced thinly to be dipped into the broth or congee and eaten.

===Taiwan===
In Taiwan, Youtiao is often known by its Hokkien name (油炸粿 &quot;iû-tsiā-kué&quot;) and is a popular breakfast item throughout Taiwan. Youtiao are usually sandwiched into shaobings or cut into sections and wrapped in rice balls, or eaten with almond milk, soy milk, and douhua for breakfast. It is also an essential ingredient for Tainan-style congee and salty soy milk, and it is also an indispensable ingredient for Tainan beef soup and as a side for Taiwanese-style spicy hot pot.

===Thailand===
In Thailand, youtiao is generally called &quot;pathongko&quot; (, ) due to a confusion with a different kind of dessert. &quot;Pathongko&quot; is a loanword adapted from either Teochew Minnan &quot;beh teung guai&quot; (白糖粿; Mandarin: &quot;bái tángguǒ&quot;) or Cantonese of &quot;baahktònggòu&quot; (白糖糕; Mandarin: bái tánggāo). However, both possible original names referred to a different dessert, the white sugar sponge cake. It was previously sold together with youtiao by street vendors who normally walked around and shouted both names out loud. However, Thai customers often mistakenly thought that the more popular youtiao was &quot;&quot;pathongko&quot;. Eventually, the real &quot;pathongko&quot; disappeared from the market because of its unpopularity. The disappearance of real &quot;pathongko&quot; left the youtiao labeled under the former&#x27;s name, while the latter&#x27;s real name is generally unknown amongst the Thais. The original white sugar sponge cake can still be easily found in Trang Province in Southern Thailand under its original name while youtiao is still called &quot;chakoi&quot; or &quot;chiakoi&quot;&quot; by some Southerners.

In Thailand, &quot;pathongko&quot; is also dipped into condensed milk or, in the South, eaten with kaya. In some provinces, such as Chanthaburi and Kanchanaburi, &quot;pathongkos&quot; are eaten with sweet and sour dipping sauce, considered a local delicacy.

===Vietnam===

In Vietnamese cuisine, it is known by a name that is a pronunciation similar to the Cantonese pronunciation, as &quot;dầu cháo quẩy&quot;, &quot;giò cháo quẩy&quot; or simply &quot;quẩy&quot;. 油 (&quot;dầu/giò&quot;), 鬼 (&quot;quỷ/quẩy&quot;) coming from the approximate Cantonese pronunciation. In Vietnam, &quot;giò cháo quẩy&quot; is eaten typically with congee or &quot;phở&quot; in Hanoi, and sometimes with wonton noodle (&quot;mì hoành thánh&quot; or &quot;mì vằn thắn&quot;). In Southern Vietnam, quẩy is often enjoyed with &quot;bánh canh cua&quot;, or dipped in hot soymilk as a quick breakfast.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Recording (formerly known as Best Dance Recording) is an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for works containing quality vocal performances in the dance music and/or electronic music genres. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

The award for Best Dance Recording was first presented to Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder in 1998 for the song &quot;Carry On&quot;. In 2003, the Academy moved the category from the &quot;Pop&quot; field into a new &quot;Dance&quot; field, alongside the category Best Dance/Electronic Album. According to the Academy, the award is designated for solo, duo, group or collaborative performances (vocal or instrumental), and is limited to singles or tracks only.

The award goes to the artist, producer and mixer. The engineer and songwriter can apply for a Winners Certificate.

Skrillex has won the award a record four times, with Justin Timberlake, Diplo and The Chemical Brothers winning twice. Skrillex, Bonobo, The Chemical Brothers and Madonna share the record for the most nominations, with five. Bonobo also holds the record for the most nominations without a win.

==History==
Though she was not the first to suggest that the genre be recognized officially, Ellyn Harris and her Committee for the Advancement of Dance Music lobbied for more than two years to encourage the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences to acknowledge dance music. Some Academy members debated whether dance music, with its heavy use of layering, remixing, &quot;lack of melody or verse&quot;, and numerous varieties, was truly considered music. Others were concerned that dance music was not a long-lasting genre, fearing the category would face retirement much like the award for Best Disco Recording, which was presented for one year only at the 22nd Grammy Awards in 1980.

In 1998, Harris&#x27; efforts paid off when the Academy first presented the award to Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder at the 40th Grammy Awards for the song &quot;Carry On&quot;. While the Academy had once been quoted as saying that &quot;they considered dance music as something pop artists had created in their most frivolous moments&quot;, Ivan Bernstein, executive director of the organization&#x27;s Florida branch, insisted that an award for excellence in dance music would not exist &quot;if there were concerns about excellence&quot;.

Starting from the 64th Annual Grammy Awards in 2022, the category was renamed from Best Dance Recording to Best Dance/Electronic Recording. Starting from the 66th Annual Grammy Awards in 2024, a sister category Best Dance Pop Recording, was established in order to prevent well-established pop artists who incorporate dance music into their work from dominating the category over dedicated dance acts.

=== Criticism ===
Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys has criticised the award, saying &quot;there&#x27;s always been a sense that people just think you&#x27;ve pressed a few buttons rather than do real music, the Grammys [...] kind of diss two huge massive genres at the same time by putting them together&quot;.

Writing for Mixmag, Annabel Ross noted a lack of gender and racial diversity associated with the award, claiming that one &quot;might assume, judging by the winners and nominees [in the category] that the best dance music is made by white people (mostly men), and that commercial success is a marker of quality&quot;.

<text>An is a person who actively entices another person to commit a crime that would not otherwise have been committed and then reports the person to the authorities. They may target individuals or groups. 

In jurisdictions in which conspiracy is a serious crime in itself, it can be sufficient for the to entrap the target into discussing and planning an illegal act. It is not necessary for the illegal act to be carried out or even prepared.

Prevention of infiltration by is part of the duty of demonstration marshals, also called stewards, deployed by organizers of large or controversial assemblies.

==History and etymology==

While the practice was worldwide in antiquity, modern undercover operations were scaled up in France by Eugène François Vidocq in the early 19th century, and included the use of unlawful tactics against opponents. Later in the same century, police targets included union activists who came to fear plain-clothed policemen ( in French). The French term was then borrowed as-is into English and German. In accordance with French grammar, the correct plural form of the term is .

==Common usage==

An may be a police officer or a secret agent of police who encourages suspects to carry out a crime under conditions where evidence can be obtained; or who suggests the commission of a crime to another, in hopes they will go along with the suggestion and be convicted of the crime.

A political organization or government may use against political opponents. The try to incite the opponent to do counter-productive or ineffective acts to foster public disdain or provide a pretext for the final assault against the opponent.

Historically, labor spies, hired to infiltrate, monitor, disrupt, or subvert union activities, have used tactics.

==By region==

===Canada===
On August 20, 2007, during meetings of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America in Montebello, three police officers were revealed among the protesters by Dave Coles, president of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada, and alleged to be . The police posing as protestors wore masks and all black clothes; one was notably armed with a large rock. They were asked to leave by protest organizers.

After the three officers had been revealed, their fellow officers in riot gear handcuffed and removed them. The evidence that revealed these three men as &quot;police &quot; was initially circumstantial-they were imposing in stature, similarly dressed, and wearing police boots. According to veteran activist Harsha Walia, it was other participants in the black bloc who identified and exposed the undercover police.

After the protest, the police force initially denied, then later admitted that three of their officers disguised themselves as demonstrators; they then denied that the officers were provoking the crowd and instigating violence. The police released a news release in French where they stated &quot;At no time did the police of the Sûreté du Québec act as instigators or commit criminal acts&quot; and &quot;At all times, they responded within their mandate to keep order and security.&quot;

During the 2010 G20 Toronto summit, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) arrested five people, two of whom were members of the Toronto Police Service. City and provincial police, including the TPS, went on to arrest 900 people in the largest mass arrest in Canadian history. The RCMP watchdog commission saw no indication that RCMP undercover agents or event monitors acted inappropriately.

=== Europe ===
In February 1817, after the Prince Regent was attacked, the British government employed to obtain evidence against the agitators.

Sir John Retcliffe was an for the Prussian secret police.

Francesco Cossiga, former head of secret services and Head of state of Italy, advised the 2008 minister in charge of the police, on how to deal with the protests from teachers and students: He should do what I did when I was Minister of the Interior. [...] infiltrate the movement with inclined to do anything [...] And after that, with the momentum gained from acquired popular consent, [...] beat them for blood and beat for blood also those teachers that incite them. Especially the teachers. Not the elderly, of course, but the girl teachers, yes.

Another example occurred in France in 2010 where police disguised as members of the CGT (a leftist trade union) interacted with people during a demonstration.

===Russia===
The activities of against revolutionaries in Imperial Russia were notorious. Jacob Zhitomirsky, Yevno Azef, Roman Malinovsky, and Dmitry Bogrov, all members of Okhrana, were notable .

In the &quot;Trust Operation&quot; (1921–1926), the Soviet State Political Directorate (OGPU) set up a fake anti-Bolshevik underground organization, &quot;Monarchist Union of Central Russia&quot;. The main success of this operation was luring Boris Savinkov and Sidney Reilly into the Soviet Union, where they were arrested and executed.

===United States===
In the United States, the COINTELPRO program of the Federal Bureau of Investigation included FBI agents posing as political activists to disrupt the activities of political groups in the U.S., such as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the American Indian Movement, and the Ku Klux Klan.

The American Civil Liberties Union requested an investigation of Denver police at the 2008 Democratic National Convention where undercover officers allegedly staged a struggle with uniformed police to be removed from the crowd of protestors, which prompted another uniformed officer to use pepper spray.

A New York City police officer undercover in a 2013 motorcycle rally was sentenced to two years in prison in 2015 for second-degree assault, coercion, riot and criminal mischief for their participation in the gang assault of a man driving an SUV with his family, which had hit a motorcyclist and continued driving.

==Internet==
The internet has been utilized for information warfare, with many internet trolls acting as by disseminating certain propaganda. Such tactics are used to further the interests of countries, corporations, and political movements.

<doc id="485008" wikidata="Q2572014" url="?curid=485008" title="Kearsarge-class battleship">
<text>The &quot;Kearsarge&quot;-class was a group of two pre-dreadnought battleships built for the United States Navy in the 1890s. The two ships— and —represented a compromise between two preceding battleship designs, the low-freeboard and the high-freeboard , though their design also incorporated several improvements. Their primary advances over earlier designs consisted of new quick-firing guns and improved armor protection, but their most novel feature was their two-story gun turrets that consisted of a secondary gun turret fixed to the top of their primary turrets. The ships suffered from a number of problems, however, including a tertiary battery mounted too low in the hull and poorly-designed turrets, though the latter were attempted again with the in the early 1900s, also with negative results.

&quot;Kearsarge&quot; served as the flagship of the North Atlantic Squadron after entering service, while &quot;Kentucky&quot; was initially sent to East Asia. In 1904, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was temporarily transferred to the European Squadron, also serving as its flagship. Both vessels returned to the North Atlantic Squadron in 1905, and in 1906, &quot;Kentucky&quot; carried marines to Cuba during unrest in the country. Both ships participated in the cruise of the Great White Fleet around the world between late 1907 and early 1908, and after their return, they were modernized between 1909 and 1911, thereafter being placed in reserve. The two ships were reactivated in mid-1915 and &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was used as a training ship, while &quot;Kentucky&quot; was sent to participate in the United States occupation of Veracruz.

After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, both ships were used as training vessels for the rapidly-expanding fleet before being decommissioned in 1920. &quot;Kentucky&quot; was quickly discarded, being struck from the Naval Vessel Register in 1922 and sold for scrap the following year, but &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was converted into a crane ship. She was used in this capacity for the next twenty years, being involved in the recovery of the submarine and numerous warship construction, repair, and modernization projects. She was ultimately struck in 1955 and sold to ship breakers later that year.

== Design ==
Following the authorization of the battleship in 1892, the United States Navy failed to order new vessels in 1893 and 1894; this was in part the result of an economic depression in 1893 that reduced naval budgets, and also the views of the new Secretary of the Navy Hilary A. Herbert, who had opposed fleets of expensive battleships earlier in the decade. Nevertheless, the Bureau of Construction and Repair (C&amp;R) continued to work on new designs, and by 1893, Herbert had been convinced by Alfred Thayer Mahan&#x27;s seminal work &quot;The Influence of Sea Power upon History&quot;. In his requested budget for 1893, Herbert requested Congress appropriate funds for at least one new battleship. Congress delayed until 1895, when it authorized funding for two ships that were to become the &quot;Kearsarge&quot; class by the Act of 2 March 1895.

Work on the new design began immediately, and by late March, four proposals had been prepared. All four marked a compromise between the high-freeboard &quot;Iowa&quot; and the coastal battleships of the ; they had greater freeboard than the &quot;Indiana&quot;″s, but lacked the raised forecastle that had rendered &quot;Iowa&quot; an excellent sea boat. Coal storage, again, represented a compromise between the two. Armor protection was increased compared to the earlier vessels, which included an improved arrangement of the armor deck so that it protected a greater volume of the hull. The main battery was to repeat the guns used in &quot;Iowa&quot;, since they fired significantly faster than the 13-inch guns the &quot;Indiana&quot;s carried.

The designs varied considerably with regard to their armament. By this time, a new quick-firing gun had been developed, which significantly increased the offensive power of the tertiary battery. The designers initially considered adopting gun turrets for these weapons, but decided against it owing to the increased weight of such an arrangement, along with problems with ammunition magazines and fire control. All four designs arranged these in a central battery amidships, which forced the secondary battery of 8-inch guns to be pushed toward the ends of the ship. The four variants adopted different arrangements for these guns: &quot;A&quot; called for eight guns, two in centerline positions superfiring over the main battery and two wing turrets amidships. &quot;B&quot; discarded the forward turret and placed two wing turrets further forward and one superfiring aft; &quot;C&quot; retained the centerline turrets and discarded the wing mounts, and &quot;D&quot; opted for the reverse of &quot;C&quot;.

C&amp;R preferred the &quot;A&quot; design, since it maximized firepower, while the Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd) believed that none of the proposals was worth pursuing. An ensign in BuOrd, Joseph Strauss, developed a two-story turret that solved the problem; it would carry the 8-inch guns in a separate turret mounted directly atop (and fixed to) the main battery turret. Strauss accordingly proposed a fifth version, &quot;E&quot;, that incorporated his turret. Some officers questioned whether it was advisable that the 8-inch guns could not be directed against targets other than what the 12-inch guns were engaging, but Strauss pointed out that at long range, ships were relatively small targets, and at close range, the much greater reloading time of the large guns would permit the 8-inch guns to direct the rotation of the turret while the gun crews prepared the main guns. By this time, American naval engineers had made improvements to their gun turret designs and significant weight savings were achieved. In addition, the two-story, four-gun turret adopted for the &quot;Kearsarge&quot; class was lighter than the two-gun turrets used in the &quot;Indiana&quot;s of just five years earlier.

At the same time, BuOrd registered its opposition to what it viewed as a regression to 12-inch guns; while the 13-inch weapons were slower to fire, BuOrd estimated that they were 30 percent more powerful. Experiments with armor plate demonstrated that 12-inch guns could not penetrate that thickness even at the relatively close range of , while the 13-inch shells were capable of defeating the armor plate. C&amp;R refused to accept BuOrd&#x27;s objections, but further tests with a mock up of &quot;Iowa&quot;″s belt demonstrated that the 13-inch shells could easily defeat the armor, while the 12-inch shells were kept out. The Navy decided to adopt &quot;E&quot;, with 13-inch guns in place of the 12-inch weapons originally proposed.

The Navy repeated the two-story turret arrangement with the s designed in the early 1900s, with much the same reasoning, namely the goal of weight reduction and the belief that the faster-firing 8-inch guns could be operated without disrupting the 12-inch guns adopted for the &quot;Virginia&quot;s. A new, sloped turret design remedied the problem with the overly-large gun ports of the &quot;Kearsarge&quot; turrets, but the advent of large-caliber, quick-firing guns rendered the concept a failure, since the 12-inch guns fired nearly as quickly as the 8-inch weapons, and the latter could not be fired without severe blast effects disrupting the crew of the former.

=== General characteristics and machinery===

The two &quot;Kearsarge&quot;-class ships were long at the waterline and long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . They displaced normally, which increased to at full load. Like the &quot;Indiana&quot; class, the &quot;Kearsarge&quot; class also had a very low freeboard, amounting to forward under normal conditions, which resulted in her guns becoming unusable in bad weather. The ships&#x27; hulls incorporated a prominent ram bow, a common feature for battleships of the period.

Steering was controlled with a single rudder; while steaming at a speed of , it took &quot;Kearsarge&quot; to complete a turn to port and to turn to starboard. As completed, both ships carried two heavy military masts that carried some of the vessels&#x27; light guns, along with spotting tops to help direct the aim of their guns. &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was manned by 38 officers and 548 enlisted men, while &quot;Kentucky&quot; carried 38 officers and 549 enlisted men. Their complement was later adjusted to 40 officers and 513 enlisted men.

The battleships had two 3-cylinder vertical triple-expansion steam engines that each drove a single screw propeller. Steam for the engines was provided by five coal-fired Scotch marine boilers, which were ducted into a pair of funnels. The ships&#x27; engines were designed to produce a total of for a top speed of . During sea trials, the indicated horsepower and speed exceeded the design, with &quot;Kearsarge&quot;″s engines producing a total of for and &quot;Kentucky&quot;″s propulsion system reaching for . Coal storage amounted to normally and up to at full load. At a cruising speed of , the ships could steam for .

=== Armament ===
The &quot;Kearsarge&quot;-class battleships had two double turrets, with two /35 caliber guns and two /35 caliber guns each, stacked in two levels. The guns and turret armor were designed by BuOrd, while the turret itself was designed by C&amp;R. Since the turrets retained the vertical walls of the type used in the first generation of American battleships, the ports had to be very large to allow for sufficient elevation. Then-Lieutenant William Sims noted that the floors of the turrets could be easily seen through the ports, and claimed that as a result, a shell fired into the port could reach the magazines below, disabling the guns.

The 13-inch weapons were built-up guns of the Mark II type, mounted in Mark III turrets that were electrically trained. They were originally supplied with brown powder propellant charges that weighed nearly , later being replaced by smokeless charges. The shells had a muzzle velocity of , and at the muzzle, could penetrate up to of standard steel, and at a range of , could pierce of steel. The turrets allowed depression to −5 degrees and elevation to 15 degrees, which provided a maximum range of , though this was significantly in excess of what could be achieved with the rudimentary gunnery direction equipment at the time; BuOrd recommended that crews open fire at , and even this was optimistic. The rate of fire was one shot every 320 seconds, and the guns had to be returned to 2 degrees elevation to be reloaded.

The 8-inch guns were the Mark IV version, which had a muzzle velocity of . Also originally brown-powder guns, they, too, received updated smokeless charges in the early 1900s. The change improved the rate of fire from one shot per minute to one shot every forty seconds. Reloading was also fixed at 0 degrees. They were mounted in Mark IX turrets that were fixed atop the main battery turrets. The arrangement was adopted because the significantly higher rate of fire of the 8-inch guns was thought to reduce interference between the guns, but with the adoption of smokeless propellant and rapid fire for the main battery in the early 1900s proved this to be an incorrect assumption.

The turret guns were supported by a battery of fourteen 5 in/40 caliber guns mounted individually in casemates in the upper deck, seven on each broadside. Once the ships entered service, it was discovered that the central battery had been placed too close to the waterline, and the casemates were frequently washed out, rendering them unusable in all but calm seas. For defense against torpedo boats, they also carried twenty 6-pounder () Hotchkiss guns and eight 1-pounder () guns. These were also in individual open mounts distributed around the decks and fighting tops of the masts; eight of the 57 mm guns were placed in a broadside battery one deck above the 5-inch guns, four on either side. Four more were placed in casemates in the bow, and another four were similarly arranged toward the stern. The ships also carried a pair of M1895 Colt–Browning machine gun chambered in Lee Navy.

As was customary for battleships of the period, the &quot;Kearsarge&quot;-class carried four  torpedo tubes. These were placed in above-water mounts in the hull; two were placed abreast of the forward main battery turret and the other two were placed on either side of the aft superstructure. The tubes were supplied with a total of six torpedoes. They were initially equipped with the Mark II Whitehead design, which carried a warhead and had a range of at a speed of .

=== Armor ===
The ships were protected with face-hardened Harvey armor, an improvement over earlier compound plates. The main strake of the belt armor extended from the forward boiler room
to the aft main battery barbette, and covered a section of the hull from above the waterline and below the line. It was thick at the top, gradually tapering to at the waterline, and reducing further to at the bottom edge of the belt. Forward of the boiler rooms, the belt was reduced to a maximum thickness of , and from the forward barbette, slimmed further to . Transverse bulkheads that were forward and aft connected the belt on both sides of the ships. Above the main strake was a second one that was 5 in thick, extending from the forward to aft barbette.

The belt structure was reinforced by a curved armor deck that was curved at the sides and connected to the bottom edge of the belt. The flat portion of the deck was level with the upper edge of the belt, and it was thick. Forward, where the belt was significantly reduced in thickness, the deck was increased slightly to ; aft, where there was no side protection, the deck was more significantly strengthened, being 5 in thick. The conning tower had 10 in thick sides and a roof.

Armor protection for the 13-inch turrets amounted to on the sides and on the rear to balance the turrets, while the 8-inch turrets received on the sides and on the rears. Their roofs were and 2 inches thick for the 13-inch and 8-inch turrets, respectively. The turrets rested in armored barbettes that were thick. The 5-inch gun battery, which was placed directly above the upper belt, received 6 in of armor plating. The casemate battery lacked splinter screens between each gun, a significant shortcoming since a single hit could disable numerous guns.

===Modifications===
After the US Navy introduced rapid-firing for main guns in 1903, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; and &quot;Kentucky&quot; had automatic shutters installed in the ammunition hoists to prevent an explosion in the turret from traveling down to the magazines. After a propellant charge was accidentally detonated by an electrical short aboard &quot;Kentucky&quot; in April 1906, most electrical equipment was removed from the ships&#x27; turrets and additional precautions were installed, including bulkheads between the guns in each turret and gas evacuators in the breeches of the guns to prevent propellant gasses from blowing back into the turrets.

Between 1909 and 1911, most of the 57 mm guns were removed and four more 5-inch guns were installed. The original military masts were replaced with lattice masts, and the torpedo tubes were also removed. The ships also had their original boilers replaced with eight Mosher boilers. The ships underwent another refit by 1919 that included the removal of all but eight of the 5-inch guns. The guns that were removed were used to arm merchant ships to defend themselves against German U-boat attacks. A pair of  anti-aircraft guns were installed aboard each vessel. At some point in the ships&#x27; careers, splinter bulkheads were added to the 5-inch battery to improve survivability.

==Service histories==
=== USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot; (BB-5) ===
&quot;Kearsarge&quot; was laid down on 30 June 1896. She was launched on 24 March 1898 and was commissioned on 20 February 1900. From 1900 to 1905, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; served as flagship of the North Atlantic Squadron, except for a short period in 1904 when she was reassigned as flagship of the European Squadron. In 1905, the battleship replaced &quot;Kearsarge&quot; as flagship of the North Atlantic Fleet, although she remained with the fleet. In April, the ship suffered an explosion in her forward 13-inch turret that killed ten of its crew; Isadore Nordstrom and George Breeman both received the Medal of Honor, the former for rescuing several badly wounded men and the latter for preventing the fire from reaching the propellant magazines.

In 1907, the Great White Fleet was ordered by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt to circle the world as a demonstration of the might of the United States Navy. &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was attached to the Fourth Division of the Second Squadron. The fleet left from Hampton Roads on 16 December 1907, circled South America, passed through San Francisco, and arrived at Hawaii. From there they sailed to New Zealand and Australia, visited the Philippine Islands, Japan, China, and Ceylon before transiting the Suez Canal. The fleet split at Port Said to visit various ports, with &quot;Kearsarge&quot; leaving for Malta and Algiers, before reforming with the rest of the fleet at Gibraltar. The ships arrived back in Hampton Roads on 22 February 1908.

Between 1909 and 1911, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was modernized at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, and thereafter was placed in reserve. She was recommissioned on 23 June 1915 and operated along the Atlantic coast for the next two years as a training ship for naval militia from Massachusetts and Maine. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, she was used to train armed guard crews and naval engineers during cruises along the Atlantic seaboard. Following the end of the war, she continued training duties until being decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on either 10 May or 18 May 1920.

&quot;Kearsarge&quot; was converted into a crane ship, and was given hull classification symbol IX-16 on 17 July 1920, but it was changed to AB-1 on 5 August. Her turrets, superstructure, and armor were removed, and were replaced by a large revolving crane with a lifting capacity of , as well as blisters, which improved her stability. The crane ship was used often over the next 20 years, including the raising of in 1939. On 6 November 1941, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was renamed &quot;Crane Ship No. 1&quot;, allowing her name to be given to the aircraft carrier that was eventually renamed , and later to the carrier . She continued her service, however, handling guns, turrets, armor, and other heavy lifts for vessels such as the battleships , , and and the cruisers and . She was transferred to the San Francisco Naval Shipyard in 1945, where she participated in the construction of &quot;Hornet&quot;, the carrier , and the re-construction of the carrier . In 1948, she left the West Coast for the Boston Naval Shipyard. On 22 June 1955, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register, and she was sold for scrap on 9 August.

=== USS &quot;Kentucky&quot; (BB-6) ===

&quot;Kentucky&quot; laid down on the same day as her sister ship, and was launched the same day as well. She was commissioned on 15 May 1900. Later that year, she left for China to join the Eight Nation Alliance then in the process of suppressing the Boxer Rebellion. &quot;Kentucky&quot; arrived in East Asia in early 1901 and she saw no action during the final stage of the uprising. The ship operated in the region until early 1904. After returning to the United States, she joined the North Atlantic Squadron in 1905. During the 1906 Cuban Insurrection, she carried Marines to the island, embarking them in Provincetown and landing them at Havana, Cuba for the Second Occupation of Cuba.

In 1907, &quot;Kentucky&quot; participated in the Great White Fleet, as part of the Fourth Division with her sister. The fleet left from Hampton Roads on 16 December 1907, circled South America, passed through San Francisco, and arrived at Hawaii. From there, they sailed to New Zealand and Australia, visited the Philippine Islands, Japan, China, and Ceylon before transiting the Suez Canal. The fleet split at Port Said, with &quot;Kentucky&quot; visiting Tripoli and Algiers, before reforming with the fleet at Gibraltar. She returned to Hampton Roads on 22 February.

From 1909–1911, &quot;Kentucky&quot; was modernized at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. She was thereafter placed in reserve, where she remained until she was recommissioned at Philadelphia on 23 June 1915. Following the United States occupation of Veracruz, she sailed to Mexico, patrolling the coast off Veracruz until 1916. She then returned to New York, where she laid until the United States entered World War I. During the war, she operated as a training ship as part of the mobilization effort, training several thousand men along the Atlantic coast.

In late 1918 and early 1919, &quot;Kentucky&quot; was overhauled at the Boston Navy Yard. She then left for exercises in Guantanamo Bay, Norfolk, and along the New England coast, and later trained United States Naval Academy midshipmen. &quot;Kentucky&quot; was decommissioned on 29 March 1920; the Navy briefly considered rebuilding her into a crane ship as well, but ultimately decided against it. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 27 May 1922 and she was sold for scrap to Dravo Corporation on 24 March 1923.

<text>The &quot;Illinois&quot; class was a group of three pre-dreadnought battleships of the United States Navy commissioned at the beginning of the 20th century. The three ships, , , and , were built between 1896 and 1901. They were transitional ships; they incorporated advances over preceding designs, including the first modern gun turrets for the main battery, and new rapid-firing secondary guns, but they were also the last American battleships to feature dated technologies like fire-tube boilers and Harvey armor. They were armed with a main battery of four guns in two twin turrets, supported by a secondary battery of fourteen guns. The ships had a designed speed of , though they exceeded that speed by a significant margin.

The three ships served in a variety of roles and locations throughout their career. &quot;Illinois&quot; served with the North Atlantic Squadron and the European Squadron early in her career, while &quot;Wisconsin&quot; served as the flagship of the Pacific Fleet and then in the Asiatic Fleet. &quot;Illinois&quot; and &quot;Alabama&quot; started the cruise of the Great White Fleet in December 1907 from the east coast of the United States, though by the time they had rounded South America and stopped in California, &quot;Alabama&quot; was forced to leave the fleet due to machinery problems. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; joined the fleet there and continued on with it to the conclusion of its tour in February 1909. All three ships were modernized in 1909 and served in the Atlantic Fleet for a short time.

By 1912, all three ships had been reduced to the reserve fleet and were primarily employed as training ships. They continued in this role during World War I, training men to operate the machinery of warships and transports for the war effort. They were all decommissioned by 1920. &quot;Illinois&quot; was loaned to the New York Naval Militia and was converted into a floating arsenal. Renamed &quot;Prairie State&quot; in 1941, she was eventually sold for scrapping in 1956. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; was broken up for scrap in 1922, while &quot;Alabama&quot; was expended as a target ship in September 1921 in bombing tests with the US Army Air Service.

==Design==
Design work on what became the &quot;Illinois&quot; class began on 25 March 1896, when Rear Admiral J. G. Walker convened a board to consider future battleship designs. At the time, the only modern battleship in service was the low-freeboard ; the high-freeboard battleship and the low-freeboard were under construction. As the Navy had little experience with modern battleships, the question settled on whether to repeat one of the low-freeboard designs, which were suitable for coast defense, to build another &quot;Iowa&quot;, or to request a new design altogether. The Walker Board determined that another coastal battleship design would be imprudent, since the United States had long coastlines and therefore the new ships would need to have better seakeeping qualities than the &quot;Indiana&quot; or &quot;Kearsarge&quot; designs.

War games conducted by the fleet led the board to specify a draft of no more than to allow the ships to enter the comparatively shallow ports of the Gulf Coast. This limitation had a significant effect on the design; to meet it, weight would have to be kept to a minimum, which prevented copying the &quot;Iowa&quot; design outright, unless the main armament was reduced from to guns. The board was unwilling to make that concession, and so a new design would be required. In addition, the board had determined that the secondary gun was unnecessary, since though it could penetrate the thinner casemate armor on enemy battleships, it could not deliver a high-explosive shell through the armor. Instead, the board decided that a new rapid-firing gun would be superior. It would also simplify the ammunition supply, since there would be only one secondary caliber.

The board determined that the armor layout of the &quot;Kearsarge&quot; design was sufficient and adopted it without change for the new ships. They discarded the superposed turrets of the &quot;Kearsarge&quot;s, though, by mounting most of the secondary guns in a battery amidships. A new turret design for the main battery was adopted; instead of the old, round -style turrets of earlier ships, the &quot;Illinois&quot;&#x27; design featured a balanced turret with sloped armor on the face. Since it was balanced, it would prevent the ship from listing when the battery was trained to either broadside, as was the case with the &quot;Indiana&quot;s. The US Congress authorized three new battleships on 10 June 1896; the Bureau of Construction and Repair issued its requests for tenders from the various American shipbuilding companies twelve days later. Contracts for the new ships, to be named &quot;Illinois&quot;, &quot;Alabama&quot;, and &quot;Wisconsin&quot;, were awarded on 28 August.

===General characteristics and machinery===
The ships of the &quot;Illinois&quot; class were long at the waterline and long overall. They had a beam of and a draft of . They displaced as designed and up to at full load. As built, they were fitted with heavy military masts, but these were replaced by cage masts in 1909. They had a crew of 40 officers and 496 enlisted men. The crew increased to 690–713 later in her career. Steering was controlled with a single rudder, and the ships had a turning radius of at a speed of . The ships&#x27; transverse metacentric height was .

The ships were powered by two-shaft triple-expansion steam engines rated at . Steam was provided by eight coal-fired fire-tube boilers that were trunked into a pair of funnels that were arranged side-by-side. They were the last ships of the US Navy to use fire-tube boilers; subsequent designs changed to more efficient and lighter water-tube boilers. The engines generating a top speed of , though they exceeded their rated performance on trials, with &quot;Illinois&quot; reaching on . The ships could store up to of coal, which allowed them to steam for at a cruising speed of .

===Armament===
The ships were armed with a main battery of four /35 caliber guns guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. These guns fired a shell with a brown powder charge, though this was replaced with a smokeless powder charge, which produced a muzzle velocity of . The gun had a range of , though Navy regulations prescribed opening fire at ; even this was beyond the range at which gunners at the time could reliably hit. At a range of , the shells could penetrate of steel. The gun was slow-firing, requiring 320 seconds between shots. The guns were mounted in Mark IV turrets, which had a range of elevation of 15 degrees to -5 degrees. The turrets required the guns to return to 2 degrees for loading. Ammunition storage was 60 shells per gun.

The secondary battery consisted of fourteen /40 caliber Mark IV guns, which were placed in casemates in the hull. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . For close-range defense against torpedo boats, they carried sixteen 6-pounder guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull and six 1-pounder guns. These guns fired and shells, respectively. As was standard for capital ships of the period, the &quot;Illinois&quot; class carried four  torpedo tubes in above-water, hull mounted torpedo launchers. They were initially equipped with the Mark II Whitehead design, which carried a warhead and had a range of at a speed of .

===Armor===
All three ships were protected with Harvey armor; they were the last ships of the US Navy to rely entirely on Harvey steel. The ships&#x27; main armored belt was thick over the magazines and the machinery spaces and reduced to on the lower edge. It gradually reduced to toward the bow. Transverse bulkheads that were thick connected both ends of the central belt and the main battery barbettes. The ships&#x27; armored deck was thick on the flat portion, with thick sloped sides forward; the sloped sides aft were thick. The conning tower had 10 in thick sides with a thick roof.

The main battery gun turrets had thick faces and thick roofs, and the supporting barbettes had of armor plating on their exposed sides. The portion of the barbettes that were behind the belt armor were reduced to . Armor that was thick protected the secondary battery, and the lower half of the casemate armor was backed by coal bunkers, which increased the level of protection. Anti-splinter bulkheads that were thick were placed between each of the secondary guns to reduce the possibility of one shell from disabling multiple guns.

==Service history==
From their commissioning, &quot;Alabama&quot; and &quot;Illinois&quot; served with the North Atlantic Squadron. Both ships made visits to Europe during their early careers, and &quot;Illinois&quot; served as the flagship of the European Squadron for a short time in 1902. She accidentally ran aground outside Oslo, Norway, in 1902 and returned to the North Atlantic Squadron in January 1903. &quot;Wisconsin&quot;, having been built on the west coast of the United States, instead served in the Pacific Fleet as its flagship. In 1903, she was transferred to the Asiatic Fleet, and remained there until late 1906 when she returned to California.

&quot;Illinois&quot; and &quot;Alabama&quot; steamed with the Great White Fleet on its world cruise that started in December 1907. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; joined the fleet after it had rounded South America in July 1908; &quot;Alabama&quot; had to leave the fleet owing to engine damage that required repairs. &quot;Alabama&quot; was detached along with the battleship ; the two ships continued the journey independently and on a greatly shortened itinerary. The rest of the ships then crossed the Pacific and stopped in Australia, the Philippines, and Japan before continuing on through the Indian Ocean. They transited the Suez Canal and toured the Mediterranean before crossing the Atlantic, arriving bank in Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909 for a naval review with President Theodore Roosevelt.

The three ships were modernized after their return in 1909; from 1912, they were placed in reserve commission and employed as training ships for midshipmen from the US Naval Academy and naval militia units. They continued in this role through World War I, which the United States entered on 6 April 1917. The ships trained engine room personnel, armed guards for merchant ships, and other specialties. Following the German surrender in November 1918, most of the battleships of the Atlantic Fleet were used as transports to ferry American soldiers back from France. The &quot;Illinois&quot;-class ships were not so employed, however, owing to their short range and small size, which would not permit sufficient additional accommodations.

The &quot;Illinois&quot;-class ships served with the fleet only briefly after the war, still as training ships. By 1920, they had all been decommissioned. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; was sold for scrapping in January 1922 and broken up for scrap. &quot;Illinois&quot; was instead converted into a floating armory for the New York Naval Militia; renamed &quot;Prairie State&quot; in 1941, she served in this role until 1956, when she too was sold for scrap. &quot;Alabama&quot; met a more spectacular end as a target ship for bombing experiments conducted with the US Army Air Service in September 1921. She was hit with several bombs, including white phosphorus weapons and armor-piercing bombs, before eventually foundering.

<text>Deir el-Medina (), or Dayr al-Madīnah, is an ancient Egyptian workmen&#x27;s village which was home to the artisans who worked on the tombs in the Valley of the Kings during the 18th to 20th Dynasties of the New Kingdom of Egypt (ca. 1550–1080 BC). The settlement&#x27;s ancient name was &quot; &quot; (&quot;Place of Truth&quot;), and the workmen who lived there were called &quot;Servants in the Place of Truth&quot;. During the Christian era, the temple of Hathor was converted into a Monastery of Saint Isidorus the Martyr () from which the Egyptian Arabic name &quot;Deir el-Medina&quot; (&quot;Monastery of the City&quot;) is derived.

At the time when the world&#x27;s press was concentrating on Howard Carter&#x27;s discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922, a team led by Bernard Bruyère began to excavate the site. This work has resulted in one of the most thoroughly documented accounts of community life in the ancient world that spans almost four hundred years. There is no comparable site in which the organisation, social interactions, working and living conditions of a community can be studied in such detail.

The site is located on the west bank of the Nile, across the river from modern-day Luxor. The village is laid out in a small natural amphitheatre, within easy walking distance of the Valley of the Kings to the north, funerary temples to the east and south-east, with the Valley of the Queens to the west. The village may have been built apart from the wider population in order to preserve secrecy in view of sensitive nature of the work carried out in the tombs. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
==Excavation history==

A significant find of papyri was made in the 1840s in the vicinity of the village and many objects were also found during the course of the 19th century. The archaeological site was first seriously excavated by Ernesto Schiaparelli between 1905 and 1909 which uncovered large amounts of ostraca. A French team directed by Bernard Bruyère excavated the entire site, including village, dump and cemetery, between 1922 and 1951. Unfortunately through lack of control it is now thought that about half of the papyri recovered were removed without the knowledge or authorization of the team director.

Around five thousand ostraca of assorted works of commerce and literature were found in a well close to the village. Jaroslav Černý, who was part of Bruyère&#x27;s team, went on to study the village for almost fifty years until his death in 1970 and was able to name and describe the lives of many of the inhabitants. The peak overlooking the village was renamed &quot;Mont Cernabru&quot; in recognition of Černý and Bruyère&#x27;s work on the village.

==Village==

The first datable remains of the village belong to the reign of Thutmose I (c. 1506–1493 BC) with its final shape being formed during the Ramesside Period.
At its peak, the community contained around sixty-eight houses spread over a total area of 5,600 m2 with a narrow road running the length of the village. The main road through the village may have been covered to shelter the villagers from the intense glare and heat of the sun.
The size of the habitations varied, with an average floor space of 70 m2, but the same construction methods were used throughout the village. Walls were made of mudbrick, built on top of stone foundations. Mud was applied to the walls, which were then painted white on the external surfaces, while some of the inner surfaces were whitewashed up to a height of around one metre. A wooden front door might have carried the occupants&#x27; name. Houses consisted of four to five rooms, comprising an entrance, main room, two smaller rooms, kitchen with cellar and staircase leading to the roof. The full glare of the sun was avoided by situating the windows high up on the walls. The main room contained a mudbrick platform with steps which may have been used as a shrine or a birthing bed. Nearly all houses contained niches for statues and small altars. The tombs built by the community for their own use include small rock-cut chapels and substructures adorned with small pyramids.

Due to its location, the village is not thought to have provided a pleasant environment. The walled village reflects the shape of the narrow valley in which it&#x27;s situated, with the barren surrounding hillsides reflecting the desert sun and the hill of Gurnet Murai cutting off the north breeze, as well as any view of the verdant river valley.
The village was abandoned c. 1110–1080 BC during the reign of Ramesses XI (whose tomb was the last of the royal tombs built in the Valley of the Kings) due to increasing threats from tomb robbery, Libyan raids and the instability of civil war. The Ptolemids later built a temple to Hathor on the site of an ancient shrine dedicated to her.

==Historical texts of Deir el-Medina==

The surviving texts record the events of daily life rather than major historical incidents.
Personal letters reveal much about the social relations and family life of the villagers.
The ancient economy is documented by records of sales transactions that yield information on prices and exchange. Records of prayers and charms illustrate ordinary popular conceptions of the divine, whilst researchers into ancient law and practice find a rich source of information recorded in the texts from the village. Many examples of the most famous works of ancient Egyptian literature have also been discovered. Thousands of papyri and ostraca still await publication.

===Village life===

The settlement was home to a mixed population of Egyptians, Nubians and Asiatics who were employed as labourers, (stone-cutters, plasterers, water-carriers), as well as those involved in the administration and decoration of the royal tombs and temples. The artisans and the village were organised into two groups, left and right gangs who worked on opposite sides of the tomb walls similar to a ship&#x27;s crew, with a foreman for each who supervised the village and its work.

As the main well was thirty minutes walk from the village, carriers worked to keep the village regularly supplied with water. When working on the tombs, the artisans stayed overnight in a camp overlooking the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut (c. 1479–1458 BC) that is still visible today. Surviving records indicate that the workers had cooked meals delivered to them from the village.

Based on analysis of income and prices, the workmen of the village would, in modern terms, be considered middle class. As salaried state employees they were paid in rations at up to three times the rate of a field hand, but unofficial second jobs were also widely practiced. At great festivals such as the heb sed the workmen were issued with extra supplies of food and drink to allow a stylish celebration.

The working week was eight days followed by two days holiday, though the six days off a month could be supplemented frequently due to illness, family reasons and, as recorded by the scribe of the tomb, arguing with one&#x27;s wife or having a hangover. Including the days given over to festivals, over one-third of the year was time-off for the villagers during the reign of Merneptah (c. 1213–1203 BC).
During their days off the workmen could work on their own tombs, and since they were amongst the best craftsmen in Ancient Egypt who excavated and decorated royal tombs, their own tombs are considered to be some of the most beautiful on the west bank.

A large proportion of the community, including women, could at least read and possibly write.

The jobs of the workers would have been considered desirable and prized positions, with the posts being inheritable.

The examples of love songs recovered show how friendship between the sexes was practised, as was social drinking by both men and women. Egyptian marriages amongst commoners were monogamous but little is known about the marriage or wedding arrangements from surviving records. It was not unusual for couples to have six or seven children, with some recorded as having ten.

Separation, divorce and remarriage occurred. Merymaat is recorded as wanting a divorce on account of his mother in-law&#x27;s behaviour. Female slaves could become surrogate mothers in cases where the wife was infertile and in doing so raise their status and procure their freedom.

The community could move freely in and out of the walled village but for security reasons the only outsiders allowed to enter the site were those with good work-related reasons.

=== Women and village life ===

The records from this village provide most of the information we know about how women lived in the New Kingdom era. Women were supplied with servants by the government to assist with the grinding of the grain and laundry tasks. The wives of the workers cared for the children and baked the bread, a prime food source in this society. The vast majority of women who had a particular religious status embedded in their names were married to foremen or scribes and could hold the titles of chantress or singer, with official positions within local shrines or temples, perhaps even within the major temples of Thebes. Under Egyptian law they had property rights. They had title to their own wealth and a third of all marital goods. This would belong solely to the wife in case of divorce or death of the husband. If she died first it would go to her heirs, not to her spouse. Brewing of beer was normally supervised by the &quot;Mistress of the House&quot;, though the workmen considered the monitoring of the activity as a legitimate excuse for taking time off work.

=== Law and order ===
The workers and their families were not slaves but free citizens with recourse to the justice system, as required. In principle, any Egyptian could petition the vizier and could demand a trial by his peers. The community had its own court of law made up of a foreman, deputies, craftsmen and a court scribe, and were authorised to deal with all civil and some criminal cases, typically relating to the non-payment of goods or services. The villagers represented themselves and cases could go on for several years, with one dispute involving the chief of police lasting eleven years. The local police, Medjay, were responsible for preserving law and order, as well as controlling access to the tombs in the Valley of the Kings. One of the most famous cases recorded relates to Paneb, the son of an overseer, who was accused of looting royal tombs, adultery and causing unrest in the community. The outcome is not known but surviving records indicate the execution of a head of workmen at this time.

The people of Deir el-Medina often consulted with oracles about many aspects of their lives including justice. Questions could be put in writing or orally before the image of the god when carried by priests upon a litter. A positive response could have been indicated by a downward dip and a negative response by a withdrawal of the litter. When a matter of justice came up that wasn&#x27;t resolved by a tribunal, the god&#x27;s statue could be carried to the accused and asked &quot;Is it he who stole my goods?&quot; and, if the statue nodded, the accused would be considered guilty. However, at times, the accused would deny guilt and demand to see another oracle or, in at least one case when that failed, he asked to see a third. When guilt was determined, a judgement would be passed and the accused would have to make reparations and receive punishment. The Egyptians also believed the oracle could bring disease or blindness to people as punishment or miracle cures as rewards.

=== Medical care ===
The records and ostraca from Deir el-Medina provide a deeply compelling view into the medical workings of the New Kingdom. As in other Egyptian communities, the workmen and inhabitants of Deir el-Medina received care for their health problems through medical treatment, prayer, and magic. Nevertheless, the records at Deir el-Medina indicate some level of division, as records from the village note both a &quot;physician&quot; who saw patients and prescribed treatments, and a &quot;scorpion charmer&quot; who specialized in magical cures for scorpion bites.

Health texts from Deir el-Medina also differed in their circulation. Magical spells and remedies were widely distributed among the workmen; there are even several cases of spells being sent from one worker to another, with no &quot;trained&quot; intermediary. Written medical texts appear to have been much rarer, however, with only a handful of ostraca containing prescriptions, indicating that the trained physician mixed the more complicated remedies himself. There are also several documents that show the writer sending for medical ingredients, but it is unknown whether these were sent according to a physician&#x27;s prescription, or to fulfill a home remedy.

=== Popular piety ===


The excavations of the royal artisans community at Deir el-Medina have revealed much evidence of personal religious practice and cults. State gods were worshipped freely alongside personal gods without any conflict between national and local modes of religious expression.

The community had between sixteen and eighteen chapels, with the larger ones dedicated to Hathor, Ptah and Ramesses II. The workmen seem to have honoured Ptah and Resheph, the scribes Thoth and Seshat, as patron deities of their particular activity. Women had particular devotion towards Hathor, Taweret, and Bes in pregnancy, turning to Renenutet and Meretseger for food and safety. Meretseger (&quot;She Who Loves Silence&quot;) was perhaps locally at least as important as Osiris, the great god of the dead.

The villagers held Amenhotep I (c. 1526–1506 BC) and his mother, Queen Ahmose-Nefertari, in high regard over many generations, possibly as divinized patrons of the community. When Amenhotep died he became the centre of a village funerary cult, as &quot;Amenhotep of the Town&quot;. When the Queen died, she also was deified and became &quot;Mistress of the Sky&quot; and &quot;Lady of the West&quot;. Every year the villagers celebrated the Festival of Amenhotep I, where the elders acted as priests in the ceremonies that paid honour to their own local gods who were not worshipped anywhere else in Egypt.

Prayers were made and dedicated to a particular deity as votive offerings, similar in style to the Penitential Psalms in the Tanakh, which express remorse and thanksgiving for mercy. Steles record sorrow for human error and humbly invoke a god for forgiveness and mercy. In one instance Meretseger is petitioned to bring relief to one in pain. She answer the prayer by bringing &quot;sweet breezes&quot;. On another stele, a workman writes, &quot;I was a man who swore falsely by Ptah, Lord of Truth, and he caused me to see darkness by day. Now I will declaim his might to both the ignorant and the knowledgeable.&quot; Amun was considered a special patron of the poor and one who was merciful to the penitent. A stelae records:

Dream interpretation was very common.
A book of dreams was found in Scribe Kenhirkhopeshef&#x27;s library that was old even in his time. This book was used to interpret various types of dreams. These interpretations lacked precision and similar dreams often had different meanings. In many cases the interpretation was the opposite of what the dream depicted, for example a happy dream often signified sadness, a dream of plenty often signified scarceness etc.

Examples of how the dreams are interpreted include the following:
* If a man sees himself dead this is good; it means a long life in front of him.
* If a man sees himself eating crocodile flesh this is good; it means acting as an official amongst his people. (i.e. becoming a tax collector)
* If a man sees himself with his face in a mirror this is bad; it means a new life.
* If a man sees himself uncovering his own backside this is bad; it means he will be an orphan later.

Also in the temple to Hathor, a few of the craftsmen built stelae in honour of her. One such stela is the stele of Nefersenut, in which he and one of his son&#x27;s kneeling and giving offerings to her in human form.

=== Strikes ===

The royal building service was usually well-run, in view of the importance of the work it carried out. Paying proper wages was a religious duty that formed an intrinsic part of Maat. When this system broke down it indicated problems in the wider state. The coming of the Iron Age and the collapse of the empire led to economic instability, with inflation a notable feature. The high ideals expressed in the code of Maat became strained and this provided the background to workers unrest.

In about the 25th year of the reign of Ramesses III (c. 1170 BC) the tomb laborers were so exasperated by delays in supplies that they threw down their tools and walked off the job in what may have been the first sit-down strike action in recorded history. They wrote a letter to the vizier complaining about lack of wheat rations. Village leaders attempted to reason with them but they refused to return to work until their grievances were addressed. They responded to the elders with &quot;great oaths&quot;. &quot;We are hungry&quot;, the crews claimed; &quot;eighteen days have passed this month&quot; and they still had not received their rations. They were forced to buy their own wheat. They told the leaders to send to the pharaoh or vizier to address their concerns. After the authorities had heard their complaints they addressed them and the workers went back to work the next day. Several strikes followed. After one of them, when the strike leader asked the workers to follow him they told him they had had enough and returned to work. This was not the last strike but they soon restored the regular wheat supplies and the strikes came to an end for the remaining years of Ramesses III. However, since the chiefs supported the authorities the workers no longer trusted them and chose their own representatives. Further complaints by the artisans are recorded forty and fifty years after the initial dispute, during the reigns of Ramesses IX and Ramesses X.

=== Tomb robbing ===

After the reign of Ramses IV (c. 1155–1149 BC) the conditions of the village became increasingly unsettled. At times there was no work for fear of the enemy. The grain supplies became less dependable and this was followed by more strikes. Gangs of tomb robbers increased, often tunnelling into a tomb through its back so that they wouldn&#x27;t break the seal and be exposed. A tomb robbery culture developed that included fences and even some officials who accepted bribes. When the Viziers checked the tombs in order to determine whether the seals had been disturbed, they wouldn&#x27;t report the tomb as having been opened. When they finally did catch tomb robbers, they used limb-twisting tactics to interrogate them and obtain information about where the plunder was and who their accomplices were.

The Abbott Papyrus reports on one occasion, when some officials were looking for a scapegoat, they obtained a confession from a repeat offender after torturing him. However the Vizier was suspicious at how easily the suspect had been produced, so the Vizier asked the suspect to lead them to the tomb that he had robbed. He led them to an unfinished tomb that had never been used and claimed that it was the tomb of Isis. When they retrieved the plunder, they didn&#x27;t return it to the tombs; instead, they added it to the treasury.

==Deir el-Medina in fiction==
The French Egyptologist and author Christian Jacq has written a tetralogy dealing with Deir el-Medina and its artisans, as well as Egyptian political life at the time.

Deir el-Medina is also mentioned in some of the later books of the Amelia Peabody series by Barbara Mertz (writing as Elizabeth Peters). The village is the setting for some scenes, and late in the series the fictional Egyptologist Radcliffe Emerson is credited with excavations and documentation of the site.

<text>The three &quot;Maine&quot;-class battleships—, , and —were built at the turn of the 20th century for the United States Navy. Based on the preceding , they incorporated several significant technological advances over the earlier ships. They were the first American battleships to incorporate Krupp cemented armor, which was stronger than Harvey armor; smokeless powder, which allowed for higher-velocity guns; and water-tube boilers, which were more efficient and lighter. The &quot;Maine&quot;s were armed with four guns and sixteen guns, and they could steam at a speed of , a significant increase over the &quot;Illinois&quot; class.

The three &quot;Maine&quot;-class battleships served in a variety of roles throughout their careers. &quot;Maine&quot; and &quot;Missouri&quot; remained in the Atlantic Fleet for their careers, though &quot;Ohio&quot; initially served with the Asiatic Fleet from 1904 to 1907. All three ships took part in the cruise of the Great White Fleet in 1907–1909, though &quot;Maine&quot;″s excessive coal consumption forced her to proceed independently for most of the voyage. &quot;Missouri&quot; was used as a training ship for much of the rest of her career, and &quot;Ohio&quot; took part in the American intervention in the Mexican Revolution in 1914. All three ships were employed as training ships during World War I. After the war, all three ships were withdrawn from service between 1919 and 1920 before being sold for scrap in 1922 and 1923 and broken up.

== Design ==

By 1897, the US Navy had five battleships under construction, and no plans to request additional units for 1898. With the destruction of the armored cruiser in Havana harbor and the subsequent declaration of war on Spain on 25 April 1898, however, a large naval expansion program was passed through Congress. The program called for three new battleships, the first of which would be named for the destroyed &quot;Maine&quot;. Design work began immediately, though the broad parameters for the new battleships proved to be contentious. The Board on Construction advocated a design based on , to be armed with 13-, 8-, and 6-inch (330, 203, and 152 mm) guns, though others on the board argued that repeating the , which was armed with and 6 in guns and had a speed of , would save construction time. Additionally, they pointed out that 8 in guns could not be incorporated within the displacement limit.

Several important technological advances had become available by this time, however, which necessitated several changes to the design. The advent of smokeless powder permitted smaller guns with greater muzzle velocities; the Navy had accordingly designed a 12-inch (305 mm) 40-caliber high-velocity gun. In addition, Krupp cemented armor had been developed in Germany; the steel was a significant improvement over the older Harvey process. Since the steel was stronger, thinner armor plating could achieve the same level of protection and more importantly, significant savings in weight. Water-tube boilers were also now sufficiently reliable for use in warships. These were lighter and substantially more efficient than older fire-tube boilers.

Shortly after the three ships had been authorized, the Navy learned that the Russian battleship , recently ordered from William Cramp &amp; Sons in Philadelphia, would be capable of steaming at , a margin of over the &quot;Maine&quot; design. The Navy requested that the shipyards submitting designs for the contract increase the speed of their proposed ships to match the Russian vessel. Cramp &amp; Sons responded by lengthening the hull by to increase its fineness (and thus reduce drag) and incorporate new Niclausse boilers, while the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Company lengthened the hull by and increased the horsepower of the propulsion system by sixty percent, to . Ultimately, the Newport design was chosen for the new ships.

===General characteristics and machinery===
The ships of the &quot;Maine&quot; class were long at the waterline and long overall. They had a beam of and a draft of to . They displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ships had a metacentric height of . They had a forecastle deck that extended to the main mast. As built, they were fitted with heavy military masts with fighting tops, but these were replaced by cage masts in 1909. They had a crew of 40 officers and 521 enlisted men, which increased to 779–813 officers and men.

The ships were powered by two-shaft triple-expansion steam engines rated at . Steam was provided by twelve coal-fired Thornycroft boilers for &quot;Missouri&quot; and &quot;Ohio&quot;, and twenty-four Niclausse boilers for &quot;Maine&quot;, which were trunked into three tall funnels amidships. The ships&#x27; engines generated a top speed of , though &quot;Ohio&quot; only made on her speed trials. Normal coal capacity was , though &quot;Maine&quot; could carry up to , &quot;Missouri&quot; had capacity for , and &quot;Ohio&quot; could store of coal. At a speed of , the ships had a designed endurance of , though they could steam for at that speed. &quot;Ohio&quot;″s significantly greater coal capacity allowed her to cruise for at that speed. Steering was controlled by a single rudder, and the ships had a turning radius of at 10 knots.

===Armament===
The ships were armed with a main battery of four 12-inch/40 caliber Mark 3 guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The guns fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . The turrets were Mark IV mounts, which required the guns to be horizontal to be reloaded. These mounts could elevate to 15 degrees and depress to -5 degrees, and they were electrically operated, and the guns could be operated independently.

The secondary battery consisted of sixteen 6-inch/50 caliber Mark 6 guns, which were placed in casemates in the hull. Ten were mounted in a battery on the upper deck, four more were located in another battery directly above on the forecastle deck, and the last two were placed in sponsoned casemates in the bow. They fired a shell at . For close-range defense against torpedo boats, they carried six /50 caliber guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull, eight 3-pounder guns, and six 1-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, the &quot;Maine&quot;-class battleships carried two  torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside. They were initially equipped with the Mark II Whitehead design, which carried a warhead and had a range of at a speed of .

===Armor===
The ships&#x27; armor consisted of both Krupp cemented and Harvey steel. Their main armored belt was thick over the magazines and the machinery spaces and tapered down to on the lower edge. The belt was elsewhere and reduced to on the bottom edge. The belt extended from above the waterline to below. The main deck was thick and was increased slightly to on the sloped sides that connected it to the belt. The deck was increased to 4 in at the stern. The main battery gun turrets had 12 in thick faces, and the supporting barbettes had the same thickness of armor plating on their exposed sides. thick bulkheads connected the belt with the barbettes; behind these, the barbettes were protected with 8 in of steel. Armor that was 6 in thick protected the secondary battery. The conning tower had thick sides with a thick roof.

==Service history==
After &quot;Maine&quot; and &quot;Missouri&quot; entered service, they were assigned to the North Atlantic Fleet, while &quot;Ohio&quot;, built on the West Coast of the United States, was instead sent to serve as the flagship of the Asiatic Fleet based in the Philippines. In April 1904, a turret fire killed 36 men aboard &quot;Missouri&quot;, but the quick action of three men prevented the fire from reaching the magazines and destroying the ship, for which they were awarded the Medal of Honor. In 1907, &quot;Ohio&quot; returned from the western Pacific and joined her sisters in what was now the Atlantic Fleet. During this period, &quot;Maine&quot; served as the flagship of the Atlantic Fleet until she was relieved in April 1907.

In December 1907, the three ships and the other battleships in the Atlantic Fleet steamed out of Hampton Roads, Virginia, at the start of the cruise of the Great White Fleet. The fleet steamed south, around South America and back north to the US west coast. &quot;Maine&quot; was detached owing to her excessive use of coal along with the battleship ; the two ships continued the journey independently and on a greatly shortened itinerary. The rest of the ships then crossed the Pacific and stopped in Australia, the Philippines, and Japan before continuing on through the Indian Ocean. They transited the Suez Canal and toured the Mediterranean before crossing the Atlantic, arriving bank in Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909 for a naval review with President Theodore Roosevelt.

Over the following six years, the ships had fairly uneventful careers. &quot;Missouri&quot; spent most of the time out of active service, only recommissioning for summer training cruises with midshipmen from the US Naval Academy. In 1914, &quot;Ohio&quot; was sent to Mexican waters to protect American interests in the country during the Mexican Revolution. After the United States entered World War I by declaring war on Germany on 6 April 1917, all three ships were used to train naval recruits for the expanding wartime fleet. Following the German surrender in November 1918, &quot;Missouri&quot; was used to ferry American soldiers back from France, though the other two vessels were not so employed, since their short range and lack of sufficient accommodations would have made them inefficient transports. The three ships remained in active service only very briefly after the war. &quot;Ohio&quot; was decommissioned in January 1919 and &quot;Missouri&quot; and &quot;Maine&quot; followed in September 1919 and May 1920, respectively. All three ships were sold for scrap, with &quot;Maine&quot; and &quot;Missouri&quot; going to the breakers&#x27; yard in January 1922 and &quot;Ohio&quot; joining them in March 1923.
