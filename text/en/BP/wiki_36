<text>Cultivation theory is a sociological and communications framework designed to unravel the enduring impacts of media consumption, with a primary focus on television. At its core, the theory posits a compelling hypothesis: individuals who invest more time in watching television are prone to perceive the real world through a lens aligning with the prevalent depictions in television messages, in contrast to their counterparts with lower television viewership but comparable demographic profiles.

The premise hinges on the idea that increased exposure to television content, marked by recurring patterns of messages and images, cultivates shifts in individuals&#x27; perceptions. This transformative process extends beyond mere entertainment, playing a pivotal role in shaping the cultural fabric by reinforcing shared assumptions about the world. Cultivation theory, therefore, seeks to unravel the intricate dynamics of how prolonged engagement with television programming influences collective perspectives.

This theory believes that television has taken the role in which family, schools and churches formerly played in the society, which is the function of enculturation.

A notable validation of the theory&#x27;s significance emerges from a comprehensive 2004 study conducted by Jennings Bryant and Dorina Miron. Their examination, encompassing nearly 2,000 articles published in the top three mass communication journals since 1956, revealed cultivation theory as the third most frequently employed cultural framework. This underscores the theory&#x27;s enduring relevance and widespread adoption within the realm of mass communication scholarship.

== Origin and founders ==
Cultivation theory was founded by George Gerbner. It was developed to seek out the influence that television media may have on the viewers. Most of the formative research underlying cultivation theory was conducted by Gerbner along with his University of Pennsylvania colleague Larry Gross and their students-turned-colleagues Michael Morgan and Nancy Signorielli. Gerbner formulated his paradigm for mass communication in 1973 which included three types of analysis. The first type of analysis is message system analysis. Message system analysis aims to identify the content of message patterns in television and media. This includes the focus on gender, race, and ethnicity in relation to topics, such as violence. The second type of analysis is the cultivation analysis that is defined as the longitudinal surveys of people&#x27;s opinions on certain subjects with the key variable being levels of media reception such as television viewing. Most of the research under cultivation theory involves cultivation analysis. The third type of analysis is institutional process analysis, which looks at what institutions are supporting and distributing the content in media. These three analyses are known as the cultivation theory.

Cultivation theory began as a way to test the impact of television on viewers, especially how exposure to violence through television affects human beings. The theory&#x27;s key proposition is that &quot;the more time people spend &#x27;living&#x27; in the television world, the more likely they are to believe that social reality aligns with reality portrayed on television.&quot; Early studies of Cultivation Theory began with an interest in whether or not heavy television viewers were more likely to imitate violence that they saw. Current studies emphasize the conclusions that viewers draw about violence in the world around them. The traditional perspective of Cultivation Theory put emphasis on the overall viewing habits of individuals rather than their choice of genre. This was due to fewer choices that viewers had available to them. In light of changes in technology, simply examining the amount of viewing can be combined with choices in viewing. Gerbner believed that audience members used television to &quot;fill the gaps&quot; of their knowledge about certain experiences that have not occurred their own life experience. Because cultivation theory assumes the existence of objective reality and value-neutral research, it can be categorized as part of positivistic philosophy.

==Background==
Together, Gerbner and Gross were able to expand upon the cultivation theory and base it upon different core assumptions.

Cultivation theory is based on three core assumptions:

#Medium: the first assumption is that television is fundamentally different from other forms of mass media.
#Audience: cultivation theory does not predict what people will do after watching a violent program but rather posits a connection between people&#x27;s fears of a violence-filled world and their exposure to violent programming. The exposure to violent programming leads to what Gerbner calls the mean world syndrome, the idea that long-term exposure to violent media will lead to a distorted view that the world is more violent than it is.
#Function and effect: television&#x27;s effects are limited because it is a part of a larger sociocultural system. Therefore, although the effects of watching television may increase or decrease at any point in time, its effect is consistently present.
Cultivation theory suggests that exposure to media affects a viewer&#x27;s perceptions of reality, drawing attention to three aspects: institutions, messages, and publics.

Television, Gerbner suggested, binds diverse communities together by socializing people into standardized roles and behaviors; thus, television functions as part of the enculturation process. Gerbner&#x27;s research focused on the larger meaning of heavy television consumption instead of the meaning behind specific messages.

There are three orders of effect that come with the cultivation theory. The first order effects describe how people&#x27;s behavior changes when exposed to mass media. The second order effect encompasses the viewers&#x27; values and attitudes depending on what they are watching. The third order effect is the change in the viewer&#x27;s observation behavior.

=== Perceptions of Violence ===
Gerbner&#x27;s initial work looked specifically at the effects of television violence on American audiences. Measuring the effect of violence underscored the larger part of Gerbner&#x27;s work on cultivation theory. Therefore, he measured dramatic violence, defined as &quot;the overt expression or threat of physical force as part of the plot.&quot; Gerbner&#x27;s research also focused on the interpretation by high-use viewers of the prevalence of crime on television versus reality. He argues that, since a high percentage of programs include violent or crime-related content, viewers who spend a lot of time watching are inevitably exposed to high levels of crime and violence. Reality television is popular programming due to its dramatic displays of aggression, both verbal and physical. The programs, which are supposed to be actual accounts of an individual&#x27;s life, reinforce stereotypes of acceptable aggression for both males and females. Producers have the ability to shape the viewers&#x27; perception of reality by manipulating the events of the show. Fans of these types of programs believe that behavioral outbursts of celebrities are acceptable responses.

In 1968, Gerbner conducted a survey to demonstrate this theory. Following his previous results, he placed television viewers into three categories: light viewers (less than 2 hours a day), medium viewers (2–4 hours a day), and heavy viewers (more than 4 hours a day). He found that heavy viewers held beliefs and opinions similar to those portrayed on television, which demonstrated the compound effect of media influence. Heavy viewers experienced shyness, loneliness, and depression much more than those who watched less often. From this study, Gerbner then began to work on what would become the Mean World Syndrome, which is based on the fact that heavy viewers of television, particularly violence-related content, are more likely than light viewers to believe that the world is more frightening and dangerous than it actually is.

In 2012, people with heavy viewing habits were found to believe that 5% of society was involved in law enforcement. In contrast, people with light viewing habits estimated a more realistic 1%.

=== TV Viewing and Fear of Crime ===
In most of the surveys conducted by Gerbner, the results revealed a small but statistically significant relationship between television consumption and fear of becoming the victim of a crime. Those with light viewing habits predicted their weekly odds of being a victim were 1 in 100; those with heavy viewing habits predicted 1 in 10. Actual crime statistics showed the risk to be 1 in 10,000.

Supporting this finding is a survey done with college students that showed a significant correlation between the attention paid to local crime and one&#x27;s fearfulness. There was also a significant correlation between fear of crime and violence and the number of times the respondents viewed television per week.

Local news has been frequently analyzed for cultivation, as they rely &quot;heavily on sensational coverage of crime and other mayhem with particular emphasis on homicide and violence&quot;, while news agencies boast of their allegiance to report factually. Gerbner found that heavy viewers of news were more likely to overestimate crime rates and risk of personal exposure to crime and underestimate the safety of their neighborhoods. Additionally, several other studies point out the correlation between viewing local news and fear of crime, with Gross and Aiday (2003) finding the relationship between local news exposure and fear of crimes to be independent of local crime rates. Gerbner&#x27;s theory focuses on the collective mindset of television viewers&#x27; fear of crime based on the amount of television programs with this content. Some critics argue that this explanation does not take into account other variables that have the potential to change this conclusion. Variables such as age, sex, or educational level of individuals potentially influence viewers&#x27; beliefs about the prevalence of crime compared to what is shown on television. Some research findings indicate a higher cultivation relationship between television and fear of crime among whites, and a lower cultivation relationship among non-whites. This finding indicates that viewing images of violence in reality lessens the psychological impact of viewing violence on television. The assumption is that more whites may live in safer neighborhoods, and therefore television images have more shock value. Another consideration is that television viewers do not watch one type of genre, and therefore one must consider the influence violent programs within the total viewing experience of television watchers.

Aside from local news, national news, police shows, and general TV news viewing are also related to a fear of crime. Additionally, non-genre-specific TV viewing has been associated with fear of crime.

Busselle (2003) found that parents who watch more programs portraying crime and violence are more likely to warn their children about crime during their high school years; these warnings, in turn, increased the students&#x27; own crime estimates, suggesting cultivation takes place through both direct and indirect processes.

===Magic bullet theory===
A similar theory that examines media&#x27;s effects on individuals is the magic bullet theory. It is one of the first theories concerning mass communication. It is a linear model of communication concerned with audiences directly influenced by mass media and the media&#x27;s power over them.

It assumes that the media&#x27;s message is a bullet fired from a media &quot;gun&quot; into the viewer&#x27;s head. Magic bullet theory is also known as the hypodermic needle model. It suggests that the media delivers its messages straight into a passive audience&#x27;s body.

Harold Lasswell put this theory in place after World War 1. With the rise of media like advertising and movies in the mid 1900s, there was an apparent effect on people&#x27;s behavior.

==== Passive audience ====
Assuming that cultivation theory aligns with the magic bullet theory, several cognitive mechanisms that explain cultivation effects have been put forth by Shrum (1995, 1996, 1997). Shrum&#x27;s availability-heuristic explanation suggests that heavy viewers tend to retain more vivid memories of instances of television reality and more readily access those memories when surveyors ask them questions, resulting in more responses related to viewing, more quickly given. Another mechanism that might explain the cultivation phenomenon is a cognitive-narrative mechanism. Previous research suggests that the realism of narratives in combination with individual-level &quot;transportability&quot;, or the ability to be less critical of a narrative, might facilitate cultivation effects.

== Three analyses ==

=== Message system analysis ===
The message system analysis tells that the content that is displayed in television programs. Gerbner&#x27;s main focus of TV viewing was the depiction of violence in TV shows and movies. Using &quot;message system analysis&quot; as a tool helps researchers study viewer perceptions of reality, their perceptions of the observable world, and can evaluate transmitted media content.

Many theorists have extended Gerbner&#x27;s theory. Gerbner&#x27;s research focused on TV violence, but current research examines a variety of factors. Childhood viewing may be associated with overall self-esteem in children, and affect one&#x27;s beliefs as an adult.

Studies outside the US, where the programming is less homogeneous and repetitive, produced results that are less consistent. Australian students who watched US television programs (especially adventure and crime shows) were more likely to view Australia as dangerous; however, they didn&#x27;t perceive America as dangerous, even though they were watching US programs.

The cultivation effect is not specific to genre or program, but can result from cumulative exposure to stable patterns of content on television. Jonathan Cohen and Gabriel Weimann found cultivation more prevalent among teenagers and young adults, who may then exhibit cultivation longevity.

Viewers tended toward greater psychosocial health when watching no more than 2 hours of television each day, following recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), with an even greater impact on women. One study examined possible effects of viewing alcohol consumption in music videos.&quot;

Another study looked at interactive video games and found the viewer&#x27;s role within the game is essential in the progression of the story. Participants interacted with other players in real-time, with a strong showing of the cultivation of participants.

==== Dramatic violence ====
Gerbner&#x27;s initial work looked specifically at the effects of television violence on American audiences. In particular, he found the most common type of violence was dramatic violence. He measured dramatic violence, defined as &quot;the overt expression or threat of physical force as part of the plot.&quot;

The Coding of Health and Media Project or CHAMP, created a violence code book that defines Dramatic Violence that involves a character&#x27;s intentional physical pain on another character. This sort of violence excludes sports violence, natural disasters seen on the news, and or comedy violence such as boxing, verbal threats. CHAMP&#x27;s analysis also involves a quantification of the explicitness of violent acts with 1 being the least explicit to 5 being the most explicit, fatalities from violence, a definition for Comedic violence.

Shows such as &quot;Law &amp; Order SVU&quot; and &quot;&quot; use murder to frame each episode, underscoring the presence of gratuitous and dramatic violence. The idea of dramatic violence reinforces the relationship between fear and entertainment. Though death is being used as a plot point, it also functions to cultivate an image of looming violence.

=== Cultivation analysis ===
====Mainstreaming====

Mainstreaming, in the context of cultivation theory, refers to the process by which long-term exposure to consistent media messages can lead to the shaping of a shared social reality among heavy viewers. TV viewers from disparate groups develop a common outlook of the world through exposure to the same images and labels, the effect being stronger among those whose TV viewing is more constant. Heavy viewers of television, for example, tend to perceive the world in ways that are more congruent with the portrayals and values depicted on television. As Gerbner and Gross noted, &quot;Television&#x27;s cultivation of shared conceptions and beliefs exerts a subtle but cumulative influence on the audience&#x27;s judgments about reality&quot;. This theory underscores the idea that the media&#x27;s repetitive messages can influence and shape the perceptions and attitudes of the audience, potentially leading to a more homogenized worldview among viewers who consume a steady diet of such content.

====Resonance====

Resonance refers to the idea that long-term exposure to media content can shape individuals&#x27; perceptions and beliefs about the real world, leading to a correspondence between the media&#x27;s portrayal of reality and individuals&#x27; own understanding of it. Resonance can also be said to be the intensified effect of television viewing on the audience, such that what people see on television is what they have experienced in life.

This concept is central to George Gerbner&#x27;s cultivation theory, which posits that heavy viewers of television, for instance, are more likely to accept the social reality presented by the media as their own. This resonance occurs when individuals find that their own experiences and beliefs align with the content they consume. For example, those who have already been victims of crime perceive the world as far more frightening when they watch more violent television. They may seek greater safety and security measures from the government as a result of this confirmation of their beliefs. While resonance can reinforce existing beliefs and attitudes, it can also foster cultural and social change by influencing viewers&#x27; perceptions of societal norms and values.

==== Cultivation differential ====
In 1968, Gerbner conducted a survey to demonstrate this theory. Following his previous results, he placed television viewers into three categories: light viewers (less than 2 hours a day), medium viewers (2–4 hours a day), and heavy viewers (more than 4 hours a day). Nielsen Media Research went further and defined heavy viewing as watching more than 11 hours a day. He found that heavy viewers held beliefs and opinions similar to those portrayed on television, which demonstrated the compound effect of media influence. Heavy viewers experienced shyness, loneliness, and depression much more than those who watched less often.

In most of the surveys conducted by Gerbner, the results revealed a small but statistically significant relationship between television consumption and fear of becoming the victim of a crime. Those with light viewing habits predicted their weekly odds of being a victim were 1 in 100; those with heavy viewing habits predicted 1 in 10. Actual crime statistics showed the risk to be 1 in 10,000.

Gerbner&#x27;s research also focused on the interpretation by high-use viewers of the prevalence of crime on television versus reality. He argues that, since a high percentage of programs include violent or crime-related content, viewers who spend a lot of time watching are inevitably exposed to high levels of crime and violence.

In 2012, people with heavy viewing habits were found to believe that 5% of society was involved in law enforcement. In contrast, people with light viewing habits estimated a more realistic 1%.

Supporting this finding is a survey done with college students that showed a significant correlation between the attention paid to local crime and one&#x27;s fearfulness. There was also a significant correlation between fear of crime and violence and the number of times the respondents viewed television per week.

Local news has been frequently analyzed for cultivation, as they rely &quot;heavily on sensational coverage of crime and other mayhem with particular emphasis on homicide and violence&quot;, while news agencies boast of their allegiance to report factually. Gerbner found that heavy viewers of news were more likely to overestimate crime rates and risk of personal exposure to crime and underestimate the safety of their neighborhoods. Additionally, several other studies point out the correlation between viewing local news and fear of crime, with Gross and Aiday (2003) finding the relationship between local news exposure and fear of crimes to be independent of local crime rates.

Aside from local news, national news, police shows, and general TV news viewing are also related to a fear of crime. Additionally, non-genre-specific TV viewing has been associated with fear of crime.

Busselle (2003) found that parents who watch more programs portraying crime and violence are more likely to warn their children about crime during their high school years; these warnings, in turn, increased the students&#x27; own crime estimates, suggesting cultivation takes place through both direct and indirect processes.

==== Mean world syndrome ====
From the cultivation differential study, Gerbner then began to work on what would become the mean world syndrome, which is an adoptive attitude that heavy viewers of television, particularly violence-related content, are more likely than light viewers to believe that the world is more frightening and dangerous than it actually is. Gerbner et al. developed an index for mean world syndrome. Also, Those with heavy viewing habits become suspicious of other people&#x27;s motives, and that others cannot be trusted. For example, heavy viewers of violent television are much more likely to be afraid of walking alone at night in fear that they will get robbed, mugged, or even killed. This results in the heavy viewers to try and protect themselves more than others by having watchdogs, buying new locks, investing in a security camera system, and owning guns.

===Television reality===
Cultivation theory research seems to indicate that heavy viewing can result in the viewer adopting a set of beliefs based on content rather than facts. Generally, the beliefs of heavy viewers about the world are consistent with the repetitive and emphasized images and themes presented on television. As such, heavy viewing cultivates a television-shaped world view.

This false reality or &quot;symbolic world&quot; Gerbner discusses can be seen through the media&#x27;s portrayal of different demographic groups. Main characters in television are often depicted as young, outgoing, and energetic. Through the inaccurate portrayal of ethnic groups such as Hispanics, we know that they make up a large portion of the population but are rarely shown as characters. Even Middle-Easterners are widely shown as the villains in television. Therefore, television trains heavy viewers to look at crime such as gun violence, fist fights, and high-speed car chases as normal while actual crime statistics note that violent crime occurs with less than 1% of the US population.

Even across diverse demographics, the amount of viewing can make a difference in terms of viewer conceptions of social reality. The amount of viewing time is the main element in creating television reality for the audience. According to Gerbner&#x27;s research, the more time spent absorbing the world of television, the more likely people are to report perceptions of social reality that can be traced to television&#x27;s most persistent representations of life and society.

Research supports the concept of television reality arising from heavy viewing. According to Wyer and Budesheim, television messages or information (even when they are not necessarily considered truthful) can still be used by viewers to make social judgments. Furthermore, the information shown to be invalid may still inform an audience&#x27;s judgments.

The influence of primetime television shows on public perceptions of science and scientists has been explored by Gerbner (Gerbner, 1987). While Gerbner does not place the entire blame on television shows, he highlights the importance of acknowledging the unquestionable role it plays in shaping people&#x27;s perceptions. Lack of scientific understanding can no longer be associated with &#x27;information-deficit&#x27; because we are living in an &#x27;information-rich world&#x27;. This also brings up the concerns about the implications of possessing too much scientific knowledge as a viewer. While being well informed helps people to make rational scientific choices, excessive scientific knowledge can bring up apprehensions, fears, suspicion, and mistrust. Prime time shows have a wider reachability, visibility, and interact with people from across diverse backgrounds. Television is used in a relatively nonselective way for viewing. These form the strong basis to conclude that scientists and the scientific community can benefit from stronger connections with the producers, directors, and the entertainment industry at large. The market for science shows has an audience group that faces a mixture of &quot;expectations, fears, utilitarian interests, curiosities, ancient prejudices, and superstitions.&quot; Gerbner&#x27;s research used cultivation analysis to understand and examine the response patterns of 1,631 respondents&#x27; group which includes light and heavy viewers. They were presented with five propositions—science makes our way of life change too fast; makes our lives healthier, easier, and more comfortable; breaks down people&#x27;s ideas of right and wrong; is more likely to cause problems than to find solutions; and the growth of science means that a few people can control our lives. The research estimated the percentage of positive responses to science based on two groups divided by sex and education. The study suggested that &quot;the exposure to science through television shows cultivate less favorable orientation towards science, especially in high status groups whose light-viewer members are its greatest supporters, and lower status groups have a generally low opinion of science.&quot; These observations can be understood through the concept of mainstreaming.

=== Institutional process analysis ===
In contrast to the other analyses, there has not been as much research in this third analysis compared to message analysis and cultivation analysis according to Andrew Ledbetter. Institutional process analysis attempts to understand the what happens within a media organization. Institution analysis attempts to understand the policies that media organization hold, the content they decide to broadcast, and even their motives for the content that they broadcast.

Media content may produce more shows, movies, that cater toward different audiences, but Michael Morgan, James Shanahan and Nancy Signorielli argue that a disproportionately small amount of individuals control the media content compared to the audience that views the content. Media Organization&#x27;s primary concern is of profit rather than ethics and catering to diverse audiences and perspectives. As much as Gerbner was concerned with Institutional Process Analysis, no clear method was created to study media organizations practices and their motives behind the content.

== Application of theory ==

===Gender and sexuality===

====LGBTQIA+====
Sara Baker Netzley (2010) conducted research similar to Gerbner&#x27;s into the way that gay people were depicted on television. This study found that there was an extremely high level of sexual activity in comparison to the number of gay characters that appeared on television. This has led those who are heavy television consumers to believe that the gay community is extremely sexual. Much like the idea of a mean and scary world, it gives people an exaggerated sense of a sexualized gay community.

A study conducted by Jerel Calzo and Monique Ward (2009) begins by analyzing recent research conducted into the portrayal of gay and lesbian characters on television. While the representation of gay and lesbian characters has continued to grow, the study found that most television shows frame gay and lesbian characters in a manner that reinforces LGBT stereotypes. Diving into the discussion, Calzo and Ward describe even shows such as &quot;Ellen&quot; and &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; as having storyline content that reinforces &quot;stereotypes by portraying [...] characters as lacking stable relationships, as being preoccupied with their sexuality (or not sexual at all), and by perpetuating the perception of gay and lesbian people as laughable, one-dimensional figures.&quot; Their findings confirmed that media genres played an important role in forming attitudes regarding homosexuality. They were surprised by the finding that prior primetime shows, which are no longer on air, reinforced greater acceptance within the LGBTQ realm. They then suggested that, because genre played a large role in the perceptions that viewers formed while watching certain television shows, research should focus on &quot;more genre-driven effects analyses.&quot;

====Men and women====
In their 2022 study, Scharrer and Warren examined the endorsement of traditionally masculine values in regard to gender norms among combined viewers of streaming services such as Netflix, video games, and YouTube. Traditional masculine traits in this study included &quot;emotional detachment, dominance, toughness, and/or avoidance of femininity among boys and girls in the sample&quot; (Scharrer &amp; Warren, 2022). Results showed that participants in the heavy viewer category indicated higher scores of endorsement of traditionally masculine traits for men compared to light viewers.

Beverly Roskos-Ewoldsen, John Davies, and David Roskos-Ewoldsen (2004) posit that perceptions of women are integrated in a rather stereotypical fashion, compared to portrayals of men, on television. They state that, &quot;men are characters in TV shows at about a 2 to 1 ratio to women.&quot; Viewers who consume more television usually also have more traditional views of women. Research has also shown that women are more likely to be portrayed as victims on television than men.

Alexander Sink and Dana Mastro (2017) studied women and gender depictions on American prime-time television. Although women are often perceived to be better represented on television in recent years, these researchers claim that this is not necessarily the case. They claim women are proportionally underrepresented on prime time television, making up 39% of characters even though women make up 50.9% of the population in the US. Men were also portrayed as more dominant than women, and although men were more often objectified, women were consistently portrayed as hyper-feminized and hyper-sexualized. Fewer older women appeared during prime time, compared to men, and were often shown to be less competent than older male characters.

====Sexual attitudes====
Cultivation theory has been utilized when conducting research on sexual attitudes regarding women. Sex-role stereotypes can be traced to the independent contribution of TV viewing, just as sex, age, class, and education contribute. Rita Seabrook found that there was a positive relationship of viewing reality TV, pornography, and sports programming and an acceptance of objectifying women and a higher tolerance for sexual aggression.

A study by Bradley J. Bond and Kristin L. Drogos (2014) examined the relationship between exposure to the television program &quot;Jersey Shore&quot; and sexual attitudes and behavior in college-aged adults. They found a positive relationship between time spent watching &quot;Jersey Shore&quot; and increased sexual permissiveness. This effect was found to be stronger in the younger participants than in older ones and held true even when the researchers controlled for other influences on participants&#x27; sexual attitudes, such as religious beliefs and parents&#x27; attitudes. This higher level of sexually permissive attitudes and behavior was not a result of higher overall exposure to television, but specifically to greater exposure to &quot;Jersey Shore&quot;, a highly sexualized program.

=== Race and ethnicity ===
A substantial part of stereotyping and perception of races can be drawn back to the media. The representation and the depiction of races and ethnicities in media can have an effect on how we stereotype them. Both representation and lack of representation can have an effect on people of differing races and social groups. Lack of representation in media can lead people, especially children, to feel a lack of self worth or less valued than another race or social group. This can be seen when looking into how media, specifically television and film, portray different races and ethnicities.

Meghan S. Sanders and Srividya Ramasubramanian (2012) studied perceptions that African American media consumers hold about fictional characters portrayed in film and television. They found that—while study participants tended to view all African American characters positively—social class, rather than race or ethnicity, mattered more in perceptions about the warmth and competence of a character. Their study suggests that the ethnicity of media consumers needs to be taken into account in cultivation studies, because media consumers with different backgrounds likely perceive media portrayals, and their faithfulness to reality differently. The depiction of these ethnic groups in media can have an effect on how they are perceived in reality and even how they perceive each other.

A study by Elizabeth Behm-Morawitz and David Ta (2014) examined the cultivation effects of video games on White students&#x27; perceptions of Black and Asian individuals. While no significant effects were found for perceptions of Asian individuals, researchers found that those who spent a greater amount of time playing video games, no matter what genre, held a less positive view of Black people. They also found that real-life interaction with Black individuals did not change this effect. Behm-Morawitz and Ta suggest that the stable, negative racial and ethnic stereotypes portrayed in video game narratives of any genre impact real-world beliefs, in spite of more varied real-life interactions with racial and ethnic minorities.

Chrysalis Wright and Michelle Craske (2015) conducted a study using the cultivation framework to examine the relationship between music lyrics and videos that contained sexual content and the sexual behaviors of African American, Hispanic and Caucasian young adults. In previous studies, it was hypothesized that the heavy listening habits of youth to sexually explicit content can alter the listener&#x27;s perception of reality and normalize risky sexual behaviors. However, Wright and Caste are the first study to assess the cultivation framework&#x27;s ability to explain the possible relationship. Their findings concluded that there were minimal effects on those from Caucasian or Hispanic backgrounds with one or two normalized sexual behaviors, such as age of first relationship and sexual encounter. In comparison, researchers found that there were several normalized sexual behaviors found within participants from an African American background, such as earlier age of first date and sexual encounter, higher amount of casual sexual encounters and lower percentage of condom usage.

It is speculated that the effects of cultivation are more prominent within the African American community as opposed to other ethnic groups as African Americans might view music as an accurate representation of their culture. Chen (2006) found that rap music was the most popular music genre listened to by African Americans, and more explicit sexual references have been associated with rap in comparison to other genres with &quot;78% of rap, 53% of pop, 37% of rock, and 36% of country music videos containing some form of sexual reference.&quot; Furthermore, previous research displayed that non-Caucasian artists make more allusions to sexual content, referencing sexual acts 21% of the time as compared to 7.5% of the time by Caucasian artists. These cultivation effects of musicians creating a false reality in regards to sexual behaviors and experiences through their lyrics and videos may make African American listeners more vulnerable to &quot;adopt thinking processes and behave similar to the content contained in the music they are exposed to.&quot;

===Politics and policy preferences===
Two of George Gerbner&#x27;s colleagues, Michael Morgan and James Shanahan, have found that those with heavy viewing habits may label themselves as moderate, however their positions on various social issues leaned conservative. Furthermore, heavy viewers were more likely to hold authoritarian beliefs. Morgan and Shanahan provide this study in context of the 2016 Presidential election.

Diana Mutz and Lilach Nir (2010) conducted a study of how fictional television narratives can influence viewers&#x27; policy preferences and positive or negative attitudes regarding the justice system in the real world. They found that positive portrayals of the criminal justice system were associated with viewers&#x27; more positive view of the system in real life, whereas negative television portrayals were associated with viewers&#x27; feeling that the criminal justice system often works unfairly. Furthermore, researchers found that these attitudes did influence viewers&#x27; policy preferences concerning the criminal justice system in real life.

A study by Anita Atwell Seate and Dana Mastro (2016) studied news coverage of immigration and its relationship to viewers&#x27; immigration policy preferences and negative attitudes regarding immigrants. They found that exposure to negative messages about immigrants in the news generated anxious feelings towards the outgroup (i.e., immigrants), particularly when the news program showed a member of the outgroup. This exposure did not necessarily immediately influence immigration policy preferences, but long-term exposure to messages of this kind can affect such preferences.

Katerina-Eva Matsa (2010) explored cultivation effects through her thesis on television&#x27;s impact on political engagement in Greece. She did so by describing the role of satirical television within the cultural realm in Greece and how this form of television created ingrained perceptions that Greek political institutions are corrupt, thus negatively influencing the Greek public&#x27;s overall opinion of politics in their country.

=== Altruistic behavior ===

Zakir Shah, Jianxun Chu, Usman Ghani, Sara Qaisar, and Zameer Hassan (2020) conducted the first study from the perspective of cultivation theory to determine the mediating role of fear of victimization, gained from exposure to disaster-related media, on altruistic behavior. Findings show that exposure to disaster-related news and individuals’ perceptions taken from the media contributed to fear of victimization. Moreover, fear of victimization from disaster significantly influences the altruistic behavior of people.

A research study that examines television viewing, narrative engagement, and three Idealistic moral expectations: just world beliefs, altruism of doctors, tolerance of others. They found that television viewing, narrative engagement, and moral expectations were all dependent on each other.

=== New media ===
Technology has evolved since George Gerbner developed this theory. Society has more media to consume than just prime-time television. Andrew Ledbetter identified three key differences in television in the age of new media: recordable, mobile, and many choices.  Recordable means people have the ability to watch programs at anytime as opposed to the mid-century when television had a time-specific showing of any program. Mobile means people have the ability to watch video content wherever they go through smartphones. And third, many choices entails the multitude of streaming platforms, and even the many choices within each streaming platform.

Cultivation theory has been applied to the study of new media. Scholars Morgan, Shanahan &amp; Signorielli noted that media technology has not been static, and may continue to evolve. Therefore, older methods of cultivation analysis may have to move from counting hours of television viewed, and take a big data approach. These authors argue that, although many were skeptical that cultivation theory would be applicable with the increasing importance of new media, these new media still use narrative; and, since those narratives affect us, cultivation theory is still relevant.

Croucher (2011) applied cultivation theory to his theory of social media and its effects on immigrant cultural adaptation. He theorizes that immigrants who use the dominant social media while they are still in the process of adapting to their new culture will develop perceptions about their host society from that media. He believes that this cultivation effect will also impact the way immigrants interact offline with natives of the host country. In a similar vein, the cultivation framework has been applied to the study of body image effects on social media platforms, with research indicating that browsing through certain types of content relates to distorted views on the physical appearances of strangers.

==== Minors and the Internet ====
Since the 1960s, communication scholars have examined television&#x27;s contributions to viewers&#x27; perceptions of a wide variety of issues. However, little effort has been made to investigate the influence of television on perceptions of social reality among adolescents. Cultivation theory, which mainly studies the long-term impact of television on the audience, in a specific group of people, the longer the group watches TV, the closer the audience&#x27;s perception of reality is to the content of the TV. Cultivation theory is one of the most common theories in today&#x27;s lives, especially for teens and children, because adults can control and discern content on TV shows and social media, but minors cannot tell the difference between right and wrong all the time, “for example, the fact that media often broadcast programs, news or movies with violent content creates a social environment in which violence is taught and consumed.” (Busair Ahmad, 2015). There is hope that television and film programs will be reformed to reduce the impact on children, the government and people from all walks of life are also working hard to formulate policies to protect young people. “We provide recommendations for clinicians, policymakers, and educators in partnering with caregivers and youth to support electronic media use that promotes positive outcomes in these areas.” (Gaidhane, 2018).

== Social Media ==
Originally, cultivation theory focused on the interactions individuals have with the media, such as watching the news on television. For example, a study focusing on television consumption among adolescents found that those who watched more TV had become more desensitized to the dangers of alcohol. Traditionally cultivation has studied “changes in the mass production and rapid distribution of messages across previous barriers of time, space, and social grouping,” with its main focus pertaining to television. Cultivation is starting to look at social media as a tool that shapes perceptions. 

Cultivation theory has continued to evolve through the rise of the internet and social media. In 2019, focusing on the application of cultivation through the use of Instagram, Stein, Krause, and Ohler, found female participants depicted more of a negative self-body image compared to males when scrolling on their homepage. This experiment also found that women perceive other women as having better self-esteem regarding body image. Another study found that social media influenced college students&#x27; perceptions of other students&#x27; self-efficacy. This study looked at Facebook and Twitter. Researchers discovered that Twitter had more of a positive direct effect on students when compared to Facebook, which cultivated a negative direct effect. One study suggested that cultivation through mass media, such as television, has a greater effect compared to social media. In 2024, a study focusing on social media&#x27;s impact on optimism and pessimism in regards to individuals&#x27; outlook on the world found that social media does shape these perspectives. There was a positive correlation between high social media usage and the development of a more negative mindset about the world, which is an example of Mean World Syndrome. Cultivation theory suggests that the use of social media also impacts how individuals learn about their own culture as well as the cultures of those around them. This can also cultivate an implicit bias about groups that are different from oneself. These studies all adhere to the main idea of cultivation, that “those who spend more time watching television [and being on social media] are more likely to perceive the real world in ways that reflect the most common and recurrent messages of the world of fictional television.&quot;

== Books ==
Authors and researchers have developed multiple books over the years based on cultivation theory. One of the earliest books written based on cultivation theory was in 1995, where James Shanahan and Michael Morgan came together to write the book &quot;Television and its Viewers&quot; Then, one of the latest books based on the topic was written by Andy Ruddock in 2020, called &quot;&quot;Digital Media Influence: A Cultivation Approach&quot;.&quot;

== Criticism ==
Although there is a significant correlation between TV viewing and perception of reality, cultivation effects have a small influence on an individual&#x27;s perception of the world. Michael Morgan and James Shanahan conducted a meta-analysis in 1997 that revealed that increased television viewing did have a significant relationship between amount of television viewed and perception of reality. However, the change in perception was small. Hirsch (1980) argues that there will be very little effect that can be attributed to television if other variables are controlled simultaneously. In Hirsch&#x27;s review, he found that even people who did not watch television perceived the world as violent and dangerous.

Costanze Rossman argues that there is little evidence that TV viewing causes fear of violence. The variables may even be reversed in the relationship where fear of violence increases TV viewing. Other variables may influence this relationship, like living in an area with a high-crime rate.

Elihu Katz, the founder of uses and gratifications theory, listed cultivation theory in his article, &quot;Six Concepts in Search of Retirement&quot;. One of the reasons for retiring this theory is because of technology changes that have happened from when the theory was founded. George Gerbner&#x27;s theory was founded in 1973, which was an era where prime time television was the dominant medium. Given that this theory developed before the age of the internet and social media, Morgan, Shanahan and Signorelli offer a suggestion about where the theory could go next in the age of new media. In the age of new media is recordable, mobile and has many choices, the authors wonder if the content and messages have become more diverse, therefore having an influence on cultivation.

Jennings Bryant points out that cultivation research focuses more on the effects rather than who or what is being influenced, being more to do with the &quot;whys and hows&quot;, as opposed to gathering normative data as to the &quot;whats, whos, and wheres&quot;. Daniel Chandler argues that while television does have some effect on how we perceive the world around us, Gerbner&#x27;s study does not consider the lived experiences of those who do inhabit high crime areas. Horace Newcomb argues that violence is not presented as uniformly on television as the theory assumes; therefore, television cannot be responsible for cultivating the same sense of reality for all viewers.

<text>Anything Else is a 2003 American romantic comedy film written and directed by Woody Allen, produced by Letty Aronson, and starring Allen, Jason Biggs, Stockard Channing, Danny DeVito, Jimmy Fallon, and Christina Ricci. The film premiered as the opening night selection of the 60th Venice International Film Festival. It was released theatrically in the United States on September 19, 2003, to mixed reviews.

==Plot==
Jerry Falk, an aspiring writer living in New York City, has a girlfriend, Brooke. He falls in love with Amanda and has an affair with her. Brooke learns of Jerry&#x27;s infidelity and leaves him, while Amanda leaves her own boyfriend for Jerry. Jerry turns to aging, struggling artist David Dobel, who acts as his mentor, which includes trying to help sort out Jerry&#x27;s romantic life. Dobel says that when he told a cab driver of all his anxieties and phobias in life, the cab driver told him, &quot;It&#x27;s like anything else&quot;.

Dobel tries to convince Jerry that his manager is only holding him back and his relationship with Amanda is the most destructive force in his life. Amanda continuously cheats on Jerry. Amanda leaves and then comes back. Jerry&#x27;s neuroses start to worsen. Eventually, Jerry leaves town as Dobel gets him a job writing for television in California. Amanda has an affair with the doctor who was treating her and runs off with him. He sees them together laughing as she once did with him as the cab is taking him towards the airport. Jerry talks to the cabbie of love and relationships. The cabbie simply replies, &quot;It&#x27;s like anything else&quot;.

==Cast==
==Reception==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 40% based on reviews from 136 critics, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus states, &quot;Too many elements from better Woody Allen films are being recycled here.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 43 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade C− on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four, and wrote: &quot;At a time when so many American movies keep dialogue at a minimum so they can play better overseas, what a delight to listen to smart people whose conversation is like a kind of comic music.&quot;
James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Anything Else&quot; may not be the second coming of &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, but it has more wit and substance than almost every post-college romance that sees the inside of a projection booth&quot;.
David Stratton of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;The younger casting brings a freshness to the material and, with Allen as the weird mentor, there are plenty of laughs, even if the pacing&#x27;s slow and the running time over-extended.&quot;

Mike Clark of &quot;USA Today&quot; was critical of the characterizations, the music, the length (&quot;brutally overlong&quot;), but praised the actors for their performances: &quot;It&#x27;s asking a lot of audiences to spend nearly two hours with characters as screen-unfriendly as the ones played by Biggs and Ricci, though both actors (and especially Ricci) do what they&#x27;re asked to do.&quot; Clark also says the film &quot;sounds as if it ought to be funny, but like so much else here, intent and execution keep missing each other.&quot; and complains that the misery of the story is not tempered by sufficient laughs.

In August 2009, it was cited by Quentin Tarantino as one of his favorite 20 films since 1992, when his career as a filmmaker began.

Leonard Maltin, in his &quot;TV, Movie, &amp; Video Guide&quot;, gave the film a &quot;BOMB&quot; rating (the only Allen-directed film ever to receive this citation), and called it &quot;a rare misfire for Woody, but still a big one&quot;.
In 2016, film critics Robbie Collin and Tim Robey of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; ranked &quot;Anything Else&quot; as one of the worst movies by Woody Allen.

<text>Warren Weaver (July 17, 1894 – November 24, 1978) was an American scientist, mathematician, and science administrator. He is widely recognized as one of the pioneers of machine translation and as an important figure in creating support for science in the United States.

== Career ==

Weaver received three degrees from the University of Wisconsin–Madison: a Bachelor of Science in 1916, a civil engineering degree in 1917, and a Ph.D. in 1921. He became an assistant professor of mathematics at Throop College (now California Institute of Technology). He served as a second lieutenant in the Air Service during World War I. After the war, he returned to teach mathematics at Wisconsin (1920–32).

Weaver was also given an honorary LLD degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a Doctor of Science degree from the University of São Paulo.

Weaver was director of the Division of Natural Sciences at the Rockefeller Foundation (1932–55), and was science consultant (1947–51), trustee (1954), and vice president (from 1958) at the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research. His chief researches were in the problems of communication in science and in the mathematical theory of probability and statistics.

At the Rockefeller Foundation, he was responsible for approving grants for major projects in molecular engineering and genetics, in agriculture (particularly for developing new strains of wheat and rice), and in medical research.

During World War II, he was seconded from the foundation to head the Applied Mathematics Panel at the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development, directing the work of mathematicians in operations research with the assistance of Mina Rees. He was familiar with the development of electronic calculating machines and the successful application of mathematical and statistical techniques in cryptography.

He has served as a member of the Department of War&#x27;s Research Advisory Panel and the Naval Research Advisory Committee.

Weaver was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1944.

He was president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1954 and chairman of the board in 1955, a member or chairman of numerous boards and committees, and the primary author of the Arden House Statement, a 1951 declaration of principle and guide to setting the association&#x27;s goals, plans, and procedures. He also served as vice-president of the board of trustees of the Academy of Religion and Mental Health and chairman of the board of the Salk Institute of Biological Studies. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958. The National Academy of Sciences chose him to be a member in 1969.

When Claude Shannon&#x27;s 1948 articles on communication theory were republished in 1949 as The Mathematical Theory of Communication, the book also republished a much shorter article authored by Weaver, which discusses the implications of Shannon&#x27;s more technical work for a general audience.

With Max Mason, he co-authored the book &quot;The Electromagnetic Field&quot;, first published in 1929 and re-issued in 1959. He also authored the books &quot;Lady Luck: The Theory of Probability&quot;, first published in 1963 and republished in 1982, &quot;Elementary Mathematical Analysis&quot;, and an autobiography called &quot;Scene of Change&quot;.

The home of the Courant Institute at New York University is Warren Weaver Hall.

== The &quot;Translation&quot; memorandum ==
Weaver had first mentioned the possibility of using digital computers to translate documents between natural human languages in March 1947 in a letter to the cyberneticist Norbert Wiener. In the following two years, he had been urged by his colleagues at the Rockefeller Foundation to elaborate on his ideas. The result was a memorandum, entitled simply &quot;Translation&quot;, which he wrote in July 1949 at Carlsbad, New Mexico.

Said to be probably the single most influential publication in the early days of machine translation, it formulated goals and methods before most people had any idea of what computers might be capable of, and was the direct stimulus for the beginnings of research first in the United States and then later, indirectly, throughout the world. The impact of Weaver&#x27;s memorandum is attributable not only to his widely recognized expertise in mathematics and computing, but also, and perhaps even more, to the influence he enjoyed with major policy-makers in U.S. government agencies.

Weaver&#x27;s memorandum was designed to suggest more fruitful methods than any simplistic word-for-word approach, which had grave limitations. He put forward four proposals. The first was that the problem of multiple meanings might be tackled by the examination of immediate context. For example, the English word &quot;fast&quot; has at least two meanings which we can paraphrase as &quot;rapid&quot; or &quot;motionless&quot;. If we wish to translate an English text, it is likely that these two senses of &quot;fast&quot; correspond to different words in the target language, and in order to translate the word correctly one needs to know which sense is intended. Weaver proposed that this problem could be solved by looking at the words that occur in the vicinity of the word to be translated, and he conjectured that the number of context words that would be required is fairly small.

The second proposal in the memorandum was inspired by work on an early type of neural networks by McCulloch and Pitts. Weaver interpreted these results as meaning that given a set of premises, any logical conclusion could be deduced automatically by computer. To the extent that human language has a logical basis, Weaver hypothesized that translation could be addressed as a problem of formal logic, deducing &quot;conclusions&quot; in the target language from &quot;premises&quot; in the source language.

The third proposal was that cryptographic methods were possibly applicable to translation. If we want to translate, say, a Russian text into English, we can take the Russian original as an encrypted version of the English plaintext. Weaver was especially impressed with the potential of Shannon&#x27;s classified work on cryptography and Information theory from World War II.

Finally, the fourth proposal was that there may also be linguistic universals underlying all human languages which could be exploited to make the problem of translation more straightforward. Weaver argued for this position using a metaphor: &quot;Think, by analogy, of individuals living in a series of tall closed towers, all erected over a common foundation. When they try to communicate with one another, they shout back and forth, each from his own closed tower. It is difficult to make the sound penetrate even the nearest towers, and communication proceeds very poorly indeed. But, when an individual goes down his tower, he finds himself in a great open basement, common to all the towers. Here he establishes easy and useful communication with the persons who have also descended from their towers&quot;. He was inspired by Erwin Reifler, who in 1948 presented a paper entitled &quot;the Chinese Language in the Light of Comparative Semantics&quot; at the American Philosophical Society annual conference. The abstract of the paper was published by &quot;Science&quot; in the same year, which was referred to in the memorandum.

Weaver&#x27;s memorandum triggered immediate action from the part of other MT specialists. One of the first people on the scene was Erwin Reifler, mentioned in the memorandum itself. In a study published in January 1950, he put forward the idea of pre- and post-editing with the assumption that fully automated translation can only be done on the basis of word-for-word substitutions, which would cause inadequacies and errors in the generated translation. His suggestion for eliminating the problem was implementing a human pre-editor with the knowledge of the output language, who would add additional symbols for grammatical, lexical and logical correctness. The post editor, in turn, would have the task of rendering the text generated by MT reasonable and logical; ideally, he would have the knowledge of the source language.

== Advocate for science ==

Weaver understood how greatly the tools and techniques of physics and chemistry could advance knowledge of biological processes, and used his position in the Rockefeller Foundation to identify, support, and encourage the young scientists who years later earned Nobel Prizes and other honours for their contributions to genetics or molecular biology.

== Awards ==

Weaver was awarded the Public Welfare Medal by the National Academy of Sciences in 1957. In 1965 he was awarded the first Arches of Science Medal for outstanding contributions to the public understanding of the meaning of science to contemporary men and women, and UNESCO&#x27;s Kalinga Prize for distinguished contributions to the popular understanding of science.

He also received the Medal for Merit, a position as an officer in the Legion of Honour, and the King&#x27;s Medal for Service in the Cause of Freedom.

== Other activities ==

Weaver was fascinated by Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. In 1964, having built up a collection of 160 versions in 42 languages, Weaver wrote a book about the translation history of Alice, called &quot;Alice in Many Tongues: The Translations of Alice in Wonderland&quot;. Among other features, it provides excerpts from the business correspondence of the author, Lewis Carroll (the Reverend Charles Dodgson), dealing with publishing royalties and permissions as Alice&#x27;s fame snowballed worldwide. Ever the scientist, even in the area of literature, Weaver devised a design for evaluating the quality of the various translations, focusing on the nonsense, puns and logical jokes in the Mad Tea-Party scene. His range of contacts provided an impressive if eccentric list of collaborators in the evaluation exercise, including anthropologist Margaret Mead (for the South Pacific Pidgin translation), longtime Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek, and Nobel laureate biochemist Hugo Theorell (Swedish). The book &quot;Alice in a World of Wonderlands&quot; (2015) continues and updates Weaver&#x27;s endeavour, analyzing &quot;Alice&quot; translations in 174 languages in a similar vein.

<doc id="473291" wikidata="Q242945" url="?curid=473291" title="Mary Kay Bergman">
<text>Mary Kay Bergman (June 5, 1961 – November 11, 1999), also briefly credited as Shannen Cassidy, was an American voice actress and voice-over teacher. She was the official voice of the Disney character Snow White from 1989 to 1999 and the lead female voice actress on &quot;South Park&quot; from the show&#x27;s debut in 1997 until her death. She was also the voice actress of Claudette and Laurette in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, Dr. Blight in &quot;Captain Planet and the Planeteers&quot; (replacing Meg Ryan), Katie in &quot;Family Dog&quot;, and Daphne Blake from 1997 to 1999. Throughout her career, Bergman performed voice work for every aspect in media, including over 400 television commercials.

Bergman was born in Los Angeles, California. Bergman had an interest in animation and impersonation early in her life. After acting in her first professional role in the television film &quot;Return Engagement&quot;, she studied theater arts at UCLA for three years. Struggling to find a job suited for her, she was trained under her voice-acting teacher Kat Lehman and started performing radio voiceovers. She was chosen as the replacement of Snow White after a long search of talent agencies and voiceover classes. She joined The Groundlings to sharpen her voice acting skills, which contributed to her audition of &quot;Family Dog.&quot; In 1994, she started teaching voice acting classes. Bergman was cast as nearly every female character in &quot;South Park&quot; after she gave Trey Parker and Matt Stone ideas they originally did not have.

Bergman suffered generalized anxiety disorder in her private life. Her condition, which led to physical symptoms and severe stress, was kept private. On November 11, 1999, she wrote two suicide notes and shot herself in the head. Shortly after Bergman&#x27;s death, her husband Dino Andrade established the Mary Kay Bergman Memorial Fund.

== Life and career ==

=== 1961–1978: Early life ===
Bergman was born on June 5, 1961, in Los Angeles, California. An only child, her mother, Patricia McGowen, was an animation cel painter for Max Fleischer on &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons in New York City. Her parents performed as a singing duo at lounges and clubs in Reno and Las Vegas, Nevada, and Los Angeles. They settled in Los Angeles after her mother became pregnant. Bergman was piqued by her mother&#x27;s interest in animation, which led to a shared interest by watching Saturday-morning cartoons together.

At an early age, Bergman wanted to be a film star. Bergman&#x27;s early passion for impersonating was influenced by &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, a film she watched in theaters at the age of six or seven. She grew up around the corner from the home of Adriana Caselotti, the original voice of Snow White, whom she idolized. Bergman attended Joseph Le Conte Middle School and Hollywood High School.

=== 1978–1986: Career beginnings ===
At age 16, Bergman received her first professional acting job in the television film &quot;Return Engagement&quot;, which starred Elizabeth Taylor. However, Bergman&#x27;s scene at the end of the film was cut out, making her disappointed. Shortly, Bergman joined the Screen Actors Guild. Upon graduating from Hollywood High School in June 1978 with top academic honors, Bergman enrolled at UCLA and studied theater arts from 1978 until 1981. According to her husband Dino Andrade, she attended the university because she was a fan of Carol Burnett and wanted to attend the same university as Burnett did. She was a classmate and friend of future &quot;The Simpsons&quot; voice actress Nancy Cartwright. After three years in the university, Bergman received a role in a play outside of school and dropped out to start her professional life.

Bergman joined a small agency in the valley of Los Angeles, which started six months before she joined. She auditioned for an exercise program that was scheduled to appear on cable programming. A week after Bergman received the role, the agency was closed, and reopened as a candy store. She described the experience as &quot;the worst agent story in the business.&quot; Bergman&#x27;s next role was as a receptionist for the Boy Scouts of America. She enjoyed the job and was pleased to work with the people of the organization. She also received compliments about her speaking voice, which added to her frustration. Bergman also worked as a receptionist for an insurance company and from there she moved up the ranks to become an assistant underwriter, which she found &quot;extremely boring.&quot; To break the monotony, Bergman thought about becoming a disc jockey but could not find information about where to take classes.

While working as a receptionist, Bergman received an invitation to a party from one of her co-workers at the insurance company. When Bergman attended the party, she danced and sang with a karaoke machine. Her impersonation of Ethel Merman caught the attention of voice-over teacher Kat Lehman. Bergman studied voice acting and took all Lehman&#x27;s classes. After her final class, Bergman recorded a demo tape and was delivered to Bergman&#x27;s first voice-acting agency, Abrams, Rubaloff, and Lawrence. Bergman soon quit her job as a receptionist after realizing that &quot;squeezing auditions into her regular work schedule was not working.&quot; Her first voice role was a frightened woman in a radio commercial for a small home security company on a local station in 1986.

=== 1986–1993: Snow White and &quot;Family Dog&quot; ===
While she performed radio voiceovers, she found a part-time job at a department store to supplement her income. Bergman went with her personal agent Libby Westby after Westby switched agencies to Sutton, Barth, and Vennari. At around the same time, Disney was looking for a replacement for Adriana Caselotti, the original voice of Snow White, who was not always available to work. Bergman was chosen by former Disney executive Les Perkins after a &quot;long and tedious search&quot; of talent agencies and voiceover classes throughout Los Angeles. Upon learning that she would be the official replacement of Snow White, Bergman expressed trepidation, describing the voice as &quot;very difficult&quot;. Her first voiceover appearance as Snow White was for a book on tape, but she needed a day off for the recording. After her boss at a department store refused, she had a choice to keep the job at a department store or do voiceover work as Snow White. She chose the latter, and she agreed to lend her voice only when Caselotti was unavailable. At its peak of popularity, Bergman was chosen to voice Dr. Blight in &quot;Captain Planet and the Planeteers&quot; by the producers of the show after Meg Ryan opted out. She also voiced two of the Bimbettes, Claudette and Laurette, in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. She began doing matches for other actors such as Jodie Foster, Gillian Anderson, Helen Hunt, Julia Roberts, Jennifer Tilly, Emma Thompson, and Alfre Woodard.

To further improve her acting skills, Bergman joined The Groundlings, which helped her use her skills while auditioning for &quot;Family Dog&quot;. During audition, Bergman would be asked on &quot;how [she act] to be sexy&quot;. Bergman improvised &quot;her best sexy dog&quot; while feeling &quot;like an idiot&quot;, worrying that she did &quot;everything wrong&quot; to the casting director. Three weeks after the audition, Bergman received a call notifying her that she not only received the role of Katie, but her tape was chosen out of hundreds that were submitted by Steven Spielberg. The show became one of Bergman&#x27;s favorite projects. Bergman stated that she would do five or six voices in each episode, which she enjoyed. Bergman also met Frank Welker, one of her mentors, which was considered a positive experience for her. &quot;Family Dog&quot; was scheduled to debut on March 20, 1991, but the show was ultimately pushed back until 1993 for the animation to be completed. The show&#x27;s first episode debuted on June 23, 1993, on CBS.

=== 1993–1999: Academy Awards dubbing and &quot;South Park&quot; ===
When Disney was working on a restored version of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; on LaserDisc, Caselotti was brought back in to record a rediscovered scene that was missing its audio track. After the studio executives listened to her work, they decided to bring in Bergman to record the voice instead. Bergman also voiced Snow White for the 65th Academy Awards instead of Caselotti. Caselotti was unaware her voice had been replaced until the 65th Academy Awards when Snow White presented the award for Best Animated Short Film. In 1995, Bergman expressed dismay on voicing her for the ceremony, stating that it was &quot;one of the most uncomfortable times in [her] entire career.&quot; She also felt disappointed for her, expressing that a responsibility should be made to keep the character as an important part of Caselotti&#x27;s career. Disney received hundreds of complaints after the ceremony, noting the changes to the Snow White character that Jeffrey Katzenberg had made, including a more modernized look to match her updated voice. Katzenberg issued written apologies, and Bergman did not publicly admit to voicing Snow White while Caselotti was still alive.
In 1994, Bergman started teaching the technique of doing voice-overs for animation at the Kalmenson &amp; Kalmenson Studios in Burbank.
Trey Parker and Matt Stone were looking for a different voice actress for the female characters in &quot;South Park&quot;, as they were unhappy with Karri Turner&#x27;s performance in the series&#x27; unaired pilot. Bergman attended a recast in Los Angeles and gave them several ideas they originally did not have. The ideas she gave included portraying Liane Cartman as a &quot;1950s sitcom-style mother&quot;, interjecting Sheila Broflovski&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;What, what, what!&quot; when she gets flustered, and adding a lisp to Stan Marsh&#x27;s sister, Shelley. Parker and Stone cast her as nearly every female character in the series. Bergman&#x27;s characters included Liane Cartman, Sheila Broflovski, Shelly Marsh, Sharon Marsh, Carol McCormick, and Wendy Testaburger. In her interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 1999, Bergman credited &quot;South Park&quot; for distancing her out of her reputation known for voicing characters in children&#x27;s animation.

Although the show appealed to Bergman&#x27;s &quot;dark sense of humor&quot;, she was credited as Shannen Cassidy (taken from Shannen Doherty and David Cassidy) in the first two seasons due to the concerns that her voice role as Snow White would be taken out if the Walt Disney Company knew that she was in &quot;South Park&quot;. Additionally, Bergman&#x27;s husband, Dino Andrade, noted that nobody believed that &quot;South Park&quot; was going to last. After &quot;South Park&quot; became a success, however, Shannen Cassidy began to receive copious amounts of fan mail and Bergman decided to abandon the alias. In addition, Bergman performed sixteen voices for the film &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot;. Bergman overdubbed nine separate voices for the film&#x27;s song &quot;Blame Canada&quot;. Bergman was nominated for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Voice Acting in an Animated Feature Production for her performance as Sheila Broflovski at the 27th Annie Awards.

==Personal life==
Bergman married voice actor Dino Andrade on April 7, 1990. They remained married for the rest of Bergman&#x27;s life. At the height of her popularity, Bergman started to physically suffer from insomnia, myalgia, and nausea. She was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder by her physician, which was determined to be caused by severe stress. This was hidden as a secret to everyone, including her husband, family, and friends. She also privately admitted to her husband that she was afraid of losing her abilities and that her career would end because of her condition.

==Death==
On the morning of November 11, 1999, Bergman contributed to a radio program celebrating Disneyland&#x27;s 45th anniversary, performing the voice of Snow White for a radio commercial. Later, in the evening, Andrade returned to her home in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Venice to find that Bergman had fatally shot herself in the head, with two suicide notes, the first one for Andrade and the second one for John Bell, stating that she could not &quot;handle [her] fear anymore.&quot; Attorney Robert Harrison originally stated that she had shown no signs of depression. The Los Angeles County Coroner&#x27;s Office reported that the cause of death was ruled a self-inflicted shotgun wound.

Bergman is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills. Andrade revealed that she was buried there since one of her biggest thrills was attending private screenings of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; in the Walt Disney Company&#x27;s original screening room, which is located near her grave.

=== Public reaction ===
Following her death, news of her death was published on several websites, including &quot;South Park&quot;&#x27;s website. A lot of established websites that included the news of her death, including her memorial page and a message board of Bergman, also received popularity. News of her death triggered an outpouring of grief from her fans and friends. &quot;South Park&quot; creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone were initially &quot;too distraught&quot; to issue a statement about her death. On March 2, 2000, during an interview with Parker and Stone at the Paley Center for Media, they issued a statement about Bergman, stating they realized that &quot;one person wasn&#x27;t going to do it&quot; because of her vocal capabilities, and that they were in a process of finding &quot;a lot of talented voice people&quot;.

=== Memorial ===
On November 15, Sutton, Barth, and Vennari ran a full memorial to her on the &quot;Variety&quot; magazine. To honor Bergman and encourage others to seek help, Dino Andrade established the Mary Kay Bergman Memorial Fund at the Suicide Prevention Center of Didi Hirsch Community Mental Health Center, which raised thousands of dollars toward the cause. Her official website, mkbmemorial.com, was converted to support a mental health program for those diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder.

== Voice acting style ==
Bergman was known for her distinctive voice acting on her &quot;sweet, cute little characters.&quot; Her voice-acting skills also increased over time, which included her experience with The Groundlings. She credited the troupe with &quot;honing her ability to come up with voices on demand,&quot; which included her skills when auditioning for &quot;Family Dog&quot;. In her interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 1999, Bergman stated that she had &quot;more of a range as [she has] gotten older&quot;.

== Influences ==
At an early age, Bergman envisioned herself becoming a film star. At the age of six or seven, her mother took Bergman to watch a theatrical re-release of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. Bergman cited it as an inspiration to crossover from a mere fan to a performer, stating that the film &quot;made a complete impression&quot; on her. Shortly thereafter, Bergman began impersonating everything, including Lily Tomlin on &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; and her neighbor&#x27;s barking dogs. Voice actor Frank Welker, one of Bergman&#x27;s mentors, was also cited as an inspiration to her outlook.

== Successors ==
Bergman&#x27;s friend and student Grey DeLisle inherited the role of Daphne Blake in the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; franchise. 

Voice actress Tara Strong replaced Bergman as the voice of Timmy Turner in &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, as well as redubbing Bergman&#x27;s lines from the &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot; era.

<doc id="473292" wikidata="Q1243545" url="?curid=473292" title="Publius Servilius Casca">
<text>Publius Servilius Casca Longus (died ) was one of the assassins of Julius Caesar and plebeian tribune in 43 BC. He and several other senators conspired to kill him, a plan which they carried out on 15 March 44 BC. Afterward, Casca fought with the liberators during the Liberators&#x27; civil war. He is believed to have died at the Battle of Phillipi either by suicide or at the hands of Octavian&#x27;s forces.

==Life==
Despite his being initially a childhood friend of Caesar, Casca and his brother Titedius joined in the assassination. Casca struck the first blow, attacking Caesar from behind and hitting his bare shoulders, after Tillius Cimber had distracted the dictator by grabbing his toga. Caesar replied &quot;Casca, you villain, what are you doing?&quot; and tussled with him for several seconds. Casca simultaneously shouted to his brother in Greek, &quot;Brother, help me!&quot; The other assassins then joined in.

In December 44 BC, Casca assumed office as plebeian tribune. No unrest was associated with his taking office and he allied himself with Cicero and Brutus&#x27; mother Servilia. However, after Octavian marched on Rome during the War of Mutina, Casca fled the city and joined Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus, the leaders of the assassins, in the Liberators&#x27; civil war against the Second Triumvirate of Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian. When he fled the city, his colleague, Publius Titius, had Casca&#x27;s tribunate abrogated. He seems to have died, probably by suicide, in the aftermath of their defeat at the Battle of Philippi, in October 42 BC. There is no reference to him in any of the sources after this date.

Casca is commemorated on a coin along with Brutus, in which a bearded figure is depicted next to his name. However, this appears to be the god Neptune rather than a portrait of Casca. Elmley Lovett in England is the place where a coin hoard was found to include a rare Roman Republican silver denarius of Brutus with Casca Longus struck at a mint moving with Brutus 43-42 BC.

A house containing a table inscribed with his name is found in Pompeii.

==Dramatic depictions==

* He is called &quot;envious Casca&quot; by Mark Antony in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1599). He is also referred to as &quot;dull&quot; and having a &quot;sour fashion&quot;. He speaks in prose more frequently than the other characters who usually speak in verse.
**&quot;See what a rent the envious Casca made&quot;. The two words became the title of a mystery novel by Georgette Heyer.
* In the 1934 film &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, Casca is portrayed by Edwin Maxwell.
* In the 1937–38 Mercury Theatre stage production &quot;Caesar&quot;, Publius was played by Joseph Cotten.
* In the 1953 film of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, Casca is portrayed by Edmond O&#x27;Brien.

<text>The Great Council of Chiefs () is a Fijian constitutional body. It previously existed from 1876 to March 2012 and was restored in May 2023.

It is different from the House of Chiefs, a larger body that includes all hereditary chiefs, although membership of the two bodies overlapped to a considerable extent. The Great Council of Chiefs in its most recent form was established under Section 116 of the now-defunct 1997 Constitution, but it actually predated the Constitution by many years, having been established by the British colonial rulers as an advisory body in 1876, two years after Fiji was ceded to the United Kingdom.

The current chairperson is Viliame Seruvakula.

==History==

The Council was established in 1876 under the governorship of Sir Arthur Gordon. The decision was taken following consultations with chiefs, who advised Sir Arthur on how best to govern the colony&#x27;s indigenous population. In the words of anthropologist Robert Norton, it &quot;embodied the privileged relationship of trust and protection established between the Fijians and the British&quot;.

During the colonial era, meetings of the Great Council of Chiefs were held every year or two, &quot;with rich ceremonial protocol&quot;, and chaired by the British governor. Council members advised the governor with regards to policy on indigenous affairs, and, until 1963, selected indigenous representatives for the colonial Parliament. Among its nominees to Parliament in the 1950s and early 1960s were Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, Ratu George Cakobau, Ratu Edward Cakobau and Ratu Penaia Ganilau, who were to ascend to positions of leadership in government. In 1963, this function of the Council was abolished as indigenous Fijians obtained the right to elect their representatives to Parliament.

In the 1950s, the Council ceased to be reserved for chiefs; its &quot;membership [...] was broadened to allow representation of trade unions and other urban organizations&quot;. All members remained indigenous, however.

Fiji&#x27;s first Constitution, adopted upon independence in 1970, gave the Council the right to nominate eight of the twenty-two members of the Senate.

Following the 1987 military coup conducted by Sitiveni Rabuka, the Council reverted to being an exclusively aristocratic body, its membership reserved to high chiefs. Rabuka argued that hereditary chiefs should retain paramount decision-making power.

The 1990 Constitution thus enhanced the Council&#x27;s power. It was now authorised to appoint 24 of the Senate&#x27;s 34 members, making the Senate a GCC-dominated body. The Council would also, henceforth, appoint the president of Fiji and the vice-president.

The 1997 Constitution reduced its representation in the Senate to 14 members (out of 32), but recognised its right to name President and vice-president.

From the late 1980s onwards, the Great Council of Chiefs was compromised by manipulation from the government. Following the coup of 2000, however, it worked, with mixed success, to regain its independence. In 2001, it dismissed 1987 coup leader and former prime minister Sitiveni Rabuka from the chairmanship, in the midst of allegations about his possible involvement in the coup of 2000. It also cut its former ties with the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (which it originally sponsored in the early 1990s), and declared its intention to eschew party politics in the future, although individual members of the Council would, of course, remain free to participate in politics as individuals.

In June 2004, the Great Council of Chiefs was plunged into crisis when the government decided not to reappoint &quot;Ratu&quot; Epeli Ganilau as one of its six representatives on the Great Council; the Cakaudrove Provincial Council did not give him one of their three seats either. These decisions had the effect of prematurely ending Ganilau&#x27;s term as Chairman of the Council, as its regulations require the chairman to be a member. It is thought that Ganilau&#x27;s open disagreement with several senior government figures, including Vice-President &quot;Ratu&quot; Jope Seniloli and Information Minister Simione Kaitani, along with fears that he was undermining the neutrality of the Great Council to use it as a platform from which to advance his own political ambitions, were factors in the Cakaudrove Provincial Council&#x27;s decision. He was replaced by &quot;Ratu&quot; Ovini Bokini, who was thought to be more sympathetic to the government. Bokini was re-elected to a full three-year term on 27 July 2005, and Ratu Sakiusa Makutu of Nadroga-Navosa was chosen as his Deputy, succeeding Ro Jone Mataitini, who decided not to seek re-election.

Despite Fiji&#x27;s membership of the Commonwealth of Nations at that time as a republic, the Great Council recognised Queen Elizabeth II as its traditional Queen or paramount chief.

On 20 April 2005, the Fijian government announced plans to grant greater formal powers to the Great Council. This proposal was immediately opposed by Fiji Labour Party leader Mahendra Chaudhry, who said it would lead to &quot;dual government&quot; in Fiji, and also drew criticism from &quot;Ratu&quot; Epeli Ganilau. The former chairman of the Great Council, now the interim president of the National Alliance Party, said that he believed that the powers of the Council were already sufficient.

In a controversial move, the Great Council decided on 28 July 2005 to endorse the government&#x27;s Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill, which aimed to establish a commission empowered to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the 2000 coup. Opponents, including former Great Council chairman Ganilau, said that it was just a legal device to free government supporters who had been convicted and imprisoned on coup-related charges.

The Council was suspended in April 2007 by Commodore Frank Bainimarama, author of the December 2006 military coup. It was not, however, abolished. In February 2008, the interim government announced that Bainimarama, as Minister for Indigenous Affairs, was appointing himself chairman of the Council. As chairman, he would appoint all other members, acting on the recommendation of the provincial councils, and would have the authority to discipline, suspend, or dismiss any member.

The interim government asked provinces to submit nominees for the Great Council of Chiefs by 15 July 2008. If certain provinces did not provide nominees, Bainimarama would name GCC members to represent those provinces himself.

On 5 August 2008, it was announced that the Great Council of Chiefs was ready to reconvene. It would be composed of three chiefs from each of the fourteen provinces, and would be chaired by the Minister for Fijian Affairs, who at that time was Commodore Bainimarama.

On 14 March 2012, Bainimarama announced that President Ratu Epeli Nailatikau had &quot;approved decrees that formally de-establish the Great Council of the Chiefs&quot;. He accused the Council of having &quot;become politicised to the detriment of Fiji&#x27;s pursuit of a common and equal citizenry&quot;.

The 2022 Fijian general election saw Fiji elect a hung parliament. Four parties won seats in the Fijian Parliament: the governing FijiFirst party of then-Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, the new People&#x27;s Alliance party of former prime minister Sitiveni Rabuka, the National Federation Party (NFP) of Biman Prasad and the Social Democratic Liberal Party (SODELPA) of Bill Gavoka. While the NFP had already agreed to support the People&#x27;s Alliance before the election, SODELPA had not given a position prior to the election and was thus made the kingmaker. SODELPA subsequently joined the People&#x27;s Alliance-NFP coalition under certain conditions, one of which was bringing back the Great Council of Chiefs. These conditions were agreed upon.

In April 2023, President Wiliame Katonivere confirmed that the Council would return and hold its first meeting in May 2023. The reconstitution ceremony took place on the island of Bau on May 24, 2023. National champion &quot;Ratu&quot; Banuve Tabakaucoro received the honour in welcoming the state president and prime minister with the ceremonial offering of kava. &quot;Ratu&quot; Viliame Seruvakula was elected as its chairman in 2024.

== Historical composition ==

The Great Council had most recently consisted of 55 members, mainly hereditary chiefs along with some specially qualified commoners. The composition was as follows:

* The president of Fiji &quot;(ex officio)&quot;
* The vice-president of Fiji &quot;(ex officio)&quot;
* The prime minister of Fiji &quot;(ex officio)&quot;
* 6 members appointed by the president, on the advice of the Minister for Fijian Affairs
* 42 provincial councillors (3 chosen by each of Fiji&#x27;s 14 provincial councils)
* 3 representatives of the Council of Rotuma
* 1 life member (Sitiveni Rabuka)

These arrangements came into being on 9 June 1990. Previously, 22 parliamentarians holding seats allocated to indigenous Fijians held membership &quot;ex officio&quot; in the Great Council of Chiefs, along with 2 or 3 representatives from each of the 14 provincial councils. In addition, there were 8 chiefs and 7 commoners chosen by the Minister for Fijian Affairs. Following two military coups in 1987, the Council decided to abolish the right of elected parliamentarians to hold &quot;ex officio&quot; council membership, and to reduce the number of government appointees.

Except for the life member (1987 Fiji coups d&#x27;état leader and current Prime Minister of Fiji, Sitiveni Rabuka), all members served four-year terms.

The Council also recognized Elizabeth II, former Queen of Fiji, as Paramount Chief, but she was not formally a member of the Council.

== Constitutional role ==

In the 2013 Constitution, there has not been any role assigned to the Great Council of Chiefs.

According to the 1997 Constitution, the Great Council of Chiefs had two major powers:
*It functioned as an electoral college to elect the president and vice-president of Fiji, for a five-year term. In certain circumstances prescribed by the Constitution, it might remove the president or vice-president from office, in the case of felony, incompetence, negligence, or being unable to carry out their constitutional duties.
*It chose 14 of the 32 members of the Senate. (Although senators were ceremonially appointed by the president, his role was a mere formality: the Constitution obligated him to accept and appoint the 14 nominees chosen by the council, as well as 18 senators nominated by other institutions (Prime Minister 9, Leader of the Opposition 8, Council of Rotuma 1). Filling nearly half of the seats in the Senate, the nominees of the Great Council of Chiefs had an effective veto if they voted as a block, as they were almost certain to be joined by enough of the other senators to muster a majority. They did not always vote as a block, however: Fiji&#x27;s chiefs are a very diverse body. In practice, the Great Council of Chiefs delegated its prerogative of choosing Senators to Fiji&#x27;s fourteen &quot;provincial councils&quot;, with each province choosing one senator.

In addition to these constitutionally mandated functions, the Great Council of Chiefs had other roles that might from time to time be prescribed by law. In addition, it was considered almost compulsory for the government to consult and secure the approval of the Council before making major changes to the Constitution, although nothing in the Constitution required it to do so.

<text>Signal to Noise () is a graphic novel written by Neil Gaiman and illustrated by Dave McKean. It was originally serialised in the UK style magazine &quot;The Face&quot;, beginning in 1989, and collected as a graphic novel in 1992, published by Victor Gollancz Ltd in the UK and by Dark Horse Comics in the US.

The story follows a film-maker who suffers from a terminal illness, and imagines a last film which he will never have time to make. It examines the relationship between apocalyptic imagery, and the central character&#x27;s personal disaster.

There have been three adaptations of the graphic novel into other media: 
* In 1996, Gaiman adapted his own story for a BBC radio broadcast, with music by McKean.
* In 1999, a stage adaptation written by Marc Rosenbush and Robert Toombs was mounted in Chicago with Gaiman&#x27;s cooperation.
* In 2002, McKean adapted it into a 14-minute film, with Heathcote Williams as the director.

<text>No Highway is a 1948 novel by Nevil Shute. It formed the basis of the 1951 film &quot;No Highway in the Sky&quot;.

A scientist has been claiming that certain parts of a new aircraft called a Reindeer will develop metal fatigue sooner than officially estimated, but nobody takes him seriously. While flying to the site of an air crash that killed a Soviet ambassador, he discovers that his own plane is a Reindeer which has already flown twice its permitted number of hours. He uses his technical knowledge to sabotage it as soon as it lands, putting his credibility further in doubt.

The plot weaves together many themes, such as attitudes to safety, conflicts of interest between management and professionals, Cold War diplomacy, single parenthood and clairvoyance, before the scientist&#x27;s theory is finally vindicated. As the novel appears to presage some later real-life disasters and is based on just-emerging knowledge of metal fatigue, it is said to be one of few novels to reveal a new engineering truth.

Shute was a pioneer aircraft designer and co-founder of the aircraft construction company Airspeed Ltd.

==Characters==
* Theodore Honey: A middle-aged widower and experienced scientist at the Royal Aircraft Establishment Farnborough, Hampshire (RAE), working on safety;
* Dr Dennis Scott: Younger, dynamic aeronauticist and recently appointed head of the structural department at the RAE, brought in to &#x27;downsize&#x27; the department;
* Marjorie Corder: Airline stewardess, in her mid-20s and tiring of the &quot;glamorous life&quot; with the fictional C.A.T.O.;
* Monica Teasdale, an older, middle-echelon Hollywood actress, facing a lonely retirement;
* Captain Samuelson: veteran pilot of the Reindeer, highly respected;
* Elspeth: Honey&#x27;s twelve-year-old daughter;
* Shirley Scott: Dr Scott&#x27;s wife, a local schoolteacher.

==Plot==
The narrator is Dr Scott, brought in to downsize his department, and the plot concerns his consideration of Theodore Honey, who initially comes across as an unlikely hero. Mr Honey, a widower, does not live a conventional British life, and is bringing up his young daughter, Elspeth, alone. He is engaged in research on the fatigue of aluminium airframes. He is currently investigating possible failure in the high aspect ratio tailplane of a new airliner, the fictional &quot;Rutland Reindeer&quot;.

Honey is nervous and distrusting of the &#x27;new broom&#x27;, is unimpressive in appearance and is so intensely focused on his work that his relations with the outside world – never that good to begin with – suffer badly. Throughout the story, people judge him by that appearance, or by his varied and unconventional outside interests, such as pyramidology, the study of possible esoteric interpretations of the Pyramids.

Honey has predicted, by a (fictional) theory supposedly related to quantum mechanics, that it is possible for an aluminium alloy structure to fail long before the design lifetime predicted by the usual design standards. He is using a spare tailplane from a Reindeer aircraft in a fatigue test. Honey&#x27;s theory predicts that the metal at the root of the tailplane will suffer from metal fatigue and fail with a crystalline fracture.

Before Dr Scott&#x27;s arrival, despite Honey&#x27;s concerns, the aircraft had recently been allowed into service. Honey&#x27;s work is regarded as likely to falsify his far-fetched theory, rather than raising a significant safety issue. But the newly arrived Mr Scott links it with the recent crash of a Reindeer carrying the Soviet ambassador, which had total flying hours close to Honey&#x27;s estimate, and which crashed in northeastern Quebec. The crash report, including photographs, is inconclusive, and Scott feels that the remains of the aircraft must be physically examined.

Honey is sent to Canada to examine the debris of the crash, travelling on board a Reindeer aircraft on which he meets the two heroines of the novel, Corder and Teasdale. During the flight, Honey discovers from the cockpit crew that the flying hours of this aircraft are twice those of any other Reindeer in service, and are close to his predicted failure time. He becomes increasingly anxious for its safety. He confides in Teasdale, whose films he admires, and goes on to give her some advice on the safest place to go in the aircraft in the event of a crash. Despite his alarm, he remains persuasive and sincere, and impresses Corder and Teasdale. He also impresses the pilot, Samuelson, who knew the captain of the recently crashed Reindeer and had rejected with scorn the official inquiry&#x27;s conclusion that the crash was the result of pilot error.

During a heated discussion during a stopover at Gander International Airport, Honey realises that he has failed to persuade anyone to declare the Reindeer unfit for service, and in desperation, he disables it by raising its undercarriage while it is standing on the tarmac, leaving the aircraft damaged and unable to move.

Honey is recalled to Farnborough after this sabotage, but he is delayed because C.A.T.O., the fictional operator of the damaged aircraft, refuses to carry him. While he is away, trouble arises on a second front. For the duration of his trip, he has left Elspeth in their shabby, neglected home in Farnham, with only the supervision of the unreliable cleaning woman.

Shirley Scott finds Elspeth unconscious, confirming her misgivings about the state of Honey&#x27;s home life, and nurses her. Elspeth displays a touching mix of precocity and serious intelligence, but betrays Honey&#x27;s hobbies of spiritualism and prophecy. That notwithstanding, Elspeth&#x27;s outlook is tempered with serious thought and childhood happiness in simple things.

Teasdale visits Dr Scott at Farnborough and relates her story of events to the Director of the RAE before offering Elspeth some feminine care and affection. Her affection for Honey is obvious, but she realises it is not to be – she cannot give him children or sustain him in his work. She is rapidly followed by Corder, who bears Honey&#x27;s letter of resignation to Scott and her own account of the events in Gander.

By the time Honey returns, Scott has left for Canada to retrieve the tailplane roots. On reaching the crash site he discovers that the parts of the aircraft adjacent to where the tailplane separated have been removed by the Soviet party who came to recover the body of their Ambassador. The Soviet authorities suspect that the crash was part of a plot to assassinate the ambassador, and are wholly unhelpful when approached for information about the missing tailplane root.

The tailplane itself remains lost in the wilderness, but must be found if there is any hope of proving the existence of metal fatigue. Honey comes to the rescue, but in a highly unorthodox way. He puts his daughter into a light trance which, to Corder&#x27;s shock, Elspeth has clearly experienced before.

Using a planchette and automatic writing, a message is written: &quot;UNDER THE FOOT OF THE BEAR&quot;. Sceptical of the message&#x27;s value, the Director refuses to send it to Scott, and a heated exchange follows. The Director points out that &quot;the bear&quot; could just as plausibly refer merely to the Soviet Union and that the message tells them no more than they already know. With Corder&#x27;s and Samuelson&#x27;s help and their C.A.T.O. contacts, Honey manages to have the message passed to Scott in the Canadian woods. Scott and his party work out that &quot;the bear&quot; could refer to a lake, Dancing Bear Water, 30 or 40 miles back along the flight path of the lost aircraft, and there, in due course, they find the tailplane.

Its front spar root reveals a classic fatigue fracture. The find vindicates Honey&#x27;s theory and makes him a minor hero in aviation circles – to which he is indifferent. His early warning even allows for a timely redesign by the manufacturers, ensuring no loss of service of the Reindeers over the Atlantic and allowing the safety issue to be hushed-up. But Dr Scott goes on to take safety more seriously than had been previous practice. Corder and Honey finally marry one another.

==Aircraft types==
Rutland Reindeer: Built by the Rutland Aircraft Company, in service with C.A.T.O, then regularly plying the Atlantic. Powered by eight engines with four contra-rotating propellers (four nacelles carrying two engines each), the Reindeer can best be imagined to resemble the Bristol Brabazon, whose future development would also have included jet power, and Shute notes this late in the novel. It is described as a low-wing monoplane with a nosewheel-type undercarriage and a single tail. In the movie, 

Assegai Mk.1 powered by a Boreus afterburning turbojet. At the end of the novel this aircraft is under investigation by Dr Scott because three of them have been lost through transonic disintegration. This parallels the late development of the Gloster Meteor, whose later versions featured powerful engines providing more thrust than the airframe was designed to accommodate. They also suffered from transonic buffeting in powered dives; two were lost to tail separation. The problem in the latter cases was that the aircraft had not been designed using the transonic area rule, its aerodynamics being unsuited to stable flight in the transonic envelope, causing problems such as structural flutter (felt by the pilot as buffeting) and control reversals – both of which would have been most likely to be present in a high-speed dive.

Avro Lancaster NX636 is shown as the RAF aircraft that returns Theodore Honey to his employer at Farnborough after C.A.T.O. refuse to carry him either further, or to return him back, to the United Kingdom. Management at the Royal Aircraft Establishment consider the RAF obliged to accept the risk of carrying a potentially unhinged person as part of their regular flying duties.

==Allusions/references to actual history, geography and current science==
Part of the novel is set in Canada (and in the Dominion of Newfoundland which had not yet, in the year 1949, become a part of Canada), a country that was very much &quot;the Northern American land of dreams&quot; for Shute—following his visit there in the 1930s aboard the dirigible R100, on whose development he had worked as a member of the design team under Barnes Wallis.

One observer has suggested that Shute may have been influenced in his description of the crash site by the 1946 crash at Hare Mountain (later Crash Hill), Newfoundland, of a Douglas C-54E which killed 39 people.

==Title==
The title is taken from &quot;The Wanderer&quot; by John Masefield which Shute quotes at the start of the book:
:&quot;Therefore, go forth, companion: when you find&quot;
:&quot;No Highway more, no track, all being blind,&quot;
:&quot;The way to go shall glimmer in the mind.&quot;

==Publication history==
* First published in 1948 by William Heinemann, London.
* Reprinted in 2001 under .

The initial US publication took place at the end of August 1948. But on publication BOAC objected to the use of its name without permission, and associated with aircraft disasters. It threatened to sue Heinemann unless its name was removed. British publication was therefore delayed until 13 December while all references to BOAC were changed to CATO.

==Adaptations==
The film adaptation of the novel was released in 1951, starring James Stewart as Honey, Jack Hawkins as Scott, and Marlene Dietrich as Teasdale. The film was released as &quot;No Highway in the Sky&quot; in the United States and elsewhere. It presents Mr Honey as odd rather than being nervous at possible dismissal.

&quot;No Highway&quot;, a radio adaptation dramatised by Mike Walker with Paul Ritter as Honey, William Beck as Scott, and Fenella Woolgar as Teasdale was directed by Toby Swift for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s Classic Serial in August 2010.

An earlier BBC Radio 4 Classic Serial, dramatised by Brian Gear in three episodes, and broadcast weekly from 11 May 1986, starred John Clegg as Theodore Honey, Norman Bowler as Scott, and Margaret Robertson as Monica Teasdale.

<doc id="473299" wikidata="Q676438" url="?curid=473299" title="Self-Realization Fellowship">
<text>Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF) is a worldwide religious organization founded in 1920 by Paramahansa Yogananda, the Indian guru who authored &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;. Before moving to the United States, Yogananda began his spiritual work in India in 1917 and named the organization Yogoda Satsanga Society of India (YSS). He moved to the West in 1920 and in 1925 established SRF&#x27;s headquarters at Mount Washington, Los Angeles, California. Before his return visit to India in 1935, he legally incorporated SRF in the United States, designating it as the only organization to carry on his work—to care for and disseminate his teachings.

Yogananda&#x27;s teachings include meditation techniques intended to promote awareness of God and one&#x27;s soul. SRF conveys these techniques through a home-study course, and they publish Yogananda&#x27;s books and lectures. SRF also coordinates the Worldwide Prayer Circle, which prays for world peace and those in need.

==Leadership==
Paramahansa Yogananda founded SRF in 1920 and served as head until his death on 7 March 1952. In 1925, he established the international headquarters for SRF/YSS at Mount Washington in Los Angeles, California. The three-story building had originally been opened in 1909 as a hotel. SRF now calls it &quot;Mother Center&quot;. After Yogananda&#x27;s death, SRF preserved his bedroom in the building as a shrine.

The first president and head of SRF/YSS after Yogananda was Rajarsi Janakananda, who was president until his death on 20 February 1955.

Daya Mata was the next head and president of Self Realization Fellowship/YSS from 1955 
until 30 November 2010, the end of her life. American yoga scholar Linda Johnsen wrote that Daya Mata was an example of a new wave of women who acquired leadership positions in Hindu spirituality.

In 2010, Mrinalini Mata became the next president of SRF/YSS, with the official announcement being on 9 January 2011. She held this position until her passing on 3 August 2017. She had been chosen by Yogananda to oversee his publications after his death, and she had held the position of SRF/YSS vice-president from 1966 until she became president in 2011.

On 30 August 2017, Brother Chidananda was elected as the next and current president with a unanimous vote of the SRF Board of Directors.

=== Monastic order ===
SRF is run by members of its monastic order, established by Yogananda in the early 1930s. SRF&#x27;s monks and nuns coordinate the organization&#x27;s retreats, youth programs, temple services, and publishing and translation efforts. They also coordinate the Worldwide Prayer Circle, a network of groups and individuals who pray for world peace and those in need.

According to SRF&#x27;s website, the daily life of an SRF renunciant includes meditation, prayer, service, spiritual study, introspection, exercise, and recreation. There are four stages of life in the SRF monastic order that represent a deepening commitment to the renunciant life: postulancy, novitiate, brahmacharya, and sannyas. Monks and nuns of the SRF Order who take their final renunciant vows are members of the Swami Order, which traces its spiritual lineage back to Adi Shankara.

==Teachings==
Yogananda first introduced his teachings to the West during an international congress of religious leaders held in Boston, MA in 1920 while giving a talk called &quot;The Science of Religion&quot;. Yogananda believed that his methods were testable. Yogananda&#x27;s dissemination of his teachings continues through SRF, which he incorporated in 1935 as a nonprofit religious organization. According to author Lola Williamson in her book, &quot;Transcendent in America: Hindu-inspired Meditation Movements as New Religion&quot;, &quot;He (Yogananda) made it clear that his teachings were to be shared through Self-Realization Fellowship and not through rogue organizations that taught in his name.&quot;

Yogananda&#x27;s autobiography contains a list of aims and ideals for SRF, and the first of these is to disseminate &quot;scientific techniques for attaining direct personal experience of God&quot;. Another is &quot;to advocate cultural and spiritual understanding between East and West&quot;. SRF teaches methods of concentration and meditation, including a technique called &quot;kriya yoga&quot;, for the purpose of attaining what Yogananda called &quot;Self-realization&quot;. Yogananda used this term to signify the realization of one&#x27;s true Self or soul. SRF presents Eastern and Western religious teachings as essentially one and the same by including passages from both the Bhagavad Gita and the New Testament in their services. SRF also publishes Yogananda&#x27;s works, which include his home-study lessons, autobiography, lectures, and recorded talks.

SRF funded the 2014 documentary &quot;&quot;, which was co-directed by Paola Di Florio and Lisa Leeman.

=== Kriya Yoga ===

SRF initiates prepared students in a technique called &quot;kriya yoga&quot; that they say hastens the process of spiritual awakening. Through deep and regular practice, the technique is supposed to withdraw one&#x27;s energy and attention from distracting thoughts, emotions, and stimuli, so that one may experience peace and attunement with God in the resulting stillness. SRF requires aspiring disciples to first undertake a home-study course called the &quot;SRF Lessons&quot;, compiled from Yogananda&#x27;s teachings. In keeping with Upanishadic tradition, recipients of SRF&#x27;s lessons pledge not to share the contents with others. In SRF, receiving the kriya yoga technique is seen as &quot;diksha&quot; (initiation) by the guru, Yogananda, and it involves an initiation rite conducted by an authorized representative. SRF sends disciples printed kriya yoga lessons even if they cannot attend the rite.

==Temples, retreats, and other facilities==


Self-Realization Fellowship has over 600 temples and meditation centers located in 62 countries. Of the temples, there are eight in the United States – seven in California and one in Arizona:

* Bay Area Temple, Walnut Creek
* Encinitas Temple
* Fullerton Temple
* Glendale Temple
* Hollywood Temple
* Lake Shrine Temple, Pacific Palisades
* San Diego Temple
* Phoenix Temple

SRF also runs retreat centers:

* Lake Shrine in Pacific Palisades, CA
* Hidden Valley Ashram (for men) in Escondido, CA
* Greenfield Retreat (for women) in Front Royal, Virginia
* Bermersbach Retreat in Germany
* Armação Retreat in Santa Catarina, Brazil.

SRF has a sister organization in India called Yogoda Satsanga Society of India (YSS), founded by Yogananda in 1917 and headquartered in Dakshineswar (near Calcutta). YSS oversees 200 &quot;kendras&quot;, &quot;mandalis&quot;, retreats, and ashrams throughout India and Nepal, along with more than 20 educational and medical facilities.

=== Encinitas Hermitage ===

After his return from India in 1936, Yogananda took up residence at the SRF hermitage in Encinitas, California, which was a surprise gift from his disciple Rajarsi Janakananda. It was while at this hermitage that Yogananda wrote &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; and other writings, creating a permanent foundation for the humanitarian and spiritual work of SRF/YSS. This property includes an ashram.

=== Hollywood Temple ===
On 30 August 1942, Yogananda opened the SRF Hollywood Temple on Sunset Blvd., Hollywood, California. It is the oldest SRF temple in the US. According to Phil Goldberg, Yogananda dedicated it to &quot;the ideal of human brotherhood and the definite realization of God as the One Father of all mankind.&quot; Meghan Markle&#x27;s parents, Doria Ragland and Thomas Markle Sr. were married by Brother Bhaktananda at Hollywood Temple on 23 December 1979.

=== Lake Shrine ===

The Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine is located on Sunset Boulevard in Pacific Palisades, California. It was dedicated by Yogananda, on 20 August 1950, as a 10-acre spiritual center honoring the five major world religions. It is set in a hillside amphitheater with gardens and a spring-fed lake, and it is home to swans, ducks, koi, water turtles, lotus flowers, a Dutch windmill, and a golden lotus archway that is painted white and topped with gold lotus blossoms. The archway frames the Mahatma Gandhi World Peace Memorial, an outdoor shrine where a 1,000-year-old Chinese sarcophagus holds a portion of Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s ashes.

=== San Diego Temple ===
Yogananda established San Diego Temple in Bankers Hill, San Diego, on 5 September 1943, during World War II. The front walkway of the temple is lined with cypress trees planted by Yogananda. In 1945, Mrinilini Mata, then fourteen-year-old Merna Brown, first met Yogananda at this temple and a year later entered the ashram in Encinitas.

=== Twentynine Palms ===
Yogananda spent most of the last four years of his life in seclusion at his desert ashram in Twentynine Palms, California, with some of his closest disciples. There he completed his writings, including the revisions of his books, articles and lessons written previously.

==Reception, views and controversies==
As of 1992, SRF had several hundred thousand members. It has enjoyed widespread influence through its publications, but it has struggled to preserve the confidentiality of the lessons from its home-study course – similar lessons have been shared by unaffiliated sources. SRF has responded by including in its publications a copyright statement and a certification that SRF is the society founded by Yogananda to convey his teachings.

=== Celebrity involvement ===
George Harrison frequently cited SRF&#x27;s founder, Yogananda, as an important spiritual influence. On visits to Los Angeles, George Harrison would spend time at the SRF retreat in Encinitas. The SRF organization strictly honored its members&#x27; privacy, which Harrison appreciated. According to Straight Arrow Press, in the United States the &quot;proceeds from the January 14, 2002, reissue of George Harrison&#x27;s 1970 song &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; will go to the Self-Realization Fellowship&quot;. His funeral was held at SRF&#x27;s Lake Shrine.

Ravi Shankar had met Yogananda in the 1930s and gave his first U.S. concert at the SRF Encinitas Retreat, Encinitas, California in 1957.

Elvis Presley often visited SRF in the late 1960s. According to Louis Sahagun of the LA Times, Brother Paramananda, &quot;who left a promising acting career to devote his life to the fellowship&quot;, claimed Elvis had once said to him: &quot;Man, you made the right choice. People don&#x27;t know my life or that I sometimes cry myself to sleep because I don&#x27;t know God.&quot;

=== Lawsuit with Kriyananda ===

In 1990, SRF filed suit against James Donald Walters (aka Kriyananda) and his organization, Ananda Church of Self-Realization, regarding Ananda&#x27;s use of &quot;Self-Realization&quot; in their name and their use of specific writings, photographs and recordings of Paramahansa Yogananda. According to Louis Sahagún of the Los Angeles Times, SRF wanted &quot;to secure exclusive rights to Yogananda&#x27;s teachings, name, likeness, voice and use of the term &#x27;self-realization&#x27;.&quot; The litigation lasted for around twelve years (1990–2002) and in 2002 the final jury trial was held in the US District Court for the Eastern District of California. Jurors ultimately agreed with Self-Realization Fellowship&#x27;s argument that Yogananda had repeatedly made his intentions clear before dying – he wanted the Fellowship to maintain copyrights to his works. The court ordered Ananda to pay about $29,000 to SRF for its earnings from SRF&#x27;s sound recordings, and a judge suggested that Ananda not remove &quot;Ananda&quot; from its name, to which it agreed. However, the court did not require Ananda to pay damages for using written works for educational or religious purposes. It also determined that the terms &quot;Paramahansa Yogananda&quot; and &quot;self-realization&quot; could not be trademarked.

=== Paternity claim ===
Ben Erskine accused Yogananda of having an illicit affair with his mother, Adelaide, a disciple and photographer of Yogananda&#x27;s in the late 1920s. According to Erskine, his mother never told him who his father was but he assumed it was Yogananda because his skin was darker than his siblings. In 1995 Erskine&#x27;s daughter, Peggy, took it a step further and gave SRF paternity claims along with financial demands. The attorneys for SRF initiated DNA testing with hair samples and then a second round of testing using blood samples which concluded there was no relationship. Erskine and his attorney, Shane Reed, rejected the results as biased because a monk in the order oversaw it. To settle the claims, SRF established an independent testing process. They hired a San Diego former criminal prosecutor, G. Michael Still, to compare the DNA from Yogananda&#x27;s three male relatives in India to Erskine&#x27;s DNA. The lab work was done in two separate labs, one in Missouri and one in Louisiana. The results from both labs were identical, showing no relationship between Yogananda and Erskine.

=== SRF expansion project ===
SRF submitted a draft of their expansion project for its headquarters atop Mt. Washington, Los Angeles, CA. According to the Los Angeles Times, the permit allowed, over a 30-year period, the construction of a &quot;museum, additional office space, classrooms, counseling facilities, underground parking and more living quarters for cloistered monks and nuns…&quot; and a site to reinter Yogananda&#x27;s remains, which would have been removed from Forest Lawn Memorial-Park. This plan caused disagreement in the local hillside community. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that &quot;Supporters say that the church is a good neighbor and that its expansion would not harm the community&#x27;s character. Opponents say the expansion project would be too big for a hilltop area of only 8,000 residents. As emotions have risen, some neighbors have even stopped talking to one another.&quot; SRF withdrew the plan when it realized it did not have widespread support from the local residents. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, church spokesman Brother Brahmananda said &quot;We hope that this is a catalyst to promote greater harmony within the community.&quot;

<doc id="473304" wikidata="Q2519089" url="?curid=473304" title="Bödvar Bjarki">
<text>Bödvar Bjarki ( ), meaning &#x27;Warlike Little-Bear&#x27;, is the hero appearing in tales of Hrólfr Kraki in the &quot;Hrólfs saga kraka&quot;, in the Latin epitome to the lost &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot;, and as &quot;Biarco&quot; in Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; . He is often depicted with the ability to shapeshift into a bear.

==Legend==
Bjarki&#x27;s father, Björn (which means &quot;bear&quot;), was the son of Hring, a King in Norway. After Björn&#x27;s mother died, Hring married a much younger Sámi woman called Hvit. Björn became a tall, strong young man, and he and a young woman named Bera were in love.

At a time when Hring was away, Hvit tried to seduce Björn, but he rejected her. She cast a spell that made him a bear by day and a man only by night. He fled to the area near Bera&#x27;s father&#x27;s farm, where he lived by killing livestock, and he brought Bera to live with him. Urged by Hvit, the king took his hunters to kill the bear. Björn foresaw his death and told Bera that she was pregnant, telling her what to do after his death. The hunters killed him, and Bera went to the celebration, where his carcass was cooked. Despite his instruction not to eat any of the meat, Hvit pressured her into eating one bite.

Bera had triplets, all boys. The first to be born, Elgfróði (Elk-Frodi), had the body of a Eurasian elk from the waist down. The second, Thorir, had the feet of a hound. Bödvar Bjarki was the third, and he was normal.

All three grew exceptionally big and strong. At the age of twelve, Frodi got into trouble for fights in which he injured people and killed one of the king&#x27;s men, and he left to become a robber. Thorir became the king of Gautland (Geatland). Bjarki, the last to leave his mother, killed Hvit in revenge for his father&#x27;s death. When Hring died, Bjarki succeeded him.

After a time, he left the court and visited Elk-Froði, not revealing his identity. Frodi challenged him to wrestle. Bjarki did much better than Frodi expected, but when Frodi recognized him, he thought Bjarki was still not strong enough, so he had Bjarki drink some of his blood, which increased his strength greatly.

On Frodi&#x27;s advice, Bjarki visited Thorir in Gautland and then went to King Hrolf Kraki&#x27;s court at Lejre in Denmark. Newly arrived, he saved a weak young thrall named Hott from bullying. That night he fought and killed a monster that had killed many of the king&#x27;s warriors. He took Hott out to the carcass and forced him to drink the monster&#x27;s blood, making him strong and brave. They set up the carcass as if it were alive, and in the morning Hott pretended to kill it. As a reward the king gave him his gold-hilted sword and changed his name to Hjalti (meaning &quot;hilt&quot;).

One of Hrolf&#x27;s berserker warriors challenged Bjarki. Bjarki killed him and expelled his berserker companions. From then on he was considered Denmark&#x27;s greatest champion. He became a trusted adviser of the king as well as a leader in battle, and married the king&#x27;s daughter, Drifa. He advised Hrolf to go to Uppsala to reclaim the treasure of Hrolf&#x27;s father from King Adils, bringing about the well-known episode in which Hrolf and his men scattered the treasure to slow their pursuers and Hrolf humiliated Adils. On the way back, Hrolf angered a man who he later realized was Odin in disguise. Bjarki advised Hrolf to avoid war from then on, since he had lost the favor of the god of victory.

When Hrolf&#x27;s half-sister and her husband rebelled and attacked Lejre, Bjarki stayed in the hall in a trance. Meanwhile, a monstrous bear did heavy damage to the rebels&#x27; army. Hjalti, disturbed that Bjarki was not fighting, went to the hall and roused him. But the bear was Bjarki&#x27;s spirit, or hugr, and disappeared. Bjarki went out to fight, but not as effectively as the bear. The rebels overwhelmed the defenders and killed Hrolf, Bjarki, and all of Hrolf&#x27;s other warriors.

==&quot;Bjarkamál&quot;==

The Old Norse poem &quot;Bjarkamál&quot; (of which only a few stanzas are preserved but which Saxo Grammaticus presents in the form of a florid Latin paraphrase) is understood as a dialogue between Bödvar Bjarki and Hjalti which begins with Hjalti again and again urging Bödvar to awake and fight for King Hrólf in this last battle in which they are doomed to defeat. As mentioned above, this caused Bjarki&#x27;s spirit-bear to disappear. As Bjarki puts it on awakening, &quot;You have not been so helpful to the king by this action of yours as you think&quot;.

==Beowulf, folk-tales, and &quot;The Hobbit&quot;==

Some think Bjarki and the hero Beowulf in the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; were originally the same personage, and others instead accept some kinship between the two, perhaps pointing to the same distant source. Unlike Beowulf, Bjarki is a shapeshifter, and he is also said to have been Norwegian, which may be explained by the fact that his story was written by Icelandic authors who were mostly of Norwegian descent.

However, his brother was the king of Geatland and, like Beowulf, Bǫðvarr Bjarki arrived in Denmark from Geatland. Moreover, his killing of the monster that has been terrorizing the court at Yule for two years is comparable to Beowulf&#x27;s killing of Grendel. The name &quot;Beowulf&quot; may have originally meant &quot;bee-wolf&quot;, a kenning for &quot;bear&quot;, though other etymologies have been proposed.

Like Beowulf, Bödvar Bjarki has been linked to the folktales categorized as the Bear&#x27;s Son Tale.

Tom Shippey has said that the character of Beorn in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, by J. R. R. Tolkien, has &quot;a very close analogue&quot; in Bödvar Bjarki.

<doc id="473309" wikidata="Q311147" url="?curid=473309" title="Robert Kiyosaki">
<text>Robert Toru Kiyosaki (born April 8, 1947) is an American businessman and author, known for the &quot;Rich Dad Poor Dad&quot; series of personal finance books. He founded the Rich Dad Company, which provides personal finance and business education through books and videos, and Rich Global LLC, which filed for bankruptcy in 2012. 

Kiyosaki was sued in a class action suit filed by attendees of his seminars, and is the subject of investigative documentaries by the CBC, WTAE-TV and CBS News. In January 2024, Kiyosaki stated that he was more than $1-billion in debt.

== Early life and family ==
Kiyosaki was born in 1947 in Hilo, Territory of Hawaii, into a family of Japanese descent. His father, Ralph Kiyosaki, was an educator, Hawaii&#x27;s superintendent of schools, and a lieutenant governor candidate of the Republican Party. His mother, Marjorie Kiyosaki, was a nurse.

Kiyosaki graduated from Hilo High School, from which he was nearly expelled due to poor grades.

== Early career ==
In 1977, Kiyosaki started a company called &quot;Rippers&quot; that marketed nylon and Velcro wallets. The company eventually went bankrupt, and he took a job as a sales associate for Xerox until June 1978.

In the 1980s, Kiyosaki became a motivational speaker in San Diego who ran a course on Erhard Seminars Training (EST) techniques called Money and You, which he attended in 1974 from the course&#x27;s creator, Marshall Thurber. Thurber transferred the business to Kiyosaki and D.C. Cordova in 1984. They expanded the course beyond the U.S., including to Australia. The course at one point had tens of thousands of students internationally. The business nearly collapsed in Australia in October 1993 after the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s Four Corners aired a documentary about emotional abuse in the course of the Money and You program. Kiyosaki said the program was &quot;unfair&quot; and considered suing the ABC before deciding against it. He left the business in 1994.

== Financial education career ==

In 1993, Kiyosaki published his first book, &quot;If You Want to Be Rich and Happy, Don&#x27;t Go to School&quot;. In his book, he encouraged parents not to send their children to college and instead to enter the real estate business.

In 1997, Kiyosaki founded Cashflow Technologies, Inc., a holding company that owns and operates the &quot;Rich Dad&quot; and &quot;Cashflow&quot; brands. Kiyosaki created the Cashflow board and video games to educate adults and children about business and financial concepts.

Kiyosaki settled a lawsuit in 2008 brought by Sharon Lechter, his former business partner, with an undisclosed sum. Lechter said Kiyosaki and his wife had enriched themselves and redirected assets in the business, which the Kiyosakis denied. She sold her stake in Rich Dad Company to them after the settlement and ended the partnership that lasted about 10 years.

== Other businesses ==
Kiyosaki&#x27;s earlier two businesses (for surfing bags with Velcro fasteners and T-shirts) went bankrupt.

Kiyosaki operates through a number of companies that he owns fully or in part, and through franchisee arrangements with other companies authorized to use his name for a fee. This includes Rich Dad LLC, Whitney Information Network, Rich Dad Education and Rich Dad Academy. The company&#x27;s main revenues come from franchisees of the Rich Dad seminars that are conducted by independent individuals using Kiyosaki&#x27;s brand name.

In 2012, Kiyosaki&#x27;s company, Rich Global LLC, filed for bankruptcy and was ordered to pay $23.7 million to The Learning Annex and its founder because Kiyosaki had used The Learning Annex for speaking opportunities. Mike Sullivan, the CEO of Rich Dad Company, one of at least 10 companies through which Kiyosaki conducts business, said Rich Global LLC had been dormant for years. At bankruptcy, the company had nearly $26 million in liabilities and $1.8 million in assets.

== Business and financial advice ==
Kiyosaki has authored more than 26 books including &quot;Rich Dad Poor Dad&quot;, which has been translated into dozens of languages. As of 2017, nearly 40 million copies of the book had been sold. He said his books were an advertisement for his higher-priced seminars.

Kiyosaki&#x27;s financial and business teachings claim that financial independence can be achieved through passive income. He also claims that wealth cannot be achieved from going to school and obtaining a traditional job.

He advocates for using what he calls &quot;good debt&quot; as leverage to buy financial assets such as real estate. Additionally, he is a strong proponent of buying gold and silver, often referring to them as &quot;God&#x27;s money.&quot; In 2006 and 2007, Kiyosaki&#x27;s Rich Dad seminars continued to promote real estate as a sound investment, just before their prices came crashing down.

In 2010, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s &quot;Marketplace&quot; broadcast a documentary on scams that were being perpetuated by Kiyosaki&#x27;s company in Canada in the guise of &quot;Rich Dad&quot; seminars. Investments in trailers and trailer parks, which seminar instructors claimed to be evidence of success, were found to be barren and unused land.

Also in 2010, Allan Roth of CBS News documented what occurred when he attended one of Rich Dad&#x27;s free seminars and dissected some of the tactics employed.

WTAE-TV, the ABC television station in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, produced another critical segment about Kiyosaki in 2013.

Kiyosaki&#x27;s advice has also been criticized for emphasizing anecdotes and no concrete advice on how readers should proceed or work.

== Personal life ==
Kiyosaki divorced from his first wife when he was 32.

Kiyosaki met his second wife and business partner Kimberly &quot;Kim&quot; Kiyosaki (née Meyer) in 1984, and they got married in 1986. They amicably divorced in 2017.
When asked about his net worth, Kiyosaki claimed to be more than $1 billion in debt.

=== Political views ===
Kiyosaki endorsed and supported Republican candidate Donald Trump for the 2016 presidential elections. Kiyosaki had previously co-authored two books with Trump.

<doc id="473317" wikidata="Q653137" url="?curid=473317" title="Content analysis">
<text>Content analysis is the study of documents and communication artifacts, known as texts e.g. photos, speeches or essays. Social scientists use content analysis to examine patterns in communication in a replicable and systematic manner. One of the key advantages of using content analysis to analyse social phenomena is their non-invasive nature, in contrast to simulating social experiences or collecting survey answers.

Practices and philosophies of content analysis vary between academic disciplines. They all involve systematic reading or observation of texts or artifacts which are assigned labels (sometimes called codes) to indicate the presence of interesting, meaningful pieces of content. By systematically labeling the content of a set of texts, researchers can analyse patterns of content quantitatively using statistical methods, or use qualitative methods to analyse meanings of content within texts.

Computers are increasingly used in content analysis to automate the labeling (or coding) of documents. Simple computational techniques can provide descriptive data such as word frequencies and document lengths. Machine learning classifiers can greatly increase the number of texts that can be labeled, but the scientific utility of doing so is a matter of debate. Further, numerous computer-aided text analysis (CATA) computer programs are available that analyze text for predetermined linguistic, semantic, and psychological characteristics.

== Goals ==

Content analysis is best understood as a broad family of techniques. Effective researchers choose techniques that best help them answer their substantive questions. That said, according to Klaus Krippendorff, six questions must be addressed in every content analysis:

#Which data are analyzed?
#How are the data defined?
#From what population are data drawn?
#What is the relevant context?
#What are the boundaries of the analysis?
#What is to be measured?

The simplest and most objective form of content analysis considers unambiguous characteristics of the text such as word frequencies, the page area taken by a newspaper column, or the duration of a radio or television program. Analysis of simple word frequencies is limited because the meaning of a word depends on surrounding text. Key Word In Context (KWIC) routines address this by placing words in their textual context. This helps resolve ambiguities such as those introduced by synonyms and homonyms.

A further step in analysis is the distinction between dictionary-based (quantitative) approaches and qualitative approaches. Dictionary-based approaches set up a list of categories derived from the frequency list of words and control the distribution of words and their respective categories over the texts. While methods in quantitative content analysis in this way transform observations of found categories into quantitative statistical data, the qualitative content analysis focuses more on the intentionality and its implications. There are strong parallels between qualitative content analysis and thematic analysis.

== Qualitative and quantitative content analysis ==
Quantitative content analysis highlights frequency counts and statistical analysis of these coded frequencies. Additionally, quantitative content analysis begins with a framed hypothesis with coding decided on before the analysis begins. These coding categories are strictly relevant to the researcher&#x27;s hypothesis. Quantitative analysis also takes a deductive approach. Examples of content-analytical variables and constructs can be found, for example, in the open-access database DOCA. This database compiles, systematizes, and evaluates relevant content-analytical variables of communication and political science research areas and topics.

Siegfried Kracauer provides a critique of quantitative analysis, asserting that it oversimplifies complex communications in order to be more reliable. On the other hand, qualitative analysis deals with the intricacies of latent interpretations, whereas quantitative has a focus on manifest meanings. He also acknowledges an &quot;overlap&quot; of qualitative and quantitative content analysis. Patterns are looked at more closely in qualitative analysis, and based on the latent meanings that the researcher may find, the course of the research could be changed. It is inductive and begins with open research questions, as opposed to a hypothesis.

== Codebooks ==
The data collection instrument used in content analysis is the codebook or coding scheme. In qualitative content analysis the codebook is constructed and improved &quot;during&quot; coding, while in quantitative content analysis the codebook needs to be developed and pretested for reliability and validity &quot;before&quot; coding. The codebook includes detailed instructions for human coders plus clear definitions of the respective concepts or variables to be coded plus the assigned values.

== Computational tools ==

With the rise of common computing facilities like PCs, computer-based methods of analysis are growing in popularity. Answers to open ended questions, newspaper articles, political party manifestos, medical records or systematic observations in experiments can all be subject to systematic analysis of textual data.

By having contents of communication available in form of machine readable texts, the input is analyzed for frequencies and coded into categories for building up inferences.

Computer-assisted analysis can help with large, electronic data sets by cutting out time and eliminating the need for multiple human coders to establish inter-coder reliability. However, human coders can still be employed for content analysis, as they are often more able to pick out nuanced and latent meanings in text. A study found that human coders were able to evaluate a broader range and make inferences based on latent meanings.

==Reliability and Validity ==
Robert Weber notes: &quot;To make valid inferences from the text, it is important that the classification procedure be reliable in the sense of being consistent: Different people should code the same text in the same way&quot;. The validity, inter-coder reliability and intra-coder reliability are subject to intense methodological research efforts over long years.
Neuendorf suggests that when human coders are used in content analysis at least two independent coders should be used. Reliability of human coding is often measured using a statistical measure of &quot;inter-coder reliability&quot; or &quot;the amount of agreement or correspondence among two or more coders&quot;. Lacy and Riffe identify the measurement of inter-coder reliability as a strength of quantitative content analysis, arguing that, if content analysts do not measure inter-coder reliability, their data are no more reliable than the subjective impressions of a single reader.

According to today&#x27;s reporting standards, quantitative content analyses should be published with complete codebooks and for all variables or measures in the codebook the appropriate inter-coder or inter-rater reliability coefficients should be reported based on empirical pre-tests. Furthermore, the validity of all variables or measures in the codebook must be ensured. This can be achieved through the use of established measures that have proven their validity in earlier studies. Also, the content validity of the measures can be checked by experts from the field who scrutinize and then approve or correct coding instructions, definitions and examples in the codebook.

=== Kinds of text ===

There are five types of texts in content analysis:
# written text, such as books and papers 
# oral text, such as speech and theatrical performance
# iconic text, such as drawings, paintings, and icons
# audio-visual text, such as TV programs, movies, and videos
# hypertexts, which are texts found on the Internet

=== History ===
Content analysis is research using the categorization and classification of speech, written text, interviews, images, or other forms of communication. In its beginnings, using the first newspapers at the end of the 19th century, analysis was done manually by measuring the number of columns given a subject. The approach can also be traced back to a university student studying patterns in Shakespeare&#x27;s literature in 1893.

Over the years, content analysis has been applied to a variety of scopes. Hermeneutics and philology have long used content analysis to interpret sacred and profane texts and, in many cases, to attribute texts&#x27; authorship and authenticity.

In recent times, particularly with the advent of mass communication, content analysis has known an increasing use to deeply analyze and understand media content and media logic. 
The political scientist Harold Lasswell formulated the core questions of content analysis in its early-mid 20th-century mainstream version: &quot;Who says what, to whom, why, to what extent and with what effect?&quot;. The strong emphasis for a quantitative approach started up by Lasswell was finally carried out by another &quot;father&quot; of content analysis, Bernard Berelson, who proposed a definition of content analysis which, from this point of view, is emblematic: &quot;a research technique for the objective, systematic and quantitative description of the manifest content of communication&quot;.

Quantitative content analysis has enjoyed a renewed popularity in recent years thanks to technological advances, being fruitfully applied in mass and personal communication research. Content analysis of textual big data produced by new media, particularly social media and mobile devices has become popular. These approaches take a simplified view of language that ignores the complexity of semiosis, the process by which meaning is formed out of language. Quantitative content analysts have been criticized for limiting the scope of content analysis to simple counting, and for applying the measurement methodologies of the natural sciences without reflecting critically on their appropriateness to social science. Conversely, qualitative content analysts have been criticized for being insufficiently systematic and too impressionistic. Krippendorff argues that quantitative and qualitative approaches to content analysis tend to overlap, and that there can be no generalisable conclusion as to which approach is superior.

Content analysis can also be described as studying traces, which are documents from past times, and artifacts, which are non-linguistic documents. Texts are understood to be produced by communication processes in a broad sense of that phrase—often gaining mean through abduction.

=== Latent and manifest content ===
Manifest content is readily understandable at its face value. Its meaning is direct. Latent content is not as overt, and requires interpretation to uncover the meaning or implication.

==Uses==
Holsti groups fifteen uses of content analysis into three basic categories:
* make inferences about the antecedents of a communication
*describe and make inferences about characteristics of a communication
*make inferences about the effects of a communication.
He also places these uses into the context of the basic communication paradigm.

The following table shows fifteen uses of content analysis in terms of their general purpose, element of the communication paradigm to which they apply, and the general question they are intended to answer.

As a counterpoint, there are limits to the scope of use for the procedures that characterize content analysis. In particular, if access to the goal of analysis can be obtained by direct means without material interference, then direct measurement techniques yield better data. Thus, while content analysis attempts to quantifiably describe &quot;communications&quot; whose features are primarily categorical——limited usually to a nominal or ordinal scale——via selected conceptual units (the &quot;unitization&quot;) which are assigned values (the &quot;categorization&quot;) for &quot;enumeration&quot; while monitoring &quot;intercoder reliability&quot;, if instead the target quantity manifestly is already directly measurable——typically on an interval or ratio scale——especially a continuous physical quantity, then such targets usually are not listed among those needing the &quot;subjective&quot; selections and formulations of content analysis. For example (from mixed research and clinical application), as medical images &quot;communicate&quot; diagnostic features to physicians, neuroimaging&#x27;s stroke (infarct) volume scale called ASPECTS is &quot;unitized&quot; as 10 qualitatively delineated (unequal) brain regions in the middle cerebral artery territory, which it &quot;categorizes&quot; as being at least partly versus not at all infarcted in order to &quot;enumerate&quot; the latter, with published series often assessing &quot;intercoder reliability&quot; by Cohen&#x27;s kappa. The foregoing &quot;italicized operations&quot; impose the uncredited &quot;form&quot; of content analysis onto an estimation of infarct extent, which instead is easily enough and more accurately measured as a volume directly on the images. (&quot;Accuracy ... is the highest form of reliability.&quot;) The concomitant clinical assessment, however, by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) or the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), retains the necessary form of content analysis. Recognizing potential limits of content analysis across the contents of language and images alike, Klaus Krippendorff affirms that &quot;comprehen[sion] ... may ... not conform at all to the process of classification and/or counting by which most content analyses proceed,&quot; suggesting that content analysis might materially distort a message.

== Developing the initial coding scheme ==
The process of the initial coding scheme or approach to coding is contingent on the particular content analysis approach selected. Through a directed content analysis, the scholars draft a preliminary coding scheme from pre-existing theory or assumptions. While with the conventional content analysis approach, the initial coding scheme developed from the data.

=== Conventional process of coding ===
With either approach above, researchers may immerse themselves into the data to obtain an overall picture. A consistent and clear unit of coding is vital, with the choices ranging from a single word to several paragraphs and from texts to iconic symbols. Lastly, researchers construct the relationships between codes by sorting out them within specific categories or themes.

<doc id="473319" wikidata="Q1850904" url="?curid=473319" title="Opinion leadership">
<text>Opinion leadership is leadership by an active media user who interprets the meaning of media messages or content for lower-end media users. Typically opinion leaders are held in high esteem by those who accept their opinions. Opinion leadership comes from the theory of two-step flow of communication propounded by Paul Lazarsfeld and Elihu Katz. Significant developers of the opinion leader concept have been Robert K. Merton, C. Wright Mills and Bernard Berelson. This theory is one of several models that try to explain the diffusion of innovations, ideas, or commercial products.

Opinion leaders play an important role in information flow, because people tend to seek advice from others in the social environment. Information from the mass media does not directly flow to the target audiences, but through a mediation process, in which influential people digest the information and spread it to the public. Opinion leaders have certain characteristics that make them influential in the decision-making process and the behavior of the public. Through knowledge sharing, opinion leaders may help others do jobs better, facilitate personal development and improve personal recognition.

According to Yufu Kuwashima, an opinion leader’s power and influence come from the network their followers create. Dedicated supporters reinforce the leader’s messaging to other media consumers, strengthening their influence. If one were to remove the opinion leader there would still be a network of connected users that could share ideas with one another. An opinion leader has constructed this network, but the ability to influence others lies in the network itself. In order to effectively influence the opinion of followers, they must find the leader to be above them.

==Types==
Merton distinguishes two types of opinion leadership: monomorphic and polymorphic. Typically, opinion leadership is viewed as a monomorphic, domain-specific measure of individual differences, that is, a person that is an opinion leader in one field may be a follower in another field. An example of a monomorphic opinion leader in the field of computer technology, might be a neighborhood computer service technician. The technician has access to far more information on this topic than the average consumer and has the requisite background to understand the information, though the same person might be a follower at another field (for example sports) and ask others for advice. In contrast, polymorphic opinion leaders are able to influence others in a broad range of domains. Variants of polymorphic opinion leadership include market mavenism, personality strength and generalized opinion leadership. So far, there is little consensus as to the degree these concepts operationalize the same or simply related constructs.

==Characteristics==
In his article &quot;The Two Step Flow of Communication&quot;, Elihu Katz, found opinion leaders to have more influence on people&#x27;s opinions, actions, and behaviors than the media. Opinion leaders are seen to have more influence than the media for a number of reasons. Opinion leaders are seen as trustworthy and non-purposive. People do not feel they are being tricked into thinking a certain way about something if they get information from someone they know. However, the media can be seen as forcing a concept on the public and therefore will be less influential. While the media can act as a reinforcing agent, opinion leaders have a more changing or determining role in an individual&#x27;s opinion or action.

This does not mean that opinion leaders can be always easily used by external agents to promote what they want to promote. Influential individuals might not be willing to change their behavior and may even lose their opinion leader status, if they do.

==Factors for leadership==
In his article, Elihu Katz answers the question, &quot;Who is an opinion leader?&quot; One or more of these factors make noteworthy opinion leaders:
# expression of values;
# professional competence;
# nature of their social network.

There are personal characteristics that make up an opinion leader. Opinion leaders are individuals who obtain more media coverage than others and are especially educated on a certain issue. Opinion leaders that utilize social media are more likely to be introverted. Introverts don&#x27;t receive as much interpersonal interaction offline. They can compensate by creating a controllable network of followers to interact with and gain recognition from in a social context. Opinion leaders seek the acceptance of others and are especially motivated to enhance their social status. Public individualism is the idea that an individual will act different from others because they are different. Kenny K. Chan and Shekhar Misra found opinion leaders possess this trait. “The individuation process and this personal-influence process both involve a reciprocal interchange which involve a willingness to stand out in a group situation.&quot; An opinion leader’s willingness to stand out is what sets them apart from their followers. In the jargon of public relations, they are called thought leaders. Research has also found that opinion leaders tend to be boundary spanners.

In relation to their followers, opinion leaders maintain a particular degree of separation in terms of socio-economic status. According to Gershon Feder and Sara Savastano, it is not effective for leaders to be a part of the same socio-economic status as followers. “opinion leaders who are superior to followers, but not excessively so, are more effective in transmitting knowledge.” Meanwhile the leader must be close enough in standing to relate to the followers they want to influence.

==Examples==
In a strategic attempt to engage the public in environmental issues and his nonprofit, The Climate Project, Al Gore used the concept of opinion leaders. Gore found opinion leaders by recruiting individuals who were educated on environmental issues and saw themselves as influential in their community and amongst their friends and family. From there, he trained the opinion leaders on the information he wanted them to spread and enabled them to influence their communities. By using opinion leaders, Gore was able to educate and influence many Americans to take notice of climate change and change their actions.

Matthew Nisbet describes the use of opinion leaders as intermediaries between scientists and the public as a way to reach the public via trained individuals who are more closely engaged with their communities, such as &quot;teachers, business leaders, attorneys, policymakers, neighborhood leaders, students, and media professionals.&quot; Examples of initiatives that take this approach include science and engineering ambassadors sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences, and science booster clubs coordinated by the National Center for Science Education.

<doc id="473321" wikidata="Q540742" url="?curid=473321" title="Spiral of silence">
<text>The spiral of silence theory is a political science and mass communication theory which states that an individual&#x27;s perception of the distribution of public opinion influences that individual&#x27;s willingness to express their own opinions. Also known as the theory of public opinion, the spiral of silence theory claims individuals will be more confident and outward with their opinion when they notice that their personal opinion is shared throughout a group. But if the individual notices that their opinion is unpopular with the group, they will be more inclined to be reserved and remain silent. In other words, from the individual&#x27;s perspective, &quot;not isolating themself is more important than their own judgement&quot;, meaning their perception of how others in the group perceive them is more important to themself than the need for their opinion to be heard.

According to Glynn (1995), &quot;the major components of the spiral of silence include (1) an issue of public interest; (2) divisiveness on the issue; (3) a quasi-statistical sense that helps an individual perceive the climate of opinion as well as estimate the majority and minority opinion; (4) &#x27;fear of isolation&#x27; from social interaction &quot;(though, whether this is a causal factor in the willingness to speak out is contested)&quot;; (5) an individual&#x27;s belief that a minority (or &#x27;different&#x27;) opinion isolates oneself from others; and (6) a &#x27;hardcore&#x27; group of people whose opinions are unaffected by others&#x27; opinions.&quot;

The theory is not without criticism, some arguing that its widely understood definition and parameters have not been updated to reflect the behavior of 21st century society. Others point out that there is no room within the theory to account for variables of influence other than social isolation.

==Background==
In 1974, Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann, a German political scientist, created the model called &quot;Spiral of Silence&quot;. She believed that an &quot;individuals willingness to express his or her opinion was a function of how he or she perceived public opinion.&quot; In 1974, Neumann and her husband founded the &quot;Public Opinion Organization&quot; in Germany. She was also the President of the &quot;World Association for Public Opinion Research&quot; from 1978 to 1980.

Noelle-Neumann evolved the spiral of silence theory from research on the 1965 West German federal election. The research, according to Noelle-Neumann, &quot;measured a lot more than we understood.&quot; The two major parties were locked in a dead heat from December until September, with a series of questions of public perception of the election winner was showing steady, independent movement. During the final days of the election, 3 to 4% of the voters shifted in the direction of the public&#x27;s perception of the winner. A similar shift happened in the 1972 election, which began the development of the spiral of silence as a theory of public opinion.

According to Shelly Neill, &quot;Introduced in 1974, the Spiral of Silence Theory [...] explores hypotheses to determine why some groups remain silent while others are more vocal in forums of public disclosure.&quot; The spiral of silence theory suggests that &quot;people who have believed that they hold a minority viewpoint on a public issue will remain in the background where their communication will be restrained; those who believe that they hold a majority viewpoint will be more encouraged to speak.&quot; The spiral of silence theory arose from a combination of high public uncertainty about a topic with an increase in the flow of communication.

The theory explains the formation of social norms at both the micro and macro level. &quot;As a micro-theory, the spiral of silence examines opinion expression, controlling for people&#x27;s predispositions – such as fear of isolation, and also demographic variables that have been shown to influence people&#x27;s willingness to publicly express opinions on issues, such as agricultural biotechnology.&quot; This micro effect is seen in experiments such as the Asch conformity experiments, conducted as early as the 1950s, in which a group of students are asked to compare the length of lines. All but one student are coached ahead of time on what answers to give and how to behave. When the coached subjects gave unanimously incorrect answers, the dissenter tended to agree with the majority, at times even when the difference between the lines was so egregious as seven inches. On the &quot;macro&quot; level, the spiral of silence occurs if more and more members of the perceived minority fall silent. This is when public perceptions of the opinion climate begin to shift. &quot;In other words, a person&#x27;s individual reluctance to express his or her opinion, simply based on perceptions of what everyone else thinks, has important implications at the social level.&quot; As one opinion gains interest, the amount of exposure it receives increases, leading the public to believe it is the majority. The perceived minority then faces the threat and fear of isolation from society unless they conform. As the opinion gains momentum, the perceived minority falls deeper into their silence. This continues until the perceived minority no longer speaks out against it, either by presenting an image of agreement or actually conforming, and the opinion of the perceived majority ultimately becomes a social norm. Large scale effects of the spiral of silence can be seen when examining the growth of the dominant opinion within a countries political climate or other such issues.

The spiral of silence has continued to be observed and studied since then. In today&#x27;s world, technology can play a key part in the spiral of silence, something that could not have been predicted at the time of its inception. For example, survey data showed that during the 2016 US presidential election, opinion congruency for democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in society at large and for republican candidate Donald Trump on Facebook had indirect associations for willingness to present one&#x27;s opinion both offline and online.

===Spiral model===
The spiral model is used to visually represent the theory. It claims that an individual is more likely to go down the spiral if his or her opinion does not conform with the perceived majority opinion. The following steps summarize how the process works:
#The model begins with individuals&#x27; inherent desire to blend with society. The fear of social isolation is necessary for the spiral to occur.
#Individuals who notice that their personal opinion is spreading will voice this opinion confidently in public. On the other hand, individuals who notice that their opinions are losing ground will be inclined to adopt a more reserved attitude when expressing their opinions in public.
#Representatives of the spreading opinion talk quite a lot while the representatives of the second opinion remain silent. An opinion that is being reinforced in this way appears stronger than it is, while a suppressed opinion will seem weaker than it is.
#The result is a spiral process which prompts other individuals to perceive the changes in opinion and follow suit until one opinion becomes established as the prevailing attitude. Meanwhile, the other opinion is pushed back and rejected by most. The end of the spiral refers to the number of people who are not publicly expressing their opinions, due to the fear of isolation.

In summary, the spiral model is a process of formation, change, and reinforcement of public opinion. The tendency of the one to speak up and the other to be silent begins a spiraling process which increasingly establishes one opinion as the dominant one.

Furthermore, Noelle-Neumann describes the spiral of silence as a dynamic process, in which predictions about public opinion become fact as mass media&#x27;s coverage of the majority opinion becomes the status quo, and the minority becomes less likely to speak out.

=== Relationship with other kinds of social influence ===
The basic ideas for the spiral of silence are not unique and are closely related to theories on conformity. In 1987, Kerr, MacCoun, Hansen and Hymes introduced the idea of the &quot;momentum effect&quot;. The momentum effect states that if some members of a group move toward a particular opinion, others will follow. Others have described similar &quot;gain-loss effect&quot; (Aronson &amp; Linder, 1965), and &quot;bandwagon effect&quot; (Myers &amp; Lamm, 1976). Experiments also show how the spiral of silence and the bandwagon effect jointly undermine minority positions when pre-election polls are shown to voters.

==Epistemology==

=== Public ===
Scholars have misguided interpretations of &quot;public opinion&quot;, confusing it with government and therefore limiting the understanding of the term as it relates to the theory. Noelle-Neumann clarifies this by creating three distinct meanings of &quot;public.&quot; First, is the legal term used to define &quot;public land&quot; or &quot;public spaces.&quot; Second concerns the issues of people as seen in journalism. Finally, public as in &quot;public eye&quot; is used in social psychology and refers to the way people think outwardly about their relationships. Public, in this sense, could be characterized as social psychology. This is the meaning intended to emphasize how subjects feel in social settings during conducted research.

Scholars have marveled in amazement at the power public opinion has in making regulations, norms, and moral rules triumph over the individual self without ever troubling legislators, governments, or courts for assistance.

===Opinion===
&quot;Common Opinion&quot; is how the Scottish social philosopher David Hume referred to public opinion in his 1739 published work &quot;A Treatise of Human Nature&quot;. Agreement and a sense of the common are what lay behind the English and French &quot;opinion.&quot; In researching the term opinion (&quot;Meinung&quot; in German) researchers were led back to Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;. In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;, a quote from Socrates concluded that opinion takes the middle position. Immanuel Kant considered the opinion to be an &quot;insufficient judgment, subjectively as well as objectively.&quot; How valuable opinion may be was left out; however, the fact that it is suggested to be unified agreement of a population or segment of the population, was still considered.

===Public opinion===
The term public opinion first emerged in France during the eighteenth century. The definition of public opinion has been debated over time. There has not been much progress in locking in one classification of the phrase &quot;public opinion,&quot; however Hermann Oncken, a German historian, stated Whoever desires to grasp and define the concept of public opinion will recognize quickly that he is dealing with a Proteus, a being that appears simultaneously in a thousand guises, both visible and as a phantom, impotent and surprisingly efficacious, which presents itself in innumerable transformations and is forever slipping through our fingers just as we believe we have a firm grip on it... That which floats and flows cannot be understood by being locked up in a formula... After all, when asked, everyone knows exactly what public opinion means. It was said to be a &quot;fiction that belonged in a museum of the history of ideas; it could only be of historical interest.&quot;

In contradiction to that quote, the term public opinion never fell out of use. During the early 1970s, Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann was creating the theory of the spiral of silence. She was attempting to explain why Germans who disagreed with Hitler and the Nazis remained silent until after his regime ended. Behavior like that has come to be known as the spiral of silence theory. Noelle-Neumann began to question if she was indeed getting a handle on what public opinion actually was. &quot;The spiral of silence might be one of the forms in which public opinion appeared; it might be a process through which a new, youthful public opinion develops or whereby the transformed meaning of an old opinion spreads.&quot;

The American sociologist Edward Ross described public opinion in 1898 using the word &quot;cheap&quot;. &quot;The equation of &#x27;public opinion&#x27; with &#x27;ruling opinion&#x27; runs like a common thread through its many definitions. This speaks to the fact that something clinging to public opinion sets up conditions that move individuals to act, even against their own will.&quot;

Other scholars point out that the emergence of the public opinion depends on an open public discourse rather than &quot;on the discipline imposed by an apparent majority dominant enough to intimidate but whose views may or may not support actions that are in the common interest.&quot; They have also considered whose opinion establishes public opinion, assumed to be persons of a community who are ready to express themselves responsibly about questions of public relevance. Scholars have also looked into the forms of public opinion, said to be those that are openly expressed and accessible; opinions that are made public, especially in the mass media. Controversy surrounding this term spiraled around both words combining to form the phrase.

Neumann (1955) suggests two concepts on public opinion:

Public Opinion as Rationality: The public opinion or &quot;dominant view&quot; comes after conscious rational public discussion. Childs (1965) and Wilson (1933) believe that &quot;the rational model is based on the notion of an enlightened, rational public that is willing to and capable of participating in political processes.&quot; In all, it is political and necessary for generating social change.

Public Opinion as Social Control: This is at the root of the spiral of silence theory. It means that &quot;opinions that can be expressed without risking sanctions or social isolation, or opinions that have to be expressed in order to avoid isolation (Noelle-Neumann 1983). Social systems require cohesion. To achieve this, individuals are threatened with social isolation.

== In mass media contexts ==

===Media and public opinion===
Mass media&#x27;s effects on both public opinion and the perception of the public opinion are central to the spiral of silence theory. One of the earliest works that called attention to the relationship between media and the formation of public opinion was Walter Lippmann&#x27;s book &quot;Public Opinion&quot;, published in 1922. Ideas of Lippmann regarding the effects of media influenced the emergence of the spiral of silence theory. As she is building the spiral theory, Noelle-Neumann states &quot;the reader can only complete and explain the world by making use of a consciousness which in large measure has been created by the mass media.&quot;

Agenda-setting theory is another work that Noelle-Neumann builds on as she is characterizing media&#x27;s effect on the public opinion. Agenda-setting theory describes the relationship between media and public opinion by asserting that the public importance of an issue depends on its salience in the media. Along with setting the agenda, the media further determine the salient issues through a constant battle with other events attempting to gain place in the agenda. The media battle with these news alternatives by creating &quot;pseudo-crises&quot; and &quot;pseudo-novelties.&quot;

Media&#x27;s characteristics as a communication tool further affect people&#x27;s perception of their own ideas in regard to the public opinion. According to Noelle-Neumann, the media are a &quot;one-sided, indirect, public form of communication, contrasting threefold with the most natural form of human communication, the conversation.&quot; When an issue hits the media and proves salient, a dominant point of view usually emerges. These characteristics of the media in particular further overwhelm one&#x27;s individual ideas.

While some media communication theories assume a passive audience, such as the Hypodermic Needle model, the spiral model assumes an active audience &quot;who consumes media products in the context of their personal and social goals.&quot; Knowledge &quot;gained from the mass media may offer ammunition for people to express their opinions and offer a rationale for their own stance.&quot; Ho et al. point out that &quot;among individuals who paid high amount of media attention, those who have a low fear of isolation were significantly more likely to offer a rationale for their own opinion than were those who have a high fear of isolation.&quot;

Noelle-Neuman regards media as central to the formulation of the Spiral of Silence Theory, whereas some scholars argue whether the dominant idea in one&#x27;s social environment overwhelms the dominant idea that media propose as the perceived social norm. Some empirical research align with this perspective; suggesting that the &quot;micro-climate&quot; of an individual overwhelms the effects of the media. Other articles further suggest that talking with others is the primary way of understanding the opinion climate.

===Social media===
Current literature suggests that the spiral model can be applied to the social media context. Researchers, found that social media actually weakens this theory. They contest that the spiral of silence suggests that the minority are uncomfortable expressing their opinions because of the fear of isolation, but, &quot;the vocal minority are comfortable expressing unpopular views, questioning the explanatory power of this popular theory in the online context.&quot;

However, in another study, Gearhart and Zhang examine whether or not the use of social media will increase people&#x27;s motivation to express their opinions about political issues. The results suggest that social media users &quot;who have received a strong negative reaction to their politically related posts are likely to censor themselves, exemplifying the spiral of silence effect&quot;. Another study found that the fear of isolation causes people to not want to share their opinion on social media in the first place. Similar to the Gearhart and Zhang study, results from this study showed that people are more likely to self-censor information on social media by not posting some things that are political, choosing what and what not to follow or like, etc.

Another research confirms the positive relationship between speaking out and issue importance on the social media context as well: individuals who view gay bullying as a significant social issue are more likely to comment on Facebook. 

Artificially generated social engagement is also worth noting. As social media becomes more and more important in our daily lives, deceptive social have been successfully applied for manipulating online conversations and opinions. Social bots are social media accounts managed by computer algorithms. They can automatically generate content and interact with human users, often impersonating or imitating humans. Current research shows that &quot;social bots&quot; are being used on a large scale to control the opinion climate to influence public opinion on social media. In some cases only a small number of social bots can easily direct public opinion on social media and trigger a spiral of silence model. For example, scholars find out that social bots can affect political discussion around the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the 2017 French presidential election.
==Assumptions==
=== Perception ===
The Spiral of Silence Theory rests on the assumption that individuals will scan their environment to assess the climate to possibly find the dominant point of view. Perception matters because these opinions influence an individual&#x27;s behavior and attitudes. Sherif (1967) believes individuals use frames of reference based on past experience to inform their perception -- &quot;social environment as a frame of reference for interpreting new information has important implications for public opinion research.&quot; It is also worth mentioning that the assessment of one&#x27;s social environment may not always correlate with reality.

====Quasi-statistical organ====
Noelle-Neumann attributed this ability of assessing opinion climate on an issue to the so-called &quot;quasi-statistical organ&quot;, which refers to how individuals unconsciously assess the distribution of viewpoints and the chances that certain viewpoints will succeed over others. People assume they can sense and figure out what others are thinking.

====Pluralistic ignorance====
Pluralistic ignorance may occur in some cases in which the minority opinion is incorrectly accepted as the norm. Group members may be privately rejecting a norm, but may falsely assume that other group members accept it. This phenomenon, also known as a collective illusions, is when people in a group think everyone else has a different opinion from theirs and go along with the norm.

===Fear of isolation===
The spiral of silence can lead to a social group or society isolating or excluding members due to the members&#x27; opinions. This stipulates that individuals have a fear of isolation. This fear of isolation consequently leads to remaining silent instead of voicing opinions.

The fear of isolation is the &quot;engine that drives the spiral of silence&quot;. Essentially, people fear becoming social isolates and thus take measures to avoid such a consequence, as demonstrated by psychologist Solomon Asch in the Asch conformity experiments. People feel more comfortable agreeing with the dominant opinions instead of expressing their own ideas.

An underlying idea of the spiral of silence theory is that public opinion acts as a form of social control. According to Noelle-Neumann&#x27;s definition this key concept describes &quot;opinions on controversial issues that one can express in public without isolating oneself&quot;. This assumption supposed that public opinion is governed by norms and conventions, the violation of which will lead to sanctions against those individuals. Going off of this assumption that going against public opinion will lead to social sanctions, Noelle-Neumann assumes that human beings have an inherent fear of isolation and will adapt their behavior so that they will not be isolated from others. This “fear of isolation” is so strong that people will not express opinions if they assume that these opinions differ from public opinion.

== How does the fear of isolation function? ==
This fear of social isolation is a central concept in Noelle-Neumann&#x27;s theory but throughout different studies on the theory it has been conceptualized in many different ways. Some researchers have considered fear of social isolation to be transitory and triggered by the exposure to a situation in which an individual is expected to express an opinion. In this conceptualization an individual&#x27;s perception of the opinion climate in a specific situation would trigger the fear of isolation in that moment.

Other researchers have argued that instead of a situation-specific reaction, fear of social isolation can be viewed as individual characteristic that varies between people and leads individuals to continuously monitor their environment for cues about the opinion climate. While there are individuals who generally do not suffer from a fear of isolation (what Noelle-Neumann referred to as Hardcores) others are constantly aware of their social environment and faced with a constant fear of isolation. Individuals who bear this characteristic of fear of social isolation and at the same time perceive their opinion to be incongruent with the majority opinion climate are less likely to be willing to voice their opinion. In this line of spiral of silence research fear of social isolation is a key concept in formation of public opinion, however research has often assumed this conceptualization as a fact without empirical proof or been inconsistent in the empirical measurement of this phenomenon.

Recent research has been able to capture the concept of fear of social isolation in a more reliable and consistent way. One example is research conducted by in which the researchers used an individual differences approach based on individual&#x27;s character traits and measured individual&#x27;s fear of social isolation using psychometric properties. , as well as other researchers, considers fear of social isolation to be a subsequent reaction to encountering a perceived hostile opinion climate which in turn leads the individual to not voice their own opinions and therefore sets in motion the spiral of silence.

Although many accept fear of isolation to be the motivation behind the theory, arguments have been made for other causal factors. For example, Lasorsa proposed it may be less a fear of isolation fueling the spiral, and more about political interest (in the case of political debate) and self-efficacy. From a more positive standpoint, Taylor suggested the benefits of opinion expression, whether that opinion was common or not, to be the motivation. When studying the willingness to discuss an issue so divisive as abortion, Salmon and Neuwirth found only &quot;mixed supportive evidence&quot; for fear of isolation, and instead found that knowledge and personal concern of the issue played important roles. More examples follow at the end of the article.

=== Responses to disputed and undisputed opinions ===
Where opinions are relatively definite and static – customs, for example – one has to express or act according to this opinion in public or run the risk of becoming isolated. In contrast, where opinions are in flux, or disputed, the individual will try to find out which opinion he can express without becoming isolated.

==Vocal minority and hardcore==
The theory explains a &quot;vocal minority&quot; (the complement of the &quot;silent majority&quot;) by stating that people who are highly educated, or who have greater affluence, and the few other cavalier individuals who do not fear isolation (if that is accepted to be the causal factor), are likely to speak out regardless of public opinion. It further states that this minority is a necessary factor of change while the compliant majority is a necessary factor of stability, with both being a product of evolution. There is a vocal minority, which remains at the top of the spiral in defiance of threats of isolation.

This theory calls these vocal minorities the hardcore nonconformist or the avant-garde. Hardcore nonconformists are &quot;people who have already been rejected for their beliefs and have nothing to lose by speaking out.&quot; The hardcore has the ability to reconfigure majority opinion, while the avant-garde are &quot;the intellectuals, artists, and reformers in the isolated minority who speak out because they are convinced they are ahead of the times.&quot;

Hardcore is best understood when the majority voices loses power in public opinion due to a lack of alternatives. People&#x27;s opinions may affect narrow-minded views as a result of the hard core&#x27;s efforts to educate the public. Hardcore may be instrumental in changing public opinion even though it is frequently engaged in irrational acts to prove their point.

==Real world application of the theory==
The spiral of silence has brought insight regarding diverse topics, ranging from speaking about popular culture phenomena to smoking. Considering that the spiral of silence is more likely to occur in controversial issues and issues with a moral component, many scholars have applied the theory to controversial topics, such as abortion, affirmative action, capital punishment, mandatory COVID-19 vaccines and masking.

===Social capital===
The spiral of silence theory can be also applied to social capital context. Recent studies see social capital as &quot;a variable that enables citizens to develop norms of trust and reciprocity, which are necessary for successful engagement in collective activities&quot;. One study examines three individual-level indicators of social capital: civic engagement, trust and neighborliness, and the relationship between these indicators and people&#x27;s willingness to express their opinions and their perception of support for one&#x27;s opinions. The results suggest that civic engagement has a direct effect on people&#x27;s willingness to express their opinions and neighborliness and trust had direct positive effects on people&#x27;s perception of support for one&#x27;s opinions. Also, the study shows that &quot;only a direct (but not indirect) effect of civic engagement on opinion expression further highlights a potential difference between bonding and bridging social capital&quot;.

===Cross-cultural studies===
Existing literature prior to the spiral of silence theory suggest a relationship between social conformity and culture, motivating communication scholars to conduct cross-cultural analysis of the theory. Scholars in the field of psychology in particular previously addressed the cultural variance involved in the conformity to the majority opinion. More recent studies confirm the link between conformity and culture: a meta-analysis regarding Asch conformity experiments, for example, suggest that collectivist cultures are more likely to exhibit conformity than the individualistic cultures.

====The United States and Taiwan====
&quot;A Cross-Cultural Test of the Spiral of Silence&quot; by Huiping Huang analyzes the results of a telephone survey done in Taiwan and the United States. The hypotheses tested were the beliefs that the United States is an &quot;individualistic&quot; society, while Taiwan is a &quot;collectivist&quot; society. This suggested that the spiral of silence is less likely to be activated in the United States, because individuals are more likely to put emphasis on their personal goals. They put the &quot;I&quot; identity over the &quot;we&quot; identity, and strive for personal success. Therefore, it was hypothesized that they would be more likely to speak out, regardless of if they are in the minority. On the other hand, it was predicted that individuals in Taiwan put more emphasis on the collective goal, so they would conform to the majority influence in hopes of avoiding tension and conflict. The study also tested the effect of motives, including self-efficacy and self-assurance.

Telephone surveys were conducted; the citizens of the United States were questioned in regard to American involvement in Somalia, and the citizens of Taiwan about the possibility of a direct presidential election. Both issues focused on politics and human rights, and were therefore comparable. Respondents were asked to choose &quot;favor&quot;, &quot;neutral&quot; or &quot;oppose&quot; in regard to the categories of themselves, family and friends, the media, society, and society in the future about the given issue. Measurements were also taken regarding the individualism and collectivism constructs, and the &quot;motives of not expressing opinion&quot; based on a 1–10 and 1–5 scale respectively, in approval of given statements.

Results showed support for the original hypothesis. Overall, Americans were more likely to speak out than Taiwanese. Being incongruous with the majority lessened the motivation of the Taiwanese to speak out (and they had a higher collectivist score), but had little effect on the Americans. In Taiwan, future support and belief of society played a large role in likeliness to voice an opinion, and support that the activation of the spiral of silence is in effect. In the United States, it was hypothesized that because they were more individualistic, they would be more likely to speak out if in the minority, or incongruous group. However, this was not true, but Huang suggests that perhaps the issue chosen was not directly prevalent, and therefore, they found it &quot;unnecessary to voice their objections to the majority opinion.&quot; Lack of self-efficacy led to lack of speaking out in both countries.

====Basque nationalism====
&quot;Basque Nationalism and the Spiral of Silence&quot; is an article by Spencer and Croucher that analyzes the public perception of ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, a militant separatist group) in Spain and France. This study was conducted in a similar way as above, with Basque individuals from Spain and France being questioned about their support of ETA. They were asked questions such as &quot;How likely would you be to enter into a conversation with a stranger on a train about ETA?&quot; Taken into consideration were the cultural differences of the two different regions in which ETA existed.

The results supported the theory of the spiral of silence. While there was a highly unfavorable opinion of the group, there was a lack of an outcry to stop it. Individuals claimed that they were more likely to voice their opinions to non-Basques, suggesting that they have a &quot;fear of isolation&quot; in regard to fellow Basques. Furthermore, the Spanish individuals questioned were more likely to be silent because of their greater proximity to the violent acts.

===Perceptions in the classroom===
One study by Henson and Denker &quot;investigates perceptions of silencing behaviors, political affiliation, and political differences as correlates to perceptions of the university classroom climates and communication behaviors.&quot; They looked at whether students&#x27; view of the classroom changes whether they perceive the instructor and other classmates with a different political affiliation, with the instructor and other classmates communicating using silencing behaviors. The article stated that little has been investigated into student-teacher interactions in the classroom, and how the students are influenced. The goal of the article was to &quot;determine how political ideas are expressed in the university classrooms, and thus, assess the influence of classroom communication on the perceptions of political tolerance.&quot;

The article claimed that university classrooms are an adequate place to scrutinize the spiral of silence theory because it is a place that has interpersonal, cultural, media, and political communication. Henson and Denker said, &quot;Because classroom interactions and societal discourse are mutually influential, instructors and students bring their own biases and cultural perspectives into the classroom.&quot;

The study researched whether there was a correlation between students&#x27; perception that they were being politically silenced and their perceived differences in student-instructor political affiliation. The study also questioned whether there was any connection between the perceived climate and the similarity of the student and instructor on their political affiliations. The researchers used participants from a Midwestern university&#x27;s communication courses. The students answered a survey over their perceptions of political silencing, classroom climate, and the climate created by the instructor. The results of this research found that there is a positive relationship of the perceived similarities in a political party and ideological differences of the student and instructor to perceived greater political silencing.

===In computer-mediated communication===
While the studies regarding the spiral of silence theory focused on face-to-face interaction before 2000, the theory was later applied to a computer-mediated communication environment. The first study in this context analyzed communication behaviors in online chat rooms regarding the issue of abortion, and revealed that minority opinion holders were more likely to speak out, whereas their comments remained neutral. Another study focused on the Korean bulletin board postings regarding the national election, and found a relationship between online postings and the presentation of candidates in the mainstream media. The third study focuses on the online review system, suggesting that the fear of isolation tend to reduce the willingness of members to voice neutral and negative reviews. The spiral of silence theory is extended &quot;into the context of non-anonymous multichannel communication platforms&quot; and &quot;the need to consider the role of communicative affordances in online opinion expression&quot; is also addressed.

==The rising influence of the internet and social media==
===Isolating the factors that remove isolation===
The concept of isolation has a variety of definitions, dependent upon the circumstances it is investigated in. In one instance the problem of isolation has been defined as social withdrawal, defined as low relative frequencies of peer interaction. Other researchers have defined isolation as low levels of peer acceptance or high levels of peer rejection. Research that considers isolation with regard to the Internet either focuses on how the Internet makes individuals more isolated from society by cutting off their contact from live human beings or how the Internet decreases social isolation of people by allowing them to expand their social networks and giving them more means to stay in touch with friends and family. Since the development of the Internet, and in particular the World Wide Web, a wide variety of groups have come into existence, including Web and Internet Relay Chat (IRC), newsgroups, multiuser dimensions (MUDs), and, more recently, commercial virtual communities. The theories and hypotheses about how Internet-based groups impact individuals are numerous and wide-ranging. Some researchers view these fast growing virtual chat cliques, online games, or computer-based marketplaces as a new opportunity, particularly for stigmatized people, to take a more active part in social life.

Traditionally, social isolation has been presented as a one-dimensional construct organized around the notion of a person&#x27;s position outside the peer group and refers to isolation from the group as a result of being excluded from the group by peers. From children to adults, literature shows that people understand the concept of isolation and fear the repercussions of being isolated from groups of which they are a member. Fearing isolation, people did not feel free to speak up if they feel they hold dissenting views, which means people restrict themselves to having conversation with like-minded individuals, or have no conversation whatsoever. Witschge further explained, &quot;Whether it is fear of harming others, or fear to get harmed oneself, there are factors that inhibit people from speaking freely, and which thus results in a non-ideal type of discussion, as it hinders diversity and equality of participants and viewpoints to arise fully.&quot;

The medium of the Internet has the power to free people from the fear of social isolation, and in doing so, shuts down the spiral of silence. One article demonstrates that social media can weaken the fear of isolation. The research shows that the vocal minority who hold racist viewpoints are willing to express unpopular views on Facebook. The Internet allows people to find a place where they can find groups of people with like mindsets and similar points of view. Van Alstyne and Brynjolfsson stated that &quot;Internet users can seek out interactions with like-minded individuals who have similar values, and thus become less likely to trust important decisions to people whose values differ from their own.&quot; The features of the Internet could not only bring about more people to deliberate by freeing people of psychological barriers, but also bring new possibilities in that it &quot;makes manageable large-scale, many-to-many discussion and deliberation.&quot; Unlike traditional media that limit participation, the Internet brings the characteristics of empowerment, enormous scales of available information, specific audiences can be targeted effectively and people can be brought together through the medium.

===Online versus offline===
The Internet is a place where many reference and social groups are available with similar views. It has become a place where it appears that people have less of a fear of isolation. One research article examined individuals&#x27; willingness to speak their opinion online and offline. Through survey results from 305 participants, a comparison and contrast of online and offline spiral of silence behaviors was determined. Liu and Fahmy stated that &quot;it is easy to quit from an online discussion without the pressure of complying with the majority group.&quot; This is not to say that a spiral of silence does not occur in an online environment. People are still less likely to speak out, even in an online setting, when there is a dominant opinion that differs from their own. But people in the online environment will speak up if someone has a reference group that speaks up for them.

Online, the presence of one person who encourages a minority point of view can put an end to a spiral of silence. Studies of the spiral of silence in online behavior have not acknowledged that a person may be more likely to speak out against dominant views offline as well. The person might have characteristics that make them comfortable speaking out against dominant views offline, which make them just as comfortable speaking out in an online setting.

Although research suggests that people will disclose their opinions more often in an online setting, silencing of views can still occur. One study indicates that people on Facebook are less willing to discuss the Snowden and NSA stories than an offline situation such as a family dinner or public meeting. Another research article examined the influence of different opinion climates in online forums (opinion congruence with the majority of forum participants vs. website source) and found personal opinion congruence was more influential than the online site in which the forum is situated in. Nekmat and Gonzenbach said it might be worth researching whether the factors in these studies or other factors cause people to be more comfortable when it comes to speaking their mind while online.

===Heterogeneity and anonymity===
The nature of the Internet facilitates not only the participation of more people, but also a more heterogeneous group of people. Page stated, &quot;The onward rush of electronic communications technology will presumably increase the diversity of available ideas and the speed and ease with which they fly about and compete with each other.&quot; The reason people engage in deliberations is because of their differences, and the Internet allows differences to be easily found. The Internet seems the perfect place to find different views of a very diverse group of people who are at the same time open to such difference and disagreement needed for deliberation. Noelle-Neumann&#x27;s initial idea of cowering and muted citizens is difficult to reconcile with empirical studies documenting uninhibited discussion in computer-mediated contexts such as chat rooms and newsgroups.

The Internet provides an anonymous setting, and it can be argued that in an anonymous setting, fears of isolation and humiliation would be reduced. Wallace recognized that when people believe their actions cannot be attributed to them personally, they tend to become less inhibited by social conventions and restraints. This can be very positive, particularly when people are offered the opportunity to discuss difficult personal issues under conditions in which they feel safer.

The groups&#x27; ability to taunt an individual is lessened on the Internet, thus reducing the tendency to conform. Wallace goes on to summarize a number of empirical studies that do find that dissenters feel more liberated to express their views online than offline, which might result from the fact that the person in the minority would not have to endure taunts or ridicule from people that are making up the majority, or be made to feel uncomfortable for having a different opinion. Stromer-Galley considered that &quot;an absence of non-verbal cues, which leads to a lowered sense of social presence, and a heightened sense of anonymity&quot; frees people from the psychological barriers that keep them from engaging in a face-to-face deliberation.

The crux of the spiral of silence is that people believe consciously or subconsciously that the expression of unpopular opinions will lead to negative repercussions. These beliefs may not exist on the Internet for several reasons. First, embarrassment and humiliation depends on the physical presence of others. In computer-mediated communication, physical isolation often already exists and poses no further threat. Second, a great deal of normative influence is communicated through nonverbal cues, such as eye contact and gestures, but computer-mediated communication typically precludes many of these cues. Third, Kiesler, Siegel, and McQuire observe that nonverbal social context cues convey formality and status inequality in face-to-face communication. When these cues are removed, the importance of social status as a source of influence recedes. Group hierarchies that develop in face-to-face interaction emerge less clearly in a mediated environment. The form and consequences of conformity influence should undergo significant changes given the interposition of a medium that reduces the social presence of participants. Social presence is defined as the degree of salience of the other person in the interaction or the degree to which the medium conveys some of the person&#x27;s presence.

===Equality===
An important issue in obtaining heterogeneity in conversation is equal access for all the participants and equal opportunities to influence in the discussion. When people believe they are ignorant about a topic, incapable to participate in a discussion or not equal to their peers, they tend to not even become involved in a deliberation. When people do decide to participate, their participation might be overruled by dominant others, or their contribution might be valued less or more, depending on their status. Dahlberg praises the Internet for its possibility to liberate people from the social hierarchies and power relations that exist offline: &quot;The &#x27;blindness&#x27; of cyberspace to bodily identity... [is supposed to allow] people to interact as if they were equals. Arguments are said to be assessed by the value of the claims themselves and not the social position of the poster&quot;.

Gastil sees this feature as one of the strongest points of the Internet: &quot;if computer-mediated interaction can consistently reduce the independent influence of status, it will have a powerful advantage over face-to-face deliberation&quot;. While status cues are difficult to detect, perceptions about the status converge, and this lessens stereotyping and prejudice.

It may be that people do feel more equal in online forums than they feel offline. Racism, ageism, and other kinds of discrimination against out groups &quot;seems to be diminishing because the cues to out-group status are not as obvious&quot;. Next to this, the Internet has rapidly and dramatically increased the capacities to develop, share and organize information, realizing more equality of access to information.

==Methodological research approaches==
The relationship between the perception of public opinion and willingness to speak-up is mainly measured through surveys. Surveys respondents are often asked whether they would reveal their opinions given a hypothetical situation, right after their opinions about the public opinion and their opinion is received. Whether asking hypothetical questions can reflect real life cases was questioned by some communication scholars, leading to a criticism of this methodology as not being able to capture what the respondent would do in a real-life situation. A research study addressed this criticism by comparatively testing a spiral model both in a hypothetical survey and in a focus group. The findings are in line with the critic of hypothetical survey questions, demonstrating a significant increase in the spiral of silence in focus groups.

Among different approaches to survey methodology, cross-sectional study design is the leading method employed to analyze and test the theory. Cross-sectional design involves the analysis of the relationship between public opinion and willingness to speak at one point in time.

While many of the researchers employ cross-sectional design, some scholars employed panel data. Under this methodology, three specific approaches have been used. Noelle-Neumann herself tested the theory from the aggregate level. Using this approach, the change process is &quot;observed by comparing the absolute share of people perceiving a majority climate with people willing to express their views over time.&quot; The second approach that has been used in spiral of silence research is conducting separate regressions for each panel survey wave. The drawback for this approach is that the individual change of climate and opinions perception is ignored. The last approach a few scholars used in conducting spiral of silence researches is to use changed scores as dependent variables. However, as intuitive as this approach may be, it &quot;leads to well-documented difficulties with respect to statistical properties, such as regression to the mean or the negative correlation of the change score with the time one state&quot;.

==Criticisms==
The critics of this theory most often claim that individuals have different influences that affect whether they speak out or not.

Research indicates that people fear isolation in their small social circles more than they do in the population at large. Within a large nation, one can always find a group of people who share one&#x27;s opinions, however people fear isolation from their close family and friends more in theory. Research has demonstrated that this fear of isolation is stronger than the fear of being isolated from the entire public, as it is typically measured.

Scholars have argued that both personal characteristics and various cultures among different groups will have influences on whether a person will willingly speak out. If one person &quot;has a positive self-concept and lacks a sense of shame, that person will speak out regardless of how she or he perceives the climate of public opinion.&quot; Another influence critics give for people choosing not to speak out against public opinion is culture. Some cultures are more individualistic, which would support more of an individual&#x27;s own opinion, while collectivist cultures support the overall group&#x27;s opinion and needs. Gender can be also considered as a cultural factor. In some cultures, women&#x27;s &quot;perception of language, not public opinion, forces them to remain quiet.&quot; Scheufele &amp; Moy, further assert that certain conflict styles and cultural indicators should be used to understand these differences.

The nature of issues will influence the dynamic processes of the spiral of silence. Yeric and Todd present three issues type, including enduring issues that will be discussed by the public for a long time; emerging issues that are new to the public but have the potential to become enduring issues; and the transitory issues, which don&#x27;t stay in the public consciousness for very long but come up from time to time. The research suggests that issues difference affects people&#x27;s willingness to express. Facebook users are more likely to post their real thoughts on emerging issues such as gay marriage in an incongruent opinion climate.

Another criticism of the spiral of silence research is that the research designs do not observe the movement in the spiral over time. Critics propose that Noelle-Neumann&#x27;s emphasis on time in the formation of the spiral should reflect on the methodology as well, and the dynamic nature of the spiral model should be acknowledged. They argue that the spiral of silence theory involves a &quot;time factor&quot;, considering that the changes in public opinion eventually lead to change in people&#x27;s assessments of the public opinion. Also, according to Spilchal, the spiral of silence theory &quot;ignores the evidence of the historical development of public opinion, both in theory and practice, through the extension of suffrage, organisation of political propaganda groups, the establishment of pressure groups and political parties, the eligibility of ever wider circles of public officials and, eventually, the installation of several forms of direct democracy.&quot;

Some scholars also provide understandings of the theory in the contemporary society by pointing out that &quot;it is not so much the actual statistical majority that generates pressure for conformity as it is the climate of opinion conveyed in large measure by the media.&quot; Under the great influence by the media coverage, the climate of opinion &quot;is not invariably an accurate reflection of the distribution of opinions within the polity.&quot;

Further, Scheufele &amp; Moy find problems in the operationalization of key terms, including willingness to speak out. This construct should be measured in terms of actually speaking out, not voting or other conceptually similar constructs. Conformity experiments have no moral component, yet morality is a key construct in the model. These conformity experiments, particularly those by Asch, form part of the base of the theory. Scholars question whether these conformity experiments are relevant to the development of the spiral of silence.

===False dilemmas and silence of consistency===
While the existence of groups with opinions other than those that are supposed to be dominant in a society provide a space for some people to express seemingly unpopular opinions, assumptions in such groups that criticism of their underrepresented opinion equates to support for society&#x27;s mainstream views is a source of false dilemmas.

Some research indicates that such false dilemmas, especially when there are inconsistencies both in mainstream views and in organized opposition views, causes a spiral of silence that specifically silences logically consistent third, fourth or higher number viewpoint criticism.

<doc id="473324" wikidata="Q1154547" url="?curid=473324" title="Uses and gratifications theory">
<text>Uses and gratifications theory is a communication theory that describes the reasons and means by which people seek out media to meet specific needs. The theory postulates that media is a highly available product, that audiences are the consumers of the product, and that audiences choose media to satisfy given needs as well as social and psychological uses, such as knowledge, relaxation, social relationships, and diversion.

Uses and gratifications theory was developed from a number of prior communication theories and research conducted by fellow theorists. The theory has a heuristic value because it gives communication scholars a &quot;perspective through which a number of ideas and theories about media choice, consumption, and even impact can be viewed&quot;.

==History==
=== 1940s: Basic premise ===
Beginning in the 1940s, researchers began to see patterns under the perspective of the uses and gratifications theory in radio listeners. Early research was concerned with topics such as children&#x27;s use of comics and the absence of newspapers during a newspaper strike. An interest in more psychological interpretations emerged during this time period. By 1944, researchers began to look into the earliest forms of uses and gratifications with their work classifying the reasons why people chose specific types of media. Herta Herzog interviewed various soap opera fans and was able to identify three types of gratifications based on why people listened to soap operas: emotional, wishful thinking, and learning. Then, in 1948, Lasswell introduced a four-functional interpretation of the media on a macro-sociological level: media served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for both society and individuals.

2 According to Richard West and Lynn Turner, UGT is an extension of Maslow&#x27;s Hierarchy of Needs that argues that people actively look to satisfy their needs based on a hierarchy. These needs are organized as a pyramid with the largest, most fundamental needs at the base and the need for self-actualization at the top. Wilbur Schramm developed the fraction of selection, a formula for determining which form of mass media an individual would select. The formula helped to decide the amount of gratification an individual would expect to gain from the medium over how much effort they had to make to achieve gratification. Elihu Katz, Jay Blumler, and Michael Gurevitch synthesized that UGT&#x27;s approach was focused on &quot;the social and psychological origins of needs, which generate expectations of the mass media or other sources, which lead to differential patterns of media exposure (or engagement in other activities), resulting in need gratifications and some other consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones.&quot;

=== 1970s: Five assumptions proposed ===
In 1969 Jay Blumler and Denis McQuail studied the 1964 election in the United Kingdom by examining people&#x27;s motives for watching certain political programs on television. By categorizing the audience&#x27;s motives for viewing a certain program, they aimed to understand any potential mass-media effects by classifying viewers according to their needs. The audience motivations they were able to identify helped lay the groundwork for their research in 1972 and eventually uses and gratifications theory. McQuail, Blumler and Joseph Brown suggested that the uses of different types of media could be grouped into 4 categories: diversion, personal relationships, personal identity, surveillance (i.e. forms of information seeking).

McQuail, Blumler and Brown were joined in their media exploration by Elihu Katz, Michael Gurevitch and Hadassah Haas, and their collaborative research began to indicate how people saw the mass media. A 1974 study by Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch stated five basic assumptions for a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences. These assumptions are:
#The audience is conceived as active.
#In the mass communication process, much initiative in linking gratification and media choice lies with the audience member.
#The media compete with other sources of satisfaction.
#Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves.
#Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms.

According to their research, goals for media use can be grouped into five uses. The audience wants to:
#Be informed or educated
#Identify with characters of the situation in the media environment
#Simple entertainment
#Enhance social interaction
#Escape from the stresses of daily life

=== Applications of UGT since 1980s ===
Rehman (1983) applied UGT to study the relationship between movie audience expectations and the satisfaction they derived from going to the movies. The following year Alan Rubin identified two main types of television viewers: ritualized (or, habitual) users and instrumental (or, non-habitual) users. Rubin defined the ritualized users as individuals who had a high regard for television, used television often, and primarily used it for the purpose of a diversion. Meanwhile, the instrumental users were defined as having a lower regard for television, did not use it often, and when they would use television it was for the purpose of acquiring information. Mark Levy and Sven Windahl identified three types of audience activity, which they labeled as preactivity, duractivity, and postactivity. Levy and Windahl described &quot;preactivity&quot; as seeking out certain media to gratify intellectual needs, &quot;duractivity&quot; as focusing on deciphering and interpreting messages, and &quot;postactivity&quot; as seeking out a message for personal or interpersonal benefit.

A year later, in 1985, Levy and Windahl provided a description of what it means to be an &quot;active consumer&quot; of media:
Then, in 1987, researchers Lewis Donohew, Philip Palmgreen, and J.D. Rayburn identified four different lifestyle types of television viewers, each with a variety of differences from the degrees to which the audience member watches TV, why they watch it, what their income and gender is, their marriage status, and so on. The four types are: disengaged homemaker, outgoing activist, restrained activist, and working class climber

The most recent interest surrounding UGT is the link between the reason why media is used and the achieved gratification. UGT researchers are developing the theory to be more predictive and explanatory by connecting the needs, goals, benefits, consequences of media consumption and use along with individual factors. Work in UGT was trailblazed by the research of Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch which built on Herzog&#x27;s research and caused a paradigm shift from how media influences people to how audiences use media, diminishing the dominance of the limited effects approach to mass media studies.

== Research issues ==
In the 1980s, Palmgreen and Rayburn proposed the model of gratifications sought (GS) and gratifications obtained (GO). GS are the rewards people seek from media, while GO are the rewards people receive from media. In their study, they found that correlations between individual GS and non-corresponding GOs were generally much lower, indicating considerable promise for a sought versus obtained conceptualization of uses and gratifications.

Palmgreen et al. conducted an investigation in 1985 that provides support for a process model of uses and gratifications based upon an expectancy-value approach. Results of the study supported the hypothesis that gratifications obtained are strongly related to the beliefs about media attributes but are not related to evaluations of those attributes. Further, the results demonstrated that gratifications sought and obtained may be measured at the same level of abstraction, contrary to earlier speculation.

==Modern applications==
The studies of Katz and his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation for building the uses and gratifications approach. Since then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current status of uses and gratifications is still based on Katz&#x27;s first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in an electronic information age when people have more options of media use.

=== Mobile phone usage ===
Mobile phones, a comparatively new technology, have many uses and gratifications attached to them. Due to their nature of mobility, constant access, and options to both add and access content, this field is expanding with new research on the motivations behind using mobile phones. In general, people use mobile phones for the following uses and gratifications: sociability, entertainment, status, immediate access, instrumentality, mobility, and psychological reassurance. Researchers have also identified that the uses and gratifications for contributing mobile content differ from those for retrieving mobile content.

The specific function of text messaging has also been studied to find its uses and gratifications and explore any potential gender differences. Seven uses and gratifications, in order of importance, have been proposed: accessibility, relaxation, escape, entertainment, information seeking, coordination for business, socialization, status seeking. The results also displayed gender differences, implying that social and societal expectations for females around independence and connection were a factor in their uses and gratification seeking. A study on instant messaging found that women chatted longer and for sociability; men chatted for less time per session and for entertainment and relaxation.

=== Internet usage ===
The Internet provides a new and deep field for exploring UGT. It was found to have three main categories of gratifications: content gratification, process gratification, and social gratification. Content uses and gratification include the need for researching or finding specific information or material, which are gratified with content. Process uses and gratification involve the experience of purposeful navigating or random browsing of the Internet in its functional process. Social uses and gratification encompass a wide range of forming and deepening social ties.

Scholars like LaRose utilize UGT to understand Internet usage via a socio-cognitive framework. This reduces uncertainties that arise from homogenizing an Internet audience and explaining media usage in terms of only positive gratifications. LaRose also created measures for self-efficacy and self-disparagement and related UGT to negative outcomes of online behavior, such as internet addiction.

=== Social media usage ===
Whereas basic research finds that socialization motivates use of friend-networking sites, uses and gratifications theory suggests that individual users will continue to be engaged with social networking sites if their gratifications and needs are fulfilled by such tools. Some further exploration has demonstrated that although emotional, cognitive, social, and habitual uses are motivational to use social media, not all uses are consistently gratified. By 2013, research has looked at social networking services, personal and subject-based blogs, and internet forums. The relationship between gratifications and narcissism, and the effects of age on this relationship and corresponding gratifications have also been studied. Overall, users have the following motivations: social and affection, need to vent negative feelings, recognition, entertainment, cognitive needs.

Users who share news are motivated by the uses and gratifications of socializing and status seeking, especially if they have had prior experience with social media. Users also engage in cyberbullying in order to fulfil a need to be vengeful and malicious, while avoiding face-to-face contact.

=== Online gaming ===
Achievement, enjoyment and social interaction are all motivations for starting to play an online game, with success at the game and the extent to which gamers&#x27; uses were gratified predicting continuance in playing. In 2017, researchers applied UGT to study user behavior among Pokémon Go players. Results show that enjoyment, physical activity, nostalgia, image, normative influences and flow drive various forms of user behavior. In addition, perceived physical risks, but not perceived privacy risks, lead to weaker forms of usage.

=== Entertainment media ===
Research has shown that media taken in for entertainment purposes have a wide range of uses and emotional gratifications, and that these are not mutually exclusive but can overlap with each other. Rehman (1983) demonstrated a relationship between gratifications sought and obtained from the movies and movie attendance. The most prominently cited emotional gratification of media use of mood management. UGT proposes that people prefer to maintain a state of intermediate arousal. When in a bad mood, bored, or over-aroused, people will seek media as regulation for or distraction from their mood. Another emotional gratification is affective disposition, which involves people experiencing gratificaition when rooting for characters depicted as good and moral. Other emotional gratifications include excitation transfer, sensation seeking, downward social comparison, mood adjustment, and competence.

Additionally, the modes of reception of entertainment media correlates with emotion involvement and can facilitate the pursuit of other goals. Entertainment media allows users to live out gender-socialised roles, satisfy parasocial relationships, live vicariously through fictional characters, and find meaning and purpose.

==Related theories==
===Media system dependency theory===
Media system dependency theory (MSDT or media dependency theory) has been studied as an offshoot of UGT. However, media dependency theory focuses on audiences&#x27; goals for media consumption as the source of their dependency; while uses and gratification theory focuses on audience&#x27;s needs as drivers for media consumption. MSDT states that as a person becomes increasingly dependent on media to satisfy their needs, that media will become more important in a person&#x27;s life and thereby have increased influence and effects on that person. MSDT acknowledges and builds upon UGT because it is based on the assumptions that people have different uses for media that arise from their needs.

=== Social cognitive theory ===
Building on UGT, Social Cognitive Theory helped distinguish GS versus GO stimulus for media consumption. Social cognitive theory explains behavior in terms of the reciprocal causation between individuals, environments, and behaviors. This allows for a more personal application of UGT instead of a large, blanketing assumption about a large audience of mass media. If GO is greater than GS then there will be more audience satisfaction. Lastly, audiences&#x27; GS are not always the reality of their GO.

=== Cultivation theory ===
Cultivation theory is concerned with understanding the role that media – specifically television – plays in shaping a person&#x27;s world view. Whereas UGT tries to understand the motivations that drive media usage, cultivation theory focuses on the psychological effects of media. Cultivation theory is used especially to study violence in television and how it shapes audience&#x27;s understanding of the reality of violence in society. Often, because of media&#x27;s influence, audiences have a more heightened and unrealistic perception of the amount of violence. A UGT approach may be implemented to Cultivation theory cases to understand why an audience would seek violent media and if audiences seek television violence to satisfy the need of confirmation of their worldview.

=== Hypodermic needle model ===
Hypodermic needle model (known as the hypodermic-syringe model, transmission-belt model, or magic bullet theory) is a model of communication suggesting that an intended message is directly received and wholly accepted by the receiver. The model was originally rooted in 1930s behaviourism and was largely considered obsolete for a long time, but big data analytics-based mass customisation has led to a modern revival of the basic idea. After that, a shift which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses and gratifications approach.

=== Mass media ===
In media studies, mass communication, media psychology, communication theory, and sociology, media influence and media effects are topics relating to mass media and media culture&#x27;s effects on individual or an audience&#x27;s thoughts, attitudes, and behavior. Whether it is written, televised, or spoken, mass media reaches a large audience. Mass media&#x27;s role and effect in shaping modern culture are central issues for study of culture.

==Theory criticism==
Uses and gratifications theory has, almost since its inception, been viewed critics as not meeting the standards necessary to be a theory. Critics argue that it instead is more of an approach to analysis or a data-collecting strategy. Common criticism include that gratifications are more dependent on input by researchers than on decisions made by research subjects; that early research utilized flawed methodologies that led findings to be overstimated; that audiences of different ages likely have different motivations for using identical media, and also likely have different gratifications; that most research relies on pure recollection of memory rather than data; and that it goes too far in claiming that people are free to choose the media and the interpretations they desire.

As a sociologically based theory, UGT has little to no benefit to psychology due to its weakness in operational definitions and weak analytical mode. It also is focused too narrowly on the individual and neglects the social structure and place of the media in that structure. Ruggiero wrote that &quot;most scholars agree that early research had little theoretical coherence and was primarily behaviorist and individualist in its methodological tendencies.&quot; Blumler and other critics have argued that the line between gratification and satisfaction is blurred, and Blumler wrote that &quot;the nature of the theory underlying uses and gratifications research is not totally clear.&quot; McQuail criticized the UGT as too cumbersome and tried to do too much, arguing that there is no real way of testing the theory through content analysis or surveys.

Among the most criticized tenets of uses and gratifications as theory is the assumption of an active audience. Ruggerio noted three assumptions necessary to the idea of active audience: First, media selection is initiated by the individual. Second, expectations regarding the use of media must be a product of individual predispositions, social interactions and environmental factors. And third, the active audience exhibits goal-directed behavior. This concept of active audience finds, at best, limited acceptance outside of the United States.

Jay Blumler presented a number of points as to why UGT cannot measure an active audience. He stated, &quot;The issue to be considered here is whether what has been thought about Uses and Gratifications Theory has been an article of faith and if it could now be converted into an empirical question such as: How to measure an active audience?&quot; Blumler then offered suggestions about the kinds of activity the audiences were engaging with in the different types of media: utility, intentionality, selectivity, and imperviousness to influence. In 1973, Blumler, McQuail and Brown extended Lasswell&#x27;s four groups to include four more primary factors for media usage: diversion, personal relationships, personal identity, and surveillance.

Severin and Tankard also argued that most of the data collection method used in uses and gratification studies are self-report questionnaires, which is not a reliable way to ascertain the genuine reason for using the media because they believe that individuals can not respond accurately to questions about their own feelings and behavior.

<doc id="473326" wikidata="Q2100949" url="?curid=473326" title="Poise (unit)">
<text>The poise (symbol P; ) is the unit of dynamic viscosity (absolute viscosity) in the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS). It is named after Jean Léonard Marie Poiseuille (see Hagen–Poiseuille equation). The centipoise (1 cP = 0.01 P) is more commonly used than the poise itself.

Dynamic viscosity has dimensions of formula_1, that is, formula_2.

formula_3

The analogous unit in the International System of Units is the pascal-second (Pa⋅s):

formula_4

The poise is often used with the metric prefix &quot;centi-&quot; because the viscosity of water at 20 °C (standard conditions for temperature and pressure) is almost exactly 1 centipoise. A centipoise is one hundredth of a poise, or one millipascal-second (mPa⋅s) in SI units (1 cP = 10−3 Pa⋅s = 1 mPa⋅s).

The CGS symbol for the centipoise is cP. The abbreviations cps, cp, and cPs are sometimes seen.

Liquid water has a viscosity of 0.00890 P at 25 °C at a pressure of 1 atmosphere (0.00890 P = 0.890 cP = 0.890 mPa⋅s).

<text>Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk (, , ) is a city and the administrative center of Sakhalin Oblast, Russia. It is located on Sakhalin Island in the Russian Far East, north of Japan. Gas and oil extraction as well as processing are amongst the main industries on the island. It was called Vladimirovka () from 1882 to 1905, then during its period of Imperial Japanese control from 1905 to 1946. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 181,728.

==History==
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk began as a small Russian settlement called Vladimirovka, founded by convicts in 1882. The Treaty of Portsmouth in 1905, which brought an end to the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, awarded the southern half of the Sakhalin Island to Japan. Vladimirovka was renamed Toyohara (meaning &quot;bountiful plain&quot;), and was the prefect capital of the Japanese Karafuto Prefecture.
During the Soviet–Japanese War within World War II, the city was recaptured by Soviet troops. Ownership of the city was transferred to the Soviet Union and it was renamed Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. Town status was granted to it in 1946.

==Administrative and municipal status==

Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk is the administrative center of the oblast. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with ten rural localities, incorporated as the city of oblast significance of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk is incorporated as Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Urban Okrug.

==Economy and infrastructure==
Due to significant investment from oil companies like ExxonMobil and Shell, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk has experienced substantial economic growth. Although this growth has primarily occurred in the northern part of the island, both companies maintain headquarters and residential complexes in the city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk itself. The demand for natural resources by the Japanese, Chinese, and South Koreans has ensured continued prosperity in the foreseeable future for the entire island.

There has been significant criticism, including from Presidential Envoy Kamil Iskhakov, that Sakhalin is not caring for its citizens. Despite sizable gas deposits and incoming investments from gas companies, the regional administration does not yet have plans for the installation of gas services on the island. However, several improvements in the city have been made in the past 10 years, and it continues to grow in various aspects every year. 

One of the very few remaining Japanese buildings in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk now functions as the local museum. The building was designed in the Emperor&#x27;s Crown Style by Japanese architect Yoshio Kaizuka, and completed in 1937.
===Transportation===
The city hosts the head office of Aurora Airline, subsidiary of Aeroflot. It is served by the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Airport. The city is also the hub for the island&#x27;s narrow gauge railway network that underwent conversion to Russian broad gauge in August 2019. In addition to railways, the town is also a hub for roadways, such as the A-391 (which travels south to Korsakov) and the A-392 (which travels west to Kholmsk).

Due to restrictions, foreigners wishing to leave Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in order to travel to any other part of the Sakhalin Oblast and its internal and territorial waters are required to seek permission from the Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Border Guard. Scuba diving and recreating on the seacoast is permitted only in places defined by the Border Guard.
==Education==
Institutes of elementary and middle education include Sakhalin International School.

Institutes of higher education in the city include Sakhalin State University and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Institute of Economics, Law and Informatics. There are also some branches of other universities:
*Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk institute (branch) of Russian State trade-economics university
*Branch of Far East State university of railways
*Branch of Modern Academy of the humanities
*Branch of The Pacific State economics university
*Branch of Russian economics academy named after G.V. Plekhanov
*Branch of Far East law institute

==Sport==
There exist numerous sport venues and clubs in Sakhalin. FC Sakhalin Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, PSK Sakhalin, Vostok-65, Sakhalin Sharks, Sakhalin for football, hockey, basketball, youth hockey and volleyball respectively. Mount Bolshevik provides the Gorny Vozdukh (&quot;Mountain Air&quot;) ski resort which is qualified for international competitions.

== Demographics ==
=== Population ===

Most residents are ethnic Russians, but there also exists a sizable population of Korean Russians. Of the 43,000 Sakhalin Koreans, half are estimated to live in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, comprising roughly 12% of the city&#x27;s population. Also smaller numbers of indigenous minorities, such as Ainu, Nivkhs and Oroks can be found.

=== Religion ===
The majority of the population are Russian Orthodox.

==Geography==
The city is located on the Susuya River. It is the largest city on the island, and the only one with more than 100,000 inhabitants. The straight-line distance to Moscow is .

===Climate===
The climate is humid continental (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with mild summers and cold winters. Maritime influences can be seen in that precipitation is much higher than in interior Russia and that summers are distinctly cooler than in Khabarovsk or Irkutsk, while winters are much milder. Summers are frequently foggy, reducing the amount of sunshine. Considering its southerly maritime position winters are very cold, albeit warmer than expected for surrounding inland areas affected by the Siberian High. Snowfall is more frequent than in those areas, due to said maritime influence bringing moisture to the coastline. Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk is relatively sunny compared to Hokkaido locations, but gloomy by the lower latitudes of the Russian Far East&#x27;s standards.

==Twin towns and sister cities==
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk is twinned with:
* Asahikawa, Japan
* Hakodate, Japan
* Wakkanai, Japan
* Yanji, China
* Ansan, South Korea

== Notable people ==

* Natalya Pechonkina (maiden name Burda, later Chistyakova); born July 15, 1946, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk) is a Soviet athlete. She competed for the USSR in the 1968 Summer Olympics held in Mexico City in the 400 metres where she won the bronze medal.
* Alexander Godunov; born November 28, 1949, died May 18, 1995, was a Russian-American ballet dancer and film actor.

<doc id="473338" wikidata="Q354542" url="?curid=473338" title="Ray Brown (musician)">
<text>Raymond Matthews Brown (October 13, 1926 – July 2, 2002) was an American jazz double bassist, known for his extensive work with Oscar Peterson and Ella Fitzgerald. He was also a founding member of the group that would later develop into the Modern Jazz Quartet.

==Early life==
Ray Brown was born on October 13, 1926, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and took piano lessons as a child. After noticing how many pianists attended his high school, he thought of taking up the trombone, but his father was unable to afford one. With a vacancy in the high school jazz orchestra, he took up the upright bass instead. 

A major early influence on Brown&#x27;s bass playing was Jimmy Blanton, the bassist in the Duke Ellington band. Brown&#x27;s high school music teacher believed that he was a diligent student, as he took the bass home with him on weekends. Brown, however, was already using the school bass in gigs; when this was discovered, the bass had to be returned and Brown&#x27;s father bought him one. Brown graduated high school in 1944.

==Later life and career==
As a young man Brown became increasingly well known in the Pittsburgh jazz scene, with his first experiences playing in bands with the Jimmy Hinsley Sextet and the Snookum Russell band. Later, having heard stories about the burgeoning jazz scene on 52nd Street in New York City, he bought a one-way ticket to New York. He arrived in New York at the age of 20, met up with Hank Jones, with whom he had previously worked, and was introduced to Dizzy Gillespie, who was looking for a bass player. Gillespie hired Brown on the spot, and he soon played with such established musicians as Art Tatum and Charlie Parker. In 1948, Brown left Dizzy&#x27;s band to start a trio with Hank Jones and Charlie Smith.

From 1946 to 1951, Brown played in Gillespie&#x27;s band. Brown, along with the vibraphonist Milt Jackson, drummer Kenny Clarke, and pianist John Lewis formed the rhythm section of the Gillespie band. Lewis, Clarke, and Jackson eventually formed the Modern Jazz Quartet. Brown became acquainted with singer Ella Fitzgerald when she joined the Gillespie band as a special attraction for a tour of the southern United States in 1947. The two married that year, and together they adopted a child born to Fitzgerald&#x27;s half-sister Frances, whom they christened Ray Brown, Jr. Fitzgerald and Brown divorced in 1953, bowing to the various career pressures both were experiencing at the time, though they would continue to perform together.
From 1951 to 1965, Brown was a member of the Oscar Peterson Trio. The trio included a guitarist until 1958 (initially Barney Kessel, and then Herb Ellis). After Ellis left the group, Peterson decided to continue the trio with Brown and drummer Ed Thigpen. Brown recorded extensively as a session musician for producer Norman Granz during the 1950s (for Granz&#x27;s Clef, Norgran, and Verve record labels), often alongside Peterson. After leaving the Oscar Peterson Trio, Brown concentrated on studio work in Los Angeles.

In the early 1960s, Brown began teaching, at the Advanced School of Contemporary Music, based in Toronto.

Brown guested as a bass player on &quot;Razor Boy&quot;, the second track on Steely Dan&#x27;s second album, &quot;Countdown to Ecstasy&quot;, released in 1973.

From 1974 to 1982, Brown performed and recorded a series of albums with guitarist Laurindo Almeida, saxophonist and flutist Bud Shank, and drummer Shelly Manne (replaced by Jeff Hamilton after 1977) under the name The L.A. Four.

In the 1980s and 1990s Brown led his own trios and continued to refine his bass playing style. In his later years he recorded and toured extensively with pianist Gene Harris. In the early 1980s, Brown met Diana Krall in a restaurant in Nanaimo, British Columbia. According to Jeff Hamilton, in an interview recorded on the &quot;Diana Krall Live in Rio&quot; DVD, he first heard Krall play at a workshop and, impressed with her piano skills (she was not yet singing), introduced her to bassist John Clayton. Hamilton and Clayton both encouraged Krall to move to Los Angeles to study under Brown and others. In 1986 Brown played bass on the song “Poisoned Rose” on Elvis Costello’s King of America album. In 1990, he teamed up with pianist Bobby Enriquez and drummer Foster, for Enriquez&#x27;s album, &quot;The Wildman Returns&quot;.

Around the same time, Brown made seven albums with pianist André Previn when, after a hiatus of two decades, Previn returned to jazz to perform and record regularly again between 1989 and 2002: &quot;After Hours&quot; (1989, with guitarist Joe Pass), &quot;Uptown&quot; (1990, with guitarist Mundell Lowe), &quot;Old Friends&quot; (1992, live recording, with guitarist Mundell Lowe), &quot;Kiri Sidetracks. The Jazz Album&quot; (1992, with singer Kiri Te Kanawa and guitarist Mundell Lowe), &quot;What Headphones?&quot; (1992, with Mundell Lowe, Jim Pugh on trombone, Warren Vache on cornet, Richard Todd on horn, Grady Tate on drums, and The Antioch Baptist Choir), &quot;André Previn and Friends Play Show Boat&quot; (1995, with Mundell Lowe and Grady Tate), and &quot;Jazz at the Musikverein&quot; (1997, live recording, with Mundell Lowe). Brown and Previn had recorded together before in the 1960s on &quot;4 To Go!&quot; (1963, with guitarist Herb Ellis and drummer Shelly Manne) and &quot;Right as the Rain&quot; (1967, with singer Leontyne Price). An hour-long film, &quot;Together on Broadway. The Making of Sidetracks&quot; documents the work on the album &quot;Kiri Sidetracks. The Jazz Album&quot;.

Brown played for a time with the &quot;Quartet&quot; with Monty Alexander, Milt Jackson, and Mickey Roker. After that he toured again with his own trio, with several young pianists such as Benny Green, Geoffrey Keezer, and Larry Fuller. The last edition of the Ray Brown Trio included pianist Larry Fuller and drummer Karriem Riggins. With that trio, Brown continued to perform until his death. Brown died in his sleep on July 2, 2002, after having played golf, before a show in Indianapolis.

==Awards and honors==
In 1995, Brown was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music. In 2001, Brown was awarded the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class and in 2003, he was inducted into the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Jazz Hall of Fame.

He was awarded his first Grammy for his composition &quot;Gravy Waltz&quot;, a tune which would later be used as the theme song for &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;.

<doc id="473342" wikidata="Q238331" url="?curid=473342" title="Mona Simpson">
<text>Mona Simpson (née Jandali; June 14, 1957) is an American novelist. She has written six novels and studied English at University of California, Berkeley, and languages and literature at Columbia University.
She won a Whiting Award for her first novel, &quot;Anywhere but Here&quot; (1986). It was a popular success and adapted as a film by the same name, released in 1999. She wrote a sequel, &quot;The Lost Father&quot; (1992). Critical recognition has included the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; Heartland Prize and making the shortlist for the PEN/Faulkner Award for her novel &quot;Off Keck Road&quot; (2000).

She is the biological younger sister of the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. She was born after her parents had married and did not meet Jobs, who was placed for adoption after he was born, until she was 25 years old.

==Early life==
Mona Jandali was born on June 14, 1957, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, to a Swiss-German American mother, Joanne Carole Schieble, and a Syrian father, Abdulfattah &quot;John&quot; (al-)Jandali (Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي). While Jandali and Schieble were still unmarried students at the University of Wisconsin in 1954, Schieble became pregnant and, given her parents&#x27; resistance to the relationship, decided to place the baby for adoption. Six months after she placed the baby for adoption, Schieble&#x27;s father died, and she then wed Jandali and gave birth to Mona. They divorced in 1962. When Schieble remarried, both she and Mona took the name of her new husband, George Simpson. In 1970, after they divorced, Schieble took Mona to Los Angeles and raised her on her own.

Simpson described herself as a good student as a child but was also &quot;a clown&quot; and &quot;a smart aleck&quot; who used to make jokes in class. &quot;I did get in trouble a lot when I was older and then I didn&#x27;t like school so much anymore.&quot; She attended Beverly Hills High School and received a scholarship to attend University of California, Berkeley where she studied poetry: &quot;I stuck with poetry as long as I could—as far as my talent would take me.&quot; After she finished her B.A. at Berkeley, she worked at a job during the days and worked as a journalist during the nights and on the weekends. She enjoyed journalism and hoped for a position with the &quot;California Independent &amp; Gazette&quot; (Richmond, California) but did not receive it. She then attended graduate school at Columbia University and received her M.F.A from there. While a student at Columbia University, she was an editor for &quot;Paris Review.&quot;

In 1986, Schieble was contacted by the son she had given up for adoption, Steve Jobs, who had recently lost his mother to lung cancer. To that point, Simpson was unaware that she had an older brother. Schieble then arranged for Jobs and Simpson to meet in New York where Simpson worked. The two became good friends, and worked together to locate their father, eventually locating Jandali in Sacramento. Simpson later fictionalized the search for their father in the 1992 novel, &quot;The Lost Father&quot;. (She would create a fictionalized portrait of Jobs in the 1996 novel, &quot;A Regular Guy.&quot;)

In 1994, Simpson returned to the Los Angeles area with her then-husband, Richard Appel. In 2001, Simpson started teaching creative writing at UCLA; she also has an appointment at Bard College in New York state.

==Novels==

Simpson&#x27;s novels are drawn from life experiences. Her first novel, &quot;Anywhere But Here&quot; (1986), was a critical and popular success, winning a Whiting Award. In describing her intentions for the novel, Simpson stated: 

I wanted to write about American mythologies, American yearnings that might be responses, delayed or exaggerated but in some way typical, to the political and social truths of our part of the world in our century. But I wrote very personally about one family. I think it takes a long time before a crisis—like AIDS—enters the culture to a point where responses exist in a character, where personal gestures are both individual and resonant in a larger way.It was adapted as the 1999 film &quot;Anywhere But Here&quot;, starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman. Simpson published a sequel, &quot;The Lost Father&quot; (1992).

&quot;A Regular Guy&quot; (1996) explores the strained relationship of a Silicon Valley tycoon with a daughter born out of wedlock, whom he did not acknowledge. &quot;Off Keck Road&quot; (2000), portraying decades in the lives of three women in the Midwest, was a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award and won the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; Heartland Prize. Stacey D&#x27;Erasmo said, &quot;&quot;Off Keck Road&quot; marks the place where origin leaves off and improvisation begins&quot;. &quot;My Hollywood&quot; was published in 2011. It explores the complex relationships, issues of class, and perspectives of two women, Claire, a European-American composer in her 30s and mother of one son, and Lola, her immigrant nanny from the Philippines. The nanny supports her own five children in the Philippines. The novel alternates between the voices of the two women, contrasting their worlds.

==Personal life==
Simpson married television writer and producer Richard Appel in 1993 and had two children. Appel, a writer for &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, named Homer Simpson&#x27;s mother Mona Simpson after his wife, beginning with the episode &quot;Mother Simpson&quot;. They later divorced. Simpson&#x27;s paternal cousins include Malek Jandali and Bassma Al Jandaly.

<doc id="473352" wikidata="Q7410355" url="?curid=473352" title="Samson (magazine)">
<text>Samson (月刊サムソン) is a monthly Japanese magazine for gay men. 

Gay magazines in Japan, along with much gay culture, are segregated by &quot;type&quot;; most are aimed at an audience with specific interests. &quot;Samson&quot; specializes in daddies, older, chubby men and salarymen in suits and occasionally fundoshi, or traditional Japanese loincloths.

==Overview==
&quot;Samson&quot; was started in 1982. The magazine features photographs and drawings which, while they feature explicit depictions of sex, are censored in accordance with Japanese law to obscure genitals and pubic hair. 

Like &quot;G-men&quot;, &quot;Samson&quot; has fewer general articles than other magazines such as Barazoku and more short fiction and serialized stories. Each month there are community listings, several different stories—often pornographic—and several in comic form as well, and advertisements from gay-related and gay-friendly businesses such as day spas, clubs and hotels, bars, cafes and restaurants, host bars (hustler bars), brothels, and so forth. 

Readers can also place personal ads free of charge, and each month there are several pages of these, most from men in search of romantic attachments, friends or sex partners. Such ads have long been a popular way for gay men to meet each other in Japan, though text messaging and the internet are probably more popular now. 

The magazine is printed in Japanese only.

<doc id="473355" wikidata="Q5313130" url="?curid=473355" title="Duke of Wellington's Regiment">
<text>The Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment (West Riding) was a line infantry regiment of the British Army, forming part of the King&#x27;s Division.

In 1702, Colonel George Hastings, 8th Earl of Huntingdon, was authorised to raise a new regiment, which he did in and around the city of Gloucester. As was the custom in those days the regiment was named Huntingdon&#x27;s Regiment after its Colonel. As Colonel succeeded Colonel the name changed, but in 1751 regiments were given numbers, and the regiment was from that time officially known as the 33rd Regiment of Foot. In 1782, the regiment&#x27;s title was changed to the 33rd (or First Yorkshire West Riding) Regiment, thus formalising an association with the West Riding of Yorkshire which, even then, had been long established. The first Duke of Wellington died in 1852 and in the following year Queen Victoria, in recognition of the regiment&#x27;s long ties to him, ordered that the regiment&#x27;s title be changed to the 33rd (or The Duke of Wellington&#x27;s) Regiment. In 1881, following the Childers Reforms, the 33rd was linked with the 76th Regiment of Foot, who shared their depot in Halifax. The 76th had first been raised in 1745, by Simon Harcourt and disbanded in 1746, re-raised in 1756, disbanded again in 1763, before being raised again in 1777, disbanded in 1784 and finally re-raised, in 1787, for service in India, by the Honourable East India Company. The two regiments became, respectively, the 1st and 2nd battalions of the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment. In 1948, the 1st and 2nd battalions were amalgamated into a single battalion, the 1st Battalion. On 6 June 2006, the &#x27;Dukes&#x27; were amalgamated with the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Regiment of Yorkshire and the Green Howards to form the Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot). As the youngest regiment, the &#x27;Dukes&#x27; became the 3rd Battalion, as each battalion retained their antecedent regiment&#x27;s name in brackets. Following further mergers, in 2012, the battalion was redesignated as the new 1st Battalion (1 Yorks) of the regiment. At this point, the antecedent regimental names were dropped from the battalion titles.

Battalions from the regiment had served in most land conflicts involving British forces since its formation, from the Wars of the Austrian and Spanish successions, through the American war of Independence and various campaigns in India and Africa, the Napoleonic Wars, the Second Boer War and many of the greatest battles of the First World War (the Battle of Mons, the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Passchendaele, the Battle of Cambrai) and the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919. During the Second World War, the regiment fought as part of the British Expeditionary Force in France, forming part of the rearguard at Dunkirk; in North Africa; Italy and in France, following the D-Day landings, and as Chindits in Burma. In Korea, the &#x27;Dukes&#x27; desperate defence of the Hook position halted the last major Chinese attempt to break the United Nations Line before the truce, in July 1953, brought the war to an end. In Cyprus, the battalion was successful in Operation Golden Rain, destroying a major EOKA terrorist group operating in the Troodos Mountains in 1956. In 1964, the battalion joined the NATO deterrence in Germany on the front line in the Cold War and from 1971 was regularly engaged in &#x27;The Troubles&#x27; in Northern Ireland until 1997. They were amongst the first units to cross the border from Kuwait in the 2003 Iraq War.

Nine soldiers from the regiment have been awarded the Victoria Cross, and Corporal Wayne Mills of the 1st Battalion became the first recipient of the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross in 1994, whilst serving with the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==Formation and name==
The Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment was originally formed in 1702 as Huntingdon&#x27;s Regiment. As regiment designations at that time assumed the name of commanding Colonel, this unit became for example: Henry Leigh&#x27;s Regiment; then Robert Duncansons Regiment and George Wade&#x27;s Regiment. Disbanded on 25 March 1714, this unit was officially registered as the 33rd Regiment of Foot in January 1715 then re-raised on 25 March 1715, as George Wade&#x27;s Regiment; then Henry Hawley&#x27;s Regiment; Robert Dalzell&#x27;s Regiment and John Johnson&#x27;s Regiment.

In 1782 Lord Cornwallis, the then Colonel of the Regiment, wrote that &quot;The 33rd Regiment of Infantry has always recruited in the West Riding of Yorkshire and has a very good interest and the general goodwill of the people in that part of the country:- I should therefore wish not only to be permitted to recruit in that county, but that my Regiment may bear the name of the 33rd or West Yorkshire Regiment&quot;. On 31 August 1782 Lord Cornwallis heard that the King had approved of the new title:- 33rd (or the First Yorkshire West Riding) Regiment of Foot.

Owing to its links with the Duke of Wellington, the title &#x27;The Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment&#x27; was granted to the 33rd Regiment on 18 June 1853, on the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo in the year following Wellington&#x27;s death.

The 76th Regiment was originally raised, by Simon Harcourt as Lord Harcourt&#x27;s Regiment on 17 November 1745 and disbanded in June 1746. Following the loss of Menorca, to the French, it was reraised in November 1756 as the 61st Regiment, but renumbered to 76th, by General Order in 1758, and again disbanded in 1763. A second battalion raised by that regiment in October 1758, for service in Africa, was renumbered as the 86th Regiment and also disbanded in 1763. On 25 December 1777, the 76th was again re-raised, as the 76th Regiment of Foot (Macdonald&#x27;s Highlanders), by Colonel John MacDonell of Lochgarry, in the West of Scotland and Western Isles, as a Scottish Light Infantry regiment. It was disbanded at Stirling Castle in March 1784. The regiment was again raised for service in India by the Honorable East India Company in 1787.

In 1881 the 76th Regiment, which shared the same Depot in Halifax as the 33rd, was linked to the 33rd, under the Childers Reforms, to become the 2nd Battalion. Although retitled as the Halifax Regiment (Duke of Wellington&#x27;s) this title only lasted six months until it was changed on 30 June 1881, in a revised appendix to General order 41, to:- The Duke of Wellington&#x27;s (West Riding Regiment), or &#x27;W Rid R&#x27; for short. In January 1921 it was again retitled to The Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment (West Riding), or &#x27;DWR&#x27; for short.
==1702–1881==

Within months of its original raising the regiment was despatched to join Marlborough&#x27;s army in Holland. After five months and only two battles it was sent to Portugal, along with five other of Malborough&#x27;s best regiments, where it remained for the next six years. The 33rd fought in many battles including Valencia de Alcantara (1705), Zaragossa (1710), and less favourably at Almansa and Brihuega. It was only one of the two foot regiments not to be disbanded and in 1743 the regiment was sent to Germany, where it distinguished itself in the Battle of Dettingen, gaining its first battle honour, then again at the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745 and again in Rocoux and Lauffeld in 1747. During the late 18th century, the regiment gained the familiar nickname The Havercakes, due to its sergeants carrying oatcakes on the tip of their swords to attract new recruits.

===American Revolution===
The 33rd itself had a good reputation for its professionalism and capability, which was seemingly unequalled by any other regiment of the British Army for some time. It was because of their professionalism in the field during the American War of Independence, that the regiment was given the nickname &#x27;The Pattern&#x27;; the regiment then became the standard of soldiering which all other regiments should attain.

The 33rd saw much action during the American War of Independence, with its first engagement at the Battle of Sullivan&#x27;s Island (First Siege of Charleston) in early 1776, when British forces attempted an assault on that city&#x27;s defences. In August of that year, the 33rd were involved in the Battle of Long Island, in which a heavy defeat was inflicted on the Americans, who evacuated their remaining forces to the island of Manhattan.

The regiment&#x27;s next action came a fortnight later, on 16 September at the Battle of Harlem Heights. After the British had landed and seized New York, a force of British light infantry pursuing an American scouting patrol advanced too far from their lines and found itself in danger of being cut off in an unexpected counterattack. The 33rd formed part of Lord Cornwallis&#x27; Reserve Corps sent in support to cover their withdrawal.

The regiment was also involved in the Battle of Fort Washington. After that, the 33rd were not involved in a major battle until September 1777, when they took part in the Battle of Brandywine, where the British suffered 550 casualties and the Americans about 1,000. The regiment took part in further action that year, at the Battle of Germantown and the Battle of White Marsh, where they fought the Americans who had retreated from the fighting at Germantown.

The following year was just as active, with the 33rd seeing action at the Battle of Monmouth, an inclusive engagement that became the largest one-day battle of the war. The 33rd was also part of the defence of Newport and Quaker Hill.

Two years later, in 1780, the 33rd took part in the Siege of Charleston. By 11 May, the American General Benjamin Lincoln began to negotiate terms of surrender. The following day Lincoln, along with over 7,000 American soldiers, surrendered to the British forces under the command of Lieutenant-General Henry Clinton. In August that year, the 33rd were involved at the Battle of Camden, a victory for the British.

====Guilford Court House====

The year 1781 proved to be the deadliest but most successful year for the 33rd. The regiment took part in the Battle of Wetzell&#x27;s Mill, but the more famous action took place that same month during a battle at Guilford Court House.

On 14 March 1781, Lord Cornwallis, the British commander, was informed that General Richard Butler was marching to attack his army. With Butler was a body of North Carolina Militia, plus reinforcements from Virginia, consisting of 3,000 Virginia Militia, a Virginia State regiment, a Corp of Virginian &quot;eighteen-month men&quot; and recruits for the Maryland Line. They had joined the command of Major General Nathanael Greene, creating a force of some four to five thousand men in total. During the night, further reports confirmed the American force was at Guilford Court House, some 12 miles (20 km) away. Cornwallis decided to give battle, though he had only 1,900 men at his disposal.

At dawn on 15 March 1781, before the men had a chance to have breakfast, Cornwallis started for Guilford, arriving there at mid-day.

Cornwallis&#x27; troops included Bose&#x27;s Hessian Regiment and the 71st commanded by Major General Alexander Leslie and the 23rd and 33rd commanded by Lieutenant Colonel James Webster of the 33rd. The second line comprised the two battalions of Foot Guards, the Light Infantry and the Grenadiers commanded by Brigadier Charles O&#x27;Hara of the 2nd Coldstream Regiment of Foot Guards. There was then a reserve consisting of Tarleton&#x27;s Light Dragoons.

The British troops advanced under heavy musket fire. Webster attacked the right flank of the American second line and managed to push it back. He also attacked the American third line. An American counterattack then led to a confused situation. Meanwhile, Tarleton&#x27;s Light Dragoons charged the right flank. The American troops then withdrew. The British technically defeated the American force, but Webster was killed and O&#x27;Hara was wounded.

====Green Spring====
The 33rd also fought at the Battle of Green Spring in July of that year. Their last engagement of the war was at the Siege of Yorktown, when they were part of the outnumbered British forces.

===Flanders===
In 1793 Arthur Wesley, the third son of the Earl of Mornington and future Duke of Wellington, purchased a commission in the 33rd as a Major. A few months later, in September, his brother lent him more money and with it he purchased a lieutenant-colonelcy in the 33rd.
The regiment took part in the disastrous Flanders Campaign and the retreat from Germany, and embarked, from Bremen, for England on 13 April 1795. Wesley was promoted to full Colonel by seniority on 3 May 1796 and changed his name to Arthur Wellesley in 1798.

===India===
In 1799 the regiment took part in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War in a Division commanded by Colonel Arthur Wellesley, as part of a British East India Company army, commanded by Major General Harris, with Major General Sir David Baird as second in command. Arthur&#x27;s eldest brother Richard Wellesley, 2nd Earl of Mornington, later 1st Marquess Wellesley, had just become Governor General of India. So in addition to the 33rd, Arthur, who had now become Colonel Arthur Wellesley, was given command of the 10,000 men of the Nizam of Hyderabad. They had a decisive part to play in the Battle of Seringapatam. The regiment, involved in bitter fighting with Tipu Sultan&#x27;s warriors, were repulsed with heavy losses when they attacked a wood, which was strongly defended by the Sultan&#x27;s forces. The 33rd rallied and fought further actions throughout the battle, with the British emerging decisively victorious and Tipu Sultan being killed. The regiment won a battle honour for its involvement in the action.

===Napoleon&#x27;s Return and Waterloo===
By early March 1815, the regiment was again under the command of the Duke of Wellington, this time during the Hundred Days campaign of Napoleon. Having taken part in the action of the previous day, at the Battle of Quatre Bras, they took part in the action at Waterloo; the 33rd was part of the 5th Brigade under the command of Major General Sir Colin Halkett.

===West Indies===
Having departed from Paris on 23 December 1815, the regiment spent the post Waterloo period, from January 1816 to 1821, in uneventful garrison duties in Guernsey, Stirling, Glasgow, Ulster and Dublin.

In 1822, the regiment was posted to Jamaica. The West Indies were notorious as the death bed of the British Army because of the high mortality rate from malaria, dysentery, yellow fever and other such endemic diseases.

===Crimea===
Owing to its links with Wellington, the title 33rd (The Duke of Wellington&#x27;s) Regiment was granted to the 33rd, on 18 June 1853 (the 38th Anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo) by Queen Victoria, in honour of the 1st Duke of Wellington, who had died on 14 September the previous year.

At the Battle of Alma, bitter fighting took place, with the 33rd being part of the Light Division under the command of Sir George Brown. The British advanced up the slope towards the Russian positions. The British formations became intermingled, turning into a mass of soldiers, rather than the professional, neat formations used on parade. As they charged, numerous Russian troops came down the slope to meet them. The British halted and fired, causing so many casualties the Russians were forced to retreat. The British line reorganised and moved up the slope towards the Great Redoubt, with the 33rd being the first to attack the defence works. The 33rd suffered heavy casualties: 7 officers and 232 men in the hand-to-hand combat that ensued.

At the Battle of Inkerman, the 33rd were again involved in some bitter fighting, in which the British infantry advanced despite heavy losses and a strong defence by the Russians. The fighting was fierce, at times some soldiers resorting to attacking their enemy with the butts of their guns. The 33rd suffered further casualties: 3 officers and 61 men.

The 33rd was involved in the Siege of Sevastopol, which lasted for 11 months. By 1856, the war was over but for little gain.

===Abyssinia===

The 33rd were part of an expedition sent to the East African nation of Abyssinia, now known as Ethiopia after several European citizens had been taken hostage by the self-appointed &#x27;King&#x27; Emperor Tewodros II in 1864. In March 1866 a British envoy had been despatched to secure the release of a group of missionaries who had first been seized after the British Government refused Tewdros&#x27;s requests for military assistance.

The 33rd was committed to Abyssinia in October 1867 and embarked on 21 November, arriving at Annesley Bay on 4 December; but did not disembark for three days due to the chaos on shore.

Lord Napier arrived in early January 1868 and the expedition started from the advance camp at Senafe at the beginning of February. It took two months to reach their objective, advancing through rough terrain. In his despatch to London Lord Napier reported: &quot;Yesterday morning (we) descended three thousand nine hundred feet to Bashilo River and approached Magdala with &#x27;First Brigade&#x27; to reconnoiter it. Theodore opened fire with seven guns from outwork, one thousand feet above us, and three thousand five hundred men of the garrison made a gallant sortie which was repulsed with very heavy loss and the enemy driven into Magdala. British loss, twenty wounded&quot;.

As the British force moved on to Magdala, Tewodros II sent two of the hostages on parole to offer terms. Napier insisted on the release of all the hostages and an unconditional surrender. Tewodros refused to cede to the unconditional surrender, but did release the European hostages. The British continued the advance and assaulted the fortress. (The native hostages were later found to have had their hands and feet cut off before being sent over the edge of the precipice surrounding the plateau.)

On reaching the gate there was a pause in the advance, as it was discovered the engineer unit had forgot their powder kegs and scaling ladders and were ordered to return for them. General Staveley was not happy at any further delay and ordered the 33rd to continue the attack. Several officers and the men of the 33rd Regiment, along with an officer from the Royal Engineers, parted from the main force and, after climbing the cliff face, found their way blocked by a thorny hedge over a wall. Private James Bergin, a very tall man, used his bayonet to cut a hole in the hedge and Drummer Michael Magner climbed onto his shoulders through the hedge in the gap and dragged Bergin up behind him as Ensign Conner and Corporal Murphy helped shove from below. Bergin kept up a rapid rate of fire on the Koket-Bir as Magner dragged more men through the gap in the hedge. As more men poured through and opened fire as they advanced with their bayonets the defenders withdrew through the second gate. The party rushed the Koket-bir before it was fully closed and then took the second gate breaking through to the Amba. Ensign Wynter scrambled up onto the top of the second gate and fixed the 33rd Regiments Colours to show the Plateau had been taken. Private Bergin and Drummer Magner were later awarded the Victoria Cross for their part in the action.

Tewodros II was found dead inside the second gate, having shot himself with a pistol that had been a gift from Queen Victoria. When his death was announced all opposition ceased. The regiment later received the battle honour Abyssinia.

==Volunteers==
The invasion scare of 1859 led to the creation of the Volunteer Force and huge enthusiasm for joining local Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs). A large number of individual RVCs were raised in the West Riding; some amalgamated into larger units, and the rest of the smaller units were grouped into administrative battalions. For example, the RVCs raised in Halifax were amalgamated as the 4th Yorkshire (West Riding) RVC in 1860. The senior unit in the 5th Admin Bn at Huddersfield was the 6th Yorkshire (West Riding) RVC, officially entitled the Huddersfield Rifles in 1868. In 1880 the 5th Admin Bn was consolidated as a new 6th Yorkshire (West Riding) RVC. Similarly, the 2nd Admin Bn at Skipton-in-Craven was consolidated as a new 9th Yorkshire (West Riding) RVC in 1880.

==Childers Reforms of 1881==
The Childers Reforms (and as a continuation of the Cardwell Reforms) brought the Militia into the regimental system, and the two battalions of 6th West York Militia became the 3rd and 4th Battalions of the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s. The Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment (33rd) was amalgamated with the 76th to become the 1st and 2nd Battalions.

At the same time the three West Riding Volunteer battalions became linked with the regiment. In February 1883, as part of the Childers Reforms, these three corps were designated as the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Volunteer Battalions of the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment. By 1887 they had adopted the same uniform as the parent unit. Under the mobilisation scheme introduced by the Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888 the Volunteer Battalions of the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s were assigned to the West Yorkshire Volunteer Infantry Brigade in Northern Command and in the event of war were expected to mobilise at Leeds.

==Duties of Empire (1881–1914)==

The 2nd battalion was stationed at the Imperial fortress of Bermuda from 1886 and then transferred to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1888, and then to the West Indies in 1891. In April 1893 the battalion, under Lt-Col. E. Nesbitt, set sail for the Cape Colony, posting one company on St Helena en route. In October a detachment of 3 officers and 51 NCOs and men were despatched up-country to serve with the Bechuanaland Border Police in the Matabele Uprising, in a complicated arrangement due to the fact that the BPP was at the time run by the British South Africa Company.

Some detachments of the battalion stayed on to serve in the Second Matabele War (1896–1897), being stationed in the colony of Natal in between. 13 officers and 320 NCOs and men proceeded on active service. Some served on the staff, some with mounted infantry, some with the Matabeleland Relief Force and other service companies. The battalion was sent to India in 1897.

The regiment began the first year of the 20th century at war when both battalions met in South Africa, as reinforcements for British forces fighting Boers, in the Second Boer War. The 1st battalion had arrived there before war started in 1899, the 2nd battalion arrived in early 1900, and took part in the Relief of Kimberley, in February 1900, which had been under siege by the Boers since October 1899. The battalion also took part in the Battle of Paardeberg.

The 3rd (Militia) Battalion (the former 6th West York Militia) was embodied in January 1900 for service in South Africa, and 500 officers and men left Queenstown for Cape Town the following month. Most of the battalion returned to the United Kingdom in late May 1902.

All three Volunteer Battalions also sent service companies to support the Regular battalions, and received the Battle Honour South Africa 1900–1902.

Following the end of the war in South Africa, the 1st battalion returned to York, while the 2nd battalion went to British India, first to Rangoon then in late 1902 to Lebong in Bengal.

==Territorial Force==
When the Territorial Force (TF) was formed under the Haldane Reforms in 1908, Volunteer Battalions were renumbered as battalions of their parent regiments. The Duke of Wellington&#x27;s 1st VB became the 4th Battalion, (4DWR), at Prescott Street in Halifax. The 2nd VB formed two new battalions: the 5th Battalion, (5DWR), at St Paul&#x27;s Street in Huddersfield, and the 7th Battalion, (7DWR), at Scar Lane in Milnsbridge. The 3rd VB became the 6th Battalion, (6DWR), at Otley Road in Skipton. The former West Yorkshire Brigade was split in two, and the four TF battalions of the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment composed the new 2nd West Riding Brigade in the West Riding Division.

==First World War==

===Regular Army===
The 1st Battalion remained in India throughout the war, serving first with the 2nd (Rawalpindi) Division and then with the 1st (Peshawar) Division.
The 2nd Battalion landed at Le Havre as part of the 13th Brigade in the 5th Division in August 1914 for service on the Western Front. It first saw action at the Battle of Mons. It then fought a rearguard action at the Battle of Le Cateau, an action during the retreat from Mons. The 2nd Battalion also fought at the First Battle of the Marne, the Battle of the Aisne, the Battle of La Bassée and the brutal first Battle of Ypres. The 2nd Battalion was also at the Battle of Hill 60 during which the British launched a massive bombardment, followed by an assault that led to vicious hand-to-hand fighting. The 8th Battalion saw service in the Gallipoli Campaign and the 10th Battalion was in action at Piave in Italy.

===Territorial Force===
The 1/4th, 1/5th, 1/6th and 1/7th battalions landed in France as part of the 147th (2nd West Riding) Brigade in the 49th (West Riding) Division in April 1915 for service on the Western Front and served together until the Armistice in November 1918. They saw action on the Somme, at Ypres, during the German spring offensive and the final Allied Hundred Days Offensive.
In August 1914 the Territorial Force formed 2nd Line units, distinguished from the 1st Line by the addition of &#x27;2/&#x27; to the battalion number, the parent units taking &#x27;1/&#x27;. The 2/4th, 2/5th, 2/6th and 2/7th Battalions of the Duke of Wellingtons formed 186th (2/2nd West Riding) Brigade in 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division. The division&#x27;s training was hampered by the lack of equipment and by the need to provide drafts to the 1st Line units serving overseas, but finally landed in France in January 1917 and served on the Western Front until the Armistice. It fought at Arras, Cambrai, in the Spring Offensive and the Hundred Days, and was the only TF division selected to form part of the Allied occupation force in the Rhineland after the war.
The Territorial Force battalions also formed 3rd Line units, which remained in the UK training and supplying drafts for the battalions overseas.

===New Armies===
The 8th (Service) Battalion landed at Suvla Bay in Gallipoli as part of the 32nd Brigade in the 11th (Northern) Division in August 1915; the battalion was evacuated in January 1916 and moved to France in July 1916 for service on the Western Front. The 9th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 52nd Brigade in the 17th (Northern) Division in July 1915 also for service on the Western Front while the 10th (Service) Battalion landed at Le Havre as part of the 69th Brigade in the 23rd Division in August 1915 also for service on the Western Front.

==Inter-war (1919–1938)==
In 1919, the 1st Battalion took part in the Third Anglo-Afghan War and eventually returned home in 1921. Meanwhile, the regiment&#x27;s title altered slightly in 1921 to Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment (West Riding).

In the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain&#x27;s cities was addressed by converting a number of TA infantry battalions into searchlight battalions of the Royal Engineers (RE). The 5th Duke of Wellington&#x27;s was one unit selected for this role, becoming 43rd (5th Duke of Wellington&#x27;s) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, Royal Engineers (5DWR) in 1936, retaining its Duke of Wellington&#x27;s cap badge.

In 1938, the 4th Battalion at Halifax was converted into 58th (Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery (4DWR). A duplicate unit, the 68th Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery was formed in 1939, with headquarters at Cleckheaton.

==Second World War==

===1st Battalion===
The Second World War was declared on 3 September 1939, and the 1st Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Edmund Charles Beard, was immediately sent to France as part of the 3rd Infantry Brigade of the 1st Infantry Division of 1st Corps of the BEF. During the retreat to Dunkirk, the &#x27;Dukes&#x27; formed part of the rearguard.

The &#x27;Dukes&#x27; fought in the North African Campaign, fighting with distinction in a number of actions and gaining several Battle Honours, as part of the 3rd Infantry Brigade. They fought at the Battle of Medjez Plain and the Battle of Banana Ridge and in the Battle of Djebel bou Aoukaz. The &quot;Bou&quot; was a ridge dominating the Medjez el Bab to Tunis road.

The &#x27;Dukes&#x27; also fought in the Italian Campaign. They took part in the Anzio Campaign, in an attempt to outflank the Gustav Line and force a German retreat from Monte Cassino. The &#x27;Dukes&#x27; fought with distinction at the Battle of Monte Cece in October 1944 where Captain Arthur Burns was awarded a DSO and Private Richard Henry Burton of the 1st Battalion was awarded a Victoria Cross for his courageous action in the battle.

===2nd Battalion===
In the Far East, the 2nd Battalion took part in the rearguard action at the Battle of Sittang Bridge in February 1942. They were trained as Chindits, to operate behind Japanese lines, who were at that time attacking India, they were formed into two columns, the 33rd and 76th, to operate behind the Japanese lines during the fierce battles for Imphal and Kohima.

===58th (Duke of Wellington&#x27;s) Anti-Tank Regiment===
The regiment served in North Africa, Italy, Greece and Austria during the war.

===43rd AA (5th Duke of Wellington&#x27;s) Battalion===
::&quot;See main article Huddersfield Rifles&quot;
43rd AA Battalion served in 31st (North Midland) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, protecting West Yorkshire during the Blitz. In 1940 the RE AA battalions were transferred to the Royal Artillery, and it became the 43rd (5th Duke of Wellington&#x27;s) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery.

In 1944 the regiment was assigned to 21st Army Group preparing for the Normandy Campaign. In the event, the regiment did not take part. However, by the autumn of 1944, the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was suffering from such shortages of pilots, aircraft and fuel that serious aerial attacks on the UK could be discounted. At the same time 21st Army Group was experiencing a severe manpower shortage, particularly among the infantry. The War Office began to reorganise surplus AA regiments in the UK into infantry units, primarily for duties in the rear areas, thereby releasing trained infantry for frontline service. On 1 October 1944, 43rd S/L Rgt was converted into 43rd (5th Bn Duke of Wellington&#x27;s) Garrison Regiment, RA. A month later, it was reorganised as an infantry battalion and redesignated 600th Regiment RA (5th Bn Duke of Wellington&#x27;s). It was the first such RA infantry regiment formed, and was sent to join Second Army in NW Europe for line of communication duties. The unit was placed in &#x27;suspended animation&#x27; in February 1945 and its personnel drafted to other units.

===1/6th and 1/7th battalions===
The 1/6th and 1/7th battalions of the regiment were both assigned to the 147th Infantry Brigade, alongside the 1/5th West Yorkshire Regiment, which itself was part of the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division. The brigade did not see service with the rest of the division in the Norwegian Campaign, but were instead sent to Iceland after it was invaded in 1940, and remained there until May 1942 when it was transferred back to the United Kingdom. On 28 February 1943, both 2/6DWR and 2/7DWR battalions had been dissolved and the 1/6DWR and 1/7DWR battalions dropped the /prefix, becoming, simply, (6DWR) and (7DWR) respectively. They both landed in Normandy on 12 June 1944 shortly after the D-Day landings of 6 June. They fought in the Battle of Normandy as part of the British Second Army in its attempts to capture the city of Caen. In particular, the 6th Battalion was severely mauled during Operation Martlet and, due to the heavy casualties sustained, was returned to the United Kingdom and disbanded, most of its men being sent to the 7th Battalion. They were replaced in the brigade by the 1st Battalion, Leicestershire Regiment. The 7th Battalion continued to fight in the Normandy Campaign in the Second Battle of the Odon, and clearing the Channel Ports in Operation Astonia.
After the failure of Operation Market Garden, the 7th Battalion was stationed at the Nijmegen bridgehead, in late November, and around Haalderen. Just after midnight of 1 December the battalion was being hit by heavy artillery, mortar and Spandau fire. As the night progressed they came under attack from multiple infantry elements of the German 6th Parachute Division in an attempt to capture the Nijmegen bridge. Fighting intensified, taking in house to house fighting throughout Haalderen and Gendt During the nights of 3–4 December, with small arms and grenades, with the Dukes &#x27;A Company&#x27; Headquarters in the village school. Fighting was very confused and movement limited due to heavy flooding of the ground from the breached canals and river. A German officer, 2nd Lieutenant Heinich, 5 Coy 16 Parachute Regiment, was captured by members of &#x27;B&#x27; company, who were laying trip flares. Major Denis Hamilton (who was in temporary command of the battalion) quickly organised a defence, using his Bren Gun Carriers, to hold back the Germans. Over 100 prisoners, with a further 50 killed or wounded were taken from the 5th, 7th and 10th companies of the German 16 Para Regiment. By 6 December the attack had died out and the &#x27;Dukes&#x27; were relieved by the 11th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers. 7DWR moved into reserve in Bemmel where they received sporadic shelling from heavy artillery, whilst putting out patrols to guard against a potential waterborne attack on the Nijmegen bridge. The next notable service seen by the battalion was in the Liberation of Arnhem in April 1945, shortly before Victory in Europe Day.

===2/6th and 2/7th battalions===
Throughout the spring and summer of 1939, the Territorial Army was ordered to expand in size and double its strength by creating duplicate units and, as a result, the 6th and 7th battalions created duplicate units, the 2/6th and 2/7th battalions. Both battalions became part of the 137th Infantry Brigade, attached to the 46th (West Riding and North Midland) Infantry Division and were sent overseas to France in April 1940 to join the British Expeditionary Force. Poorly trained and equipped, both battalions were battered during the German Army&#x27;s blitzkrieg during the Battle of France and were forced to retreat to Dunkirk and be evacuated to England. The battalions spent the next two years on home defence, preparing for a German invasion which never arrived. In July 1942 these battalions were transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps and converted to armour as 114 RAC and 115 RAC. They continued to wear their Duke&#x27;s badge on the black beret of the Royal Armoured Corps.

===8th Battalion===
The regiment&#x27;s 8th Battalion was raised in July 1940 and in 1941 it was also converted to a tank unit becoming 145th Regiment RAC (8DWR). The regiment served in 21st Army Tank Brigade, equipped with Churchill tanks. It joined 1st Army in Algeria, North Africa and was transferred to 25th Army Tank Brigade in support of 24 Guards Brigade (1st Division) on the push through Casablanca and Oran to Tunisia. It was one of the units in support of the Dukes 1st Battalion and the Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) at the Battle of Banana Ridge, overlooking the Medjez el Bab plain, as the front part of a five-mile-wide divisional offensive to advance on Tunis. The battle on the ridge resulted in the 1st Dukes and the QLR&#x27;s being the only units to be award the battle honour Banana Ridge. A following battle resulted in the award of the battle honour Djebel Bou Aoukaz on the 1st Dukes, the 1st King&#x27;s Shropshire Light Infantry and 145th Regiment RAC (8DWR).

===9th Battalion===
The 9th Battalion was also converted to armour, becoming 146th Regiment RAC (DWR).

==Postwar==
When the TA was reformed in 1947, the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions became the 382nd (Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment) Anti-Tank Regiment (later Medium Regiment), 578th (5th Bn, The Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, and 673rd (Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment respectively of the Royal Artillery. In 1955 the three regiments merged into the 382nd, each providing one battery. In 1957 some of the 5th Bn battery transferred to the 7th Bn (still in the infantry role) and formed the 5/7th Bn, thereby bringing together both parts of the former 2nd Volunteer Bn. Finally, in 1961, the rest of 382 Rgt converted to infantry and merged with the 5/7th Bn, bringing together all four Territorial battalions of the regiment as the West Riding Battalion, which in 1967 became part of the Yorkshire Volunteers.

==Korean War (1952–1956)==
The 1st Battalion was deployed to Korea in 1952, two years after the Korean War had broken out. They were part of the 1st Commonwealth Division.

===Battle of The Hook===

In 1953, the 1st Battalion relieved the Black Watch, who had been defending a position known as The Hook, a crescent shaped ridge, which was of tactical importance in the Commonwealth sector. The third Battle of the Hook began on 28 May. An initial bombardment of the British positions took place, with the Chinese forces charging the forward British positions once the bombardment ceased. The fighting that ensued was bloody and more akin to the battles that the &#x27;Dukes&#x27; had fought in the First World War. Shells were now raining down on the Hook from artillery and mortars, from both the Chinese and UN forces. The Chinese launched a second attack but were cut down by heavy fire from the UN forces. Further attacks occurred on 28 May, but all were defeated in heavy fighting. Just 30 minutes into 29 May, the Chinese forces launched another attack but, as before, they were beaten back. Alma Company of &#x27;The &#x27;Dukes&#x27; then began advancing up the line of the original trenches to dislodge the remaining Chinese forces in the forward trenches. The &#x27;Dukes&#x27; secured the Hook at 3:30 a.m. The &#x27;Dukes&#x27; losses were three officers and 17 other ranks killed and two officers and 84 other ranks wounded, plus 20 other ranks missing.

The &#x27;Dukes&#x27; embarked for Gibraltar on 13 November 1953, arriving on 10 December. In May 1954, during a visit to Gibraltar by Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh, the Commanding Officer of the &#x27;Dukes&#x27; (Lieutenant Colonel FR St P Bunbury) and a further 10 officers and other ranks received decorations for their actions in Korea.

==Post-Korean War (1956–2006)==

===Garrison duties===
After the bloody encounters in the Korean War, the &#x27;Dukes&#x27; were occupied by a series of garrison duties. The &#x27;Dukes&#x27; were first deployed to Gibraltar, then to Cyprus in 1956, where they participated in anti-terrorist operations against EOKA. The following year, the &#x27;Dukes&#x27; deployed to Northern Ireland. They moved back to the mainland in 1959, joining the new UK Strategic Reserve, as part of 19 Infantry Brigade. On 6 August 1959 the Regimental Depot, at Wellesley Barracks, was closed down. training of new recruits was undertaken at the Kings Division depot at Strensall Barracks.
The &#x27;Dukes&#x27; returned to the UK in 1970. Then deployed to Northern Ireland a number of times during The Troubles. In one deployment in 1972 three soldiers were killed.

In 1983 they provided the garrison regiment in Gibraltar.
In 1985, the &#x27;Dukes&#x27; deployed to Belize for a six-month tour of duty, taking part in operation &#x27;Holdfast&#x27;. In 1987 the &#x27;Dukes&#x27; deployed again to Northern Ireland for a two-year tour, based in Palace Barracks, just outside the City of Belfast.

===Bosnia (1994–1995)===
In March 1994, the &#x27;Dukes&#x27; deployed to Bosnia, with an area of responsibility covering Bugojno, Vitez, Travnik and the besieged enclave of Goražde. The latter was under siege for much of the war. It was declared a UN Safe Zone in that year. The &#x27;Dukes&#x27; were one of the first units to enter the town. The regiment pushed the Bosnian-Serb Army from their positions around the town to a distance of over one mile. Their objective in doing this was to create a safe zone for the town. While at Goražde, Private Shaun Taylor of C Company was killed during an engagement with Bosnian-Serb forces while manning an observation post. The engagement lasted fifteen minutes, with over 2,000 rounds of ammunition being expended by the &#x27;Dukes&#x27;. Seven of the Bosnian-Serb soldiers were killed in the fire-fight. Goražde remained a safe zone, being held by British troops from 1994 to 1995. It was the only safe zone to survive the war and avoided the tragedies that occurred in other UN safe zones such as Srebrenica and Žepa.
Corporal Wayne Mills of the 1st Battalion became the first recipient of the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross, second only to the Victoria Cross. On (29 April 1994), a patrol led by Corporal Mills came under heavy small-arms fire from a group of Bosnian Serbs. The patrol returned fire, killing two of the attackers. The patrol then withdrew, but the attackers persisted in firing on the patrol. The patrol soon reached an open clearing, where it was obvious they would be highly vulnerable to fire from the attackers. Corporal Mills then performed an astonishing feat of bravery. He turned back and engaged the group in a fire-fight, delaying the attackers long enough to allow the rest of his patrol to cross the clearing. While doing this brave act, Corporal Mills shot the leader of the group, with the rest scattering into the woods. Due to that action he returned to his patrol safely, who were giving covering fire.

Lieutenant-Colonel David Santa-Olalla received the Distinguished Service Order for his inspirational leadership and courage during the &#x27;Dukes&#x27; deployment to Bosnia. He arranged for the mutual withdrawal of both Serbian and Muslim forces, from the besieged town of Goražde, just as the Geneva talks were being held on the town.

===1995–2005===
In March 1995, the &#x27;Dukes&#x27; were again posted to Northern Ireland for a two-year tour of duty. In March 1997, a composite company from the 1st Battalion was deployed to the Falkland Islands. In 1998, C Company deployed for a tour of duty in South Armagh. During the period 1998–2000, the 1st Battalion served as a public duties unit in London.

In February 2001, a company from the &#x27;Dukes&#x27; deployed to Kosovo, with the objective of preventing arms and munitions being transported from Albania into Kosovo, then onto the Former Yugolav Republic Of Macedonia, now known as the Republic of Macedonia.

In 2003, the &#x27;Dukes&#x27; were part of Operation Telic, the invasion of Iraq, as part of 1 (United Kingdom) Armoured Division. The &#x27;Dukes&#x27; returned, as part of 4 (Armoured) Brigade, to the South-East of Iraq, in October 2004, to join the British-led Multi-National Division (South-East), as a fully equipped armoured infantry battalion with Warrior Armoured Personnel Carriers.


During 2003, in Osnabrück, Germany, where the &#x27;Dukes&#x27; were then based, the regiment celebrated its 300th year in existence. Over 2000 past and present members converged on the town to take part in the celebrations. The &#x27;Dukes&#x27; were presented with new colours by HM Queen Elizabeth II, represented by The Colonel of The Regiment Major-General Sir Evelyn John Webb-Carter KCB, due to the ill health of the Queen&#x27;s representative, the regiment&#x27;s Colonel-in-Chief the Duke of Wellington.

The regiment had a beer called Havercake Ale named in their honour by the Timothy Taylor Brewery, Keighley, to mark the regiment&#x27;s tercentenary. Timothy Taylor, the founder of the brewery, had served in an antecedent unit of the regiment during 1859. Since then other members of the family and employees had also enlisted as a &#x27;Duke&#x27;.

On 12 November 2005, the regiment was awarded the &quot;Keys to the Town&quot; of Erquinghem-Lys in France.

===Amalgamation===
In December 2004, as part of the re-organisation of the infantry, it was announced that the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment would be amalgamated with the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Regiment of Yorkshire and the Green Howards&#x27;, all Yorkshire-based regiments in the King&#x27;s Division, to form the Yorkshire Regiment. The re-badging parade took place on 6 June 2006.

The &#x27;Dukes&#x27; had five companies, named to commemorate five significant campaigns and battles, in which the Dukes took part and were awarded a Battle honour, which have been retained by the battalion in the Yorkshire Regiment:
:A Company — Alma — commemorating the Battle of Alma, during the Crimean War 1853–1856
:B Company — Burma — commemorating the Burma Campaign, during the Second World War 1941–1944
:C Company — Corunna — commemorating the Battle of Corunna, during the Peninsular War of 1809–1813
:Support Company — Somme — commemorating the Battle of the Somme, during the First World War 1914–1918
:Headquarter Company — Hook — commemorating the Battle of the Hook, during the Korean war 1952–1953

When required an additional rifle company was formed:- D Company — Dettingen — commemorating the Battle of Dettingen, during the War of the Austrian Succession in 1743 and an additional administration company:- W Company — Waterloo — commemorating the Battle of Waterloo, during the Waterloo campaign in 1815. Both companies having previously existed during the Dukes existence.

=== 9th Battalion Veterans Annual reunion ===
For 65 years, Captain Sir Tom Moore organised the annual reunion for the 9th Battalion veterans.

==Regimental colours==
The Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment had four colours on parade. The first pair of colours were the standard set of Regulation Colours, which all Regiments are presented with. The second pair was a set of Honorary Colours, which were originally presented to the 76th Regiment of Foot in 1808 for their actions during the Battle of Ally Ghur and Delhi in 1803.
The Honorary Colours were approximately 6-foot 6 inch by 6-foot. Following rebadging, on 6 June 2006, the 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment (Duke of Wellington&#x27;s) inherited responsibility for parading the Honorary Colours. On 31 March 2007 the Regulation colours were taken out of service and laid up in Halifax Parish church. There was a short ceremony in the church grounds where the troops were inspected by the Mayor of Halifax, Councillor Colin Stout, and the Lord Lieutenant of West Yorkshire Dr Ingrid Roscoe.

==Uniforms==
On formation in 1702 as the Earl of Huntingdon&#x27;s Regiment a red coat lined with yellow was worn, together with yellow breeches. Later in the 18th Century the coats had red facings but white linings which showed in the turn-backed skirts. For the remainder of its history the regiment was unusual in that the collars, cuffs and shoulder straps of its red coats were also red (most British regiments had facings of contrasting colours). This continued to be the case with the scarlet tunic worn by all ranks in full dress until 1914 and by bandsmen until amalgamation (see illustrations above). Officers were distinguished by silver buttons and braid until 1830 and thereafter by gold. After 1893 the badge of the Duke of Wellington was worn.

==Sport==
The &#x27;Dukes&#x27; had a long and proud Rugby tradition. They produced in their history 11 international players, 7 English, 1 Irish and 3 Scottish, with over 50 players capped for the army against the Navy &amp; Air Force since 1914.

For Rugby union they list:- Capt (Bull) Faithfull, England (3 Caps) 1924. Lieutenant WF (Horsey) Brown, Army &amp; Ireland (12 Caps), 1925–1928. Captain Mike Campbell-Lamerton, Army, London Scottish, Scotland (23 Caps), British Lions in South Africa in 1962, Captain of the British Lions in Australia &amp; New Zealand in 1966. Lieutenant CF Grieve and FJ Reynolds Toured South Africa in 1938 with the British Lions. In the early 1950s DW Shuttleworth and EMP Hardy provided the Half back pairing for England. Corporals Waqabaca and Ponjiasi played for Fiji. Brigadier DW Shuttleworth became the President of the English Rugby Football Union during the 1985/86 season. In 1957–1959, whilst stationed in Northern Ireland, the &#x27;Dukes&#x27; played rugby throughout Ulster. At the end of the tour the Ulster Team honoured the regiment by playing them at Ravenhill, with the &#x27;Dukes&#x27; winning 19 – 8. In 1960 during an emergency posting to Kenya the Kenyan Champions Nakuru heard the Dukes were there and challenged them to a match. The Kenya Regiment loaned them their team strip to wear. The &#x27;Dukes&#x27; won the match.

The regiment&#x27;s rugby league internationals include: Brian Curry, England, 1956; Norman Field, GB, 1963; Roy Sabine, GB; Jack Scroby, Army 1959, GB Halifax &amp; Bradford Northern; Charlie Renilson, Scotland, GB, 1965 and Arthur &#x27;Ollie&#x27; Keegan, GB.

<text>The 76th Regiment of Foot was a British Army regiment, raised in 1787. Under the Childers Reforms it amalgamated with the 33rd (Duke of Wellington&#x27;s) Regiment to form the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment in 1881.

==History==
===Formation===
The regiment was raised by Sir Thomas Musgrave, 7th Baronet for service in India as the 76th Regiment of Foot in October 1787. In accordance with the Declaratory Act 1788 the cost of raising the regiment was recharged to East India Company on the basis that the act required that expenses &quot;should be defrayed out of the revenues&quot; arising there. The majority of recruits were raised from Nottingham and Leicestershire, but many of them also came from the Musgrave family estates around Hayton Castle, near Aspatria, Cumbria.

The Royal Warrant for their raising was issued on 12 October 1787 and read:

GEORGE R.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Whereas We have thought fit to order a Regt of Foot to be&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;forthwith raised under your Command, which is to consist of ten&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Companies, with 3 Sergts, 4 Corpls, 2 Drumrs &amp; 71 private Men&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;in each, with two Fifers to the Grenadier Compy and one&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Compy, of 8 Sergts, 8 Corpls, 4 Drumrs &amp; 30 private Men with&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;the usuals Comd. Officers, these are to authorise you by Beat of&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Drum or otherwise to raise so many Men in any Country or part&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;of our Kingdom of Great Britain as shall be wanted to complete&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;the said Regt, to the above mentioned numbers. And all above&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Given the 12th October. 1787 in the 27th Year of Our Reign.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;By H.M.&#x27;s Command (Sd.) Geo. Yonge&quot;

===India===

The regiment embarked for India in 1788 for service in the Third Anglo-Mysore War and saw action at the Siege of Bangalore in February 1791 and the Siege of Seringapatam in February 1792. The regiment also saw service in the Second Anglo-Maratha War and fought at the Siege of Aligarh in September 1803. The regiment laid siege to Aligarh Fort, a fort commanded by a French mercenary officer Pierre Perron and captured it from the Marathas. The French prepared for the siege by lining 14 ditches around the fort with sword-blades and poisoned chevaux-de-frise. The walls were reinforced with French artillery, and the French also used tigers and lions of Scindia&#x27;s menagerie. During the battle, the British lost as many as 900 soldiers. The regiment went on to fight at the Battle of Delhi in September 1803, the Battle of Laswari in November 1803, and the Battle of Deeg in November 1804. For their distinguished service in these actions, King George III authorized the regiment to have the word &quot;Hindoostan&quot; emblazoned upon the regimental colours, along with an elephant badge with a howdah atop the elephant, also inscribed with the word &quot;Hindoostan&quot;. The regiment returned to England and became the 76th (Hindoostan) Regiment of Foot in October 1806.

===Napoleonic Wars===

In 1807, the regiment was deployed to Jersey in the Channel Islands for garrison duty, remaining there until 1808, when it was deployed to Spain to take part in the Peninsular War. The regiment took part in the Battle of Corunna in January 1809 and was evacuated from the Peninsula later that month. The regiment took part in the disastrous Walcheren Campaign in autumn 1809 and, having reverted to the title of 76th Regiment of Foot in 1812, returned to the Peninsula in 1813 seeing action at the Battle of Nivelle in November 1813 and the Battle of the Nive in December 1813. It then embarked for North America for service in the War of 1812 and saw action at the Battle of Plattsburgh in September 1814.

===The Victorian era===

The regiment did not return from North America until 1827. It was garrisoned in Ireland until 1834 when it departed for the West Indies. It went to the Bermuda Garrison in British North America, and on to Canada in 1841 before returning home in 1842. The regiment were deployed to South Wales later in the year to help suppress the Rebecca Riots. After that the regiment went to Corfu in 1848 and on to Malta in 1850 before sailing for Saint John, New Brunswick in March 1853. It was garrisoned at Fredericton in New Brunswick before embarking for home again in September 1857. It embarked for India in September 1863 and was stationed in Fort St. George, Madras before moving on to Burma in January 1868, returning to India again in 1870 and sailing for England in 1876.

As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 76th was linked with the 33rd (Duke of Wellington&#x27;s) Regiment, and assigned to district no. 9 at Wellesley Barracks in Halifax. On 1 July 1881 the Childers Reforms came into effect and the regiment amalgamated with the 33rd (Duke of Wellington&#x27;s) Regiment to form the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment.

<doc id="473367" wikidata="Q543849" url="?curid=473367" title="Rhetorical criticism">
<text>Rhetorical criticism analyzes the symbolic artifacts of discourse—the words, phrases, images, gestures, performances, texts, films, etc. that people use to communicate. Rhetorical analysis shows how the artifacts work, how well they work, and how the artifacts, as discourse, inform and instruct, entertain and arouse, and convince and persuade the audience; as such, discourse includes the possibility of morally improving the reader, the viewer, and the listener. Rhetorical criticism studies and analyzes the purpose of the words, sights, and sounds that are the symbolic artifacts used for communications among people.

The arts of Rhetorical criticism are an intellectual practice that dates from the time of Plato, in Classical Greece (5th–4th c. BC). Moreover, in the dialogue &quot;Phaedrus&quot; (c. 370 BC), the philosopher Socrates analyzes a speech by Lysias (230e–235e) the logographer (speech writer) to determine whether or not it is praiseworthy.

The academic purpose of Rhetorical criticism is greater understanding and appreciation in human relations:

== Rhetorical analysis ==

What is called &quot;rhetorical criticism&quot; in the Speech Communication discipline is often called &quot;rhetorical analysis&quot; in English. Through this analytical process, an analyst defines, classifies, analyzes, interprets and evaluates a rhetorical artifact. Through this process a critic explores, by means of various approaches, the manifest and latent meaning of a piece of rhetoric thereby offering further insight into the field of rhetorical studies generally and into an artifact or rhetor specifically. Such an analysis, for example may reveal the particular motivations or ideologies of a rhetor, how he or she interprets the aspects of a rhetorical situation, or how cultural ideologies are manifested in an artifact. It could also demonstrate how the constraints of a particular situation shape the rhetoric that responds to it. Certain approaches also examine how rhetorical elements compare with the traditional elements of a narrative or drama.

=== Definition ===
Generally speaking, the average audience member lacks the knowledge or experience to recognize rhetoric at first glance. Therefore, one of the more important functions of rhetorical studies is to determine whether an artifact is inherently rhetorical. This involves the identification of the exigence, rhetor&#x27;s constraints, audience, and the artifact&#x27;s persuasive potential.

===Classification===
Criticism also classifies rhetorical discourses into generic categories either by explicit argumentation or as an implicit part of the critical process. For example, the evaluative standard that the rhetorician utilizes will undoubtedly be gleaned from other works of rhetoric and, thus, impose a certain category. The same can be said about the examples and experts quoted within the work of criticism.

Classical genres of rhetoric include apologia, epideictic, or jeremiad but have been expanded to encompass numerous other categories.

===Analysis===
Within the realm of rhetorical criticism, analysis involves examining structure and analyzing how the individual rhetorical and communicative elements work within the context of the artifact. Rhetorical criticism is an art that involves the rhetorician developing strong reasoning for their judgement. The rhetorician must act as a rhetorical critic of their own work, they must examine the necessity of their research as well as the analysis. A rhetorician must also be able to defend the method of their analysis and the accuracy of their research.

===Interpretation===
Closely related with analysis, interpretation widens the scope of the examination to include the historical and cultural context of the artifact. A rhetorician should, at this point, draw comparisons with other established works of rhetoric to determine how well the artifact fits into a particular category or if it redefines the constraints of that category as well as how the elements illuminate the motivation and perspectives of a rhetor. Rhetorical criticism can then be broken into judgment and understanding. Judgment is concerned with determining the effectiveness of the information and the strategies of presentation that leads to the success or failure of the artifact. The understanding is drawn from the acknowledgment and acceptance of what has been presented.

===Evaluation===
The purposes of rhetorical criticism fall within three evaluative categories: academic, ethical, and political. Academic purposes seek to further the process of rhetorical study. Ethical purposes attempt to reveal implicit cultural values or unethical manipulations. Political purposes involve revealing hegemonic power structures in order to expose oppressive discourses or give voice to marginalized groups. Rhetorical criticism has gained more recognition and importance in the past forty years, especially in the academic field. This increase in interest has led to colleges and universities devoting more courses to the study of rhetorical matters such as rhetorical criticism.

<text>Visual rhetoric is the art of effective communication through visual elements such as images, typography, and texts. Visual rhetoric encompasses the skill of visual literacy and the ability to analyze images for their form and meaning. Drawing on techniques from semiotics and rhetorical analysis, visual rhetoric expands on visual literacy as it examines the structure of an image with the focus on its persuasive effects on an audience.

Although visual rhetoric also involves typography and other texts, it concentrates mainly on the use of images or visual texts. Using images is central to visual rhetoric because these visuals help in either forming the case an image alone wants to convey, or arguing the point that a writer formulates, in the case of a multimodal text which combines image and written text, for example. Visual rhetoric has gained more notoriety as more recent scholarly work started exploring alternative media forms that include graphics, screen design, and other hybrid visual representations that does not privilege print culture and conventions. Also, visual rhetoric involves how writers arrange segments of a visual text on the page. In addition to that, visual rhetoric involves the selection of different fonts, contrastive colors, and graphs, among other elements, to shape a visual rhetoric text. One vital component of visual rhetoric is analyzing the visual text. The interactional and commonly hybrid nature of cyber spaces that usually mixes print text and visual images unable some detachment of them as isolated constructs, and scholarship has claimed that especially in virtual spaces where print text and visuals are usually combined, there is no place either for emphasizing one mode over another. One way of analyzing a visual text is to look for its significant meaning.

Simply put, the meaning should be deeper than the literal sense that a visual text holds. One way to analyze a visual text is to dissect it in order for the viewer to understand its tenor. Viewers can break the text into smaller parts and share perspectives to reach its meaning. In analyzing a text that includes an image of the bald eagle, as the main body of the visual text, questions of representation and connotation come into play. Analyzing a text that includes a photo, painting, or even cartoon of the bold eagle along with written words, would bring to mind the conceptions of strength and freedom, rather than the conception of merely a bird.

This includes an understanding of the creative and rhetorical choices made with coloring, shaping, and object placement. The power of imagery, iconic photographs, for instance, can potentially generate actions in a global scale. Rhetorical choices carry great significance that surpass reinforcement of the written text.  Each choice, be font, color, layout, represents a different message that author wants to portray for the audience. Visual rhetoric emphasizes images as sensory expressions of cultural and contextual meaning, as opposed to purely aesthetic consideration. Analyzing visuals and their power to convey messages is central to incorporating visual rhetoric within the digital era as nuances of choices regarding audience, purpose and genre can be analyzed within a single frame and the rationale behind designers’ rhetorical choices can be revealed and analyzed by how the elements of visuals play out altogether. Visual rhetoric has been approached and applied in a variety of academic fields including art history, linguistics, semiotics, cultural studies, business and technical communication, speech communication, and classical rhetoric. Visual rhetoric seeks to develop rhetorical theory in a way that is more comprehensive and inclusive with regard to images and their interpretations.

==History and origin ==
The term rhetoric originated in ancient Greece and its concept has been widely discussed for thousands of years. Sophists first coined the idea as an abstract term to help label the concept, while Aristotle more narrowly defined rhetoric as a message&#x27;s potential to influence audiences. Linguists and other researchers often define rhetoric through the well-known five canons of rhetoric. Over time, this definition has evolved, expanded, and raised serious debate as new digital mediums of communicating have developed.

In his book &quot;Elements of Criticism&quot;, rhetorician Lord Kames (also known as Henry Home) laid the groundwork for later rhetoricians by taking the controversial stance of including visual art in his theory of criticism. Kames argued many of the same points as other Enlightenment scholars—mainly that art was beneficial to the public—and worthy of note and praise—if it was encouraging a moral improvement of its audience.

French theorist Roland Barthes in 1977 brought to light a new way to evaluate other communication means, showing the relevance of traditional rhetorical theories to the still photographic medium. Barthes explained visual rhetoric generally as the implied and interpreted messages from the work, yet these bigger messages often extend beyond the initial superficial interpretation. Visual rhetoric uses a variety of tools to hook readers within its mediums (e.g. gifs). Although similar in nature, one striking difference between visual and classical rhetoric is the newfound outlook on Aristotle&#x27;s original canons. Linda Scott created a newfound audience by constructing new cannons exclusive to visual rhetoric. Instead of closely monitoring the content, as with the initial five canons, Scott&#x27;s focused on the visual medium&#x27;s ability to &quot;invent&quot; and argument, &quot;arrangement&quot; of the item, and all coupled with a meaningful &quot;delivery&quot; of presentation. Since its inception, popular studies have appeared in published works to discuss the role of visual rhetoric in many facets of human life, especially advertising.

The term emerged largely as an effort to set aside a certain area of study that would focus attention on specific rhetorical elements of visual mediums. Historically, the study of rhetoric has been geared toward linguistics. Visual symbols were deemed trivial and subservient and thus, were largely ignored as part of a rhetorical argument. As a result, modern rhetorical theory developed with a significant exclusion of these visual symbols, ignoring the field of visual rhetoric as a separate area of study. Scholars of visual rhetoric analyze photographs, drawings, paintings, graphs and tables, interior design and architecture, sculpture, Internet images, and film. From a rhetorical perspective, the focus is on the contextual response rather than the aesthetic response. An aesthetic response is a viewer&#x27;s direct perception with the sensory aspects of the visual, whereas with a rhetorical response, meaning is given to the visual. Every part of the artifact has significance in the message being conveyed; each line, each shading, each person has a purpose. As visual rhetoricians study images and symbols, their findings catalyze challenges to the linguistic meaning altogether, allowing a more holistic study of the rhetorical argument to emerge with the introduction of visual elements.

=== Composition ===
The field of composition studies has recently returned its attention to visual rhetoric. In an increasingly visual society, proponents of visual rhetoric in composition classes suggest that increased literacy requires writing and visual communication skills. In relation to visual rhetoric, the composition field positions itself, more broadly, into challenging reductive definitions of composing and rhetoric that gravitate toward verbal communication only. Touching upon rhetorical processes/decisions that affect a visual design is a venue for calling composition scholars’ attention of the function that arrangements of images and words play out in writing practices and thus communication, emphasizing the complex relationship between verbal and visual meanings. Visual communication skills relate to an understanding of the mediated nature of all communication, especially to an awareness of the act of representation. Visual rhetoric can be utilized in a composition classroom to assist with writing and rhetoric development. 
=== Semiotics ===
Semiotic theory is defined as a theory that seeks to describe the rhetorical significance of sign-making. The central idea of the theory is that a sign does not exist outside of a contextual experience, but it only exists in relation to other signs, objects, and entities. Therefore, the sign belongs to a larger system, and when taken out of context of other signs, is rendered meaningless and uncommunicable. The parts of a semiotic are divided into two parts: the material part of the sign is known as the &quot;form of expression,&quot; the meaning of the form of expression is known as &quot;form of content&quot;. In semiotic theory, the expression only has meaningful content when existing in a larger contextual framework.

=== Areas of focus ===
While studying visual objects, rhetorical scholars tend to have three areas of study: nature, function, or evaluation. Nature encompasses the literal components of the artifact. This is a primary focus of visual rhetoric because in order to understand the function of an image, it is necessary to understand the substantive and stylistic nature of the artifact itself. Function holds a somewhat literal definition—it represents the purpose an image serves for an audience. The function, or purpose, of an image may be to evoke a certain emotion. The evaluation of an artifact determines if the image serves its function.

== Rhetorical application ==
Visual rhetoric studies how humans use images to communicate. Elements of images, such as size color, line, and shape, are used to convey messages. In images, meanings are created by the layout and spatial positions of these elements. The entities that constitute an image are socially, politically, and culturally constructed. The same image may represent different rhetorical meanings depending on the audience. The choice and arrangement of the elements in an image should be used to achieve the desired rhetorical effects and convey messages accurately to specific audiences, societies, and cultures.

The use of images is a conscious, communicative decision as the colors, form, medium, and size are each chosen on purpose. However, a person may come in contact with a sign, but if they have no relation to the sign, its message is arbitrary. Therefore, in order for artifacts or products to be conceptualized as visual rhetoric, they must be symbolic, involve human intervention, and be presented to an audience for the purpose of communicating.

In &quot;The Rhetoric of the Image&quot;, Roland Barthes examines the semiotic nature of images, and the ways that images function to communicate specific messages. Barthes points out that messages transmitted by visual images include coded iconic and non-coded iconic linguistic messages. Visual rhetorical images can be categorized into two dimensions: meaning operation and visual structure. Meaning operation refers to the relations and connections between elements in visual images. Visual structure refers to the way that the elements are visually displayed.

=== Analysis terminology ===
Rhetorical critics have borrowed analysis terminology from C.S. Peirce to accomplish direct analysis of visual messages. Icon (or iconic signs), index (or indexical signs), and symbol (or symbolic signs) are three basic categories of recognizable characteristics of visual messages. Icons, or iconic signs, are recognized based on resemblance to known elements or items (e.g., one&#x27;s ID photo on a company badge). Indexes, or indexical signs, are recognized based on understanding of a visual trace, imprint, or element that signals prior activity, or process, the agent of which is no longer visible (e.g., tire tracks in the sand). Symbols, or symbolic signs, are recognized only on the basis of a shared, learned code of visual signs (e.g., a Mercedes Benz logo, or any printed word in any written language). These three types of visual signs individually, or in combination, make up the visual design elements of nearly all visual messages.

== Modern application ==
Visual images have always played a role in communication; however, the recent advancements in technology have enabled users to produce and share images on a mass scale. The mass communication of images has made spread of news and information a much quicker process. As a result, certain images may go &quot;viral&quot;, meaning the image may have been shared and seen by a large number of audiences, and attracted mainstream media attention. Images are utilized in a variety of ways for a number of purposes. From business to art to entertainment, the versatility of images in popular culture have some scholars arguing words will eventually become outdated.

=== Rhetorical analysis of an image ===

*Determine the &quot;audience&quot;, i.e. the intended readership/viewer of the text.
*Determine the &quot;purpose&quot;, i.e. the importance of the message behind the image.
*Determine the &quot;context&quot; and meaning(s) behind the image/text.

====Analyzing the design choices of an image====

* Emphasis: search for the &quot;stress&quot; of the image; where does the author/artist want the audience attention to go to?
* Contrast: search for the &quot;element&quot; that stands out in the image; where is the emphasis in the image?
* Color: helps the audience figure out the &quot;emphasis&quot; of an image. Why were certain colors used in this image? What do the choice of these colors tell us?
* Organization: the &quot;arrangement&quot; of elements that make the image a whole. How is the image organized? What does the organization of the image tell the audience?
* Alignment: the &quot;line up&quot; of the image. How does the alignment of the image control how the audiences&#x27; eyes view the image?
* Proximity: the &quot;space&quot; used (or not used) in an image. How close (or not so close) are the elements portrayed in the image? What meaning does that make?

=== Visual communication design ===
==== Method of appeal ====
Aristotle proposed three types of appeal to an audience:

* &quot;Ethos&quot; is the appeal to ethics or integrity.
* &quot;Pathos&quot; is the appeal to emotions
* &quot;Logos&quot; is the appeal to logic or reason

These techniques are a technical skill learned and utilized by visual communication designer&#x27;s today, such as in the field of advertising. Each of these methods of appeal have the ability to influence their audience in different ways. Methods of appeal can also be combined to strengthen the underlying message.

==== Visual literacy ====
Visual literacy is the ability to read, analyze, and evoke meaning from visual text through the means of &quot;visual grammar&quot;. Visual Communication Designers depend on their audience having visual literacy to comprehend their outputted materials.

==== Visual ethics ====
Research has shown that there are ethical implications to the presentation of visuals. &quot;Visuals present the risk of, all too easily, swaying their audiences in an unethical fashion.&quot; Advances in technology have made it easier to manipulate and distort visuals. Visual communicators are expected to accurately portray information and avoid misleading or deceiving viewers.

==== Advertisements ====
Advertisers know that their consumers are able to associate one thing to another; therefore, when an ad shows two things that seemingly different, they know that the consumer will find a connection between the two. Advertisers also find ways to make sure that the consumer creates a positive association between what they are selling and whatever they are associating their product with.

In advertising, there are nine main classifications for how ads incorporate visual rhetoric. These classifications vary in complexity with the least complex being when advertisers juxtapose their product with another image (listed as 1,2,3). After juxtaposition, the complexity is increased with fusion, which is when an advertiser&#x27;s product is combined with another image (listed as 4,5,6). The most complex is replacement, which replaces the product with another product (listed as 7,8,9). Each of these sections also include a variety of richness. The least rich would be connection, which shows how one product is associated with another product (listed as 1,4,7). The next rich would be similarity, which shows how a product is like another product or image (listed as 2,5,8,). Finally, the most rich would be opposition, which is when advertisers show how their product is not like another product or image (listed as 3,6,9). 
# Advertisers can put their product next to another image in order to have the consumer associate their product with the presented image.
# Advertisers can put their product next to another image to show the similarity between their product and the presented image.
# Advertisers can put their product next to another image in order to show the consumer that their product is nothing like what the image shows.
# Advertisers can combine their product with an image in order to have the consumer associate their product with the presented image.
# Advertisers can combine their product with an image to show the similarity between their product and the presented image.
# Advertisers can combine their product with another image in order to show the consumer that their product is nothing like what the image shows.
# Advertisers can replace their product with an image to have the consumer associate their product with the presented image.
# Advertisers can replace their product with an image to show the similarity between their product and the presented image.
# Advertisers can replace their product with another image to show the consumer that their product is nothing like what the image shows.

Each of these categories varies in complexity, where putting a product next to a chosen image is the simplest and replacing the product entirely is the most complex. The reason why putting a product next to a chosen image is the most simple is because the consumer has already been shown that there is a connection between the two. In other words, the consumer just has to figure out why there is the connection. However, when advertisers replace the product that they are selling with another image, then the consumer must first figure out the connection and figure out why the connection was made.

=== Visual arts ===
Visual tropes and tropic thinking are a part of visual rhetoric. While the field of visual rhetoric isn&#x27;t necessarily concerned with the aesthetic choices of a piece, the same principles of visual composition may be applied to the study and practice of visual art. For example, figures of speech, such as personification or allusion, may be implemented in the creation of an artwork. A painting may &quot;allude&quot; to peace with an olive branch or to Christianity with a cross; in the same way, an artwork may employ personification by attributing human qualities to a non-human entity. In general, however, visual art is a separate field of study than visual rhetoric.

=== Graffiti ===
Graffiti is a &quot;pictorial or visual inscription on a accessible surface.&quot; According to Hanauer, Graffiti achieves three functions; the first is to allow marginalized texts to participate in the public discourse, the second is that graffiti serves the purpose of expressing openly &quot;controversial contents&quot;, and the third is to allow &quot;marginal groups to the possibility of expressing themselves publicly.&quot; Bates and Martin note that this form of rhetoric has been around even in ancient Pompeii, with an example from 79 A.D. reading, &quot;Oh wall, so many men have come here to scrawl, I wonder that your burdened sides don&#x27;t fall&quot;. Gross and Gross indicated that graffiti is capable of serving a rhetorical purpose. Within a more modern context, Wiens&#x27; (2014) research showed that graffiti can be considered an alternative way of creating rhetorical meaning for issues such as homelessness. Furthermore, according to Ley and Cybriwsky graffiti can be an expression of territory, especially within the context of gangs. This form of visual rhetoric is meant to communicate meaning to anyone who so happens to see it, and due to its long history and prevalence, several styles and techniques have emerged to capture the attention of an audience.

=== Text ===
While visual rhetoric is usually applied to denote the non-textual artifacts, the use and presentation of words is still critical to understanding the visual argument as a whole. Beyond how a message is conveyed, the presentation of that message encompasses the study and practice of typography. Professionals in fields from graphic design to book publishing make deliberate choices about how a typeface looks, including but not limited to concerns of functionality, emotional evocations, and cultural context.
=== Memes ===
Though a relatively new way of using images, visual Internet memes are one of the more pervasive forms of visual rhetoric. Visual memes represent a genre of visual communication that often combines images and text to create meaning. Visual memes can be understood through visual rhetoric, which &quot;combines elements of the semiotic and discursive approaches to analyze the persuasive elements of visual texts.&quot; Furthermore, memes fit into this rhetorical category because of their persuasive nature and their ability &quot;to draw viewers into the argument&#x27;s construction via the viewer&#x27;s cognitive role in completing &quot;visual enthymemes&quot; to fill in the unstated premise.&quot; The visual portion of the meme is a part of its multimodal grammar, allowing a person to decode the text through &quot;cultural codes&quot; that contextualize the image to construct meaning. Because of what is unstated, memetic images can hold multiple interpretations. As groups create and share a specific meme template what is unstated becomes a fixed reading with &quot;novel expression&quot;.

Shifman, in an analysis of KnowYourMeme.com, found that popular memetic images often feature juxtaposition and frozen motion. Juxtaposition frames clashing visual elements in order to &quot;deepen the ridicule&quot; with a large incongruity or diminishes the original contrast by taking the visual object into a more fitting situation. Frozen motion pictures an action made static, leaving the viewer to complete the motion in order to complete the premise.

Considered by some scholars to be a subversive form of communication, memetic images have been used to unify political movements, such as umbrellas during the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong or the images of tea bags by the Tea Party Movement in 2009.

According to a 2013 study by Bauckhage, et al., the temporal nature of most memes and their &quot;hype cycles&quot; of popularity are in line with the behavior of a typical fad and suggest that after they proliferate and become mainstream, memes quickly lose their appeal and popularity. Once it has lost its appeal, a meme is pronounced &quot;dead&quot; to signify its overuse or mainstream appearance.

Among the intrinsic factors of memes that affect their potential rise to popularity is similarity. A 2014 study conducted by researcher Michele Coscia concluded that meme similarity has a negative correlation to meme popularity, and can therefore be used, along with factors like social network structure, to explain the popularity of various memes. A 2015 study by Mazambani et al. concluded that other factors of influence in meme spread within an online community include how relevant a meme is to the &quot;topic focus&quot; or theme of the online community as well as whether the posting user is in a position of power within an online setting. Memes that are consistent with a group&#x27;s theme and memes that originate from lower-status members within the group spread faster than memes that are inconsistent and are created by members of a group that are in positions of power.

Scholars like Jakub Nowak propose the idea of popular driven media as well. Successful memes originate and proliferate by means of anonymous internet users, not entities like corporations or political parties that have an agenda. For this reason, anonymity is linked to meme popularity and credibility. Nowak asserts that meme authorship should remain anonymous, because this is the only way to let people make the statements that they want to freely.

<doc id="473376" wikidata="Q1376849" url="?curid=473376" title="Jacob ben Asher">
<text>Jacob ben Asher (c. 1270–1340), also known as Ba&#x27;al ha-Turim as well as Yaakov ben haRosh, was an influential Medieval rabbinic authority. He is often referred to as the Ba&#x27;al ha-Turim (&quot;Author of the &quot;Turim&quot;&quot;), after his main work, the &quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim&quot; (&quot;Four Columns&quot;).

==Biography==
He was probably born in the Holy Roman Empire at Cologne about 1270 and probably died at Toledo, then in the Kingdom of Castile, in 1340.

He was the third son of the Asher ben Jehiel (known as the &quot;Rosh&quot;), a rabbi of the Holy Roman Empire who, in 1303, moved to Toledo in Castile, due to increasing persecution of Jews in his native Germany. Besides his father, who was his principal teacher, Jacob quotes very often in the &quot;Turim&quot; his elder brother Jehiel; once his brother Judah and once his uncle Chaim. 

Some say Jacob succeeded his father as the rabbi of the Jewish community of Toledo (Zacuto), while others say his brother Judah ben Asher did. His brothers were also rabbis of different communities in Iberia. He lived in abject poverty most of his life, and according to the Sephardic Community of Chios, is said to have fallen ill and died with his ten companions on the island of Chios, in Greece, whilst travelling.

==Works==
*&quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim,&quot; one of the most important halachic books of all time. The work was divided into four sections, each called a &quot;tur,&quot; alluding to the columns of jewels on the High Priest&#x27;s breastplate. 
*&quot;Sefer ha-Remazim,&quot; or &quot;Kitzur Piske ha-Rosh&quot; (Constantinople, 1575), an abridgment of his father&#x27;s compendium of the Talmud, in which he condensed his father&#x27;s decisions, omitting the casuistry.
*&quot;Rimzei Ba&#x27;al ha-Turim&quot; or &quot;Perush ha-Torah le-R. Ya&#x27;akov Ba&#x27;al ha-Turim&quot; (Constantinople, 1500 and 1514), a short commentary on the Pentateuch, (actually short appetizers that start each section of his actual Torah commentary) which is printed in virtually all Jewish editions of the Pentateuch. These appetizers consist of mystical and symbolical references in the Torah text (see Masoretic text), often using gematria and acronyms as well as other occurrences of particular words elsewhere in the Torah.
*&quot;Perush Al ha-Torah,&quot; the full commentary on the Pentateuch (Zolkiev, 1806). Its content is taken mainly from Nachmanides (often copied word-for-word), but without his cabalistic and philosophical interpretations. Jacob quotes many other commentators, among them Saadia Gaon, Rashi, Joseph Kara and Abraham ibn Ezra.

<text>was the smallest of the big three Japanese airlines. In contrast to the other two, JAL and ANA, JAS&#x27; international route network was very small, but its domestic network incorporated many smaller airports that were not served by the two larger airlines. As an independent company, it was last headquartered in the JAS M1 Building at Haneda Airport in Ōta, Tokyo. It has since merged with Japan Airlines.

JAS was famous for its variety of aircraft liveries; Amy Chavez of &quot;The Japan Times&quot; described the rainbow liveries as &quot;abstract.&quot; Many of its color schemes in the 1990s were designed by film director Akira Kurosawa.

The airline&#x27;s slogan was &quot;Good Speed Always&quot;.

==History==
===Formation===
The company was originally formed as (TDA) in a merger between Toa Airways and Japan Domestic Airlines on May 15, 1971. It adopted the Japan Air System (JAS) name on April 1, 1988.

===Start of international service===
In 1988, Japan Air System began service from Narita to Seoul, South Korea, and Taiwan, and by 1993 JAS was also flying to Singapore, Honolulu and Indonesia. In 1995 the airline had 99 domestic routes, some international routes, 64 offices in Japan, one office in Seoul, South Korea, and one office in Guangzhou, People&#x27;s Republic of China.

JAS entered into a partnership with Northwest Airlines in 1999 following several years of negotiations, allowing Northwest to codeshare on JAS domestic routes from Kansai Airport in Osaka and JAS to codeshare on Northwest flights between Japan and the US. On Northwest&#x27;s fifth freedom flights between Japan and Asia, JAS was limited to codesharing on Northwest routes that JAS also had the authority to fly, such as Tokyo-Seoul.

===Boeing 777 livery design contest===
In 1996, Japan Air System held a contest for designing the livery of the Boeing 777. The youngest entrant was three years of age while the oldest was 84. A total of 10,364 participants from 42 countries submitted entries. The judges included Akira Kurosawa, Masuo Ikeda, Kenshi Hirokane, Yoshiko Sakurai, and . Thirteen-year-old , a male second year (Grade 8) junior high school student living near Chitose Airport, won the award. The Japan Air System Boeing 777, painted in Watanabe&#x27;s design, premiered in April 1997 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Japan Air System.

===Merger with Japan Airlines===
JAS and Japan Airlines announced their merger in November 2001. It was the first major airline industry realignment in Japan in three decades, and partly a consequence of the slump in worldwide air traffic following the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. At the time, JAL had only a 25% share of the Japanese domestic air travel market, half that of rival All Nippon Airways, and saw the merger as a means of providing stronger competition to ANA domestically.

JAS and JAL prepared an integrated timetable in August 2002. On October 2, 2002, they established a new holding company, , with Isao Kaneko as CEO. A new &quot;Arc of the Sun&quot; livery for the JAL group was announced in September 2002 and the first aircraft with the livery rolled out in November. On April 1, 2004, Japan Airlines changed its name to &quot;Japan Airlines International&quot; and Japan Air System changed its name to Japan Airlines Domestic, officially ending the JAS brand. Japan Airlines Domestic was merged with Japan Airlines International on October 1, 2006, and disappeared both in name and reality.

At the time of its integration into JAL, JAS operated the Airbus A300, Boeing 777, MD-80 and MD-90. Most continued flying as part of the JAL fleet, but three A300s were scrapped at Sendai Airport in 2002, while two others were transferred to Fly Air in Turkey.

==Corporate affairs==

When Toa Domestic Airlines was originally established on May 15, 1971, its headquarters were located at the Japan Airlines Haneda Maintenance Center (羽田日本航空メンテナンスセンター &quot;Haneda Nihon Kōkū Mentanensu Sentā&quot;) at Tokyo International Airport (Haneda Airport) in Ōta, Tokyo. On February 28, 1972, its headquarters were moved to in Minato, Tokyo. On July 31, 1990, the headquarters moved from Mori Building No. 18 to , located in Toranomon. On April 18, 1998, the head office moved to at Haneda Airport. On August 11, 2003, as JAS was being merged into Japan Airlines, the JAS headquarters moved from Haneda Maintenance Center 1 to the JAL Building in Shinagawa, Tokyo.

==Subsidiaries==
Japan Air System had the following subsidiaries:
*Japan Air Commuter
*Hokkaido Air System
*Harlequin Air

==Fleet==

Japan Air System had formerly operated the following aircraft since it commenced operations:

==Credit cards==
In association with Visa, MasterCard, and Japan Credit Bureau JAS had &quot;JAS Card&quot; credit cards. In addition, JAS had &quot;Sky Merit&quot; cards.

==Accidents and incidents==
*July 3, 1971, Toa Domestic Airlines Flight 63: A NAMC YS-11A owned by Toa Domestic Airlines crashed into terrain, killing all 68 occupants.
*May 25, 1975: A NAMC YS-11A (JA8680) had a hydraulic oil leak and forced the crew to return to Osaka. During landing, one of the tires blew causing the aircraft to veer off the runway. The aircraft crossed a sod area and a drainage ditch. The cause of the oil leak was a loose connection of the hydraulic line in the left flap well.
*April 18, 1993, Japan Air System Flight 451: A McDonnell Douglas DC-9-41, flying from Nagoya to Hanamaki, crashed after the aircraft, caught by wind shear, skidded off of the runway. All of the passengers and crew survived.

*January 1, 2004, Japan Air System Flight 979: A McDonnell Douglas MD-81 (JA8297) sustained substantial damage in a landing gear accident at Tokunoshima. On landing, the aircraft&#x27;s left main landing gear collapsed during rollout and its left wing tip contacted the ground. The aircraft came to a stop on the runway. Three passengers were slightly injured.

==Special liveries==
Japan Air System, for a period, painted a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 in a Peter Pan color scheme.

<doc id="473383" wikidata="Q2533443" url="?curid=473383" title="Arba'ah Turim">
<text>Arba&#x27;ah Turim (), often called simply the Tur, is an important Halakhic code composed by Yaakov ben Asher (Cologne, 1270 – Toledo, Spain c. 1340, also referred to as &quot;Ba&#x27;al Ha-Turim&quot;). The four-part structure of the &quot;Tur&quot; and its division into chapters (&quot;simanim&quot;) were adopted by the later code Shulchan Aruch. This was the first book to be printed in Southeast Europe and the Near East.

== Meaning of the name ==

The title of the work in Hebrew means &quot;four rows&quot;, in allusion to the jewels on the High Priest&#x27;s breastplate. Each of the four divisions of the work is a &quot;Tur&quot;, so a particular passage may be cited as &quot;Tur Orach Chayim, siman 22&quot;, meaning &quot;Orach Chayim division, chapter 22&quot;. This was later misunderstood as meaning &quot;Tur, Orach Chayim, chapter 22&quot; (to distinguish it from the corresponding passage in the Shulchan Aruch), so that &quot;Tur&quot; came to be used as the title of the whole work.

== Arrangement and contents ==
The &quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim&quot;, as the name implies, consists of four divisions (&quot;Turim&quot;); these are further organised by topic and section (&quot;siman&quot;, pl. &quot;simanim&quot;).
:The four Turim are as follows:
:* Orach Chayim - laws of prayer and synagogue, Sabbath, holidays
:* Yoreh De&#x27;ah - miscellaneous ritualistic laws, such as shechita and kashrut
:* Even Ha&#x27;ezer - laws of marriage, divorce
:* Choshen Mishpat - laws of finance, financial responsibility, damages (personal and financial) and legal procedure

In the &quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim&quot;, Ya&#x27;akov ben Asher traces the practical Jewish law from the Torah text and the dicta of the Talmud through the &quot;Rishonim&quot;. He used the code of Isaac Alfasi as his starting point; these views are then compared to those of Maimonides, as well as to the Ashkenazi traditions contained in the Tosafist literature. Unlike Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;, the &quot;Tur&quot; is not limited to normative positions, but compares the various opinions on any disputed point. (In most instances of debate, Ya&#x27;akov ben Asher follows the opinion of his father Asher ben Jehiel, known as the &quot;Rosh&quot;.) &quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim&quot; also differs from the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;, in that, unlike Maimonides&#x27; work, it deals only with areas of Jewish law that are applicable in the Jewish exile.

== Later developments ==

The best-known commentary on the &quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim&quot; is the &quot;Beit Yosef&quot; by rabbi Joseph ben Ephraim Karo: this goes beyond the normal functions of a commentary, in that it attempts to review all the relevant authorities and come to a final decision on every point, so as to constitute a comprehensive resource on Jewish law. Other commentaries are &quot;Bayit Chadash&quot; by rabbi Joel Sirkis, &quot;Darkhei Moshe&quot; by Moses Isserles, &quot;Beit Yisrael (Perishah u-Derishah)&quot; by rabbi Joshua Falk, as well as works by a number of other &quot;Acharonim&quot;. These often defend the views of the Tur against the Beit Yosef.

The &quot;Tur&quot; continues to play an important role in Halakha.
* Joseph Caro&#x27;s &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, the fundamental work of &quot;Halakha&quot;, is a condensation of his &quot;Beit Yosef&quot; and follows the basic structure of the &quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim&quot;, including its division into four sections and chapters - &quot;Tur&#x27;s&quot; structure down to the &quot;siman&quot; is retained in the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;.
* The views in the other commentaries are often relevant in ascertaining or explaining the Ashkenazi version of Jewish law, as codified by Moses Isserles in his &quot;Mappah&quot;.

Students of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, particularly in Orthodox Semikhah programs, typically study the &quot;Tur&quot; and the &quot;Beit Yosef&quot; concurrently with the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; itself: in some editions the two works are printed together, to allow comparison of corresponding &quot;simanim&quot;.

<text>is a village in Ogasawara Subprefecture, Tokyo Metropolis, Japan, that governs the Bonin Islands, Volcano Islands, and three remote islands (Nishinoshima, Minamitorishima and Okinotorishima).

==History==
In 1940, five municipalities were created in the islands, which had been unincorporated before, two on Chichijima, two on Hahajima, and one on Iwojima.
* on Chichijima
* on Chichijima
* on Hahajima
* on Hahajima
* on Iwojima (Iōtō), which includes all of the Volcano Islands

Both villages of Kita Iwo Jima became part of the newly created Iwojima municipality in 1940:
*Ishinomura (east)
*Nishimura (west)

Following World War II, the islands were administered by the United States. The islands were returned to Japanese control in 1968 and organized as Ogasawara Village.

===Airport plan===
In August 2020, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government held a council about a potential airport. It would be operational in 10 years at the earliest. The mayor of Ogasawara Village, Kazuo Morishita said &quot;The airport is the village&#x27;s long-cherished wish.&quot; Governor Koike also said at a regular press conference that day, &quot;(The new model plan) is an effective measure to secure the air routes necessary to protect the lives of the islanders.&quot;

==Geography==
The municipality consists of the following groups and single isolated islands:
*, 73.00 km2
**, 6.57 km2
**, 38.89 km2
**, 27.54 km2
* 29.71 km2
** 5.57 km2
** 20.60 km2
** 3.54 km2
**, a single isolated island west of Hahajima rettō and part of the Volcano Islands, 0.29 km2
* 0.01 km2
* 1.40 km2

The southernmost (uninhabited) group is known as the &quot;Volcano Islands&quot;. 700 km further south is Okinotorishima, and 1,900 km further east is Minamitorishima.

The population of the municipality resides on Chichi-jima (pop. about 2300) and Haha-jima (pop. about 500). The administration and village hall is located in the village of Omura on Chichi-jima. In addition, there is an air base with 400 soldiers on Iwojima of the Volcano Islands.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Ogasawara has remained relatively steady in recent decades.

==Education==

Ogasawara Village operates the islands&#x27; public elementary and junior high schools.
* Ogasawara Village Municipal Ogasawara Elementary School (小笠原村立小笠原小学校) in Chichi-jima
* Ogasawara Village Municipal Ogasawara Junior High School (小笠原村立小笠原中学校) in Chichi-jima
* Ogasawara Village Municipal Haha-jima Elementary School and Junior High School (小笠原村立母島小中学校) on Haha-jima

<text>The East Germanic languages, also called the Oder-Vistula Germanic languages, are a group of extinct Germanic languages that were spoken by East Germanic peoples. East Germanic is one of the primary branches of Germanic languages, along with North Germanic and West Germanic.

The only East Germanic language of which texts are known is Gothic, although a word list and some short sentences survive from the debatedly-related Crimean Gothic. Other East Germanic languages include Vandalic and Burgundian, though the only remnants of these languages are in the form of isolated words and short phrases. Furthermore, the inclusion of Burgundian has been called into doubt. Crimean Gothic is believed to have survived until the 18th century in isolated areas of Crimea.

==History==

East Germanic was presumably native to the north of Central Europe, especially modern Poland, and likely even the first branch to split off from Proto-Germanic in the first millennium BC.

For many years, the least controversial theory of the origin of the Germanic (and East Germanic) languages was the so-called Gotho-Nordic hypothesis: that they originated in the Nordic Bronze Age of Southern Scandinavia and along the coast of the northernmost parts of Germany.

By the 1st century AD, the writings of Pomponius Mela, Pliny the Elder, and Tacitus indicate a division of Germanic-speaking peoples into large groupings with shared ancestry and culture. (This division has been taken over in modern terminology about the divisions of Germanic languages.)

Based on accounts by Jordanes, Procopius, Paul the Deacon and others, as well as linguistic, toponymic, and archaeological evidence, the East Germanic tribes, the speakers of the East Germanic languages related to the North Germanic tribes, had migrated from Scandinavia into the area lying east of the Elbe. In fact, the Scandinavian influence on Pomerania and today&#x27;s northern Poland from c. 1300–1100 BC (Nordic Bronze Age sub-period III) onwards was so considerable that this region is sometimes included in the Nordic Bronze Age culture.

There is also archaeological and toponymic evidence which has been taken as suggesting that Burgundians lived on the Danish island of Bornholm (), and that Rugians lived on the Norwegian coast of Rogaland ().

==Classification==

* East Germanic †
** Gothic †
** Vandalic †
** Burgundian †
** (German &quot;-isch&quot; corresponds to English &quot;-ish, -ic, -ian&quot;) †
** (Spoken by the Gepids) †
** †
** Crimean Gothic † (disputed, alternatively considered to be West Germanic)
Frederik Hartmann argues that East Germanic is not a valid genetic clade, as the three most attested languages conventionally identified as east Germanic (Burgundian, Vandalic, Gothic) do not share any common innovations with each other and all independently split from Proto-Germanic. Hartmann instead prefers the term Eastern rim languages to refer to these languages.

<text>Prachatice (; ) is a town in the South Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 11,000 inhabitants. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument reservation.

==Administrative division==
Prachatice consists of 12 municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Prachatice I (767)
*Prachatice II (9,136)
*Kahov (44)
*Libínské Sedlo (105)
*Městská Lhotka (9)
*Oseky (87)
*Ostrov (109)
*Perlovice (24)
*Podolí (26)
*Stádla (5)
*Staré Prachatice (114)
*Volovice (14)
==Etymology==
The name is derived from the old Slavic personal name Prachata, meaning &quot;the village of Prachata&#x27;s people&quot;.

==Geography==
Prachatice is located about west of České Budějovice. It lies in the Bohemian Forest Foothills. The highest point is the Libín mountain at above sea level. The stream of Živný potok flows through the town. The Blanice River flows along the northwestern municipal border.

==History==

===9th–15th centuries===
Prachatice was founded with the beginning of trade on the Golden Trail, an important salt trade route beginning in Passau, Bavaria. Probably in the 9th or 10th century, a settlement was founded in the area of today&#x27;s Staré Prachatice (&quot;Old Prachatice&quot;) town part. In the second half of the 12th century, it was acquired by Vyšehrad Chapter.

When the settlement ceased to suit its purpose, a new settlement was established near the old one at the end of the 13th century. In 1312, Prachatice was first referred to as a town. In 1323, King John of Bohemia confirmed to the town of Prachatice the right to use the trade route to Passau and to collect customs duties there. Prachatice was fully completed in the 3rd quarter of the 14th century.

During the Hussite Wars in the 15th century, Prachatice was attacked twice, It was eventually conquered by the Hussites, who killed most of the population. In 1436, after the end of the conflict, Prachatice was granted the status of royal town by King Sigismund, and all its old privileges were confirmed. Only one year later, the town was offered as collateral to Jan Smil of Krems, but it fell under the control of the Rosenberg family for a short period following Smil&#x27;s execution in 1439 at Český Krumlov. Oldřich II of Rosenberg sold the town almost immediately after the execution, but it again became property of the family in 1501. In the second half of the 15th century, the number of inhabitants increased, and new houses had to be built.

===16th–20th centuries===
In the 16th century, trade on the trail reached its peak and the town prospered. The Rosenbergs controlled Prachatice until 1601 when Peter Vok of Rosenberg, the last member of the family, sold the town to Emperor Rudolf II who would again make it a royal town in 1609. It remained firmly under royal control until the Bohemian Revolt during which it sided with the rebels. However, in 1620, the town was reconquered and connected to the Krumlov manor. After the Battle of White Mountain, Prachatice lost its royal town status and privileges and became the property of the Eggenberg family though the emperor&#x27;s troops remained in the town throughout the remainder of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Later in the war, the town was conquered by the Swedish army, and another large ransom was demanded. In the second half of the 17th century, trade on the Golden Trail declined and never revived.

The town and the whole Krumlov manor changed hands again in 1719, following the death of Princess Marie Arnoštka of Eggenberg and came under the control of the affluent Schwarzenberg family. The weak political and economic situation affected the condition of the houses. Old ones were not reconstructed, and new ones were not built.

Until 1918, the town was part of Austria-Hungary, in the district of the same name, one of the 94 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Bohemia.

After 1945, the German population was expelled as a result of World War II.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
There are no large industrial companies. The largest employer based in the town is the hospital. The largest industrial employers are the companies of InTiCa Systems (manufacturer of electronic components) and Reinfurt-ČR (manufacturer of ball bearings), both with more than 250 employees.

==Transport==
Prachatice is located on the railway line Číčenice–Nové Údolí.

==Culture==
The town hosts the Golden Salt Path Celebrations every year with a rich cultural program.

==Sights==

The historic centre is formed by Velké Square and adjoining streets, and is delimited by the remains of the town walls. Due to the stagnation of economic life in the 17th and 18th centuries, Prachatice have many Renaissance buildings, some of then reconstructed in the Empire style. Since 1981, the historic core of the town has been protected as an urban monument reservation.

One of the main landmarks of the town centre is the Old Town Hall, a Renaissance building from 1570–1571. The New Town Hall was built in pseudo-Renaissance style in 1903.

The Church of Saint James the Great near the square is the largest building in the historic centre. It is a late Gothic building first mentioned in 1359. Its final form was achieved by reconstructions between 1505 and 1513.

Dolní Gate (&quot;Lower Gate&quot;; also called &quot;Písecká&quot;) is a preserved element of stone town fortifications, which comes from the first half of the 15th century. The gate is from around 1527 and creates the entrance to the historic centre.

<text>printf is a C standard library function that formats text and writes it to standard output.

The name, &quot;printf&quot; is short for &quot;print formatted&quot; where &quot;print&quot; refers to output to a printer although the functions are not limited to printer output.

The standard library provides many other similar functions that form a family of &quot;printf-like&quot; functions. These functions accept a &quot;format string&quot; parameter and a variable number of value parameters that the function serializes per the format string and writes to an output stream or a string buffer.

The format string is encoded as a template language consisting of verbatim text and &quot;format specifiers&quot; that each specify how to serialize a value. As the format string is processed left-to-right, a subsequent value is used for each format specifier found. A format specifier starts with a  character and has one or more following characters that specify how to serialize a value.

The format string syntax and semantics is the same for all of the functions in the printf-like family.

Mismatch between the format specifiers and count and type of values can cause a crash or vulnerability.

The printf format string is complementary to the scanf format string, which provides formatted input (lexing a.k.a. parsing). Both format strings provide relatively simple functionality compared to other template engines, lexers and parsers.

The formatting design has been copied in other programming languages.

==History==

===1950s: Fortran===

Early programming languages like Fortran used special statements with different syntax from other calculations to build formatting descriptions. In this example, the format is specified on line , and the command refers to it by line number:

 PRINT 601, IA, IB, AREA
 601 FORMAT (4H A= ,I5,5H B= ,I5,8H AREA= ,F10.2, 13H SQUARE UNITS)
Hereby:

An output with input arguments , , and might look like this:

===1960s: BCPL and ALGOL 68===
In 1967, BCPL appeared. Its library included the routine. An example application looks like this:

WRITEF(&quot;%I2-QUEENS PROBLEM HAS %I5 SOLUTIONS*N&quot;, NUMQUEENS, COUNT)
Hereby:

* indicates an integer of width 2 (the order of the format specification&#x27;s field width and type is reversed compared to C&#x27;s );
* indicates an integer of width 5;
* is a BCPL &quot;language&quot; escape sequence representing a newline character (for which C uses the escape sequence ).

In 1968, ALGOL 68 had a more function-like API, but still used special syntax (the delimiters surround special formatting syntax):

printf(($&quot;Color &quot;g&quot;, number1 &quot;6d,&quot;, number2 &quot;4zd,&quot;, hex &quot;16r2d,&quot;, float &quot;-d.2d,&quot;, unsigned value&quot;-3d&quot;.&quot;l$,
 &quot;red&quot;, 123456, 89, BIN 255, 3.14, 250));
In contrast to Fortran, using normal function calls and data types simplifies the language and compiler, and allows the implementation of the input/output to be written in the same language.

These advantages were thought to outweigh the disadvantages (such as a complete lack of type safety in many instances) up until the 2000s, and in most newer languages of that era I/O is not part of the syntax.

People have since learned that this potentially results in consequences, ranging from security exploits to hardware failures (e.g., phone&#x27;s networking capabilities being permanently disabled after trying to connect to an access point named &quot;%p%s%s%s%s%n&quot;). Modern languages, such as C++20 and later, tend to include format specifications as a part of the language syntax, which restore type safety in formatting to an extent, and allow the compiler to detect some invalid combinations of format specifiers and data types at compile time.

===1970s: C===

In 1973, was included as a C standard library routine as part of Version 4 Unix.

===1990s: Shell command===

In 1990, a shell command was attested as part of 4.3BSD-Reno. It is modeled after the C standard library function.

In 1991, a command was included with GNU shellutils (now part of GNU Core Utilities).

===2000s: -Wformat safety===

The need to do something about the range of problems resulting from lack of type safety has prompted attempts to make the C++ compiler -aware.

The option of GCC allows compile-time checks to calls, enabling the compiler to detect a subset of invalid calls (and issue either a warning or an error, stopping the compilation altogether, depending on other flags).

Since the compiler is inspecting format specifiers, enabling this effectively extends the C++ syntax by making formatting a part of it.

===2020s: C++20 Format Specifiers and C++23 print ===

As said above, numerous issues with &#x27;s lack of type safety resulted in the revision of approach to formatting, and C++20 onwards include format specifications in the language to enable type-safe formatting.

The approach (and syntax) of C++20 resulted from effectively incorporating Victor Zverovich&#x27;s API into the language specification (Zverovich wrote the first draft of the new format proposal); consequently, is an implementation of the C++20 format specification.

The formatting function has been combined with output in C++23, which provides the command as a replacement for .
As the format specification has become a part of the language syntax, a C++ compiler is able to prevent invalid combinations of types and format specifiers in many cases. Unlike the option, this is not an optional feature.

The format specification of and is, in itself, an extensible &quot;mini-language&quot; (referred to as such in the specification), an example of a domain-specific language.

Incorporation of a separate, domain specific mini-language specifically for formatting into the C++ language syntax for , therefore, completes the historical cycle, bringing the state-of-the-art (as of 2024) back to what it was in the case of FORTRAN&#x27;s first implementation in the 1950s discussed in the beginning of this section.

== Format specifier ==

Formatting of a value is specified as markup in the format string. For example, the following outputs &lt;samp style=&quot;white-space:pre&quot;&gt;Your age is &lt;/samp&gt; and then the value of the variable in decimal format.
printf(&quot;Your age is %d&quot;, age);
===Syntax===

The syntax for a format specifier is:
===Parameter field===

The parameter field is optional. If included, then matching specifiers to values is sequential. The numeric value selects the n-th value parameter.

This is a POSIX extension; not C99.

This field allows for using the same value multiple times in a format string instead of having to pass the value multiple times. If a specifier includes this field, then subsequent specifiers must also.

For example, 

printf(&quot;%2$d %2$#x; %1$d %1$#x&quot;,16,17);

outputs: .

This field is particularly useful for localizing messages to different natural languages that use different word orders.

In Microsoft Windows, support for this feature is via a different function, .

===Flags field===

The flags field can be zero or more of (in any order):

===Width field===

The width field specifies the number of characters to output. If the value can be represented in fewer characters, then the value is left-padded with spaces so that output is the number of characters specified. If the value requires more characters, then the output is longer than the specified width. A value is never truncated.

For example, specifies a width of 3 and outputs with a space on the left to output 3 characters. The call outputs which is 4 characters long since that is the minimum width for that value even though the width specified is 3.

If the width field is omitted, the output is the minimum number of characters for the value.

If the field is specified as , then the width value is read from the list of values in the call. For example, outputs &lt;samp style=&quot;white-space:pre&quot;&gt; 10&lt;/samp&gt; where the second parameter, , is the width (matches with ) and is the value to serialize (matches with ).

Though not part of the width field, a leading zero is interpreted as the zero-padding flag mentioned above, and a negative value is treated as the positive value in conjunction with the left-alignment flag also mentioned above.

The width field can be used to format values as a table (tabulated output). But, columns do not align if any value is larger than fits in the width specified. For example, notice that the last line value () does not fit in the first column of width 3 and therefore the column is not aligned.
 1 1
 12 12
123 123
1234 123
===Precision field===

The precision field usually specifies a limit of the output, depending on the particular formatting type. For floating-point numeric types, it specifies the number of digits to the right of the decimal point to which the output should be rounded; for and it specifies the total number of significant digits (before and after the decimal, not including leading or trailing zeroes) to round to. For the string type, it limits the number of characters that should be output, after which the string is truncated.

The precision field may be omitted, or a numeric integer value, or a dynamic value when passed as another argument when indicated by an asterisk (). For example, outputs .

===Length field===

The length field can be omitted or be any of:

Platform-specific length options came to exist prior to widespread use of the ISO C99 extensions, including:

ISO C99 includes the codice_2 header file that includes a number of macros for platform-independent coding. For example: specifies decimal format for a 64-bit signed integer. Since the macros evaluate to a string literal, and the compiler concatenates adjacent string literals, the expression compiles to a single string.

Macros include:

===Type field===

The type field can be any of:

=== Custom data type formatting ===

A common way to handle formatting with a custom data type is to format the custom data type value into a string, then use the specifier to include the serialized value in a larger message.

Some printf-like functions allow extensions to the escape-character-based mini-language, thus allowing the programmer to use a specific formatting function for non-builtin types. One is the (now deprecated) glibc&#x27;s . However, it is rarely used due to the fact that it conflicts with static format string checking. Another is Vstr custom formatters, which allows adding multi-character format names.

Some applications (like the Apache HTTP Server) include their own printf-like function, and embed extensions into it. However these all tend to have the same problems that has.

The Linux kernel codice_3 function supports a number of ways to display kernel structures using the generic specification, by additional format characters. For example, prints an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal form. This allows static format string checking (of the portion) at the expense of full compatibility with normal printf.

==Family==

Variants of provide the formatting features but with additional or slightly different behavior.

 outputs to a system file object instead of standard output.

 writes to a string buffer instead of standard output.

 provides a level of safety over since the caller provides a length (n) parameter that specifies the maximum number or chars to write to the buffer.

For most printf-family functions, there is a variant that accepts  rather than a variable length parameter list. For example, there is a , , .

==Vulnerabilities==

=== Format string attack ===
Extra value parameters are ignored, but if the format string has more format specifiers than value parameters passed the behavior is undefined. For some C compilers, an extra format specifier results in consuming a value even though there isn&#x27;t one. This can allow the format string attack. Generally, for C, arguments are passed on the stack. If too few arguments are passed, then printf can read past the end of the stack frame, thus allowing an attacker to read the stack.

Some compilers, like the GNU Compiler Collection, will statically check the format strings of printf-like functions and warn about problems (when using the flags or ). GCC will also warn about user-defined printf-style functions if the non-standard &quot;format&quot; is applied to the function.

===Uncontrolled format string exploit===

The format string is often a string literal, which allows static analysis of the function call. However, the format string can be the value of a variable, which allows for dynamic formatting but also a security vulnerability known as an uncontrolled format string exploit.

===Memory write===

Although an output function on the surface, allows writing to a memory location specified by an argument via . This functionality is occasionally used as a part of more elaborate format-string attacks.

The functionality also makes accidentally Turing-complete even with a well-formed set of arguments. A game of tic-tac-toe written in the format string is a winner of the 27th IOCCC.

==Programming languages with printf==

Notable programming languages that include printf or printf-like functionality:

Excluded are languages that use format strings that deviate from the style in this article (such as AMPL and Elixir), languages that inherit their implementation from the JVM or other environment (such as Clojure and Scala), and languages that do not have a standard native printf implementation but have external libraries which emulate printf behavior (such as JavaScript).

<text>Oliver Napoleon Hill (October 26, 1883 – November 8, 1970) was an American self-help author. He is best known for his book &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot; (1937), which is among the best-selling self-help books of all time. Hill&#x27;s works insisted that fervid expectations are essential to improving one&#x27;s life. Most of his books are promoted as expounding principles to achieve &quot;success&quot;.

Hill is a controversial figure. Accused of fraud, modern historians also doubt many of his claims, such as that he met Andrew Carnegie and that he was an attorney.

==Life and career==
===Childhood===
Hill was born in a one-room cabin near the Appalachian town of Pound in southwest Virginia. His parents were James Monroe Hill and Sarah Sylvania (Blair), and he was the grandson of James Madison Hill and Elizabeth (Jones). His grandfather came to the United States from England and settled in southwestern Virginia in 1847. His father was a dentist, at first unofficially and then with a license.

Hill&#x27;s mother died when he was nine years old, and his father remarried two years later to Martha. According to Landers and Ritt his stepmother was a good influence for him: &quot;Hill&#x27;s stepmother, the widow of a school principal, civilized the wild-child, Napoleon, making him go to school and attend church.&quot; At the age of 13, Hill began writing as a &quot;mountain reporter&quot;, initially for his father&#x27;s newspaper. At the age of fifteen, he married a local girl who had accused him of fathering her child; the girl later recanted the claim, and the marriage was annulled.

===Early career===
At the age of seventeen, Hill graduated from high school and moved to Tazewell, Virginia, to attend business school. In 1901, Hill accepted a job working for the lawyer Rufus A. Ayers, a coal magnate and former Virginia attorney general. Author Richard Lingeman wrote that Hill received this job after arranging to keep confidential the death of a black bellhop whom the previous manager of the mine had accidentally shot while drunk.

Hill left his coal mine management job soon afterward and enrolled in law school before withdrawing owing to a lack of funds. Later in life, Hill would use the title of &quot;Attorney of Law&quot;, although Hill&#x27;s official biography notes that &quot;there is no record of his having actually performed legal services for anyone.&quot;

In 1903, Hill married for the second time to Edith Whitman; in 1905 their child Edith Whitman Hill was born. Their marriage was a fraught one due to Hill&#x27;s alleged abuse of his wife and daughter in addition to his infidelity.

=== Failed business ventures and charges of fraud ===
Hill relocated to Mobile, Alabama, in 1907 and co-founded the Acree-Hill Lumber Company. In October 1908, the &quot;Pensacola Journal&quot; reported that the company was facing bankruptcy proceedings and charges of mail fraud for purchasing lumber from outside Mobile, from other counties in Alabama and Florida, and selling it below cost, thereby failing to generate a return. 

His wife Edith filed for divorce in 1908; at the proceedings Hill&#x27;s friends and business partners testified to his affairs with prostitutes. It is sometime in 1908 that Hill claims his pivotal conversation with Andrew Carnegie happened; however, the existence of such a meeting is a point of contention amongst Hill biographers.

Following the exposure of his fraud in Alabama, Hill fled to Washington, DC, where he dropped Oliver as his first name and began going by Napoleon Hill. In 1909 he founded the Automobile College of Washington. The college assembled cars for the Carter Motor Corporation, which declared bankruptcy in early 1912; students were not paid for their labor. During April 1912, the automobile magazine &quot;Motor World&quot; accused Hill&#x27;s college of being a scam and derided its marketing materials as &quot;a joke to anyone of average intelligence&quot;. Following the bankruptcy of the Carter Motor Corporation, Hill pivoted the organization to teaching people how to sell cars rather than make them. Students were incentivized to themselves sell Automobile College of Washington courses on which they would earn a commission. In practice, the focus was on signing up more students, not in learning how to sell cars. In this form, it resembled a modern  multi-level marketing company.

During June 1910, Hill married Florence Elizabeth Horner, with whom he had three sons: James, born in 1911; Napoleon Blair, born in 1912; and David, born in 1918. Hill would postpone their honeymoon until 1919. Horner was in high school when they met and was from a wealthy West Virginia family. Despite investment from her family, the Automobile College of Washington closed in 1912. He subsequently moved to Chicago and accepted a job with the La Salle Extension University, before co-founding the Betsy Ross Candy Shop. Hill was soon forced out of the candy shop by his partners and had left La Salle within a year of starting. 

In September 1915, he established the George Washington Institute of Advertising, where he intended to teach principles of success and self-confidence. On June 4, 1918, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported that the state of Illinois had issued two warrants for his arrest, charging him with violating blue sky laws by fraudulently attempting to sell shares of his school at a $100,000 capitalization, despite the school&#x27;s possessing assets appraised only at $1,200. 

In 1917, Hill threatened the Illinois Central Railroad with a lawsuit due to low lighting in their cars allegedly making him need glasses. The George Washington Institute was unaccredited and closed in 1918 following allegations of fraud made by students. During this time, Florence and their children were living with her family in West Virginia.

Following the closure of the George Washington Institute, Hill embarked on other business ventures, among them the personal magazines &quot;Hill&#x27;s Golden Rule&quot; and &quot;Napoleon Hill&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. In 1919 the Federal Trade Commission brought charges against Hill and Hill&#x27;s Golden Rule for fraudulent advertising and laundering funds meant for a veteran&#x27;s charity into a fraudulent oil stock scheme. Hill claimed that it was in 1918 following the collapse of GWI that Woodrow Wilson personally reached out to Hill for his help winning the First World War; Hill claimed that Wilson offered him large sums for his aid but that he did not accept any payment for his work because he was a patriot. He claimed that he was so important and involved in the war effort that he had the power to veto the President. Hill claimed to have participated intimately in the negotiation of the armistice with Germany. These claims are not believed to be true. White House records include no reference to his ever being there.

In 1922, he opened the Intra-Wall Correspondence School, a charitable foundation intended to provide educational materials to prisoners in Ohio. The foundation was directed by, among others, check forger and former convict Butler Storke, who would be sent back to prison only a year later. According to Hill&#x27;s official biography, it was during this period that hundreds of documents proving Hill&#x27;s association with various famous figures were destroyed in a Chicago storage fire. Intra-Wall Correspondence School primarily sold &quot;Hill&#x27;s Golden Rule&quot; and correspondence courses. In 1923 it was exposed by local newspapers as a scam. Following the murder of Donald Mellett, he promoted a lecture tour based on their acquaintance, with Hill claiming to have been the target of the same assassins.

Hill lost control over &quot;Hill&#x27;s Golden Rule&quot; to a group of disgruntled employees. Hill attempted to get revenge against one of the employees by reporting them to the FBI as a spy.

Hill founded the Peptomists and the Co-Operative Club which advertised themselves as business organizations in the style of the rotary club.

=== &quot;The Law of Success&quot; ===
During 1928, Hill relocated to Philadelphia and persuaded a Connecticut-based publisher to publish his eight-volume work &quot;The Law of Success&quot; (1925). The book was Hill&#x27;s first major success, allowing Hill to adopt an opulent lifestyle. By 1929, he had already bought a Rolls-Royce and a property in the Catskill Mountains, with the aid of some lenders.

The beginning of the Great Depression, however, affected Hill&#x27;s finances adversely, forcing his Catskills property into foreclosure before the end of 1929. He went broke, forcing his wife&#x27;s family to pay for the expenses of Florence and her children.

Hill&#x27;s next published work, &quot;The Magic Ladder to Success&quot; (1930), proved to be a commercial failure. During the next few years, Hill traveled through the country, returning to his habits from the prior decade of initiating various short-lived business ventures. He was involved in the production of the first Mormon film &quot;&quot;, which collapsed after investors accused Hill of malfeasance. Hill claimed to have been an advisor to Franklin D. Roosevelt during this time. He claimed to have coined the President&#x27;s famous phrase &quot;The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.&quot;

=== &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot; ===
In 1937, Hill published the bestselling book &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot;, which became Hill&#x27;s best-known work. Hill&#x27;s new wife Rosa Lee Beeland contributed substantially to the authoring and editing of &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot;. Hill&#x27;s biographers would later say this book sold 20 million copies over 50 years, although as Richard Lingeman remarks in his brief biography, &quot;Alice Payne Hackett&#x27;s &quot;70 Years of Best Sellers&quot; suggests the number was considerably less.&quot;

Wealthy once more, Hill resumed his lavish lifestyle and purchased a new estate in Mount Dora, Florida. Napoleon and Rosa become involved with The Royal Fraternity of the Master Metaphysicians, a cult led by James Bernard Schafer, which regarded &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot; as a religious text. Napoleon became the godfather of &quot;Baby Jene&quot;, a child the cult had adopted and claimed to be raising in such a way that she would be immortal. In 1941 the child was returned to her biological mother. After being arrested and convicted in 1942, Schafer claimed that Napoleon had been to blame. 

The couple divorced around 1940. With much of the wealth from the book going to Rosa, Napoleon returned to his pursuit of success. Rosa proceeded to marry her divorce lawyer. Hill and Rosa never repaid Blair for the $300 loan; indeed, Rosa taunted Blair about it. Rosa would later write a self help book entitled &quot;How to Attract Men and Money.&quot;

===Starting again===
In 1941 Hill published &quot;Mental Dynamite&quot;, but it was a commercial failure. 

Hill met Annie Lou Norman, who was 47 years old, where he rented a room from her. They married in 1943 and relocated to California. Hill went on the lecture circuit once again. In 1947 he briefly hosted a show on KFWB Radio in Los Angeles. In 1952 he launched a new scam selling courses about success in Missouri. The scam soon collapsed, and he set up a firm called Napoleon Hill Associates to sell courses with W. Clement Stone. In the 1960s Hill and Stone fell out. Hill turned to selling his course &quot;Science of Success&quot; through franchises. In 1963 he founded the Napoleon Hill Foundation.

==Philosophy of Achievement==

Hill&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy of Achievement&quot;, offered as a formula for rags-to-riches success, was published initially in the 1928 multi-volume study course entitled &quot;The Law of Success&quot;, a rewrite of a 1925 manuscript. Hill identified freedom, democracy, capitalism, and harmony as being among the foundations to his &quot;Philosophy of Achievement&quot;. He asserted that without these foundations, great personal achievements would not be possible.

Hill claimed his philosophy was superior to those of others and that its principles were responsible for the successes of Americans. Hill blamed failure on such emotions as fear and selfishness.

A &quot;secret&quot; of achievement was discussed in &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot;, but Hill did not explicitly identify this secret in the book, insisting that readers would benefit most if they discovered it for themselves.

In the introduction, Hill states of the &quot;secret&quot; that Andrew Carnegie &quot;carelessly tossed it into my mind&quot; and that it inspired Manuel L. Quezon of the Philippine Islands to &quot;gain freedom for his people&quot;. Although he mentions a &quot;burning desire for money&quot; repeatedly throughout the book, he suggests that avarice is not his &quot;secret&quot; at all. 

Hill returned to the topic of a secret in a 1967 book, where he explicitly stated:

He presents the notion of a &quot;Definite Major Purpose&quot; as a challenge to his readers to ask themselves: &quot;In what do I truly believe?&quot; According to Hill, &quot;98%&quot; of people have few or no strong beliefs, which made their achieving success unlikely.

Hill declares that the life story of his son Blair is an inspiration to him, claiming that despite being born without ears, Blair had grown up able to hear and speak almost normally. Hill reports that his son, during his last year of college, read chapter two of the manuscript of &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot;, discovered Hill&#x27;s secret &quot;for himself&quot;, and then inspired &quot;hundreds and thousands&quot; of people who could neither listen nor speak.

From 1952 to 1962, Hill taught his &quot;Philosophy of Personal Achievement—Lectures on Science of Success&quot; in association with W. Clement Stone. During 1960, Hill and Stone co-authored the book &quot;Success Through A Positive Mental Attitude&quot;. Norman Vincent Peale is quoted saying that Hill and Stone &quot;have the rare gift of inspiring and helping people&quot; and that he owes &quot;them both a personal debt of gratitude for the helpful guidance I have received from their writings.&quot;

The book is listed in John C. Maxwell&#x27;s &quot;A Lifetime &quot;Must Read&quot; Books List&quot;.

Hill claimed insight into racism, slavery, oppression, failure, revolution, war, and poverty, asserting that overcoming these difficulties using his &quot;Philosophy of Achievement&quot; was the responsibility of every human.

=== Influence of famous people ===
Later in life, Hill claimed that the turning point of his life had been a 1908 assignment to interview the industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. At that time, Carnegie was among the most powerful men in the world. Hill wrote that Carnegie had actually met with him at that time and challenged him to interview wealthy people to discover a simple formula for success, and that he had then interviewed many successful people of the time. The authenticity of many of Hill&#x27;s claims has been widely disputed. Napoleon Hill&#x27;s collaboration with Andrew Carnegie has remained contentious. &quot;

The acknowledgments in his 1928 multi-volume work &quot;The Law of Success&quot;, listed forty-five of those he had studied, &quot;the majority of these men at close range, in person&quot;, like those to whom the book set was dedicated: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford, and Edwin C. Barnes (an associate of Thomas Edison). Hill reported that Carnegie had given him a letter of introduction to Ford, who Hill said then introduced him to Alexander Graham Bell, Elmer R. Gates, Thomas Edison, and Luther Burbank.

Endorsements for &quot;The Law of Success&quot; were allegedly sent in by William H. Taft, Cyrus H. K. Curtis, Thomas Edison, Luther Burbank, E. M. Statler, Edward W. Bok, and John D. Rockefeller. The list in the acknowledgments includes, among those Hill wrote that he had personally interviewed, Rufus A. Ayers, John Burroughs, Harvey Samuel Firestone, Elbert H. Gary, James J. Hill, George Safford Parker, Theodore Roosevelt, Charles M. Schwab, Frank A. Vanderlip, John Wanamaker, F. W. Woolworth, Daniel Thew Wright, and William Wrigley Jr. 

Aside from these, Hill&#x27;s other claims have been called into question. There is little evidence that he aided President Wilson to negotiate Germany&#x27;s surrender in World War I; that he helped President Roosevelt write his fireside chats; or that he was an attorney. There are no known records of Hill&#x27;s meetings with the famous men he claimed to have interviewed besides for a brief photo op with Edison.

==Alleged spirit visitations==
Hill openly described visits from spirits in chapter 12 of his book &quot;Grow Rich! With Peace of Mind&quot; (1967). He described them as unseen friends, unseen watchers, strange beings, and the Great School of Masters that had been guarding him, and who maintain a &quot;school of wisdom&quot;. Hill states that the &quot;Master&quot; spoke to him audibly, revealing secret knowledge. Hill further insists that the Masters &quot;can disembody themselves and travel instantly to any place they choose to acquire essential knowledge or to give knowledge directly, by voice, to anyone else.&quot;

&quot;Grow Rich! With Peace of Mind&quot; was allegedly influenced by Hill&#x27;s spirit voices; Hill cites the &quot;Master&quot;, writing: &quot;Much of what he said already has been presented to you in the chapters of this book or will follow in other chapters.&quot; In Chapter 14 of his book &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot; (1937), he openly talks about his &quot;invisible counselors&quot; with whom he discusses various areas of his life. Hill refers to these meetings with his counselors as being real because he consistently told himself they were real, a principle he refers to as &quot;autosuggestion&quot;. Hill does admit the talks were only real to him because of his imagination but professes his belief that the &quot;dominating thoughts and desires&quot; of one&#x27;s mind make those thoughts real.

== Death ==
Napoleon Hill died aged 87 on November 8, 1970. His estimated net worth at the time of his death was about $1 million .

==Legacy==
Hill&#x27;s works were inspired by the philosophy of New Thought and the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson, and are listed as New Thought reading.

Hill has been seen as inspiring later self-help works, such as Rhonda Byrne&#x27;s &quot;The Secret&quot;. &quot;Gizmodo&quot; has called him &quot;the most famous conman you&#x27;ve probably never heard of&quot;.

===Napoleon Hill Foundation===
The Napoleon Hill Foundation is a nonprofit foundation that promotes the teachings of Napoleon Hill. Following the death of Napoleon in 1970, the foundation and his widow Annie Lou were embroiled in a protracted court battle over the estate, which lasted into the 1980s. The foundation maintains a private archive of Hill&#x27;s papers. It awards the annual Napoleon Hill Award. The foundation continues to sell Hill&#x27;s books, courses, and leadership certificates. 

In 1995 the authorized biography of Hill&#x27;s life, &quot;A Lifetime of Riches&quot;, was released by Michael J. Ritt Jr. (the executive director of the foundation) and Kirk Landers, which came to a number of controversial conclusions.

<doc id="473419" wikidata="Q1026700" url="?curid=473419" title="Saint Croix Island, Maine">
<text>Saint Croix Island (), long known to locals as Dochet Island (), is a small uninhabited island in Maine near the mouth of the Saint Croix River that forms part of the Canada–United States border separating Maine from New Brunswick. The island is in the heart of the traditional lands of the Passamaquoddy people who, according to oral tradition, used it to store food away from the dangers of mainland animals. The island was the site of an early attempt at French colonization by Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons in 1604. In 1984 it was designated by the United States Congress as Saint Croix Island International Historic Site. There is no public access to the island, but there is a visitor contact station on the U.S. mainland and a display on the Canadian mainland opposite the island.

The island measures approximately and is located approximately upstream from the mouth of the river on Passamaquoddy Bay.

==History==
===Names===
The Passamaquoddy Nation, who had lived around and used the island for numerous centuries before European discovery used several names for the island including Muttoneguis, Muttoneguamus, Metanegwis, and Metnegwis.

St. Croix became known as Bone Island in the 18th century after many of the graves were exposed by erosion. Twenty-three sets of remains were removed in 1969 and subsequently reburied in 2003. Analysis showed that many of them had indications of scurvy, confirming the cause of the deaths described by Champlain. One skull showed signs of having been autopsied, which Champlain wrote that he had ordered to try to discover the cause of their illness.

The island was neutral territory in the War of 1812, leading it to be sometimes called Neutral Island.

Named by the French, Ile Ste-Croix, the island has also been called Demont&#x27;s Island, Doucett Island, and Docea&#x27;s Island, which became Dochet Island.

===Settlement by Europeans===

The French noble Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons, established a settlement on Saint Croix Island in June 1604 under the authority of Henry IV, King of France. This outpost was one of the first attempts by France at year-round colonization in the territory they called l&#x27;Acadie. Earlier attempts at Charlesbourg-Royal in 1541 by Jacques Cartier, at Sable Island in 1598 by Marquis de La Roche-Mesgouez, and at Tadoussac, Quebec, in 1600 by François Gravé Du Pont, had failed.

Cartographer Samuel de Champlain was part of the Dugua expedition and settlement on the small river island in 1604. During the first winter there, 35 of the 79 settlers perished due to a &quot;land-sickness&quot; believed to be scurvy. The following spring, Champlain and François Gravé Du Pont moved the settlement to a new location on the southern shore of the Bay of Fundy. Champlain had found the site during a shoreline reconnaissance for a more suitable site. Called Port-Royal, it became the first European settlement in New France. In 1607, Champlain left for France, never to return to Acadia again. However, in 1608, Champlain set sail in his third voyage from France to establish a settlement on a site on the Saint Lawrence River that later became Québec; it became the first permanent European settlement in New France.

In October 1613, after having burned the French mission at Mount Desert Island, Samuel Argall went on to burn the old French buildings that remained on Sainte-Croix before he moved on to raid Port Royal.

===Boundary dispute===

During a boundary dispute between Britain and the U.S. in 1797, the island was deemed to be under U.S. sovereignty by a survey of the river which determined it to be on the western side of its main channel.

Canada issued a nationally circulating twenty-five cent piece in 2004 that commemorated the island and the beginnings of Acadia there.

==International historic site==
The United States Congress designated the island Saint Croix Island National Monument in 1949. The monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. It was given its current International Historic Site designation by Congress on September 25, 1984, unique in the national park systems of both the United States and Canada. Since 1968, the island has been managed by the National Park Service from offices at Acadia National Park, the nearest staffed U.S. national park unit, in consultation with Parks Canada, which maintains a viewing and interpretation site on the New Brunswick side of the river.

Visitors are prohibited from the island to protect historical remains. A statue of Champlain and interpretive facilities on shore depict its history. In Canada, the island was first recognized in 1958 by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board (HSMB) as having national historic significance. It recommended creation of Dochet Island National Historic Site, but this was rejected by the government on the basis that its location fell outside national jurisdiction. A decade later, in 1968, the HSMB reiterated the site&#x27;s significance, suggesting Parks Canada &quot;cooperate with the United States National Parks Service in the development of the island as an Historic Park.&quot; This was approved, and today Parks Canada operates St. Croix Island International Historic Site at Bayside, Charlotte County, a site overlooking the island, similar to the U.S. approach to the site&#x27;s interpretation.

The two nations routinely cooperate on commemorative activities and promotions. Special commemorations by the two nations in 2004 marked the 400th anniversary of French settlement in North America. In 2009, the site started offering a full French translation of its U.S. website, offered by teen volunteer Olivier Fontenelle. Its Parks Canada website, like all others in its network, has been offered in French since first appearing online.

The HSMB designates three categories of commemoration: nationally significant Sites, Events, and Persons. While the HSMB had recommended Dochet Island National Historic Site in 1958, it was unclear whether the HSMB&#x27;s later recommendation, in 1968, was to name it a Site or an Event. This was clarified in 2008. Relying on a 1960 HSMB decision that naming national historic sites outside Canada should be avoided, and in light of policy that Events and Persons outside the country may be designated, it decided that Dochet Island had been designated a national historic event in 1968.

However, since the 1968 designation was approved under the name &quot;St. Croix Island&quot;, and this was the name used in the international agreement, the HSMB&#x27;s Status of Designations Committee confirmed the official name of the designation which had referred to Dochet Island would be &quot;Ste. Croix Island&quot;.

<doc id="473426" wikidata="Q2339999" url="?curid=473426" title="Siguiriyas">
<text>Siguiriyas (; also &quot;seguiriyas&quot;,
&quot;siguerillas&quot;, &quot;siguirillas&quot;, &quot;seguidilla gitana&quot;, etc.) are a form of flamenco music in the cante jondo category. This deep, expressive style is among the most important in flamenco. Unlike other palos of flamenco, siguiriyas stands out for being purely Romani (Calé) in origin. Siguiriyas are normally played in the key of A Phrygian with each measure (the compás) consisting of 12 counts with emphasis on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 8th and 11th beats as shown here:
: [1] 2 [3] 4 [5] 6 7 [8] 9 10 [11] 12

This rhythm can be contrasted with the rhythmic pattern of the soleares, which also has 12 beats, but the accents fall differently. Taking the unusual accenting into account, it can technically be seen as a measure of 3/4 (counted in eighth notes) starting on &quot;2&quot;, then a measure of 6/8 followed by the &quot;1 and&quot; of the 3/4. Every note is evenly spaced apart. For example:
: [2] and [3] and [1] 2 3 [4] 5 6 [1] and

However, this presents difficulties in counting and is counted more simply in 5 beats, with three &quot;short&quot; and two &quot;long&quot; beats:
: [1] and [2] and [3] and uh [4] and uh [5] and

In this case, the 1, 2, and 5 are the short beats and the 3 and 4 are long beats.

Siguiriyas are also often counted as a soleá started on 8, so the accents fall on:

[8] 9 [10] 11 [12] 1 2 [3] 4 5 [6] 7

Siguiriyas are often played with rubato which allow the singer to sing more expressively during a performance. During a performance, singers and dancers will increase and decrease the tempo for dramatic effect.

The compás often includes counter rhythms played by the guitar, palmas or the footwork of the dancers, creating interlocking rhythmic patterns.

== Cante and structure ==
The lyrics of siguiriyas deal with tragic themes such as imprisonment (e.g., Calabosito Oscuro sung by Juanito Valderrama) the death of a loved one and death in general (e.g., Si Acaso Muero sung by Camarón De La Isla), love, and religious ideas.
The oldest forms of siguiriyas were performed without musical accompaniment, akin to tonás. The more modern forms are accompanied by the guitar, where the nuances of the cante make it one of the most difficult styles to accompany and interpret.

Traditionally, the verses of siguiriyas are constructed of two short 6 syllable lines, followed by a longer 11 syllable line, then ending with another 6 syllable line, the rhythm being provided by the syllables of the words.

An example of this is a verse which has been attributed to Tomas El Nitri:

Por aquella Ventana

Que al campo salía

Le daba voces a la mare de mi alma

Y no me respondía

Through that window

Looking out onto the fields

I called out for the mother of my soul

And she did not answer me

This structure is not always strictly adhered to and in practice siguiriyas can be sung in many different syllable counts. This is due to the emotional intensity of siguiriyas where feeling can prevail over form. For this reason, it is not uncommon to find siguiriyas with other metrics, such as 7-7-11-7 and 8-5-11-6. A less widespread form is the 6-11-6 structure, in which the first verse rhymes with the third, and the second is usually repeated when singing.

There are different kinds of Siguiriyas associated with the style of a particular singer, each presenting its stylistic variants more or less marked by the personality of the interpreter. For example, in Cádiz the cante por siguiriya from El Planeta is simple and lacks ornamentation; in Triana, that of Frasco el Colorao is very ornate.

In a majority of Siguiriyas “Ay” is typically sung to introduce and emphasize the letras and is sung as a melisma across many syllables.

== Dance ==
The dance for siguiriyas was first introduced by Vicente Escudero in 1940. The dance is solemn and ceremonious, involving an introduction performed by guitar and singer, followed by an entrada, letra (dictated by the singer), escobilla, 2nd letra, a danced falseta and final escobilla performed by the dancer.

<text>Trinity College of Vermont was a Catholic college located in Burlington, Vermont. It was founded in September 1925 and closed in 2000.

Trinity was founded by the Sisters of Mercy of Vermont as New England&#x27;s second Catholic women&#x27;s college. The college was opened to provide an education to women, who at the time were an underserved population in the state of Vermont. The earliest students were taught in the areas of English, French, religion, mathematics, business skills, and the classics. Trinity College of Vermont was a pioneer in education and community service and promoted a mission of social justice.

It closed in 2000 due to financial constraints, after which the University of Vermont purchased its campus. By the time of its closing, 5,000 students had been educated at Trinity.

After the college&#x27;s closing, Trinity&#x27;s graduate-level programs moved to the Vermont Center at Southern New Hampshire University in Colchester, where they continued to be directed by former Trinity administrators. Business classes were moved to the newly formed Mercy Connections in Burlington, where the Women&#x27;s Small Business Program continues to offer entrepreneurial classes and support to women today.

<doc id="473432" wikidata="Q36211" url="?curid=473432" title="Crimean Gothic">
<text>Crimean Gothic was a Germanic, probably East Germanic, language spoken by the Crimean Goths in some isolated locations in Crimea until the late 18th century. Crimea was inhabited by the Goths in Late Antiquity and the Gothic language is known to have been in written use there until at least the mid 9th century CE. However, the exact relation of Crimean Gothic and &quot;Biblical Gothic&quot; is disputed.

Only about a hundred words of the Crimean Gothic language have been preserved, in a letter written by Flemish diplomat Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq in 1562 and later published in 1589. Various issues such as the fact that Busbecq&#x27;s source was not a native speaker of Crimean Gothic, that Busbecq recognized the language as Germanic and may have altered some words, and errors made by the printers mean that Busbecq&#x27;s letter is a flawed source of information. The letter shows various phonological features and words that are clearly of East Germanic origin while also lacking some features typical of Biblical Gothic.

==History==
Gothic peoples are attested living on Crimea beginning in the 3rd century CE. In 2015, five pieces of Gothic graffiti were identified from the basilica church at Mangup in Crimea; these were written in the Biblical Gothic language and Gothic alphabet and all come from after the mid 9th century, showing that at that time the Biblical Gothic language was still in use, alongside Greek, by the Goths in Crimea. The graffiti possibly show some phonetic developments of Gothic on Crimea ( → and → ), but not necessarily. A 9th-century life of Saint Cyril also mention Goths living on Crimea who used their own language and alphabet in religious services and to read the Bible.

The existence of a Germanic language spoken on Crimea is next mentioned by Fleming William of Rubruck when he visited the area in the 13th century. The Greek historian George Pachymeres, also 13th century, wrote that the Crimean Goths were adopting the Tatar language. However, in the 16th century, Crimean Gothic appears to have still been a vibrant language, with vocabulary in various different fields. Additionally, the primary source of information for Crimean Gothic, the Flemish diplomat Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq (1562), seems to have wanted to learn about the language because he thought it would be useful. However, two sixteenth-century sources mention the Crimean Goths using Greek and Tatar when communicating with outsiders. This trilingualism may indicate that the language was in decline. A report by Prussian polymath Peter Simon Pallas from 1794 states that he was unable to find any remnants of the language in Crimea, probably meaning that the language had become extinct by then.

==Corpus==
The sole longer attestation of Crimean Gothic is the &quot;Fourth Turkish Letter&quot; written by Flemish diplomatic Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, dated 1562 and first published in 1589. This lists about 80 words and the lyrics of a song. This gives about 101 words. The nature of Busbecq&#x27;s letter means that the data is problematic: firstly, Busbecq received his information mostly from a native speaker of Greek, meaning that the informant&#x27;s knowledge of the language and its phonology was likely imperfect; secondly, Busbecq recognized some words as related to Flemish and German and may have written them in ways that reflected that; thirdly, the typesetters appear to have made errors with the Crimean Gothic words when the letter was printed. The only other evidence for Crimean Gothic takes the form of a few personal and place names and a single proposed loanword into Tatar. The nature of this evidence makes definitive statements about Crimean Gothic difficult, with some features simply unknown.

Busbecq recognized the kinship of Crimean Gothic to West Germanic languages, and several words are given in forms that could easily be Dutch or German. He did not recognize many words as Germanic even though they were, such as &quot;iel&quot; (&#x27;health&#x27;, BGoth. ) and &quot;Sch[n]os&quot; (&#x27;fiancée&#x27;). A number of words only correspond to forms found in Biblical Gothic, some of which were unknown at the time that Busbecq was writing, such as &quot;menus&quot; &#x27;meat&#x27; (Biblical Gothic ), &quot;ael&quot; &#x27;stone&#x27; (Biblical Gothic ) and &quot;mycha&quot; &#x27;sword&#x27; (Biblical Gothic ). However, there are differences between the Crimean Gothic and Biblical Gothic vocabulary, for instance &quot;rintsch&quot; &#x27;mountain&#x27; instead of Biblical Gothic and &quot;broe&quot; &#x27;bread&#x27; instead of Biblical Gothic . The numerals have been heavily influenced by other languages, with two Iranic loanwords, &quot;sada&quot; (&#x27;hundred&#x27;) and &quot;hazer&quot; (&#x27;thousand&#x27;), and the forms for 11–19 likely showing Turkic influence. At least five other words are of non-Germanic origin, and some are of unclear etymology.

==Classification==
Most scholars classify Crimean Gothic as an East Germanic language. This is due to the presence of phonological features characteristic of or unique to East Germanic (such as Proto-Germanic (PGmc) /jj/→/ddj/), as well as the high proportion of words only attested in Biblical Gothic. However, the apparent lack of some characteristic phonetic mergers found in Biblical Gothic means that Crimean Gothic may not be a direct descendant of that language.

An alternative proposal, last argued by Ottar Grønvik, is that Crimean Gothic is a West Germanic language with a high proportion of East Germanic loanwords. Grønvik relied heavily on the distribution of short vowels in Crimean Gothic to make this conclusion; however, other scholars have argued that these features could have been influenced by Busbecq&#x27;s own knowledge of his native Flemish and German. Additionally, the sheer number of East Germanic loanwords appears unlikely.

*PGmc /*ē/ does not become /ā/: CGoth &quot;mīne&quot; (&#x27;moon&#x27;), BGoth , Old High German ; CGoth &quot;schlipen&quot; (to sleep), BGoth vs. Old English ;
*The PGmc. cluster /*lþ/ is maintained rather than becoming /ld/ (West Germanic) or /ll/ (North Germanic): CGoth &quot;Goltz&quot; (&#x27;gold&#x27;), BGoth .

===Features in common with West Germanic===
*Lack of Biblical Gothic collapse of PGmc /*e/ and /*i/ to /i/: CGoth &quot;Schuuester&quot;, BGoth ; CGoth &quot;Reghen&quot;, BGoth ;
*Umlaut of PGmc /*u/ to /o/ in CGoth &quot;goltz&quot; (&#x27;gold&#x27;) BGoth , Old English . Biblical Gothic shows no trace of any umlaut whatsoever.
*PGmc /*u/ may not have become /o/ before /r, h, hw/ as in Biblical Gothic: CGoth &quot;Thurn&quot; (&#x27;door&#x27;), BGoth , Old English ; but also CGoth &quot;kor[n]&quot; (&#x27;grain&#x27;), BGoth &quot;kaurn&quot;, Old Norse , Old English .
These features may be influenced by Busbecq&#x27;s own Flemish dialect, as the examples are all similar to Flemish words.

==Phonology==
===Consonant orthography===
The interference of Busbecq&#x27;s Greek informant and the orthography of Busbecq&#x27;s letter makes precise statements about the consonant phonemes of Crimean Gothic difficult.
*&lt;g&gt; and &lt;gh&gt; may have sounded as in Dutch ([ɣ]).
*&lt;h&gt;: The words recorded by Busbecq only begin with an &quot;h&quot; when he recognizes a word as Germanic: CGoth &quot;Handa&quot; (&#x27;hand&#x27;) vs. &quot;Ieltsch&quot; (&#x27;living, healthy&#x27;) = . This may indicate that there was no phoneme /h/ in Crimean Gothic.
*&lt;sch&gt; may indicate [s] at the end of a word (as in Flemish at the time), but may indicate [sx] or [ʃ] in other locations.
*&lt;tz&gt; appears to represent [θ], a form of writing the sound also used by Erasmus of Rotterdam.
*&lt; u &gt; or &lt;uu&gt; may represent [w] or [v].

===Vowel orthography===
*&lt;ie&gt; probably stands for [je] at the beginning of a word (&quot;Iel&quot;, &quot;Ies&quot;), but it is unclear if it is a diphthong inside a word or stands for [i:].
*the values of &lt;oe&gt; and &lt; u &gt; are disputed. They may have had the same values as in Busbecq&#x27;s Flemish, namely [u:] and [y:] respectively, or they may stand for [o:] and [u:].

===Other features===
*Degemination: long consonants appear to be simplified to a single consonant: CGoth &quot;ada&quot; vs. BGoth , CGoth &quot;Sune&quot; vs. BGoth ; however CGoth &quot;Brunna&quot; matches BGoth ;
*The etymologically inconsistent spelling of vowels in unaccented syllables probably indicates vowel reduction, likely to schwa: CGoth &quot;Boga&quot;, Old Norse , Old High German ; CGoth &quot;Ano&quot;, BGoth ;
*the PGmc (and Biblical Gothic) long vowels &quot;ē&quot; and &quot;ō&quot; have been raised to &quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot; respectively: CGoth &quot;Mine&quot; (&#x27;moon&#x27;), BGoth , CGoth &quot;Stul&quot; (&#x27;chair&#x27;), BGoth . Misspellings in Biblical Gothic give some evidence for this being a tendency in that language as well;
*Busbecq sometimes (but not usually) records words that begin with Germanic /d, b/ as /t, p/: CGoth &quot;plut&quot; &#x27;blood&#x27; (BGoth ), CGoth &quot;Tag&quot; (BGoth ). He also writes devoiced forms of /d/ before -s(ch) and word-finally: CGoth &quot;rintsch&quot; (BGoth ), CGoth &quot;Vvingart&quot; &#x27;vinyard&#x27; (BGoth ) and records final /g/ in /ng/ as /k/: CGoth &quot;Rinck&quot; &#x27;ring&#x27; (BGoth ).
*Busbecq writes PGmc /*k/ as /ch/ after a vowel: CGoth &quot;Ich&quot; (&#x27;I&#x27;) vs. BGoth , CGoth &quot;Mycha&quot; (&#x27;sword&#x27;) vs. BGoth .

<doc id="473437" wikidata="Q185002" url="?curid=473437" title="Mylène Farmer">
<text>Mylène Jeanne Gautier (; born 12 September 1961), known professionally as Mylène Farmer (), is a French singer and songwriter. Having sold more than 30 million records worldwide, she is among the most successful recording artists of all time in France, where she holds the record for the most number one hit singles, with twenty-one – eight of which were consecutive.

Born in Pierrefonds, Quebec, Canada (a former city now part of the Montreal borough of Pierrefonds-Roxboro), to French parents, the family soon relocated to Chaville, near Paris, where Farmer pursued a career in modelling and acting. She later gained prominence as a recording artist with the release of her debut single &quot;Maman a tort&quot; in 1984. In 1988, she released her second studio album, &quot;Ainsi soit je...&quot;, which sold 1.5 million copies in France. The album spawned Farmer&#x27;s first number one on the French singles chart, &quot;Pourvu qu&#x27;elles soient douces&quot;. Her third studio album, &quot;L&#x27;autre...&quot;, sold two million copies, becoming Farmer&#x27;s best-selling album to date. Its lead single, &quot;Désenchantée&quot;, became Farmer&#x27;s most successful single, and is often described as her signature song.

Departing from the synth-pop and Europop soundscape of her first albums, Farmer reinvented her musical style with the release of her fourth studio album, &quot;Anamorphosée&quot;, in 1995. Recorded in the United States, the album features more live instrumentation and shows rock and R&amp;B-oriented influences. Her fifth studio album, &quot;Innamoramento&quot;, was released in 1999, featuring more electronic influences. In the second part of the 2000s, Farmer continued exploring a range of genres on her albums, namely acoustic pop music on &quot;Avant que l&#x27;ombre...&quot; and electronica on &quot;Point de suture&quot;.

In 2010, Farmer released her eighth studio album, &quot;Bleu noir&quot;. The album marked Farmer&#x27;s return to the dark synth-pop and Europop production of her first albums. The lead single, &quot;Oui mais... non&quot;, sold over 130,000 copies in France. In 2015, Farmer&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;Interstellaires&quot;, debuted at number one in France; the album was preceded by the lead single &quot;Stolen Car&quot;, a duet with Sting, which reached the number one position on the French singles chart in September 2015. Her eleventh studio album, &quot;Désobéissance&quot;, was released in 2018, debuting at number one and selling over 265.000 copies.

In addition to her music career, Farmer also worked as a lyricist for French singer Alizée, while also being responsible for her image and public appearances. Her debut single, &quot;Moi... Lolita&quot;, co-written by Farmer, reached number one in several countries in Europe, and peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart in February 2002. Farmer made her film debut in 1994, starring in &quot;Giorgino&quot;, and in 2018, she starred in the English-language horror film &quot;Ghostland&quot;.

Throughout her career, Farmer has broken a number of records. She is the best-selling French singer since 1984, has a record number of diamond records, and she is the only artist to have obtained a diamond album in four consecutive decades. Selling over two million copies, her 2001 greatest hits album &quot;Les Mots&quot; is the highest-selling compilation album by a French recording artist.

==Biography and career==

=== 1961–1983: early years and career beginnings ===
Having been born in Canada, her family relocated to France when Farmer was eight years old. When she first arrived in France, she took speech classes after her school declared her Québécois accent to be &quot;improper&quot;. At the age of 17, Farmer discovered acting and undertook a three-year course at the Cours Florent, a drama school in Paris. Changing her name to Mylène Farmer as a tribute to her idol, 1930s Hollywood actress Frances Farmer, she began to earn a living as a model acting in several TV adverts, such as those for IKEA, Fiskars and Caisse d&#x27;Epargne. Farmer also appeared in a local stage production of &quot;Le père Noël est une ordure&quot;.

In 1984, Farmer met Laurent Boutonnat, a young film student, after answering a newspaper advert for an actress for a small film project he was working on. Farmer and Boutonnat became friends and forged a creative partnership, writing and producing the music. Boutonnat, whose ambition was to become a film director, became the creative force behind Farmer&#x27;s videos. In 1984, Farmer recorded and released the song &quot;Maman a tort&quot;, written by Boutonnat and Jérôme Dahan. The trio continued to work together on what would become Farmer&#x27;s first studio album.

=== 1984–1992: &quot;Cendres de lune,&quot; &quot;Ainsi soit je...&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;autre...&quot; ===
Farmer&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Cendres de lune&quot;, was released in 1986. During the recording process, it was decided that Farmer would write lyrics and Boutonnat would write music and direct the music videos. &quot;Libertine&quot; was released as the lead single of the album, accompanied by a music video in the style of a short film, inspired by 19th century literature.

In 1988, Boutonnat and Farmer started work on her sophomore album, &quot;Ainsi soit je...&quot;. The album sold 1.5 million copies in France and spawned Farmer&#x27;s first number one on the French singles chart, &quot;Pourvu qu&#x27;elles soient douces&quot;. The album also features the songs &quot;Sans contrefaçon&quot; and the Juliette Gréco cover &quot;Déshabillez-moi&quot;. &quot;Ainsi soit je...&quot; was the best-selling female album of the 1980s in France.

Following the positive response to small-scale concerts at the Palais de Sport, Farmer agreed to embark on a 50-date tour throughout francophone Europe in 1989. The tour saw Farmer play in arenas and featured dancers and outfits designed by French fashion designer Thierry Mugler. A live album documenting the tour was released at the end of that year, titled &quot;En Concert&quot;.

Farmer released the song &quot;Désenchantée&quot; in March 1991. An uptempo pop song, &quot;Désenchantée&quot; talks about a disillusioned generation. The song was preceded by a number of demonstrations in Paris, led by high-school students, who were &quot;protest[ing] against overcrowded classrooms, inadequate security and too few teachers&quot;. The song ended up spending nine weeks atop the French singles chart, becoming Farmer&#x27;s most successful single to date and her signature song. The song was also successful in Belgium, where it spent six weeks at number one, and it was a top ten hit in several European countries. Its accompanying music video, shot in Budapest, sees Farmer play a rebelling prisoner in a concentration camp.

Led by the success of &quot;Désenchantée&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;autre...&quot; was released in April 1991. The album spent twenty consecutive weeks on top of the French album charts, becoming Farmer&#x27;s best-selling studio album to date with two million copies sold. The album also charted in Switzerland, Sweden and Germany. To further promote the album, the singles &quot;Regrets&quot;, &quot;Je t&#x27;aime mélancolie&quot; and &quot;Beyond My Control&quot; were released.

1992 saw the release of the remix compilation &quot;Dance Remixes&quot;. It was led by the single &quot;Que mon cœur lâche&quot;, which deals with the topic of AIDS and sexual relations. It was accompanied by a video directed by Luc Besson, in which Farmer plays an angel sent down to earth by God to report on the changing ways people experience love.

=== 1995–2000: &quot;Anamorphosée&quot; and &quot;Innamoramento&quot; ===
In 1994, Farmer starred in the film &quot;Giorgino&quot;, written and directed by Boutonnat. The film received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics and was a box-office bomb. Following this, Farmer relocated to Los Angeles.

While in the U.S., Farmer and Boutonnat started working on her fourth studio album, &quot;Anamorphosée&quot;. The album marked an artistic turn for Farmer, moving away from her early synth-pop music in favour of pop rock, R&amp;B and new jack swing influences. The album was launched by &quot;XXL&quot;, the music video of which was directed by Marcus Nispel and features Farmer strapped to the front of a moving train. To further promote the album, the singles &quot;L&#x27;Instant X&quot;, &quot;California&quot;, &quot;Comme j&#x27;ai mal&quot; and &quot;Rêver&quot; were released. The music video for &quot;California&quot; was directed by American filmmaker Abel Ferrara and features Farmer in a dual role. The album differs lyrically from Farmer&#x27;s previous work: &quot;Rêver&quot; deals with the Holocaust and features a call for tolerance, &quot;XXL&quot; talks about universal love from a feminist perspective, and &quot;L&#x27;Instant X&quot; offers a humorous look at the end of the world.

In summer 1996, Farmer embarked on her second concert tour, during which she performed 21 shows in arenas around France, Belgium and Switzerland. Inspired by American concert tours, Farmer performed the majority of songs from &quot;Anamorphosée&quot;, songs from her previous studio albums, and a cover of &quot;La Poupée qui fait non&quot; with French singer Khaled. The corresponding live album, &quot;Live à Bercy&quot;, was released in May 1997.

Farmer released her fifth studio album &quot;Innamoramento&quot; in 1999. The album was preceded by &quot;L&#x27;Âme-stram-gram&quot;, an uptempo techno song with a music video inspired by the film &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot;. Both the single and the album reached the second position on the French charts. The music video for the second single, &quot;Je te rends ton amour&quot;, sparked controversy because of its religious and transgressive imagery, and was censored by French TV channel M6. Consequently, the video was released on VHS, with the profits donated to French charity Sidaction to support HIV/AIDS research. Furthermore, the singles &quot;Souviens-toi du jour&quot;, &quot;Optimistique-moi&quot; and &quot;Innamoramento&quot; were released in promotion of the album.

In late 1999, Farmer embarked on her third concert tour, the &quot;Mylenium Tour&quot;. The stage of the show featured aerial structures and a pharaonic statue at the centre of the stage. Farmer performed 42 shows in total, including three shows in Russia, her first concerts in a non-French-speaking country. The tour concluded in March 2000.

=== 2000–2007: Alizée, &quot;Les mots&quot; and &quot;Avant que l&#x27;ombre...&quot; ===
In 2000, Farmer and Boutonnat started working on songs and video ideas they felt appropriate for a younger singer. They discovered Alizée Jacotey on the French television show &quot;Graines de stars&quot;. Farmer and Boutonnat wrote and produced Alizée&#x27;s albums &quot;Gourmandises&quot; (2001) and &quot;Mes courants électriques&quot; (2003). In addition, Farmer was also responsible for Alizée&#x27;s image and public appearances. Her debut single, &quot;Moi... Lolita&quot;, written by Farmer, reached number one in several countries in Europe, and peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart in February 2002. It also went on to sell more than one million copies in France. In 2005, after two albums and a concert tour, Alizée amicably parted ways with the duo to work with different songwriters and producers.

In 2001, Farmer recorded &quot;L&#x27;Histoire d&#x27;une fée, c&#x27;est...&quot; for the animated film &quot;Rugrats in Paris: The Movie.&quot; At the end of the year, Universal released Farmer&#x27;s first greatest hits collection: &quot;Les Mots.&quot; &quot;Les Mots&quot; was the best-selling album of 2001 and 2002, and remains the best-selling greatest hits album in France with more than 1.5 million copies sold. The album also featured new tracks, including the title track, a duet with British singer Seal, &quot;C&#x27;est une belle journée&quot; and &quot;Pardonne-moi&quot;.

After a hiatus of four years, Farmer held a press conference in 2005, announcing her new album, &quot;Avant que l&#x27;ombre...,&quot; the single &quot;Fuck Them All&quot;, as well as a special 13-night concert engagement at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy in January 2006. The residency in Bercy featured a complex set designed by Mark Fisher, including two stages, a mobile bridge to link the two stages and a water curtain used to project words and the singer&#x27;s silhouette. A live album and a concert DVD, &quot;Avant que l&#x27;ombre... à Bercy&quot;, were released in December 2006.

Following this, Farmer and American electronic musician Moby worked on the French-language duet version of the singer&#x27;s song &quot;Slipping Away&quot;, with the French lyrics translated by Farmer herself. In 2007, Farmer recorded a song &quot;Devant soi&quot; for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Jacquou le Croquant&quot;, and worked as a voice actress in Luc Besson&#x27;s animated feature &quot;Arthur and the Minimoys&quot;, lending her voice to Princess Selenia. Farmer would later reprise her role in the film&#x27;s two sequels.

=== 2008–2014: &quot;Point de suture&quot;, &quot;Bleu noir&quot; and &quot;Monkey Me&quot; ===
Farmer&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Point de Suture&quot;, was released on 25 August 2008, debuting at number one on the French album chart. Along with its lead single &quot;Dégénération&quot;, the album features more electronic instrumentation and is predominately uptempo. Other singles released from the album include &quot;Appelle mon numéro&quot; and &quot;C&#x27;est dans l&#x27;air&quot;, both of which charted at number one on the French singles chart.
Following the release of the album, Farmer embarked on her fifth concert tour entitled &quot;Mylène Farmer en tournée&quot;. The tour saw Farmer play in stadiums for the first time in her career, giving concerts at the Stade de France, Stade de Genève and King Baudouin Stadium, as well as a number of arenas in France and Russia. A live album, &quot;N°5 on Tour&quot;, was released on 7 December 2009, which was followed by a DVD of her Stade de France concerts.

Farmer recorded a duet with French Chanson singer Line Renaud entitled &quot;C&#x27;est pas l&#x27;heure&quot;. In November 2010, Farmer recorded her vocals for a cover of &quot;Never Tear Us Apart&quot; with Ben Harper for Australian band INXS&#x27;s album &quot;Original Sin&quot;.

2010 also saw the release of Farmer&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Bleu noir&quot;. Produced by RedOne, Moby and British alternative band Archive, it entered the French album chart at number one and remained at the top for three consecutive weeks. It was the 9th best-selling album in France in 2010, with more than 300,000 copies sold in only three weeks. &quot;Oui mais... non&quot;, the album&#x27;s lead single was released in October 2010 and went on to become the singer&#x27;s most successful single since 2002. In promotion of the album, the singles &quot;Bleu Noir&quot; and &quot;Lonely Lisa&quot; were released.

Farmer&#x27;s second greatest hits collection, titled &quot;2001.2011,&quot; was released in late 2011, featuring all singles recorded after 2001&#x27;s &quot;Les Mots&quot;, and a new single titled &quot;Du temps&quot;&quot;.&quot;

In early 2012, Farmer said that she was recording a new album which was to be released late 2012. The lead single, &quot;À l&#x27;ombre&quot; had its radio premiere in October 2012, and the album, &quot;Monkey Me&quot; entered the French charts at number one in December 2012.In support of &quot;Bleu noir&quot; and &quot;Monkey Me&quot;, Farmer embarked on the &quot;Timeless 2013&quot; concert tour, starting in September 2013. More than 500,000 people in total attended the tour, which visited arenas in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Belarus and Russia. The live album of the tour was released in December, with an eponymous film shot in widescreen during the shows in Lyon.

=== 2015–2021: &quot;Interstellaires&quot;, &quot;Désobéissance&quot; and &quot;Histoires de&quot; ===
In 2015, Farmer collaborated with French photographer Sylvie Lancrenon on a coffee table book entitled &quot;Fragile&quot;. Featuring 90 photos of Farmer taken by Lancrenon, the imagery consists of intimate photographs of the singer covered in talc and clay, focusing on the juxtaposition of fragility and powerfulness.

In August 2015, a new site was launched, announcing new material from Farmer. The first single to be released was &quot;Stolen Car&quot;, a duet with Sting, who originally recorded the song for his 2003 album &quot;Sacred Love&quot;. The single reached number one on the French and Belgian (Wallonia) singles chart and also marks Farmer&#x27;s debut on top of &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Dance Club Songs chart. Its parent record, &quot;Interstellaires&quot;, was released on 6 November 2015, becoming Farmer&#x27;s 12th number one album in France. Farmer collaborated with American producer Martin Kierszenbaum and French DJ The Avener on the album, which also features a cover of &quot;I Want You to Want Me&quot;, a song by American rock band Cheap Trick. To promote the album and &quot;Stolen Car&quot; in the U.S., the singer was interviewed on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; accompanied by Sting, and the two also performed a live rendition of the song.

In 2017, it was announced that Farmer had signed a new record deal with Sony Music Entertainment France. In January 2018, the single &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was unveiled, making it her first release under her new label. It was followed up by a duet with American singer-songwriter LP, entitled &quot;N’oublie pas&quot;. The song was co-written by LP, and the video, set in Iceland, marked the artistic return of Farmer&#x27;s long-time collaborator, Laurent Boutonnat. Farmer&#x27;s eleventh studio album, &quot;Désobéissance&quot;, was released in September 2018. The album was commercially and critically successful, topping the French album chart in its first week, and being described as Farmer&#x27;s best album in 15 years.

To promote the albums &quot;Interstellaires&quot; and &quot;Désobéissance&quot;, Farmer began a nine-date concert residency titled &quot;Mylène Farmer 2019&quot; at the Paris La Défense Arena in June 2019. A live album titled &quot;Live 2019&quot; was released in October that year.

In 2020, Farmer and Boutonnat started working with upcoming French singer Julia. Her album &quot;Passe... comme tu sais&quot; was released on 19 June 2020, featuring songs penned by Farmer and produced by Boutonnat.

2020 also saw the premiere of &quot;Mylène Farmer - L&#x27;Ultime Création&quot;, a behind-the-scenes documentary about her 2019 residency concerts. In order to promote the documentary, and a subsequent greatest hits album entitled &quot;Histoires de&quot;, the new single &quot;L&#x27;âme dans l&#x27;eau&quot; was announced, along with a music video consisting of footage from the upcoming documentary. A collection of live and studio recordings between 1984 and 2020, &quot;Histoires de&quot; debuted at number two on the French charts on 4 December 2020.

In 2021, Mylène Farmer became a member of the jury at Cannes Film Festival.

=== 2022–present: Nevermore tour, &quot;L&#x27;Emprise&quot;, &quot;Remix XL&quot; ===

The Nevermore 2023 tour was announced in July 2021 with a series of teasers on Farmer&#x27;s official YouTube channel. It originally consisted of thirteen stadium concerts scheduled in France, Switzerland, and Belgium in June and July 2023. The tour was also planned to go to Russia in August or September 2023 but those plans were dropped in March 2022.

On 13 May 2022, Pascal Nègre, Farmer&#x27;s manager, announced that she was working on a new studio album along with musicians Woodkid, AaRON, Moby and Archive. The first song from that album, &quot;À tout jamais&quot;, was released as a single on 26 August with the music video being released on 12 September. In October, the album&#x27;s name, &quot;L&#x27;Emprise&quot;, was revealed via another set of teasers. The album was released on 25 November and reached the top of the album charts in France, Wallonia, and Switzerland. The album was also followed by three other singles: &quot;Rayon Vert&quot; (a duet with AaRon), &quot;Rallumer Les Etoiles&quot; (composed by Moby), and the title track &quot;L&#x27;Emprise&quot; (composed by Woodkid). &quot;L&#x27;Emprise&quot; is described as a return to the darker instrumentation of her earlier records which incorporates synth-pop, electropop, new wave and baroque pop influences. The instrumentation features predominately violins, synths and drums.

In December 2022, the English rock band Muse released a surprise, bilingual version of &quot;Ghosts (How Can I Move On)&quot; featuring Mylène Farmer singing in duet with Matthew Bellamy. The song received airtime in Great Britain, France, the United States, and other countries. It briefly topped the French singles chart shortly after its release.

The title track for &quot;L&#x27;Emprise&quot; was used as the soundtrack for the closing credits for the French language release of the film &quot;Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves&quot;. Farmer produced a music video for this song that included extracts from the film. The clip debuted at the French premiere of the film in March 2023.

Farmer contributed to Moby&#x27;s &quot;Resound NYC&quot; album by reciting the introduction of Arthur Rimbaud&#x27;s poem &quot;Une saison en enfer&quot; for the instrumental piece &quot;Hyenas&quot;. The album was released 12 May 2023.

The Nevermore 2023 stadium tour started in Lille on 3 June. The concerts scheduled for the Stade de France on 30 June and 1 July were cancelled hours before the first one was to start due to the Nahel Merzouk riots. The performances were subsequently rescheduled for 27 and 28 September 2024. The lengthy delay was caused by the stadium not being available before then due to the 2024 Summer Olympic games and other events. A third show at the Stade de France on 1 October 2024 was also added to the tour schedule. It is expected that the rescheduled shows will feature the same decor, team members and setlist.

&quot;Remix XL&quot; was released on 19 April 2024. It contains 20 remixes ranging from the classic songs to recent ones, and features brand new remix version of &quot;Désenchantée&quot; by the DJ Feder, which was released digitally as the first single of the album in February. The singer also re-recorded her vocals for some of the tracks on the album.

== Artistry ==
Farmer&#x27;s influences include musicians, actors and literary figures. The singer adopted her stage name as an homage to Hollywood actress Frances Farmer, whose character always fascinated her. Other cinematic figures Farmer says she is inspired by include Greta Garbo, Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Spielberg, and Andrei Tarkovsky. In addition, she has named Depeche Mode, Kate Bush and Jacques Brel as musical influences. In turn, Farmer&#x27;s work has influenced a number of French recording artists, including Christine and the Queens, Damso and Gims.

=== Lyrical influences ===
Farmer is known for her poetic songwriting, which often features philosophical ideas, symbolism, transgression, religious imagery, alliterations, double entendres and neologisms. Common topics of her lyrics include sex, death, religion and love. Farmer&#x27;s literary influences include Charles Baudelaire, Edgar Allan Poe, Emily Dickinson, Pierre Reverdy, Stefan Zweig and Søren Kierkegaard.

=== Musical style ===
Musically, Farmer is usually described as a pop and French pop artist; nevertheless, she is known for reinventing her style with every album cycle. All her albums between 1984 and 2008 were produced by her collaborator, Laurent Boutonnat. Her first albums, &quot;Cendres de lune&quot;, &quot;Ainsi soit je...&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;autre...&quot; feature dark synth-pop and new wave instrumentation. 1995 saw the release of &quot;Anamorphosée&quot;, which features more simplistic lyrics and pop rock-influenced music. &quot;Innamoramento&quot; and &quot;Avant que l&#x27;ombre...&quot; are often described as merging acoustic instruments with electronic beats. Farmer then experimented with electronica and club music on 2008&#x27;s &quot;Point de suture&quot;. In 2010, Farmer released her first album without Laurent Boutonnat, &quot;Bleu noir&quot;, featuring songs produced by RedOne, Moby and British alternative band Archive. The album saw Farmer return to the darker synth-pop and Europop production of her debut album. For 2012&#x27;s &quot;Monkey Me&quot;, Farmer collaborated with Boutonnat in the studio one more time. &quot;Interstellaires&quot;, the singer&#x27;s tenth studio album shows influences of pop rock and adult contemporary styles, produced by French DJ The Avener and Martin Kierszenbaum. On &quot;Désobéissance&quot;, Farmer collaborated with French DJ Feder, American singer-songwriter LP and American producer Mike Del Rio, marking a return to electronic dance music. For L&#x27;Emprise, Farmer collaborated with Woodkid to produce a &quot;confidant, and very intimate&quot; album which offers a mix of symphonic music, industrial rhythms, and electropop. Moby, AaRON, and Archive also contributed to the album.

== Public image ==
Farmer eschews being part of a cult of personality and prefers to be recognized for her work. She rarely grants interviews, has no official fan club, does not endorse any unofficial fan clubs, and has no public facing social media accounts.

In 1988, she was presented the Victoire de la musique award for female performer of the year, but refused to sing at the ceremony due to the behind the scenes infighting that she witnessed while rehearsing for the show. This was her only appearance at this award ceremony. Since then, she has only appeared at ceremonies for which awards are decided by the general public.

In November 1991, Laurent Berger, a disturbed man who had been stalking Farmer, entered the Polydor Records headquarters in Paris and held employees at gunpoint demanding to talk to her. After not being granted the singer&#x27;s address, the man killed the receptionist with a gunshot. It is said that the incident contributed to Farmer&#x27;s absence in the media.

Farmer is regarded as a gay icon. Her status has been attributed to her lyrics, which often feature references to homosexual love and sexuality, and her tomboy image early in her career. She publicly accepted her position as a gay icon in 2008 by saying &quot;We&#x27;ve been following each other for many years, that&#x27;s important to me. I also think that I share with the gay public, as with other audiences, the feeling of being &quot;different&quot;, a feeling that causes difficulty to live in this world.&quot;

In January 2015, following the Île-de-France attacks, Farmer declared her support for the Je suis Charlie movement. In March 2020, Farmer&#x27;s management shared her drawing in support of doctors and nurses working in French hospitals amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and another unpublished drawing of hers was later auctioned to support the purchase of protective equipment for caregivers.

==Personal life==
Farmer does not discuss her private life in interviews or on social media. When not on stage, she prefers to stay out of the public eye.

Farmer met American actor, singer and guitarist Jeff Dahlgren on the set of their 1994 movie &quot;Giorgino.&quot; Following the commercial failure of the film, the couple relocated to Los Angeles. Dahlgren played the guitar on the singer&#x27;s 1990s albums &quot;Anamorphosée&quot; and &quot;Innamoramento&quot;, and accompanied her on stage during her &quot;Mylenium Tour&quot;. The couple ended their relationship in 1999.

In 2002, Farmer began a relationship with French director and producer . The couple met while creating the animated music video for Farmer&#x27;s single &quot;C&#x27;est une belle journée&quot;. Di Sabatino also directed the music video for &quot;L&#x27;amour n&#x27;est rien...&quot; in 2006 and &quot;Appelle mon numéro&quot; in 2008.

<text>Torah im Derech Eretz ( – Torah with &quot;the way of the land&quot;) is a phrase common in Rabbinic literature referring to various aspects of one&#x27;s interaction with the wider world. The term also refers to a philosophy of Orthodox Judaism articulated by Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch (1808–1888), which formalizes a relationship between traditionally observant Judaism and the modern world. Some refer to the resultant mode of Orthodox Judaism as Neo-Orthodoxy or, in some historiographies, as Frankfurter Orthodoxy.

==Derech Eretz==
The phrase &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot; is first found in the Mishna in Tractate &quot;Avoth&quot; (2:2): &quot;Beautiful is the study of Torah with &quot;Derech Eretz&quot;, as involvement with both makes one forget sin&quot;. The term &quot;Derech Eretz&quot;, literally &quot;the way of the land&quot;, is inherently ambiguous, with a wide range of meanings in Rabbinic literature, referring to earning a livelihood and behaving appropriately, among others.

===Appropriate behaviour and good character===

In the Talmud and Midrash, there are approximately 200 teachings concerning &quot;Derech Eretz&quot; as decent, polite, respectful, thoughtful, and civilized behavior. One representative teaching is that &quot;&quot;Derech Eretz&quot; comes before Torah&quot; – one cannot personify Torah until he demonstrates &quot;Derech Eretz&quot; in everything that he does.

There are many more such teachings in the rishonim and acharonim (post-Talmudic authorities). The mussar literature, in fact, presents an entire body of thought devoted to the subject of &quot;middot&quot; (character traits) and &quot;behaving like a &quot;mentsh&quot;&quot; (refined human being, lit. &quot;a mature man&quot;). Here, the way that one behaves is regarded as an external manifestation of one&#x27;s &quot;middot&quot;.

Nachman of Breslov takes the words &quot;comes before&quot; (in the above maxim) in a chronologic sense. Thus, &quot;&quot;Derech eretz comes before Torah&quot;,&quot; means that &quot;Derech Eretz&quot; is the original method to know part of the truth, and existed before the gift of the Torah.

===Earning a livelihood===

The meaning of &quot;Derech Eretz&quot; in the above Mishna is generally taken as &quot;earning a livelihood&quot;, and the Mishna is thus read as &quot;Beautiful is the study of Torah combined with &#x27;earning a livelihood&#x27;&quot;. In consonance, Rabbinic opinion has a general requirement for earning a livelihood, but in such a fashion that one may also study and live Torah.
This opinion, in fact, extends to codification in Jewish Law: &quot;[One] should work every day, sufficient for his living... and should busy himself with Torah the rest of the day and night; one who supports himself with his own hands is on a great level&quot;.

The language of this codification is representative of the general value assigned by Rabbinic literature to work in and of itself, and of the simultaneous requirement that work be seen as means to spiritual, and not material, goals. (See also Kohelet Rabbah 1:34). Thus, as formulated in &quot;Pirkei Avot&quot; 4:1:

Rashi, on the verse, similarly states that one who supports himself inherits this world and the next.

At the same time, in this widely quoted Mishna, the requirement to work is clearly presented with a simultaneous warning against materialism. In fact similar teachings are widespread in the Tanakh (&quot;God made one to balance the other&quot; Ecclesiastes 7:14), Midrash, and Rabbinic literature generally.

Even the choice of occupation is circumscribed: The &quot;Mishna Berurah&quot; states that working laymen (בעלי בתים) should ensure that their business activities are secondary to their Torah study, and, regardless, should set aside 3 or 4 hours each day to study—if required, limiting one&#x27;s lifestyle such that this amount of study is possible. The popular Kitzur Shulchan Aruch more generally requires that:
&quot;when you are engaged in business or in a trade [or profession] to earn a livelihood, you should not aspire to accumulate wealth, but pursue your work in order to support your family, to give charity, and to raise your children to study the Torah...&quot; See also .

Rabbinic tradition therefore recognizes that achieving an appropriate balance could pose both practical and philosophic challenges (e.g., the requirement for secular education as opposed to limited vocational training), and the various issues are therefore widely discussed: (i) in various tractates in the Talmud; (ii) in the halakhic literature; (iii) as well as in Jewish philosophy, Hasidic thought and Musar (ethical) literature—see discussion under Divine providence in Judaism.
In Kabbalistic and Chassidic thought, also, work is seen as having positive value: Thirty-Nine Acts of Labor, encompassing all the types of work, were necessary in order to build the Tabernacle. Work became a necessity when Adam ate from the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil, causing the sparks of holiness to fall to the Other Side. All our work, regardless of its spiritual or material purpose, serves to rebuild those Shattered Vessels. One who conducts his work or business honorably is considered as though he builds the Tabernacle.

===Knowledge of the natural world===

Maharal, Judah Loew (1525–1609), points out that &quot;Derech Eretz&quot; is not limited to &quot;earning a living&quot;; rather, the concept encompasses &quot;hanhaga tiv`it&quot;, &quot;operating in the natural world&quot;. Here, Maharal in his &quot;Derech Chaim&quot; comments on the later Mishna, &quot;Avoth&quot; 3:21, which discusses the interdependence of &quot;Torah and flour (&quot;kemakh&quot;)&quot; as well as the interdependence of &quot;Torah and &quot;Derech Eretz&quot;&quot;. &quot;Kemakh&quot;, flour, clearly refers to monetary livelihood (with Torah referring to spiritual livelihood). Thus, &quot;Derech Eretz&quot; refers to more than just &quot;earning a livelihood&quot; and includes the knowledge and skills that facilitate success in the &quot;world of Nature&quot;. See.

===Knowledge of culture and society===

Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch (1808–1888), incorporating the above, was among the first to extend the definition of &quot;Derech Eretz&quot; to include a broad knowledge of, and appropriate interaction with, culture and society. Hirsch states that:
:&quot;&quot;Derech Eretz&quot; includes everything that results from the fact that man&#x27;s existence, mission and social life are conducted on Earth, using earthly means and conditions. Therefore this term especially describes ways of earning a livelihood and maintaining the social order. It also includes the customs and considerations of etiquette that the social order generates as well as everything concerning humanistic and civil education.&quot; (commentary on &quot;Pirkei Avot&quot;) 
Hirsch&#x27;s conception also entails the qualification that there be no compromise on strict adherence to Jewish law. The resultant philosophy of Orthodox Judaism in the modern world, referred to as &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot;, is discussed below.

==Rabbi S.R. Hirsch==

When Hirsch first came to Frankfurt in 1851, he proclaimed &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot; as the &quot;banner&quot; for his congregation, the &quot;Israelitische Religionsgesellschaft &quot; — the phrase has since been synonymous with Hirsch as well as with his philosophy. As seen, Hirsch was not unique in extending &quot;Derech Eretz&quot; to include broad knowledge of the secular world; rather, his role was to formalize a philosophy of &quot;Derech Eretz&quot; that incorporated a practical response to modernity. 
Hirsch&#x27;s philosophy has been variously interpreted within Orthodoxy.

===Hirsch&#x27;s &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot;===
In Hirsch&#x27;s view, &quot;Derech Eretz&quot; refers not only to livelihood, but also to the social order, with the associated mores and considerations of courtesy and propriety, as well as to general education. Hirsch thus developed the concept of &quot;Derech Eretz&quot; to embrace Western culture while maintaining strict adherence to Jewish law (see and ).

====Worldly involvement====

Hirsch seeks to demonstrate in all his writings that the combination of Torah and &quot;Derech Eretz&quot; is not only possible but necessary if Judaism is to dominate not only the religious sphere of personal and communal life, but the secular, mundane sphere as well. To Hirsch, the fulfillment of Torah—&quot;Derech Eretz&quot;—therefore requires worldly involvement and general participation in society, as facilitated by the requisite knowledge.
:&quot;Judaism is not a mere adjunct to life: it comprises all of life. To be a Jew is not a mere part, it is the sum total of our task in life. To be a Jew in the synagogue and the kitchen, in the field and the warehouse, in the office and the pulpit ... with the needle and the graving-tool, with the pen and the chisel—that is what it means to be a Jew.&quot; (&quot;Religion Allied to Progress&quot;)

====Secular culture and education====
In Hirsch&#x27;s view, Judaism must &quot;include the conscientious promotion of education and culture&quot;. Hirsch speaks of the &quot;Mensch-Yisroel&quot; (&quot;Israel-man&quot;), the &quot;enlightened religious personality&quot; as an ideal: that is the Jew who is proudly Jewish, a believer in the eternal values of the Torah, but also possessing the ability to engage with and influence contemporary culture and knowledge.
:&quot;The more, indeed, Judaism comprises the whole of man and extends its declared mission to the salvation of the whole of mankind, the less it is possible to confine its outlook to the synagogue. [Thus] the more the Jew is a Jew, the more universalist will be his views and aspirations [and] the less aloof will he be from ... art or science, culture or education ... [and] the more joyfully will he applaud whenever he sees truth and justice and peace and the ennoblement of man.&quot; (&quot;Religion Allied to Progress&quot;)

====Jewish law====
Importantly, Hirsch was very clear that &quot;Derech Eretz&quot; in no sense allows for halakhic compromise. In his view, Judaism is &quot;an untouchable sanctuary which must not be subjected to human judgment nor subordinated to human considerations&quot; and &quot;progress is valid only to the extent that it does not interfere with religion&quot;. He states that &quot;the Jew will not want to accomplish anything that he cannot accomplish as a Jew. Any step which takes him away from Judaism is not for him a step forward, is not progress. He exercises this self-control without a pang, for he does not wish to accomplish his own will on earth but labours in the service of God.&quot; In &quot;The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel&quot; Hirsch remarked that it would have been better for the Jews not to have been emancipated if the price they had to pay was assimilation. (See also, Modern Orthodox Judaism#Standards of observance.)

===Interpretation===
:&quot;See also the discussion on this point, in the article on Rabbi Hirsch.&quot;

As mentioned, the philosophy of &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot; has been variously interpreted within Orthodoxy. The range of interpretations arises particularly in light of the tension between Hirsch&#x27;s insistence as to faithfulness to Jewish law and tradition, and the challenges posed to this by interaction with the secular world.

Under a &quot;narrow interpretation&quot;, exposure to secular philosophy, music, art, literature, or ethics must be functional. Under a &quot;median interpretation&quot;, this exposure is permissible, and even required, for the sake of the domination of Torah values over one&#x27;s worldly matters. Under a &quot;broad interpretation&quot; this exposure is permissible, providing a complement to—and even a synthesis with—Torah.

Thus as regards involvement in the secular world, the &quot;narrow interpretation&quot; essentially restricts &quot;Derech Eretz&quot; to a gainful occupation; permissible knowledge would be limited to functional and occupation related knowledge, and (possibly) secular knowledge that enables one to better interpret and understand the Torah. The &quot;median interpretation&quot; encourages the study of secular knowledge, but only insofar as this permits application of a Torah outlook and philosophy to human knowledge and culture. The &quot;broad interpretation&quot; permits the general acquisition of secular culture and knowledge as valuable in its own right.
Hirsch himself appears to have embraced the &quot;median interpretation&quot;, albeit with the qualifications above. He states that &quot;&quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot;, as used by our sages, means the realization of Torah in harmonious unity with all the conditions under which its laws will have to be observed amidst the developments of changing times&quot; (&quot;Gesammelte Schriften&quot; vii p. 294). Thus on a regular basis, he quotes secular scientists in his Torah commentary. Some scholars believe that he was influenced by Hegel (1770–1831) and Friedrich Schiller (1759–1805); in fact, in a speech given in the school he founded on the centenary of the birth of the latter, he claimed that the universalistic principles of Western culture embodied in Schiller&#x27;s writings are Jewish values originating in the Torah.

On the other hand, Hirsch cautioned as to the danger of scientific knowledge leading one away from God; further, his schools, unlike others in Germany at the time, taught modern (business) languages as opposed to classical languages. Famously, in his commentary to Leviticus 18:4-5 (see also Rashi &quot;ad loc.&quot;), Hirsch clearly delineates the relationship of secular knowledge and Torah, where Torah is &quot;&quot;ikkar&quot; (עיקר), the essential, while secular knowledge is &quot;tefel&quot;&quot; (טפל), secondary or supplementary to Torah. He states that &quot;[w]e are confident that there is only one truth, and only one body of knowledge that can serve as the standard. ... Compared to it, all the other sciences are valid only provisionally&quot;.

His commentary on Deuteronomy 6:7 is perhaps more explicit:
:&quot;The study of the Torah shall be our main intellectual pursuit. ... We are not to study Torah from the standpoint of another science or for the sake of that science. So, too, we are to be careful not to introduce into the sphere of the Torah foreign ideas. ... Rather, we should always be mindful of the superiority of the Torah, which differs from all other scientific knowledge through its Divine origin. ... [Our Sages] do not demand of us to completely ignore all the scientific knowledge ... [but rather] that a person [be] familiar with these other realms of knowledge, but ... only from the Torah&#x27;s perspective ... and they warn us that neglecting this perspective will jeopardize our intellectual life.&quot;

===Neo-Orthodoxy: the &quot;Breuer&quot; communities===
In 1851, Hirsch was called to become the rabbi of the breakaway Orthodox community of Frankfurt am Main. This community soon became the model for &quot;modern communities&quot; strict in adherence to Orthodox practices, sometimes called, &quot;Frankfurter Orthodoxy&quot;. Hirsch&#x27;s son-in-law Rabbi Dr. Shlomo Zalman (Solomon) Breuer, succeeded him after his death. Wary of establishing a dynasty, the Frankfurt community did not appoint Hirsch&#x27;s son to be his successor.

After World War I, in order to show their rejection of religious liberalism, followers of the community started to call themselves &quot;Neo-Orthodox&quot;; this mirrored the parallel movement in Lutheranism (called &quot;Neo-Orthodoxy&quot;). Thus, at this point, Hirsch&#x27;s romantic liberalism and the values of the 1848 struggle for civil rights were less relevant – and the rejection of many elements of Weimar German culture was prevalent. Solomon Breuer and Isaac Breuer were leaders of this conservative turn by the community.

Following Kristallnacht, Breuer and his family emigrated to Antwerp, and then to New York City. Once in New York, Breuer started a congregation among the numerous German refugees in Washington Heights, which closely followed the customs and mores of the Frankfurt community. The congregation, Khal Adath Yeshurun, is colloquially known as &quot;Breuer&#x27;s&quot;. Rabbi Shimon Schwab, also a native of Frankfurt, served as the second Rabbi of the &quot;Breuer&quot; community, until his death in 1995. Solomon Breuer and Joseph Breuer are often regarded as Hirsch&#x27;s intellectual heirs, while Schwab is regarded as aligned with the more traditional Lithuanian orthodox communities.

The Breuer community has cautiously applied &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot; to American life, narrowing its application over time. Schwab warned of the dangers of contemporary moral attitudes in secular culture and literature, and emphasized that followers of Neo-Orthodoxy therefore require a strong basis of faith and knowledge, and must exercise caution in engagements with the secular world.

Schwab also frequently emphasized that Torah can never be regarded as parallel with the secular knowledge. &quot;Torah study is the highest duty of the Jew&quot;, and &quot;even to suggest that anything can be parallel to Torah is a blasphemy of the highest order; Torah is above all, and everything else in life must be conducted in accordance with the Written and Oral Torah.&quot; Still, entry into commerce or the professions is seen as a valid component of Torah life, to be facilitated by an appropriate secular education (with the caveat that campus life is &quot;incontestably immoral&quot;). &quot;Carrying on one&#x27;s professional life in consonance with the &quot;halakha&quot; is in itself a practice of Torah.&quot; One must &quot;establish the Torah&#x27;s primacy over the modes of business and professional life so that his behavior transforms even that &#x27;mundane&#x27; portion of his life into a sanctification.&quot;

The community is positioned ideologically outside of both Modern Orthodoxy and Haredi Judaism (&quot;Ultra-Orthodoxy&quot;). As regards Haredi Judaism, Schwab acknowledged that although Neo-Orthodoxy is not the path openly espoused by the majority of today&#x27;s &quot;Roshei Yeshiva&quot;, the &quot;Torah Only&quot; and &quot;Torah Im Derech Eretz&quot; camps can exist side-by-side. &quot;As long as one is prompted solely by &quot;Yiras Shamayim&quot; (&quot;fear of Heaven&quot;) and a search for truth, each individual has a choice as to which school he should follow.&quot; Practically, the community is fully engaged with haredi Agudath Yisrael of America, while it shuns the more modern Orthodox Union.

The movement is somewhat distant from Modern Orthodoxy. Schwab regards Modern Orthodoxy as having misinterpreted Hirsch&#x27;s ideas: regarding standards of &quot;halakha&quot; as well as the relative emphasis of Torah versus secular; see discussion under Torah Umadda. Further, Breuer, influenced by Hirsch&#x27;s philosophy on &quot;Austritt&quot; (secession), &quot;could not countenance recognition of a non-believing body as a legitimate representative of the Jewish people&quot;. For this reason, he was &quot;unalterably opposed to the &quot;Mizrachi&quot; movement, which remained affiliated with the World Zionist Organization and the Jewish Agency&quot;.

===Contemporary influence===
&quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot; remains influential as a philosophy in Orthodox Judaism. Although usually associated with the &quot;Breuer&quot; community of Washington Heights, the philosophy remains an important influence in Modern Orthodox Judaism and, to some extent, in &quot;Haredi Judaism&quot;. (See also Divine Providence for discussion of &quot;derech eretz&quot; in contemporary Orthodox Judaism.)

====Modern Orthodoxy====
&quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot; is a major source of ideology for Modern Orthodoxy, particularly regarding the synthesis of Judaism and secular culture. Organizations on the left of Modern Orthodoxy have embraced the &quot;broad interpretation&quot;, although critics say that, philosophical issues aside, their &quot;relatively relaxed stance&quot; in &quot;halakha&quot; in fact positions them outside the realm of &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot;.

Further to the right, the &quot;broad interpretation&quot; is largely identical with &quot;Torah Umadda&quot;—Torah and secular knowledge—a philosophy of Modern Orthodoxy closely associated with Yeshiva University, which aims at synthesizing Torah learning and secular knowledge within the personality. The two are nevertheless distinct in terms of emphasis. Under &quot;Torah Umadda&quot;, &quot;[w]e prefer to look upon science and religion as separate domains...&quot; (Samuel Belkin, inaugural address, 1943), whereas &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot;, aims at the domination of Torah over secular knowledge and the application of Torah thought to secular knowledge. See further under &quot;Torah Umadda&quot;.

====Neo-Orthodoxy====
As above, the &quot;Breuer&quot; community continues to closely apply the philosophy. However, since World War II, the community, has moved away from the &quot;median interpretation&quot; toward the &quot;narrow interpretation&quot;, as above. Rabbi Breuer saw the risk of misinterpretation of his grandfather&#x27;s ideas (and confusion with Torah Umadda) especially post-war. He repeatedly stated that compromising on Jewishness and &quot;halakha&quot; was at variance with &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot;, and emphasized the distinction between Modern Orthodoxy and Neo-Orthodoxy as regards the relationship between Torah and secular. &quot;Rabbi Hirsch&#x27;s fight was not for balance and not for reconcilement, nor for synthesis and certainly not for parallel power, but for domination – for the true and absolute domination of the divine precept over the new tendencies&quot; (Isaac Breuer, Hirsch&#x27;s grandson). See further in the article on Rabbi Hirsch and additionally under Modern Orthodoxy.

====Haredi Judaism====

Today, the Haredi &quot;Yeshiva communities&quot; adhere to the &quot;narrow interpretation&quot; as an educational philosophy. &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot; was the basic idea that shaped the curriculum of the Beis Yaakov school system, and continues to be influential. (In fact, in her Seminary in Kraków, Sarah Schenirer taught Rav Hirsch&#x27;s writings in German. The (German-born) teachers spoke German and the Polish students learned German.) Similarly, the &quot;narrow interpretation&quot; guides the curricula at boys&#x27; high schools.

Other Haredi communities, the &quot;Torah only&quot; school, are further distant from &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot;. Since World War II there has been an ideological tendency in that camp to devote all intellectual capabilities to Torah study only—in schools, &quot;yeshivot&quot; and &quot;kollels&quot;. Thus, the optimum course to be adopted in all cases is to devote oneself to full-time Torah learning for as long as possible; &quot;to go out into the world is a course to be adopted only when there is no other alternative&quot;. Here, the Hirschian model is seen as &quot;horaat sha&#x27;ah&quot;, a &quot;time-specific teaching&quot; intended to apply to the special circumstances of Western Europe in the 1800s. (Note that Hirsch himself addressed this contention: &quot;&quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot; ... is not part of troubled, time-bound notions; it represents the ancient, traditional wisdom of our sages that has stood the test everywhere and at all times.&quot; (&quot;Gesammelte Schriften&quot; vi p. 221); see further under Joseph Breuer.)

<text>Santa Rosa, officially the City of Santa Rosa (), is a component city in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, its population was 414,812 people.

It is the second largest local government unit in Laguna after Calamba. On August 28, 2019, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11395, which separated the city from the province&#x27;s first district and granted the city its own congressional district to elect a representative in 2022. However, for the purposes of electing Sangguniang Panlalawigan members, Santa Rosa remains part of the province&#x27;s first Sangguniang Panlalawigan District.

Santa Rosa was initially known for the Coca-Cola, RC Cola, and Toyota manufacturing plants in its industrial estates. It later became popular as the site of local theme park Enchanted Kingdom and several housing and commercial developments.

==Etymology==
Santa Rosa is derived from Spanish for Saint Rose of Lima, its patron saint to whom it is consecrated to.

== History ==

In 1571, Spanish &quot;conquistador&quot; Juan de Salcedo, the grandson of Miguel López de Legazpi, founded the town of Biñan which was annexed as a barrio to Tabuco (now Cabuyao) while exploring the region of Laguna de Bay.

In 1688, Biñan, together with Barrio Bukol, separated from Cabuyao. After a series of renaming and separating barrios to become independent towns, Barrio Bukol was politically emancipated as the municipality of Santa Rosa, founded on January 18, 1792.

During the revolutionary period in 1898, the town was instrumental in the proclamation of Philippine independence from Spain when the country signed the Act of Independence on June 12, 1898. Later on, the town&#x27;s local revolutionaries fought alongside the forces of Pío del Pilar during the Philippine–American War.
On February 5, 1945, the town was abandoned by Japanese soldiers when the local guerrilla resistance movement, with support from the American and Filipino military contingent, entered the town, where skirmishes, torture, and deaths occurred.

During the postwar era up until the 1970s, the townspeople primarily depended on basic agriculture and family-owned enterprises for their livelihood. The influence of industrialization grew in the 1980s with the entry of local and foreign investors who were responsible for the fast-paced economic and social transformation of the town and the province.

=== Cityhood ===

On July 10, 2004, Santa Rosa was converted into a city by Republic Act No. 9264, which was approved by voters in the plebiscite. Leon Arcillas, who began his third and final term ten days before, became its first city mayor.

===Contemporary===
Arcillas was assassinated at the former city hall by three assailants. They were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2013. Jose Catindig Jr., who served as vice mayor, became mayor to serve out the remainder of his term. On May 14, 2007, Catindig, who ran for his full term as mayor, was defeated by Arcillas&#x27; daughter Arlene.

<text>Bagle (also known as Beagle) was a mass-mailing computer worm affecting Microsoft Windows. The first strain, Bagle.A, did not propagate widely. A second variant, Bagle.B, was considerably more virulent.

== Overview ==
Bagle used its own SMTP engine to mass-mail itself as an attachment to recipients gathered from the infected computer by combing through all of the computer&#x27;s .htm, .html, .txt, and .wab files for any email addresses. It does not mail itself to addresses containing certain strings such as &quot;@hotmail.com&quot;, &quot;@msn.com&quot;, &quot;@microsoft&quot;, &quot;@avp&quot;, or “.r1”. Bagle pretends to be a different file type (a 15,872 byte Windows Calculator for Bagle.A and an 11,264 byte audio file for Bagle.B), with a randomized name, and it will then open that file type as a cover for opening its own .exe file. It copies itself to the Windows system directory (Bagle.A as , Bagle.B as ), adds HKCU run keys to the registry, and opens a backdoor on a TCP port (6777 for Bagle.A and 8866 for Bagle.B). Using an HTTP GET request, Bagle.B also informs the virus&#x27;s programmer that the machine has been successfully infected. Bagle variants, including Bagle.A and Bagle.B, generally have a date at which they stop spreading included in their programming. Computers infected with older versions of Bagle are updated when newer ones are released.

== History ==
The initial strain, Bagle.A, was first sighted on January 18, 2004, seemingly originating in Australia. The original file name for the Bagle virus was Beagle, but computer scientists decided to call it Bagle instead as a way to spite Bagle&#x27;s programmer. Although it started strong with more than 120,000 infected computers, it quickly dwindled in efficacy. Sometimes accompanied by Trojan.Mitglieder.C, it stopped spreading after January 28, 2004, as designed.

The second strain, Bagle.B, was first sighted on February 17, 2004. It was much more widespread and appeared in large numbers; Network Associates rated it a &quot;medium&quot; threat. It was designed to stop spreading after February 25, 2004.

At one point in 2004, the Bagle and Netsky viruses exchanged insults and harsh words with each other in their codes, beginning with Bagle.I on March 3, 2004. Notably, Bagle.J contained the message “Hey, NetSky, fuck off you bitch, don&#x27;t ruine our bussiness, wanna start a war?”, and Netsky-R included, &quot;Yes, true, you have understand it. Bagle is a shitty guy, he opens a backdoor and he makes a lot of money. Netsky not, Netsky is Skynet, a good software, Good guys behind it. Believe me, or not. We will release thousands of our Skynet versions, as long as bagle is there ...&quot;. Additionally, Bagle and Netsky both tried to remove each other from an infected system.

Subsequent variants have later been discovered. By July 26, 2004, there were 35 variants of Bagle, and by April 22, 2005, that number had increased to over 100. Although they have not all been successful, a number remain notable threats. Additionally, on July 3 and 4, 2004, Bagle.AD and Bagle.AE were released, with the source code for the virus, written in Assembly, visibly appearing in both of them.

Some of these variants contain the following text: 
 &quot;Greetz to antivirus companies
 In a difficult world, 
 In a nameless time, 
 I want to survive, 
 So, you will be mine!! 
 -- Bagle Author, 29.04.04, Germany.&quot;
This has led some to believe that the worm originated in Germany.

Since 2004, the threat risk from these variants has been changed to &quot;low&quot; due to decreased prevalence. However, Windows users are warned to watch out for it.

==Botnet==

The Bagle botnet (Initial discovery early 2004), also known by its aliases Beagle, Mitglieder and Lodeight, is a botnet mostly involved in proxy-to-relay e-mail spam.

The Bagle botnet consists of an estimated 150,000-230,000 computers infected with the Bagle Computer worm. It was estimated that the botnet was responsible for about 10.39% of the worldwide spam volume on December 29, 2009, with a surge up to 14% on New Year&#x27;s Day, though the actual percentage seems to rise and drop rapidly. As of April 2010 it is estimated that the botnet sends roughly 5.7 billion spam messages a day, or about 4.3% of the global spam volume.

<text>Bernard Bosanquet (; 14 June 1848 – 8 February 1923) was an English philosopher and political theorist, and an influential figure on matters of political and social policy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His work influenced but was later subject to criticism by many thinkers, notably Bertrand Russell, John Dewey, William James and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Bernard was the husband of Helen Bosanquet, the leader of the Charity Organisation Society.

==Life==
Born at Rock Hall near Alnwick, Bosanquet was the son of Robert William Bosanquet, a Church of England clergyman. He was educated at Harrow School and Balliol College, Oxford. He gained first class honours in Classical Moderations (Greek and Latin), 1868, and in Literae Humaniores (a combination of philosophy and ancient history), 1870. After graduation, he was elected to a Fellowship at University College, Oxford, but, after receiving a substantial inheritance upon the death of his father in 1880, resigned it in order to devote himself to philosophical research. He moved to London in 1881, where he became an active member of the London Ethical Society and the Charity Organisation Society. Both were positive demonstrations of Bosanquet&#x27;s ethical philosophy. Bosanquet published on a wide range of topics, such as logic, metaphysics, aesthetics and political philosophy. In his metaphysics, he is regarded as a key representative (with F. H. Bradley) of absolute idealism, although it is a term that he abandoned in favour of &quot;speculative philosophy&quot;.

He was one of the leaders of the so-called neo-Hegelian philosophical movement in Great Britain. He was strongly influenced by Plato and Aristotle, but also by the German philosophers Immanuel Kant and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Among his best-known works are &quot;The Philosophical Theory of the State&quot; (1899), his Gifford lectures, &quot;The Principle of Individuality and Value&quot; (1912) and &quot;The Value and Destiny of the Individual&quot; (1913).

Bosanquet was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1894 to 1898.

==Idealist social theory==

In his &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;, Section 95, Hegel had written about &quot;the ideality of the finite.&quot; This obscure, seemingly meaningless, phrase was interpreted as implying that &quot;what is finite is not real&quot; because the ideal is understood as being the opposite of the real. Bosanquet was a follower of Hegel and the &quot;central theme of Bosanquet&#x27;s idealism was that every finite existence necessarily transcends itself and points toward other existences and finally to the whole. Thus, he advocated a system very close to that in which Hegel had argued for the ideality of the finite.&quot;

The relation of the finite individual to the whole state in which he or she lives was investigated in Bosanquet&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Theory of the State&quot; (London, 1899). In this book, he &quot;argued that the state is the real individual and that individual persons are unreal by comparison with it.&quot; But Bosanquet did not think that the state has a right to impose social control over its individual citizens. &quot;On the contrary, he believed that if society is organic and individual, then its elements can cooperate apart from a centralised organ of control, the need for which presupposes that harmony has to be imposed upon something that is naturally unharmonious.&quot;

The relationship between the individual and society was summarised in Bosanquet&#x27;s preface to &quot;The Introduction to Hegel&#x27;s Philosophy of Fine Art&quot; (1886):

<text>La Chasse-galerie, also known as &quot;The Bewitched Canoe&quot; or &quot;The Flying Canoe&quot;, is a popular French-Canadian tale of lumberjacks from camps working around the Gatineau River who make a deal with the devil, a variant of the Wild Hunt. Its best-known version was written by Honoré Beaugrand (1848–1906). It was published in &quot;The Century Magazine&quot; in August 1892.

== Origin ==
The story has origins in a French legend about a rich nobleman named Gallery who loved to hunt. He loved it so much that he refused to attend Sunday mass. As punishment for this sin he was condemned to fly forever through the night skies, chased by galloping horses and howling wolves, in a fashion reminiscent of the Wild Hunt stories. 

When French settlers arrived in Canada, they swapped stories with the natives and the tale of Gallery was combined with a First Nations legend about a flying canoe. In time, bark canoes became associated with French-Canadian culture as well; when some of the earliest French-Canadians arrived in New York City, they were reported to have landed on the banks of the Hudson River to &quot;the amazement and admiration of the people, who had never seen bark canoes in their waters before&quot;.

== Variations ==
After a night of heavy drinking on New Year&#x27;s Eve, a group of voyageurs working at a remote timber camp yearn to visit their sweethearts some away. The only way to make such a long journey, and be back in time for work the next morning, is to run the &quot;chasse-galerie&quot;. Running the &quot;chasse-galerie&quot; means making a pact with the Devil so that their canoe can travel through the air to their destination quickly. However, the travellers must not mention God&#x27;s name or touch the cross of any church steeple as they whisk by in the flying canoe. If either of these rules is broken during the voyage, then the Devil will take their souls. This in mind, the men promise not to touch another drop of rum, to keep their heads clear. The crew take their places in the canoe which begins to rise off the ground. They start to paddle. Far below they see the frozen Gatineau River, many villages, plenty of shiny church steeples and even the lights of Montreal. The bewitched canoe eventually touches down near a house where New Year&#x27;s Eve festivities are in full swing. No one questions the trappers&#x27;/loggers&#x27; sudden arrival. They are embraced with open arms and soon are dancing and celebrating as merrily as everyone else. After spending time with their sweethearts and enjoying the festivities, the men notice it is late and know they must leave if they are to get back to camp in time for work. As they fly through the moonless night, it becomes apparent that their navigator had been drinking as he steers the canoe on a dangerously unsteady course. While passing over Montreal, they narrowly miss running into a church steeple, and soon after the canoe ends up stuck in a deep snowdrift. The drunken navigator starts swearing and taking the Lord&#x27;s name in vain. Terrified the devil will take their souls, the men bind and gag their friend and elect another to steer. The navigator soon breaks his bonds and begins swearing again. The crew become more and more shaken at the possibility of losing their souls, and they accidentally steer the bewitched canoe right into a tall pine. The men spill out of the canoe, and are knocked unconscious. 

The ending of the story changes from version to version. In some versions, the men are sentenced to fly the canoe through Hell. They appear in the sky every New Year&#x27;s Eve but, in all but one version, all the men escape the terms the devil (Lucifer) made.

Several different versions of this legend exist. An Acadian version involves an axe handle. It stretches to accommodate as many as climb on.

Another variation has the devil himself steering and deliberately trying to break the rules on the return journey, at which point they throw him out of the canoe to save themselves.

In English, this particular legend is known as &quot;The Canoe&quot;, or &quot;The Wild Hunt Bewitched&quot;. The second name is used to translate precisely &quot;chasse-galerie&quot; as it is known in Canadian French; the other term is much broader.

In Quebec, the best-known version is written by Honoré Beaugrand. This is the story of the Gatineau loggers who make a pact with the devil in order to steal a boat so they can visit their women. They are warned, however, not to blaspheme during the voyage, or touch crosses atop church steeples, and they must be back before six o&#x27;clock the next morning. Otherwise they would lose their souls. In his version, the devil (Lucifer) is rather generous, and allows the men to return unhurt and undamaged.

The tale appeared in a book of French-Canadian folktales called &quot;Legends of French Canada&quot; by Edward C. Woodley, published in 1931, republished in 1938. The tale is told as a recollection of one of the men who made &quot;chasse-galerie&quot;. The men travel from St. Maurice to St. Jean. The return accident is credited to &quot;whiskey-blanc&quot;.

An earlier volume in English, entitled &quot;The Flying Canoe (La Chasse-Galerie)&quot; was written by J.E. LeRossignol, by McClelland &amp; Stewart Publishers in 1929. In it, thanks is given (with no further publication information) to &quot;the Toronto &quot;Star Weekly&quot;, and the &quot;Canadian Home Journal&quot; for their courteous permission to republish certain stories which appeared originally in these journals.&quot;

In 2015, a musical theatre version of the story was performed at the Storefront Theatre in Toronto. It won two Dora Awards and two Toronto Theatre Critics Awards. A larger production was mounted in 2016 by Soulpepper Theatre.

==In popular culture==
A Canadian 40¢ postage stamp was issued in 1991 (as the Witched Canoe), illustrating this legend (Canadian Scott #1334 or #1445), which forms part of a series on Canadian folktales.

One of the oldest rides at Montreal&#x27;s La Ronde amusement park, La Pitoune, uses this legend as inspiration. It is a basic sawmill log ride, but overhead is a representation of the flying canoe, with the devil perched behind the terrified men. The high bench at the back of the log-cars is therefore referred to as &quot;the devil-seat&quot;. It closed down during the 2016 season.

The legend serves as the label motif for Maudite, an ale produced by the Unibroue brewery of Quebec.

The science fiction author Gordon R. Dickson wrote a novelette titled &quot;The Immortal&quot; in 1965, which was later incorporated into the collection &quot;Mutants&quot; (1970). A French-Canadian spaceman, piloting a spaceship called &quot;la Chasse Gallerie&quot; (the misspelling is consistent through the story), is the victim of an attack by aliens that misfires, sending his ship hundreds of light-years away. He tries to return, but only the ship itself, devoid of any occupant, is then discovered and rescued by humans two centuries later. The novelette was later expanded into the novel &quot;The Forever Man&quot; (1986), by the same author.

The National Film Board of Canada produced a short animated film of &quot;The Legend of the Flying Canoe&quot; (&quot;La Chasse-galerie&quot;).

Claude Dubois sings a song called &quot;Chasse Galerie&quot; on the live album &quot;Rencontre de rêves&quot; (1992). Bruno Pelletier performed it in 2001 at the opening of the fourth Jeux de la Francophonie.

The Quebec folk band La Bottine Souriante recorded a song based on the legend, &quot;Martin de la Chasse-Galerie&quot;, for their album &quot;La Mistrine&quot; in 1994. In the song, Satan condemns the men in the flying canoe to wander in the skies over Montreal until the day of judgement.

Montreal folk metal band Blackguard use an image of the flying canoe on the cover of their 2009 album &quot;Profugus Mortis&quot;. Included on the album is a song called &quot;The Last We Wage&quot;. Its lyrics are based on this legend.

During the Opening Ceremony for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, a canoe containing fiddler Colin Maier was lowered from the ceiling in an allusion to the legend.

The Flying Canoe appears in Frédéric Back&#x27;s 1981 animated film &quot;Crac&quot;.

==Adaptations==

The radio program &quot;C&#x27;est la Vie&quot; retold the story on December 28, 2001, narrated by storyteller Marylyn Peringer.

The first feature film adaptation, &quot;Wild Run: The Legend (Chasse-Galerie: La Légende)&quot;, was released in February 2016. It was written by Guillaume Vigneault and directed by Jean-Philippe Duval.

A stage play written by Tyrone Savage, with music and lyrics by James Smith, was produced by the Soulpepper Theatre Company in Toronto in 2016.

<doc id="473466" wikidata="Q3651187" url="?curid=473466" title="Fast user switching">
<text>Fast user switching is a feature of a multi-user operating system which allows users to switch between user accounts without quitting applications and logging out.

== In Linux ==

The Linux kernel&#x27;s VT subsystem dates back to 1993 and does not understand the concept of multiple &quot;seats&quot;, meaning that of up to 63 VTs, only one VT can be active at any given time. Despite this kernel limitation, multi-seat is supported on Linux. The feature of &quot;fast user switching&quot; has less severe necessities than multi-seat does because the multiple users are not working simultaneously.

The most straight forward solution to elegant multi-seat are kmscon/systemd-consoled in combination with systemd-logind. The available desktop environments such as GNOME or KDE Software Compilation adapt their graphical login and session manager (e.g. GDM, SDDM, LightDM, etc.) to the underneath solution and have to be configured to implement fast user switching that way.

For installations with older environments, the functionality must be enabled in the appropriate configuration files then a hot key sequence such as codice_1 is pressed. A separate login window will now appear and the second user can log in (or even the first user again). Alternatively, in the default install, new X sessions can be started at will by using different &quot;display&quot; parameters to have them run in different virtual terminals (e.g. &quot;codice_2&quot; or &quot;codice_3&quot;). Again, hot key sequences allow the user switching to take place. 

Fast user switching may potentially introduce various security-related complications, and is handled differently among operating systems, each having its advantages and disadvantages. One possibility, simple and secure, is that only the first user gets ownership of resources. A second option is to grant ownership of resources to each new user. The last one to log in takes ownership. A third is to allow all users access to shared resources. This is easier and more intuitive, but allows (for example) one user to record another user&#x27;s conversation. In Windows, shared resources, such as sound, are available to all sessions. In Red Hat Linux, the default behavior is to give ownership of &quot;console resources&quot; to the first connected session, but it can share resources among groups of console users or be configured to manage console ownership differently.

== In macOS ==

Fast user switching was introduced in 2003 with Mac OS X Panther.

== In Microsoft Windows ==

Fast user switching in Windows is based on Remote Desktop Services technology. In Windows XP, GINA which is a component of Winlogon, and with which fast user switching interacts, can be programmatically called to automate a fast user switch. A PowerToy known as &quot;Super fast user switcher&quot; was offered in 2002 by Microsoft. It allowed fast user switching using a keyboard hotkey (Win+Q) (similar to Alt-Tab) without even going to the &quot;Welcome screen&quot;. It was later made unavailable when the original set of PowerToys was replaced by updated versions, but still works with Windows XP SP3 (32-bit) when running as administrator.

In Windows Vista, GINA is replaced by &quot;Credential Providers&quot;; however, they do not support programmatic initiation of fast user switching.

In Windows XP, fast user switching was unavailable if the computer is on a Windows Server domain network or if Offline Files was enabled. Windows Vista and later no longer have these restrictions. Fast user switching is also not available on Windows XP if SerialKeys (an accessibility option that allows users to use speech augmentation devices) or Client Services for NetWare are installed.

<text>Alice Jeanette Herz (née Strauß, alternatively rendered Strauss; May 25, 1882 – March 26, 1965) was a German feminist, anti-fascist and peace activist. She was the first person in the United States known to have immolated herself in protest of the escalating Vietnam War, following the example of Buddhist monk Thích Quảng Đức who immolated himself in protest of the oppression of Buddhists under the South Vietnamese government of Catholic President Ngo Dinh Diem.

==Early life==
Alice Jeanette Strauß was the first child of Rosalie Kramer (1858–1943) and Moritz Strauß (1850–1920), both of German-Jewish descent. She had six siblings, five younger sisters and a younger brother, who died at the age of two. She finished intermediate education and studied to become a teacher, but an eye disorder prevented Herz from completing her seminars and she instead found work as a secretary for a lawyer&#x27;s office. In 1907, Herz converted from Judaism to Protestantism.

== Activism in Germany ==
During the early 1900s, Herz joined the feminist movement and became an advocate for women&#x27;s rights, particularly for universal suffrage and cohabitation. She married Paul Herz, a chemist and the brother of Margarete Herz, a prominent suffragette. The couple moved to Güstrow in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and had two children, Helga (1912–2010) and Konrad (1915–1929). Konrad was born physically weak and was nearly blind.

Shortly after the beginning of World War I, her husband was drafted into the military, with Herz expecting German victory and Paul&#x27;s return within months. In 1918, with no end of the war in sight, Herz began openly supporting the democratisation of Germany with fellow pro-democracy activists and feminists, who sought the implementation of the vote for women. The movement tried to appeal to state minister Hans Sivkovich for &quot;the right to vote by universal, equal, secret and direct suffrage&quot; and with the end of World War I in November that same year, voting rights were realised with the founding of the Weimar Republic. In 1919, the Herz family moved to Berlin-Mahlsdorf, where Paul secured a position at a rubber factory. Possibly as a result of the regular exposure to harzardous chemicals, Paul died of kidney failure on December 30, 1928, aged 45. Their son Konrad passed away only weeks later from health complications.

On March 13, 1933, Herz and her daughter Helga left Germany for Switzerland, something she had considered for the past few years due to concerns with rising antisemitism and the growing political power of right-wing parties in the Weimar Republic. She solidified her decision with the appointment of Adolf Hitler as Reich Chancellor. Herz had correctly predicted that Jews and political opponents, especially left-wing, would come under heavy scrutiny, particularly after the Reichstag fire. Alice and Helga then moved to France, where Alice learned French and Esperanto. Both Herz women continued to engage in political activism through their involvement in the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom, with Alice criticising Nazism in papers she supplied to publications of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. Upon its forceful dissolution by the Nazi government in the summer of 1933, she became a writer for the Swiss Christian socialist magazine &quot;Neue Wege&quot;.

Following the Invasion of France, Herz and her daughter spent time at Gurs internment camp near the Spanish border, Alice and Helga eventually came to the United States in 1942.

== Life in the United States and anti-war effort ==
Alice and Helga settled in Detroit, Michigan, where Helga became a librarian at the Detroit Public Library, and Alice worked for some time as an adjunct instructor of German at Wayne State University. The pair petitioned for, but were denied, U.S. citizenship due to their refusal to vow to defend the nation by arms. Helga later reapplied and was granted citizenship in 1954, but it is not clear if Alice ever did so. Alice and Helga joined the Unitarians, and both became involved in the activities of several peace groups.

Herz wrote an open letter, which she distributed to several friends and fellow activists before her death. In her letter, she accused President Lyndon B. Johnson of using his military power &quot;to wipe out whole countries of his choosing&quot;. She appealed to the American people to &quot;awake and take action&quot; against war, and explained her self-immolation as an attempt &quot;to make myself heard&quot;.

==Self-immolation==
Herz set fire to herself on a street in Detroit on March 16, 1965, at the age of 82. A motorist and his two sons were driving by and saw her burning and put out the flames. She died of her injuries ten days later. According to Taylor Branch&#x27;s &quot;At Canaan&#x27;s Edge&quot; (2006), it was President Johnson&#x27;s address to Congress in support of a Voting Rights Act that led her to believe the moment was propitious to protest the Vietnam War.

==Legacy ==
Confiding to a friend before her death, Herz remarked that she had used all of the accepted protest methods available to activists—including marching, protesting, and writing countless articles and letters—and she wondered what else she could do. Japanese author and philosopher Shingo Shibata established the Alice Herz Peace Fund shortly after her death. A square in Berlin (Alice-Herz-Platz de]) was named in her honor in 2003.

<text>Asbury University is a private Christian university in Wilmore, Kentucky. Although it is a non-denominational school, the college is aligned with the Wesleyan-Holiness movement and is a member of the Wesleyan Holiness Connection. The school offers 50-plus majors across 17 departments. In the fall of 2016, Asbury University had a total enrollment of 1,854: 1,640 traditional undergraduate students and 214 graduate students. The campus of Asbury Theological Seminary, which became a separate institution in 1922, is located across the street from Asbury University.

==History==


Asbury College was established on September 2, 1890, by John Wesley Hughes in Wilmore, Kentucky. It was originally called Kentucky Holiness College, but the following year was renamed after Bishop Francis Asbury, a circuit-riding evangelist known as the &quot;Father of American Methodism&quot;. Bishop Asbury had established the first Methodist school in the United States west of the Appalachians, Bethel Academy, in 1790; its site lies near High Bridge, only about four miles (6 km) south of Wilmore.

After being pushed out as President of Asbury College in 1905, Hughes went on to found another college, Kingswood College, in Breckinridge County, Kentucky. Kingswood College no longer exists. Despite his disappointment over being removed at Asbury, Hughes wrote in his 1923 autobiography: &quot;Being sure I was led of God to establish (Asbury College), it being my college child born in poverty, mental perplexity, and soul agony, I loved it from its birth better than my own life. As the days have come and gone, with many sad and broken-hearted experiences, my love has increased. My appreciation of what it has done, what it is doing, and what it promises to do in the future, is such that I am willing to lay down my life for its perpetuation.&quot; In 1928, Hughes was invited to break ground for Asbury College&#x27;s new chapel, Hughes Auditorium, which is still in use today.

In 2001 The Kinlaw Library was completed. It was named in honor of Dennis F. Kinlaw and his wife Elsie. It contains over 150,000 items in several collections. There are three floors and most of the collections are on the main and top floors.

The college&#x27;s immediate past president, Sandra C. Gray, was inaugurated as the seventeenth president of Asbury on October 5, 2007. She was the institution&#x27;s first female president.

On March 5, 2010, Asbury College became Asbury University. The current president is Kevin Brown, a former faculty member of the university&#x27;s Dayton School of Business. He was inaugurated as the eighteenth president on March 6, 2020.

<doc id="473482" wikidata="Q165614" url="?curid=473482" title="Baden, Lower Saxony">
<text>Baden is a human settlement near Bremen, in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is known to Africanists and Phoneticians as the place where Diedrich Hermann Westermann was born and died. It is a borough of the town of Achim in Verden district.

Baden is on the train line from Hanover to Verden an der Aller to Bremen. 

Baden&#x27;s 1000th anniversary was celebrated in 2013. 

==Badener Mountains==
The Badener Mountains are located in Baden. The location is shaped by the Weser-Marsh to the west, and the collection of sand dunes of up to 40m high and the Badener-Moorland to the east. Until the 19th Century the area was only sparsely settled; the people lived by cultivating potatoes, breeding sheep, and working at the outlying factories in Bremen.
Hans Höppner observed about 200 of the 250 types of bees in Germany in Badener Mountains from 1898 until 1900.

==Oil Camp==
The Badener Oil Camp has been part of a bunker from World War I. It was erected in 1917 by Jürgen Daybridge. It served as a shipping station for raw oil, heating oil, and fuel. It was put into 14 subterranean containers; the last containers have been scrapped, however. During the Weimar Republic, the oil camp was rented to an oil company. As part of the re-militarization of Germany in preparation for the second World War, the oil camp was built up and extended (to 36 containers). Although the camp got through the war intact, it was blown up by English occupying troops in 1946.
The Area remained in military use, and was made into a military practice ground for the German Federal Armed Forces in 1956, housing the Steuben-Kaserne/ Steuben-barracks, named after Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben as well as the local practice area. It used to be home to the 11th Flugabwehrregiment (AAA-Regiment 11) until the area was disbanded completely in 2003.

<doc id="473487" wikidata="Q1047074" url="?curid=473487" title="Service pack">
<text>In computing, a service pack comprises a collection of updates, fixes, or enhancements to a software program delivered in the form of a single installable package. Companies often release a service pack when the number of individual patches to a given program reaches a certain (arbitrary) limit, or the software release has shown to be stabilized with a limited number of remaining issues based on users&#x27; feedback and bug reports. In large software applications such as office suites, operating systems, database software, or network management, it is not uncommon to have a service pack issued within the first year or two of a product&#x27;s release. Installing a service pack is easier and less error-prone than installing many individual patches, even more so when updating multiple computers over a network, where service packs are common. 

Service packs are usually numbered, and thus shortly referred to as SP1, SP2, SP3 etc. They may also bring, besides bug fixes, entirely new features, as is the case of SP2 of Windows XP (e.g. Windows Security Center), or SP3 and SP4 of the heavily database dependent &quot;Trainz 2009: World Builder Edition&quot;.

==Incremental and cumulative SPs==

Service Packs for Microsoft Windows were cumulative through Windows XP. This means that the problems that are fixed in a service pack are also fixed in later service packs. For example, Windows XP SP3 contains all the fixes that are included in Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2). Windows Vista SP2 was not cumulative, however, but incremental, requiring that SP1 be installed first.

Office XP, Office 2003, Office 2007, Office 2010 and Office 2013 service packs have been cumulative.

==Impact on installation of additional software components==
Application service packs replace existing files with updated versions that typically fix bugs or close security holes. If, at a later time, additional components are added to the software using the original media, there is a risk of accidentally mixing older and updated components. Depending on the operating system and deployment methods, it may then be necessary to manually reinstall the service pack after each such change to the software. This was, for example, necessary for Windows NT service packs; however, from Windows 2000 onwards, Microsoft redirected setup programs to use updated service pack files instead of files from the original installation media in order to prevent manual reinstall.

<text>Caldecote is a village and civil parish in Cambridgeshire, in the district of South Cambridgeshire, England. It lies south of the A428, approximately six miles west of Cambridge and three miles east of Cambourne.

==History==
The older part of the village lies to the south, just off the B1046 road and is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. Its origins have been speculated to have been as a hamlet of neighbouring Bourn, of which it was part of the same parish of in the 12th century. The parish church, St. Michael and All Angels, parts of which date to the 14th century, is in this part of the village. Bourn Brook and the route of the former Oxford and Cambridge Railway run to the south of the village.

==Highfields Caldecote==
Highfields Caldecote is a newer development in the north of the village. The A428 was converted to a dual carriageway and was opened in 2007, allowing easier access.
