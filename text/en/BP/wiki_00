<text>Loyola University New Orleans is a private Jesuit university in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. Originally established as Loyola College in 1904, the institution was chartered as a university in 1912. It bears the name of the Jesuit founder, Saint Ignatius of Loyola, and is a member of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities.

==History==

===Founding===

In the early 18th century Jesuits first arrived among the earliest settlers in New Orleans and Louisiana.

Loyola University in New Orleans was founded by the Society of Jesus in 1904 as Loyola College on a section of the Foucher Plantation bought by the Jesuits in 1886. A young Jesuit, Fr. Albert Biever, was given a nickel for street car fare and told by his Jesuit superiors to travel Uptown on the St. Charles Streetcar and found a university. As with many Jesuit schools, it contained both a college and preparatory academy. The first classes of Loyola College were held in a residence behind Most Holy Name of Jesus Church. Fr. Biever was the first president. The first of Loyola&#x27;s permanent buildings was undertaken in 1907, with Marquette Hall completed in 1910.

In 1911, the Jesuit schools in New Orleans were reorganized. The College of the Immaculate Conception, founded in 1847 in downtown New Orleans, split its high school and college divisions and became solely a secondary institution, now known as Jesuit High School. Loyola was designated as the collegiate institution and was chartered as Loyola University on July 10, 1912.

===Growth===

Loyola grew steadily over the years on its uptown campus. By the end of its first decade, the university not only included the College of Arts and Sciences, but also a School of Law (1914), a School of Dentistry (1914), and a College of Pharmacy (1919).

Several years later, a School of Music was added to the growing curriculum. At the time, the university&#x27;s campus consisted mainly of Marquette and Bobet Halls, with large athletic fields extending back towards the end of the campus at Freret St. Loyola has the distinction of transmitting the first radio broadcast in the Deep South, when WWL began operation as a laboratory experiment on March 31, 1922.

With the discontinuance of the football program in the 1930s, more space became available for construction of new facilities. Stallings Hall, built for the College Of Business Administration, and the Memorial Library (now known as the &quot;Old Library&quot;) were constructed in the post World War II years, accommodating the growth of the student population.

Norman Francis entered the Law School in 1952, becoming the first African-American admitted to the university.

More expansion continued in 1964, with the addition of the Joseph A. Danna Student Center; Albert Biever Hall, a student residence hall named after the first university president; and a central heating/cooling plant. Built soon after in 1967 was Henrietta Buddig Hall, a student residence that is Loyola&#x27;s tallest building at twelve stories. The last building to be added in the 1960s was the J. Edgar Monroe Science Building (now known as Monroe Hall), the largest academic building erected to date.

The College of Pharmacy closed in 1965. The School of Dentistry closed in 1971.

During the 1970s, Loyola began to make many changes, especially regarding Jesuit governance and in the academic curriculum, reflective of many universities during the same period. Reflecting the precedent for reform established by Vatican II, governance of the university shifted from a Jesuit regulated Board of Regents to a combined lay and clerical board of trustees. During this period, the Common Curriculum was developed to give students a wide breadth of knowledge in certain core areas, including Science, Math, History, and English studies. A broader trend was seen in the growth of the university during this period, seeing it gradually transform from a regional, largely commuter college to a higher national profile school that attracted students from across the United States.

In 1984 Loyola purchased the facilities of St. Mary&#x27;s Dominican College, a nearby Catholic women&#x27;s college which was closing down, and transformed it into the Broadway campus (after the name of its street location). Today, the Broadway campus includes Loyola&#x27;s School of Law, Cabra Residence Hall, and a Department of Visual Arts.

Expansion in recent years has seen the addition of Mercy Hall, purchased in 1993, a former girl&#x27;s preparatory academy; construction of Carrollton Hall, an upperclassman residence; and the J. Edgar and Louise S. Monroe Library, the latter two completed in 1999.

In 1996, the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities granted exclusive branding rights to Loyola University Chicago to call itself &quot;Loyola University&quot;. This resulted in Loyola New Orleans&#x27; current trademark, &quot;Loyola University New Orleans&quot;.

===Hurricane Katrina and aftermath===
In August 2005, Loyola closed its campus and evacuated its students in anticipation of Hurricane Katrina. The campus sustained minimal wind damage including broken windows but floodwaters did not breach any buildings. Due to the devastation of the city of New Orleans, Loyola canceled classes for the fall 2005 semester. Following cleanup, classes resumed with the start of the spring 2006 semester on Monday, January 9, 2006. Despite the displacement of the entire student body during the fall 2005 semester, 91 percent of Loyola&#x27;s undergraduate students returned for the spring 2006 semester. Loyola held commencement ceremonies for the Class of 2006 on April 28–29, becoming the first New Orleans college to do so post-Katrina.

On April 10, 2006, President Kevin Wm. Wildes, S.J., unveiled &quot;Pathways - Toward Our Second Century&quot;, Loyola&#x27;s strategic post-Katrina plan. The plan restructured the university&#x27;s colleges and eliminated several academic programs and faculty positions to reduce operating costs and revitalize the university. The board of trustees unanimously approved and passed the plan on May 19, 2006. In response, the faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences produced a vote of no-confidence in both President Wildes and Provost Walter Harris. In fall 2006, Loyola welcomed the class of 2010, the first post-Katrina freshman class, with 555 new students. Since the storm, Loyola has completed all physical repairs that were caused by the hurricane; and its enrollment is on a steady rise to pre-Katrina numbers.

The student-run online news service, &quot;Pack News,&quot; was established in 2012. Pack News marks the return of video-based journalism since the broadcast program was eliminated in 2007 with the university-wide Pathways elimination program after Hurricane Katrina.

Local chapters of the Alpha Delta Gamma fraternity, which opened in 1932, and the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, which opened in 1983, were closed during 2012. In 2018, President Wildes announced his intention to resign as president of the university. He was succeeded by Tania Tetlow on May 2, 2018.

In 2018, after years of financial problems, the school was placed on probation by its accreditor, Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges.

There have been seventeen presidents since the establishment of Loyola College in 1904, including Michael F. Kennelly, S.J. (1970–1974), William J. Byron, S.J. (2003-2004 (acting)), and Kevin Wm. Wildes, S.J. (2004–2018).
===University seal===
The seal, which was adopted by the university in 1929, features the coat of arms of the house of Loyola with the emblem of the Society of Jesus at the top. Central to the seal are two wolves and a golden pot, which come from St. Ignatius Loyola&#x27;s family crest and symbolize generosity (having enough to give to the wolves.) Above the figures of the wolves appears the fleur-de-lis, which represents the French origin of New Orleans and Louisiana. Beneath it is a pelican feeding its young with her own blood; this ancient symbol of Christianity (Christ feeding the Church with his body and blood through the Eucharist) depicts Loyola as an institution of the state of Louisiana.

==Academics==

The university enrolls 5,000 students, including 3,000 undergraduates. The student to faculty ratio is 11 to 1. The Princeton Review features Loyola New Orleans in the 2010 edition of its annual book, &quot;The Best 371 Colleges.&quot; Loyola University New Orleans ranks 10th of the South regional universities in 2017 U.S. News &amp; World Report Best College Ranking. The New York-based education services company says Loyola New Orleans offers students an outstanding undergraduate education.

Nearly all classes are taught by full-time faculty, 91 percent of whom hold doctoral or equivalent degrees in their areas of expertise. Loyola professors have been recognized nationally and internationally by the Pulitzer Committee, the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and by numerous other associations.

===Colleges===
Loyola is organized into colleges specializing in the liberal arts, social and physical sciences and certain professions. The colleges at Loyola include:
*College of Arts and Sciences
*The Joseph A. Butt, S.J., College of Business
*College of Music and Fine Arts
*College of Law
*College of Nursing and Health

====College of Arts and Sciences====
The College of Arts and Sciences focuses on areas concerning the natural sciences, social sciences, and liberal arts programs. It encompasses adult programs of study, including certificate and professional development programs, as well as the departments of biological sciences, chemistry and biochemistry, classical studies, criminology and justice, economics, English, environment, food studies, history, interdisciplinary programs, languages and cultures, mass communication, mathematics and computer science, philosophy, physics, political science, psychological sciences, religious studies, sociology, and teacher education programs. Students have been awarded British Marshall, Fulbright, Goldwater, Mellon, Mitchell, and Rhodes scholarships and have been included as USA Today&#x27;s top students. The college&#x27;s School of Mass Communication houses programs in public relations, journalism, and advertising. This includes the Loyola Bateman team, which won the 1997, 2000, 2003, 2005, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, and 2015 national competitions sponsored by the Public Relations Student Society of America.

====Joseph A. Butt, S.J., College of Business====
The College of Business began as an outgrowth of the College of Arts and Sciences and became a full-fledged college in 1947. In 1983, the College of Business was renamed in honor of Joseph A. Butt, S.J., a longtime Jesuit professor in the business college. The College of Business is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), a prestigious honor awarded to only 450 business schools worldwide. The college offers programs in the fields of accounting, business analytics, economics, finance, international business, management, and marketing.

====College of Music and Fine Arts====
The College of Music was established when the New Orleans Conservatory of Music and Dramatic Art, which was founded by Ernest Schuyten in 1919, was incorporated into the university in 1932. The College of Music gives students the chance to combine liberal arts with professional music courses. It is the only Jesuit college of music in the United States. The college offers programs in Jazz Studies, Music Education, Music Therapy, Music Industry Studies, Instrumental Performance, Vocal Performance, Ballet, Theatre Arts, and Visual Arts. In April 2007, the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz Performance announced its relocation to the College of Music and Fine Arts from the campus of the University of Southern California. The Music Industry program was one of the first in the country, and combines both the performing and technical aspects of the music business.

====College of Law====

Loyola&#x27;s law school opened in 1914. Co-located for many years on the main campus of Loyola, the Law School moved to the new Broadway campus in 1986, after Loyola purchased the closed campus of St. Mary&#x27;s Dominican College in 1984.

====College of Nursing and Health====
The College of Nursing and Health is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE). It also includes the Loyola Institute for Ministry.

===Centers and institutes===
The university houses institutes in many different disciplines:
*Twomey Center for Peace Through Justice
*Jesuit Social Research Institute (JSRI)
*Center for Environmental Communications
*Center for the Study of Catholics in the South
*Gillis Long Poverty Law Center
*Jesuit Center
*Lindy Boggs National Center for Community Literacy
*Loyola Institute of Politics
*Loyola Institute for Ministry (LIM)
*Shawn M. Donnelley Center for Nonprofit Communications

====Jesuit Social Research Institute==== 
&quot;Jesuit Social Research Institute&quot; (JSRI) is a joint effort of Loyola University New Orleans and the Society of Jesus Central and Southern Province, originating in 2007. Its main efforts are in the areas of research, policy analysis, and advocacy for justice, especially with regard to poverty, immigration, and racism issues.

The Institute publishes &quot;JustSouth Quarterly&quot; and &quot;JustSouth E-newsletter&quot;, and employs the various means of publication on and off the web along with presentations at conferences and before legislative bodies. It also makes presentations in schools and parishes. It is active in advocacy on issues pertaining to its core expertise, as can be gathered from the following.

In May 2016 JSRI published the &quot;JustSouth Index&quot; which provides a comparison of how each of the states Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida are doing on critical indices of economic and social welfare as compared to the 50 states.

==Campus==

Loyola is located in the historic Audubon Park District on St. Charles Avenue. Its original campus, now called the Main Campus, was founded on a tract of land purchased by the New Orleans Jesuits in 1889. The purchased portion of land was much larger than the current day campus; in fact, the original land purchase contained the land now occupied by both Loyola and Tulane universities and Audubon Place. Through the next twenty years, portions of the original land purchase were sold to different entities to raise money for the new university, resulting in the current Main Campus area of 19 acres.

By the 1950s, most of the original campus had been developed and the university looked around for areas where it could expand. In the 1960s, J. Edgar Monroe, a major benefactor of the university, donated to Loyola a large undeveloped tract of land in Metairie where the university could either expand or move its entire location. After reviewing its options, including the sale of the original campus to Tulane University, the university decided to remain on St. Charles Avenue, subsequently selling off its property in Metairie in ten years as a condition of the donation.

The Louis J. Roussel Jr., Performance Hall on the Loyola campus, which stages symphony concerts, is named for the late New Orleans businessman Louis J. Roussel Jr.

The closure of St. Mary&#x27;s Dominican College in 1984 provided an opportunity for Loyola to expand its campus. After renovation of the closed college and some new construction, the Broadway Campus was opened in 1986, with several university offices and programs, the school of law most significantly, moving to the new campus.

===Main campus===
Loyola&#x27;s first campus, the Main Campus is located on St. Charles Avenue across from Audubon Park and adjacent to Tulane University, which also fronts St. Charles. The St. Charles Streetcar passes in front of the main campus. According to The Princeton Review Loyola students get along well with members of the local community. It is ranked #11 out of 371 Best Colleges for Great Town-Gown Relations.

The Main Campus contains the majority of the undergraduate academic divisions on campus, as well as serves as the hub of campus activities. Fronting St. Charles is Marquette Hall, the oldest campus building, which serves as the iconic image of the university. Several quadrangles organize the campus proceeding from the front of campus to its northern border at Freret Street, including the Academic quad, the Plaza De Los Martires De La Paz, or Peace Quad, named after the Salvadoran martyrs of 1989, and the Residential Quad. Other notable buildings include the Joseph Danna Student Center, J. Edgar and Louise S. Monroe Library, Bobet Hall, J. Edgar Monroe Hall, the Music and Communications Building, and Branch Knox Miller Hall.

====Marquette Hall====
Named after the Jesuit explorer Fr. Jacques Marquette, S.J., Marquette Hall is one of the most prominent buildings on campus. Begun in 1907, it was finished in 1910. After its completion, most of the classes of the college and later, the university were conducted in the building until the construction of Bobet Hall in the late 1920s. The university&#x27;s first library, the Bobet Library, was located on the third floor of Marquette Hall until the Memorial Library was constructed in the 1950s. When the dentistry school began its operations, the fourth floor of Marquette was used partly as a cadaver dissection area, and an external winch was used to hoist the cadavers up the four floors. Today, Marquette primarily functions as an administrative building, but some classes are still conducted there. Also, the main theatre used by the Theatre Arts program is housed on the third floor of the building.

====J. Edgar and Louise S. Monroe Library====

The J. Edgar and Louise S. Monroe library is the main university library, constructed in 1999, replacing the Memorial Library built in 1950. The library includes 377,000 books and periodicals and online access to 36,000 journals and 27,000 e-books. Its music collection includes over 20,000 scores and recordings, and the special collections and archives include material concerning the history of Louisiana and the South, the Society of Jesus, and Loyola University New Orleans. The library has won numerous awards in its existence, including the Association of College &amp; Research Libraries&#x27; 2003 &quot;Excellence in Academic Libraries Award and the 2004 H.W. Wilson Award for Professional Development. More so, the library ranks 5th in the &quot;Best College Library&quot; category of The Princeton Review&#x27;s 2010 edition of &quot;The Best 361 Colleges&quot;.

====Weekend uses of campus====
In previous years the Japanese Weekend School of New Orleans (ニューオリンズ日本語補習校 &quot;Nyū Orinzu Nihongo Hoshūkō&quot;), a Weekend Japanese school program, held its classes at Loyola University&#x27;s main campus. Kindergarten and elementary school students used Monroe Hall and Junior high school students used Marquette Hall.

===Broadway campus===

The former campus of St. Mary&#x27;s Dominican College, the site was purchased by Loyola in 1984. Broadway Street forms its downtown border, and fronts St. Charles Avenue. The campus is located in the Greenville neighborhood, a former plantation and town annexed by New Orleans in the 19th Century. Greenville Hall, a Registered Historic Place built in 1889, forms the focus of the small campus, along with the College of Law building.

====Law Library====
Loyola University New Orleans&#x27; Law Library is located in the College of Law building on the Broadway Campus. It contains over 286,000 volumes and microfilm for the support of the students and faculty of the College of Law. Due to the unique tradition of civil law in Louisiana, the library has substantial collections from civil law jurisdictions from around the world, including France, Scotland, and Quebec.

===Sustainability===
Loyola&#x27;s Statement on Environmental Responsibility details the ways in which campus operations strives to maintain its facilities in an environmentally sound and sustainable manner. Currently, 75% of all university classrooms are equipped with motion sensor lights and irrigation systems are designed with rain sensors to conserve water, both efforts supporting energy efficiency. The Loyola recycling program includes office paper, aluminum cans, and newspaper.

The student-run group Loyola University Community Action Program organizes the Environmental Action Program, which works to educate &amp; advocate for environmental justice on campus and in the Gulf Coast region. The Student Government Association maintains a Sustainability Garden to provide the campus community with gardening space and supplies as well as sustainability information.

==Student life==

===Danna Student Center===
The epicenter of Loyola&#x27;s on-campus life is the Dr. Joseph A. Danna Center, built in 1964. The Danna Student Center houses many services, including the campus bookstore, lounges, and student organization and university offices, and all of the university&#x27;s dining services. Loyola&#x27;s main cafeteria, the Orleans Room (colloquially known as the &quot;O.R.&quot;) is also housed in the building. In 2008, the university completed a US$3 million renovation of the Danna Student Center under the guidance of Henry R. Muñoz III, improving the organization and services of the building.

===Student housing===
The university requires all students from outside the metropolitan New Orleans area to live on campus their first two years. Housing options include four on-campus residence halls for students: Biever Hall, Buddig Hall, Carrollton Hall, and Cabra Hall. Biever and Buddig hall are primarily reserved for freshmen and underclassmen male and female students, respectively. Carrollton and Cabra Halls are for upperclassmen students, offering suite and apartment-style living. The Department of Residential Life manages the Residence Halls, and provides programming aimed at building community within the residence halls. The Residence Hall Association, made up of residential students, serves as a representative for students to the administration and also allocates funding to student-run projects and activities.

===University Honors Suite===
The Honors suite is located on the first floor of the J. Edgar and Louise S. Monroe Library and includes the &quot;Castle,&quot; where its conference table is available for meetings, Quiz Bowl practice and homework; and the &quot;Tower&quot; lounge, designed for study, discussion and the occasional nap. Both areas afford free access to the Honors printer, and are available to Honors students during all library hours. The University Honors program has doubled in size under the directorship of Dr. Naomi Yavneh Klos, who is currently the president of the National Collegiate Honors Council and chair of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities Honors Consortium.

===University Sports Complex===
The University Sports Complex, formerly called the Recreational Sports Complex or Rec Plex, houses all the athletic facilities on Loyola&#x27;s campus. It was constructed in 1987 and paid for in full by Freeport-McMoRan. The complex is situated on the fifth and sixth floors of the Freret Street parking garage.

The Complex features a jogging track; indoor tennis, racquetball, and basketball courts; weight rooms; and a swimming pool.

===Organizations===
The student body of Loyola is governed by a Student Government Association (SGA).

The Loyola University Community Action Program (LUCAP) was founded in 1975 by a student group led by Loyola students Robert Guasco and Mary Baudouin as an organization connecting students with community service, social justice, and advocacy work in New Orleans and abroad. LUCAP is the largest student organization on campus, due largely to its inclusive membership of any current or former project volunteer. LUCAP partners with local non-profit organizations including Habitat for Humanity, Green Light New Orleans, and the Gulf Restoration Network to provide students with opportunities to serve in their community. LUCAP successfully organized against Freeport-McMoRan in 1995 after the company donated money to Loyola University New Orleans to found the Institute for Environmental Communications, build sports facilities, and support the Twomey Center for Peace Through Justice. The organization cited Freeport&#x27;s history of lack of regard for environmental quality and its history of human rights violations
in the developing world. LUCAP organized student protest led to Freeport requesting their donation be returned. Other organizations include Circle K International, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Peers Advocating Wellness (PAWS), and many others. Many students took a lead in rebuilding New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina through these service organizations.

Loyola is home to 15 social fraternities and sororities that encompass over 20 percent of the undergraduate population. Presently, none of the Greek organizations own official houses. Loyola&#x27;s Greek organizations are governed by three councils, the Interfraternity Council, the Panhellenic Association, and the National Pan-Hellenic Council.

===Campus publications and media===
The student-run weekly newspaper, &quot;The Maroon&quot;, was established in 1923. It is published weekly during the spring and fall semesters. &quot;The Maroon&quot; has been nominated for the Associated Collegiate Press&#x27; National Pacemaker Award 11 times and won the award in 1982, 1983, 1986, 1998, 1999, 2006, and 2015. In 2017 &quot;Maroon&quot; staff won seven awards in the Catholic Press Association national competition, including three firsts. &quot;The Maroon&quot; is part of Loyola Student Media, the university student-media organization that publishes and sells advertising for &quot;The Maroon&quot;, &quot;The Maroon Online&quot;, &quot;Wolf Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Pack News&quot;.

Additional student publications include &quot;Wolf Magazine&quot;, Loyola&#x27;s student-run magazine, which is part of Loyola Student Media. &quot;Wolf Magazine&quot; was once &quot;The Wolf&quot;, the annual yearbook. Other student publications include &quot;ReVisions&quot;, the annual literary arts journal, &quot;Hyster&quot;, the Women&#x27;s Issues Organization&#x27;s zine, and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Response&quot;, which publishes the single best paper from each of the English Department&#x27;s literature and theory courses. Each semester, a small group of students intern for the &quot;New Orleans Review&quot;, an international journal of contemporary poetry, fiction, nonfiction, art, photography, film and book reviews, founded in 1968.

Crescent City Radio, is the university&#x27;s internet radio station based in New Orleans as a freeform radio station. The station broadcasts a diverse offering of locally produced entertainment, music, and talk programs ranging from listener-requested music, local music talent, and radio formats such as urban contemporary, mainstream urban, adult contemporary, classical music, swamp pop, gospel, and Latin Top 40 Pop. The station is managed by the Music Industry Studies Program of the College of Music and Fine Arts at Loyola University New Orleans.

The student-run online news service, &quot;Pack News&quot;, posts weekly online video news and entertainment updates along with individual news reports, and commentary. Since 2013, &quot;Pack News&quot; has focused its weekly news updates to covering one specific topic in depth followed by political commentary. Topics have usually favored the political left and Democratic Party. &quot;Pack News&quot; is produced by the university&#x27;s Radio Television Digital News Association&#x27;s student chapter and is part of Loyola Student Media except in staff hiring.

==Athletics==
The Loyola athletic teams are called the Wolf Pack. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Southern States Athletic Conference (SSAC; formerly known as Georgia–Alabama–Carolina Conference (GACC) until after the 2003–04 school year) since the 2010–11 academic year. The Wolf Pack previously competed in the Gulf Coast Athletic Conference (GCAC) from 1995–96 to 2009–10.

Loyola competes in 18 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, swimming, tennis and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, swimming, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball; and co-ed sports with competitive cheer, competitive dance and eSports.

Loyola&#x27;s 16 intercollegiate teams are almost wholly funded through student activity fees per a student referendum passed in 1991. In 1972, Loyola suspended its athletics program, citing &quot;educational and financial&quot; reasons. However, in 1991, the athletics program was re-instituted, amid student appeals for its reinstatement, including the aforementioned referendum. Locally, Loyola&#x27;s biggest rival is the adjacent Tulane University, and the annual basketball game between the two teams is one of biggest athletic events at Loyola, called The Battle for Freret. Another rival in conference play is a fellow Jesuit university Spring Hill College. The Pack Pride Committee was founded in 2007 to promote athletics and to encourage community members to be &quot;Proud to be Part of the &#x27;Pack&#x27;&quot;.

==Notable faculty and alumni==

Many notable politicians, entertainers, and figures in United States history are alumni of the university. These include current and former members of the United States House of Representatives, members of the Louisiana House of Representatives and Louisiana State Senate, high ranking presidential United States Cabinet officials, a former head of state, federal and state judges, a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, former mayors, a restaurateur, news reporters, a former governor, actors, journalists, and numerous music celebrities, including G-Eazy and Harry Connick Jr. among others.

The university is also home to a number of high-profile professors, including Harry Shearer, a voice actor for &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

The University honours distinguished academics with &#x27;endowed professorships&#x27;. For example in 2000, five were recognised in this way: English Professor Katherine H. Adams, Music Professor Philip Frohnmayer, Business Professor Joseph Ganitsky, Music Professor David P. Swanzy, and English Professor Julian N. Wasserman. In 2023, a total of 40 academics had endowed chairs or professorships including Edmondo Lupieri and Miguel H. Diaz.

<text>Alvin Christian &quot;Al&quot; Kraenzlein (December 12, 1876 – January 6, 1928) was an American track-and-field athlete known as &quot;the father of the modern hurdling technique&quot;. He was the first sportsman in the history of the Olympic games to win four individual gold medals in a single discipline at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris. , Alvin Kraenzlein is the only track-and-field athlete who has won four individual titles at one Olympics. Kraenzlein is also known for developing a pioneering technique of straight-leg hurdling, which allowed him to set two world hurdle records. He is an Olympic Hall of Fame (1984) and National Track and Field Hall of Fame (1974) inductee.

==Early years==
Kraenzlein was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, a son of Johann Georg Kränzlein, a brewer, and Maria Augusta Schmidt, both of German origin. After his family moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he attended Milwaukee&#x27;s East Side High School, where he became involved in sports. In 1895, during the Wisconsin Interscholastic Championships, he won first places in the 100-yard dash, 120-yard high hurdles, 220-yard low hurdles, high jump, and shot put.

He attended the University of Wisconsin where he studied engineering. In 1896, he won the 220-yard low hurdles, the high jump and placed second in the 100-yard dash and shot put at the freshman-sophomore track-and-field meet. During the 1897 Intercollegiate Athletic Conference Championship, Kraenzlein won the 220-yard low hurdles and the high jump. He led the Wisconsin team to the team title. He also won the 1897 Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) title in the 220-yard low hurdles. In 1897, Kraenzlein set an indoor world record of 36.6 seconds in the 300-yard low hurdles.

In 1898, after being recruited by Mike Murphy, the University of Pennsylvania track-and-field coach, he moved to Philadelphia, where he studied at the Dental School, graduating in 1900.

After winning his first national athletics title in 1897 – the 220 yards hurdles race at the AAU championship, Kraenzlein won five AAU titles in hurdling and long jump events, and eight Intercollegiate Association of Amateur Athletes of America titles in dash, hurdling, and the long jump. Being a student at Philadelphia University, he established world records for the 120 meter high hurdles and the 220 meter low hurdles, the last standing for quarter of a century. In 1899, Kraenzlein established the long jump world record of 24&#x27; 3 1/2&quot;. He was a leader of the Penn track-and-field team that won four consecutive team IC4A titles.

Kraenzlein was noted for his hurdling technique, as he was among the first to practice the modern method of straight-lead-leg (the first leg over the hurdle remains straight and parallel with the ground) hurdle clearing. Arthur Croome from Great Britain first attempted the straight-lead-leg style in 1886, however, Kraenzlein perfected it and turned into a mainstream technique. This was a significant development, as it enabled athletes to overcome the hurdles without reducing speed.

==The world&#x27;s spotlight==

In 1900, Kraenzlein was training in England in preparation for the Paris Summer Olympics. He won the British Amateur Athletic Association Championships in London in the 120 yards hurdles and the long jump at the 1900 AAA Championships. before entering the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, where he established a world record in the 120 yards hurdles for grass tracks.

Kraenzlein became the most successful athlete of the 1900 Olympics. During three days of competitions there, he won four titles, establishing new Olympic record each time:
*60-meters sprint (7.0 seconds)
*110-meters high hurdles (15.4 seconds)
*200-meters low hurdles (25.4 seconds)
*Long jump (7.185 m (23&#x27; 6 3/4&quot;))

In the 60 meters, he ran both the preliminary and final in 7.0 seconds, defeating Walter Tewksbury by bare inches in the finals. In His victory in the long jump, Kraenzlein defeated silver medalist Meyer Prinstein, his great rival from Syracuse University, by a single centimeter. Prinstein&#x27;s mark had been set in the qualification, and he did not attend the final, because it was held on a Sunday. It was said the two had an informal agreement not to compete on Sunday, and when Prinstein learned that Kraenzlein did show up he became violent, allegedly punching Kraenzlein according to some accounts (others claim that Prinstein was restrained before he could land the punch).

==Coaching==
After the 1900 Olympic Games, Kraenzlein eased down from athletic competition in late 1900, as the owner of six world and four Olympic records. However, he did successfully defend his British AAA title over 120 yards hurdles at the 1901 AAA Championships.

He returned to Milwaukee and started a dental practice. He also became a manager of the Milwaukee Athletic Association. In 1902, having returned to Philadelphia, he married Claudine Gilman, whom he knew from his student days. He practiced dentistry in Philadelphia until 1906, when he became the track-and-field coach at Mercersburg Academy, a selective prep school in Pennsylvania. Among his students was Ralph Craig, a future Olympic titleholder in both the 100 and 200 meters in 1912 Olympic Games.

From 1910 to 1913 he was the head track-and-field and football coach (in 1910–1911) at the University of Michigan.

In 1913, he signed a five-year $50,000 contract with the German government to train the 1916 German Olympic track team (this was canceled because of the outbreak of World War I). With World War I coming, Kraenzlein served in the U.S. Army as a physical training specialist. When the war ended, he became an assistant coach for the University of Pennsylvania track team. He also coached at summer camps and at the Havana Golf and Tennis Club in Cuba in the winter.

In late 1927, he became affected by bouts of pleurisy. Kraenzlein died in early 1928 of endocarditis in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

<text>Boston Public is an American drama television series created by David E. Kelley and broadcast on Fox. Set in Boston, the series centers on Winslow High School, a fictional public high school in the Boston Public Schools district. It features a large ensemble cast and focuses on the work and private lives of the various teachers, students, and administrators at the school. It aired from October 2000 to January 2004. Its slogan was &quot;Every day is a fight. For respect. For dignity. For sanity.&quot;

==History==
&quot;Boston Public&quot; initially preceded &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; on Monday nights. However, Fox moved it to the Friday night death slot for its fourth season. Viewership declined as a result and it was canceled after the 13th episode aired on January 30, 2004. Production halted after the 15th episode was completed. The final two episodes aired on March 1 and 2, 2005, later in syndication on TV One. Neither episode wrapped up any character stories.

The title of each episode was a numbered chapter, similar to that in a high school textbook, and each character appeared in a given story arc, with the professional and personal lives often intersecting.

&quot;Boston Public&quot; was the winner of the 2002 Peabody Award (&quot;Chapter Thirty-Seven&quot;) from the Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Georgia.

==Cast and characters==


==Episodes==

&quot;Boston Public&quot; ran for four seasons, consisting of 81 episodes. Each season contained 22 episodes, except the fourth season which had 15 episodes due to cancellation.
===Crossover with &quot;The Practice&quot;===

In &quot;The Practice&quot; episode, &quot;The Day After&quot; (season 5, episode 14), Kevin Riley asks Ellenor Frutt to represent him in a school board meeting when he&#x27;s fired from Winslow High School, which takes place in the &quot;Boston Public&quot; episode &quot;Chapter Thirteen&quot; (season 1, episode 13). After &quot;Boston Public&quot; was canceled, Chi McBride reprised the role of Steven Harper on an episode of &quot;The Practice&quot; spin-off series &quot;Boston Legal&quot; in the episode &quot;Let Sales Ring&quot; (season 1, episode 16).

<doc id="465778" wikidata="Q16984593" url="?curid=465778" title="Holland Land Company">
<text>The Holland Land Company was an unincorporated syndicate of thirteen Dutch investors from Amsterdam, headquartered in Philadelphia, who purchased large tracts of American land for development and speculation. Their primary purchase was that of the western two-thirds of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase in 1792 and 1793, an area that afterward was known as the Holland Purchase. Additional lands were purchased in northwest Pennsylvania. Aliens were forbidden from owning land within New York State, except by special acts of the New York State Legislature, so investors placed their funds in the hands of certain trustees who bought the land in central and western New York State. The syndicate hoped to sell the land rapidly at a great profit. Instead, for many years they were forced to make further investments in their purchase; surveying it, building roads, digging canals, to make it more attractive to settlers. They influenced state policy in New York to allow foreign ownership of the land, avoid new taxes, and promote the construction of the Erie Canal and government roads on the company lands. They supported Governor Dewitt Clinton&#x27;s faction in the state government to achieve these goals. The company finished selling its New York lands in 1839 and its Pennsylvania lands in 1849, and the company was liquidated in 1858.

Company lawyer David A. Ogden purchased the pre-emption rights for the remaining Seneca reservation lands from the Holland Land Company in 1810 and established another unincorporated syndicate, the Ogden Land Company. The company purchased much of the Seneca lands in the 1820s and 1830s, often fraudulently.

== Land purchases ==

=== Early purchases ===
Dutch interest in American investments began during the American Revolution. In 1789, four Dutch firms, Pieter Stadnitski and Son, Nicolaas and Jacob Van Staphorst, P. &amp; C. Van Eeghen, and Ten Cate &amp; Vollenhoven, joined together and hired Theophile Cazenove as their purchasing agent to engage in land speculation. Cazenove&#x27;s office, and later the company headquarters, were based in Philadelphia. The four houses soon expanded to six when they were joined by Willem Willink and Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck in 1792, and established shares for the Holland Land Company in 1795. In 1791, Cazenove purchased north of the Mohawk River and in central New York, organized under the Cazenovia Establishment, on behalf of the four houses. In 1792, Cazenove arranged for the purchase of in northwestern Pennsylvania on behalf of the six houses.

In addition to land, the Dutch investors bought American funds, including the South Carolina Funded Debt and the Massachusetts Deposit, and shares in the Pennsylvania Population Company. On the advice of Cazenove, they also obtained shares in canal companies in the years 1791–1792, including the Patowmack Canal, James River and Kanawha Canal, Santee Canal, Western Canal and the Connecticut Canal.

=== The Holland Purchase ===
The tract purchased in Western New York was the portion of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase that lay west of the Genesee River. The aboriginal title to the land belonged to the Seneca people at the time. During the colonial area, New York and Massachusetts had both claimed pre-emption, the right to purchase the land from the Seneca, based on their colonial charters. In 1786, the two states negotiated an agreement in the Treaty of Hartford that would allow Massachusetts to retain the pre-emption right. Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham then purchased the pre-emption right from Massachusetts, but failed to extinguish the Indian title to this tract and defaulted on their purchase in 1790. Robert Morris next purchased the pre-emption right from Massachusetts in 1791 for $333,333.34 (about $ today). Morris was a signatory of the Declaration of Independence and a financier of the American Revolution, and at the time was the richest man in America. His purchase from Massachusetts was for some , divided into five parcels, which contained all lands west of the Genesee River except for the of the Mill Yard Tract, which Phelps and Gorham retained along with their other lands east of the Genesee. He was soon pressed by his own debts and sought another purchaser for the land. He kept one parcel of for himself in a tract wide and running the breadth of Western New York from Lake Ontario to the Pennsylvania, known as the Morris Reserve. The right for the remaining four parcels, comprising the westernmost was then purchased between December 1792 and July 1793 from Morris by the Dutch investors comprising the syndicate, through Cazenove and trustee Herman LeRoy.

=== Treaty of Big Tree ===

Before Morris could give the Holland Land Company title to this land, it was still necessary to extinguish the Indians&#x27; title to it. This was achieved at the 1797 Treaty of Big Tree, executed on the Genesee River near modern-day Geneseo, south of Rochester, New York. Representatives of the Holland Land Company, Robert Morris&#x27;s son Thomas, the Senecas, and a commissioner for the United States named Jeremiah Wadsworth gathered at Big Tree in August, 1797 and negotiations began. Mary Jemison attended as the leader of the Seneca, and proved to be an able negotiator. Chiefs and Sachems present included Red Jacket, Cornplanter, Governor Blacksnake, Farmer&#x27;s Brother and about 50 others. Red Jacket and Cornplanter spoke strongly against selling the land. They held out for reservations, lands which the Indians would keep for their own use. After much discussion, the Treaty of Big Tree was signed Sept. 15, 1797. The native Indians were to receive $100,000 (about $ today) for their rights to about 3.75 million acres (15,000 km2), and they reserved about 200,000 acres (809 km2) for themselves.

In 1802, the boundaries of the Cattaraugus Reservation were adjusted and a strip of Seneca lands along the Niagara River was acquired by the company.

In 1798, the New York Legislature, with the assistance of Aaron Burr, authorized aliens to hold land directly, and the trustees conveyed the Holland Purchase to the real owners. It was transferred to two sets of proprietors, and one of these sets soon divided into two, making three sets of owners altogether. Each set of proprietors owned their tract as &quot;joint tenants&quot; with right of survivorship, which means as proprietors died off, the surviving proprietors took the deceased&#x27;s share, and that share did not pass by will or inheritance, except in the case of the last survivor.

The first transfer by the trustees was all of the Holland Purchase except 300,000 acres (1,200 km2), which went to Wilhelm Willink, Nicolaas van Staphorst, Pieter van Eeghen, Hendrick Vollenhoven, and Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck. The 300,000 acre (1,200 km2) remainder was conveyed to Wilhelm Willink, Wilhelm Willink, Jr., Jan Willink and Jan Willink, Jr. About two years after the first transfers, the proprietors of the large tract reconveyed title to the original five, plus Wilhelm Willink, Jr., Jan Willink, Jr., Jan Gabriel van Staphorst, Roelof van Staphorst, Jr., Cornelius Vollenhoven, Hendrick Seye and Pieter Stadnitski. The members of the Holland Land Company never travelled to America.

=== Land surveys ===
In 1795, Joseph Ellicott was hired as the chief surveyor for the company. Beginning in 1798, he formed a surveying team including his brother Benjamin, Augustus Porter, and 130 men. Over the next three years they surveyed the Holland Tract at a total cost of US $70,921.69½ (about $ in today&#x27;s dollars). While surveying the boundaries of the Buffalo Creek Reservation, Porter bent the northwest corner of the reservation so that the Holland Land Company would own the land around the mouth of the creek where the village of Buffalo was to be built.

=== Company agents ===

In 1799, Paul Busti (Paolo Busti) succeeded Cazenove as General Agent. Busti was a native of Milan who had made his career in Amsterdam where he married Elizabeth May, a sister-in-law of one of the syndicate members, Isaac ten Cate. Other agents with Dutch roots included John Lincklaen, Gerrit Boon, Adam Gerard Mappa, and Mr. Busti&#x27;s assistants Harm Jan Huidekoper and John Jacob Vanderkemp. Vanderkemp succeeded Busti as Agent General after his death in 1824 and served until the liquidation of the Holland Land Companies assets in the 1840s. 

Ellicott was then the resident agent in charge of the Holland Tract land sales in 1800. After Ellicott&#x27;s resignation in 1821, the Holland Tract sales were overseen by Jacob S. Otto from 1821 to 1827, and David E. Evans from 1827 to 1837. David A. Ogden and his brother Thomas Ludlow Ogden were legal advisors to the company.

=== Company operations ===
The Holland Land Company opened a main land office in 1801 in Batavia, New York, which later became the county seat of Genesee County. A second office was opened in Danby, Vermont. Busti also appointed local agents at other offices within different parts of the area. They located subagents in Mayville in 1810, Ellicottville in 1818, Buffalo in 1826, Meadville, Instanter (a small village of German settlers in McKean County, Pennsylvania), two districts in Eastern Alleghany, Lancaster, Cazenovia, and Barneveld. From the very beginning the agents were urged to keep the records in stone fireproof safes or to deposit them with banks. 

The company struggled to sell its Pennsylvania lands, which were unsuitable for farming and today remain sparsely populated. The four houses similarly struggled to find buyers in the northern New York tracts, which were sold to Michael Hogan in 1806, and the Cazenovia Establishment, which was sold to John Lincklaen in 1818. 

After years of preparation, the first land sale in the Holland tract was made in 1804. Tension between the company and the residents of Western New York began almost immediately due to the structure of the land sales. The Dutch investors had instructed for land to be sold for $2.75 per acre with a down payment of one-quarter to one-third its value, but it soon became apparent to Ellicott and the other agents that these prices were unaffordable to nearly all of the arriving settlers, some of whom were entirely cashless. In the sparsely populated region, eviction was also difficult to carry out once land had been settled on. As a result, conditional sales were made ad hoc by the agents, involving discounted prices, lower down payments, longer mortgages, or labor from the settlers on the company&#x27;s behalf. Leniency earned the company goodwill with the settlers for many years. 

The company worked on several investments to local infrastructure to make the land more profitable and attractive, including roads, irrigation systems, canals, and mills. Free tracts of land were set aside for the construction of private roads, inns, churches, and other structures. In 1802, the company laid out the first street plan for the city of Buffalo. Ellicott recognized that the company lacked the resources to build and maintain roads, and so he lobbied the state legislature for the creation of Genesee County, which initially encompassed all of the Holland Purchase lands, so that it could assume control over local road construction. After succeeding, Ellicott ensured that all of the county&#x27;s officials would be favorable to the company. Most settlers believed that company and government services were still inadequate, and public campaigns were organized to levy a tax on nonresidents to support government improvements starting in the 1810s. The company lobbied for the construction of the Erie Canal to improve land values further, and Ellicott was appointed to the canal commission in 1816. The company donated 100,000 acres of land for the canal&#x27;s right of way. In the 1830s, after years of petitions from Western New Yorkers, the New York legislature passed a law taxing debts due to foreign landowners, targeted specifically at the company. The company responded by ending its lenient policies to increase profits. It also began selling its land deeds to local investors, who enforced collections and evictions even more strictly. Events came to a head in 1836 when the Mayville and Batavia offices were both attacked by mobs.

In 1839, the last land in Western New York was sold off to local investors and settlers, and the Batavia office was closed. Land sales in Pennsylvania were concluded in 1849, and in 1856, the Philadelphia headquarters closed. The company was formally dissolved in 1858.

The town of Holland, New York was named after the company.

== Ogden Land Company ==
David Ogden purchased the pre-emption right for the remaining Seneca reservation lands from the Holland Land Company in 1810, and transferred the right to a new syndicate called the Ogden Land Company in 1821, led by Robert Troup, Thomas Ludlow Ogden, and Benjamin W. Rogers. In 1826, the syndicate negotiated a treaty to purchase several reservation lands, including the Caneadea Reservation, Canawagus Reservation, Big Tree Reservation, Squawky Hill Reservation, and portions of the Gardean, Tonawanda, Cattaraugus, and Buffalo Creek Reservations, for $48,216. The treaty was never ratified by the Senate, and in 1896 the Seneca Nation unsuccessfully attempted to recover the land in &quot;Seneca Nation of Indians v. Christy.&quot; In 1838, after Ogden&#x27;s death, the company was party to the Second Treaty of Buffalo Creek for all of the remaining Iroquois lands in New York, which was ratified but was also disputed as fraudulent. This land purchase was modified by the Third Treaty of Buffalo Creek in 1842 and Fourth Treaty of Buffalo Creek in 1857. In 1856, agents of the company were successfully sued by Seneca John Blacksmith for forcibly evicting him from his sawmill in &quot;Fellows v. Blacksmith&quot;. 

In 1895, the sole surviving trustee of the Ogden Land Company, Charles Appleby, falsely claimed the company had extinguished the aboriginal title to the Allegany and Cattaraugus Reservations, and possessed clear title to them. He attempted to sell the lands to the United States government for $300,000, and funds were appropriated for the purchase in that year&#x27;s Indian Appropriations bill. This measure was supported by David Hill in the Senate but opposed in the House of Representatives and ultimately defeated.

<text>Raymond Georges Yves Tanguy (January 5, 1900 - January 15, 1955), known as just Yves Tanguy (; ), was a French surrealist painter.

==Biography==
Tanguy was the son of a retired navy captain, and was born January 5, 1900, at the Ministry of Naval Affairs on Place de la Concorde in Paris, France. His parents were both of Breton origin. After his father&#x27;s death in 1908, his mother moved back to her native Locronan, Finistère, and he ended up spending much of his youth living with various relatives.

In 1918, Tanguy briefly joined the merchant navy before being drafted into the Army, where he befriended Jacques Prévert. At the end of his military service in 1922, he returned to Paris, where he worked various odd jobs. He stumbled upon a painting by Giorgio de Chirico and was so deeply impressed he resolved to become a painter himself in spite of his complete lack of formal training.

Tanguy had a habit of being completely absorbed by the current painting he was working on. This way of creating artwork may have been due to his very small studio which only had enough room for one wet piece.

Through his friend Prévert, in around 1924 Tanguy was introduced into the circle of surrealist artists around André Breton. Tanguy quickly began to develop his own unique painting style, giving his first solo exhibition in Paris in 1927, and marrying his first wife Jeannette Ducrocq (b. 1896, d. 1977) later that same year. During this busy time of his life, Breton gave Tanguy a contract to paint 12 pieces a year. With his fixed income, he painted less and ended up creating only eight works of art for Breton.

In December 1930, at an early screening of Buñuel and Dalí&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot;, right-wing activists went to the lobby of the cinema where the film was being screened, and destroyed art works by Dalí, Joan Miró, Man Ray, Tanguy, and others.

Throughout the 1930s, Tanguy adopted the bohemian lifestyle of the struggling artist with gusto, leading eventually to the failure of his first marriage. He had an intense affair with Peggy Guggenheim in 1938 when he went to London with his wife Jeannette Ducrocq to hang his first retrospective exhibition in Britain at her gallery &quot;Guggenheim Jeune&quot;. The exhibition was a great success and Guggenheim wrote in her autobiography that &quot;Tanguy found himself rich for the first time in his life&quot;. She purchased his pictures &quot;Toilette de L&#x27;Air&quot; and &quot;The Sun in Its Jewel Case&quot; (Le Soleil dans son écrin) for her collection. Tanguy also painted Peggy two beautiful earrings. The affair continued in both London and Paris and only finished when Tanguy met a fellow Surrealist artist who would become his second wife.

In 1938, after seeing the work of fellow artist Kay Sage, Tanguy began a relationship which led to his second marriage. With the outbreak of World War II, Sage moved back to her native New York, and Tanguy, judged unfit for military service, followed her. He would spend the rest of his life in the United States. Sage and Tanguy were married in Reno, Nevada, on August 17, 1940. Their marriage proved durable but tense. Both drank heavily, and Tanguy assaulted Sage verbally and sometimes physically, pushing her and sometimes even threatening her with a knife privately and at social gatherings. Sage, according to friends&#x27; accounts, made no response to her husband&#x27;s aggression. Toward the end of the war, the couple moved to Woodbury, Connecticut, converting an old farmhouse into an artists&#x27; studio. They spent the rest of their lives there. In 1948, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

In January 1955, Tanguy suffered a fatal stroke at Woodbury. His body was cremated and his ashes preserved until Sage&#x27;s death in 1963. Later, his ashes were scattered by his friend Pierre Matisse on the beach at Douarnenez in his beloved Brittany, together with those of his wife.

== Style and legacy ==
Tanguy&#x27;s paintings have a unique, immediately recognizable style of nonrepresentational surrealism. They show vast, abstract landscapes, mostly in a tightly limited palette of colors, only occasionally showing flashes of contrasting color accents. Typically, these alien landscapes are populated with various abstract shapes, sometimes angular and sharp as shards of glass, sometimes with an intriguingly organic look to them, like giant amoebae suddenly turned to stone.

According to Nathalia Brodskaïa, &quot;Mama, Papa is Wounded!&quot; (1927) is one of Tanguy&#x27;s most impressive paintings. Brodskaïa writes that the painting reflects his debt to Giorgio de Chirico – falling shadows and a classical torso – and conjures up a sense of doom: the horizon, the emptiness of the plain, the solitary plant, the smoke, the helplessness of the small figures. Tanguy said that it was an image he saw entirely in his imagination before starting to paint it. He also claimed he took the title of this and other works from psychiatric textbooks: &quot;I remember spending a whole afternoon with ... André Breton,&quot; he said, &quot;leafing through books on psychiatry in the search for statements of patients which could be used as titles for paintings.&quot; Jennifer Mundy, however, discovered that the title of this painting and several others were taken from a book about paranormal phenomena, &quot;Traité de metaphysique&quot; (1922) by Dr Charles Richet.

Tanguy&#x27;s style was an important influence on several younger painters, such as Roberto Matta, Wolfgang Paalen, Toyen, and Esteban Francés, who adopted a Surrealist style in the 1930s. Later, Tanguy&#x27;s paintings (and, less directly, those of de Chirico) influenced the style of the 1980 French animated movie &quot;Le Roi et l&#x27;oiseau,&quot; by Paul Grimault and Prévert. Tanguy’s works also influenced the science fiction cover art of illustrator Richard Powers.

===In popular culture===
Tanguy&#x27;s &quot;The Invisibles&quot; was a key plot point in the third episode of the second series of BBC Two comedy-drama &quot;There She Goes&quot;.

<doc id="465780" wikidata="Q597393" url="?curid=465780" title="Illegal logging">
<text>Illegal logging is the harvest, transportation, purchase, or sale of timber in violation of laws. The harvesting procedure itself may be illegal, including using corrupt means to gain access to forests; extraction without permission, or from a protected area; the cutting down of protected species; or the extraction of timber in excess of agreed limits. Illegal logging is a driving force for a number of environmental issues such as deforestation, soil erosion and biodiversity loss which can drive larger-scale environmental crises such as climate change and other forms of environmental degradation.

Illegality may also occur during transport, such as illegal processing and export (through fraudulent declaration to customs); the avoidance of taxes and other charges, and fraudulent certification. These acts are often referred to as &quot;wood laundering&quot;.

Illegal logging is driven by a number of economic forces, such as demand for raw materials, land grabbing and demand for pasture for cattle. Regulation and prevention can happen at both the supply side, with better enforcement of environmental protections, and at the demand side, such as an increasing regulation of trade as part of the international lumber industry.

==Overview==
Illegal logging is a pervasive problem, causing enormous damage to forests, local communities, and the economies of producer countries. The EU, as a major timber importer, has implemented the European Union Timber Regulation as a means to halt the import of illegally sourced wood products. The identification of illegally logged or traded timber is technically difficult, but a series of attempts is made. Therefore, a legal basis for normative acts against timber imports or other products manufactured out of illegal wood is missing. Scientific methods to pinpoint the geographic origin of timber are currently under development. Possible actions to restrict imports cannot meet with WTO regulations of non-discrimination. They must instead be arranged in bilateral agreements. TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, strives to monitor the illegal trade of timber and provide expertise in policy and legal reviews.

===Scale===
It is estimated that illegal logging on public land alone causes losses in assets and revenue in excess of US$10 billion annually. Although exact figures are difficult to calculate, given the illegal nature of the activity, decent estimates show that more than half of the logging that takes place globally is illegal, especially in open and vulnerable areas such as the Amazon Basin, Central Africa, Southeast Asia and the Russian Federation.

Available figures and estimates must be treated with caution. Governments tend to underestimate the situation, given that high estimates of illegal logging may cause embarrassment as these to suggest ineffective enforcement of legislation or, even worse, bribery and corruption. On the other hand, environmental NGOs publish alarming figures to raise awareness and emphasize the need for stricter conservation measures. For companies in the forestry sector, publications making high estimates can be regarded as potentially threatening to their reputation and their market perspective, including the competitiveness of wood in comparison to other materials. However, for many countries, NGOs are the only source of information apart from state institutions, which probably clearly underestimates the true figures. For example, the Republic of Estonia calculated a rate of 1% illegally harvested timber in 2003, whereas it was estimated to reach as much as 50% by the NGO &quot;Estonian Green Movement&quot;. In Latvia, the situation is comparable; anecdotal evidence points towards 25% of logging being illegal.

===Consequences===

Illegal logging has detrimental impacts, including deforestation and, consequently, global warming. It leads to biodiversity loss, weakens the rule of law, and hampers responsible forest management. Moreover, it fosters corruption, tax evasion, and diminishes revenue for producer countries, limiting their capacity to invest in sustainable development. The economic and social consequences disproportionately affect the poor and disadvantaged, resulting in the loss of millions of dollars in timber revenue annually.

Furthermore, the illegal trade of forest resources undermines international security, and is frequently associated with corruption, money laundering, organized crime, human rights abuses, climate change and, in some cases, violent conflict. In the forestry sector, cheap imports of illegal timber and forest products, together with the non-compliance of some economic players with basic social and environmental standards, destabilize international markets. This unfair competition affects those European companies, especially the small and medium-sized companies that are behaving responsibly and ready to play by fair rules.

== By region ==

=== Africa ===

==== Madagascar ====
==== Nigeria ====
The indiscriminate logging in the rainforest and uncontrolled felling of trees for fuel wood are reported to have had adverse effect on the environment.  The loss of trees and other vegetation cover can cause temperature increase, fewer crops, flood, increased greenhouse gases within the atmosphere, ecological imbalance, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity. The forest reserve in Nigeria spans approximately 10 million hectares, constituting over 10% of the total land area, which is around 96.2 million hectares or 923,768 square kilometers. The population was about 170,790 in 2006 (National Directorate of Employment, 2012). However, the expanse of marked forest lands has been gradually decreasing due to the rampant tree felling and activities of illegal loggers across the nation. For example, the Federal Department of Forestry (2010) estimated that Nigeria&#x27;s forests are depleting at an annual rate of 3.5%. The country previously had around 20% of its area covered by natural forests, but this has dwindled to about 10%. The loss of approximately 60% of natural forests occurred due to encroachments for agriculture, extensive logging, and urbanization from the 1960s to the year 2000.

Notably, industrial and social development, contending for the same land areas occupied by forests, has not been praiseworthy. Nigeria, given its extensive land area, encompasses diverse and favorable climatic and ecological zones. The nation&#x27;s significant size, diverse population, and socio-political and economic challenges have placed immense pressure on the forest belts. The rise in unemployed youth has revealed that looting forest products for survival presents an opportunity. Consequently, unemployment, a significant developmental challenge in Nigeria, has far-reaching adverse effects on environmental crime. Environmental crime often takes a back seat in priority in most developing nations, as there is a common belief that the forest belongs to everyone in the community. Furthermore, Nigeria&#x27;s over-reliance on crude oil has led the government to place less emphasis on the annual losses from theft of forest produce. Regrettably, the government&#x27;s attempts to implement effective measures to combat illegal logging have not yielded the desired results, with only 6% of the nation&#x27;s land area designated as protected.

According to global data, a significant majority of unemployed individuals in developing regions, both in rural and urban areas, constitute about two-thirds of the total unemployed youth. In Nigeria, unemployment emerged as a pressing issue, particularly since the 1980s, a period marked by economic downturns due to plummeting world petroleum prices, devaluation of the Nigerian currency, rampant corruption, and a rapid increase in the country&#x27;s population. These economic challenges had adverse effects on food production and led to escalating deforestation concerns. In regions that were rural or semi-urban and endowed with abundant forest trees and agricultural produce, the forests were readily accessed and exploited not only by locals but also by foreign criminal networks. Particularly alarming were the activities of illegal traders of forest products, often facilitated by foreigners seeking rare and hard wood species for European and American markets. This resulted in rampant destruction and felling of trees on both communal and individual farmlands. 

From a scientific perspective, the destruction of these trees significantly impacts the carbon cycle and intensifies the greenhouse effect due to carbon depletion. The socio-economic losses to the nation, particularly concerning endangered species in the South-west and Mid-west forest zones of Nigeria (encompassing states such as Oyo, Ondo, Osun, Ogun, Ekiti, Edo, and Delta), are immeasurable. The rapid urbanization in Nigeria, coupled with escalating unemployment rates, persistent poverty, inequalities, inadequate social services, the presence of trans-national criminal organizations, widespread drug use and trafficking, and inadequately equipped security personnel and forest guards to combat illegal logging, lumbering cartels, clandestine markets, and sawmills for rare forest products, have driven many youths to explore opportunities in forest-related businesses.

Illegal logging, lumbering, and sawmilling can be understood as a system with diverse individuals and institutions involved in meeting the industry&#x27;s supply and demand requirements, whether legitimate or illegitimate. Given the unemployment rate in the country, which currently stands at about 20.3 million jobless Nigerians (National Directorate of Employment, 2012), primarily youth, a crucial question arises: how are they sustaining themselves? Undoubtedly, deviant activities tend to thrive in such circumstances, especially in forested areas. The diversity and dynamics of crime and illegalities in the forest belt have received relatively little emphasis, often overshadowed by discussions about environmental degradation and climate change. This study delves into the patterns and trends of illegal wood logging, forest exploitation, and how youths adapt and survive in Nigeria&#x27;s South-West forest belt.

==Statistics==
The scale of illegal logging represents a major loss of revenue to many countries and can lead to widespread associated environmental damage. A senate committee in the Philippines estimated that the country lost as much as US$1.8bn per year during the 1980s. The Indonesian government estimated in 2002 that costs related to illegal logging are US$3bn each year. The World Bank estimates that illegal logging costs timber-producing countries between 10 and 15 billion euros per year. This compares with 10 billion euros disbursed as EC aid in 2002.
* A joint UK-Indonesian study of the timber industry in Indonesia in 1998 suggested that about 40% of throughput was illegal, with a value in excess of $365 million. More recent estimates, comparing legal harvesting against known domestic consumption plus exports, suggest that 88% of logging in the country is illegal in some way. Malaysia is the key transit country for illegal wood products from Indonesia.
* In Brazil, 80% of logging in the Amazon violates government controls. At the core of illegal logging is widespread corruption. Often referred to as &#x27;green gold&#x27;, mahogany can fetch over US$1,600 m-3. Illegal mahogany facilitates the illegal logging of other species, and widespread exploitation of the Brazilian Amazon. Recent Greenpeace investigations in the Brazilian state of Pará reveal just how deeply rooted the problem remains. No reliable legal chain of custody exists for mahogany, and the key players in its trade are ruthless.
* The World Bank estimates that 80% of logging operations are illegal in Bolivia and 42% in Colombia, 10 while in Peru, illegal logging constitutes 80% of all activities.
* Research carried out by WWF International in 2002 shows that in Africa, rates of illegal logging vary from 50% for Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea to 70% in Gabon and 80% in Liberia – where revenues from the timber industry also fuelled the civil war.
* WWF estimates that illegal logging in Russia is at least 20%, reaching up to 50% in its far eastern regions.
* A 2012 joint study by the United Nations Environment Programme and Interpol states that illegal logging accounts for up to 30% of the global logging trade and contributes to more than 50% of tropical deforestation in Central Africa, the Amazon Basin and South East Asia.
* Between 50% and 90% of logging from the key countries in these regions is being carried out by organised criminal entities.
* A study conducted by TRAFFIC found that 93% of all timber exported from Mozambique to China in 2013 was done so illegally.
* As of 2020, Interpol states that every year 10 million hectares of forest are lost to illegal logging across the globe. They also state that the illicit wood sector is worth almost $152 billion per year and up to one-third of all wood furniture is made from illegally sourced timber.

In March 2004, Greenpeace carried out actions against a cargo ship transporting timber from the Indonesian company Korindo, which was being imported into France, UK, Belgium and the Netherlands.
Korindo is known to be using illegal timber from the last rainforests of Indonesia. In May 2003, an Indonesian Government investigation confirmed that Korindo was receiving illegal timber from notorious timber barons known to obtain timber from an orang-utan refuge – the Tanjung Puting National Park.
Tanjung Puting National Park is a 4,000-square-kilometre conservation area of global importance. It is recognized as a world biosphere reserve by the United Nations and forms the largest protected area of swamp forest in South-East Asia.

==Mitigation==
=== North Asia ===
The &quot;Europe and North Asia Forest Law Enforcement and Governance&quot; (ENA FLEG) Ministerial Conference was held in Saint Petersburg, Russia on 22–25 November 2005. In May 2004, the Russian Federation announced its intention to host the ENA FLEG process, supported by the World Bank. A preparatory conference was held in Moscow in June 2005.

The Saint Petersburg conference brought together nearly 300 participants representing 43 governments, the private sector, civil society, and international organizations. It agreed to the &quot;Saint Petersburg Declaration on Forest Law Enforcement and Governance in Europe and North Asia&quot;. The Declaration includes an indicative list of actions, intended to serve as a general framework for possible actions to be undertaken by governments as well as civil society.

The conference took place as the United Kingdom prepared to pass the G8 Presidency to Russia. As Valery Roshchupkin, Head of the Federal Forestry Agency of the Russian Federation, confirmed, illegal logging would be of special importance for Russia as the G8 President and for the following G8 Summit, also held in Saint Petersburg.

=== East Asia ===
The East Asia Forest Law Enforcement and Governance (EA FLEG) Ministerial Conference took place in Bali in September 2001. The Conference brought together nearly 150 participants from 20 countries, representing government, international organizations, NGOs, and the private sector. The event was co-hosted by the World Bank and the Government of Indonesia. The meeting included detailed technical discussions of forest law enforcement in relation to governance, forest policy and forest management as well as ministerial engagement.

The Conference&#x27;s primary aims were to share analysis on forest law enforcement; explore priority issues of forest law enforcement, including illegal logging in the East Asia region, among senior officials from the forest and related ministries, NGOs, and industry representatives; and commit to action at the national and regional level.

=== European Union ===
In May 2003, the European Commission presented the EU Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade Action Plan (EU FLEGT). This marked the beginning of a long process by which the EU aims to develop and implement measures to address illegal logging and related trade. The primary means of implementing the Plan is through Voluntary Partnership Agreements with timber producing countries. The European Union Timber Regulation was adopted in 2010 and went into effect 3 March 2013.
* It prohibits the placing on the EU market for the first time of illegally harvested timber and products derived from such timber;
* It requires EU traders who place timber products on the EU market for the first time to exercise &#x27;due diligence&#x27;;
* Once on the market, the timber and timber products may be sold on and/or transformed before they reach the final consumer.
* To facilitate the traceability of timber products, economic operators in this part of the supply chain (referred to as traders in the regulation) have an obligation to keep records of their suppliers and customers.

A Greenpeace investigation published in May 2014 demonstrates that EU Timber Regulation is ineffective if fraudulent paperwork is accepted at face value and there is not sufficient enforcement by EU authorities.

=== Africa ===
The &quot;Africa Forest Law Enforcement and Governance&quot; (AFLEG) Ministerial Conference was held in Yaoundé, Cameroon, in October 2003. The meeting drew together ministers and stakeholders from Africa, Europe, and North America to consider how partnerships between producers, consumers, donors, civil society and the private sector could address illegal forest exploitation and associated trade in Africa.

The AFLEG conference, the second regional forest law enforcement and governance meeting after East Asia, resulted in endorsement of a ministerial declaration and action plan as well as a variety of informal implementation initiatives.

In 2014, the FAU-EU-FLEGT Programme of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations published the study &quot;The Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) process in Central and West Africa: from theory to practice&quot; to document and foster strategic reflection in partner countries already engaged in negotiating a VPA - or those who will be entering into such negotiations - by providing examples of good practices. These good practices were identified and recorded following interviews with the main stakeholders in the eight VPA countries in West and Central Africa, the European Forest Institute&#x27;s (EFI) EU FLEGT Facility and the European Commission. In 2016, the FAO-EU FLEGT Programme published an additional study, &quot;Traceability: a management tool for business and governments&quot;, providing examples of good practices in the region&#x27;s traceability systems, which help prevent illegal logging by tracking timber from its forest of origin throughout its journey along the supply chain.

===United States===

In response to growing concerns over illegal logging and advice from TRAFFIC and other organisations, on 22 May 2008, the U.S. amended the Lacey Act, when the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 expanded its protection to a broader range of plants and plant products (Section 8204. Prevention of Illegal Logging Practices).

The requirements under the new Amendments are two-fold. First, the Lacey Act now makes it illegal to import into the United States plants that have been harvested contrary to any applicable Federal Law, State Law, Indian Tribal Law, or Foreign Law. If a plant is found to have been harvested in violation of the laws of the country where it was harvested, that plant would be subject to seizure and forfeiture if imported into the U.S. The Lacey Act also makes it unlawful, beginning 15 December 2008, to import certain plants and plant products without a Plant and Plant Product import declaration.

This Plant and Plant Product Declaration must contain (besides other information) the Genus, Species, and Country of Harvest of every plant found in commercial shipments of certain products, a list of applicable products (along with other requirements and guidance) can be found on the USDA APHIS website.

<doc id="465784" wikidata="Q273613" url="?curid=465784" title="Knyaz">
<text>&#x27;, also &#x27;, knjaz or  (), is a historical Slavic title, used both as a royal and noble title in different times. It is usually translated into English as &quot;prince&quot;, &quot;king&quot;, or &quot;duke&quot; depending on specific historical context and the potentially known Latin equivalents at the time, but the word was originally derived from the common Germanic (king).

Feminine forms of the word may be divided into two groups:
* &quot;Princess&quot;, be it princess consort (wife of a reigning prince), princess regnant (reigning princess &quot;suo jure&quot;), or princess regent (reigning on behalf of an underage prince, usually her son after her husband&#x27;s death)
** Belarusian: kniahinia (княгіня) 
** Bulgarian and Russian:  ()
** Slovene and Serbo-Croatian:  (in Serbian Cyrillic: )
** Ukrainian:  (княгиня) 
* &quot;Daughter of the prince&quot;
** Belarusian: kniazioŭna (князёўна) 
** Russian:  (; the son of a &quot;knyaz&quot; is &quot;&quot; ( in its old form).
** Ukrainian:  (князівна). 

The title is pronounced and written similarly in different European languages. In Serbo-Croatian and some West Slavic languages, the word has later come to denote &quot;lord&quot;, and in Czech, Polish and Slovak also came to mean &quot;priest&quot; (, , ) as well as &quot;prince/duke&quot; (, , , ). In Sorbian it means simply &quot;Mister&quot; (from &quot;Master&quot;. Compare French from &quot;my lord&quot;), and the Catholic title &quot;monsignor&quot; for a priest. Today the term is still used as the most common translation of &quot;prince&quot; in Slovenian, Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian literature. is also found as a surname in former Yugoslavia.

==Etymology==
The word is ultimately a cognate of the English &quot;King&quot;, the German &quot;König&quot;, and the Swedish &quot;Konung&quot;. The proto-Slavic form was *, &quot;kŭnędzĭ&quot;; , &quot;kŭnędzĭ&quot;; , &quot;knyaz&quot;; , &quot;knyazĭ&quot;; ; / ; ; ; etc. It is generally considered to be an early borrowing from Proto-Germanic &quot;&quot;, a form also borrowed by Finnish and Estonian (&quot;&quot;).

The rulers of the Duchy of Poland bore the title of , which was rendered as &quot;dux&quot; or &quot;princeps&quot; in Latin, and later adopted &quot;krol&quot; (from &quot;Karl&quot;, the name of Charlemagne) and its equivalent &quot;rex&quot; following Bolesław I&#x27;s coronation in 1025. Similarly, the ruler of the Duchy of Lithuania, called &quot;kunigaikštis&quot; (also derived from &quot;kuningaz&quot;) in Polish, was called &quot;magnus dux&quot; instead of the Polish word for &quot;king&quot;, &quot;&quot; (also derived from &quot;Karl&quot;). Medieval German records, however, translated &quot;knyaz&quot; as &quot;koning&quot; (king) until at least the 15th century.

==Middle Ages==
The meaning of the term changed over the course of history. Initially the term was used to denote the chieftain of a Slavic tribe. Later, with the development of feudal statehood, it became the title of a ruler of a state, and among East Slavs ( (&quot;knyazhestvo&quot;), ) traditionally translated as duchy or principality, for example, of Kievan Rus&#x27;.

===In Medieval Bulgaria===
In First Bulgarian Empire, Boris I of Bulgaria (852–889) changed his title to knyaz after his conversion to Christianity in 864, abandoning the pagan title &#x27;khan&#x27; of his predecessors. The new titles were applied to his sons Vladimir Rasate (889-893) and Simeon I (893–927), however knyaz Simeon took the higher title of tsar soon in 913.

According to Florin Curta, the primary sources have a variety of names for the rulers of the Bulgars before christianisation - such as including ‘rex’, ‘basileus’ and ‘khagan’. Omurtag (814–831) and his son Malamir (831–836) are mentioned in inscriptions as &#x27;kanasubigi&#x27;. However, secondary sources are almost always &#x27;khan&#x27;.

===In Kievan Rus&#x27;===
In Kievan Rus&#x27;, as the degree of centralization grew, the ruler acquired the title &quot;Velikii Knyaz&quot; (Великий Князь) (translated as Grand Prince or Grand Duke, see Russian Grand Dukes). He ruled a or (Grand Duchy), while a ruler of its vassal constituent (&quot;udel&quot;, &quot;udelnoe knyazivstvo&quot; or &quot;volost&quot;) was called &quot;udelny knyaz&quot; or simply &quot;knyaz&quot;.

When Kievan Rus&#x27; became fragmented in the 13th century, the title Knyaz continued to be used in East Slavic states, including Kiev&#x27;s Principality, Chernigov&#x27;s Principality, Novgorod Republic and its princes, Pereiaslavl Principality, Vladimir-Suzdal, Muscovy, Tver&#x27;s Principality, Kingdom of Ruthenia, and in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

== Russia ==

As the Tsardom of Russia gained dominion over much of former Kievan Rus&#x27;, &quot;velikii kniaz&quot; (великий князь) (Great Kniaz) Ivan IV of Russia in 1547 was crowned as Tsar. From the mid-18th century onwards, the title Velikii Kniaz was revived to refer to (male-line) sons and grandsons of Russian Emperors. See titles for Tsar&#x27;s family for details.

&quot;Kniaz&quot; (, ) continued as a hereditary title of Russian nobility patrilineally descended from Rurik (e.g., Belozersky, Belosselsky-Belozersky, Repnin, Gorchakov) or Gediminas (e.g., Galitzine, Troubetzkoy). Members of Rurikid or Gedyminid families were called princes when they ruled tiny quasi-sovereign medieval principalities. After their demesnes were absorbed by Muscovy, they settled at the Moscow court and were authorised to continue with their princely titles.

From the 18th century onwards, the title was occasionally granted by the Tsar, for the first time by Peter the Great to his associate Alexander Menshikov, and then by Catherine the Great to her lover Grigory Potemkin. After 1801, with the incorporation of Georgia into the Russian Empire, various titles of numerous local nobles were controversially rendered in Russian as &quot;kniazes&quot;.

Finally, within the Russian Empire of 1809–1917, Finland was officially called &quot;Grand Principality of Finland&quot; (, , ).

== Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ==
As noted above, the title &quot;knyaz&quot; or &quot;kniaz&quot; became a hereditary noble title in the Grand Duchy of Moscow and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Following the union of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, &quot;kniaź&quot; became a recognised title in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. By the 1630s – apart from the title &quot;pan&quot;, which indicated membership of the large &quot;szlachta&quot; noble class – &quot;kniaź&quot; was the only hereditary title that was officially recognised and officially used in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Notable holders of the title &quot;kniaź&quot; include Jeremi Wiśniowiecki.

==South Slavic countries==

In the 19th century, the Serbian term &quot;knez&quot; (кнез) and the Bulgarian term &quot;knyaz&quot; (княз) were revived to denote semi-independent rulers of those countries, such as Alexander Karađorđević and Alexander of Battenberg. In parts of Serbia and western Bulgaria, &quot;knez&quot; was the informal title of the elder or mayor of a village or zadruga until around the 19th century. Those are officially called &quot;gradonačelnik&quot; (градоначелник) (Serbia) and &quot;gradonachalnik&quot; (градоначалник) or &quot;kmet&quot; (кмет) (Bulgaria).

=== Bulgaria ===
* Prior to Battenberg, the title &quot;knyaz&quot; was born by Simeon I during the First Bulgarian Empire (9th–10th century). At the height of his power, Simeon adopted the title of &quot;tsar&quot; (&quot;emperor&quot;), as did the Bulgarian rulers after the country became officially independent in 1908.
* As of Bulgaria&#x27;s independence in 1908, Knyaz Ferdinand became Tsar Ferdinand, and the words &quot;knyaz&quot; and &quot;knyaginya&quot; began to be used instead for the tsar&#x27;s children – the heir to the throne, for example, held the title &quot;Knyaz Tarnovski&quot; (Prince of Tarnovo&quot;).

===Bosnia===
In early medieval Bosnia &quot;knez&quot; (&quot;knjaz, књаз&quot;) was a title used, along &quot;župan&quot; and duke (&quot;vojvoda&quot;) titles, for Bosnian rulers. One of the first such ruler, recorded in historic documents and later historiography, was Stephen, Duke of Bosnia.

Later it was held by several of most powerful magnates (in Bosnia &quot;vlastelin&quot;) of the era, sometime along with an office title given to a person through service to the monarch, such as Grand Duke of Bosnia (&quot;Veliki vojvoda bosanski&quot;), which was office of the supreme military commander of the realm. Other noble titles included the &quot;knez&quot;, the duke (&quot;vojvoda&quot;) and the &quot;župan&quot;. The title &quot;knez&quot; is equivalent to that of prince. Among most influential of Bosnian nobleman with the title &quot;knez&quot; was Pavle Radinović of Radinović-Pavlović noble family, while other include several noblemen from Radojević-Mirković family, such as Batić Mirković. Further families that bear this title are for example Šantić noble family and most members of Hrvatinić.

===Croatia===
* &quot;knez&quot; was the monarchial title used by the medieval rulers of the Duchy of Lower Pannonia and the Duchy of Croatia from the 7th to the 10th century, who were mostly titled as &quot;dux&quot; and rarely as &quot;princeps&quot; in Latin sources and translated as &quot;Dukes&quot; in English ones.
* &quot;knez&quot; was, in the Late Middle Ages, a hereditary feudal title borne by Croatian vassal noble families who were great territorial magnates of high social class (such as &quot;knezovi Bribirski&quot; (Counts of Bribir), &quot;knezovi Krčki&quot; (Counts of Krk) and &quot;knezovi Zrinski&quot; (Counts of Zrin)) and went by the title of &quot;comes&quot; in Latin and &quot;Count&quot; in English.

===North Macedonia===
The title used in Macedonian historiography for Medieval local leaders.

===Montenegro===
* &quot;knjaz&quot; (књаз) was the ruler title used by the Petrović-Njegoš dynasty in Principality of Montenegro from 1852 until the establishment of Kingdom of Montenegro in 1905, translated as &quot;Prince&quot;.

===Serbia===
* &quot;knez&quot; (кнез) or &quot;knjaz&quot; (књаз) is a common term used in Serbian historiography for Serbian rulers in the Early Middle Ages, who were titled &quot;archon&quot; in Greek.
* &quot;knez&quot; (кнез) or &quot;knjaz&quot; (књаз) was a noble title used by medieval rulers of the Principality of Serbia, Duklja, and Moravian Serbia.
* &quot;knez&quot; (кнез) was a title borne by local Serbian chiefs under the Ottoman Empire. It was another name for the Ottoman Turkish rank of kodjabashi, held by local Christian chiefs.
* &quot;obor-knez&quot; (обор-кнез) was a title borne by elected local native Serbian chiefs of the &quot;nahiyah&quot; (district of a group of villages) in the Ottoman Sanjak of Smederevo (also known as the Belgrade Pashaluk). The obor-knez was senior chief and responsible for his district&#x27;s people and was their spokesman (intermediary) in direct relations with the Pasha, though usually through the &quot;sipahi&quot;, and was in charge of the transfer of taxes levied on the villages.
* &quot;knez&quot; (кнез) or &quot;knjaz&quot; (књаз) was the monarchial title used by Miloš Obrenović in Principality of Serbia, translated as &quot;Prince&quot;. Serbia known as &quot;Kneževina Srbija&quot; (Кнежевина Србија) was &quot;de facto&quot; independent since 1817, becoming &quot;de jure&quot; independent with the 1869 constitution. The successors of Miloš used the title until 1882 when Serbia was elevated into a kingdom.

<doc id="465791" wikidata="Q1102275" url="?curid=465791" title="Clones, County Monaghan">
<text>Clones ( ; , meaning &#x27;meadow of Eois&#x27;) is a small town in the west of County Monaghan in Ireland. The area is part of the Border Region in the Republic of Ireland, earmarked for economic development by the Irish Government due to its currently below-average economic situation. The town was badly hit economically by the Partition of Ireland in 1921 because of its location on the border with County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland. The creation of the Irish border deprived it of access to a large part of its economic hinterland for many years. The town had a population of 1,885 at the 2022 census. The town is in a civil parish of the same name.

== Toponymy ==
Historically Clones was also spelt &quot;Clonis&quot;, &quot;Clonish&quot; and &quot;Clownish&quot;. These are anglicised versions of the Irish &quot;Cluain Eois&quot;, meaning &quot;Eos&#x27;s meadow&quot;. The ancient name was &quot;Cluan Innis&quot;, &quot;island of retreat&quot;, it having formerly been nearly surrounded by water.

== History ==

=== Early Christian Ireland ===
The monastery of Clones was established in the 6th century by St. Tighernach. Tighernach was of the family Uí Cremthainn: one of the many families that made up the kingdom of Airgialla in South Ulster. St. Tighernach had received the benediction of St. Maccartin, granted the bishopric of Clogher and performed many miracles across Ireland, Britain and France. It is said under the direction of an Angel, he erected Clones Monastery in the territory of his grandfather. The monastery of Clones would expand quickly, and Tighernach was consecrated as the first bishop of Clones while retaining his Clogher bishopric, being referred to as &quot;Ferdachrioch&quot;, (man of two districts). The cult of Tighernach, which grew from his legend, was propagated a branch of the Uí Cremthainn who migrated to the Clones area in the 8th century. St. Tighernach became the most popular saint in the Clogher diocese. The Clones abbey of SS Peter and Paul promoted Tighernach outside of the diocese that his cult extended across the British Isles. The succeeding abbots of Clones would be titled &quot;coarb&quot; (successors to the founder of the monastery) and received special privileges in the Clones parish.

=== Norman Ireland ===
During the 12th century, ecclesiastical reform sought to curtail the perceived clerical abuses of the Irish. Like the Clones coarbship, church offices had become hereditary within powerful Gaelic families. As part of the reformation, the Canons Regular of St Augustine established themselves in Clones and set up a monastery. They owned property in Lisdrum, Maguiresbridge and Granshagh. Nevertheless, the Clones coarbship continued to be inherited within families like the McMahons up until the confiscation of Clones parish in the 16th century.

The Norman invasions of the late 13th century saw Clones monastery razed by Hugh de Lacy. In 1211, a motte and bailey were constructed by Normans overlooking Clones but the occupation did not last.

=== Early Modern Ireland ===
Having been confiscated by the English Crown during the Plantations of Ireland, the entire church estate was subsequently leased to Elizabethan explorer Sir Henry Duke in 1587. It was later inherited in 1640 by his descendant, Anne Loftus, granddaughter of Thomas, 1st Viscount Loftus. By 1641, the estate was in the ownership of her husband, who was Richard Lennard-Barrett, owner of the Belhus Estate in Essex. During the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Clones was the site of conflicts between native Gaelic gentry and newly settled planters from Great Britain. The Depositions state that Irish rebels, led by MacMahons of Oriel (Monaghan) hoping to restore their ancestral lands, looted and burned properties now occupied by planters; targeting rich farmers and their tenants. At least thirty-four planters and dozens of Irish rebels were killed over the course of the war.

=== Free State and Republic ===
On 11 February 1922, during the partition of Ireland, there was an armed confrontation in Clones between the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the Ulster Special Constabulary (USC). A unit of armed Special Constables stopped off at Clones railway station while travelling by train from Belfast to Enniskillen (both in Northern Ireland). The Provisional Government of Southern Ireland was unaware any British forces would be crossing through its territory. IRA volunteers called on the USC men to surrender for questioning, but one of them shot dead an IRA sergeant. This sparked a firefight in which four Special Constables were killed and several wounded. Five others were captured. The incident, known as the &quot;Clones Affray&quot;, threatened to spark off a major confrontation between North and South, and the British government temporarily suspended the withdrawal of British troops from the South. A Border Commission was set up to mediate in any future border disputes, but achieved very little.

During The Troubles, on 28 December 1972, a car bomb exploded on Fermanagh Street in Clones, seriously injuring two men. This happened on the same day as the Belturbet bombing in County Cavan which killed two teenagers and injured several other people. The bombings were believed to be the work of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).
This was not the only incident in Clones during the Troubles. On the 16 October 1972 at 11 p.m. a bomb exploded again it was on Fermanagh Street in Clones, at the side of The Creighton Hotel in yard known as the &quot;Butter Yard&quot;, nobody was injured in this attack. Gardaí said they believed the UVF linked loyalist paramilitary group the Red Hand Commandos were behind the bombing.

== Historical Features ==

=== Clones Abbey ===
Clones Abbey was founded in the 6th century by St. Tighernach on land granted by an Irish king. The remains that can be seen today include an Augustinian abbey, round tower, 18th century, pictographic tombstones and the stone sarcophagus of St. Tighernach.

=== Crossmoyle High Cross ===
Cross Moyle (&#x27;Cruisse Mhuile&#x27;, meaning half cross) High Cross is a 15 foot tall or 5 metre (excluding the base) sandstone structure overlooking the Diamond (market place or town square). The shaft and head are separate pieces. The shaft is older dating from 825 to 875 AD, it is decorated with interlacing beads that run up the sides and form a collar at the top. Religious imagery is displayed in compartments which give a chronological summary of the bible. Such depictions include: &#x27;The Fall of Man&#x27;, &#x27;The Adoration of the Magi&#x27; and &#x27;The Multiplication of the Loaves and Fishes&#x27;. The head of the cross complements the shaft, featuring old testament and new testament images on either side.

=== Norman Motte and Bailey ===
The Norman Motte and Bailey are large earthen structures located behind the St Tighearnach&#x27;s Church of Ireland. It consists of a steep central mound situated atop three concentric terraces and a bailey. It was constructed in 1211 and used by the Normans to launch an attack on County Tyrone. The attack resulted in a Norman defeat and the fortification was destroyed in 1212. Reports of &#x27;extensive subterraneous passages&#x27; in relation to the fortification have been made by locals as far back as 1865.

=== St. Tighearnach&#x27;s Church of Ireland ===
St Tighearnach&#x27;s Church of Ireland is a limestone, cruciform Gothic revival Church of Ireland church. A sketch dating to 1586-7 shows evidence of churches being present on the site from before the land was leased to Sir Henry Duke by the English crown. The earliest inscription on St Tighearnach&#x27;s Church reads: 1696. The actual Church of Ireland Parish itself predates this. The earliest recorded Rector of Clones was James Hygate, a native of Scotland, who was appointed in 1609. The 17th century structure was replaced in 1822–25 by a building designed by John Bowden, Board of First Fruits diocesan architect, or his successor William Farrell. It was remodeled in 1857–8 to become a pro-cathedral. It features a steep set of fourteen sandstone steps, a three staged tower with ashlar masonry and a crenellated parapet topped with a spire with pointed-arch windows with chamfered surrounds and hood mouldings.

=== Plantation Castle ===
The Plantation Castle is a 20 ft x 40 ft or 12m x 6m, three story stone structure. The castle was constructed before 1640. A lease for Clones estate in 1636 mentions &#x27;the Castle of Clones&#x27; in the possession of Nicholas Simpson. It lists features including a kitchen, brew house, stable and bawn. In 1641, the Protestant inhabitants of Clones took refuge in the castle after two hundred Jacobites assembled in Clones. The occupants of the castle sallied multiple times and, armed with muskets, harassed the Jacobite forces. This drove the Jacobites into negotiation with the occupants offering the security of their lives and property in exchange for the surrendering of the castle. The defenders acquiesced and returned to their already looted homes. The castle was &#x27;rediscovered&#x27; in 2016 and its story was featured in BBC news and the Irish Times. It is currently owned by Failte Ireland. Clones Community Forum applied for a Heritage Council grant to contract an archaeological team to investigate the site in 2016.

==Railways==
Clones was linked by rail to Dundalk from 1855, Enniskillen from 1859, Cavan from 1862 and Armagh from 1863. Clones railway station was opened on 26 June 1858 by the Dundalk and Enniskillen Railway. From 1876 all of these lines were part of the Great Northern Railway (GNR).

The Partition of Ireland in 1922 made Clones a border post on the railway, which combined with road competition to cause the Great Northern to decline. In 1954, the governments of the Republic and Northern Ireland jointly nationalised the GNR and in 1957 Northern Ireland made the GNR close its lines from Armagh and Enniskillen to Clones. This made it impractical to continue services on the Cavan and Dundalk lines so the GNR withdrew passenger services on those lines as well, leaving Clones with no passenger trains and a freight service truncated at the border. The GNR closed Clones station to passenger traffic on 14 October 1957.

In 1958 the two states partitioned the GNR between the Ulster Transport Authority and CIÉ. CIÉ withdrew freight services from the Cavan line in 1959 and from the Dundalk line in 1960, leaving Clones with no railway at all. CIÉ closed Clones freight depot on 1 January 1960.

== Rivers and canal ==

The Finn River, which rises a few miles north-west of Roslea in the south-east of County Fermanagh, flows immediately to the south of Clones, while a stream called the Lacky River (also known as the Killylacky River) flows along the northern, western and south-western outskirts of Clones. The source of the Lacky River is Killylacky Lough, just to the west of Aghadrumsee in the south-east of County Fermanagh. The Lacky River flows into the Finn River close to Annies Bridge, just south-south-west of Clones, between Clones and Scotshouse.

The Cavan Road (part of the A3/N54) and the Newtownbutler Road (part of the A34) both cross the Lacky River on the outskirts of Clones, as do two sideroads: the Lacky Road and the Magheraveely Road.

The national inland waterways agency, Waterways Ireland, is planning to restore the Ulster Canal from the Wattlebridge area of Upper Lough Erne to Clones.

== Sport ==

Clones is now mainly known in Ireland as being the location of the GAA stadium, St Tiernach&#x27;s Park also the home of Monaghan GAA. This stadium is regularly used for inter-county matches during the Ulster provincial championship in Gaelic football, and traditionally hosts the final. The summer football season was therefore a major source of revenue for businesses in the town.
The PEACE Link Clones is a sporting facility on the edge of Clones. Its facilities include a 400m running track, in-field grass pitch, a 3G multi-purpose playing pitch, an indoor sports centre, changing facilities, and a gym.

A greyhound racing track operated from 1935 until 1962. The track was opened by the Clones Greyhound Racing Company Limited and raced under the Irish Coursing Club Rules up until November 1939 and later unlicensed until 1962. William Mealiff was a founding member of the company and the track was on the land near Bishopscourt. The pitch inside the track hosted a Clones rugby team that was formed in 1935.

<text>Benincasa hispida, the wax gourd, also called ash gourd, white gourd, winter gourd, winter melon, tallow gourd, ash pumpkin, Chinese preserving melon, is a vine grown for its very large fruit, eaten as a vegetable when mature. 
It is native to South and Southeast Asia. The wax gourd is widely grown throughout Asia, including Java and Japan, the places where it is thought to have originated.

One variety of the plant, called &quot;chi qua&quot; (&quot;Benincasa hispida&quot; var. &quot;chieh-qua&quot;), is commonly used in Asian cuisine.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;winter melon&quot; that is sometimes given to this plant is based on the Chinese name (); however, the character () can also mean &quot;gourd&quot; or &quot;squash&quot;. It is likely that the name &quot;melon&quot; is given because this gourd is sometimes candied or made into a sweet tea.

The name &quot;wax gourd&quot; comes from the wax coating in the fruit&#x27;s skin.

== Description ==
The plant grows thick vines with coarse and hairy stems. It has large, rough leaves with a width between long.

In early summer from June to September, golden yellow flowers form in the leaf axils.

=== Fruit ===
After they are fertilized, they bear obloid fruits 50–60 cm long by 10–25 cm wide; young fruits are covered with soft fuzzy hairs which eventually disappear and develop a waxy coating that gives the fruit a long shelf life of up to a year.

The melon may grow as large as 80 cm in length. The fruit has thick flesh that is sweet, crisp and juicy; it has white or yellow seeds.

== Cultivation ==
It is grown in well-drained loam and sandy soils in warm, mild climates, and will not tolerate frosts. It is grown in riverbeds or furrows, and needs constant irrigation during the growing season.

== Uses ==
=== Culinary ===
The wax gourd can be stored for many months, much like winter squash. Ash gourds of the Indian subcontinent have a white coating with a rough texture (hence the name ash gourd). Southeast Asian varieties have a smooth waxy texture. It is one of the few vegetables available during winter in areas of deciduous vegetation. In India, the wax gourd is recognized for its medicinal properties in the Ayurvedic system of medicine. It also has significance in spiritual traditions of India and Yoga, where it is identified as a great source of prana.
In Cambodia, it is known as &quot;tralach&quot; (), and used in soup and stews in Cambodian cuisine. It is commonly used to make &quot;samlor tralach&quot;, which is winter gourd and pork soup, or stuffed pork in the gourd.

In Chinese cuisine, the gourds are used in stir fries or combined with pork or pork/beef bones to make winter gourd soup, often served in the scooped out gourd, carved by scraping off the waxy coating. It is also chopped and candied as wintermelon candy (dōng guā táng), commonly eaten at New Year festivals, or as filling for Sweetheart cake (lǎopó bǐng). It has also been used as the base filling in Chinese and Taiwanese mooncakes for the Moon Festival.

In Vietnamese cuisine, it is called &quot;bí đao&quot;, and is usually used to make soup or stew. When cooked with pork short ribs, the resulting soup is traditionally thought to help produce more milk for breastfeeding mothers.

In the Philippines, it is candied (referred to plainly as &quot;kundol&quot;) and is used as a pastry filling for hopia. It is also an ingredient in some savory soups (&quot;sabaw&quot;) and stir-fries (&quot;guisado&quot;).

In Indian cuisine it is traditionally used to prepare a wide variety of dishes. In northern India it is used to prepare a candy called &quot;petha&quot;. In South Indian cuisine, it is traditionally used to make a variety of curries, including sāmbār and a stew (&quot;mōr kuḻambu&quot;, made with a yogurt base. The juice of the raw ash gourd (Maipawl or Khar) is used by the Mizo community and indigenous Assamese ethnicities of North-East India as a natural remedy to treat mild to severe dysentery. In north India, particularly in the middle Himalayas, it is paired with pulses such as moong which, when crushed, along with winter gourd, make a dish locally called &quot;bori&quot;. When dried in sunlight it becomes somewhat hard and is used in curry dishes and eaten with rice or chapati. This practice is especially prevalent in the Himalayas due to the long shelf life of the resulting product.

In western Bihar as well as eastern Uttar Pradesh, it is called &quot;bhathua&quot; (भथुआ). In Sri Lanka, it is called &quot;puhul&quot; (පුහුල්) and &quot;alu puhul&quot; (අළු පුහුල්). In Andhra Pradesh, it is called Boodida Gummadikaya (బూడిద గుమ్మడికాయ) (Telugu). It is used to make stews, stir fries and vadialu. Vadialu are made by chopping the gourd in small pieces and mixing with ground urad beans and spices, then sun-drying. To eat, vadialu are deep fried in oil and eaten as an accompaniment to rice and sambar or lentil stews.

It is known as Kohalaa (कोहळा) in the Marathi language. Kohala is used to prepare a sweet dish called Kohalyachi Vadee, a kind of Barfi. It is also used to make Sambar.

In Gujarat, it is called kolu (કોળુ).

In Bengal, it is called &quot;ChaalKumro&quot; (চালকুমড়ো ). There are various dished made with it, viz., ChalKumro’r Bora, Chalkumro ghonto, Chalkumror dudh curry, with mung dal, etc.

In Odisha it is called (ପାଣି କଖାରୁ), it is used in various types of recipe all over Odisha. It is the main ingredient to prepare a very tasty candy like food (ବଡ଼ି) for curry or as a supplement mainly with watered rice.

In Nepal, where it is called Kubhindo, it is cooked as a vegetable when young, but the ripe gourds are usually made into preserves or crystallized candy known as &quot;murabba&quot; or &quot;petha&quot;.
Occasionally, it is used to produce a fruit drink with a distinctive taste. It is usually sweetened with caramelized sugar. In Southeast Asia, the drink is marketed as wax gourd tea or wax gourd punch.

The shoots, tendrils, and leaves of the plant may also be eaten as greens.

===Other purposes===
The ash gourd is also used by Hindus as a sacrificial offering in lieu of animal sacrifice. The gourd is marked with vermillion and split in two with a sword.

In Kerala, the plant is called കുമ്പളം &quot;kumbalam&quot; and the fruit is called കുമ്പളങ്ങ &quot;kumbalanga&quot; or കൂശ്മാണ്ടം &quot;kooshmandam&quot;. It is traditionally used to offer &#x27;Guruthi&#x27; (ഗുരുതി) instead of &#x27;Kuruti&#x27; (കുരുതി) among Malayali Brahmins. Thus, instead of offering someone&#x27;s life in the pyre, an ash gourd is cut into two as a symbolic performance in lieu of human sacrifice.

In Karnataka, the ash gourd is known as Boodu Kumbalakaayi (ಬೂದು ಕುಂಬಳಕಾಯಿ) (Kannada) and Boldu Kumbda in Tulu, and is used to prepare dishes like Kodel (Sambhar), Ale bajji, Kashi Halwa and chutney.
It is widely used during Dasara and other festivities while performing pooje.

Its fruit was often dried as containers to store infused coconut oil among Polynesians (known as &quot;fa&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)&quot;gu&quot; or &quot;hue ʻaroro&quot; – latter not to be confused with the other &quot;hue&quot; gourd).

== 2020 mystery seed mail ==
In summer of 2020, several states across the U.S. reported mysterious, unsolicited packages containing unknown and unidentified seeds of various kinds - the envelopes presented Chinese text in many cases. At least one person planted one type of these seeds, which grew and was analyzed before state officials destroyed the plant. This proved to be &quot;Benincasa hispida&quot;.

<text>César-François Cassini de Thury (17 June 1714 – 4 September 1784), also called Cassini III or Cassini de Thury, was a French astronomer and cartographer.

== Biography ==

Cassini de Thury was born in Thury-sous-Clermont, in the Oise department, the second son of Jacques Cassini and Suzanne Françoise Charpentier de Charmois. He was a grandson of Giovanni Domenico Cassini, and would become the father of Jean-Dominique Cassini, Comte de Cassini.

In 1739, he became a member of the French Academy of Sciences as a supernumerary adjunct astronomer, in 1741 as an adjunct astronomer, and in 1745 as a full member astronomer.

In January 1751, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

Cassini de Thury succeeded his father&#x27;s official position in 1756 and continued the hereditary surveying operations. In 1744, he began the construction of a great topographical map of France, one of the landmarks in the history of cartography. Completed by his son Jean-Dominique, and published by the Académie des Sciences from 1744 to 1793, its 180 plates are known as the Cassini map.

The post of director of the Paris Observatory was created for his benefit in 1771 when the establishment ceased to be a dependency of the French Academy of Sciences. A letter and proposal sent by Cassini de Thury to the Royal Society in London instigated the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790), which measured the precise distance and direction between the Paris Observatory and the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, by way of a trigonometric survey.

His chief works are: &quot;La méridienne de l’Observatoire Royal de Paris&quot; (1744), an arc measurement correction of the Paris meridian (Dunkirk-Collioure arc measurement (Cassini de Thury and de Lacaille)); &quot;Description géométrique de la terre&quot; (1775); and &quot;Description géométrique de la France&quot; (1784), which was completed by his son (&quot;&quot;).

César-François Cassini de Thury died of smallpox in Paris on 4 September 1784.

<text>Jean-Dominique, comte de Cassini (30 June 174818 October 1845), also called Cassini IV, was a French astronomer, son of César-François Cassini de Thury and great-grandson of Giovanni Domenico Cassini.

Cassini was born at the Paris Observatory. He succeeded his father as director of the observatory in 1784; but his plans for its restoration and re-equipment were wrecked in 1793 by the animosity of the National Assembly. His position having become intolerable, he resigned on 6 September and was thrown into prison in 1794, but released after seven months. He then withdrew to Thury, where he died in 1845.

In 1770, he published an account of a voyage to America in 1768, undertaken as the commissary of the French Academy of Sciences with a view to testing Pierre Le Roy’s watches at sea. In 1783, his father César-François Cassini de Thury had sent a letter to the Royal Society in London, in which he proposed a trigonometric survey connecting the observatories of Paris and Greenwich for the purpose of better determining the latitude and longitude of the latter. His proposal was accepted, resulting in the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790).
The results of the survey were published in 1791.

Dominique, comte de Cassini visited England with Pierre Méchain and Adrien-Marie Legendre, and the three met William Herschel at Slough. He completed his father&#x27;s map of France, which was published by the Academy of Sciences in 1793. It served as the basis for the &quot;Atlas National&quot; (1791), showing France in departments. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1788.

Cassini&#x27;s &quot;Mémoires pour servir à l’histoire de l’observatoire de Paris&quot; (1810) embodied portions of an extensive work, the prospectus of which he had submitted to the Academy of Sciences in 1774. The volume included his &quot;Eloges&quot; of several academicians, and the biography of his great-grandfather.

His wife was Claude Marie Louise de Lamyre-Mory Comtesse de Neuville (1754–1791) and their youngest son Henri was a botanist.

<text>Katherine Linn Sage (June 25, 1898 – January 8, 1963), usually known as Kay Sage, was an American Surrealist artist and poet active between 1936 and 1963. A member of the Golden Age and post-war periods of Surrealism, she is mostly recognized for her artistic works, which typically contain themes of an architectural nature. 

Through her marriage to an Italian prince, she became princess of San Faustino in 1925, and a member of American royalty. She was also the sister-in-law of Donna Virginia Bourbon del Monte, wife of industrialist Edoardo Agnelli of the Agnelli family.

==Biography==
Sage was born in Albany, New York, into a family made wealthy from the timber industry. Her father, Henry M. Sage, was a state assemblyman the year after her birth and later was a five-term state senator. Her mother was Anne Wheeler (Ward) Sage. Sage had an elder sister, Anne Erskine Sage.

===Early life===
Anne Wheeler Ward Sage left her husband and older daughter soon after Kay&#x27;s birth to live and travel in Europe with Kay as her companion. She and Henry Sage divorced in 1908, but Henry Sage continued to support his ex-wife and younger daughter, and Kay visited him and his new wife in Albany occasionally and wrote him frequent letters.
Kay and her mother established a home in Rapallo, Italy, but visited many other places as well, including Paris. Katherine became fluent in French and Italian, speaking colloquial versions of these languages that she learned from the servants who helped to raise her. She attended a number of schools, including the Foxcroft School in Virginia, where she became a lifelong friend of the heiress Flora Payne Whitney.

As a child she drew and wrote as hobbies, but her first formal training in painting was at the Corcoran Art School in Washington, D.C., in 1919–1920. After she and her mother went back to Italy in 1920, she studied art in Rome for several years, learning conventional techniques and styles. She particularly enjoyed painting outdoors in the Roman Campagna with teacher Oronato Carlandi and fellow students. Much later, Sage stated that &quot;these were the happiest days of my life&quot;, and she told friend and gallery owner Julien Levy in 1961 that her campagna experience shaped her &quot;perspective idea of distance and going away.&quot; Nonetheless, in later years Sage usually claimed that she was self-taught perhaps because, as one of her biographers, Judith Suther, states, most of what she had learned in Rome bore so little relationship to the kind of painting she eventually did that &quot;she &quot;felt&quot; as if she had studied with no one.&quot;

Sage met a young Italian nobleman, Ranieri Bourbon del Monte Santa Maria, Prince di San Faustino, in Rome around 1923 and fell in love with him, believing at first, as she wrote to a friend in 1924, that he was &quot;&quot;me&quot; in another form.&quot; They married on March 30, 1925. For ten years the couple lived the idle life of upper-class Italians, which Sage later described as &quot;a stagnant swamp.&quot; She looked back on that time as years that she simply &quot;threw away to the crows. No reason, no purpose, nothing.&quot; Her husband was content with their lifestyle, but Sage was not: as she wrote in her autobiography, &quot;China Eggs,&quot; &quot;Some sort of inner sense in me was reserving my potentialities for something better and more constructive.&quot;

===Surrealism and Tanguy===

Perhaps spurred by the deaths of her father in 1933 and her sister, from tuberculosis, in 1934 (Anne had joined Kay and her mother in Italy in the 1920s, and the sisters became quite close during Anne&#x27;s final illness), Sage left her husband in 1935 with plans to build an independent life as an artist; they obtained a papal annulment of their marriage several years later. In December 1936, as she prepared to leave Italy and move to Paris, Sage had her first solo art exhibit, six oil paintings shown at the Galleria del Milione in Milan. In &quot;A House of Her Own,&quot; her 1997 biography of Sage, Judith Suther describes these works as &quot;experimental abstract compositions.&quot;

Sage moved to Paris in March 1937 and rented a luxurious apartment there. In early 1938 she saw the International Surrealist Exhibit at Galerie Beaux-Arts; consisting of 299 pieces by 60 artists from 14 countries. She was especially struck by the paintings of Italian artist Giorgio de Chirico, which featured what Magdalena Holzhey, in a book devoted to de Chirico, calls &quot;empty squares and receding depths, shadowy arcades and soaring towers.&quot; Sage bought one of de Chirico&#x27;s paintings, &quot;La Surprise,&quot; and kept it all her life.

This exposure to Surrealism inspired Sage to begin painting in earnest. She exhibited six of her new oils in the Salon des Surindépendants show at the Porte de Versailles in the fall of 1938. These semiabstract paintings, including &quot;Afterwards&quot; and &quot;The World Is Blue,&quot; borrowed motifs and styles from de Chirico and the Surrealists but showed hints of Sage&#x27;s own future work as well. Art historian Whitney Chadwick states that Sage&#x27;s paintings were &quot;imbued with an aura of purified form and a sense of motionlessness and impending doom found nowhere else in Surrealism.&quot; Around this time the artist began signing her works &quot;Kay Sage.&quot;

Several stories are told about Sage&#x27;s meeting with her future husband, Surrealist artist Yves Tanguy. One came from Greek poet Nicolas Calas, who recalled that he and Tanguy accompanied Surrealist leader André Breton to the Surindépendants exhibit and were impressed enough by Sage&#x27;s paintings to seek her out. Calas claimed that Breton was sure that the paintings must have been made by a man.

Tanguy at the time was married to Jeannette Ducroq, but they were separated, and he and Sage immediately fell in love. Sage, still well off, was generous with her money and the group of impoverished artists badly needed such support, but some resented her wealth and what they felt was a haughty attitude that fitted her former title of &quot;Princess&quot; all too well. Her alliance with Tanguy contributed to a rift between Tanguy and Breton, who had formerly been close friends. Nonetheless, Sage continued to call herself a Surrealist.

Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, beginning World War II, and Sage sailed back to the United States a month later. She immediately set up plans to help the Surrealists immigrate as well and establish themselves in the new country by means of art exhibitions—starting with Tanguy, who joined her in New York City in November. She arranged for Tanguy to have a solo show at the New York gallery of Pierre Matisse, son of the famous painter Henri Matisse, a month after he arrived. Sage had her own solo show, her first in the United States, at the same gallery in June 1940. Sage and Tanguy married on August 17, 1940, in Reno, Nevada, after he obtained a final divorce from duCroq.

===Mature work===

Sage did the bulk of her mature work between 1940, when she married Tanguy, and 1955, when he died suddenly from a cerebral hemorrhage. During most of that time the two artists lived at Town Farm in Woodbury, Connecticut. (They leased a house in the area beginning in 1941 but maintained a New York apartment for a while as well; in 1946 they purchased the farm and moved to Woodbury permanently.) They converted a barn on the farm into his-and-hers studios, separated by a partition with a door. Their large home was decorated with numerous pieces of Surrealist art and a variety of unusual objects, including a stuffed raven in a cage and an Eskimo mask.

Although the Tanguys visited, and were visited by, many members of both the French expatriate and American art communities, such as mobile designer Alexander Calder and his family, they had difficulty keeping close friends. &quot;Again and again Sage is described [by people who knew her] as imperious, forbidding, moody, quick to anger, remote, private, solitary, aloof, contradictory, and unapproachable,&quot; Judith Suther writes. Tanguy, though friendlier, became notorious for his behavior when drunk, which included grabbing the heads of other men at a gathering and striking them hard and repeatedly with his own.

During these years Sage&#x27;s art gained a solid reputation among art critics, though she found it difficult to emerge from the shadow of the better-known Tanguy. Her work was regularly included in national exhibits, won prizes, and was sold to major art museums. In 1943, Sage&#x27;s work was included in Peggy Guggenheim&#x27;s show &quot;Exhibition by 31 Women&quot; at the Art of This Century gallery in New York. She had several solo shows at the galleries of Julien Levy and, beginning in 1950, Catherine Viviano in New York. &quot;In the Third Sleep&quot; won the Watson F. Blair Purchase Prize from the Art Institute of Chicago in October 1945, Sage&#x27;s first major public recognition. In 1951, &quot;All Soundings Are Referred to High Water&quot; won first prize in oils at the Eastern States Exposition of Connecticut Contemporary Art, and &quot;Nests of Lightning&quot; won first honorable mention in the 22nd Corcoran Biennial Exhibition of Contemporary American Painting. Sage and Tanguy had a large joint exhibition at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut—their first and almost only exhibition together—in August and September 1954.

===Last years and death===

The relationship between Kay Sage and Yves Tanguy was as enigmatic as their art. At the same parties during which he banged his head against those of other men, Tanguy assaulted Sage verbally and sometimes physically, pushing her and sometimes even threatening her with a knife. Sage, according to friends&#x27; accounts, made no response to her husband&#x27;s aggression except to try to persuade him to go home. Friends also said that Tanguy did not like Sage&#x27;s painting and felt jealous of the fame that came to her. However contentious or abusive their relationship was, Sage was devastated by Tanguy&#x27;s death. &quot;Yves was my only friend who understood everything,&quot; she wrote to Jehan Mayoux, an old friend of Tanguy&#x27;s, about a month after Tanguy&#x27;s fatal stroke.

Sage did fewer new paintings after Tanguy died, partly because of her depression and partly because of her decreasing eyesight due to cataracts. Instead, she devoted her time to two projects: preserving Tanguy&#x27;s reputation through retrospective shows and a complete catalogue of his work, and writing poetry, mostly in the slangy French she had learned in her youth and spoken with Tanguy. With the help of longtime friend Marcel Duhamel—and her own subsidies to cover most of the printing costs—Sage arranged for a book of this poetry, &quot;Demain, Monsieur Silber,&quot; to be published in France in June 1957. Around 1955 she also wrote a partial autobiography, &quot;China Eggs,&quot; which covered her life up to about the time she left San Faustino, but she never tried to publish it.

One of the chief paintings in a show of 13 of Sage&#x27;s oils at the Viviano Gallery in November 1958 was called &quot;The Answer Is No.&quot; This seems to have reflected Sage&#x27;s own state of mind. She filed her will in Waterbury in December 1958, and on April 28–29, 1959, a few weeks after she completed a massive catalogue of Tanguy&#x27;s paintings, she attempted to end her life with an overdose of sleeping pills. A housekeeper found her, however, and she was revived.

In 1959 and 1960 she underwent operations to remove her cataracts, which she had formerly refused to do. Unfortunately, the surgeries were painful and had only limited success, and by this time she was suffering from other health problems as well, including some that may have resulted from her years of heavy smoking and drinking. During 1960 and 1961, as a substitute for painting, she made small sculptures of wire, stones, bullets, and other unusual materials. Catherine Viviano hosted a show of these objects, titled &quot;Your Move,&quot; in November 1961, as well as a major retrospective show of Sage&#x27;s paintings in April 1960.

Sage wrote in a journal in August 1961, &quot;I have said all that I have to say. There is nothing left for me to do but scream.&quot; On January 8, 1963, she put a fatal bullet through her heart. Following instructions in her will, Pierre Matisse buried urns containing Sage&#x27;s and Tanguy&#x27;s ashes in the water off the coast of Tanguy&#x27;s native Brittany in 1964.

==Art and writing==

===Poetry and writing===
Kay Sage is known chiefly as a visual artist. However, she also wrote five volumes of poetry, chiefly in French, including &quot;Faut dire c&#x27;qui est,&quot; in September 1959. She wrote four short plays and an unpublished autobiography, &quot;China Eggs.&quot;

===Artistic style===

Kay Sage consistently identified herself as a Surrealist, and authors who have written about her usually do so as well. One of her biographers, Judith Suther, writes: 
:I call Kay Sage a Surrealist because her painting resonates with the unsettling paradoxes and hallucinatory qualities prized by André Breton and his group. . . . More fundamentally, I call Sage a Surrealist because her allegiance to the Surrealist identity lies at the heart of her self-image as an artist.

Critics during Sage&#x27;s lifetime frequently compared her work to that of Tanguy, who was better known, and usually assumed that, when their work had features in common, those features must have originated with him. More recent feminist scholars have stated that the influence more likely was mutual—what Judith Suther calls &quot;a constant, usually unconscious interchange.&quot; Suther and others also point out differences between the two artists: for example, the large architectural constructions that dominate Sage&#x27;s paintings are quite unlike the smaller biomorphic or metallic forms that people associate with Tanguy&#x27;s landscapes.

Both Suther and Régine Tessier, the latter in a sketch of Sage in &quot;Notable American Women: The Modern Period,&quot; note key features of Sage&#x27;s mature work. Most of Sage&#x27;s paintings focus on free-standing architectural structures, including walls, towers, and latticework, which could represent buildings either under construction or ruined and decaying. Her use of arched entryways and slanted perspectives may in be attributed to the painter Giorgio de Chirico. Some contain figures that might or might not be human, hidden by flowing drapery. (&quot;Le Passage,&quot; one of Sage&#x27;s last paintings, is perhaps the only one containing a definite human figure; even &quot;Small Portrait,&quot; thought by many to be a self-portrait, is hardly recognizable as a face.) Like Tanguy, Sage often sets her objects on deserts or plains that recede to immeasurably distant horizons. She renders her forms in meticulous, photographic detail, using a gray-green-ochre palette that Tessier describes as &quot;reminiscent of the sulphurous light before a thunderstorm&quot;. Critics frequently called Sage&#x27;s work disturbing or depressing, even when they praised her painterly skill.

Sage almost never commented on what her paintings represented or how their seemingly ominous mood should be interpreted. One exception was her statement to a &quot;Time&quot; magazine critic that &quot;The Instant,&quot; a painting that appeared in her 1950 show at the Catherine Viviano gallery, was &quot;a sort of showing of what&#x27;s inside—things half mechanical, half alive.&quot;

===Books===

In addition to her autobiography, &quot;China Eggs,&quot; and four Surrealist one-act plays, Sage wrote several books of poetry, three in French, one in English and one in Italian. There are also more than two hundred unpublished poems in the Archives of American Art (Flora Whitney Miller Papers, and sixty unpublished poems in the Stephen Robeson Miller Research Papers about Kay Sage, see citation below.) Their style is colloquial, their wit sharp and often directed at herself. Many are dialogues, perhaps imagined conversations with Tanguy (with whom she spoke the same kind of street-language French she used in the poems) or perhaps discussions between different parts of herself. Her published works are:

*&quot;Piove in giardino&quot; (1937)
*&quot;Demain, Monsieur Silber&quot; (1957)
*&quot;The More I Wonder&quot; (1957, probably a translation into English of &quot;Demain, Monsieur Silber&quot;)
*&quot;Faut dire c&#x27;qui est&quot; (1959)
*&quot;Mordicus&quot; (1962)

Miller included with the plays a fifty page abridged version, with revisions, of his 1983 one-hundred page chronology in the Archives of American Art on microfilm reel nos. 2886-2888 which extensively incorporated selected quotations from his interviews and correspondence with people who knew Sage and which forms part of the collection named by the AAA &quot;The Stephen Robeson Miller Research Papers about Kay Sage, 1898–1983&quot;.

(Stephen Robeson Miller also regrets that in his Chronology in the Kay Sage Catalogue Raisonne, published in 2018, there was not time before the book went to press to include the following correction: Sage saw her first Tanguy painting Je vous attends (I await you), 1934, at the Galerie Charpentier in Paris in January 1935, not at the same gallery during the summer of 1936. Proof of this information is the checklist of the exhibition called &quot;Le Temps Present: Peinture, Sculpture, Gravure: 1er Exposition de 1935&quot; held from January 10–28 at the Galerie Charpentier, Paris, with Tanguy&#x27;s painting listed as number 232, which Dr. Charles Stuckey at the Pierre Matisse Foundation, New York, located at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and provided to Mr. Miller).

*Suther, Judith D. &quot;A House of Her Own: Kay Sage, Solitary Surrealist.&quot; Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1997. The author stated in her Acknowledgements that Miller had abandoned his book on Sage, but this was not possible because Miller&#x27;s citation in Books in Print with Nelmar Press predated Suther&#x27;s 1997 citation in Books in Print, and demonstrated his plan to publish further. Although Miller and Suther had briefly discussed collaborating on a book about Sage, their collaboration never materialized because Miller decided he wanted to do his own book, namely a catalogue raisonne with his commentary about her paintings, Sage&#x27;s unpublished one-act plays, and his one-hundred page Chronological Biography in the Archives of American Art. Miller&#x27;s shorter, abridged (fifty page) 2011 Chronology published by the Gallery of Surrealism, New York, provides the source for each entry and includes, for example, a letter Sage wrote to Flora Whitney Miller stating that she brought her mother with her from Rapallo to New York in 1939. While it is true that occasionally a secondary source had provided Miller with information which later proved factually erroneous, the &quot;contemporary primary source material&quot; of Sage&#x27;s 1939 letter to Flora Whitney Miller stating that she had brought her mother with her at that time to NYC is indisputable, and is contrary to what Suther wrote in her book without providing a source.

<text>The pygmy sperm whale (Kogia breviceps) is one of two extant species in the family Kogiidae in the sperm whale superfamily. They are not often sighted at sea, and most of what is known about them comes from the examination of stranded specimens.

==Taxonomy==

The pygmy sperm whale was first described by naturalist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1838. He based this on the head of an individual washed up on the coasts of Audierne in France in 1784, which was then stored in the Muséum d&#x27;histoire naturelle. He recognized it as a type of sperm whale and assigned it to the same genus as the sperm whale (&quot;Physeter macrocephalus&quot;) as &quot;Physeter breviceps&quot;. He noted its small size and nicknamed it &quot;cachalot a tête courte&quot;–small-headed sperm whale; further, the species name &quot;breviceps&quot; is Latin for &quot;short-headed&quot;. In 1846, zoologist John Edward Gray erected the genus &quot;Kogia&quot; for the pygmy sperm whale as &quot;Kogia breviceps&quot;, and said it was intermediate between the sperm whale and dolphins.

In 1871, mammalogist Theodore Gill assigned it and &quot;Euphysetes&quot; (now the dwarf sperm whale, &quot;Kogia sima&quot;) to the subfamily Kogiinae, and the sperm whale to the subfamily Physeterinae. Both have now been elevated to the family level. In 1878, naturalist James Hector synonymized the dwarf sperm whale with the pygmy sperm whale, with both being referred to as &quot;K. breviceps&quot; until 1998.

==Description==
The pygmy sperm whale is not much larger than many dolphins. They are about at birth, growing to about at maturity. Adults weigh about . The underside is a creamy, occasionally pinkish colour and the back and sides are a bluish grey; however, considerable intermixing occurs between the two colours. The shark-like head is large in comparison to body size, given an almost swollen appearance when viewed from the side. A whitish marking, often described as a &quot;false gill&quot;, is seen behind each eye.

The lower jaw is very small and slung low. The blowhole is displaced slightly to the left when viewed from above facing forward. The dorsal fin is very small and hooked; its size is considerably smaller than that of the dwarf sperm whale and may be used for diagnostic purposes.

==Anatomy==

Like its giant relative, the sperm whale, the pygmy sperm whale has a spermaceti organ in its forehead (see sperm whale for a discussion of its purpose). It also has a sac in its intestines that contains a dark red fluid. The whale may expel this fluid when frightened, perhaps to confuse and disorient predators.

Dwarf and pygmy sperm whales possess the shortest rostrum of current day cetaceans with a skull that is greatly asymmetrical.

Pygmy sperm whales have from 50 to 55 vertebrae, and from 12 to 14 ribs on either side, although the latter are not necessarily symmetrical, and the hindmost ribs do not connect with the vertebral column. Each of the flippers has seven carpals, and a variable number of phalanges in the digits, reportedly ranging from two in the first digit to as many as 10 in the second digit. No true innominate bone exists; it is replaced by a sheet of dense connective tissue. The hyoid bone is unusually large, and presumably has a role in the whale&#x27;s suction feeding.
===Teeth===
The pygmy sperm has between 20 and 32 teeth, all of which are set into the rostral part of the lower jaw. Unusually, adults lack enamel due to a mutation in the enamelysin gene, although enamel is present in very young individuals.

===Melon===
Like other toothed whales, the pygmy sperm whale has a &quot;melon&quot;, a body of fat and wax in the head that it uses to focus and modulate the sounds it makes. The inner core of the melon has a higher wax content than the outer cortex. The inner core transmits sound more slowly than the outer layer, allowing it to refract sound into a highly directional beam. Behind the melon, separated by a thin membrane, is the spermaceti organ. Both the melon and the spermaceti organ are encased in a thick fibrous coat, resembling a bursa. The whale produces sound by moving air through the right nasal cavity, which includes a valvular structure, or &quot;museau de singe&quot;, with a thickened vocal reed, functioning like the vocal cords of humans.

===Stomach===
The stomach has three chambers. The first chamber, or forestomach, is not glandular, and opens directly into the second, fundic chamber, which is lined by digestive glands. A narrow tube runs from the second to the third, or pyloric, stomach, which is also glandular, and connects, via a sphincter, to the duodenum. Although fermentation of food material apparently occurs in the small intestine, no caecum is present.

===Brain===
The rostroventral dura of the brain contains a significant concentration of magnetite crystals, which suggests that &quot;K. breviceps&quot; can navigate by magnetoreception.

Studies have also shown that compared to the sperm whale, the pygmy sperm whale brain has significantly fewer neurons, which may be connected to a decreased complexity in social interaction and group-based living.

==Echolocation==
Like all toothed whales, the pygmy sperm whale hunts prey by echolocation. Sound produced for echolocation by many odontocetes come in the form of high-frequency clicks. The frequencies it uses are mostly ultrasonic, peaking around 125 kHz. The clicks from their echolocation has been recorded to last an average of 600 microseconds. When closing in on prey, the click repetition rate starts at 20 Hz and then begins to rise when nearing the target.

The pulse sounds that pygmy sperm whales make for echolocation are generated primarily from the &quot;museau de singe&quot; or monkey&#x27;s muzzle, which is an anatomical structure located within the whale&#x27;s skull that produces sound when air passes through its lips. The sound from the &quot;museau de singe&quot; is transferred to the attached cone of the spermaceti organ. Unique from other odontocetes, the spermaceti organ contacts the posterior of the whale&#x27;s melon. Fat from the core of the spermaceti organ helps direct sonic energy from the &quot;museau de singe&quot; to the melon. The melon acts as a sonic magnifier and gives directionality to sound pulses, making echolocation more efficient. Fat on the interior of the melon has a lower molecular weight lipid than the surrounding outer melon. Since the sound waves move from a lower velocity material to a higher one during sound production, the sound undergoes inward refraction and becomes increasingly focused. Variation in fat density within the melon ultimately contributes to the production of highly directional, ultrasonic sound beams in front of the melon. The combined melon and spermaceti organ system cooperate to focus echolocative sounds.

Like in most odontocetes, the known echoreception apparatus used by the pygmy sperm whale is linked to the fat-filled lower mandibles within the skull. However, compositional topography of the pygmy sperm whale&#x27;s skull indicates abnormally large fatty jowls surrounding the mandibles, suggesting a more intricate echoreception apparatus. Additionally, an unusual cushion structure, of porous and spongy texture, found behind the &quot;museau de singe&quot; has been hypothesized of being a possible &quot;pressure receptor&quot;. The positioning of this cushion structure in close proximity to the largest cavities closest to the &quot;museau de singe&quot; may suggest that it is a sound absorber used for echoreception.

==Reproduction==

Although firm details concerning pygmy sperm whale reproduction are limited, they are believed to mate from April to September in the Southern Hemisphere and March to August in the Northern Hemisphere. These whales become sexually mature at age 4-5, and like virtually all mammals, are iteroparous (reproducing many times during their lives). Once a female whale is impregnated, the average gestation period lasts 9–11 months, and unusually for cetaceans, the female gives birth to a single calf head-first. Newborn calves are about in length, weighing 50 kg, and are weaned around one year of age. They are believed to live up to age 23.

==Behaviour==
The whale makes very inconspicuous movements. It rises to the surface slowly, with little splash or blow, and remains there motionless for some time. In Japan, the whale was historically known as the &quot;floating whale&quot; because of this. Its dive is equally lacking in grand flourish - it simply drops out of view. The species has a tendency to back away from rather than approach boats. Breaching has been observed, but is not common. 

Pygmy sperm whales are normally either solitary or found in pairs, but have been seen in groups up to six. Dives have been estimated to last an average of 11 minutes, although longer dives up to 45 minutes have been reported. The ultrasonic clicks of pygmy sperm whales range from 60 to 200 kHz, peaking at 125 kHz, and the animals also make much lower-frequency &quot;cries&quot; at 1 to 2 kHz.

===Diet/foraging behavior===
Analysis of stomach contents suggests that pygmy sperm whales feed primarily on cephalopods, most commonly including bioluminescent species found in midwater environments. Most of the cephalopod hunting is known to be pelagic, and fairly shallow, within the first 100 m of the surface. The most common prey are reported to include glass squid, and lycoteuthid and ommastrephid squid, although the whales also consume other squid, and octopuses. They have also been reported to eat some deep-sea shrimps, but, compared with dwarf sperm whales, relatively few fish.

Predators may include great white sharks and killer whales.

Pygmy sperm whales and dwarf sperm whales are unique among cetaceans in using a form of &quot;ink&quot; to evade predation in a manner similar to squid. Both species have a sac in the lower portion of their intestinal tracts that contains up to 12 liters of dark reddish-brown fluid, which can be ejected to confuse or discourage potential predators.

==Population and distribution==

Pygmy sperm whales are found throughout the tropical and temperate waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, and occasionally among colder waters such as off Russia. However, they are rarely sighted at sea, so most data come from stranded animals - making a precise range and migration map difficult. They are believed to prefer off-shore waters, and are most frequently sighted in waters ranging from in depth, especially where upwelling water produces local concentrations of zooplankton and animal prey. Their status is usually described as rare, but occasional patches of higher-density strandings suggest they might be more common than previously estimated. The total population is unknown.

Fossils identified as belonging to &quot;K. breviceps&quot; have been recovered from Miocene deposits in Italy, Japan, and southern Africa.

==Human interaction==
Pygmy sperm whales have never been hunted on a wide scale. Land-based whalers have hunted them from Indonesia, Japan, and the Lesser Antilles. This species was impacted by whaling in the 18th and 19th centuries, as sperm whales were especially sought after by whalers for their sperm oil, produced by the spermaceti organ. The oil was used to fuel kerosene lamps. Ambergris, a waste product produced by the whales, was also valuable to whalers as it was used by humans in cosmetics and perfume.

They were not as heavily hunted as their larger counterpart &quot;Physeter macrocephalus&quot;, the sperm whale, which are typically 120,000 lb, thus preferred by whalers. The pygmy sperm whale is also rather inactive and slow rising when coming to the surface and as such do not bring much attention to themselves. However, they were easy targets, as they tended to swim slowly and lie motionless at the surface.

Individuals have also been recorded killed in drift nets. Some stranded animals have been found with plastic bags in their stomachs, which may be a cause for concern. Whether these activities are causing long-term damage to the survival of the species is not known.

Pygmy sperm whales do not do well in captivity. The longest recorded survival in captivity is 21 months, and most captive individuals die within one month, mostly due to dehydration or dietary problems.

Pygmy sperm whales have been reported as being forced to change their diets and foraging behaviors due to anthropic factors such as deep-sea trawling and increased fishing for cephalopods off the coast of many Southeast Asian countries.

==Conservation==
In 1985, the International Whaling Commission ended sperm whaling.

The pygmy sperm whale is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS) and the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS). The species is further included in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MoU).

As not much is known about this species, as well as due to the whaling and conservation laws in place for marine mammals, it is listed as &quot;lower risk least concern&quot; in the IUCN Red list. However, it faces some modern day issues; it is one of the most common stranded species in Florida sound. Due to its slow-moving and quiet nature, the species is at a higher risk of boat strikes. Its small size also allows for it to become a byproduct of commercial fishing, caught in seine nets. Anthropogenic noise caused by military activity and shipping is another issue affecting this species, as it echolocates. Pygmy sperm whales have also repeatedly been found stranded with plastic in their stomachs.

<doc id="465810" wikidata="Q7015634" url="?curid=465810" title="New Zealand Scholarship">
<text>New Zealand Scholarship is a New Zealand secondary school award, awarded to a limited number of students, that provides financial support for study at a New Zealand university. It is awarded by assessing candidates against challenging standards through an examination or, in the case of some subjects, submission of a portfolio and/or report. Successful candidates have the potential to receive as much as $10,000 per year over three years depending on the class of award that they achieve. It is highly competitive as only 3% of the number of students studying a subject at NCEA Level 3 are able to achieve a passing grade on the scholarship assessment. New Zealand Scholarship is administered by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA), alongside the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA). It is sometimes referred to as NCEA Level 4, sitting at Level 4 on the New Zealand Qualifications Framework. 

In 2020, 10,433 students were entered into New Zealand Scholarship assessments. There were 20,095 individual subject entries. Only 13,110 of these were marked and graded as some were absent or void. 2,151 students received a Scholarship award of some form.

==History ==
The first scholarship examination by the University of New Zealand was held in May 1872. After 1962, scholarships were awarded by the Universities Entrance Board. The New Zealand Qualifications Authority took over the work of the Universities Entrance Board in 1991.

From 1989 to 2003 scholarships were awarded to the top 3-4% of Bursary students. In response to the removal of separate scholarship examinations a group of teachers set up their own scholarship exam, later becoming the New Zealand Educational Scholarships Trust (NZEST).

A &quot;NCEA Level 4&quot; qualification was proposed in the 1998 Cabinet paper &quot;Qualifications for Young People Aged 16 to 19 Years&quot; and the discussions that ensued concluded that there be an external examination and that scholarships be awarded. New Zealand Scholarship exams started in 2004. NZEST stopped its examinations and now provides financial assistance for students studying at NZ universities.

The 2004 examinations, in line with the NCEA, were criterion-referenced and produced some unexpected results distributions. Several reviews of the award and a media and political debate followed. The Scholarship examination was largely revamped. Scholarships in 2005 were awarded to the top three per cent of NCEA Level 3 candidates in the subject, given that examiners are satisfied a worthy standard has been met. Monetary awards were restructured and credit value was removed from the examinations.

==Award ==

The number of passing grades awarded in each scholarship subject is set at approximately 3% of the size of the Level 3 Cohort. The Level 3 Cohort is the number of students who achieve 14+ credits in the NCEA Level 3 equivalent of said subject. There are two types of passing grade, Scholarship (S) and Outstanding (O). A common misconception is that passing grades are only awarded to 3% of the students who sit the scholarship assessment, rather than 3% of the total Level 3 cohort. However, as evidenced by the ratio of entries to scholarship passes, the actual percentage of entries that pass is much higher than 3%. In 2020, for example, 37.2% of assessed entries received either an S or O passing grade in English, and 21% in Calculus. 

There are six classes of monetary award: 

*The Premier Award is awarded to the very top 7 to 12 Candidates. The minimum eligibility requirement to be considered for this award is achievement of at least three Scholarships at &quot;Outstanding&quot; level in the same year. The number of recipients for this award is restricted and achieving the minimum requirement will not guarantee an award. It is worth $10,000 each year for up to three years for as long as the recipient maintains at least a &#x27;B&#x27; grade average each year of their tertiary study.
*An Outstanding Scholar Award is awarded to the next top 40 to 60 candidates. The minimum eligibility requirement to be considered for this award is achievement of three Scholarships including at least two at &quot;Outstanding&quot; level in the same year, or more than three Scholarships including at least one at &quot;Outstanding&quot; level in the same year. The number of recipients for this award is restricted and achieving the minimum requirement will not guarantee an award. It is worth $5,000 each year for up to three years for as long as the recipient maintains at least a &#x27;B&#x27; grade average each year of their tertiary study.
*A Scholarship Award is awarded to candidates who achieve New Zealand Scholarship in three or more subjects in the same year and for Candidates who achieve two Scholarships at &quot;Outstanding&quot; level in the same year. It is worth $2,000 each year for up to three years for as long as the recipient maintains at least a &#x27;B&#x27; grade average each year of their tertiary study.
*A Top Subject Scholar Award is awarded to the top Candidate in each one of the New Zealand Scholarship subjects. It is worth $2,000 each year for up to three years for as long as the recipient maintains at least a &#x27;B&#x27; grade average each year of their tertiary study.
*A Single Subject Award is awarded to candidates who achieve New Zealand Scholarship in one or more subjects. It is a &#x27;one-off&#x27; award of $500 per subject, for up to two subjects, (maximum payment $1000). 
*The Prime Minister&#x27;s Award is awarded to the Candidate who has attained the best results of all Premier Award recipients, taking into account the number of New Zealand Scholarships achieved at &quot;Outstanding&quot; level, the number of additional New Zealand Scholarships achieved, and the ranking of Candidates within individual subjects.
Generally, students meeting the criteria for more than one award receive the award with the highest monetary value. However, students receiving a Top Subject Scholar Award, who also achieve Scholarship in another subject, also receive a Single Subject Award.

== Assessment ==
Scholarship subjects are assessed through a written exam lasting three hours, with some exceptions. Dance, Design, Design and Visual Communication, Music, Painting, Photography, Printmaking, and Sculpture are instead assessed through submission of portfolios of work. Health &amp; Physical Education and Technology are instead assessed through submitted reports. Assessments for language subjects also involve recorded speaking; the same is true for Dance, Drama, and Music but with a recorded performance.

To be able to enter New Zealand Scholarship, students only have to be enrolled in a consented New Zealand secondary school. This means that, while it is usually Year 13 students who enter, some Year 12 students undertake Scholarship as well. Sometimes, Year 11 students also enter.

<doc id="465816" wikidata="Q721639" url="?curid=465816" title="Flag carrier">
<text>A flag carrier is a transport company, such as an airline or shipping company, that, being locally registered in a given sovereign state, enjoys preferential rights or privileges accorded by that government for international operations. 

Historically, the term was used to refer to airlines owned by the government of their home country and associated with the national identity of that country. Such an airline may also be known as a national airline or a national carrier, although this can have different legal meanings in some countries. Today, it is any international airline with a strong connection to its home country or that represents its home country internationally, regardless of whether it is government-owned.

Flag carriers may also be known as such due to laws requiring aircraft or ships to display the state flag of the country of their registry. For example, under the law of the United States, a U.S. flag air carrier is any airline that holds a certificate under Section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (i.e., any U.S.-based airline operating internationally),and any ship registered in the United States is known as a U.S. flag vessel.

==Background==

The term &quot;flag carrier&quot; is a legacy of the early days of commercial aviation when governments often took the lead by establishing state-owned airlines because of the high capital costs of running them. However, not all such airlines were government-owned; Pan Am, TWA, Cathay Pacific, Union de Transports Aériens, Canadian Pacific Air Lines and Olympic Airlines were all privately owned, but were considered to be flag carriers as they were the &quot;main national airline&quot; and often a sign of their country&#x27;s presence abroad.

The heavily regulated aviation industry also meant aviation rights are often negotiated between governments, denying airlines access to an open market. These Bilateral Air Transport Agreements similar to the Bermuda I and Bermuda II agreements specify rights awardable only to locally registered airlines, forcing some governments to jump-start airlines to avoid being disadvantaged in the face of foreign competition. Some countries also establish flag carriers such as Israel&#x27;s El Al or Lebanon&#x27;s Middle East Airlines for nationalist reasons or to aid the country&#x27;s economy, particularly in the area of tourism.

In many cases, governments would directly assist in the growth of their flag carriers typically through subsidies and other fiscal incentives. The establishment of competitors in the form of other locally registered airlines may be prohibited or heavily regulated to avoid direct competition. Even where privately run airlines may be allowed to be established, the flag carriers may still be accorded priority, especially in the apportionment of aviation rights to local or international markets.

Near the end of the 20th century, many of these airlines have been corporatized as a public company or a state-owned enterprise, while others have been completely privatized. The aviation industry has also been gradually deregulated and liberalized, permitting greater freedoms of the air particularly in the United States and in the European Union with the signing of the Open Skies agreement. One of the features of such agreements is the right of a country to designate multiple airlines to serve international routes with the result that there is no single &quot;flag carrier&quot;.

<doc id="465820" wikidata="Q3702706" url="?curid=465820" title="Dark Avenger">
<text>Dark Avenger was the pseudonym of a computer virus writer from Sofia, Bulgaria. He gained considerable notoriety during the early 1990s when his viruses spread internationally.

== Background and origins ==
During the Cold War, the Bulgarian government authorized projects to reverse engineer Western technology. This eventually led to the Pravetz computers of the 1980s, which cloned popular Western personal computers. A community formed around these computers when they were used in schools to teach students computer programming. In April 1988, Bulgaria&#x27;s trade magazine for computers, &quot;Компютър за Вас&quot; (&quot;Computer for You&quot;), published a translation of a German article about computer viruses and methods for writing them. A few months after that, Bulgaria experienced several foreign viruses. The interest spawned by both the article and the viruses inspired young Bulgarian programmers to devise their own viruses. Soon a wave of Bulgarian viruses erupted, started by the &quot;Old Yankee&quot; and &quot;Vacsina&quot; viruses. Dark Avenger made his first appearance in the spring of 1989. At the time, Bulgaria did not have any laws against writing computer viruses. Anti-virus researchers identified Bulgaria as having talented programmers who had few commercial opportunities, and Bulgarian security researcher Vesselin Bontchev blamed the viruses on the country&#x27;s history of pirating Western computer code and failure to teach students about computer ethics.

== Viruses ==
Dark Avenger&#x27;s first virus appeared in early 1989 and contained the string, &quot;This program was written in the city of Sofia (C) 1988–89 Dark Avenger&quot;. Thus, this first virus is usually referred to as &quot;Dark Avenger&quot;, eponymous to its author. Dark Avenger&#x27;s viruses made frequent references to heavy metal bands, including Iron Maiden, and Diana, Princess of Wales. His pseudonym is based on a Manowar song.

The virus was very infectious: if the virus was active in memory, opening or just copying an executable file was sufficient to infect it. Additionally, the virus also destroyed data, by overwriting a random sector of the disk at every 16th run of an infected program, progressively corrupting files and directories on the disk. Corrupted files contained the string, &quot;Eddie lives... somewhere in time!&quot;, a reference to Iron Maiden. Due to its highly infectious nature, the virus spread worldwide, reaching Western Europe, the USSR, the United States, and East Asia.

Dutch author Harry Mulisch reported encountering the virus on his laptop while writing &quot;The Discovery of Heaven&quot;. Mulisch considered it a &quot;favourable sign from higher powers&quot; and briefly considered naming his son Eduard after the virus&#x27; output. A few weeks later, he re-encountered the virus and had it professionally removed.

This virus was soon followed by others, each employing a new trick. Dark Avenger is believed to have authored the following viruses: Dark Avenger, V2000 (two variants), V2100 (two variants), 651, Diamond (two variants), Nomenklatura, 512 (six variants), 800, 1226, Proud, Evil, Phoenix, Anthrax, and Leech. As a major means for spreading the source code of his viruses, Dark Avenger used the then popular bulletin board systems.
In its variants, the virus also contained the following strings:
* &quot;Zopy (sic) me – I want to travel&quot;
* &quot;Only the Good die young...&quot;
* &quot;Copyright (C) 1989 by Vesselin Bontchev&quot;

In technical terms, the most prominent feature of some of Dark Avenger&#x27;s viruses was their Mutation Engine (MtE). This allowed the viruses to change their signature, preventing them from being easily recognized by anti-virus programs. Following its release, Paul Mungo and Bryan Clough called MtE &quot;the most dangerous virus ever produced&quot;, and Steve Gibson wrote that &quot;the game is forever changed&quot;.

== Identity ==
The identity of the person behind the pseudonym has never been ascertained. In 1992, Dark Avenger described himself as a heavy metal fan under 30 who wrote viruses while procrastinating at his job. Sarah Gordon, a computer security researcher, publicly requested that a virus be named after her. When this request was granted, she used this as an opening to make contact with Dark Avenger. She later published their communications in interview format. Analysis by the researchers Andrew Bissett and Geraldine Shipton concluded that Dark Avenger engaged in victim blaming; he blamed &quot;human stupidity&quot; for the transmission of his viruses and denied that any data of value would be lost on personal computers. They cited his envy of wealthy Westerners&#x27; computers as his motivation for making viruses; Gordon herself attributed his motivation to a hatred of Bontchev. Dark Avenger made frequent attacks on Bontchev. Such is the case with the viruses V2000 and V2100, which claim to have been written by Bontchev, to defame him. This conflict between the two has led some to believe that Bontchev and Dark Avenger were promoting each other or that they might be the same person. Bontchev denied this and claimed in 1993 to have deduced Dark Avenger&#x27;s identity. He said that because writing viruses was not illegal, there was no point in pursuing it.

Dark Avenger&#x27;s profile was raised substantially by a 1997 story in &quot;Wired&quot;, in which the journalist David S. Bennahum attempted to track down Dark Avenger. Bennahum did not uncover Dark Avenger&#x27;s identity but came to suspect the operator of a Bulgarian bulletin board system that collected computer viruses in the 1990s. Neither he nor someone who claimed to be Dark Avenger would say whether this was true.

<doc id="465821" wikidata="Q42669" url="?curid=465821" title="Dwarf sperm whale">
<text>The dwarf sperm whale (Kogia sima) is a sperm whale that inhabits temperate and tropical oceans worldwide, in particular continental shelves and slopes. It was first described by biologist Richard Owen in 1866, based on illustrations by naturalist Sir Walter Elliot. The species was considered to be synonymous with the pygmy sperm whale (&quot;Kogia breviceps&quot;) from 1878 until 1998. The dwarf sperm whale is a small whale, and , that has a grey coloration, square head, small jaw, and robust body. Its appearance is very similar to the pygmy sperm whale, distinguished mainly by the position of the dorsal fin on the body–nearer the middle in the dwarf sperm whale and nearer the tail in the other.

The dwarf sperm whale is a suction feeder that mainly eats squid, and does this in small pods of typically one to four members. It is preyed upon by the killer whale (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;) and large sharks such as the great white shark (&quot;Carcharodon carcharius&quot;). When startled, the whale can eject a cloud of red-brown fluid. Most of what is known of the whale comes from beached individuals, as sightings in the ocean are rare. Many of these stranded whales died from parasitic infestations or heart failure.

The dwarf sperm whale is hunted in small numbers around Asia. It is most threatened by ingesting, or getting entangled by marine debris. No global population estimate has been made, and so its conservation status by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is least concern.

==Taxonomy==

The first two dwarf sperm whale specimens, a male and a female, were collected in 1853 by naturalist Sir Walter Elliot, who thought it a kind of porpoise due to the short snout. However, when he sent drawings of these whales – including skeletal diagrams – to biologist Richard Owen to describe, Owen, in his 1866 paper, recognized it as a type of sperm whale in the family Physeteridae based on several similar characteristics, such as having functional teeth in only the lower jaw, a lopsided blowhole leaning towards the left side, and a spermaceti organ. He named it &quot;Physeter (Euphysetes) simus&quot;, the same genus as the sperm whale (&quot;Physeter macrocephalus&quot;) and the pygmy sperm whale (now &quot;Kogia breviceps&quot;), with &quot;Euphysetes&quot; acting as a subgenus. The species name &quot;simus&quot; is Latin for &quot;stump-nosed&quot;, a reference to its blunt snout. John Edward Gray, when he created the genus &quot;Kogia&quot; in 1846, gave no indication to the meaning, but, since the word has a feminine ending, the masculine species name &quot;simus&quot; had to be changed to &quot;sima&quot; to fit this when the combination &quot;Kogia simus&quot; was proposed by various 20th century authors. In 1900, zoologist Frank Evers Beddard speculated that the word &quot;might be a tribute to a Turk of the past surnamed Cogia Effendi, who observed whales in the Mediterranean&quot;.

In 1871, mammalogist Theodore Gill split Physeteridae into two subfamilies: Physterinae with &quot;Physeter&quot;, and Kogiinae with &quot;Kogia&quot; and the now-defunct &quot;Euphysetes&quot;; this has now been elevated to family, Kogiidae. Gill also proposed the dwarf sperm whale be moved to its own genus, &quot;Calignathus&quot;. In 1878, naturalist James Hector synonymized the dwarf sperm whale with the pygmy sperm whales as &quot;K. breviceps&quot;. No distinction was made by most authors until mammalogist Dale Rice in his 1998 review of marine mammal taxonomy citing the works of Dr. Teizo Ogawa from 1936, researcher Munesato Yamada from 1954, zoologist Charles Handley from 1966, and mammalogist Graham James Berry Ross from 1979.

Genetic testing in 2006 suggests that &quot;K. sima&quot; may actually represent two species, one in the Atlantic and one in the Indo-Pacific region. The Cape of Good Hope around South Africa may mark the barrier between these two populations.

==Description==

The dwarf sperm whale can range in size from in length and in weight—less than the and pygmy sperm whale. A newborn is generally around long and . Males are thought to reach physical maturity at age 15, and females at age 13. Sexual maturity, which happens after an individual has attained in length, happens at 2 to 3 years for males and around 5 for females. Gestation takes place probably over around 9.5 months.

The dwarf sperm whale has a dark-grey or blue-grey coloration with a lighter-grey underside, and a pale, crescent-shaped mark between the eye and the flipper, sometimes called a &quot;fake gill&quot;, which is characteristic of the genus. Some individuals have been known to have a second crescent-shaped mark, creating a sort of pale ring encircling a darker spot. It has a high dorsal fin halfway down the length of the body, and two or more throat grooves. The dorsal fin is taller and closer to the head than it is in the pygmy sperm whale, and the back is flatter.
&quot;Kogia&quot; is identified as having a square head, a small jaw with the snout jutting outward, and a porpoise-like build with a robust body that rapidly decreases towards the tail. They have the shortest snouts of any modern day whale. Characteristic of sperm whales, the left nostril is markedly larger than the right, and it has a spermaceti organ on its skull. The brain weighs around . The eyes are adapted for low-light environments. The dwarf sperm whale has 14 to 24 teeth, rarely 26, in the lower jaw that are sharp, slightly curved backwards, and–like other sperm whales–lack enamel. The teeth rarely exceed in length, smaller than those of the pygmy sperm whale. At most, 6 teeth are in the upper jaws, though in modern sperm whales, upper teeth are defunct.

Unique to &quot;Kogia&quot;, there is a sac which hangs off from the small intestines near the anus that is filled with a dense, red-brown fluid that looks similar to chocolate syrup. When stressed, this fluid is released. The dwarf sperm whale has between 50 and 57 vertebrae, 7 neck vertebrae, 12 to 14 thoracic vertebrae, and 29 or 35-to-37 lumbar vertebrae. The variation can either be due to loss of bones during preparation of a specimen, or individual variations. It is not known to be sexually dimorphic.

==Population and distribution==
The dwarf sperm whale ranges throughout tropical and temperate oceans of the world and inhabits the continental shelf and slope area. It seems to prefer warmer waters than the pygmy sperm whale. The dwarf sperm whale is one of the most commonly beached deep-diving whales in the world, though rarely seen at sea, and likewise, most information about the whale comes from examining beached individuals. Diving depth may vary from place to place: a study in the Bahamas placed average depth at around , whereas a study in the deeper waters of Hawaii placed it at around .

In the West Pacific, its recorded range spans from Japan to Tasmania and New Zealand, and in the East Pacific from British Columbia to central Chile. In the Indian Ocean, the whale is reported from Oman, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia around Timor, western Australia and South Africa. In the West Atlantic, it has been recorded from Virginia to southern Brazil, and in the East Atlantic from Italy in the Mediterranean Sea to South Africa.

No global population estimation has been made. Population counts have been taken over certain areas, though given the difficulty to distinguish the dwarf sperm whale from the pygmy sperm whale, the overall estimate represents the total number of both species. In the North Atlantic, they are estimated at around 3,785 individuals; in the East Pacific, around 11,200 individuals.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
The dwarf sperm whale is an open ocean predator. The stomach contents of stranded dwarf sperm whales comprise mainly squid and, to a lesser degree, deep sea fish (from the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones) and crustaceans. However, crustaceans make up a sizable part of the diets of Hawaiian dwarf sperm whales, up to 15%. The stomach contents of whales washed up in different regions of the world indicate a preference for cock-eyed squid and glass squid across its range, particularly the elongate jewel squid (&quot;Histioteuthis reversa&quot;) and &quot;Taonius&quot;.

The throat grooves and the developed musculature in the throat in &quot;Kogia&quot; are probably adaptations for increasing the volume of the mouth for suction feeding, possibly the best-developed among toothed whales. Also, the blunt snout, lack of teeth, and reduced jaw are characteristics seen in other suction feeding toothed whales. The whale uses its sharp teeth to hold onto prey while expelling water from the mouth.

Dwarf sperm whale calves typically start eating solid food once they have reached a size of around though are not fully weaned until they reach around . Toothed whale calves generally start eating solid food at around 6 months, and mothers stop lactating after around 18 to 20 months.

===Threats===
Killer whales (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;) and sharks are known to prey on the dwarf sperm whale. Dwarf sperm whale remains have been found in the stomachs of great white sharks (&quot;Carcharodon carcharias&quot;), and infestations of the cestode &quot;Phyllobothrium delphini&quot; in beached individuals indicates shark attacks since the cestode matures in sharks.

The dwarf sperm whale also competes with other squid-eating whales, such as beaked whales. It occupies the same ecological niche in the same regions as the pygmy sperm whale, though the latter can forage in deeper waters and has been known to feed on a wider array of species of larger size.

Some beached individuals have had large parasitic infestations which probably lead to their death, particular with nematodes in the stomach and tapeworms in the blubber. In the southeastern United States, stranded dwarf sperm whales were found to have died from heart failure, and heart failure may have led to the stranding itself.

Although Dwarf sperm whales swim in the deep waters far from the shore, they still possess some important escaping mechanisms. “If a Dwarf sperm whale is frightened, it may secrete a red liquid. This causes a cloud to form that stops or distracts predators. This allows the whale to dive deep into the ocean and escape” (Petrie, 2005). Even though Dwarf sperm whales were believed to be in the deep ocean, they have recently been surfacing at the top, putting them in danger by humans. In Japan’s southern coast and Indonesia a small amount of Dwarf sperm whales are being accidentally captured in fishing nets and sold at fish markets. “They are also being put at health risk due to human pollution, ingestion of marine debris, and potential ship strikes” (Reed et al., 2015).
==Behavior==

&quot;Kogia&quot; is thought to be slow-moving, rarely displaying rapid surfacing behavior, tending to float at the surface with only the nape and dorsal fin exposed. From the surface, they sink vertically, instead of lifting their tails out of the water to dive, which would create a splash.

The dwarf sperm whale congregates into small pods of one to four individuals, though on occasion up to ten, likely due to limited food resources. Small group size and deep foraging grounds in the summer could also be anti-predator behaviors. However, this is less likely as dolphins congregate in large pods with hundreds of members to prevent predation. The whale probably follows seasonal squid migrations from offshore in the summer to nearshore in the winter. It is possible it prefers a slope habitat as it allows the whale to herd squid against the wall, or it causes upwelling which the whale can ride on in order to save energy while hunting. Younger animals may congregate in shallower areas and adults in deeper areas; the slope around South Africa may be a nursery grounds.

&quot;Kogia&quot;, unlike other whales, can eject a red-brown fluid when startled, likely to distract predators, similar to squid. This cloud can cover in the water.

This species does not whistle, and instead produces narrowband high-frequency clicks. These clicks are more similar to those produced by some dolphin and porpoise species–such as the hourglass dolphin (&quot;Sagmatias cruciger&quot;), Hector&#x27;s dolphin (&quot;Cephalorhynchus hectori&quot;), the Chilean dolphin (&quot;Cephalorhynchus eutropia&quot;), Commerson&#x27;s dolphin (&quot;Cephalorhynchus commersonii&quot;), the harbour porpoise (&quot;Phocoena phocoena&quot;), and Dall&#x27;s porpoise (&quot;Phocoenoides dalli&quot;)–than to those of other deep-diving whales, such as beaked whales and the sperm whale. The peak frequencies of &quot;Kogia&quot; are generally less than 130 kHz.

==Relationship with humans==
There is some hunting of the dwarf sperm whale in Indonesia, Japan, Sri Lanka, and the Lesser Antilles as food or bait, though there are no major operations. A bigger threat is likely ingestion of marine debris and entanglement in fishing gear, though it has not been determined how serious a threat these pose. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) currently lists the dwarf sperm whale&#x27;s conservation status as data deficient, though it could possibly be of least concern.

The dwarf sperm whale is covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area. The species is further included in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU), and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MoU).

Founded in 1978 by Pakistan&#x27;s Air Marshal Nur Khan and the Pakistan Hockey Federation, it featured the world&#x27;s top-ranked field hockey teams competing in a round robin format. A biennial women&#x27;s tournament was added in 1987. The Champions Trophy was changed from an annual to a biennial event from 2014 onwards, due to the introduction of the Hockey World League (HWL). The 2018 edition was the last edition of the Champions Trophy and the tournament was replaced by the Men&#x27;s FIH Pro League and the Women&#x27;s FIH Pro League in 2019.

In the men&#x27;s tournament, Australia won the tournament fifteen times, Germany ten and the Netherlands eight times. Pakistan is the only Asian champion, with three titles to its name including the first two in 1978 and 1980. In the women&#x27;s tournament, Argentina and the Netherlands won the trophy seven times each. Australia have won the trophy six times, while Germany, China and South Korea have won it one time each.

Since the 2011 edition, eight teams of each six have qualified for the championship. The first edition had five teams, the second had seven, 1987 had eight, and all other editions through 2010 had six. In the year following the Olympics or a World Cup, the participating teams include the host, the defending champion, the world champion and the next highest ranked teams from either the most recent World Cup or Olympic Games.

<doc id="465838" wikidata="Q1281212" url="?curid=465838" title="Moe Howard">
<text>Moses Harry Horwitz (June 19, 1897 – May 4, 1975), better known by his stage name Moe Howard, was an American comedian and actor. He is best known as the leader and straight man of the Three Stooges, the farce comedy team who starred in motion pictures and television for four decades. That group initially started out as Ted Healy and His Stooges, an act that toured the vaudeville circuit. Moe&#x27;s distinctive hairstyle came about when he was a boy and cut off his curls with a pair of scissors, producing an irregular shape approximating a bowl cut.

==Early life==
Howard was born as Moses Harry Horwitz on June 19, 1897, in the Brooklyn, New York neighborhood of Bensonhurst, the fourth of five sons of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants Jennie ( Gorovitz) and Solomon Horwitz. He was called Moe as a child and later called himself Harry. His parents and brothers Benjamin (&quot;Jack&quot;) and Isidore (Irving) were not involved in show business. However he, his older brother Samuel (Shemp), and his younger brother Jerome (Curly) eventually became known as members of The Three Stooges. He loved to read, as his older brother Jack recalled: &quot;I had many Horatio Alger books, and it was Moe&#x27;s greatest pleasure to read them. They started his imaginative mind working and gave him ideas by the dozen. I think they were instrumental in putting thoughts into his head to become a person of good character and successful.&quot; This helped him in his acting career; he could memorize his lines quickly and easily.

Howard&#x27;s &quot;bowl cut&quot; hairstyle became his trademark, despite his mother initially refusing to cut his hair in childhood, letting it grow to shoulder length. He secretly cut his hair in his backyard shed after being frequently teased in school. During one appearance on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; in the 1970s, he stated, &quot;I used to fight my way to school, in school, and back home from school.&quot;

Howard developed an interest in acting causing his grades to worsen and spurred him to play hookey from school: &quot;I used to stand outside the theater knowing the truant officer was looking for me. I would stand there &#x27;til someone came along and ask them to buy my ticket. An adult needed to accompany a juvenile into the theater. When I succeeded, I&#x27;d give him my ten cents—that&#x27;s all it cost—and I&#x27;d go up to the top of the balcony where I&#x27;d put my chin on the rail and watch, spellbound, from the first act to the last. I would usually select the actor I liked the most and follow his performance throughout the play.&quot;

Despite his waning attendance, Howard graduated from P.S. 163 in Brooklyn but dropped out of Erasmus Hall High School after only two months, ending his formal education. He took an electric shop course to please his parents but quit after a few months to pursue a career in show business.

Howard started off running unpaid errands at the Vitagraph Studios in Midwood, Brooklyn and was rewarded with bit parts in movies in production there, until a 1910 fire destroyed the films done there, and with it, most of Howard&#x27;s work. Already in 1909, he had met a young man named Ernest Lea Nash (later known as Ted Healy), who was later to provide a significant boost for his career aspirations. In 1912, they both held a summer job working in Annette Kellermann&#x27;s aquatic act as diving &quot;girls&quot;.

==Career==
Howard continued his attempts at gaining show-business experience by singing in a bar with his older brother Shemp, until their father put a stop to it. Starting in 1914, they performed with a minstrel show troupe on a Mississippi River showboat for two summers, presenting an act they called &quot;Howard and Howard—A Study in Black&quot;. At the same time, they worked for a rival vaudeville circuit without makeup.

In 1922, Howard joined Ted Healy in a vaudeville routine. In 1923, Moe saw Shemp in the audience during a theater performance and yelled at him from the stage. Shemp responded by heckling Moe, and the two brothers&#x27; amusing bickering during the performance resulted in Healy&#x27;s immediately hiring Shemp as a permanent part of the act.

Moe retired in June 1925 after his marriage to Helen Schonberger and went into real estate with his mother. Meanwhile, Healy&#x27;s act with frequent stooge Shemp Howard went on to national fame in the Shubert Brothers&#x27; &quot;A Night in Spain&quot;, which had a successful Broadway run, as well as a national tour. During &quot;A Night in Spain&quot;, and at the end of a four-month run in Chicago, Healy recruited vaudeville violinist Larry Fine to join the troupe in March 1928.

After the show ended in late November, Healy signed for the Shuberts&#x27; new revue &quot;A Night in Venice&quot; and coaxed Moe Howard out of retirement to rejoin the act in December 1928. In rehearsals in early 1929, Howard, Larry Fine, and Shemp Howard came together for the first time as a trio. When &quot;A Night in Venice&quot; closed in March 1930, Healy and the trio toured for a while as &quot;Ted Healy and His Racketeers&quot; (later changed to Ted Healy and His Stooges).

===Ted Healy and His Stooges===

Ted Healy and His Stooges were on the verge of hitting the big time and made their first movie, &quot;Soup to Nuts&quot; (1930), featuring Healy and his four Stooges: Moe (billed as &quot;Harry Howard&quot;), Shemp, Larry, and Fred Sanborn (Sanborn had been with Healy&#x27;s troupe since January 1929, as one of the stooges in &quot;A Night in Venice&quot;)—for Fox Films (later 20th Century Fox). A disagreement with Healy led Moe, Larry, and Shemp to strike out on their own as &quot;Howard, Fine, and Howard,&quot; and on August 28, 1930, they premiered that act at L.A.&#x27;s Paramount Theatre. Joining the RKO vaudeville circuit, they toured for almost two years, eventually dubbing themselves as &quot;Three Lost Souls&quot; and taking on Jack Walsh as their straight man.

In July 1932, Moe, Larry, and Shemp were approached by Healy to rejoin him for the new Shubert Broadway revue &quot;Passing Show of 1932&quot;, and the three accepted the offer. On August 16, 1932, during &quot;Passing&quot; rehearsals in New York, Ted walked out on the Shuberts over a contract dispute. On August 19, 1932, Shemp gave his notice, having not seen eye-to-eye with the hard-drinking and sometimes belligerent Healy, and decided to remain with &quot;Passing&quot;. That show closed in September after bad reviews of its first roadshow performances in Detroit and Cincinnati. Shemp landed at Vitaphone Studios in Brooklyn in May 1933, where he stayed for almost four years.

On August 20, the day after Shemp&#x27;s departure, Moe suggested adding his youngest brother Jerome (&quot;Babe&quot; to Moe and Shemp) to the act; contrary to some sources, no search for a replacement was conducted. Healy initially passed on Jerry, but Jerry was so eager to join the act that he shaved off his luxuriant auburn mustache and hair and ran on stage during Healy&#x27;s routine. That finally got Healy to hire Jerry, who took the stage name Curly. The new lineup of Moe, Larry, and Curly premiered with Ted on stage at Cleveland&#x27;s RKO Palace on August 27, 1932. Early in 1933 during appearances in Los Angeles, Healy and the Stooges were hired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as &quot;nut&quot; comics to liven up feature films and short subjects with their antics.

===The Three Stooges===
After several appearances in several MGM films, Healy was being groomed as a solo character comedian. In 1934, his Stooges, then named The Three Stooges, signed with Columbia Pictures, where they stayed until December 1957, making 190 comedy shorts.

With Healy&#x27;s departure, Moe assumed Healy&#x27;s prior role as the aggressive, take-charge leader of the team: a short-tempered bully, prone to slapstick violence against the other two Stooges. Despite his outwardly rather cruel demeanor towards his pals, Moe was also very loyal and protective of the other Stooges on film, keeping them from harm, and, should it befall them, doing whatever it took to save them.

He emphasized in his autobiography that the ill-tempered aspects of his on-screen persona did not reflect his real personality. He also boasted of being a shrewd businessman by wisely investing the money made from his film career. Still, the Stooges received no subsequent royalties (i.e., residuals) from any of their many shorts; they were paid a flat amount for each one, and Columbia owned the rights (and profits) thereafter. However, according to Larry Fine, in the 1970s, Columbia allowed the Stooges to do live tours when they were not filming in exchange for a half-salary during those months. Fine indicated that the profits from the tours substantially increased their yearly take.

Columbia released its first Three Stooges short, &quot;Woman Haters&quot; (1934), where their stooge characters were not quite fully formed. It was not a Stooge comedy in the classic sense, but rather a musical romantic farce; Columbia was then making a series of two-reel &quot;Musical Novelties&quot; with the dialogue delivered in rhyme, and the Stooges were recruited to support comedian Marjorie White. Only after the Stooges became established as short-subject stars, the main titles changed to give the Stooges top billing. The version seen on TV and video today is this reissue print.

Their next film, &quot;Punch Drunks&quot; (1934), was the only short film written entirely by the Three Stooges, with Curly as a reluctant boxer who goes ballistic every time he hears &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot;. Their next short, &quot;Men in Black&quot; (also 1934), a parody of the contemporary hospital drama &quot;Men in White&quot;, was their first and only film to be nominated for an Academy Award (with the classic catchphrases &quot;Calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard&quot; followed by their reiterated unison declaration as young doctors, &quot;For Duty and Humanity!!&quot;). They continued making short films at a steady pace of eight per year, such as &quot;Three Little Pigskins&quot; (also 1934) with a young Lucille Ball, &quot;Pop Goes the Easel&quot; (1935), and &quot;Hoi Polloi&quot; (also 1935), in which two professors make a bet trying to turn the Three Stooges into gentlemen.

====1940s====

In the 1940s, the Three Stooges became topical, making several anti-Nazi short films, including &quot;You Nazty Spy!&quot; (1940) Moe&#x27;s favorite Three Stooges film, &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Heil Again&quot; (1941), and &quot;They Stooge to Conga&quot; (1943). Moe&#x27;s impersonation of Adolf Hitler highlighted these shorts, the first of which preceded Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s film satire &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; by nine months.

On May 6, 1946, during the filming of &quot;Half-Wits Holiday&quot; (1947), brother Curly suffered a stroke. He had already suffered a series of them before the filming of &quot;Beer Barrel Polecats&quot; (1946) and was replaced by Shemp, who agreed to return to the group, but only until Curly would be well enough to rejoin. However, Curly appeared in &quot;Hold That Lion!&quot; (1947) in a cameo (the only Three Stooges film to contain all three Howard brothers: Moe, Curly, and Shemp), it was an impromptu setup. He was well enough to participate in a second cameo the next year as a chef in a short scene in &quot;Malice in the Palace&quot;, but the footage was never used. Curly suffered a second series of strokes which led to his death at age 48 on January 18, 1952.

After Shemp rejoined the act, Moe, Shemp, and Larry shot a television pilot for ABC called &quot;Jerks of All Trades&quot; (1949), apparently intended to lead to a weekly sitcom series on the premise that the Stooges would try a different job or business every week, hoping that eventually one of their attempts would be successful. Anything they tried turned out to be a fiasco, which was the source of the comedy. The pilot took a single day to film and was never aired. It was a kinescope film of three-camera television production, most likely to replicate a proposed live broadcast.

B.B. Kahane, Columbia Pictures&#x27; vice president of business affairs, stopped the show from being broadcast. Kahane warned the Stooges that a contract stipulation restricted them from performing in a TV series that might compete with their two-reel comedies. Columbia threatened to cancel the boys&#x27; contract and take them to court if they tried to sell the series. To avert a legal hassle, the pilot was shelved and the project abandoned. The kinescope film is now in the public domain and widely available. However, Columbia did allow The Stooges to make guest appearances on various TV variety shows.

====1950s====
The Three Stooges&#x27; series of shorts continued to be popular through the 1950s; Shemp co-starred in 73 comedies. The Stooges also co-starred in a George O&#x27;Brien Western, &quot;Gold Raiders&quot; (1951). Moe also co-produced occasional Western and musical films in the 1950s.

On November 22, 1955, Shemp died of a heart attack at age 60, necessitating another Stooge. Producer Jules White used old footage of Shemp to complete four more films, with Columbia regular Joe Palma filling in for Shemp (thus creating the Fake Shemp phenomenon), until Columbia head Harry Cohn hired Joe Besser in 1956. According to Moe&#x27;s autobiography, Howard wanted a &quot;two-stooge&quot; act, and Cohn&#x27;s idea, not Howard&#x27;s, was to replace Shemp as part of the act.

The Stooges replaced Shemp with Besser; already an established Columbia comedy shorts star in his own right and frequent movie supporting player. Joe, Larry, and Moe filmed 16 shorts through December 1957. Shortly before Cohn&#x27;s death in February 1958, the making of short subjects ended. Keeping himself busy, Moe was hired by Harry Romm as associate producer. According to Moe, stories (and later, scenes in a 2000 made-for-TV biopic) that he was forced to take a job as a gofer at Columbia are entirely false.

===Television and advent of Curly Joe===
Columbia sold the Three Stooges&#x27; library of short films to television under the Screen Gems name. With this, the Three Stooges quickly gained a new audience of young fans. Ever the businessman, Moe Howard put together a new Stooges act, with burlesque and screen comic Joe DeRita (dubbed &quot;Curly-Joe&quot; because of his vague resemblance to Moe&#x27;s late younger brother Curly Howard and to differentiate him from Joe Besser) as the new &quot;third Stooge&quot;. DeRita, like Shemp Howard and Joe Besser, had starred in a series of his comedy shorts. Several local television children&#x27;s shows around the country began running the Stooges films, among them Paul Shannon, host of Adventure Time at WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh and Sally Starr at WFIL-TV (now WPVI-TV) in Philadelphia. The films were so popular some young fans tried to emulate Moe&#x27;s slapping, gouging, and hitting, prompting the Stooges to warn them against trying to re-create those actions.

The revitalized trio starred in six feature-length movies: &quot;Have Rocket, Will Travel&quot; (1959); &quot;Snow White and the Three Stooges&quot; (1961), &quot;The Three Stooges Meet Hercules&quot; and &quot;The Three Stooges in Orbit&quot; (1962), &quot;The Three Stooges Go Around the World in a Daze&quot; (1963), and &quot;The Outlaws Is Coming&quot; (1965).

Howard, Larry, and Curly-Joe continued to make live appearances, many notable &quot;guest appearances&quot;, particularly in &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963) as three firemen who appear for only a few seconds, and a longer appearance in &quot;4 for Texas&quot; (also 1963) starring Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. The men tried their hand at a children&#x27;s cartoon show titled &quot;The New Three Stooges&quot;, with the cartoons sandwiched between live-action segments of the Stooges filmed in color.

During this period, Moe and the Stooges appeared on numerous television shows, including &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Masquerade Party&quot;, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;Danny Thomas Meets the Comics&quot;, &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;, &quot;Off to See the Wizard&quot;, and &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; but, by the late 1960s, they were all at an age where they could no longer risk serious injury while performing slapstick comedy.

===Later years===
The men were paid residuals for their later efforts and continued to receive the bulk of the profits from sales of Stooges merchandise. Moe sold real estate when his show-business life slowed down. However, he still did minor solo roles and walk-on bits in movies, such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry, We&#x27;ll Think of a Title&quot; (1966) and &quot;Doctor Death: Seeker of Souls&quot; (1973), as well as several appearances on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; in the 1970s.

In one of Douglas&#x27;s episodes, Moe, his hair in a style popular at the time, made a surprise appearance during an interview with the writer of a &quot;where-are-they-now&quot; book. When the audience was given a chance to ask the writer about famous people, Howard asked, &quot;Whatever happened to the Three Stooges?&quot; Finally recognized by Douglas, he combed his hair into his trademark style.

The Stooges attempted to make a final film in 1969, &quot;Kook&#x27;s Tour&quot;, which was essentially a documentary of Howard, Larry, and Curly Joe out of character, touring the US, and meeting with fans. Production halted when on January 9, 1970, Larry suffered a major stroke during filming, paralyzing the left side of his body. He died on January 24, 1975, at age 72. Enough footage of Larry was shot so that &quot;Kook&#x27;s Tour&quot; was eventually released in a 52-minute version to home video. After Fine&#x27;s stroke, Howard asked longtime Three Stooges supporting actor Emil Sitka to replace Larry, but this final lineup never shot any material.

==Personal life==
On June 7, 1925, Moe Howard married Helen Schonberger (December 19, 1899 - October 31, 1975), a cousin of Harry Houdini. The following year, Schonberger persuaded Howard to retire since she was pregnant. Howard attempted to earn a living in a succession of &quot;normal&quot; jobs, none of which was very successful, and he soon returned to working with Ted Healy.

Howard and Schonberger had two children, Joan Howard (April 2, 1927 – September 21, 2021) and Paul Howard (born July 8, 1935).

==Death and legacy==

Howard died of lung cancer at age 77 on May 4, 1975, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted a week earlier in April, just over three months after Larry Fine&#x27;s death, and just short of his 78th birthday. He was a heavy smoker for much of his adult life. He was interred in an outdoor crypt at Culver City&#x27;s Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery. His wife Helen Schonberger died of a heart attack on October 31, 1975, at age 75 and was interred in the crypt next to him on the right. At the time of his death, Howard was working on his autobiography titled &quot;I Stooged to Conquer&quot;. It was released in 1977 as &quot;Moe Howard and the Three Stooges&quot;.

Howard and the Three Stooges received a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on August 30, 1983, at 1560 Vine Street.

Howard was portrayed by Paul Ben-Victor in &quot;The Three Stooges&quot;, a 2000 made-for-TV biopic that focused on the trio&#x27;s years in show business and their off-screen lives. In the 2012 Farrelly brothers&#x27; film &quot;The Three Stooges&quot;, Chris Diamantopoulos portrays Moe and Skyler Gisondo portrays Young Moe.

==Description==
The green gram is an annual vine with yellow flowers and fuzzy brown pods.

=== Morphology ===
Mung bean (&quot;Vigna radiata&quot;) is a plant species of Fabaceae and is also known as green gram. It is sometimes confused with black gram (&quot;Vigna mungo&quot;) for their similar morphology, though they are two different species. The green gram is an annual vine with yellow flowers and fuzzy brown pods. There are three subgroups of &quot;Vigna radiata&quot;, including one cultivated (&quot;Vigna radiata subsp. radiata&quot;) and two wild ones (&quot;Vigna radiata subsp. sublobata&quot; and &quot;Vigna radiata subsp. glabra&quot;). It has a height of about .

Mung bean has a well-developed root system. The lateral roots are many and slender, with root nodules grown. Stems are much branched, sometimes twining at the tips. Young stems are purple or green, and mature stems are grayish-yellow or brown. They can be divided into erect cespitose, semi-trailing and trailing types. Wild types tend to be prostrate while cultivated types are more erect.

Leaves are ovoid or broad-ovoid, cotyledons die after emergence, and ternate leaves are produced on two single leaves. The leaves are 6–12 cm long and 5–10 cm wide. Racemes with yellow flowers are borne in the axils and tips of the leaves, with 10–25 flowers per pedicel, self-pollinated. The fruits are elongated cylindrical or flat cylindrical pods, usually 30–50 per plant. The pods are 5–10 cm long and 0.4–0.6 cm wide and contain 12–14 septum-separated seeds, which can be either cylindrical or spherical in shape, and green, yellow, brown, or blue in color. Seed colors and presence or absence of a rough layer are used to distinguish different types of mung bean.

=== Growth stages ===

Germination is typically within 4–5 days, but the actual rate varies according to the amount of moisture introduced during the germination stage. It is epigeal, with the stem and cotyledons emerging from the seedbed.

After germination, the seed splits, and a soft, whitish root grows. Mung bean sprouts are harvested during this stage. If not harvested, it develops a root system, then a green stem which contains two leaves and shoots up from the soil. After that, seed pods begin to form on its branches, with 10–15 seeds contained in each pod.

The maturation can take up to 60 days. Once matured, it can reach up to 30 inches (76 cm) tall, with multiple branches with seed pods. Most of the seed pods become darker, while some remain green.

=== Nitrogen fixation and cover crop ===
As a legume plant, mung bean is in symbiotic association with Rhizobia which enables it to fix atmospheric nitrogen (58–109 kg per ha mung bean). It can provide large amounts of biomass (7.16 t biomass/ha) and nitrogen to the soil (ranging from 30 to 251 kg/ha). The nitrogen fixation ability not only enables it to meet its own nitrogen requirement, but also benefits the succeeding crops. It can be used as a cover crop before or after cereal crops in rotation, which makes a good green manure.

==Taxonomy==
Mung beans are one of many species moved from the genus &quot;Phaseolus&quot; to &quot;Vigna&quot; in the 1970s. The previous names were &quot;Phaseolus aureus&quot; or &quot;P. radiatus.&quot;

== Cultivation ==

=== Varieties ===
The mung bean varieties now are mainly targeted in resistance to pests and diseases, particularly the bean weevil and mung bean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV). For now, the main varieties include Samrat, IPM2-3, SML 668 and Meha in India; Crystal, Jade-AU, Celera-AU，Satin II，Regur in Australia; Zhonglv No. 1, Zhonglv No. 2, Jilv No. 2, Jilv No. 7, Weilv No. 4, Jihong 9218, Jihong 8937, Bao 876-16, Bao 8824-17 in China. Also, with the help of the World Vegetable Center, the traits of mung bean have been considerably improved.

&#x27;Summer Moong&#x27; is a short-duration mung bean pulse crop grown in northern India. Due to its short duration, it can fit well in-between of many cropping systems. It is mainly cultivated in East and Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. It is considered to be the hardiest of all pulse crops and requires a hot climate for germination and growth.

=== Climate and soil requirements ===
Mung bean is a warm-season and frost-intolerant plant. Mung bean is suitable for being planted in temperate, sub-tropical and tropical regions. The most suitable temperature for mung bean&#x27;s germination and growth is . Mung bean has high adaptability to various soil types, while the best pH of the soil is between 6.2 and 7.2. Mung bean is a short-day plant and long days will delay its flowering and podding.

=== Harvest ===
The yield potential of mung bean is around 2.5 to 3.0&quot; &quot;t/ha, however, usually due to the resistance to environmental stress and improper management, the average productivity for mung bean is only 0.5&quot; &quot;t/ha. Due to the indeterminate flowering habit of mung bean, when facing proper environmental conditions, there can be both flowers and pods in one mung bean plant, which makes it difficult to harvest it. The perfect harvesting stage is when 90% of the pods&#x27; colour in one yield has been black. Mung beans can use a harvester for harvesting. It is important to set up the header in case of over-threshing.

=== Transportation and storage condition ===
The perfect moisture of grain for transportation is 13%. Before storage, the cleaning and grading process must be done. The ideal storage condition should keep the mung bean&#x27;s moisture at exactly 12%.

=== Pests, diseases and abiotic stress ===
Most of the mung bean cultivars have a yield potential of 1.8–2.5 tons/ha. However, the actual average productivity of mung bean hovers around 0.5–0.7 t/ha. Several factors constrain its yield, including biotic stresses (pests and diseases) and abiotic stresses. Stresses not only decrease productivity but also affect the physical quality of seeds, making them unusable or unfit for human consumption. All the stresses collectively can lead to significant yield losses of up to 10–100%.

==== Pests ====
Insect pests attack mung bean at all crop stages from sowing to storage stage and take a heavy toll on crop yield. Some insect pests directly damage the crop, while others act as vectors of diseases to transmit the virus.

Stem fly (bean fly) is one of the major pests of mung bean. This pest infests the crop within a week after germination and under epidemic conditions, it can cause total crop loss.

Whitefly, &quot;B. tabaci&quot;, is a serious pest in mung bean and damages the crop either directly by feeding on phloem sap and excreting honeydew on the plant that forms black sooty mould or indirectly by transmitting mung bean yellow mosaic disease (MYMD). Whitefly causes yield losses between 17% and 71% in mung bean.

Thrips infest mung bean both in the seedling and flowering stages. During the seedling stage, thrips infest the seedling&#x27;s growing point when it emerges from the ground, and under severe infestation, the seedlings fail to grow. Flowering thrips cause heavy damage and attack during flowering and pod formation, which feed on the pedicles and stigma of flowers. Under severe infestation, flowers drop and no pod formation takes place.

Spotted pod borer, &quot;Maruca vitrata&quot;, is a major insect pest in mung bean in the tropics and subtropics. The pest causes a yield loss of 2–84% in mung bean amounting to US $30 million. The larvae damage all the stages of the crop including flowers, stems, peduncles, and pods; however, heavy damage occurs at the flowering stage where the larvae form webs combining flowers and leaves.

Cowpea aphid sucks plant sap that causes loss of plant vigor and may lead to yellowing, stunting or distortion of plant parts. Further, aphids secrete honeydew (unused sap) which leads to the development of sooty mould on plant parts. Cowpea aphid also can act as a vector of the mung bean common mosaic virus.

Bruchid is the most severe stored pest of legume seeds worldwide, with damage up to 100% losses within 3–6 months, if not controlled. Bruchid infestation in mungbean results in weight loss, low germination, and nutritional changes in seeds, thereby reducing the nutritional and market value, rendering it unfit for human consumption, and agricultural and commercial uses.

==== Diseases ====

Mungbean yellow mosaic disease (MYMD) is a significant viral disease of mung bean, which causes severe yield losses annually. MYMD is caused by three distinct begomoviruses, transmitted by whitefly. The economic losses due to MYMD account for up to 85% yield reduction in India.

The major fungal diseases are Cercospora leaf spot (CLS), dry root rot, powdery mildew and anthracnose. Dry root rot (&quot;Macrophomina phaseolina&quot;) is an emerging disease of mungbean, causing 10–44% yield losses in mung bean production in India and Pakistan. The pathogen affects the fibrovascular system of the roots and basal internodes of its host, impeding the transport of water and nutrients to the upper parts of the plant.

Halo blight, bacterial leaf spot, and tan spot are significant bacterial diseases.

==== Abiotic stress ====
Abiotic stresses negatively influence plant growth and productivity and are the primary causes of extensive agricultural losses worldwide. Reduction in crop yield due to environmental variations has increased steadily over the decades.

Salinity affects crop growth and yield by way of osmotic stress, ion toxicity, and reduced nodulation which ultimately lead to reduced nitrogen-fixing ability. Excessive salt leads to leaf injury and then reduced photosynthesis.

High-temperature stress negatively affects reproductive development in mung bean and affects all reproductive traits like flower initiation, pollen viability, fertilization, pod set, seed quality, etc. High temperatures over 42 °C during summer causes hardening of seeds due to incomplete sink development.

Mung bean requires a light moisture regime in the soil during its growing period, while at the time of harvest, complete dry conditions are required. Since it is mostly grown under rainfed conditions, it is more susceptible to water deficiencies as compared to many other food legumes. Drought affects its growth and development by negatively affecting vegetative growth, flower initiation, abnormal pollen behavior and pod set. However, simultaneously, excess moisture or waterlogging, even for a short period of time, especially at the early vegetative stage may be detrimental to the crop.

Mung bean may also be affected by excess soil and atmospheric moisture during the rainy season which may lead to pre-harvest sprouting in mature pods. It deteriorates the quality of the seed/grain produced.

==== Integrated disease management ====
Using climate analysis tools delivered on the web can firstly help farmers interrogate climate records to ask questions relating to rainfall, temperature, radiation, and derived variables to avoid some of the abiotic stresses. Deployment of varieties with genetic resistance is the most effective and durable method for integrated disease management, in the meantime focusing on yield, height, grain quality, market opportunities and seed availability. For pre-harvest sprouting (PHS), the development of mung bean cultivars with a short (10–15 days) period of fresh seed dormancy (FSD) is important to curtail losses incurred by PHS.

=== Market ===
Mung bean plants have a long history of being consumed by humans. The main consumed parts are the seeds and sprouts. The mature seeds provide an invaluable source of digestible protein for humans in places where meat is lacking or where people are mostly vegetarian. Mung bean has a large market in Asia (India, Southeast Asia and East Asia) and is also consumed in Southern Europe and in the Southern US. Mung bean protein is considered safe as a novel food (NF) pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/2283. The consumption of mung bean varies depending on the geographic region. For instance, in India, mung bean is used in sweets, snacks and savoury items. In other parts of Asia, it is used in cakes, sprouts, noodles and soups. In Europe and America, it is mainly used as fresh bean sprouts. The consumption of mung beans as such in the US is in the order of 22–29&quot; &quot;g/capita per year, while the consumption in some areas of Asia can be as high as 2 kg/capita per year.

Mung bean is considered an alternative crop in many regions, which is generally preferable to sign a contract for the growing process before planting. In the US, the average price of mung bean is around $0.20 per pound. This is double the price of soybeans. The difference in production costs for mung bean and soybean is due to post-harvest cleaning and/or transportation. Overall, mung bean is considered to have market potential for its drought tolerance, and it is a food crop and not a feed crop, which can help buffer the economic risk from variability in commodity crop prices for farmers.

==Uses==


=== Nutritional value ===
The mung bean is recognized for its high nutritive value. A mung bean contains about 55–65% carbohydrate (equal to 630&quot; &quot;g/kg dry weight) and are rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals. It is composed of about 20–50% protein of total dry weight, among which globulin (60%) and albumin (25%) are the primary storage proteins (see table). The mung bean is considered to be a substantive source of dietary proteins. The proteolytic cleavage of these proteins is even higher during sprouting. Mung bean carbohydrates are easily digestible, which causes less flatulence in humans compared to other forms of legumes. Both seeds and sprouts of the mung bean produce lower calories compared to other cereals, which makes it a more attractive bean to obese and diabetic individuals.

=== Culinary ===
Whole cooked mung beans are generally prepared from dried beans by boiling until they are soft. Mung beans are light yellow in colour when their skins are removed. Mung bean paste can be made by hulling, cooking, and pulverizing the beans to a dry paste.

==== South Asia ====
Although whole mung beans are also occasionally used in Indian cuisine, beans without skins are more commonly used. In Karnataka, Maharashtra,Odisha, Gujarat, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, whole mung beans are commonly boiled to make a dry preparation often served with congee. Hulled mung beans can also be used in a similar fashion as whole beans for the purpose of making sweet soups.

In Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, mung beans are partially mashed, fermented, and made into fritters called &quot;mangode,&quot; which serves as a common tea time snack similar to Pakora.

In Goa, sprouted mung beans are cooked in a coconut milk based, mild curry called &quot;moonga&quot; &quot;gaathi&quot;.

Mung beans in some regional cuisines of India are stripped of their outer coats to make mung &quot;dal&quot;. In Odisha, West Bengal and Bangladesh the stripped and split bean is used to make a soup-like dal known as ().

In Southern India, state of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh, as well as in Maharashtra, steamed whole beans are seasoned with spices and fresh grated coconut. In South India, especially Andhra Pradesh, batter made from ground whole moong beans (including skin) is used to make a popular variety of dosa called () or pesara-dosa.

In Pakistan, cooked mung dal is often paired with boiled white basmati rice in a dish called &quot;dal chawal&quot;. If butter is added to this dal, it is called &quot;dal makhani&quot; and is eaten with chapati.

In Sri Lanka, boiled Mung beans are usually eaten with grated coconut and &quot;lunu-miris,&quot; a spicy chili and onion sambol, most commonly as a breakfast food. Mung beans are also added to kiribath, which is then termed &quot;mung-kiribath.&quot; During the traditional New Year Celebration (celebrated in April) mung beans are used to make a traditional fried sweet, &quot;mung-kavum.&quot;

==== East Asia ====
In southern Chinese cuisine, whole mung beans are used to make a , or dessert, called , which is served either warm or chilled. They are also often cooked with rice to make congee. Unlike in South Asia, whole mung beans seldom appear in savory dishes.

In Hong Kong, hulled mung beans and mung bean paste are made into ice cream or frozen ice pops. Mung bean paste is used as a common filling for Chinese mooncakes in East China and Taiwan. During the Dragon Boat Festival, the boiled and shelled beans are used as filling in zongzi prepared for consumption. The beans may also be cooked until soft, blended into a liquid, sweetened, and served as a beverage, popular in many parts of China. In South China and Vietnam, mung bean paste may be mixed with sugar, fat, and fruits or spices to make pastries, such as bánh đậu xanh.

In Korea, skinned mung beans are soaked and ground with some water to make a thick batter. This is used as a basis for the Korean pancakes called bindae-tteok. They are also commonly used for Hobak-tteok.

==== Southeast Asia ====
In the Philippines, &quot;ginisáng monggó/mónggo&quot; (sautéed mung bean stew), also known as &quot;monggó/mónggo guisado&quot; or &quot;balatong&quot;, is a savoury stew of whole mung beans with prawns or fish. It is traditionally served on Fridays of Lent, when the majority of Catholic Filipinos traditionally abstain from meat. Variants of &quot;ginisáng monggó/mónggo&quot; may also be made with chicken or pork. Mung beans are also used in the Filipino dessert &quot;ginataang munggo&quot; (also known as &quot;balatong&quot;), a rice gruel with coconut milk and sugar flavored with pandan leaves or vanilla.

Mung bean paste is also a common filling of pastries known as &quot;ondé-ondé&quot; and &quot;bakpia&quot; in Indonesia and &quot;hopia&quot; in the Philippines, and further afield in Guyana (where it is known as &quot;black eye cake&quot;). It is also used as a filling for &quot;pan de monggo&quot;, a Filipino bread. In Indonesia, mung beans are also made into a popular dessert snack called &quot;es kacang hijau&quot;, which has the consistency of a porridge. The beans are cooked with sugar, coconut milk, and a little ginger.

==== Middle East ====
A staple diet in some parts of the Middle East is mung beans and rice. Both are cooked together in a pilaf-like rice dish called , which means mung beans and rice.

===Bean sprouts===


Mung beans are germinated by leaving them in water for four hours of daytime light and spending the rest of the day in the dark. Mung bean sprouts can be grown under artificial light for four hours over the period of a week. They are usually simply called &quot;bean sprouts&quot;. However, when bean sprouts are called for in recipes, it generally refers to mung bean or soybean sprouts.

Mung bean sprouts are stir-fried as a Chinese vegetable accompaniment to a meal, usually with garlic, ginger, spring onions, or pieces of salted dried fish to add flavour. Uncooked bean sprouts are used in filling for Vietnamese spring rolls, as well as a garnish for &quot;phở&quot;. They are a major ingredient in a variety of Malaysian and Peranakan cuisine, including &quot;char kway teow&quot;, &quot;hokkien mee&quot;, &quot;mee rebus&quot;, and &quot;pasembor&quot;.

In Korea, slightly cooked mung bean sprouts, called &quot;sukjunamul&quot; (), are often served as a side dish. They are blanched (placed into boiling water for less than a minute), immediately cooled in cold water, and mixed with sesame oil, garlic, salt, and often other ingredients.

In the Philippines, mung bean sprouts are called &quot;togue&quot; and are most commonly used in &quot;lumpia&quot; rolls called &quot;lumpiang togue&quot;.

In India, mung bean sprouts are cooked with green chili, garlic, and other spices.

In Indonesia the food are often used as fillings like &quot;tahu isi&quot; (stuffed tofu) and complementary ingredient in many dishes such as &quot;rawon&quot; and &quot;soto&quot;.

In Japan, the sprouts are called moyashi.

===Starch===
Mung bean starch, which is extracted from ground mung beans, is used to make transparent cellophane noodles (also known as bean thread noodles, bean threads, glass noodles, &quot;fensi&quot; (), &quot;tung hoon&quot; (), , , or ). Cellophane noodles become soft and slippery when they are soaked in hot water. A variation of cellophane noodles, called mung bean sheets or green bean sheets, are also available.

In Korea, a jelly called &quot;nokdumuk&quot; (; also called &quot;cheongpomuk&quot;, ) is made from mung bean starch; a similar jelly, colored yellow with the addition of gardenia coloring, is called &quot;hwangpomuk&quot; ().

In northern China, mung bean jelly is called &quot;liangfen&quot; (), which is a very popular food during summer. The Hokkiens add sugar to mung bean jelly to make it a dessert called &quot;Lio̍k-tāu hún-kóe&quot; ().

===Plant-based protein===

Mung beans are increasingly used in plant-based meat and egg alternatives such as Beyond Meat and Eat Just&#x27;s Just Egg.

==History of domestication and cultivation==
The mung bean was domesticated in India, where its progenitor (&quot;Vigna radiata&quot; subspecies &quot;sublobata&quot;) occurs wild.

2nd millennium BCE scripture Yajurveda in its 4th chapter refers to &quot;mudga&quot; (मुद्ग) as one of the important grains and asks Rudra to bless with its good harvest (मु॒द्गाश्च॑ मे॒ खल्वा॑श्च मे) in Rudradhyaya - still prevalent and popular set of hymns in Shiva worship. The mung bean is listed as one of the nine auspicious grains (navdhānya) in Vedic astrology and associated with planet Budha (Mercury).

Carbonized mung beans have been discovered in many archeological sites in India. Areas with early finds include the eastern zone of the Harappan civilisation in modern-day Pakistan and western and northwestern India, where finds date back about 4,500 years, and South India in the modern state of Karnataka where finds date back more than 4,000 years. Some scholars, therefore, infer two separate domestications in the northwest and south of India. On the other hand, a recent study suggested a single genetic origin likely contributing to the loss of pod shattering, the key domestication trait in legumes. In South India, there is evidence for the evolution of larger-seeded mung beans 3,500 to 3,000 years ago. By about 3500 years ago mung beans were widely cultivated throughout India.

Cultivated mung beans later spread from India to China and Southeast Asia. Archaeobotanical research at the site of Khao Sam Kaeo in southern Thailand indicates that mung beans had arrived in Thailand by at least 2,200 years ago.

A genetic study demonstrated that, following its domestication in South Asia, mung bean spread sequentially to Southeast Asia and East Asia and eventually to Central Asia, despite the geographic proximity of South and Central Asia. The study suggests that the short and dry growing seasons in the northern regions of Asia were not suitable for southern cultivars, which had been bred for extended life cycles to maximize yield. This highlights the critical role of ecological factors, such as climate, in shaping crops evolution.

<text>Estyn is the education and training inspectorate for Wales. Its name comes from the Welsh language verb &quot;estyn&quot; meaning &quot;to reach (out), stretch or extend&quot;. Its function is to provide an independent inspection and advice service on quality and standards in education and training provided in Wales.

It is independent from, but funded by, the Welsh Government (section 104 of the Government of Wales Act 1998). His Majesty&#x27;s Chief Inspector of Education and Training in Wales (HMCI) and her staff are Crown and civil servants.

Meilyr Rowlands was appointed as HM Chief Inspector of Education and Training in Wales (HMCI) on 1 June 2015.

The strategic directors are Simon Brown HMI and Claire Morgan HMI.

The purpose of Estyn is to inspect and report on the quality and standards of education and training provided in Wales, including:
* how far education and training meet the needs of learners and contribute to their development and wellbeing;
* standards achieved; and
* the quality of leadership and training.

Estyn&#x27;s head office is in Cardiff. Estyn was awarded Investors in People Gold (IIP) accreditation in March 2011 and was re-awarded IIP Gold in 2018.

The equivalent body in Scotland is Education Scotland and in England it is Ofsted.

==Range of inspection==

Estyn inspects the following:

* nursery schools and settings that are maintained by, or receive funding from, local authorities;
* primary schools;
* secondary schools;
* special schools;
* pupil referral units;
* independent schools;
* further education;
* independent specialist colleges;
* adult community learning;
* local authority education services for children and young people;
* regional consortia for school improvement;
* teacher education and training;
* Welsh for adults;
* work-based learning; and
* learning in the justice sector.

Inspection reports are published on the Estyn website.

==Objectives==

===Strategic objectives===
Estyn&#x27;s strategic objectives are:

*Provide public accountability to service users on the quality and standards of education and training provision in Wales;
*Inform the development of national policy by the Welsh Government; and
*Build capacity in the delivery of education and training in Wales.

Estyn works in collaboration with the Care and Social Services Inspectorate for Wales (CSSIW), Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) and Wales Audit Office (WAO) to implement the Welsh Government&#x27;s policy statement on Inspection, Audit and Regulation. In partnership with Ofsted, Estyn has responsibility for inspecting learners in England who are funded by the Welsh Government and who attend independent special schools, work-based learning courses, and provision for young people in youth offending teams. Estyn inspects, through joint working with HMI Probation and HMI Prisons, the education of offenders in secure estate and prisons in Wales.

<doc id="465844" wikidata="Q442145" url="?curid=465844" title="Final clause">
<text>A final clause in linguistics is a dependent adverbial clause expressing purpose. For this reason it is also referred to as a &quot;purposive clause&quot; or a &quot;clause of purpose&quot;.

In English, final clauses are relatively rare. A final clause is a reply to a question containing the question word &quot;wherefore&quot; or &quot;what for&quot; (sometimes also &quot;why&quot;). The prescription for their construction is rather complicated:

A final clause is introduced by the following linking words (conjunctions): 
* that (sometimes preceded by &quot;in order&quot; or &quot;so&quot;, or, in literary language, &quot;to the end&quot;)
* lest (equivalent to &quot;that not&quot;, sometimes with the meaning &quot;for fear that&quot;, both of these naturally belonging to the &quot;that&quot; category)

Depending on the conjunction used, two forms of final clause exist:
* if &quot;that&quot; is used, the final clause takes may in the present and future, and might in the past, sometimes also [[shall]] because of the Latin subjunctive
** Wherefore do you play the violin? – I play the violin &quot;that&quot; I &quot;may&quot; enjoy myself.
** What did you hit me for? – I hit you &quot;so that&quot; they &quot;might&quot; not become suspicious of us.
** Why did you go to the city? – I went to the city &quot;in order that&quot; I &quot;might&quot; buy some new clothes in the shopping centre.
** I grabbed the rope &quot;that&quot; I &quot;might&quot; &quot;not&quot; fall.
* if &quot;lest&quot; is used, the final clause takes should or may (the latter being obsolescent, and used only for the present and the future), or the subjunctive.
** I grabbed the rope &quot;lest&quot; I &quot;should&quot; fall.
** I play the violin &quot;lest&quot; I &quot;should&quot; (or &quot;may&quot;) be bored.
** He does what he is told &quot;lest&quot; he &quot;be&quot; sacked. (subjunctive)
** He used the subjunctive lest they thought him uncouth. (past subjunctive, which appears the same in UK English as the past)

Final clauses that refer to the same subject as the main clause of the sentence can be expressed with &quot;to&quot;, &quot;in order to&quot;, &quot;so as to&quot;, &quot;for fear of&quot;, et cetera. This short form of the final clause is much more common than the final clause itself.
* She reads that she may be wise. = She reads to be wise.
* You cried for fear that you might not have impressed the examiners. = You cried for fear of not impressing the examiners.
* I paint in order that I may be happy. = I paint to be happy.

Karsten Schmidtke-Bode examined final clauses, in the context of purpose clauses, as intended to bring about a specific matrix clause situation in a complex sentence construction. There are recurring trends of grammatical coding across many languages. It is common for languages to have purpose clauses expressed in different strategies. Purpose clause topological mapping aims to explain the universal conceptual characteristics of morphosyntactic coding in the communicative functions, as well as the cognitive-psychological mechanisms involved in the use. Purpose clauses differ from typical adverbial relations, and are a special case which, is closely related to complement clauses and some relative clauses.

Purpose, as a simple grammatical infinitive, follows verbs that express or imply motion in English, according to Hubert Gibson Sharin.

<text>The Battle of Cape Ecnomus or Eknomos () was a naval battle, fought off southern Sicily, in 256 BC, between the fleets of Carthage and the Roman Republic, during the First Punic War (264–241 BC). The Carthaginian fleet was commanded by Hanno and Hamilcar; the Roman fleet jointly by the consuls for the year, Marcus Atilius Regulus and Lucius Manlius Vulso Longus. It resulted in a clear victory for the Romans.

The Roman fleet of 330 warships plus an unknown number of transports had sailed from Ostia, the port of Rome, and had embarked approximately 26,000 picked legionaries shortly before the battle. They planned to cross to Africa and invade the Carthaginian homeland, in what is now Tunisia. The Carthaginians were aware of the Romans&#x27; intentions and mustered all available warships, 350, off the south coast of Sicily to intercept them. With a combined total of about 680 warships carrying up to 290,000 crew and marines, the battle was arguably the single largest battle of ancient history, and was possibly the largest naval battle in history by the number of combatants involved.

When the fleets met, the Carthaginians took the initiative and the battle devolved into three separate conflicts, where the Carthaginians hoped that their superior ship-handling skills would win the day. After a prolonged and confusing day of fighting, the Carthaginians were decisively defeated, losing 30 ships sunk and 64 captured to Roman losses of 24 ships sunk.

==Sources==
The main source for almost every aspect of the First Punic War is the historian Polybius ( – BC), a Greek sent to Rome in 167 BC as a hostage. His works include a now lost manual on military tactics, but he is best known for &quot;The Histories&quot;, written sometime after 167 BC, or about a century after the Battle of Ecnomus. Polybius&#x27;s work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral—between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.

Most Carthaginian written records were destroyed along with their capital, Carthage, in 146 BC and so Polybius&#x27;s account of the First Punic War is based on several, now lost, Greek and Latin sources. Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about. Only the first book of the 40 comprising &quot;The Histories&quot; deals with this war, but the modern historian G. K. Tipps considers that &quot;The Histories&quot; contains &quot;an extensive and meticulously detailed account of the Battle of Ecnomus&quot;. The accuracy of Polybius&#x27;s account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius&#x27;s account. Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form, and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea. Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of Diodorus Siculus and Dio Cassius, although the classicist Adrian Goldsworthy states that &quot;Polybius&#x27;s account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts&quot;. Other sources include inscriptions, archaeological evidence and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the trireme &quot;Olympias&quot;.

==Background==
=== Operations in Sicily ===

In 264 BC, the states of Carthage and Rome went to war, starting the First Punic War. Carthage was a well-established maritime power in the Western Mediterranean; Rome had recently unified mainland Italy south of the Po under its control. The immediate cause of the war was control of the Sicilian town of Messana (modern Messina). More broadly both sides wished to control Syracuse, the most powerful city-state on Sicily. By 256 BC, the war had grown into a struggle in which the Romans were attempting to defeat decisively the Carthaginians and, at a minimum, control the whole of Sicily.

The Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty. The Romans were essentially a land-based power and had gained control of most of Sicily. The war there had reached a stalemate, as the Carthaginians focused on defending their well-fortified towns and cities; these were mostly on the coast and so could be supplied and reinforced without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere. The focus of the war shifted to the sea, where the Romans had little experience; on the few occasions they had previously felt the need for a naval presence they had relied on small squadrons provided by their allies.

===Ships===
During this period the standard warship of the Carthaginian navy was the quinquereme, meaning &quot;five-oared&quot;. The quinquereme was a galley, long, wide at water level, with its deck standing above the sea, and displacing around . The galley expert John Coates has suggested that they could maintain for extended periods. The quinquereme was superior as a warship to the previous mainstay of Mediterranean navies, the trireme, and, being heavier, performed better than the triremes in bad weather. The modern replica galley &quot;Olympias&quot; has achieved speeds of and cruised at for hours on end.
The generally accepted theory regarding the arrangement of oarsmen in quinqueremes is that there would be sets – or files – of three oars, one above the other, with two oarsmen on each of the two uppermost oars and one on the lower, for a total of five oarsmen per file. This would be repeated down the side of a galley for a total of 28 files on each side; 168 oars in total. At least one man on each oar would need to have had some experience if the ship was to be handled effectively. Vessels were built as cataphract, or &quot;protected&quot;, ships, with a closed hull to protect the rowers, and a full deck able to carry marines and catapults. Carthaginian quinqueremes used a separate &quot;oar box&quot; which contained the rowers and was attached to the main hull. This development meant the rowers would be located above or at deck level, which allowed the hull to be strengthened, and increased carrying capacity; as well as improving the ventilation conditions of the rowers, an important factor in maintaining their stamina, and thereby improving the ship&#x27;s maintainable speed.

In 260 BC Romans set out to construct a fleet of 100 quinqueremes and 20 triremes. They used a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme as a blueprint for their own. As novice shipwrights, the Romans built copies that were heavier than the Carthaginian vessels, and so slower and less manoeuvrable. The quinquereme provided the workhorse of the Roman and Carthaginian fleets throughout the Punic Wars, although hexaremes (six oarsmen per bank), quadriremes (four oarsmen per bank) and triremes are also occasionally mentioned. So ubiquitous was the type that Polybius uses it as a shorthand for &quot;warship&quot; in general. A quinquereme carried a crew of 300: 280 oarsmen and 20 deck crew and officers; it would also normally carry a complement of 40 marines; if battle was thought to be imminent this would be increased to as many as 120.
===Naval operations===

Getting the oarsmen to row as a unit, let alone to execute the more complex battle manoeuvres, required long and arduous training. As a result, the Romans were initially at a disadvantage against the more experienced Carthaginians. To counter Carthaginian superiority, the Romans introduced the &quot;corvus&quot;, a bridge wide and long, with a heavy spike on the underside, which was designed to pierce and anchor into an enemy ship&#x27;s deck. This allowed Roman legionaries acting as marines to board enemy ships and capture them, rather than employing the previously traditional tactic of ramming. All warships were equipped with rams, a triple set of bronze blades weighing up to positioned at the waterline. They were made individually by the lost-wax method to fit immovably to a galley&#x27;s prow. In the century prior to the Punic Wars, boarding had become increasingly common and ramming had declined, as the larger and heavier vessels adopted in this period lacked the speed and manoeuvrability necessary to ram, while their sturdier construction reduced the ram&#x27;s effect even in case of a successful attack. The Roman adaptation of the &quot;corvus&quot; was a progression of this trend and compensated for their initial disadvantage in ship manoeuvring skills. However, the added weight in the prow compromised the ship&#x27;s manoeuvrability, and in rough sea conditions the &quot;corvus&quot; became useless.

Largely because of the Romans&#x27; use of the &quot;corvus&quot;, the Carthaginians were defeated in large naval battles at Mylae in 260 BC and Sulci in 257 BC. These victories, and their frustration at the continuing stalemate in Sicily, led the Romans to focus on a sea-based strategy and to develop a plan to invade the Carthaginian heartland in North Africa and threaten their capital, Carthage (close to what is now Tunis), in the hope of a war-winning outcome. Both sides were determined to establish naval supremacy and invested large amounts of money and manpower in maintaining and increasing the size of their navies.
==Prelude==

The Carthaginian fleet mustered at Carthage in the late spring of 256 BC, before sailing for Lilybaeum (modern Marsala), their major base in Sicily, to resupply and to embark soldiers to use as marines. It then sailed east along the coast of Sicily to Heraclea Minoa, the easternmost of the Sicilian towns the Carthaginians still held and was joined by those ships already operating from Sicily, at least 62 and probably more. These brought the Carthaginian fleet up to 350 ships, nearly all quinqueremes, commanded by Hanno, who had been defeated at Agrigentum six years earlier, and Hamilcar, the victor of the Battle of Thermae (not to be confused with Hamilcar Barca).

The Romans mustered at about the same time, probably at Ostia, the port of Rome. The Roman fleet consisted of 330 warships, the large majority quinqueremes. They were accompanied by an unknown number of transports, mostly carrying the horses of the invasion force. The two consuls for the year, Marcus Atilius Regulus and Lucius Manlius Vulso Longus, were given command of the fleet; each sailed in a hexareme, the only larger ships noted as participating in the battle. The Roman fleet sailed south along the coast of Italy, crossed to Sicily at Messana, and sailed south and then west to the roadstead at Phintias (modern Licata) where they rendezvoused with the Roman army on Sicily. The Roman fleet embarked 80 picked legionaries on each warship, intending to either land them in Africa in pursuit of their strategic objective or to complement the galleys&#x27; marines if the Carthaginian navy challenged them.

In total the Roman fleet had 140,000 men on board: rowers, other crew, marines and soldiers. The number of Carthaginians is less certainly known but was estimated by Polybius at 150,000, and most modern historians broadly support this. If these figures are approximately correct, then the Battle of Ecnomus is possibly the largest naval battle of all time, by the number of combatants involved.

Rather than sail directly from Phintias for North Africa, the Romans sailed west, intending to cross the Strait of Sicily at its narrowest point. This would minimise the time the fleet spent in the open sea; ships of the time, especially the less seaworthy galleys, kept in sight of land whenever possible. The Carthaginians were aware of the Roman intentions and correctly anticipated their route. They intercepted the Roman fleet to the east of Heraclea Minoa, after it had left Licata. The fleets are commonly stated to have met off Cape Ecnomus, immediately after the Romans left Licata. However, this is not supported by Polybius, or any other primary source; it is a modern convention. The medieval historian Joannes Zonaras cites Dio Cassius to locate the battle immediately to the east of Heraclea Minoa.
==Battle==

The Roman fleet moved along the Sicilian coast in a compact formation. They were deployed in four squadrons, of unequal size. The first two squadrons (I and II) led the way, each arrayed in echelon, together forming a wedge. The squadron on the right was under Vulso and the squadron on the left under Regulus. The consuls&#x27; hexaremes sailed alongside each other, at the &quot;point&quot; of the wedge. The third squadron (III) was immediately behind them, towing the transports. The fourth (IV) was in line abreast, protecting the rear. The Carthaginians sailed east, expecting to encounter the Roman fleet, and were possibly warned of its approach by small scout-ships. They were organised in three unequally-sized squadrons, arranged in a single line abreast with their left, landward, wing (1) advanced. The Carthaginian centre (2) was commanded by Hamilcar and their right (3) by Hanno. The fleets sighted each other and both advanced.

As the two leading Roman squadrons, their first and second, made for the middle of the Carthaginian line, Hamilcar staged a feigned retreat with his centre, the Carthaginian second squadron, probably by rowing in reverse, and the consuls pursued. The Roman third squadron, towing the transports, fell behind and a gap opened between the two leading and the two rear Roman squadrons. Both Carthaginian wings advanced on the two rearmost squadrons, by-passing the Roman centre and attempting to attack from the flanks to avoid the &quot;corvus&quot; boarding mechanism. The Carthaginian landward squadron, the first, attacked the Roman warships towing transports, the Roman third squadron, which had been exposed by the advance of their centre. The Romans cast off their tows to be able to manoeuvre. Hanno&#x27;s force, to seaward, the Carthaginian third squadron, was composed of the fastest and most manoeuvrable Carthaginian ships and attacked the Roman squadron at the rear of their fleet, their fourth; which was being impeded by the now-drifting transports. Having separated the Roman centre from the two rearmost squadrons, Hamilcar and his ships of the Carthaginian second squadron turned to fight the pursuing Romans. The battle thus devolved into three separate fights.

Modern and ancient historians have both suggested that Hamilcar&#x27;s retreat was intended to specifically bring this situation about: to break up the compact Roman formation and allow the Carthaginians to use their greater tactical skill to outmanoeuvre the threat of the &quot;corvi&quot; and ram the Roman ships in their sides or rears. At the time of Ecnomus neither the speed nor manoeuvrability of the Roman ships, nor the skills of their crews, were up to the standards of the Carthaginians. The Romans had become more skilled over the four years since they first built their navy, while the recent large increase in the size of the Carthaginian navy meant many of their crews had little experience. Consequently, the superiority in their ships&#x27; manoeuvrability and their crews&#x27; seamanship was less than they thought. Furthermore, the solidly built Roman ships were less susceptible to the effect of a successful ramming attack than the Carthaginians had anticipated. The three fights became shapeless brawls, where superior ship handling counted for little. On the other hand, when the Romans were able to employ their &quot;corvi&quot; and board, they had the advantage of the experienced and heavily armoured legionaries they had embarked to transport to Africa.

The commanders of the Roman third squadron, which had been towing the transports, felt outmatched and retreated to the shore. Despite having started the battle echeloned forward from their main fleet, their opponents, the ships of the Carthaginian first squadron, were unable to cut them off from the coast. Once there, the Roman third squadron took up a defensive position: they halted in shallow water, facing away from land, so that the Carthaginians could only attack their flanks with difficulty, and had to face the Romans&#x27; &quot;corvi&quot; if they attacked from the front. In spite of this, this fight was the one where the Romans were most hard-pressed. The rearmost Roman squadron was also outfought by the Carthaginian&#x27;s third squadron. It put up a stout resistance, but its situation became desperate.

The battle was decided in the fight between the two fleets&#x27; centresthe Roman first and second squadrons fighting the Carthaginian second squadron. Several Roman ships were rammed and sunk, as were several Carthaginian. More Carthaginian ships were boarded and captured. After a long fight the crews of the surviving ships of the Carthaginian centre lost heart and fled. The Roman centre broke off its pursuit in response to the consuls&#x27; signals, and rowed back to assist their two rear squadrons, and to rescue the drifting transports. Vulso&#x27;s first squadron attacked the Carthaginian first squadron. Regulus&#x27; second squadron launched an attack against Hanno&#x27;s third squadron. He approached the Carthaginians from their disengaged side, threatening to trap them against the Roman fourth squadron which they were already fighting. Hanno withdrew with those ships of the Carthaginian third squadron that were able to extricate themselves. Regulus and his Roman second squadron then moved to reinforce Vulso&#x27;s attack with the Roman first squadron on the last Carthaginian squadron still fighting, the first, which was now surrounded. This was when the Carthaginians suffered their heaviest losses; 50 of their ships, trapped against the shore and heavily outnumbered, surrendered. After a prolonged and confused day of fighting the Carthaginians had been decisively defeated, losing 30 ships sunk and 64 captured to Roman losses of 24 ships sunk. The Carthaginians lost between 30,000 and 40,000 men, the majority captured; Roman casualties were approximately 10,000 killed.

==Aftermath==

Following the battle, the Romans landed in Sicily for repairs, to rest the crews, and to reorganise their forces. The prows of the captured Carthaginian ships were sent to Rome to adorn the speaker&#x27;s platform of the Forum, according to the tradition initiated after the Battle of Mylae. The Carthaginian fleet fell back to home waters, where it prepared to fight again. Its commanders were unable to predict the Roman landing point and were on the western side of Cape Bon when the Romans under Regulus successfully landed on the east at Aspis (modern Kelibia) and besieged it. Manlius returned to Rome and celebrated a triumph. Hamilcar and 5,500 Carthaginian troops were withdrawn from Sicily to reinforce the Carthaginian army in Africa.

Regulus&#x27; invasion initially went well and in 255 BC the Carthaginians sued for peace. The terms proposed by Regulus were so harsh that the Carthaginians fought on, defeating his army. The Romans sent a fleet to evacuate their survivors and the Carthaginians attempted to oppose it. In the resulting Battle of Cape Hermaeum off Africa the Carthaginians were heavily defeated, losing 114 ships captured. The Roman fleet, in turn, was devastated by a storm while returning to Italy, losing 384 ships and 100,000 men. It is possible that the presence of the corvus made the Roman ships much less seaworthy; there is no record of their being used after this disaster.

The war eventually ended in 241 BC with a Roman victory at the Battle of the Aegates Islands, leading to an agreed peace. Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole. The immense effort of building 1,000 galleys during the war laid the foundation for Rome&#x27;s maritime dominance for 600 years.

<text>Football Manager, also known as Worldwide Soccer Manager in North America from 2004 to 2008, is a series of football management simulation video games developed by British developer Sports Interactive and published by Sega. The game began its life in 1992 as &quot;Championship Manager&quot;. Following the break-up of their partnership with original publishers Eidos Interactive, triggered by the fiasco release of &quot;Championship Manager 4&quot; in 2003, Sports Interactive lost the naming rights to Eidos Interactive but retained the game engine and data, and re-branded the game &quot;Football Manager&quot; with their new publisher Sega. The latest version of &quot;Football Manager&quot;, titled &quot;Football Manager 2024&quot;, was released on 6 November 2023. &quot;Football Manager 2024&quot; is the most played title in series history, clocking 7 million players by the end of February 2024. &quot;Football Manager 25&quot;, originally intended for a November 2024 release, was cancelled in February 2025 after multiple delays.

==Main series==
===&quot;Football Manager 2005&quot;===
On 12 February 2004, after splitting from publishers Eidos Interactive, it was announced that Sports Interactive, developers of the &quot;Championship Manager&quot; game, had retained the rights to the source code but not the rights to the title &quot;Championship Manager&quot;, which were held onto by Eidos (who previously acquired the brand rights from Domark upon their merger in 1995). These developments led to a further announcement that future Sports Interactive football management simulation games would be released under the famous &quot;Football Manager&quot; brand name. Whilst the &quot;Championship Manager&quot; series would go on, Eidos no longer had any source code or a developer for &quot;Championship Manager&quot;.

Having been left without a publisher for its football management series, Sports Interactive teamed up with Sega. In April 2006, Sports Interactive was acquired completely by the publisher in a continuing trend of consolidation within the games industry. The first game released under the newly acquired &quot;Football Manager&quot; brand was &quot;Football Manager 2005&quot;. Commonly known as &quot;FM 2005&quot;, it competed directly with &quot;Championship Manager 5&quot; from Eidos-funded Beautiful Game Studios. &quot;Football Manager 2005&quot; included an updated user interface, a refined game engine, updated database and competition rules, pre and post-match information, international player news, cup summary news, a 2D match engine, coach reports on squads, jobcentre for non-playing positions, mutual contract termination, enhanced player loan options, manager mind games, and various other features. &quot;Football Manager&quot; 2005 was released in the UK on 5 November 2004, closely followed by releases in many other countries around the world. The Macintosh (Mac) version of the game came on the same dual format disk as the Windows version, so its sales were also included. &quot;Football Manager 2005&quot; became both the 5th fastest-selling PC game of all time and SEGA Europe&#x27;s fastest selling game.

===&quot;Football Manager 2006&quot;===
&quot;Football Manager 2006&quot; for Windows and Mac OS was released in the UK on 21 October 2005 (two weeks earlier than the originally stated 4 November 2005 release). On the same day as the game&#x27;s release, Sports Interactive also released a patch to fix some bugs discovered during the Beta and Gold stages of development. In its first week of release, it became the second-fastest-selling PC game of all-time in the UK.

Essentially a season update of &quot;FM 2005&quot;, it includes many small adjustments and improvements to the general gameplay. These adjustments include team-talks, simplified training, and in-game help screens. Furthermore, the game is updated by its many researchers (unpaid fans of the game augmented by in-house collaboration). The database is usually updated twice in the period of the release of the game. The first comes with the game and the second is usually downloadable in February as a free data update to reflect the changes which take place during the winter opening of the FIFA transfer window. As has been customary with the series, a beta demo of the game was released on 12 September 2005. This was later followed on 30 September 2005 by a gold demo. This is a cut-down, limited time version of the full game, which is sent to the game manufacturers. With a special download from Sports Interactive, one can play as the fictional football team Harchester United from Sky One&#x27;s series &quot;Dream Team&quot;.

====&quot;Football Manager 2006&quot; – Xbox 360====
The Xbox 360 version was released on 13 April 2006 and is the first home console game in the &quot;Football Manager&quot; series. The full 50 playable league systems are included, as well as a 250,000-strong player database (very near to the figure of the PC version). Due to the large save files of the game, which is region free, the Xbox 360 hard disk drive is required. This version also makes use of the Xbox Live functionality, allowing players to create online leagues and cups with up to 16 human-controlled teams using team data they have exported from their offline game. Voice chat is fully supported during online play. It was also confirmed that Sports Interactive would release new content through the Xbox Live Marketplace system.

===&quot;Football Manager 2007&quot;===
On 8 June 2006, Sports Interactive published details on &quot;Football Manager 2007&quot;. On 1 October 2006, Sports Interactive released a Gold Demo of &quot;Football Manager 2007&quot;, available in two versions: vanilla and strawberry. Both versions allow users to play six months into a season. The strawberry version contains a larger collection of quickstarts so users can try out more leagues. It also contains more graphics than the vanilla version. &quot;Football Manager 2007&quot; was released on 18 October 2006.

New features in the 2007 version of &quot;Football Manager&quot; include the ability to include pictures for the player as the manager, substantially increased media interaction such as approaches from national newspaper journalists about the upcoming match or asking for comments on a player&#x27;s performance in recent matches, and new varying degrees of criticism or praise for players (happy with form or very pleased with form rather than just one generic good term). A similar feature has been included for such actions as admiring players or attempting to unsettle transfer targets. Improvements have also been made to board request interactions.

The main improvement lauded by Sports Interactive for this version of &quot;Football Manager&quot; is the improved scouting system. Scouts&#x27; and coaches&#x27; experience is now shown graphically via bar charts and scouts gain knowledge from areas they have scouted previously. To go with this, it is now possible to get feeder/parent club status, which allows to either send players to lower league teams to gain experience, make it easier to get work permits, merchandise sales in other areas, or, as a lower league team, to receive reserve and youth team players on free, season long loans and to generate extra revenue through associated fees and friendly matches. A patch has been released to combat some of the main bugs in the game, such as unrealistic scout reports and high amounts of injuries sustained whilst playing on the pitch. On 27 July 2007, the &quot;Football Manager&quot; website was updated with a new &quot;Football Manager 2008&quot; section.

===&quot;Football Manager 2008&quot;===
On 3 October 2007, Sega Europe Ltd and Sports Interactive announced &quot;Football Manager 2008&quot; to be released 19 October. The release date was brought forward by a day to 18 October 2007 due to some retailers shipping the game early. There were a number of new features: all features in matches seamlessly follow on from the previous one; a mini radar pitch appears during tactical changes; improved International management; new skin; advisor system; improved notebook system; a revamped captain selection; improved board and fan confidence system; transfer centre to track transfers; improved match engine; the player may change pitch dimensions; award system overhaul; in-game all-time best elevens; a revamped finance system; collective win bonuses; FaceGen system for new-gen players; and a new calendar.

===&quot;Football Manager 2009&quot;===
On 3 September 2008, Sports Interactive released a preview video announcing &quot;Football Manager 2009&quot; to be released on 14 November. The main difference from past versions was the inclusion of a 3D match engine for the first time in the game&#x27;s history. Other new features included the ability to have female managers and staff, a new press conference system, more in-depth feedback from assistant manager, and a more realistic transfer system. The latest incarnation of &quot;Football Manager&quot; was also released in DVD format for the first time.

The use of online-activation DRM utilised by Sports Interactive resulted in issues for consumers activating either online, or phone. This was the result of a well orchestrated DDoS attack launched upon activation servers and phone lines, resulting in many users on the Windows platform unable to activate and play. On 17 December 2008, Sports Interactive announced a deal with Arsenal F.C. to release an exclusive version of &quot;Football Manager 2009&quot;, containing all official Arsenal squad player pictures, and an exclusive skin in Arsenal&#x27;s colours. Shortly following this announcement, Sports Interactive reinforced their pursuit of online retailers by offering &quot;Football Manager 2009&quot; through eSellerate for the Mac OS X platform on 23 December 2008. This is the first incarnation of the game to be available to global users through online distribution.

===&quot;Football Manager 2010&quot;===
On 12 August 2009, Sports Interactive &amp; Sega Europe Ltd. announced that &quot;Football Manager 2010&quot; for PC and Apple Macintosh, and &quot;Football Manager Handheld 2010&quot; for PlayStation Portable was to be released on 30 October 2009. The include competitions are Challenge Cup and Challenge Cup qualification, as well as the Caribbean Championship. This version of &quot;Football Manager&quot; has been very successful, managing to gain the number 1 spot in the gaming charts. There have been many improvements made to &quot;Football Manager 2010&quot;, including the following:

* Totally revamped user interface making it simpler and quicker to find the information.
* Match Analysis tool showing the actions of each player on the pitch, allowing to pinpoint any team&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses.
* Making changes from the touchline by shouting instructions from the touchline instantly.

===&quot;Football Manager 2013&quot;===
In a press conference in early September 2012, the makers of the &quot;Football Manager&quot; series revealed a few new features in &quot;Football Manager 2013&quot;. These included the addition of a director of football, being able to give certain roles to other staff that managers would have to do themselves in previous games, taxes, a new way of making loan deals and the addition of Classic Mode where players could go through one season in eight hours without having to customize training or deal with team talk. On 28 September 2012, the release date was announced as 2 November 2012. If the game is pre-ordered, a beta version of the game would be available two weeks prior to 2 November 2012, with any saved data being able to be transferred to the release version. The South Sudan national football team was added.

===&quot;Football Manager 2014&quot;===
In August 2013, the Sports Interactive official website unveiled the main tweaks and upgrades to be added in &quot;Football Manager 2014&quot;, the most noticeable being the decision to release a simultaneous version for the Linux operating system. Among the other changes announced were extended options in transfer and contract negotiations, as well as player conversations, the ability to play with more than just three nations loaded in Classic Mode, a tactical overhaul, and improvements to the 3D match engine. Studio director and long-time &quot;Football Manager&quot; lead Miles Jacobson also stated that for a week in mid-August 2013 that he would announce one new feature every day via his Twitter feed, the first feature being the ability to arrange testimonial matches. On 13 September 2013, the release date was announced as 31 October 2013. If the game is pre-ordered, a beta version of the game would be available two weeks prior to 31 October 2013, with any saved data being able to be transferred to the release version.

===&quot;Football Manager 2016&quot;===
===&quot;Football Manager 2017&quot;===
===&quot;Football Manager 2018&quot;===
The release of &quot;Football Manager 2018&quot; introduced a Dynamics team morale system, which allows managers to see team hierarchies and a more in depth team cohesion rating. The scouting mechanic has also had an overhaul, with it being more lifelike, with scouts knowledge of players scaling between 0 and 100%. A Nintendo Switch version was released on 13 April 2018.

===&quot;Football Manager 2019&quot;===
===&quot;Football Manager 2020&quot; ===
===&quot;Football Manager 2021&quot;===
===&quot;Football Manager 2022&quot;===
===&quot;Football Manager 2023&quot;===
===&quot;Football Manager 2024&quot;===

&quot;Football Manager 2024&quot; was released on 7 December 2023. It became the most played title in series history, with 7 million players by February 2024.

===&quot;Football Manager 25&quot; (cancelled)===
A planned title, &quot;Football Manager 25&quot;, using the Unity game engine, was originally scheduled for release in early November 2024, though was postponed to late November then quickly postponed again to March 2025, and was ultimately cancelled in February 2025.

The game was set to feature the series debut of women&#x27;s football; however, several features were slated for removal – international football, create-a-club, touchline shouts, in-game social media, versus mode, challenge mode and fantasy draft – mostly with the aim of meeting release date targets with the promise that most would return in future instalments.

==Other games==
===&quot;Football Manager Mobile&quot;===
&quot;Football Manager Mobile&quot;, known as &quot;Football Manager Handheld&quot; (&quot;FMH&quot;) upon inception, was first released on 13 April 2006 on PlayStation Portable (PSP). This was Sports Interactive&#x27;s first ever game for a handheld console and was designed to be a separate game and play somewhat differently from the PC/Mac versions of the game due to the different nature of the handheld consoles. The game was designed to be more similar in feel and play to earlier Sports Interactive products, being much faster in nature while retaining the feeling of being a realistic simulation.

In April 2010, the game became available on the iOS products. The iOS version of the game is very different in nature to that on the PSP and it contains a wholly new UI because of the touch screen nature of those devices. In April 2012, the game was also made available on Android devices in a version very similar in nature to the iOS version. In 2015, a new 2D match engine was introduced for iOS and Android devices, as well as an opportunity to purchase an in-game editor. These early version of the mobile game utilized the PISD Ltd technology to target the handheld markets. The 2016 edition of the game saw its name change to &quot;Football Manager Mobile&quot;. In 2018, &quot;Football Manager Mobile&quot; was ranked number 10 on paid games. In 2020, &quot;Football Manager Mobile 2020&quot; became the first game in the series to reach 1 million downloads on all platforms. In 2023, &quot;Football Manager 2024 Mobile&quot; was released as a Netflix Games exclusive on both iOS and Android. 

===&quot;Football Manager Live&quot;===
On 20 April 2007, Sega Europe Ltd and Sports Interactive released details for &quot;Football Manager Live&quot;, which would be a brand new massively multiplayer online game based on PISD Ltd technology. Released on 4 November 2008, &quot;Football Manager Live&quot; had its roots set in the &quot;Football Manager&quot; series but was designed specifically as a massively multiplayer online game. On 12 December 2008, the first Community Day was arranged by Sports Interactive and Sega. The future of the series and many other matters were discussed with a number of fans who decided to show up for the event. On 14 April 2011, it was announced that &quot;Football Manager Live&quot; would be discontinued after all Gameworlds (servers) completed their next season (28 day period), which was due around the end of May 2011.

===&quot;Football Manager Online&quot;===
On 12 March 2015, Sega Publishing Korea Ltd. and Sports Interactive released details for &quot;Football Manager Online&quot;, which would be a brand new massively multiplayer online game.

=== &quot;Football Manager Touch&quot; ===
A successor to &quot;Football Manager Handheld&quot; and &quot;Football Manager Classic&quot;, the &quot;Football Manager Touch&quot; series began in 2015 with the release of &quot;Football Manager Touch 2016&quot;. The game was available on iPad and Android tablets, as well as via Steam. In 2018, the studio began releasing editions of &quot;Football Manager Touch&quot; on the Nintendo Switch. It was released in this way through to &quot;Football Manager Touch 2022&quot;, when the tablet, Steam, and Epic Games Store versions was discontinued and it was only released on Nintento Switch. Tablet users got access to the game again from &quot;Football Manager Touch 2023&quot; onwards when the studio signed a deal with Apple to release it on Apple Arcade.

===&quot;Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed&quot;===
&quot;Football Manager&quot; is represented with a racer named Football Manager in the cross-over game &quot;Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed&quot;, and is exclusive to the PC version of the game.

==Influence==
&quot;Football Manager&quot; has been recognized by real-life football clubs as a source for scouting players. In 2008, Everton F.C. signed a deal with Sports Interactive allowing them to use the game&#x27;s database to scout players and opposition. A video documentary entitled &quot;Football Manager: More Than Just A Game&quot; was produced by journalism graduate and MA student Stephen Milnes and released in October 2010. Another documentary by FilmNova entitled &quot;An Alternative Reality: The Football Manager Documentary&quot; was released in the UK cinemas in October 2014 followed by a release on Steam in March 2015.

&quot;Football Manager&quot; celebrated its twentieth birthday in the summer of 2012, and to celebrate this milestone Back Page Press released a book including interviews with the creators and players that became legends in-game. Another part of the book included stories about how the game has taken over one&#x27;s life. In November 2012, Azerbaijani student Vugar Huseynzade was promoted to manager of FC Baku&#x27;s reserve team based on his success in &quot;Football Manager&quot;. In 2013, stand-up comedian Tony Jameson performed a show called &quot;Football Manager Ruined My Life&quot;; it was well received at the Edinburgh Festival, before going on to have a successful touring run, culminating in the show being filmed and released on DVD and Steam.

In the 2000s, an anonymous player of &quot;Football Manager&quot; tipped the Philippine Football Federation regarding the eligibility of Phil and James Younghusband to play for the Philippines men&#x27;s national football team through the video game. In 2005, the brothers who were then part of the Chelsea youth program were successfully called up to the national team. Phil Younghusband would later become the top goalscorer for the Philippines with at least 50 goals credited to his name.

In 2020, a part-time &quot;Football Manager&quot; researcher discovered Blackburn Rovers forward Ben Brereton was half-Chilean via a club interview from 2018, and added Brereton&#x27;s second nationality to the game database. Brereton would regularly be called up by the Chile national football team in the &quot;Football Manager 2021&quot; game, which prompted interest from a Chilean &quot;Football Manager&quot; streamer. Brereton received encouragement from Chile head coach Reinaldo Rueda and began the application process for a Chilean passport. Martín Lasarte, who succeeded Rueda in February 2021, called up the Rovers forward for the first time in May 2021. He was an unused substitute in Chile&#x27;s two 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification fixtures in June before making his debut as a substitute in the Copa América against Argentina.

Belgian manager Will Still credits the game as part of his influence to become a manager whilst playing for Sint-Truidense V.V.&#x27;s youth set up, before taking up assistant roles with Preston North End, Lierse, and eventually becoming manager of Beerschot, leading them to a 9th place finish in First Division A. Still took over the role of manager of French Ligue 1 side Stade de Reims, which became notable in the news due to the fact Still had yet to receive his UEFA Pro License, a requirement for the French top division, resulting in a £22,000 fine for each game Still manages.

In late 2023, &quot;Football Manager&quot; launched a campaign with McCann London and Microsoft to give a &quot;Football Manager 2024&quot; console player the chance to work for Vanarama National League club Bromley F.C. Nathan Owolabi was given the position of Support Tactician at Bromley and his journey was documented by broadcaster TNT Sports. In June 2024, FIFA announced that its FIFAe World Cup esports tournament series would feature a &quot;Football Manager&quot; tournament, known as the &quot;FIFAe World Cup of Football Manager&quot;. This tournament would feature a US$100,000 prize pool.

==&quot;Football Manager&quot; in academic work== 
&quot;Football Manager&quot; has been the object of a sociological study where it is concluded that not only football culture is essential to fully live the gaming experience but also gamers build their sporting identity by playing the game. Other media like films are described as providing only restrictive narratives to the sports fans while in contrast, sports video games in general and &quot;Football Manager&quot; in particular provide more fluid narratives, and a wealth of information that helps construct the identity of the football fan, beyond sport itself.

The &quot;Football Manager&quot; gaming online community has been studied as a workforce to co-construct the crowdsourced database of football players that the game relies on to simulate football matches and careers. The mutual influence of the game and real life football is described as twofold. First, database players simulated potential and real life transfer market activity are mutually shaping each other. The other mutual influence highlighted are the real life football and game metrics that quantify and measure the footballing activity.

<text>Hannibal Gisco (, ; –258BC) was a Carthaginian military commander in charge of both land armies and naval fleets during the First Punic War against Rome. His efforts proved ultimately unsuccessful and his eventual defeat in battle led to his downfall and execution.

==Life and career==
The details of Hannibal Gisco&#x27;s early life and career are unknown.

===Agrigentum===

Hannibal Gisco&#x27;s first appearance in the sources is in 262 BC, as the general in command of the garrison besieged by the Romans in Agrigentum. Despite the tenacity shown by Gisco and his men for months and the arrival of reinforcements led by Hanno, the city eventually fell into Roman hands. Gisco managed to escape to Carthage in the late stages of the battle.

===The Straits of Messina===
Apparently, the defeat at Agrigentum did not bar Gisco from continuing leadership. In the following year, 260 BC, Gisco returned as the admiral in charge of the Carthaginian fleet in the Straits of Messina. The Romans were about to launch their first-ever navy, and Carthage had determined that this innovation should be thwarted. Gisco defeated and captured the Roman consul Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina in the Lipari encounter, which earned Scipio the nickname Asina (&quot;Donkey&quot;). However, this victory was robbed of practical meaning with the bulk of the Roman fleet continuing to maneuver in the surrounding waters.

===Mylae===
Later in 260 BC, Gisco was to engage this fleet and to be the first Punic general to encounter the Roman &quot;corvus&quot; boarding device with its deadly effect. Confident in Carthage&#x27;s superiority at sea, Gisco deployed his ships for the Battle of Mylae in the traditional long line arrangement. Although inexperienced in sea battle, the Romans, led by consul Gaius Duilius, heavily defeated the Carthaginian fleet, mainly due to the innovative use of land tactics in naval warfare.

Hannibal was recalled, but his fall from favor did not last long. In 258, he was sent to Sardinia, which he had to defend against the Romans. However, he was no match for the Roman commander Gaius Sulpicius Paterculus, who defeated him at the Battle of Sulci.

Having lost the confidence of his peers, Hannibal Gisco was subsequently executed for incompetence shortly afterwards, together with other defeated Punic generals. According to some references he was crucified by his own men.

<text>Gaius Duilius ( 260–231 BC) was a Roman general and statesman. As consul in 260 BC, during the First Punic War, he won Rome&#x27;s first ever victory at sea by defeating the Carthaginians at the Battle of Mylae. He later served as censor in 258, and was appointed dictator to hold elections in 231, but never held another command.

==Background==
Gaius Duilius, whose father and grandfather were both named Marcus Duilius, belonged to an undistinguished family. One Caeso Duilius is recorded as consul in 336 BC, but the surname is otherwise only known historically and reliably from a few minor magistrates in the fourth century BC.

==Career==
===Naval victory===
Duilius was one of the consuls for the year 260 BC, and was initially appointed to command Rome&#x27;s land forces in Sicily against Carthage, as part of the First Punic War. His colleague in office, Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio, held charge of the fleet. The Romans built 120 warships and despatched them to Sicily in 260 BC for their crews to carry out basic training. Scipio sailed with the first 17 ships to arrive to the Lipari Islands, a little way off the north-east coast of Sicily, in an attempt to seize the islands&#x27; main port, Lipara. The Carthaginian fleet was commanded by Hannibal Gisco and was based at Panormus, some from Lipara. When Hannibal heard of the Romans&#x27; move he despatched 20 ships. When these attacked, Scipio&#x27;s inexperienced men offered little resistance and the consul himself was taken prisoner. All of the Roman ships were captured, most with little damage. This forced Duilius to hand over the legions to the tribunes and assume control of the Roman fleet himself. A little later, Hannibal was scouting with 50 Carthaginian ships when he encountered the full Roman fleet. He escaped, but lost most of his ships. 

Manoeuvring galleys at sea required long and arduous training. As a result, the Romans were at a disadvantage against the more experienced Carthaginians. To counter this, the Romans introduced the &quot;corvus&quot;, a bridge wide and long, with a heavy spike on the underside of the free end, which was designed to pierce and anchor into an enemy ship&#x27;s deck. This allowed Roman legionaries acting as marines to board enemy ships and capture them, rather than employing the previously traditional tactic of ramming.

Duilius, hearing that a Carthaginian squadron under Hannibal Gisco was attacking Mylae, promptly sailed, seeking battle. The two fleets met off the coast of Mylae in the Battle of Mylae. Hannibal had 130 ships, and the historian John Lazenby calculates that Duilius had approximately the same number. The Carthaginians anticipated victory, due to the superior experience of their crews, and their faster and more manoeuvrable galleys, and broke formation to close rapidly with the Romans. The first 30 Carthaginian ships were grappled by the and successfully boarded by the Romans, including Hannibal&#x27;s ship – he escaped in a skiff. Seeing this, the remaining Carthaginians swung wide, attempting to take the Romans in the sides or rear. The Romans successfully countered and captured a further 20 Carthaginian vessels. The surviving Carthaginians broke off the action, and being faster than the Romans were able to escape. This clash was Rome&#x27;s first ever naval victory. Duilius sailed to relieve the Roman-held city of Segesta, which had been under siege.

===Further successes===
Following his victory at sea, Duilius resumed his command of the legions in Sicily. Landing probably at the gulf of Termini, he relieved Segesta of its siege by the Carthaginian Hamilcar, and then stormed the fortress of Macella (possibly Macellaro near Camporeale). As his term as consul neared its end, Duilius returned to Rome to hold elections and to celebrate, in early 259, the first Roman triumph for a naval victory. With part of the spoils, Duilius built a temple to Janus at the Forum Holitorium, and a column adorned with the ramming beaks () of captured warships was erected in the Forum to celebrate his victory. He was also accorded the special honour of being accompanied by a torchbearer and flute-player while returning home from dinner at night.

Duilius went on to hold the office of censor in 258–257, and was later, in 231, appointed dictator to hold elections. He was said to have lived to old age, and Cato the Censor may have claimed to have seen the aged Duilius during his own childhood. Despite this, Duilius never held another military command, though he may have participated in a raid on Africa in 247. Lazenby suggested that, since he lacked an aristocratic pedigree, the nobility &quot;may have got tired of his boastfulness&quot;, if the tone of the commemorative inscription attached to his column () reflects his own attitude.

===Legacy===

In the Twentieth Century, the Italian Navy named several warships after Duilius, including the battleship .

Due to Duilius&#x27; victory being commemorated with a column adorned with the ramming beaks () of captured warships being erected in the Forum, behind where speakers were standing when delivering a speech, the word &quot;&quot; gained in Latin - and thence to various modern languages - the meaning of referring to a dais.

<text>Primary aldosteronism (PA)&quot;,&quot; also known as primary hyperaldosteronism, refers to the excess production of the hormone aldosterone from the adrenal glands, resulting in low renin levels and high blood pressure. This abnormality is a paraneoplastic syndrome (i.e. caused by hyperplasia or tumors). About 35% of the cases are caused by a single aldosterone-secreting adenoma, a condition known as Conn&#x27;s syndrome.

Many patients experience fatigue, potassium deficiency and high blood pressure which may cause poor vision, confusion or headaches. Symptoms may also include: muscular aches and weakness, muscle spasms, low back and flank pain from the kidneys, trembling, tingling sensations, dizziness/vertigo, nocturia and excessive urination. Complications include cardiovascular disease such as stroke, myocardial infarction, kidney failure and abnormal heart rhythms.
Primary hyperaldosteronism has a number of causes. About 33% of cases are due to an adrenal adenoma that produces aldosterone, and 66% of cases are due to an enlargement of both adrenal glands. Other uncommon causes include adrenal cancer and an inherited disorder called familial hyperaldosteronism. PA is underdiagnosed; the Endocrine Society recommends screening people with high blood pressure who are at increased risk, while others recommend screening all people with high blood pressure for the disease. Screening is usually done by measuring the aldosterone-to-renin ratio in the blood (ARR) whilst off interfering medications and a serum potassium over 4, with further testing used to confirm positive results. While low blood potassium is classically described in primary hyperaldosteronism, this is only present in about a quarter of people. To determine the underlying cause, medical imaging is carried out.
Some cases may be cured by removing the adenoma by surgery after localization with adrenal venous sampling (AVS). A single adrenal gland may also be removed in cases where only one is enlarged. In cases due to enlargement of both glands, treatment is typically with medications known as aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone or eplerenone. Other medications for high blood pressure and a low salt diet, e.g. DASH diet, may also be needed. Some people with familial hyperaldosteronism may be treated with the steroid dexamethasone.
Primary aldosteronism is present in about 10% of people with high blood pressure. It occurs more often in women than men. Often, it begins in those between 30 and 50 years of age. Conn&#x27;s syndrome is named after Jerome W. Conn (1907–1994), an American endocrinologist who first described adenomas as a cause of the condition in 1955.

==Signs and symptoms==
People often have few or no symptoms. They may get occasional muscular weakness, muscle spasms, tingling sensations, or excessive urination.High blood pressure, manifestations of muscle cramps (due to hyperexcitability of neurons secondary to low blood calcium), muscle weakness (due to hypoexcitability of skeletal muscles secondary to hypokalemia), and headaches (due to low blood potassium or high blood pressure) may be seen.

Secondary hyperaldosteronism is often related to decreased cardiac output, which is associated with elevated renin levels.

==Causes==

The condition is due to:
* Bilateral idiopathic (micronodular) adrenal hyperplasia: 66% of cases
* Adrenal adenoma (Conn&#x27;s disease): 33% of cases
* Primary (unilateral) adrenal hyperplasia: 2% of cases
* Aldosterone-producing adrenocortical carcinoma: &lt;1% of cases
* Familial Hyperaldosteronism (FH)
** Glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (FH type I): &lt;1% of cases
** FH type II (APA or IHA): &lt;2% of cases
* Ectopic aldosterone-producing adenoma or carcinoma: &lt; 0.1% of cases

===Genetics===
40% of people with an adrenal aldosterone producing adenoma have somatic gain-of-function mutations in a single gene (KCNJ5). This gene is mutated in inherited cases of early onset primary aldosteronism and bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, albeit less frequently. These mutations tend to occur in young women with the adenoma in the cortisol secreting zona fasciculata. Adenomas without this mutation tend to occur in older men with resistant hypertension.

Other genes commonly mutated in aldosterone producing adenomas are ATP1A1 ATP2B3, CACNA1D, and CTNNB1.

==Pathophysiology==
Aldosterone has effects on most or all cells of the body but, clinically, the most important actions are in the kidney, on cells of the late distal convoluted tubule and medullary collecting duct. In the principal cells aldosterone increases activity of basolateral membrane sodium-potassium ATPase and apical epithelial sodium channels, ENaC, as well as potassium channels, ROMK. These actions increase sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion. Since more sodium is reabsorbed than potassium secreted, it also makes the lumen more electrically negative, causing chloride to follow sodium. Water then follows sodium and chloride by osmosis. In Conn syndrome, these actions cause increased extracellular sodium and fluid volume and reduced extracellular potassium. Aldosterone also acts on intercalated cells to stimulate an apical proton ATPase, causing proton secretion that acidifies urine and alkalizes extracellular fluid.

In summary, hyperaldosteronism causes hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis.

Finer notes on aldosterone include the fact that it stimulates sodium-potassium ATPase in muscle cells, increasing intracellular potassium and also increases sodium reabsorption all along the intestine and nephron, possibly due to widespread stimulation of sodium-potassium ATPase. Finally, epithelial cells of sweat gland ducts and distal colon surface respond exactly the same as the principal cells of the nephron. These responses are important in climate adaptation and as a cause of constipation with elevated aldosterone.

The sodium retention leads to plasma volume expansion and elevated blood pressure. The increased blood pressure will lead to increased glomerular filtration rate and cause a decrease in renin released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidney decreasing sodium reabsorption and returning sodium renal excretion to near normal levels allowing sodium to &#x27;escape&#x27; the effect of mineralocorticoids (also known as aldosterone escape mechanism in primary hyperaldosteronism also contributed to by increased ANP level). If there is primary hyperaldosteronism, the decreased renin (and subsequent decreased angiotensin II) will not lead to a decrease in aldosterone levels (a very helpful clinical tool in diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism).

==Diagnosis==
Screening may be considered in people with high blood pressure presenting with low blood potassium, high blood pressure that is difficult to treat, other family members with the same condition, or a mass on the adrenal gland.

Measuring aldosterone alone is not considered adequate to diagnose primary hyperaldosteronism. Rather, both renin and aldosterone are measured, and a resultant aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) is used for case detection. A high aldosterone-to-renin ratio suggests the presence of primary hyperaldosteronism. The diagnosis is made by performing a saline suppression test, ambulatory salt loading test, or fludrocortisone suppression test.

Measuring sodium and potassium concentrations simultaneously in serum and urine specimens has been suggested for screening purposes. Calculating the serum sodium over urinary sodium to serum potassium over urinary potassium (SUSPUP) and the (serum sodium to urinary sodium to (serum potassium)2 (SUSPPUP) ratios delivers calculated structure parameters of the RAAS, which may be used as a static function test. Its results have to be confirmed by calculating the ARR.

If primary hyperaldosteronism is confirmed biochemically, CT scanning or other cross-sectional imaging can confirm the presence of an adrenal abnormality, possibly an adrenal cortical adenoma (aldosteronoma), adrenal carcinoma, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, or other less common changes. Imaging findings may ultimately lead to other necessary diagnostic studies, such as adrenal venous sampling, to clarify the cause. It is not uncommon for adults to have bilateral sources of aldosterone hypersecretion in the presence of a nonfunctioning adrenal cortical adenoma, making adrenal venous sampling (AVS) mandatory in cases where surgery is being considered. For cases where AVS is unable to provide lateralisation of the source/sources of aldosterone hypersecretion, radionuclide imaging such as NP-59 scintigraphy, or PET/CT with 11C-Metomidate is an option. Since 11C-Metomidate is unspecific for CYP11B1/CYP11B2 the patient needs pre-treatment with dexamethasone to downregulate the expression of CYP11B1.

The diagnosis is best accomplished by an appropriately-trained subspecialist, though primary care providers are critical in recognizing clinical features of primary aldosteronism and obtaining the first blood tests for case detection.

===Classification===
Some people only use Conn&#x27;s syndrome for when it occurs due to an adrenal adenoma (a type of benign tumor). In practice, however, the terms are often used interchangeably, regardless of the underlying physiology.

===Differential diagnosis===
Other causes of treatment-resistant hypertension include renal artery stenosis, secondary hyperaldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, deoxycorticosterone- or renin-secreting tumors, and kidney ischemia. Excess consumption of licorice can inhibit 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and cause similar symptoms as PA. Chrétien syndrome, Gitelman syndrome, and Liddle syndrome can cause secondary aldosteronism or pseudohyperaldosteronism.

==Treatment==
The treatment for hyperaldosteronism depends on the underlying cause. In people with a single benign tumor (adenoma), surgical removal (adrenalectomy) may be curative. This is usually performed laparoscopically, through several very small incisions. For people with hyperplasia of both glands, successful treatment is often achieved with spironolactone or eplerenone, drugs that block the aldosterone receptor. With its antiandrogen effect, spironolactone drug therapy may have a range of side effects in males and females, including gynecomastia and irregular menses. These symptoms occur less frequently with eplerenone drug therapy.

In the absence of treatment, individuals with hyperaldosteronism often have poorly controlled high blood pressure, which may be associated with increased rates of stroke, heart disease, and kidney failure. With appropriate treatment, the prognosis is considered good.

Esaxerenone, the first non-steroidal mineralocorticoid blocker, was approved in 2019 in Japan to treat essential hypertension. Finerenone, a drug belonging to the same class, reached phase 3 clinical trial in 2020, but is not yet considered for hypertension. More importantly, next-generation Aldosterone Synthase Inhibitors have entered the research pipeline with CIN-107 undergoing Phase 2 clinical trial as of 2021
== Epidemiology ==
In the past, the prevalence of primary aldosteronism was considered to be less than 1% of patients with hypertension. More recent studies have reported much higher prevalence of primary aldosteronism, up-to 12.7% in primary care and to 29.8% in referral centers. Very low rates of compliance with screening guidelines lead to the underdiagnoses of primary aldosteronism.

== Society and culture ==
The Primary Aldosteronism Foundation is a patient-driven initiative committed to creating the paradigm shift that will lead to optimum diagnosis and treatment of primary aldosteronism by raising awareness, fostering research, and providing support to patients and healthcare professionals worldwide.

==Eponym==
Conn&#x27;s syndrome is named after Jerome W. Conn (1907–1994), the American endocrinologist who first described the condition at the University of Michigan in 1955.

<text>Jane Davidson (born 19 March 1957) is a Welsh former Labour politician, the former Assembly Member for Pontypridd, and served as minister for environment, sustainability and housing in the Welsh Government. She also previously served as the Welsh vice-president of the Ramblers&#x27; Association, stepping down when appointed minister for environment, sustainability and housing in 2007. She announced in 2008 that she would not be seeking re-election to the assembly in 2011.

== Professional career ==
Prior to her election to the Welsh Assembly Davidson was a member of Cardiff City Council. In the Assembly she was minister for environment and sustainability in Wales from 2007 to 2011 where she was responsible for the Welsh Government agreeing to make sustainable development its central organising principle. Prior to that she was minister for education and lifelong learning where she introduced a new foundation phase for 3- to 7-year-olds, the Welsh Baccalaureate and Education for Sustainable Development and Global Citizenship (ESDGC) into the Welsh curriculum.

In 2011, following her ministerial career and subsequent move to West Wales as planned, Davidson took up employment as director of the Wales Institute for Sustainability at the local Trinity St David University shortly afterwards, which intends to introduce sustainability content into every student&#x27;s experience from 2013.

<text>Drepana () was an Elymian, Carthaginian, and Roman port in antiquity on the western coast of Sicily. It was the site of a crushing Roman defeat by the Carthaginians in 249BC. It eventually developed into the modern Italian city of Trapani.

==Name==
Drepana received its name from &quot;drépanon&quot; (), the Greek word for &quot;sickle&quot;, because of the curving shape of its harbour. This was Latinized as Drepanum before being pluralized to its present form.

==History==

The town was founded by the Elymians to serve as the port of the nearby city of Eryx (present-day Erice), which overlooks it from Monte Erice. The city sits on a low-lying promontory jutting out into the Mediterranean Sea. The town, north of Lilybaeum, had been fortified by the Carthaginians, who resettled part of the population to Eryx. In 241, it was besieged by G. Lutatius Catulus, and later used as a naval base.

The town features in the &quot;Aeneid&quot; as the site of the death and funeral games of Anchises.

Carthage seized control of the city in 260BC, subsequently making it an important naval base. The naval battle of Drepanum took place in 249BC and was a major victory for Carthage against the Roman Republic in the First Punic War. After the Battle of the Aegates and Carthage&#x27;s loss of the war, the town was ceded to Roman control in 241BC.

It never achieved the status of a civitas in Roman times.

<doc id="465863" wikidata="Q448310" url="?curid=465863" title="Seborrhoeic dermatitis">
<text>Seborrhoeic dermatitis (also spelt seborrheic dermatitis in American English) is a long-term skin disorder. Symptoms include flaky, scaly, greasy, and occasionally itchy and inflamed skin. Areas of the skin rich in oil-producing glands are often affected including the scalp, face, and chest. It can result in social or self-esteem problems. In babies, when the scalp is primarily involved, it is called cradle cap. Mild seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp may be described in lay terms as dandruff due to the dry, flaky character of the skin. However, as dandruff may refer to any dryness or scaling of the scalp, not all dandruff is seborrhoeic dermatitis. Seborrhoeic dermatitis is sometimes inaccurately referred to as seborrhoea.
The cause is unclear but believed to involve a number of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors for seborrhoeic dermatitis include poor immune function, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and alcoholic pancreatitis. The condition may worsen with stress or during the winter. &quot;Malassezia&quot; yeast is believed to play a role. It is not a result of poor hygiene. Diagnosis is typically clinical and based on the symptoms present. The condition is not contagious.
The typical treatment is topical antifungal cream and anti-inflammatory agents. Specifically, ketoconazole or ciclopirox are effective. Seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp is often treated with shampoo preparations of ketoconazole zinc pyrithione, and selenium, although the latter has been partly discontinued due to concerns of selenium in higher concentrations being carcinogenic. 
The condition is common in infants within the first three months of age or in adults aged 30 to 70 years. It tends to affect more males. Seborrhoeic dermatitis is more common in African Americans, among individuals who are immune compromised, such as with HIV, and individuals with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.
==Signs and symptoms==


Seborrhoeic dermatitis typically appears as dry, white, flaky skin. The flakes can be fine, loose, and diffuse or thick and adherent. Additionally, flakes can appear yellow and oily or greasy. In addition to flaky skin, seborrhoeic dermatitis can have areas of red, inflamed, and itchy skin that coincide with the area of skin flaking, but not all individuals have this symptom. 

Seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp can appear similarly to dandruff. When the scalp is affected, there can be associated temporary hair loss. Such hair loss varies in appearance from diffuse thinning to patchy areas of hair loss. On close inspection, the locations where hair has thinned may have broken stubs of hair and pustules around the hair follicles. Individuals with more pigmented skin tones may experience increased or decreased skin pigmentation in affected areas.

Various locations can be affected by seborrhoeic dermatitis. Commonly affected areas include the face, ears, scalp, and across the body. It is less common in intertriginous areas, which are areas where the skin folds and comes into contact with itself, such as the groin or underarm.

Seborrhoeic dermatitis&#x27; symptoms are typically mild and appear gradually but are often persistent, lasting weeks to years. Individuals with seborrhoeic dermatitis are subject to recurrent bouts and it may be a lifelong condition. Seborrhoeic dermatitis can also occur quickly and severely in patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). In fact, this is sometimes the first indication of HIV.

==Causes==
The cause of seborrhoeic dermatitis has not been fully clarified.

In addition to the presence of &quot;Malassezia&quot;, genetic, environmental, hormonal, and immune-system factors are necessary for and/or modulate the expression of seborrhoeic dermatitis. The condition may be aggravated by illness, psychological stress, fatigue, sleep deprivation, change of season, and reduced general health.

===Fungi===
The condition is thought to be due to a local inflammatory response to overgrowth by &quot;Malassezia&quot; fungi species in sebum-producing skin areas including the scalp, face, chest, back, underarms, and groin. This is based on observations of high counts of &quot;Malassezia&quot; species in skin affected by seborrhoeic dermatitis and on the effectiveness of antifungals in treating the condition. Species of &quot;Malassezia&quot; implicated in Seborrhoeic dermatitis include &quot;M. furfur&quot; (formerly &quot;Pityrosporum ovale&quot;), &quot;M. globosa&quot;, &quot;M. restricta&quot;, &quot;M. sympodialis&quot;, and &quot;M. slooffiae&quot;.

&quot;Malassezia&quot; appears to be the significant factor in seborrhoeic dermatitis but it is thought that other factors are necessary for the presence of &quot;Malassezia&quot; to result in the seborrhoeic dermatitis. For example, summer growth of &quot;Malassezia&quot; in the skin alone does not result in seborrhoeic dermatitis. Besides antifungals, the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory drugs, which reduce inflammation, and antiandrogens, which reduce sebum production, provide further insights into the pathophysiology of seborrhoeic dermatitis.

=== Bacteria ===
Several bacteria, including Propionibacterium species and Staphylococcus aureus, have been shown to have some level of interaction with seborrhoeic dermatitis, though their exact impact is not known.

=== Nutrition ===
Seborrhoeic dermatitis-like eruptions are also associated with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and riboflavin (vitamin B2) deficiency. In children and babies, issues with Δ6-desaturase enzymes have been correlated with increased risk.

=== Immune dysfunction ===
Those with immunodeficiency (especially infection with HIV) and with neurological disorders that may impact immune system function such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease (for which the condition is an autonomic sign) and stroke are particularly prone to it.

===Climate===
Climate can affect seborrheic dermatitis, but there is a lack of consensus about which climates tend to exacerbate seborrheic dermatitis the most. Some studies show low humidity and low temperature are responsible for high frequency of seborrheic dermatitis. Others suggest hot environments may also worsen seborrhoeic dermatitis. Yet another described that high humidity and low UV exposure are culpable. Dry skin and an impaired skin barrier contribute to the condition. It is likely that climate and weather variations affect the water and lipid content of skin.

== Mechanism ==
Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a complex condition with many interacting factors that are not yet fully explained. In general, the major factors that influence the development and severity include &quot;Malassezia&quot; yeast presents on and in the skin, skin production of oily sebum, and a subsequent inflammatory response against &quot;Malassezia&quot; and their byproducts. Additional factors involved in the condition are a compromised skin barrier, the makeup and amount of sebum produced, the character of the immune response and inflammation, and the presence of other microbes species inhabiting the skin. 

A suggested series of events leading to seborrhoeic dermatitis are initial damaged skin barrier and abnormal sebum production which leads to a change in the microbiome of the skin that in turn elicits an immune response. An alternative explanation is an increase in sebum production feeding an increase in the &quot;Malassezia&quot; population that instigates inflammation; the inflammation then causes cellular changes that damage the skin barrier. This barrier disruption then encourages additional &quot;Malassezia&quot; growth and inflammation and again worsened skin barrier function.

== Diagnosis ==

Typically, seborrhoeic dermatitis is a clinical diagnosis based on a physician&#x27;s expertise in identifying and differentiating skin conditions based on the history of the individual and the appearance of the skin. However, seborrhoeic dermatitis may also be diagnosed with additional testing. The least invasive test is a visual inspection in the clinic using a Wood&#x27;s Lamp. A KOH test can also be used, where skin scraping of the affected skin may also be taken and prepared with potassium hydroxide (KOH) and visualized under a microscope to look for &quot;Malassezia&quot; or other microbiological cells. Additionally, a fungal culture of the affected skin may be taken to attempt to grow and identify the causative organism.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Seborrhoeic dermatitis can look similar to other skin conditions that share its characteristic dry, flaky, scaly, and inflamed appearance but have different causes and treatments. Physicians use the history of the individual with the skin condition as well as other tests to identify which disorder is present. Other conditions that may be confused with seborrhoeic dermatitis based on appearance are listed below.
* Atopic dermatitis (eczema)
* Contact dermatitis
* Psoriasis
* Tinea capitis and tinea corporis
* Candidiasis
* Tinea versicolor
* Pityriasis rosea
* Impetigo
* Drug reaction
* Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma

==Management==

===Medications===
A variety of different types of medications are able to reduce symptoms of seborrhoeic dermatitis. These include certain antifungals, anti-inflammatory agents like corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiandrogens, and antihistamines, among others. Treatments must take into consideration potential side effects, especially with long-term use given the chronic nature of seborrhoeic dermatitis. Initial therapy is usually a topical preparation with an agreeable side effect profile.

====Antifungals====
Regular use of an over-the-counter or prescription antifungal shampoo or cream is a common treatment. The topical antifungal medications ketoconazole and ciclopirox have the best evidence. Ketoconazole should be used twice per week. Shampoo or soap containing zinc pyrithione or selenium disulfide is also used. These options should be used on a daily basis but may also be used in conjunction with a ketoconazole shampoo regimen on alternate days. It is unclear if other antifungals are equally effective as this has not been sufficiently studied. Antifungals that have been studied and found to be effective in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis include ketoconazole, fluconazole, miconazole, bifonazole, sertaconazole, clotrimazole, flutrimazole, ciclopirox, terbinafine, butenafine, selenium disulfide, and lithium salts such as lithium gluconate and lithium succinate. 

Topical climbazole appears to have little effectiveness in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis. Systemic therapy with oral antifungals including itraconazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole is effective, but adverse side effects have been documented for fluconazole and ketoconazole, with the latter not recommended for use, while itraconazole, with its good safety profile, is the most commonly prescribed. Terbinafine is said to be effective, but with adverse side effects, while other sources state it is not effective and should not be used.

====Anti-inflammatory treatments====
Topical corticosteroids have been shown to be effective in short-term treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis and are as effective or more effective than antifungal treatment with azoles. These sometimes are used for only a few weeks at a time. There is also evidence for the effectiveness of topical calcineurin inhibitors like tacrolimus and pimecrolimus as well as lithium salt therapy. Calcineurin inhibitors were also effective in reducing growth of Malassezia, offering two routes by which they may treat seborrhoeic dermatitis. Medications such as the calcineurin inhibitors should not be used in individuals with seborrhoeic dermatitis who are immune compromised because they cause further immune suppression.

Oral immunosuppressive treatment, such as with prednisone, has been used in short courses for seborrhoeic dermatitis, as a last resort due to its potential side effects.

====Antihistamines====
Antihistamines are used primarily to reduce itching, if present. However, research studies suggest that some antihistamines have anti-inflammatory properties.

====Keratolytics====

Keratolytics help the skin via exfoliation built-up skin flakes and thereby remove scale. They are applied topically to the affected area. Keratolytics include urea, salicylic acid, coal tar, lactic acid, pyrithione zinc and propylene glycol. Coal tar shampoo formulations can be effective. Although no significant increased risk of cancer in human treatment with coal tar shampoos has been found, caution is advised since coal tar is carcinogenic in animals, and heavy human occupational exposures do increase cancer risks.

====Other treatments====
* Isotretinoin, a sebosuppressive agent, may be used to reduce sebaceous gland activity as a last resort in refractory disease. However, isotretinoin has potentially serious side effects, and few patients with seborrhoeic dermatitis are appropriate candidates for therapy.
* Topical 0.75% and 1% Metronidazole
* Topical 4% nicotinamide
* Topical sulfacetamide
* Tea tree oil
* Cannabidiol shampoo
* Frequent washing to avoid the build-up of scale, especially on the scalp, but while avoiding overly drying the skin
* Avoiding damaging skin with harsh grooming or chemical irritants
* Bicalutamide, an antiandrogen, has been observed in one patient to have potentially been the cause of seborrheic dermatitis relief. However, even if it were demonstrated that bicalutamide or any other antiandrogen is a treatment, it is not recommended due to side effects and price.

===Phototherapy===

Another option is natural and artificial UV radiation since it can inhibit the growth of &quot;Malassezia&quot; yeast. Some recommend photodynamic therapy using UV-A and UV-B laser or red and blue LED light to inhibit the growth of &quot;Malassezia&quot; fungus and reduce seborrhoeic inflammation.

== Outcome ==
Seborrhoeic dermatitis is generally a chronic and recurring condition. Individuals may have the condition for several weeks to months, but it may also last years or their lifetime. There may be periods of relapse and worsening.

==Epidemiology==
Seborrhoeic dermatitis affects 1 to 5% of the general population. It is slightly more common in men, but affected women tend to have more severe symptoms. The condition usually recurs throughout a person&#x27;s lifetime. Seborrhoeic dermatitis can occur in any age group but often occurs during the first three months of life then again at puberty and peaks in incidence at around 40 years of age. It can reportedly affect as many as 31% of older people. Infants may also have this condition, though it is typically milder, and is referred to as cradle cap. Seborrhoeic dermatitis is more common in African-Americans.

Severity is worse in dry climates as well as hot weather as dry skin can exacerbate the condition. COVID-19 related mask usage may also cause or exacerbate facial seborrhoeic dermatitis.

Individuals who are immune compromised have increased risk of seborrhoeic dermatitis. Conditions that are associated with increased rates of seborrhoeic dermatitis include individuals with HIV, Hepatitis C, alcoholic pancreatitis, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and alcohol abuse. Seborrhoeic dermatitis is common in people with alcoholism, between 7 and 11 percent, which is twice the normal expected occurrence.

<text>Publius Claudius Pulcher (died 249 BC or 246 BC) was a Roman politician.

==Family==
Pulcher was the son of Appius Claudius Caecus. He was the first of the Claudii to be given the cognomen &quot;Pulcher&quot; (&quot;handsome&quot;). He was also the father of Appius Claudius Pulcher, consul in 212 BC.

After losing the Battle of Drepana, his sister Claudia was prosecuted for insulting the Plebs. Whilst travelling through the streets of Rome, the path that her carriage was taking had been blocked by a crowd. She was then heard to have wished her brother would lose another battle and drown some more of the poorer citizens.

==Career==
Curule aedile in 253 BC, as consul in 249 he was given command of the Roman fleet during the First Punic War. He lost the Battle of Drepana against the Carthaginians after ignoring a bad omen, in which 93 of his 123 ships, as well as over 20,000 sailors, were lost. According to Valerius Maximus, Suetonius and Cicero, when the sacred chickens refused to eat, Claudius threw them into the sea, reportedly saying: &quot;Since they do not wish to eat, let them drink!&quot; (Latin &quot;Quia edere nolunt, bibent!&quot;, ). He was recalled to Rome and ordered to appoint a dictator; his nomination of his subordinate Marcus Claudius Glicia was overruled. He was tried for incompetence and impiety, avoiding capital or corporal punishment due to double jeopardy and was instead fined 120,000 assēs, 1,000 for each ship Rome had lost in the battle against Carthage. He died soon afterwards, potentially by suicide.

<text>San Miguel Corporation (), abbreviated as SMC, is a Philippine multinational conglomerate with headquarters in Mandaluyong, Metro Manila. The company is one of the largest and most diversified conglomerates in the Philippines. Originally founded in 1890 as a brewery, San Miguel has ventured beyond its core business, with investments in various sectors such as food and drink, finance, infrastructure, oil and energy, transportation, and real estate.

Its flagship product, San Miguel Beer, is one of the best selling beers in the world. San Miguel&#x27;s manufacturing operations have extended beyond its home market to areas such as Hong Kong, China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, and Australia. In total, its products are exported to 60 markets around the world.

==History==
In 1889, a Manila businessman, Enrique María Barretto de Ycaza y Esteban, applied for a royal grant from Spain to establish a brewery in the Philippines. He was awarded the grant for a period of twenty years. On September 29, 1890 (Michaelmas, or the feast day of Saint Michael the Archangel), &quot;La Fábrica de Cerveza San Miguel&quot; was opened. Located at 6 Calzada de Malacañan (later renamed Calle conde de Avilés and presently Jose Laurel Street), the brewery took its name from the &quot;arrabal&quot; (suburb or district) where it was located, San Miguel, Manila. The facility had two sections: one devoted to the production of ice with a daily capacity of 5 tons, and the other to beer production. The brewery was the first in Southeast Asia to use modern equipment and facilities. With 70 employees, the plant produced 3,600 hectolitres (about 47,000 cases) of lager beer during the first year and subsequently produced other types of beer, notably Cerveza Negra, Eagle Extra Stout and Doble Bock.

Early success led to the expansion of the business and Barretto decided to incorporate his brewery. On June 6, 1893, the company was incorporated and registered with a capital of P180,000. Those forming the corporation were Barretto, Pedro Pablo Róxas y Castro (an ancestor of the Zobel de Ayala family), Gonzalo Tuasón y Patiño, Vicente D. Fernández y Castro, Albino Goyenechea, Benito Legarda y Tuáson and the heirs of Don Mariano Buenaventura y Chuidan.

Pedro Pablo Róxas was appointed manager, playing a prominent role in the development of the firm. He was the most active member of the firm until 1896, when he left for Europe. Prior to his departure, he acquired some of Barretto&#x27;s shares in the company worth ₱42,000. After Barretto retired in May 1896, Róxas acquired the rest of Barretto&#x27;s stake in the business. In 1895, San Miguel Beer won its first award as a product of the highest quality at the Exposición Regional de Filipinas. By 1896, San Miguel Beer was outselling by more than five-to-one all imported beers in the country.

The 1900s ushered in a period of prosperity after the Philippine Revolution and the beginning of the American Occupation. Demand for beer increased, so San Miguel, still under Róxas&#x27; leadership, commenced modernization of their operations including installation of electric conveyors and automatic machines. The brewery&#x27;s equipment was fully modernised by 1910.

===Incorporated as San Miguel Brewery, Inc. (1913–1963)===
By 1913, imported beer represented only 12% of the total consumption in the Philippines; San Miguel held an 88% share of the industry. Róxas died in Paris in 1913. Soon after, Benito Legarda and Gonzalo Tuasón made it advisable to change the form of the company from a firm of co-participants to a corporation (San Miguel Brewery, Inc.). Róxas&#x27;s son, Antonio Róxas de Ayala, was appointed president, with Enrique Brías de Coya and Ramón J. Fernández as managers.

By 1914, San Miguel began to export, with its products finding ready markets in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Guam. When the First World War broke out, exports came to a temporary halt due to difficulties such as shortage of raw materials and the consequent rise in manufacturing costs. It was not until Prohibition was repealed in the United States that San Miguel was able to resume exports to Guam and later to Honolulu. By the end of 1914, Enrique Brías, after seeing that his efforts and industry had resulted in a progressive and prosperous business, retired from active business life in favour of his son, Antonio Brías y Róxas. In 1918, Antonio Róxas resigned from his position as president.

====Andrés Soriano Sr.: 1918–1964====
Andrés Soriano (a grandson of Pedro Pablo Róxas and a nephew of Antonio Róxas) joined San Miguel as a clerk in the accounting department. In 1918, after the resignation of Antonio Róxas, Ramón J. Fernández assumed the presidency and Soriano was made acting manager. In 1923, Soriano was appointed manager and managed San Miguel together with Antonio Brías y Róxas with increasing success.

Diversification into new lines of business began in the 1920s. In 1922, the company opened the Royal Soft Drinks Plant in Manila producing Royal Tru, other Royal products and aerated water. (In 1919, the company acquired the Oriental Brewery and Ice Company and transformed the building into an ice plant and cold storage; later the Royal Soft Drinks Plant.). Five years later, the company secured the rights to bottle and distribute Coca-Cola in the Philippines. In 1925, San Miguel went into the ice cream business with the purchase of the Magnolia Plant on Calle Avilés which was transferred a year later to a new site on Calle Echague (now, C. Palanca Sr. Street) in Quiapo District, Manila. This new site used to house the Fábrica de Hielo de Manila was bought by San Miguel in 1924. To achieve greater self-sufficiency in its operations, the firm opened a new plant in 1930 to produce carbon dioxide for its soft drinks products, and dry ice for the refrigeration needs of its ice cream products. In 1932, a plant was set up to produce compressed yeast for bakeries and medical use. The following year, the company leased the Insular Ice Plant from the government for a period of ten years.

During the 1930s, San Miguel began investing in businesses overseas. The company set up a short-lived dairy business in Calcutta, India and Singapore (Cold Storage Creameries, Singapore), and invested in breweries in the United States (a stake in the George Muehlebach Brewing Company and majority holding in the Lone Star Brewing Company located in San Antonio, Texas).

In 1939, the management structure of the company was reorganized to be more like other American corporations. San Miguel&#x27;s management team was made up of the board of directors (president, vice-president, treasurer and nine directors and the executive officers of the corporation). Ramón J. Fernández was elected president of the board of directors and Antonio Róxas y Gargollo (a son of Antonio Róxas) was elected vice-president. Soriano was elected president of the corporation, with Antonio Brías y Róxas as vice president. Eduardo Róxas y Gargollo (another son of Don Antonio Róxas) and Jacobo Zóbel y Róxas were appointed directors. Expanding and modernizing the company, however, required the dilution of family control. San Miguel became the first Filipino company to be jointly owned by many shareholders. To retain control, Soriano relied on alliances with his Róxas relatives and associates.

Before World War II broke out, San Miguel built a glass factory in Paco and the Cebu Royal plant, its first installation outside Luzon. When the war reached the Philippines, Soriano was commissioned as a colonel and served as an aide to General Douglas MacArthur. One of the first Filipino brewmasters was Dominador San Diego Santos, a chemist from Obando, Bulacan.

After the war, San Miguel rebuilt and mounted a large scale expansion program. It acquired and modernized a second brewery in Polo, Bulacán (now part of Valenzuela City) in 1947. Two years later, five other plants were opened: the Farola glass plant and power plant (San Nicolas, Manila), a carbon dioxide plant in Otis Street (Paco, Manila), a carton plant and the Iloílo Coca-Cola plant. Exports of San Miguel Pale Pilsen resumed, and new soft drink plants followed in Davao and Naga.

In 1953, Soriano signed the Manila Agreement which allowed the Spanish company La Segarra S.A. to brew and sell San Miguel Beer in Spain. La Segarra S.A., renamed San Miguel, Fábricas de Cerveza y Malta (now Mahou-San Miguel Group) in 1957, was a separate, independent company that had exclusive rights to use the San Miguel brand in Europe.

===San Miguel Corporation (1963–present)===

====Andrés Soriano Jr.: 1963–1984====
In 1963, the company&#x27;s name was changed to San Miguel Corporation (SMC) and moved to a new head office along Ayala Avenue in Makati.

Andrés Soriano died on December 30, 1964. At the time of his death, Soriano had parlayed his family&#x27;s vast San Miguel fortune into mining, dairies, factories, a newspaper and a radio station. He had investments in Philippine Airlines, held the largest Coca-Cola franchise, and owned five insurance agency distributorships, a Kansas City brewery that made Lone Star and Colt 45, gold mines in British East Africa and a development company in Spain.

Following Soriano&#x27;s death, Antonio Róxas y Gargollo was elected chairman and Andrés Soriano Jr. became president. Soriano Jr. would become chairman in 1967 and was credited with instituting modern management, including decentralization along product lines.

The Mandaue, Cebu complex was inaugurated in 1967 – its brewery and glass plant commenced operations a year later. Soriano Jr. continued to diversify the food business, building an ice cream plant in 1970 and expanding into poultry production in 1973 (it later added shrimp processing and freezing in 1984). By 1973, SMC sales exceeded a billion pesos for the first time and profits topped the hundred-million-peso mark.

A new corporate logo was adopted in 1975. The San Miguel &quot;escudo&quot; (seal), symbol of the royal grant, was retained as the logo of San Miguel Beer, its original grantee.

SMC encountered its first major competitor in the Philippine beer market in 1982 with the entry of Asia Brewery, Inc. The rivalry between Asia Brewery and SMC came to a head in 1988, when Asia Brewery cannily introduced a bargain-priced brand called simply, &quot;Beer&quot; (also known as Beer Pale Pilsen and &quot;Beer na Beer&quot;). The product looked and tasted like San Miguel Beer, playing upon the fact that in the Philippines, the San Miguel brand was synonymous with beer. It was a creative counter to SMC&#x27;s notoriously aggressive and sometimes cutthroat competitive strategy, which had reportedly included &quot;attempts to sabotage Asia Brewery&#x27;s sales network and smash its empty bottles.&quot; Asia Brewery even hired away San Miguel&#x27;s brew master.

At that time, the original San Miguel Brewery buildings in San Miguel, Manila were demolished upon transfer of ownership to the Philippine Government, and became part of the Malacañang Palace grounds. The site became a park while some became part of the government complex (as the new executive building).

In 1983, SMC sold its remaining minority interest in the Spanish company (San Miguel, Fábricas de Cerveza y Malta, S.A.). The Philippine and Spanish companies have been operated independently of one another. The Spanish company enjoyed success with San Miguel in its home market and throughout Europe.

====Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.: 1983–1986====
Soriano&#x27;s administration also witnessed the battle for corporate control. A thorny issue of management transparency broke Soriano&#x27;s longstanding alliance with his Zóbel de Ayala relatives. This historical corporate battle resulted in the loss of effective control by the Sorianos, the Róxas de Ayalas and the Zóbel de Ayalas.

In 1983, Enrique J. Zóbel, president of Ayala Corporation and vice chairman of the SMC board, instigated a takeover of SMC. The seeds of the family feud lay in the refusal of the Soriano management to share corporate information with Zóbel, particularly regarding contracts that SMC management was entering into with ANSCOR, a Soriano company. Soriano viewed his third cousin Zóbel as a rival, while Zóbel (holding nearly 20% of SMC stake) viewed Soriano (with about 7%) as mismanaging the company and engaging in sweetheart deals. Unable to oust Soriano, Zóbel sold his group&#x27;s 19.5% stake to businessman Eduardo Cojuangco Jr., an associate of then President Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco&#x27;s Coconut Industry Investment Fund (a.k.a., United Coconut Planters Bank) accumulated an additional 31% of SMC, giving him effective control of SMC and leaving the Soriano family with a mere 3%. Funds used by Cojuangco to acquire Zóbel&#x27;s stake came from levies imposed by the Marcos dictatorship on coconut farmers. The Supreme Court has declared such levies to be public funds and therefore any assets bought using these funds are owned by coconut farmers. In the 1970s, then Philippine President, Ferdinand Marcos imposed a tax on the production of coconuts, a major Philippine cash crop, with the proceeds supposed to fund that industry&#x27;s development. It was alleged, however, that the money was funneled into United Coconut Planters Bank, controlled by Eduardo Cojuangco Jr., which Cojuangco then used much of the funds to help him purchase his controlling stake in San Miguel in 1983. The controlling interest carried nine of SMC&#x27;s 15 directors seats with it.

After Soriano&#x27;s death from cancer on March 19, 1984, Cojuangco became the chairman of SMC. That same year, SMC moved to its new head office in Mandaluyong. Cojuangco brought coconut oil milling and refining operations into SMC&#x27;s portfolio. His reign, however, was cut short when Marcos was toppled in 1986.

====Andrés Soriano III: 1986–1998====

After the People Power Revolution in 1986, Corazón Aquino, Cojuangco&#x27;s estranged cousin, became president of the Philippines. Aquino rode on the crest of widespread public outrage over the assassination of her husband, Benigno Aquino Jr., in 1983. One of the people blamed for her husband&#x27;s death was Cojuangco, who fled on the same aircraft as Marcos to Hawaii in 1986. The Aquino administration sequestered Cojuangco&#x27;s stake in SMC and agreed to let Andrés Soriano III, son of the late Soriano, run the company in spite of the Soriano family&#x27;s holdings in San Miguel being a mere 1%.

Soriano launched a campaign to reclaim the family legacy, but when he tried to buy back the abandoned shares, he was blocked by the Aquino administration&#x27;s Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG). The PCGG assumed control (but not legal ownership) of the 51.4-percent stake and refused to relinquish it. The government asserted that the stake had been illegally obtained. The PCGG continued to tend its SMC stake into the early 1990s, but it acceded &quot;de facto&quot; control of the conglomerate to Soriano via a management contract with ANSCOR. Soriano continued the company&#x27;s program of expansion, acquiring majority control of La Tondeña, Inc., the leading producer of hard liquor in the Philippines, in 1987 and adding beef and pork production (Monterey Meats) to the company&#x27;s food operations in 1988.

Soriano embarked on an internationalization program, hoping to expand into other countries and mitigate the effects of the Philippines&#x27; unstable economy. He also wanted to head off encroaching competition from the world&#x27;s biggest breweries, namely Anheuser-Busch and Miller of the United States, Kirin of Japan, and BSN of France.

Soriano allocated $1 billion to a five-year strategic internationalization program that focused on shaping up domestic operations, then progressing to licensing and exporting, overseas production, and finally to distribution of non-beer products.

A subsequent decentralization created a holding company structure, with 18 non-beer operations positioned as subsidiaries. This corporate reorganization freed the spun off businesses from the bureaucratic shackles of a large conglomerate. In the course of this multifaceted effort to attain optimum efficiency, SMC reduced its workforce by more than 16%, from a 1989 high of 39,138 to 32,832 by 1993.

SMC then turned to the next stage in its internationalization: a beer licensing and exporting initiative. Although the company had exported beer for most of its history, this effort was intensified dramatically in the late 1980s. SMC&#x27;s beer exports grew by 150% from 1985 to 1989 alone, and the brand was soon exported to 24 countries, including all of Asia&#x27;s key markets as well as the United States, Australia, and the Middle East. Once the core brand was established in a particular market, SMC would begin to create production facilities, sometimes on an independent basis and sometimes in concert with an indigenous joint-venture partner. By 1995, SMC had manufacturing plants in Hong Kong, China, Indonesia, Vietnam, and had licensing partners in Taiwan, Guam and Nepal.

Thus, in spite of the overarching legal dispute over SMC&#x27;s ownership (not to mention other problems endemic to operating in the Philippines), the company&#x27;s sales quintupled from P12.23 billion in 1986 to P68.43 billion by 1994. Net income increased twice as fast, from P1.11 billion to P 11.86 billion over the same period, although its overseas operations (as a whole) were not yet profitable.

In 1996, SMC purchased full control of its Hong Kong arm, San Miguel Brewery Hong Kong Ltd. In April of the following year, SMC&#x27;s domestic soft-drink bottling unit, Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc., was merged into the Australia-based Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. (CCA). In effect, SMC exchanged its 70-percent interest in a Philippine-only operation for a 25-percent stake in CCA, which had operations in 17 countries. CCA soon demerged the latter operations into a UK-based firm called Coca-Cola Beverages plc (resulting in a reduction of SMC&#x27;s stake in CCA to 22 percent).

From 1995 through 1997, SMC suffered a downturn in its main domestic businesses, while overseas operations were still in the red. Profits plummeted. In response, a major restructuring of the company&#x27;s loss-making food businesses was undertaken. SMC&#x27;s Magnolia ice cream and milk business was merged with the Nestlé Philippines group to form Magnolia-Nestlé Corporation. By late 1998, SMC&#x27;s stake in this business was acquired by Nestlé. SMC also exited from the ready-to-eat meal sector and curtailed the operations of its shrimp farming business. By late 1997, the company was also beginning to feel the effects of the Asian economic crisis.

====The Cojuangco-Ang era: 1998–2020====
Following the assumption of Joseph Estrada as President of the Philippines on June 30, 1998, Andrés Soriano III resigned in July 1998 and Eduardo M. Cojuangco Jr. was elected chairman of SMC. Francisco C. Eizmendi Jr. stayed as president and chief operating officer and Ramón S. Ang was elected vice-chairman in January 1999. Ang was appointed president and chief operating officer following the retirement of Eizmendi in 2002.

Confronted by greater competitive pressures as a result of the 1997 financial crisis, the pace of change quickened for San Miguel upon Cojuangco&#x27;s return. Amid an extremely difficult operating environment, working toward configuring the corporation to have better response to the highly competitive climate of the time. The immediate goals upon assuming leadership were to ease the burden of the spiralling interest expense, pursue new strategic alliances to strengthen the business - particularly in the international arena - and strengthen its profitability and financial standing to position the company for new opportunities. Progress was made on reducing costs, improving productivity and generating cash flow.

Having installed a critical mass of brewing capacity in China, Indonesia and Vietnam, the new management decided to continue the company&#x27;s investments in these areas, aggressively focusing on brand and volume building initiatives, most especially in China. SMC revamped the selling and distribution organization resulting in higher distribution efficiency, improved coverage of key accounts, greater pricing stability and reduced overall costs. In China, the company chose to focus on growth markets while still reaching close to 30 cities. Whereas in the past, it had primarily concentrated on the premium market it now pushed its medium and low-end brands.

By the end of 1998, Cojuangco sold SMC&#x27;s stake in Coca-Cola Beverages plc (Coca-Cola Amatil&#x27;s bottler in Europe), along with SMC&#x27;s 45% stake in Nestlé Philippines.

In May, the San Miguel Brewing International (SMBIL) regional headquarters was transferred from Hong Kong to Manila and to reduce overhead expenses, the employees of SMBIL were repatriated. The group-wide logistics and purchasing functions were realigned at the corporate level. The food, liquor and international operations were recapitalized. Metro Bottled Water Corporation, manufacturer of Wilkins Distilled Water, was acquired. In February 2001, SMC re-acquired control of Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. Shortly after, SMC acquired Pure Foods Corporation, becoming the undisputed market leader in the Philippines&#x27; food industry, owning two-thirds of the refrigerated and processed meat market, and over a third of the poultry and feeds industries.

For the next three years, SMC bought six companies in four neighbouring countries. Its first major acquisition was Australian boutique brewer J. Boag and Son for A$96 million in 2000. To further its aims as a business, SMC took in Japanese brewer Kirin Brewery Co. Ltd., which acquired a 15-percent stake in SMC, for $540 million in 2002. SMC continued its international acquisitions, paying $97 million for Thai Amarit Brewery Ltd. and $35.5 million for food processor TTC (Vietnam) Co. in 2003. In 2004, it bought 51 percent of Berri Ltd., Australia&#x27;s top juice maker, for $97.9 million. By 2004, international sales comprised 13 percent of total revenues from 10 percent the previous year. In 2005, the company made its biggest overseas acquisition with the takeover of National Foods Ltd., Australia&#x27;s largest publicly traded dairy, which it bought for P80.38 billion. That was followed later in the year with its $420-million purchase of Singapore-based Del Monte Pacific Ltd., the region&#x27;s largest pineapple canner. San Miguel merged National Foods&#x27; operation with Berri.

In 2006, SMC sold its 65% stake in Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. (including its subsidiaries Cosmos Bottling and Philippine Beverage Partners) to The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) for $590 million. In November 2007, SMC sold Boag&#x27;s to Lion Nathan for A$325 million. The same month, SMC also sold National Foods to Kirin for ¥294 billion.

In 2010, SMC acquired majority control of Petron Corporation.

In April 2012, SMC bought a 49% minority stake in Philippine Airlines (PAL) Holdings, worth US$500 million, to revitalize PAL and Air Philippines. On September 15, 2014, SMC sold its stake in PAL holdings for approximately $1.3 billion and relinquished management control back to the group of Lucio Tan.

SMC has also expanded its oil and energy business with the purchase of Esso Malaysia Berhad (65%), ExxonMobil Borneo Sdn Bhd (100%) and ExxonMobil Malaysia Sdn Bhd (100%) for US$577.3 million.

In October 2012, SMC bought back the 24% of SMC shares held by the government through Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF) companies by paying CIIF P57.6 billion.

By 2017, Iñigo Zóbel, son of Enrique J. Zóbel, became the largest common stock shareholder of SMC owning 66.1% through his holding company, Top Frontier Investment Holdings, Inc.

On November 6, 2017, SMC announced the consolidation of its beverage businesses into San Miguel Pure Foods Company, Inc. through a $6.6-billion share swap deal. San Miguel Pure Foods Company will acquire 7.86 billion shares in San Miguel Brewery Inc. and 216.97 million shares in Ginebra San Miguel Inc. from SMC. After the consolidation, San Miguel Pure Foods Company will be renamed San Miguel Food and Beverage, Inc.

====Ramon S. Ang: 2020–present====
On June 16, 2020, Cojuangco passed away at the age of 85 due to heart failure and pneumonia.

On April 15, 2021, ten months following the death of Cojuangco, SMC amended its by-laws to unify the role, functions and duties of chief executive officer (CEO) to that of the president. Based on the PSE disclosure following the 2021 annual stockholders&#x27; meeting of SMC, Ang remains as vice-chairman, president (CEO) and COO of the company. As of the June 8, 2021, organizational meeting, the position of chairman of the board of directors remains vacant.

From August to September 2022, Iñigo U. Zobel sold a total of 86.432 million shares, this reduced his ownership to 1.487 billion shares or 62.36 percent.

On June 10, 2024, Ang became the chairman and CEO, and his eldest son, John Paul L. Ang, assumed the positions of vice-chairman, president and COO. SMC shall amend its by-laws to redefine the roles, functions and duties of the chairman and chief executive officer, and the president and chief operating officer, subject to stockholders and SEC approvals.

==Legal issues==
SMC shares are also involved in the controversial Coco Levy Case (Sandiganbayan Civil Case No. 33), which is actually subdivided into a total of eight cases involving different parties and properties. Arguably the most important case is Case No. 33-F, which involves 51% of the shares of SMC. This majority stake at SMC has been further subdivided into three separate litigations, each of which reaching the Supreme Court in highly contentious proceedings.
The first case involved 4% of SMC shares, which, in the case of &quot;San Miguel Corporation vs. Sandiganbayan&quot;, was awarded by the Supreme Court to the government. The second case, &quot;Republic of the Philippines vs. Sandiganbayan and Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.&quot;, involved a 20% block that the Supreme Court, voting 7–4, awarded to Cojuangco. The most recent High Court pronouncement came early this year, &quot;Philippine Coconut Producers Federation, Inc. (COCOFED) vs. Republic of the Philippines&quot;, where the Court, voting 11–0, declared that the remaining 27% of SMC is owned by the government. (Note: The 27% had been diluted to 24% due to the government&#x27;s failure to subscribe to the increased authorized capital stock of SMC)

==Sports teams==

===Basketball===
SMC has long been involved in commercial basketball in the Philippines beginning with the Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association (MICAA) founded in 1938, where SMC organized its first basketball team, playing under the name San Miguel Brewery. After the company changed its name to San Miguel Corporation, the team&#x27;s name was changed to San Miguel Corporation Braves (or the San Miguel Braves). SMC remained with the MICAA until the league&#x27;s dissolution in 1982.

In 1975, SMC organized its second basketball team, when the company became a founding member of the Philippine Basketball Association, the first professional basketball league in Asia. The team is currently playing as the San Miguel Beermen and is currently the PBA franchise with the most championships (29).

SMC also owns two more PBA teams, Barangay Ginebra San Miguel and the Magnolia Hotshots, as a result of corporate acquisitions.

After the dissolution of the MICAA in 1983, the Philippine Amateur Basketball League, later renamed Philippine Basketball League, was formed in 1983 to take its place as the major amateur basketball league in the Philippines. SMC was one of the league&#x27;s founding members and remained until the league became dormant in 2010. Its franchise, the Magnolia Purewater Wizards won a total of nine championships.

SMC also participated in the ASEAN Basketball League, playing as the San Miguel Beermen (ABL) from 2011 to 2013, winning one ABL championship.

On February 1, 2018, SMC became the name sponsor of Alab Pilipinas.

On February 1, 2018, moments after its partnership with ABL team Alab Pilipinas was formally announced, SMC forged another tie up but this time with Colegio de San Juan de Letran and vowed to support its sports program. In the summer of 2019 the Knights joined the PBA D-League as Petron-Letran to prepare for the upcoming NCAA Season 95 tournament and on November 19, 2019, they took home the school&#x27;s 18th Men&#x27;s Basketball championship by beating the defending champions San Beda Red Lions.

<text>Piggy is the name of two animated cartoon characters in the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of films distributed by Warner Bros. The first character was a fat, black pig wearing a pair of shorts with two large buttons in the front, and his first film was &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know What You&#x27;re Doin&#x27;!&quot;

Piggy&#x27;s name came from one of two brothers who were childhood classmates of Freleng&#x27;s, nicknamed &quot;Porky&quot; and &quot;Piggy&quot;.

==Merrie Melodies==
Animator Rudolf Ising introduced Piggy to replace his previous character, Foxy, as the star of the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series Ising was directing for producer Leon Schlesinger. Nonetheless, Ising had only made two Piggy shorts in 1931 before he left Warner Bros. with partner Hugh Harman. The animators who took over the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons dropped the Piggy character (as well as his girlfriend Fluffy) and turned the series into a string of one-shots.

Piggy&#x27;s coloration and dress were identical to those of the Walt Disney character Mickey Mouse before the advent of color film. John Kenworthy argues that, considering the fact that some sketches of mice that Hugh Harman had drawn in 1925 were the inspiration for the creation of Mickey Mouse, Harman and Ising never intended to copy Disney.

Despite their clichéd lead character, Ising&#x27;s two Piggy shorts are well received by some critics. In the first, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know What You&#x27;re Doin&#x27;!&quot;, Piggy visits a surreal nightclub where he heckles and plays with the club&#x27;s jazz band. Cartoon historians Jerry Beck and Will Friedwald call this &quot;the definitive Harman-Ising Warner film: the characters are cute, the humor is gross, the visuals are uninhibited, and the music is red hot.&quot;

This was followed by &quot;Hittin&#x27; the Trail for Hallelujah Land&quot;, also in 1931. Here, Piggy plays a steamboat captain who must rescue a drowning Uncle Tom. Due to its stereotypical portrayal of the Uncle Tom character, the cartoon is included among the so-called &quot;Censored 11&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; shorts that are withheld from circulation due to their heavy use of ethnic stereotypes. Piggy never starred in another cartoon, although he continued to appear at the end of every short up to 1932&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re Too Careless with Your Kisses!&quot;

In 1936, Animator Friz Freleng created another character named Piggy. This character was given lighter, more white color with distinguishing birthmarks. The redesigned character appeared as a gluttonous child in a large family of pigs in &quot;At Your Service Madame&quot; (which gives his full name as &quot;Piggy Hamhock&quot;), where he leads his fellow siblings in foiling a bum&#x27;s attempt to rob their mother.

A year later, the new Piggy starred in &quot;Pigs Is Pigs&quot; in which his gluttony takes center stage. This is his final appearance. After this, he is discarded, with his character traits transferred for a time to Porky Pig.

<text>A surface marker buoy, SMB, dive float or simply a blob is a buoy used by scuba divers, at the end of a line from the diver, intended to indicate the diver&#x27;s position to people at the surface while the diver is underwater. Two kinds are used; one (SMB) is towed for the whole dive, and indicates the position of the dive group throughout the dive, and the other, a delayed surface marker buoy, DSMB or decompression buoy, is deployed towards the end of the dive as a signal to the surface that the divers have started to ascend, and where they are going to surface. Both types can also function as a depth reference for controlling speed of ascent and accurately maintaining depth at decompression stops. Surface marker buoys are also used by freedivers in open water, to indicate the approximate position of the diver when submerged. They may also be used to support a catch bag or fish stringer by underwater hunters and collectors. A DSMB is considered by recreational scuba divers and service providers to be a highly important item of safety equipment, yet its use is not part of the entry level recreational diver training for all training agencies, and there are significant hazards associated with incompetent use.

A &quot;safety sausage&quot; or &quot;signal tube&quot; is a low volume tubular buoy inflated at or near the surface to increase visibility of the diver in the water. A DSMB can be put to this service when necessary. When used by a diver to indicate their position, any of these may be described as a personal marker buoy.

Another function for a buoy deployed by a diver is to mark the position of an underwater point of interest. In this use the buoy is attached to the target until the position has been recorded, or until the marking function is no longer required. A wider range of equipment is used for this function, including the same equipment that would normally be used for marking the position of the diver. A problem associated with this use is how to hold the buoy in position at the point of interest but still be able to retrieve it from the surface.

== Standard buoy ==
=== Primary function ===

Surface marker buoys are floated on the surface during a dive to mark the diver&#x27;s position during drift dives, night dives, mist or disturbed sea conditions such as Beaufort force 2 or greater. The buoy lets the dive boat follow the divers and highlights their position to other boat traffic which makes it easier to stay clear. In some waters divers may be required to use a float to mark their presence. The US Coast Guard has conducted a public education campaign to get divers to add identification information to their dive-floats, to help them identify and find lost divers, and so divers who lost their floats can advise the Coast Guard that, if found, their float should be regarded as a false alarm.

===Other uses===

Occasionally an SMB is used in conditions of poor visibility where there is a risk of inadvertently penetrating an overhead environment, to ensure that there is a guideline leading out of the overhead to the surface.

In an emergency where buoyancy control is lost due to a BCD leak, the SMB can be used to compensate for buoyancy loss to the extent of the buoyancy of the surfaced buoy. This may require considerably more effort to wind in the line, but finning upwards will help. The buoyancy of any SMB can be used to help maintain a constant depth at decompression stops, and the process of winding in the line can help maintain a steady ascent rate.

Competitors in the underwater sport underwater orienteering are required to tow a SMB with a buoyancy of at least during competition swims. This is both for safety, and to allow the judges to monitor the route taken by the diver and to score the points for time and accuracy. Such SMBs are designed for low drag, which is a useful feature in any SMB that will be towed by the diver.

A GPS tracker can be mounted on the SMB to record a dive track. This can be downloaded and used to establish positions of underwater landmarks with reasonable accuracy depending on surface conditions and current. Position of a point of interest can be established by the timestamp on a photograph taken of the feature if the camera clock is synchronised with the GPS unit. The position will be most accurate when the buoy line is tensioned to float as close as possible to directly above the diver.

Spearfishers also use surface marker buoys to mark the position of the speargun in case it is necessary to let go after spearing a fish or for any other reason. These are towed on a line attached to the speargun handle. Similar buoys with catch bags are used by freedivers for other underwater hunting and gathering activities. They serve as a place to gather and transport the catch, and may be equipped with a means of hooking to the bottom to stop them drifting away while the diver is busy.

A surface marker buoy is considered an essential tool in the initial project phases for establishing a coral nursery, when exploratory dives are being conducted to find suitable sites for nurseries, donor sites and transplantation sites. The SMB is used to mark these areas until a GPS position can be recorded.

=== Construction ===
Buoys for this use are usually either inflated and sealed by a valve or cap, or made from buoyant material, so they cannot deflate or flood during the dive, rendering them ineffective. High-visibility colours such as red, orange and yellow are popular. Sometimes the float includes a small diving flag. If the buoy is to be towed by the diver at any speed, a low drag float and small diameter line can reduce the drag significantly. The torpedo buoys used by lifesavers are sometimes used as surface marker buoys as they are visible, tough, available, and reasonably low drag.

To avoid losing the reel, a lanyard may be used to attach the diving reel to the diver. This lanyard can clip to the buoyancy compensator or go around the wrist. If the lanyard clips to the buoyancy compensator, the user should take care to release it if there is surface boating activity, as boats may drag divers up by their SMB reels. The DIR diving philosophy considers unsafe any attachment of the diver to equipment or objects which end above the water surface in waters where boats may operate, due to high risk associated with snagging the object on a boat and dragging the diver upwards in spite of their decompression obligation or maximum ascent speed limit.

=== Hazards ===
* Although a primary function of a SMB is to notify boat users of the presence and location of divers in the water, it can happen that the buoy or line becomes snagged on a moving vessel. This will pull the line upwards, and if it is fastened to the diver, will pull the diver upwards, probably at an unsafe speed, putting the diver at moderate to severe risk of decompression illness.
* In areas where the variation of current with depth is strong, a diver being towed by an SMB may not be able to control their speed and direction of drift sufficiently to avoid being dragged against obstacles on the bottom, or to stay with other members of the group.
* In areas of high relief, the line may snag far above the diver. If the current is strong the diver may have to abandon the buoy to avoid being swept upwards in an arc.
* Loose line in the water is an entanglement hazard. A diver&#x27;s equipment can snag on even a taut SMB line. In most cases this does not prevent the diver from surfacing, but it is possible to snag on both the diver and part of the fixed environment. Usually this can be cut loose if the diver has an appropriate cutting tool.

== Decompression buoy ==

A delayed surface marker buoy (DSMB), decompression buoy, or deco buoy is an inflatable buoy which can be deployed while the diver is submerged and generally only towards the end of the dive. The buoy marks the diver&#x27;s position underwater so the dive boat crew can locate the diver even though the diver may have drifted some distance from the dive site while doing decompression stops. A reel and line connect the buoy on the surface to the diver beneath the surface. A DSMB can help the diver maintain accurate depth during a decompression stop. Alternative means of marking one&#x27;s position while doing decompression stops are shot-lines, uplines and decompression trapezes.

A closed DSMB, inflated through a valve, is likely to be more reliable, by remaining inflated, than an open ended buoy which seals by holding the opening under water. A decompression buoy is not intended to be used to lift heavy weights: for this purpose divers use a lifting bag.

=== Design ===
There are at least four methods of keeping the air in the inflated decompression buoy. The buoy can be:
* open ended (preferably with a small weight built into the bottom end to keep the opening submerged to prevent the air escaping when the float is lying horizontal at the surface, which will happen whenever there is no tension on the line);
* open ended self-sealing buoys (the air in the buoy expands as the buoy ascends and is kept in by a flap valve neck at the bottom of the buoy);
* sealed, with an inflation valve and a pressure relief valve;
* sealed, with a small integral air supply cylinder and a pressure relief valve.
Divers following the recommendations of some training organisations carry two differently coloured deco buoys underwater so that they can signal to their surface support for help and still remain underwater decompressing. For example, in some circles in Europe, a red buoy indicates normal decompression and a yellow buoy indicates a problem, such as shortage of gas, that the surface support should investigate and resolve. Although in other circles, two buoys (any colour) up one line means the same, currently the protocol is not universally accepted even within Europe. While the usual colours are red, yellow and orange, bright pink, lime green, bicoloured red and yellow, and black buoys are also available and may show up well in particular circumstances. It is quite common to have one or more stripes of reflective tape, which reflect light back towards the source. This works well if searchers have a good light source.

Some types of buoy provide an attachment for a strobe light, cyalume stick or writing slate, which can convey signals to the surface support. Reflective tape may be used to make the buoy more visible at night.
Length is usually from . Visibility at a distance in waves is largely determined by height.

The size of a decompression buoy is to some extent at the diver&#x27;s discretion. A tall buoy is more visible in rough water, and a larger diameter is visible at a greater distance. A large volume holds more gas and is more buoyant, which is helpful for some purposes, but is a greater hazard during deployment in the event of a reel jam.

=== Deployment practice ===
Reliably safe deployment in difficult conditions depends on sufficient practice and familiarity with the equipment and the specific technique to be used for inflation.
*Deployment may be from the bottom, as an aid to ascent and as a signal indicating position, from midwater, to indicate position, maintain decompression depth, and warn boat traffic, or at the surface as a means of attracting attention.
*The DSMB bag is unrolled. It may be necessary to connect it to the line on the reef or spool, but in many cases it is stored already connected. A quick but secure method of connection such as a bolt snap avoids delays and task loading distraction.
*The reel or spool is unclipped from the diver&#x27;s harness if this has not already been done. The risk of uncontrolled ascent if the reel jams during deployment and is connected to the diver is generally considered unacceptable.
*A small amount of gas is introduced into the bag to vertically align the buoy, and allow the diver to check that the assembly is ready to deploy the line freely. Any clip or locking device restricting line deployment is released. A friction brake should allow easy but slightly restrained rotation to prevent inertia overwind. The diver adjusts buoyancy to ensure that they do not float upwards excessively during the deployment. The amount of buoyancy adjustment will vary with depth and the method of filling the buoy, but ascending a few metres during deployment is generally considered to just be the start of ascent.
*Sufficient gas to adequately inflate the buoy when at the surface is introduced, taking into account the expansion due to reduced ambient pressure during ascent, by one of the following methods, and the bag released to ascend. A ratchet reel should be held with the pawl disengaged, a spool allowed to spin on a finger or in a cupped hand:
** The valve of the integral inflation cylinder is cracked open.
** The bottom opening of the buoy is held open above the exhaust opening of the demand valve in use for breathing, and a few breaths exhaled.
** A demand valve mouthpiece is held under the bottom opening and the DV purged.
** A low pressure inflation hose end is pushed onto the inflation tube of the buoy, which automatically releases gas into the buoy. When released it will automatically disconnect.
** The mouthpiece of the buoyancy compensator control valve is held under the bottom opening and the contents of the BC discharged into the buoy. If more gas is needed, the inflate and dump valves are opened together and gas flows into the buoy bypassing the BCD. This procedure requires the valve to be higher than the BC bladder to induce air flow by hydrostatic pressure difference.
** A dedicated valve on an extra low pressure hose can be used at the bottom opening of the buoy.
** The diver can orally inflate the buoy through an oral inflation valve, if fitted.
*In all cases, the amount of slack line should be kept to a minimum to reduce the risk of fouling on the diver or equipment, and the reel or spool held away from the diver while unrolling. The diver should ensure slightly negative buoyancy to allow sufficient filling without being dragged up by the partly filled buoy to a depth where expanding gas makes buoyancy control difficult. This is easier at depth, but the risk of injury if dragged up is also greater.
*The diver checks that there are no line snags on any equipment, and takes up any slack by winding the line onto the reel or spool, before starting the ascent.
*Tension should be maintained on the line during ascent to avoid entanglement, by reeling it in as fast as the diver ascends. This is easily controlled by maintaining slight negative buoyancy at all times.

=== Deployment problems and hazards ===
Several problems may be encountered when deploying decompression buoys.
* The reel jams after the buoy is inflated, dragging the diver up. This can be compounded by expansion of the gas in a dry suit, and gas in the buoyancy compensator, all of which must be dealt with at the same time, and fast enough to prevent an uncontrolled ascent. To avoid this, a diver can:
** before the dive, ensure that the line is rolled up on the reel under appropriate tension without overwinds;
** ensure that the line on the reel is free from knots, loops or tangles;
** use a simpler system or a reel which cannot jam (e.g. a weighted spool of line);
** detach the lanyard connecting the diver to the reel before inflating the buoy and ensure no equipment is snagged on the buoy or reel. If the reel jams it is simply abandoned;
** attach two reels to each other in series. If one fails the other is unlocked to reel out its line.
* The diver or part of the diver&#x27;s equipment gets snagged or entangled on the buoy or line, dragging the diver up, with possibly fatal consequences. To avoid this, a diver may:
** tie the lanyard of the reel to something solid on the sea bed before inflating the buoy, giving time to sort the problem out. This is not always practicable - the buoy may be deployed in midwater:
** avoid bights of slack line which could loop around anything while filling the buoy;
** keep the buoy and line away from the diver&#x27;s other equipment during deployment, particularly away from equipment that the diver cannot easily see or reach. In effect this means keeping the line and buoy in front of, and above the diver as much as possible.
* The diver removes the primary demand valve from his or her mouth to inflate the buoy, and is therefore at a disadvantage in dealing with any other problems that might arise as the deco buoy goes up. The ways to avoid this include:
** using a deco buoy with its own air supply;
** using a secondary demand valve, such as an octopus, to inflate the buoy;
** using a sealed buoy with an inflation valve, which is filled by blowing directly into the valve inlet or by attaching a medium-pressure inflation hose from the buoyancy compensator (BCD) or dry suit (the valve does not retain the hose connector, like the BCD or suit inflator valve, and the hose can be easily pulled off the valve when the buoy is sufficiently filled);
** holding an open ended buoy above the primary demand valve exhaust port and direct several exhalations up into the open end of the buoy. This technique is also useful in cold conditions to prevent a freeflow caused by high flow rate due to pressing the purge button.
**Filling an open-ended DSMB from the buoyancy compensator power inflator head. This also allows the diver to dump gas from the BCD into the DSMB, keeping a constant buoyancy for part of the filling procedure. If there is not enough gas in the BCD, the power inflator can be used to supply more gas to the DSMB by pressing the inflate and deflate buttons simultaneously, diverting the inflation gas through the exhaust valve to the DSMB. Once the DSMB reaches the surface, it will support the diver and buoyancy can be readjusted under controlled conditions.
*The demand valve develops a free-flow while filling the DSMB. This can deplete the contents of the scuba cylinder rapidly, and since the DSMB is commonly deployed at the end of the dive, when the breathing gas has reached a critically low level, this can put the diver in a situation of inadequate gas supply for a safe ascent. This risk is greater in very cold conditions when regulator freezing is possible. This can be avoided by:
**not using a demand valve to fill the DSMB;
**using a desensitised demand valve which is less likely to free-flow;
**Using exhaled gas from the DV exhaust port.
* The reel over-rotates, causing a loose bight, which can snag or jam the reel. This can be avoided by having sufficient friction in the reel spindle that the drag slows rotation rapidly when there is not enough tension in the line to maintain unrolling, or by holding a hand against the reel to slow it down.

== Safety sausage ==

A safety sausage or signal tube is an inflatable buoy used when the diver is at the surface to indicate the diver&#x27;s position to the dive boat, reducing the risk of losing contact when air, light or sea conditions decrease the visibility of the divers from the boat. The sausage is a plastic tube that is normally inflated by putting one end under water and purging the second stage underneath to inflate it. Inflated tubes are normally about tall. Uninflated tubes roll up and fit in a buoyancy compensator pocket. Commercial boat dive operations, especially at offshore reefs or areas known for strong currents or rapid weather changes, may require divers to carry safety sausages or an equivalent. A safety sausage is not a substitute for a surface marker buoy or diver down flag, though some divers use the term safety sausage to refer to a DSMB as well as a signal tube.

The safety sausage is claimed to have been invented by New Zealand diver Bob Begg in 1984 after a search and rescue exercise organized by the Dunedin Marine Search and Rescue Advisory Committee failed to find the two divers equipped with yellow scuba cylinders, yellow BCDs, and a yellow catch bag, in an unsuccessful air search of about 3 hours, during which the aircraft with experienced spotters flew directly over the divers at least once without seeing them. The divers were eventually spotted by a fishing boat.

==Point of interest markers==

Small deployable marker buoys are available that are provided with a length of line wrapped around the hard foam buoy, and with a small weight which almost balances the buoyancy. These can be deployed by a diver to mark a point of interest and can be recovered from the surface after the dive. They are deployed by releasing the weight from the buoy and allowing the line to unroll as the buoy floats to the surface. If the line is long enough the buoy will float at the surface with slack in the line and the weight will anchor it in place. If the line is too short the buoy will support the weight above the bottom and drift away.

<doc id="465871" wikidata="Q5477312" url="?curid=465871" title="Foxy (Merrie Melodies)">
<text>Foxy is an animated cartoon character featured in the first three animated shorts in the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series, all distributed by Warner Bros. in 1931. He was the creation of animator Rudolf Ising, who had worked for Walt Disney in the 1920s. The character is notable for his resemblance to Mickey Mouse, a similar character created by Disney in 1928.

==Concept and creation==
In 1925, Hugh Harman drew images of mice on a portrait of Walt Disney, a reminder of Disney&#x27;s fondness for the rodents living at the Laugh-O-Gram Studio in Kansas City, Missouri. Disney and Ub Iwerks would then use it as inspiration for their creating Mickey Mouse, the character who eventually established Disney as a major figure in Hollywood, also sparking a wave of &quot;clones&quot; at competing studios. Comics historian Don Markstein, calling Warner Bros. animator Rudolf Ising&#x27;s subsequent Foxy &quot;perhaps the leading Mickey Mouse imitator&quot;, observed that:
==Screen history==
===Merrie Melodies===

Foxy was the star of the first &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons Ising directed for producer Leon Schlesinger (Ising had already helped his partner Hugh Harman create another series, titled &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, with the character Bosko). Foxy&#x27;s first appearance on screen was in August 1931 in &quot;Lady, Play Your Mandolin!&quot; This short set in the Old West features Foxy developing affection for the tavern singer who would become his girlfriend.

Foxy and his then-nameless girlfriend would appear in another cartoon that same year: &quot;Smile, Darn Ya, Smile!&quot; (September 5, 1931), a musical set on a trolley. The plot bears some similarities to &quot;Trolley Troubles&quot;, a 1927 Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoon to which Harman and Ising contributed. This also marks the first time Foxy&#x27;s name was mentioned.

On October 3, 1931, a third short, &quot;One More Time&quot;, was released. This musical cops-&#x27;n&#x27;-robbers cartoon would become Foxy&#x27;s final appearance in the Merrie Melodies series and the character was believed by many to be killed off in the final scene, as a crow shoots Foxy in the back after he successfully captures a street gang.

Foxy&#x27;s film career ended abruptly with a phone call by Walt Disney, who asked Ising not to use a character so visually similar to Mickey Mouse. He was then replaced by Piggy, who appeared in the following two &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons.

At the end of each short, Foxy peeks out from behind a bass drum that reads &quot;A MERRIE MELODY&quot;, walks and says to the viewer, &quot;So long, folks!&quot;, while raising his arm, which would become the sign-off for &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons until the end of 1934.

Upon leaving Warner Bros. two years later, Ising took the rights to Foxy and other characters he and/or Harman conceived (including Piggy and Goopy Geer). Though Harman-Ising eventually found another distributor in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, none of their WB-era characters besides Bosko appeared in any more theatrical cartoons. All three Foxy shorts eventually went into the public domain.

===Later appearances===
Foxy appeared along with his girlfriend (here christened &quot;Roxy&quot;) and fellow forgotten Warner Bros. progenitor Goopy Geer in &quot;Two-Tone Town&quot;, an episode of the animated series &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; aired on September 28, 1992. The foxes were voiced by Rob Paulsen and Desirée Goyette respectively and were redesigned for the episode. Foxy&#x27;s appearance in this episode is similar to his theatrical version, except that the tear-drop ears are replaced by pointy ones to make him appear more fox-like and less Mickey-like. Also, his shoes lack spats. The three live in a world of black-and-white which is visited by the series&#x27; stars, Babs Bunny and Buster Bunny. Buster and Babs, feeling sorry for the old timers left in oblivion, decided to help bring Foxy, Roxy and Goopy alongside Big Bee (based on the bee from &quot;You&#x27;re Too Careless With Your Kisses!&quot;) back to the limelight. The efforts of the two rabbits work out but results in Buster and Babs being featured in guest appearances while the characters they helped become the new TV sensations.

<text>Neo-Hasidism, Neochassidut, or Neo-Chassidus, is an approach to Judaism in which people learn beliefs and practices of Hasidic Judaism, and incorporate it into their own lives or prayer communities, yet without formally joining a Hasidic group. Over the 20th century neo-Hasidism was popularized by the works of writers such as Hillel Zeitlin, Martin Buber, Abraham Joshua Heschel, Lawrence Kushner, Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, and Arthur Green.

Neo-Hasidism is not a denomination of Judaism, but rather an approach to Judaism which can be found in all movements of Judaism, both Orthodox and non-Orthodox. Among non-Orthodox Jews one can find adherents of neo-Hasidism in Conservative, Reform, Reconstructionism, and Aleph: The Alliance for Jewish Renewal.

In the 1970s and 1980s a similar movement amongst &quot;baalei teshuva&quot;— within more &quot;traditional&quot; Orthodoxy—was observed in the US,
influenced by Shlomo Carlebach, Aryeh Kaplan, Zvi Aryeh Rosenfeld and others, and reflecting the prevailing counterculture movement. To some extent, it has persisted to this day in such phenomena as the &quot;Carlebach minyan&quot; and the growth in the Breslov movement.

==Early 20th century==
Martin Buber helped initiate interest in Hasidism among modernized Jews through a series of books he wrote in the first decades of the 20th century, such as &quot;Tales of the Hasidim&quot; and the &quot;Legend of the Baal Shem Tov&quot;. In these books, Buber focused on the role of story telling and the charisma of early Hasidic masters as a vehicle for personal spirituality. As such, these books represent one aspect of Buber&#x27;s larger project of creating a new form of personalistic, existential religiosity. Buber came under considerable criticism, especially from younger contemporary Gershom Scholem, for having interpreted Hasidism in an eccentric way that misrepresented Hasidic belief and literature. Nevertheless, Buber&#x27;s sympathetic treatment of Hasidism proved attractive to many and started the 20th century romance between (idealized) Hasidism and non-Orthodox Jews.

==Post-World War II==

Following World War II, when the Hasidic centers of Central and Eastern Europe were decimated, some of the surviving communities relocated to America, creating new opportunities for American Jews to have direct experience with them, their practices and their beliefs. Most of these communities remained determinedly insular, but a few, primarily the Chabad and Bratslav (or Breslov) Hasidim, adopted an attitude of outreach to the larger Jewish community, seeking to win more Jews to the Hasidic way of life. 

Equally important was Abraham Joshua Heschel, a Holocaust refugee and scion of Hasidic royalty, who began his academic career in America with a life-saving but difficult wartime stint at HUC. In 1946, he moved to the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, the intellectual center for Conservative Judaism. There he still found himself marginalized for his Hasidic interests and customs, yet he surrounded himself with a small circle of devoted students (and eventual congregational rabbis) drawn to his mystically flavored phenomenology. As the 1960s began, Heschel was achieving increasing recognition as a theologian of stature with the publication of his books &quot;God in Search of Man&quot; and &quot;The Prophets.&quot; With that fame came an interest in his Hasidic roots and their role in his teachings. His social activism in the 1960s and 1970s further endeared him to many young Jews.

==1960s onward==
Several of Heschel&#x27;s students at JTS during the turbulent 1960s and early 1970s eventually became involved in the embryonic Havurah movement, a loosely defined project of creating an alternative, informal type of Jewish community first proposed by Reform theologian Jakob Petuchowski in the 1960s. While the movement spanned a broad spectrum of spiritual proclivities, some Jews in the founding circles, like Arthur Waskow, Arthur Green, and Michael Lerner, under the combined influence of Heschel and Schachter-Shalomi, took up the project of further exploring Hasidism and recasting it in an American idiom. Havurat Shalom, the flagship of this experimental quasi-communal movement which was started jointly by Green and Schachter-Shalomi in Boston, produced the greatest artifact of Havurah Judaism, the &quot;Jewish Catalog&quot; series, a set of three books devoted to &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; Judaism, written with a healthy dose of information and enthusiasm for things Hasidic.Havurah communities influenced by Hasidism were also influenced by Kabbalah.

These future neo-Hasids focused on selected attractive aspects of traditional Hasidism while rejecting teachings they found incompatible with modern egalitarian commitments, such as Hasidism&#x27;s attitudes toward women, sexuality, and non-Jews. A few of these devotees, like Waskow and Lerner, became writers of note and public square intellectuals in the Jewish community and in the Jewish Renewal movement. Others, such as Green and Lawrence Fine, became leading scholars in the Jewish academic world, bringing an appreciation of Hasidism and an interest in adapting its ideas and customs to contemporary mores and life. 

Through books like &quot;Tormented Master,&quot; &quot;The Language of Truth&quot; and &quot;Your Word Is Fire,&quot; Arthur Green (and others) made Hasidism both more accessible and compelling for Jews seeking personal spirituality amidst the outwardly focused and sometimes spiritually dry world of the formal American Jewish community. Among the liberal movements, the Reform community remained resistant to this trend for a longer period, but a few rabbis, such as Herbert Weiner and Lawrence Kushner, also started translating Hasidism into a Reform idiom, expanding its influence.

This overlapping of amorphous interest in Hasidism among academics, seekers, religious functionaries, intellectuals, &quot;alternative&quot; rabbis and teachers, has led to the coining of the term &quot;Neo-Hasidism (NH).&quot;

A few formalized groups and institutions, such as P&#x27;nai Or congregation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Elat Chayyim Retreat Center in Falls Village, Connecticut, and Central Reform Congregation in Saint Louis, Missouri, are substantially influenced by NH. NH also enjoyed a period of pre-eminence at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Seminary (RRC) during Arthur Green&#x27;s tenure there as dean.

==In Modern Orthodoxy==
In the past several years, many in modern-Orthodoxy began exploring the texts and way of life of Chasidic masters. Most notable are Chabad works (such as the Tanya) and the writings of Rabbi Nachman of Breslov. Rabbi Moshe Weinberger, founding rabbi of Congregation Aish Kodesh in Woodmere, New York, is widely considered the &quot;senior spokesman&quot; of the Neo-Hasidic movement in Modern Orthodoxy.

== Similarities and differences with Hasidism ==

By definition, neo-Hasidic Judaism has significant differences from Hasidic Judaism. 

Hasidic Jews view their rebbe as a person who is literally in a state of devekut (communion) with God in a way that most people are not; that a rebbe (or tzaddik) has purged his heart of the Evil Inclination. Further, Hasidim compare their Rebbe with God, in that the tzaddik becomes a channel for the divine will. 

:“A tzadik is like the creator, he is unified in the lower and higher worlds.” Hillel Halevi of Paritch

:“The will of God and the will of the tzadik are one“. Dov Ber of Mezeritch

In contrast, these beliefs are completely rejected by neo-Hasidism. Adherents of neo-Hasidic Judaism view their rabbis and prayer group leaders as people who are superior only in academic credentials - for instance, someone with rabbinic ordination and an academic record of studies in some topic (liturgy, rabbinic literature etc.) is respected as an academic. No human is considered to be more holy than any other. Neo-Hasidism aims to be more egalitarian.

Neo-Hasidim reject the Hasidic doctrine of bonding with the Tzadik (התקשרות לצדיקים); Hasidic Jews view their Rebbe as an intermediary between God and man (albeit in a functional and not an essential sense). Hasidic Jews are seek to bind themselves to God by virtue of being bound to their rebbe. Such ideas are largely rejected by Jews outside of Hasidic Judaism, including by neo-Hasidism.

Neo-Hasidim reject the Hasidic doctrine of dynastic succession. In Hasidic communities, the son (or son-in-law) of a Rebbe usually becomes the next rebbe. In contrast, this dynastic succession is rejected by neo-Hasidim.

Neo-Hasidim reject the Orthodox doctrine of strict gender differentiation in observance. In Hasidic Judaism, most mitzvot, including wearing tallitot, tefillin, writing a mezuzah scroll, and teaching Torah to groups including men are done by only men. Neo-Hasidism allows women to do some or all of these. In non-Orthodox neo-Hasidism, women are equal to men in every way: they can count in a minyan and be a shaliach tzibbur. In Modern Orthodox neo-Hasidic groups, women may not count in a minyan or be a shaliach tzibbur, in
alignment with Orthodox Jewish law.

<doc id="465875" wikidata="Q6554944" url="?curid=465875" title="Linucon">
<text>Linucon was a combination Linux expo/science fiction convention in Austin, Texas. Conceived as a &quot;sister convention&quot; to Penguicon, Linucon was co-founded by Rob Landley and Stu Green.

Two Linucons were held. The first Linucon was held October 8–10, 2004, at the Red Lion Inn located at 6121 North I-35 in Austin. Linucon 2.0 was held September 30 – October 2, 2005, at the Ambassador Hotel located at the intersection of I-35 and Highway 183.

The science fiction side had three main tracks: an anime track, a literary track, and a gaming track. These tracks included cosplay (and a Masquerade), filk, a dealer&#x27;s room, panels, author readings and signings, Birds of a Feather sessions, and an art show. The convention suite featured caffeinated Jell-O and ice cream made with liquid nitrogen. There was also a live action role-playing game. The video room played around the clock and both gaming rooms (computer and paper) were open 24 hours.

The technical side ranged over such subjects as Linux kernel architecture, security and network administration, web design, use of Linux on a laptop, computer gaming, digital art, electronic publishing, and machinima. Free wireless internet access was available. There were panels, tutorials, an &quot;installfest&quot; and featured guests who went head to head in a first person shooter elimination tournament (the &quot;celebrity fragfest&quot;).

Notable guests included actor Wil Wheaton, Jay &quot;Tron Guy&quot; Maynard, game designer Steve Jackson, and Linux activist Eric S. Raymond.

==Aftermath==
Financial difficulties and the departure of primary founder Rob Landley from Austin led to the shutdown of Linucon after the second event.

<doc id="465882" wikidata="Q504484" url="?curid=465882" title="Peter Burke (historian)">
<text>Ulick Peter Burke (born 16 August 1937) is a British polymath, historian and professor. He was born to a Roman Catholic father and Jewish mother (who later converted to Roman Catholicism).

He was educated by the Jesuits and at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford and was a doctoral candidate at St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford.

From 1962 to 1979, he was a member of the School of European Studies at University of Sussex, before moving to the University of Cambridge, where he holds the title of professor emeritus of cultural history and fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Burke is celebrated as a historian not only of the early modern era, but one who emphasizes the relevance of social and cultural history to modern issues. He is married to the Brazilian historian Maria Lúcia Garcia Pallares-Burke who is the author of two books (in one of which she collaborated with her husband).

Burke is not only known for his work on the Modern Age but also for his research on cultural history across its entire spectrum. As a polyglot, he has managed on the one hand to incorporate information from a good part of Europe and has also achieved good diffusion of his books. They have been translated into more than thirty languages. In 1998, he was awarded the Erasmus Medal of the European Academy, and is an honorary doctorate from the Universities of Lund, Copenhagen and Bucharest.

<text>Terling (pronounced Ter-ling) is a village and civil parish in the county of Essex, England, between Braintree to the north, Chelmsford to the south-west and Witham to the east.

== History ==
A settlement at Terling dates back to Roman times. According to a Saxon document dated 627 AD, about seven hundred acres of land was occupied in the Terling and Fairstead area. In 886 Terling was part of the Witham Hundred and there are references to this in records of Terling and Fairstead until the nineteenth century.

Terling is named in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Tarlinga&quot;, giving the approximate population as one hundred and twenty five. Before the Norman Conquest the three manors of Terling were presented to the Abbot of Ely. During the thirteenth century successive Bishops of Norwich acquired land in the Parish, by 1238 known as &quot;Tarlinges&quot;, and the remains of the foundations of their palace exist to the west of All Saints’ Church. Henry VII later used the palace as a hunting lodge.

During the fourteenth century more people were encouraged to take up farming and names of the farmers who purchased holdings at this time are remembered to this day in place names such as Loyes, Scarletts and Porridge Pot.

Arable farming and sheep rearing were the basis of the village economy in the sixteenth century. Other local industries included tanning, weaving, malting and the milling of flour. Houses of the period were made of timber and clay and were thatched.

Although yet un-standardised, by 1718 the spelling &quot;Tarling(e)&quot; was most common
. It is unclear when the present-day spelling &quot;Terling&quot; became pre-eminent in documents and maps, but the change came about over the course of the 18th century. For example, Robert Morden&#x27;s 1722 map of Essex, and Emanuel Bowen&#x27;s map of 1724 spell the name as &quot;Tarling&quot;, along with other placenames that are rendered in a phonetic spelling that accords with their pronunciation but, like Terling, is at variance with their modern spelling. Herman Moll&#x27;s map of 1733 introduces another variant, spelling it &quot;Tarleing&quot;. A later 18th-century map of Essex located in the Moot Hall in Maldon hedges its bets naming the village as &quot;Tarling or Terling&quot;, but defers to the phonetic spelling in naming &quot;Tarling Hall&quot;. A map of the Chelmsford and Witham Hundreds, dedicated to Sir William Mildmay Bt (of the Mildmay Baronets) in 1768 names the village as &quot;Tarling&quot;.

John Strutt, the second Baron Rayleigh, built the village school, enlarged the church and, in 1868, after a terrible epidemic of typhoid fever, installed a village water supply system.

Since 2002 Terling has been the location of the Terling International Trifle Festival, held each year in September.

Terling was named as Essex Village of the Year in 2017.

== The village ==
The village is split into two halves by the river Ter. P H Reaney suggests that the name of the river is a back-formation, taking its name from the settlement, rather than the other way round
. On the West side of the river there is a cricket pitch, tennis courts, swimming pool and playground. On the East side of the river is the village&#x27;s single public house, the Rayleigh Arms (commonly known as the Monkey), as well as a tearoom, the village shop and post office, the Terling Primary School and the Anglican Church.

== Population ==
In 1991 Terling had a population of 741, increasing to 764 at the 2011 Census.

== Notable buildings ==
The manor house, Terling Place, was built between 1772 and 1777.

The Terling windmill, latterly converted to residential use, was featured in the film &quot;Oh, Mr Porter!&quot;.

The Anglican church dedicated to All Saints is located on the village green. The body of the church is medieval, restored in the 19th century, while the brick-built tower dates from 1732.

<text>Stellantis Canada (formerly, FCA Canada, Inc. and Chrysler Canada) is the wholly owned subsidiary of Stellantis through its North American division operating in Canada. Incorporated in 1925, the Chrysler Corporation of Canada acquired a Maxwell-Chalmers plant in Windsor, Ontario that had been used to manufacture some Chrysler models in the previous year. Initially called Chrysler Canada, Ltd, the name of the company changed to DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. following the merger of the two parent automotive conglomerates. In August 2007, the company was renamed Chrysler Canada Incorporated when Cerberus Capital Management purchased 80.1% of its parent company Chrysler.

FCA Canada has three manufacturing plants in operation in Canada, and built 535,878 cars and trucks in 2002. In 2007, the company sold 232,688 vehicles in the Canadian market. In 2012, Stellantis Canada sales were 243,845, a 6% increase over 2011; this put the company into the #2 sales slot for Canada.

==History==
FCA Canada was established in mid-June 1925, with 181 employees. 7,857 vehicles were produced in the first year.

===&quot;Plodge&quot;===
Plodge, a portmanteau of the names Plymouth and Dodge, is a name informally used to refer to vehicles Chrysler Canada built with a mix of U.S. Plymouth and Dodge parts for the Canadian and export markets. This practice allowed dealers in Canada to offer a wider array of vehicles at lower development cost in the relatively small Canadian market. For example, a Plymouth with a Dodge grille and taillights became a Dodge without the expense of tooling a vehicle for the market. On the Dodge Dart introduced in 1960, only the interiors were shared; Canadian-market 1960-61 Darts had Plymouth dashboards. The 1965 to 1966 Dodge Monaco used a Dodge body, with a Plymouth Fury dashboard and interior trim. Not all Canadian-market Chrysler-built vehicles were badge engineered in this manner, however; the DeSoto Diplomat, for example—a rebadged Dodge Dart—was never sold in Canada, where DeSotos were similar to the US models. The Canadian 1960 DeSoto Adventurer looked like the American 1960 DeSoto but used the upholstery and door panels from the 1960 Chrysler Saratoga.

 The Valiant was sold by both Dodge and Plymouth dealers as a separate make, as had been the original plan in the United States. 1960 to 1962 Canadian Valiants were substantially the same as American models, with minor trim and mechanical equipment differences. 1963-64 Canadian Valiants had U.S. Valiant front sheetmetal on the U.S. Dart body. 1965 Canadian Valiants were available in the full range of sizes and models offered across the American Valiant and Dart models, but all Canadian-market cars used Dart instrument clusters and were badged &quot;Valiant&quot;. For 1966, the Valiant Barracuda was the only offering in Canada on the U.S. Valiant&#x27;s wheelbase, with no Valiant station wagons in Canada for 1966.

&quot;Plodge&quot; vehicles include:
*DeSoto Diplomat: Dodge Dart body, DeSoto-like side trim
*Dodge Kingsway: Dodge body, Plymouth fenders and trim
*Dodge Mayfair: Dodge front clip, Plymouth body
*Dodge Regent: Dodge front clip, Plymouth body
*Dodge Crusader: Dodge Front Clip (grille minus six &quot;teeth&quot;) Plymouth body
*Dodge Viscount: Dodge front clip, Plymouth body
*Dodge Monaco 1965-1966: Used 1965-1966 Plymouth Fury dashboard
*Valiant 1960-1966: parts mix varied by model year
*Dodge Dart 1960-1961: Plymouth instrument panel

Once the Canada–United States Automotive Products Agreement (the &quot;Auto Pact&quot;) took practical effect in 1967, virtually all differences ceased to exist between U.S. and Canadian Chrysler products. However, until the early 2000s the model distribution within and among marques was sometimes different in Canada than in the U.S. The Dodge and Plymouth Neon was sold in Canada as the Chrysler Neon; the Dodge Dynasty and Intrepid were likewise both badged and sold as Chrysler models in Canada. In 2003 this practice was stopped and the U.S. and Canadian marque and model ranges are fully aligned.

Historically, Stellantis Canada sold vehicles under the Dodge, Plymouth, Chrysler, DeSoto, Valiant, and Imperial marques. Presently there are four marques: Dodge, Ram, Jeep, and Chrysler. Dodge is the mainstream car and van line, Jeep is the main SUV range, Chrysler is the premium line, and Ram is the range of trucks and truck-based SUVs.

<doc id="465886" wikidata="Q815334" url="?curid=465886" title="Parietal lobe">
<text>The parietal lobe is one of the four major lobes of the cerebral cortex in the brain of mammals. The parietal lobe is positioned above the temporal lobe and behind the frontal lobe and central sulcus.

The parietal lobe integrates sensory information among various modalities, including spatial sense and navigation (proprioception), the main sensory receptive area for the sense of touch in the somatosensory cortex which is just posterior to the central sulcus in the postcentral gyrus, and the dorsal stream of the visual system. The major sensory inputs from the skin (touch, temperature, and pain receptors), relay through the thalamus to the parietal lobe.

Several areas of the parietal lobe are important in language processing. The somatosensory cortex can be illustrated as a distorted figure – the cortical homunculus (Latin: &quot;little man&quot;) in which the body parts are rendered according to how much of the somatosensory cortex is devoted to them. The superior parietal lobule and inferior parietal lobule are the primary areas of body or spatial awareness. A lesion commonly in the right superior or inferior parietal lobule leads to hemispatial neglect.

The name comes from the parietal bone, which is named from the Latin &quot;paries-,&quot; meaning &quot;wall&quot;.

== Structure ==

The parietal lobe is defined by three anatomical boundaries: The central sulcus separates the parietal lobe from the frontal lobe; the parieto-occipital sulcus separates the parietal and occipital lobes; the lateral sulcus (sylvian fissure) is the most lateral boundary, separating it from the temporal lobe; and the longitudinal fissure divides the two hemispheres. Within each hemisphere, the somatosensory cortex represents the skin area on the contralateral surface of the body.

Immediately posterior to the central sulcus, and the most anterior part of the parietal lobe, is the postcentral gyrus (Brodmann area 3), the primary somatosensory cortical area. Separating this from the posterior parietal cortex is the postcentral sulcus.

The posterior parietal cortex can be subdivided into the superior parietal lobule (Brodmann areas 5 + 7) and the inferior parietal lobule (39 + 40), separated by the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). The intraparietal sulcus and adjacent gyri are essential in guidance of limb and eye movement, and—based on cytoarchitectural and functional differences—is further divided into medial (MIP), lateral (LIP), ventral (VIP), and anterior (AIP) areas.

== Function ==
Functions of the parietal lobe include:
* Two point discrimination – through touch alone without other sensory input (e.g. visual)
* Graphesthesia – recognizing writing on skin by touch alone
* Touch localization (bilateral simultaneous stimulation)

The parietal lobe plays important roles in integrating sensory information from various parts of the body, knowledge of numbers and their relations, and in the manipulation of objects. Its function also includes processing information relating to the sense of touch. Portions of the parietal lobe are involved with visuospatial processing. Although multisensory in nature, the posterior parietal cortex is often referred to by vision scientists as the dorsal stream of vision (as opposed to the ventral stream in the temporal lobe). This dorsal stream has been called both the &quot;where&quot; stream (as in spatial vision) and the &quot;how&quot; stream (as in vision for action). The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) receives somatosensory and visual input, which then, through motor signals, controls movement of the arm, hand, and eyes.

Various studies in the 1990s found that different regions of the posterior parietal cortex in macaques represent different parts of space.
* The lateral intraparietal (LIP) area contains a map of neurons (retinotopically-coded when the eyes are fixed) representing the saliency of spatial locations, and attention to these spatial locations. It can be used by the oculomotor system for targeting eye movements, when appropriate.
* The ventral intraparietal (VIP) area receives input from a number of senses (visual, somatosensory, auditory, and vestibular). Neurons with tactile receptive fields represent space in a head-centered reference frame. The cells with visual receptive fields also fire with head-centered reference frames but possibly also with eye-centered coordinates
* The medial intraparietal (MIP) area neurons encode the location of a reach target in eye-centered coordinates.
* The anterior intraparietal (AIP) area contains neurons responsive to shape, size, and orientation of objects to be grasped as well as for manipulation of the hands themselves, both to viewed and remembered stimuli. The AIP has neurons that are responsible for grasping and manipulating objects through motor and visual inputs. The AIP and ventral premotor together are responsible for visuomotor transformations for actions of the hand.

More recent fMRI studies have shown that humans have similar functional regions in and around the intraparietal sulcus and parietal-occipital junction. The human &quot;parietal eye fields&quot; and &quot;parietal reach region&quot;, equivalent to LIP and MIP in the monkey, also appear to be organized in gaze-centered coordinates so that their goal-related activity is &quot;remapped&quot; when the eyes move.

Emerging evidence has linked processing in the inferior parietal lobe to declarative memory. Bilateral damage to this brain region does not cause amnesia however the strength of memory is diminished, details of complex events become harder to retrieve, and subjective confidence in memory is very low. This has been interpreted as reflecting either deficits in internal attention, deficits in subjective memory states, or problems with the computation that allows evidence to accumulate, thus allowing decisions to be made about internal representations.

==Clinical significance==
Features of parietal lobe lesions are as follows:
* Unilateral parietal lobe
** Contralateral hemisensory loss
** Astereognosis – inability to determine 3-D shape by touch.
** Agraphaesthesia – inability to &quot;read&quot; numbers or letters drawn on hand, with eyes shut.
** Contralateral homonymous inferior quadrantanopia
** Asymmetry of optokinetic nystagmus (OKN)
** Sensory seizures
* Dominant hemisphere
** Conduction aphasia
** Dyslexia – a general term for disorders that can involve difficulty in learning to read or interpret words, letters, and other symbols
** Apraxia – inability to perform complex movements in the presence of normal motor, sensory and cerebellar function
** Gerstmann syndrome – characterized by acalculia, agraphia, finger agnosia, and left-right disorientation
* Non-dominant hemisphere
** Contralateral hemispatial neglect
** Constructional apraxia
** Dress apraxia
** Anosognosia – lack of awareness of the existence of one&#x27;s disability
* Bilateral hemispheres
** Bálint&#x27;s syndrome

Damage to this lobe in the right hemisphere results in the loss of imagery, visualization of spatial relationships and neglect of left-side space and left side of the body. Even drawings may be neglected on the left side. Damage to this lobe in the left hemisphere will result in problems in mathematics, long reading, writing, and understanding symbols. The parietal association cortex enables individuals to read, write, and solve mathematical problems. The sensory inputs from the right side of the body go to the left side of the brain and vice versa.

The syndrome of hemispatial neglect is usually associated with large deficits of attention of the non-dominant hemisphere. Optic ataxia is associated with difficulties reaching toward objects in the visual field opposite to the side of the parietal damage. Some aspects of optic ataxia have been explained in terms of the functional organization described above.

Apraxia is a disorder of motor control which can be referred neither to &quot;elemental&quot; motor deficits nor to general cognitive impairment. The concept of apraxia was shaped by Hugo Liepmann. Apraxia is predominantly a symptom of left brain damage, but some symptoms of apraxia can also occur after right brain damage.

Amorphosynthesis is a loss of perception on one side of the body caused by a lesion in the parietal lobe. Usually, left-sided lesions cause agnosia, a full-body loss of perception, while right-sided lesions cause lack of recognition of the person&#x27;s left side and extrapersonal space. The term amorphosynthesis was coined by D. Denny-Brown to describe patients he studied in the 1950s.

Can also result in sensory impairment where one of the affected person&#x27;s senses (sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste and spatial awareness) is no longer normal.

<text>The 2003 Manitoba general election was held on June 3, 2003 to elect Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Manitoba, Canada. It was won by the New Democratic Party, which won 35 seats out of 57 (net gain of 3), securing another term for premier Gary Doer.

The Progressive Conservative Party finished second with twenty seats, a net loss of 4 from 1999. The Liberal Party won two seats, a net gain of one from the previous election. 

An article in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; attributed the NDP&#x27;s strong performance to premier Doer&#x27;s tenure, where he was seen as having &quot;delivered a reasonable economic performance and a steady stream of budget surpluses.&quot;

<text>Farmleigh is the official Irish state guest house. It was formerly one of the Dublin residences of the Guinness family. It is situated on an elevated position above the River Liffey to the northwest of the Phoenix Park, in Castleknock. The estate of consists of extensive private gardens with stands of mature cypress, pine and oak trees, a boating pond, walled garden, sunken garden, out offices and a herd of rare native Kerry cattle. It was purchased by the Government of Ireland from Edward Guinness, 4th Earl of Iveagh in 1999 for €29.2 million. A state body—the Office of Public Works (OPW)—spent in the region of €23 million restoring the house, gardens and curvilinear glasshouses, bringing the total cost to the state to €52.2 million. Farmleigh was opened to the public in July 2001.

==History==

Farmleigh was once a small (two-storey) Georgian house built in the mid-18th century. It originally belonged to the Coote and then Trench families. Farmleigh Bridge was added to the estate in the 1870s to carry electricity lines from the mill race turbine on the Strawberry Beds to the house.

In 1873, the house and estate were purchased by Edward Guinness (1847–1927) when he married his cousin Adelaide Guinness. He was a great-grandson of Arthur Guinness and was created Baron Iveagh in 1891, Viscount Iveagh in 1905 and Earl of Iveagh in 1919.

Guinness commissioned a major renovation and extension programme to extend the house to the west and add a third floor. These works took place between 1881 and 1884 and were completed to designs by Irish architect James Franklin Fuller. A ballroom was added in 1896, designed by the Scottish architect William Young. The conservatory was added in 1901.

As many of the house&#x27;s features were commissioned by Lord Iveagh, visitors gain some insight into his character from the landscaped gardens, classical architecture, and sober symmetrical layout. There are also tapestries on display, which the 1st Earl collected while travelling through Europe as a young man. The Earl&#x27;s library, on loan to the state, contains some of the earliest books printed in Ireland. Farmleigh eventually passed to Rupert Guinness, 2nd Earl of Iveagh, and remained in the ownership of the Guinness family throughout the rest of the 20th century.

==Current use==
The estate was purchased from the 4th Earl of Iveagh by the State in 1999. The official purpose for the €29.2 million purchase, and subsequent expenditure of €23 million in refurbishment, was that it would be used for state purposes. Specifically, it is designated as &quot;&quot;an official State guest house for visiting heads of State and dignitaries.&quot; Some notable visitors have been hosted at Farmleigh including the Premier of China, the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, the King of Malaysia, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the Governor-General of New Zealand, Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, and U.S. President Joe Biden. However, the estate only hosted seven visiting dignitaries in 2006 (the most in one year), six in 2008, and only two the following year. Also in 2009, 246,000 members of the public visited the estate.

In 2006 it was announced by the Office of Public Works (OPW) that the Steward&#x27;s Lodge which is located in the grounds of Farmleigh had been renovated. It was speculated at the time that the lodge was to become an official residence of the Taoiseach. Former Taoiseach Brian Cowen used the lodge for this purpose on occasion, staying at the lodge while in Dublin. His successor, Enda Kenny, has also stayed on occasion at the Steward&#x27;s Lodge.

Today Farmleigh is operated by the OPW and the estate and gardens are largely open to the public, with the house closed except for organised tours. Seasonal events, such as craft and food markets, are held on the grounds. The estate has also been used as the venue for the RTÉ proms, a public concert series that took place each summer in a large marquee erected on the grounds.

<text>Hubert of Liège (Latinized: &quot;Hubertus&quot;) ( 656 – 30 May 727 ) was a Christian saint who became the first bishop of Liège in 708 He is a patron saint of hunters, mathematicians, opticians and metalworkers. Known as the &quot;Apostle of the Ardennes&quot;, he was called upon, until the early 20th century, to cure rabies through the use of the traditional Saint Hubert&#x27;s Key.

Hubert was widely venerated during the Middle Ages.The iconography of his legend is entangled with the legend of the martyr Saint Eustace. The Bollandists published seven early lives of Hubert (&quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot;, November 3, 759 – 930 ); the first of these was the work of a contemporary, although it offers few details.

Hubert died 30 May 727 in or near a place called (in Latin) &quot;Fura&quot;. In the later Middle Ages, this location was claimed to have been identified as Tervuren near Brussels; recent scholarship, however, considers Voeren (Fourons), a location much closer to Liège than Brussels, to be the saint&#x27;s likelier resting place. His feast day is 3 November.

==Etymology of &quot;Hubert&quot;==

Hubert of Liège was a Frank; the Franks were originally a Germanic people.
Hubert is a Germanic masculine given name, from &quot;hug&quot; &quot;mind&quot; and &quot;beraht&quot; &quot;bright&quot;.

&quot;Hubertus&quot; is a Latinized form of &quot;Hubert&quot;. Other forms of the name include Hugubert, Hughbert, Hugo, Hubrecht, Hugubrecht, Hudson, and Hugh.

==Early life==
Hubert was born about the year 656, the eldest son of a Frankish duke. At the age of 10 he nearly died from a fever. As a youth, Hubert was sent to the Neustrian court of Theuderic III () at Paris, where his charm and agreeable address led to his investment with the dignity of &quot;count of the palace&quot;. Like many nobles of the time, Hubert was a hunting enthusiast.

About this time (682), Hubert married Floribanne, daughter of Dagobert, Count of Leuven. (Their son Floribert of Liège later would succeed his father as Bishop of Liège - in office: 727 to ; bishoprics were all but accounted as fiefs heritable in the great families of the Merovingian kingdoms.) Hubert moved to the Austrasian court where he was warmly welcomed by Pepin of Herstal, Mayor of the palace, who entitled him almost immediately Grand Master of the household.

==Spiritual conversion==

Hubert&#x27;s wife died giving birth to their son Floribert, and his grief prompted him to retreat from the court. He withdrew into the forests of the Ardennes and gave himself up entirely to hunting.

Legend holds that on a Good Friday morning, while the faithful were in church, Hubert was hunting in the forest. As he pursued a magnificent stag or hart, the animal turned and Hubert was astounded to see a crucifix floating between its antlers. He heard a voice saying: &quot;Hubert unless thou turnest to the Lord and leadest a holy life, thou shalt quickly go down into Hell.&quot; Hubert dismounted and prostrated himself, and after asking &quot;Lord, what wouldst Thou have me do?&quot; is told, &quot;Go and seek Lambert, and he will instruct you.&quot;

The story of the stag first appears in one of the later legendary hagiographies (&quot;Bibliotheca hagiographic Latina&quot;, nos. 3994–4002) and has been appropriated from the legend of Saint Eustace a.k.a. Placidus (Placidus was Eustace&#x27;s name before he was baptized). The stag story was only attributed to Saint Hubert in the 15th century.

==Religious career==
Hubert set out immediately for Maastricht, to meet Lambert, a bishop who received him kindly and became his spiritual director. Hubert renounced all his very considerable honors and gave up his birthright to the Aquitaine to his younger brother, Odo, whom he made guardian of his infant son, Floribert. Having distributed all his personal wealth among the poor, Lambert sent him to the Ardennes to live amongst the people and the forest creatures. Hubert studied for the priesthood, was ordained, and soon afterward became one of Lambert&#x27;s chief associates in the administration of his diocese. At the request of Lambert, Hubert made a pilgrimage to Rome in 708 in Lambert&#x27;s name, but during his absence, Lambert was assassinated in Liège by the followers of Pepin. According to the hagiographies of Hubert, this act was simultaneously revealed to the pope in a vision, together with an injunction to appoint Hubert bishop of Maastricht.

Hubert distributed his episcopal revenues among the poor, was diligent in fasting and prayer, and became well known for his eloquence in the pulpit. In 720, in obedience to a vision, Hubert translated St. Lambert&#x27;s remains from Maastricht to Liège with great pomp and ceremony, with several neighboring bishops assisting. A basilica for the relics was built upon the site of Lambert&#x27;s martyrdom, and was consecrated as a cathedral the following year, the see being removed from Maastricht to Liège, then only a small village. This laid the foundation of the future greatness of Liège, of which Lambert is honored as patron, and Hubert as founder and first bishop.

Hubert actively evangelized among pagans in the extensive Ardennes forests and in Toxandria, a district stretching from near Tongeren to the confluence of the rivers Waal and the Rhine. He gained the trust (and the faith) of its people through the outdoorsman skills he acquired in his hunting life. He became a sought authority whenever matters of the forest came up.
== Death ==
Hubert died peacefully in a place called &quot;Fura&quot;, located 30 miles from Liège, 30 May 727 or 728. Initially he was buried in the collegiate St Peter&#x27;s Church, Liège, but his bones were transported to the Benedictine Abbey of Amdain in the Ardennes in 825. The abbey became a locus for pilgrimages, until Hubert&#x27;s coffin disappeared during the Reformation. His feast day is 3 November, probably the date of the translation of his relics to Amdain.

==Veneration==
Hubert was widely venerated in the Middle Ages and partly because of his noble birth, several military orders were named after him: the Bavarian, the Bohemian International Order of St. Hubertus and that of the Archbishop-Elector of Cologne.

Hubert, along with Quirinus of Neuss, Cornelius and Anthony, was venerated as one of the Four Holy Marshals (&quot;Vier Marschälle Gottes&quot;) in the Rhineland.
 The &quot;St. Hubertus Orden&quot; (Order of Saint Hubert), a chivalric order, was founded in 1444 by Gerhard V of Jülich and Berg.

In the Anglican Communion, at least two churches have been dedicated to Saint Hubert within the Church of England.

===Patronage===
St. Hubert of Liège is a patron saint of archers; dogs; forest workers; trappers; hunting and huntsmen; opticians; mathematicians; metal workers; smelters and the city of Liège.

St. Hubert has been described as the patron saint of hunters and is honored by sportsmen as the originator of ethical hunting behavior. However, he renounced hunting after having his vision of encountering the stag, as it was believed that God had seen his hunting life as an unholy, sacrilegious one which would lead him to Hell. When Hubert became a priest, clergy were subsequently forbidden to hunt and if they did, would be required to do penance.

==Legacy==
Hubert is honored among sport hunters as the originator of ethical hunting behavior. In some versions of the story, the stag is said to have lectured Hubert to hold animals in higher regard and have compassion for them as God&#x27;s creatures with value in their own right. For example, the hunter ought to only shoot when a clean, quick, and therefore humane kill is assured. He ought to shoot only old stags which are past their prime breeding years and forego a much-anticipated shot on a trophy to instead euthanize a sick or injured animal that might appear on the scene. Further, one ought never to shoot a female with young in tow, to assure the young deer have a mother to guide them to food during the winter. Such is the legacy of Hubert, which is still taught today and who is held in high regard in the extensive, rigorous German and Austrian hunter education courses.

His legacy is also followed by the French &quot;chasse à courre&quot; (hunting with hounds) masters, huntsmen, and followers who hunt deer, boar, and roe on horseback and are the last direct heirs of Hubert in Europe. &quot;Chasse à courre&quot; is currently enjoying a revival in France. These hunters apply a specific set of ethics, rituals, rules, and tactics that date from the early Middle Ages. Hubert is venerated every year by the hunts in formal ceremonies.

In Belgium, the feast day of St Hubert (Fête de la Saint-Hubert, in French) is marked by blessings of horses, dogs, and other animals, not necessarily those involved with hunts.

The St. Hubert Club of Great Britain is dedicated to responsible deer management.

The St. Hubertus Club Chicago is a German cultural organization that promotes German heritage and hunting in the German tradition.

The Svätý Anton manor house, which houses a Forestry, Wood and Hunting Museum, hosts a festival, St. Hubertus Days each September in Svätý Anton, Slovakia.

Other institutions named after St. Hubert include St. Hubert Catholic School (Chanhassen, Minnesota), St. Hubert Catholic School (Hoffman Estates, Illinois), St Hubert Catholic High School For Girls (Philadelphia), St. Hubert School, (Calgary, Alberta, Canada), Saint-Hubert Flying College (Saint-Hubert, Quebec), Collège St-Hubert (Auderghem, Belgium), Our Lady &amp; St. Hubert&#x27;s Catholic Primary School (Dudley, England).

Catholic Concern for Animals confers awards annually to honor exceptional individuals who have made outstanding contributions towards advancing animal welfare and status in human society. In particular, their &quot;St Hubert Award&quot; recognizes persons who have given up activities that exploit animals to become examples of compassionate living.

<doc id="465896" wikidata="Q1632835" url="?curid=465896" title="Precuneus">
<text>In neuroanatomy, the precuneus is the portion of the superior parietal lobule on the medial surface of each brain hemisphere. It is located in front of the cuneus (the upper portion of the occipital lobe). The precuneus is bounded in front by the marginal branch of the cingulate sulcus, at the rear by the parieto-occipital sulcus, and underneath by the subparietal sulcus. It is involved with episodic memory, visuospatial processing, reflections upon self, and aspects of consciousness.

The location of the precuneus makes it difficult to study. Furthermore, it is rarely subject to isolated injury due to strokes, or trauma such as gunshot wounds. This has resulted in it being &quot;one of the less accurately mapped areas of the whole cortical surface&quot;. While originally described as homogeneous by Korbinian Brodmann, it is now appreciated to contain three subdivisions.

It is also known after Achille-Louis Foville as the &quot;quadrate lobule of Foville&quot;. The Latin form of was first used in 1868 and the English &quot;precuneus&quot; in 1879.

== Structure ==
The precuneus is located on the inside between the two cerebral hemispheres in the rear region between the somatosensory cortex and forward of the cuneus (which contains the visual cortex). It is above the posterior cingulate. Following Korbinian Brodmann it has traditionally been considered a homogeneous structure and with limited distinction between it and the neighboring posterior cingulate area. Brodmann mapped it as the medial continuation of lateral parietal area 7.

Axon tracing research on macaque monkeys has established that it consists of three subdivisions which now have been confirmed by fMRI upon resting-state functional connectivity to also exist in humans (parallel fMRI research has also been done upon monkeys).

=== Subdivisions ===
;Sensorimotor Anterior Region
This occurs around the margin of the cingulate sulcus (blue in figure) and is connected with sensorimotor areas of the cerebral cortex such as the paracentral lobule, supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, somatosensory area (Brodmann area 2), parietal operculum and insula. fMRI Research upon humans finds a connection with the caudalmost part of parahippocampus and superior temporal gyrus. No connections with the inferior parietal lobule, prefrontal cortex nor primary motor cortex.

;Cognitive/Associative Central Region
This occurs around the precuneal sulcus (green in figure) and is connected with the inferior parietal lobule particularly the angular gyrus and prefrontal areas 10, 46 and 8. No connections exist with premotor, motor, or somatosensory areas. The areas with which it links are involved in executive functions, working memory and motor planning.

;Visual Posterior Region
This occurs along the parieto-occipital fissure (yellow in figure). This connects with visual areas in the cuneus and primary visual cortex.

=== Subcortical connections ===
Below the cerebral cortex, the precuneus is connected with the dorsalmost nuclei of the thalamus, including the ventral lateral nucleus, the central and anterior nuclei of the intralaminar nuclear group, and the lateral pulvinar. Other connections include the claustrum, the dorsolateral caudate nucleus, putamen, and the zona incerta. It also has links with the brainstem areas such as the pretectal area, the superior colliculus, the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, and the basis pontis.

== Function ==
The mental imagery concerning the self has been located in the forward part of the precuneus with posterior areas being involved with episodic memory. Another area has been linked to visuospatial imagery. (It is not though clear how these—and the functions noted below—link with the above three subdivisions.)

The precuneus plays a role in itch sensations (there are many different types of itch) and their brain processing “‘We can’t [yet] pinpoint what the precuneus does in itch, but it’s uniquely activated with itch and not pain.’” 

=== Self ===
Functional imaging has linked the precuneus to the processes involved in self-consciousness, such as reflective self-awareness, that involve rating one&#x27;s own personality traits compared to those judged of other people.

Electrical stimulation of the anterior portion can induce an out of body experience.

=== Memory ===
The precuneus is involved in memory tasks, such as when people look at images and try to respond based on what they have remembered in regard to verbal questions about their spatial details. It is involved with the left prefrontal cortex in the recall of episodic memories including past episodes related to the self. The precuneus is also involved in source memory (in which the &quot;source&quot; circumstances of a memory are recalled) with the left inferior prefrontal cortex: here its role is postulated to be providing rich episodic contextual associations used by the prefrontal cortex to select the correct past memory. In the recollection of memories, it has been postulated that the precuneus discerns whether contextual information exists that can be useful for involving the aid of the hippocampus. Alternatively it has a different involvement when judging the familiarity as it decides whether the processing of perceptual features would be more useful. In this way the precuneus gets involved in diverse processes such as attention, episodic memory retrieval, working memory and conscious perception.

=== Visuospatial ===
The precuneus has been suggested to be involved in directing attention in space both when an individual makes movements and when imaging or preparing them. It is involved in motor imagery and shifting attention between motor targets. It is also involved in motor coordination that requires shifting attention to different spatial locations. It is also together with the dorsal premotor cortex involved in visuospatial mental operations (such as in a modified form of the game of Amidakuji). It is suggested that while the premotor area engages in the mental operation, the precuneus aids monitoring the success of that operation in terms of internally represented visual images.

The precuneus&#x27; role in mental imagery has been suggested to extend to that of modeling other people&#x27;s views. It is activated when a person takes a third-person versus first-person visual point of view. Together with the superior frontal gyrus and orbitofrontal cortex, the precuneus is activated when people make judgments that require understanding whether to act out of empathy and forgiveness.

===Executive functions===
Precuneus is thought to be related to response inhibition.

===Consciousness===
It has been suggested that together with the posterior cingulate, the precuneus is &quot;pivotal for conscious information processing&quot;. The evidence for this link with consciousness comes from the effects of its disruption in epilepsy, brain lesions and vegetative state. Also, cerebral glucose metabolism is at its highest in these two areas during wakefulness but is most reduced in them during anesthesia. In addition, it is one of the areas of the brain most deactivated during slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.

Together with the prefrontal cortex, the precuneus, is more activated upon the learning of words briefly flashed when they are supraliminal (and so enter consciousness) than subliminal (and so do not enter consciousness).

===Default network===
It has been suggested to be the &#x27;core node&#x27; or &#x27;hub&#x27; of the default mode network that is activated during &quot;resting consciousness&quot; in which people do not engage intentionally in sensory or motor activity. This involvement in the default network is suggested to underlie its role in self-consciousness. However its involvement in the default network has been questioned. Though one of the authors raising these doubts noted &quot;our findings in this regard should be treated as preliminary.&quot; A later study in 2012 showed that only ventral precuneus is involved in the default network.

=== Parietal prefrontal central hub===
Olaf Sporns and Ed Bullmore have proposed that its functions link to its role as a central and well connected &quot;small-world network&quot; hub between parietal and prefrontal regions. 
These clusters or modules are interlinked by specialized hub regions, ensuring that overall path lengths across the network are short. Most studies identified [such] hubs among parietal and prefrontal regions, providing a potential explanation for their well-documented activation by many cognitive functions. Particularly notable is the prominent structural role of the precuneus, a region that is homologous to the highly connected posteromedial cortex in the macaque. The precuneus is involved in self-referential processing, imagery and memory, and its deactivation is associated with anaesthetic-induced loss of consciousness. An intriguing hypothesis suggests that these functional aspects can be explained on the basis of its high centrality in the cortical network.
==Correlation of grey matter volume and subjective happiness score==
A positive relationship has been found between the volume of grey matter in the right precuneus and the subject&#x27;s subjective happiness score.

==Impact of mindfulness==
A 6-week mindfulness based intervention was found to correlate with a significant grey matter increase within the precuneus.

==Other animals==
The precuneus seems to be a recently expanded part of the brain, as in less developed primates such as New world monkeys &quot;the superior parietal and precuneate regions are poorly developed&quot;. It has been noted that &quot;the precuneus is more highly developed (i.e. comprises a larger portion of the brain volume) in human beings than in non-human primates or other animals, has the most complex columnar cortical organization and is among the last regions to myelinate&quot;.

<text>Rhaeto-Romance, Rheto-Romance, Rhaeto-Italian, or Rhaetian, is a purported subfamily of the Romance languages that is spoken in south-eastern Switzerland and north-eastern Italy. The name &quot;Rhaeto-Romance&quot; refers to the former Roman province of Raetia. The question of whether these languages actually form a subfamily is called the . The Italian linguist Graziadio Ascoli, writing in 1873, found them to share a number of intricacies and believed they formed a linguistic group. The Rhaeto-Romance languages differ from Italian in their evolution from Latin by having passed through a stage with phonemic vowel length, undergone certain consonant developments, and possibly developed a pair of central rounded vowels (now lost everywhere). If the subfamily is genuine, three languages would belong to it: Romansh in Switzerland, and Ladin and Friulian in Italy. Their combined number of speakers is about 660,000; the large majority of these (about 500,000) speak Friulian.

== Origin ==

Before the Roman conquest, the Alps were Celtic-speaking in the north and Rhaetian-speaking in the south. The area was incorporated into the Roman Empire during the reign of Augustus. The Rhaeto-Romance languages originated as a dialect of the provincial Latin of the central Alps.
By the end of the Roman Empire, there was an unbroken region of distinctive Romance speech here, which was gradually fragmented into secluded areas in the high valleys by the encroachment of German dialects from the north and of Gallo-Italic languages from the south.
Rhaeto-Romance was spoken over a much wider area during Charlemagne&#x27;s rule, stretching north into the present-day cantons of Glarus and St. Gallen, Walensee in the northwest, and Rüthi and the Alpine Rhine Valley in the northeast. In the east, parts of modern-day Vorarlberg were Romance speaking, as were parts of Austrian Tyrol. The northern areas of what is currently Switzerland, called &quot;Lower Raetia&quot; at that time, became German-speaking by the 12th century; and by the 15th century, the Rhine Valley of St. Gallen and the areas around the Walensee were entirely German-speaking. 
This language shift was a long, drawn-out process, with larger, central towns adopting German first, while the more peripheral areas around them remained Romansh-speaking longer. The shift to German was caused in particular by the influence of the local German-speaking elites and by German-speaking immigrants from the north, with the lower and rural classes retaining Romansh longer.

== Related languages ==

The family is most closely related to its nearest neighbors: French, Franco-Provençal, Occitan, Venetian, Istriot and Lombard.
A number of lexical items are shared with Ibero-Romance due to the similar date of Latinization for both regions, although it can also be explained by means of Bartoli&#x27;s areal linguistics theory, Ibero-Romance being a peripheral area, as are Balkano-Romance, Southern-Italian and Rhaeto-Romance, whereas Gallo-Romance and Italo-Romance are the central area. The Rhaeto-Romance languages were linked to other Romance languages that existed in bordering areas but have later disappeared, like the Moselle Romance and the Austrian Romance.

== History and classification ==

While the areas that now speak Friulian were originally inhabited by speakers of Venetic (likely Italic) and Celtic languages, the areas of Northeastern Italy that now speak Ladin initially spoke a non-Indo-European language called Raetic. Ladin and Romansh originate from the Vulgar Latin spoken by Roman soldiers during the conquests of Raetia.

=== Romansh ===
By the mid-9th century, Romansh was spoken over a far wider area. However, with the migration of many elite German land owners, Romansh dissipated across Northern Italy. The oldest literary text in the Romansh language is the &quot;Chianzun dalla guerra dagl Chiaste da Müs,&quot; which details the Musso War.

By 1803, the state of Grisons, which was 50% Romansh and 50% German-speaking, became a part of Switzerland. The strength of the central government of Grisons, whose official language was German, began to impose on the Romansh-speaking people, which resulted in many Romansh speakers adopting German. With the 20th century came a rise in tourism, which took the focus away from the region&#x27;s agricultural focus and resulted in German becoming the more practical language to learn. Many in the intellectual class found this to be beneficial to the local as Romansh appeared to hinder their intellectual development. As Heinrich Bansi, a notable priest in 1897, noted: &quot;The biggest obstacle to the moral and economical improvement of these regions is the language of the people.&quot; This viewpoint was countered with the belief that the Romansh language was a hybrid of both Italian and German, allowing the Romansh speakers to have a moderate understanding of the other two more widely used languages.

By the mid-19th century, amidst a dwindling Romansh-speaking population, a renaissance of sorts appeared. This culminated in the 1885 creation of an of all Romansh regions known as &quot;Società Retorumantscha.&quot; In 1919, the Lia Rumantscha was created to encompass all of the regional Romansh-speaking societies. In addition, more schools began to teach Romansh by the mid-19th century. In 1860, Romansh became a subject in a teachers&#x27; college and an officially recognized language in 1880.

Despite these efforts, with more and more of the surrounding area speaking German, the Lia Rumantscha created Romansh-speaking daycare schools in the 1940s. Unfortunately, this effort failed to deliver, and the last school was closed by 1979.

=== Friulian ===

Friulian traces its roots back to the Latin Aquileia. Prior to Roman contact in 181 BC the region of northeastern Italy was of Raetian, Italic and Celtic origins and used a form of either Raetian, Venetic or Celtic. The transition from Vulgar Latin to Friulian occurred in the 6th century CE. The first official use of Friulian can be traced back to the 13th century and by the 15th century a majority of the population spoke the language, while the noble classes continued to use Latin or German. In 1420, the area of Friuli transitioned under Venetian rule, and the Venetian dialect became the dominant language. As the influence of Venetian and Italian increased over the years, the Friulian language waned. Accelerating this decline currently is the ongoing loss of Friulian language teaching in higher education. 

An exception to this decline occurred in the mid 20th century when a devastating earthquake struck the local region. In the aftermath, many found solace in sharing their local Friulian language, thus renewing interest in it. The imprint of the language also remains on the local geography as many of the local towns and geographical landmarks (mountains, woods, animals, plants) were given Celtic names that survive to this day.

=== Ladin ===

Ladin was initially a vulgar Latin language from the Alps of northern Italy. Beginning in the 6th century, the Ladin language began to shrink due to the encroachment of Bavarian and Gallo-Italic languages, surviving in only the isolated mountainous areas. In the early Middle Ages, the Ladin region came under House of Habsburg and Republic of Venice rule. From these two influences, the Ladin area underwent the process of Germanisation.

By the end of World War I Italy had annexed the region that encompassed the Ladin language. With the nationalism of the 20th century, Ladin was considered by many Italians to be an Italian dialect. Benito Mussolini later pushed forward an Italianization of the region which further dwindled the Ladin language user base. Despite the small number of Ladin speakers, in 1972 the Italian government afforded Ladin the status of a secondary language.

== Geographic distribution ==

=== Romansh ===

Spoken in the Swiss canton of Graubünden by 60,561 people – 0.83% of the Swiss population – but this number is rapidly dropping.

=== Friulian ===

Spoken in Italy, most notably the provinces of Udine and Pordenone, by about 600,000 people.

=== Ladin ===
Spoken in northeastern Italy, in Trentino-Alto Adige and the Province of Belluno in Veneto, by about 41,000 people.
=== Official status ===

==== Romansh ====
The first Swiss constitution of 1848 along with its revision of 1872 neglected to mention the Romansh language; however, it was translated into two Romansh dialects after the first revision. In 1938 Romansh became a national language, though a delineation was made between &quot;national&quot; and &quot;official&quot; languages. National languages were largely symbolic while official languages (French, German, and Italian) were used in an official capacity by the government. One notable disadvantage of being a national, rather than official language was that parents would have to register their children&#x27;s names under one of the official languages.

By 1996 Romansh was recognized as an official language beside French, German and Italian, and Rhaeto-Romansh is now the official correspondence used when communicating with Romansh people.

At this time the Canton of Grison is the only place where Romansh is the official language. This allows for any citizen to request official documents from the local government in the Romansh language.

==== Friulian ====
An official language of the autonomous region of Friuli, it has protected status, and is used in all forms of education in the region. Still used at popular levels for daily conversation.

==== Ladin ====
Ladin is recognized by both provincial and national law in Italy. In the early 1990s Italy signed European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages which is meant to protect and promote minority languages such as Ladin.

=== Dialects ===
==== Romansh ====
* Sursilvan
* Putèr
* Vallader
* Surmiran
* Sutsilvan

==== Friulian ====

* Central Friulian, spoken in the Udine province.
* Northern Friulian, spoken in Carnia.
* Southeastern Friulian, spoken in areas along the Isonzo river.
* Western Friulian, spoken in the Pordenone province.

==== Ladin ====
* Athesian group of the Sella, spoken in South Tyrol.
* Trentinian group of the Sella, spoken in the Fassa Valley.
* Agordino group of the Sella, spoken most prominently Livinallongo del Col di Lana and Colle Santa Lucia.
* Ampezzan group, spoken in Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo.
* Cadorino group, spoken in Cadore and Comelico.
* Nones and Solando group, spoken in In Western Trentino, in Non Valley, Val di Sole, Val di Peio, Val di Rabbi, and Val Rendena.

==Varieties==
The area where Rhaeto-Romance languages (also called Ladin languages in a wider sense, not to be confused with Ladino or Judaeo-Spanish) were spoken during the Middle Ages stretched from Switzerland to the Julian Alps (in modern-day western Slovenia).

The Rhaeto-Romance languages can be distinguished into the following varieties:

* Romansh: Switzerland. In Switzerland, Romansh is one of country&#x27;s four national languages; however, its usage is rather limited to the canton of Graubünden (). It is composed of the following dialects:
** Puter (Engadin valley)
** Vallader (Engadin valley)
** Surmiran
** Sursilvan
** Sutsilvan
** Rumantsch Grischun, the standardized literary language, constructed by the Swiss linguist Heinrich Schmid in 1982.
* Ladin: 
** Dolomitic Ladin in Italy (in Trentino, South Tyrol and the province of Belluno)
* Friulian: Friuli region, Italy

A phylogenetic classification using basic lexicon identifies a primary split between Romansh in Switzerland and Ladin in Italy. One secondary split distinguishes Engadinic from the other Romansh varieties in Switzerland. In Italy, another secondary split is evidently caused by the Dolomite mountain range that divides Ladin into a northern and a southern subbranch, with Friulian being grouped closest to the southern branch.

In this study, the divergence of the Rhaeto-Romance languages from their reconstructed lexical ancestor is about 7% on average. This would correspond to a time depth of about 500 years if the glottochronological replacement rate of 14% per millennium for Romance were trustworthy. However, the earliest available Romance text from the Alpine area is somewhat older and dates to AD 1200.

== Phonology ==

=== Romansh ===
The Romansh language has up to 26 consonant phonemes. Word stress occurs either on the last or second to last syllable.

=== Friulian ===
=== Ladin ===
== Grammar ==
=== Morphology ===

==== Romansh ====
In Romansh word order directs the grammar rather than the noun being inflected. Additionally, similar to most other Romance languages there are two genders in addition to &quot;s&quot; being used to indicate a plural word.

==== Friulian ====
Similar to Italian and Spanish, most Friulian nouns end in a vowel based on the gender, with feminine nouns ending in &quot;e&quot; while masculine nouns end in &quot;i&quot;.

=== Syntax ===
The general word order is subject-verb-object, however this can change at times where the verb can come before the subject.

== Vocabulary ==

=== Romansh ===

Many place names in Romansh date back before Roman contact stemming from Raetic and Celtic origins.

=== Friulian ===

Most words in Friulian are of the Romance variety due to its Latin roots; however, it still has many place names and flora that trace back to Raetic, Venetic and Celtic origins.

<doc id="465901" wikidata="Q282925" url="?curid=465901" title="The Hollies">
<text>The Hollies are an English rock and pop band formed in Manchester 1962. One of the leading British groups of the 1960s and into the mid-1970s, they are known for their distinctive three-part vocal harmony style. Singer Allan Clarke and rhythm guitarist/singer Graham Nash founded the band as a Merseybeat-type group in Manchester, although some of the band members came from towns further north, in east Lancashire. Nash left the group in 1968 to co-form Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, though he has reunited with the Hollies on occasion. As well as Clarke and Nash other members have included lead guitarist Tony Hicks, rhythm guitarist Terry Sylvester (who replaced Nash), bassists Eric Haydock and Bernie Calvert, and drummers Don Rathbone and Bobby Elliott. 

The Hollies enjoyed considerable popularity in the UK and Europe during the mid-1960s with a string of hits that included &quot;Just One Look&quot;, &quot;Here I Go Again&quot; (both 1964), &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; (1965; their first of two UK number ones), &quot;Look Through Any Window&quot; (1965) and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Let Go&quot; (1966), although they did not achieve US chart success until &quot;Bus Stop&quot; was released in 1966. The group went on to have periodic success on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean over the next decade with hits such as &quot;Stop Stop Stop&quot; (1966), &quot;On a Carousel&quot;, &quot;Carrie Anne&quot; (both 1967), &quot;He Ain&#x27;t Heavy, He&#x27;s My Brother&quot; (1969), &quot;Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Air That I Breathe&quot; (1974). &quot;He Ain&#x27;t Heavy&quot; reached number one on the UK Singles Chart following a 1988 re-release. Overall, the Hollies had over 30 charting singles reach the UK Singles Chart, 22 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and 21 on the chart of &quot;RPM&quot; magazine in Canada.

The Hollies are one of the few UK groups of the early 1960s, along with the Rolling Stones, who have never disbanded and continue to record and perform. In recognition of their achievements, the Hollies were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010.

==Origin==
The Hollies originated as a duo formed by Allan Clarke and Graham Nash, who were best friends from primary school and began performing together during the skiffle craze of the late 1950s. Eventually Clarke and Nash became a vocal-and-guitar duo modelled on American duo the Everly Brothers, working as &quot;Ricky and Dane Young&quot;; under this name they teamed up with a local band, the Fourtones, consisting of Pete Bocking on guitar, John &#x27;Butch&#x27; Mepham on bass, Keith Bates on drums, and Derek Quinn on guitar. When Quinn quit to join Freddie and the Dreamers in 1962, Clarke and Nash also quit and joined another Manchester band, the Deltas, consisting of Vic Steele on lead guitar, Eric Haydock on bass guitar, and Don Rathbone on drums, which had just lost two members including Eric Stewart, who left to join a &quot;professional&quot; band, the Mindbenders. During these periods the group were managed and promoted by Michael Cohen, a music enthusiast and clothing retailer from Oldham.

The Deltas first called themselves the Hollies for a December 1962 gig at the Oasis Club in Manchester. It has been suggested that Eric Haydock named the group in relation to a Christmas holly garland, though in a 2009 interview Graham Nash said that the group decided just prior to a performance to call themselves the Hollies because of their admiration for Buddy Holly. In 2009, Nash wrote, &quot;We called ourselves The Hollies, after Buddy and Christmas.&quot;

==1963–1968==

In January 1963, the Hollies performed at the Cavern Club in Liverpool, where they were seen by Parlophone assistant producer Ron Richards, who had been involved in producing the first Beatles session. Richards offered them an audition with Parlophone, but Steele did not want to be a &quot;professional&quot; musician and left the band in April 1963. For the audition, they brought in Tony Hicks to replace the departing Steele. Hicks played in a Nelson band called the Dolphins, which also featured Bobby Elliott on drums and Bernie Calvert on bass. Not only were the Hollies signed by Richards, who continued to produce the band until 1976 and once more in 1979, but a song from the audition, a cover of the Coasters&#x27; 1961 single &quot;(Ain&#x27;t That) Just Like Me&quot;, was released as their debut single in May 1963 and hit No. 25 on the UK Singles Chart.

Their second single, another Coasters cover, this time 1957&#x27;s &quot;Searchin&#x27;&quot;, hit No. 12. At this point, after recording only eight songs for Parlophone, Rathbone also decided to leave the band, and Hicks was able to arrange for his Dolphins bandmate Bobby Elliott to replace him as the Hollies&#x27; new drummer in August 1963. They then scored their first British Top 10 hit in early 1964 with a cover of Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs&#x27; &quot;Stay&quot;, which reached No. 8 in the UK. It was lifted from the band&#x27;s Parlophone debut album, &quot;Stay with the Hollies&quot;, released on 1 January 1964, which went to No. 2 on the UK album chart.

The Hollies became known for making cover versions, and they followed up with &quot;Just One Look&quot; (February 1964, UK No. 2), a song that had already had top 10 success in the US for Soul star Doris Troy. The hits continued with &quot;Here I Go Again&quot; (May 1964, UK No. 4). At this point, there was some North American interest in the group, and versions of &quot;Stay with the Hollies&quot;, with these two singles added, were issued in both Canada (by Capitol Records) and the US (by Imperial Records), with the title changed to &quot;Here I Go Again&quot;. Like their Parlophone labelmates the Beatles, the Hollies&#x27; albums released in North America remained very different from their UK counterparts.

By this time, the Hollies were writing and performing a substantial amount of original material, written by the group&#x27;s songwriting team of Clarke, Nash, and Hicks, and producer Richards finally permitted the group to release its first self-penned hit, &quot;We&#x27;re Through&quot; (Sep. 1964, UK No. 7) (credited to a pseudonym, &quot;L. Ransford&quot;, the name of Graham Nash&#x27;s grandfather, as were all their early compositions). This was followed by two more cover versions, &quot;Yes I Will&quot; (Jan. 1965, UK No. 9) and finally the Clint Ballard, Jr.-penned &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; (May 1965, the band&#x27;s first UK No. 1, US No. 103, Canada No. 11). Their second album, &quot;In the Hollies Style&quot; (1964), did not feature in the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; top ten album chart, although it did reach the top ten of the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; chart. None of the tracks from the album were released in the US, although a version of it was released in Canada, with the addition of the British singles.

Finally, the Hollies broke through in North America with an original song that they requested from Manchester&#x27;s Graham Gouldman. &quot;Look Through Any Window&quot; (September 1965, UK No. 4) broke the Hollies into the US Top 40 (No. 32, Jan. 1966) and into the Canadian top 10 (No. 3, Jan. 1966), both for the first time. Their follow-up single, an original recording of George Harrison&#x27;s new song &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; (December 1965), was undercut when the Beatles decided to release their own version on the UK album &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;; it only reached No. 20 in the UK and was not released in North America. Their third album, simply called &quot;Hollies&quot;, hit No. 8 in the UK in 1965 but, under the name &quot;Hear! Here!&quot;, failed to chart in the US despite its inclusion of &quot;Look Through Any Window&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot;.

The Hollies then returned to the UK Top 10 with &quot;I Can&#x27;t Let Go&quot; (Feb. 1966, UK No. 2, US No. 42). Their fourth album, &quot;Would You Believe?&quot; which included the hit, made it to No. 16 in 1966. Released in the US as &quot;Beat Group!&quot;, it also failed to crack the US top 100.

At this point, a dispute between the Hollies and their management broke out over what bass guitarist Eric Haydock contended were excessive fees being charged to the group by management. As a result, Haydock decided to take a leave of absence from the group. While he was gone, the group brought in the Beatles&#x27; good friend Klaus Voormann to play on a few gigs and recorded two singles with fill-ins on bass: the Burt Bacharach-Hal David song &quot;After the Fox&quot; (Sep. 1966), which featured Peter Sellers on vocals, Jack Bruce on electric bass and Burt Bacharach himself on keyboards, and was the theme song from the Sellers film of the same name (which failed to chart), and &quot;Bus Stop&quot; (UK No. 5, US No. 5, June 1966), another Gouldman song, which featured Bernie Calvert, a former bandmate of Hicks and Elliott in the Dolphins, on bass. Calvert also played a tour of Yugoslavia with the band in May 1966.

&quot;Bus Stop&quot; gave the Hollies their first US top ten single. As a result, a US/Canadian &quot;Bus Stop&quot; album, made of the single mixed with unreleased songs from earlier in the band&#x27;s career, climbed to No. 75—the group&#x27;s first album to enter the US Top 100. Although Haydock ultimately proved to be correct about the fee dispute, he was sacked in early July 1966 in favour of Calvert after &quot;Bus Stop&quot; became a huge hit.

At the time of Haydock&#x27;s departure, Clarke, Nash and Hicks participated (along with session guitarist Jimmy Page, bass guitarist John Paul Jones and pianist Elton John) in the recording of the Everly Brothers&#x27; 1966 album &quot;Two Yanks in England&quot;, which consisted largely of covers of &quot;L. Ransford&quot; compositions. After the Everly Brothers album, the Hollies stopped publishing original songs under a pseudonym, and from this point until Nash&#x27;s last single with the Hollies in 1968, all of their single A-sides were original compositions, except the final Nash era single &#x27;Listen To Me&#x27; (1968) which was written by Tony Hazzard.

In October 1966, the group&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;For Certain Because&quot; (UK No. 23, 1966), became their first album consisting entirely of original compositions by Clarke, Nash and Hicks. Released in the US as &quot;Stop! Stop! Stop!&quot;, it reached No. 91 there and spawned a US release-only single, &quot;Pay You Back with Interest&quot;, which was a modest hit, peaking at No. 28. Another track, &quot;Tell Me to My Face&quot;, was a moderate hit by Mercury artist Keith, and was also covered a decade later by Dan Fogelberg and Tim Weisberg on their &quot;Twin Sons of Different Mothers&quot; album.

Meanwhile, the Hollies continued to release a steady stream of international hit singles: &quot;Stop Stop Stop&quot; (Oct. 1966, UK No. 2, US No. 7) from &quot;For Certain Because&quot;, known for its distinctive banjo arrangement; &quot;On a Carousel&quot; (Feb. 1967; UK No. 4, 1967, US No. 11, Australia No. 14); &quot;Carrie Anne&quot; (May 1967, UK No. 3, US No. 9, Australia No. 7).

In mid-February 1967, Bobby Elliott collapsed on stage due to an inflamed appendix. The Hollies were forced to continue their touring commitments without him, using Tony Mansfield, Dougie Wright and Tony Newman as stand-ins for further live dates, and Wright, Mitch Mitchell and Clem Cattini when they began recording for their next album, &quot;Evolution&quot;, which was released on 1 June 1967, the same day as the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. It was also their first album for their new US label Epic, and reached No. 13 in the UK and No. 43 in the US. The US version included the single &quot;Carrie Anne&quot;. In addition, the Searchers and Paul &amp; Barry Ryan each had a minor UK chart hit covering the &quot;Evolution&quot; song &quot;Have You Ever Loved Somebody&quot; in 1967.

Also in 1967, the Hollies participated in the Festival di San Remo with the song &quot;Non prego per me&quot;, written by Italian songwriter Lucio Battisti and Italian lyricist Mogol.

Nash&#x27;s attempt to expand the band&#x27;s range with a more ambitious composition, &quot;King Midas in Reverse&quot;, only reached No. 18 in the UK charts. The Hollies then released the ambitious, psychedelic album &quot;Butterfly&quot;, retitled for the US market as &quot;King Midas in Reverse/Dear Eloise&quot;, but it failed to chart. In response, Clarke and Nash wrote a more conventional pop song, &quot;Jennifer Eccles&quot; (named after their wives) (Mar. 1968, UK No. 7, US No. 40, Australia No. 13), which was a hit. The Hollies donated a Clarke-Nash song, &quot;Wings&quot;, to &quot;No One&#x27;s Gonna Change Our World&quot;, a charity album in aid of the World Wildlife Fund, in 1969.

==Graham Nash departure==
In addition to his Hollies work, Graham Nash co-wrote John Walker&#x27;s first solo hit &quot;Annabella&quot; in 1967, and the following year sang on the Scaffold&#x27;s UK chart-topper, &quot;Lily the Pink&quot; (which referenced &quot;Jennifer Eccles&quot;). The failure of &quot;King Midas in Reverse&quot; had increased tension within the band, with Clarke and Hicks wanting to record more &quot;pop&quot; material than Nash did. Matters reached a head when the band rejected Nash&#x27;s &quot;Marrakesh Express&quot; and then decided to record an album made up entirely of Bob Dylan covers. Nash did take part in one Dylan cover, &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot;, but made no secret of his disdain for the idea and repeatedly clashed with producer Ron Richards.

In August 1968, the Hollies recorded &quot;Listen to Me&quot; (written by Tony Hazzard) (Sept. 1968, UK No. 11), which featured Nicky Hopkins on piano. That proved to be Nash&#x27;s last recording session with the Hollies; he officially left the group to move to Los Angeles, where he tentatively planned to become primarily a songwriter, after a performance in a charity concert at the London Palladium on 8 December 1968. Nash told &quot;Disc&quot; magazine, &quot;I can&#x27;t take touring any more. I just want to sit at home and write songs. I don&#x27;t really care what the rest of the group think.&quot; After relocating to Los Angeles, he joined with former Buffalo Springfield guitarist Stephen Stills and ex-Byrds singer and guitarist David Crosby to form one of the first supergroups, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, which released &quot;Marrakesh Express&quot; as its debut single.

The B-side of &quot;Listen to Me&quot; was &quot;Do the Best You Can&quot;, the last original recording of a Clarke-Hicks-Nash song to appear on a Hollies record (although &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot;, written by Clarke-Hicks-Nash, was re-cut with Terry Sylvester and issued as a US single in 1970).

Graham Nash was replaced in the Hollies in January 1969 by Terry Sylvester, formerly of the Escorts and the Swinging Blue Jeans. Sylvester also substituted for Nash as part of the group&#x27;s songwriting team, with Clarke and Hicks. As planned before Nash&#x27;s departure, the group&#x27;s next album was &quot;Hollies Sing Dylan&quot;, which reached No. 3 on the UK chart, while the US version, &quot;Words and Music by Bob Dylan&quot;, was ignored.

Nash&#x27;s departure saw the Hollies again turn to outside writers for their single A-sides, but the group&#x27;s British chart fortunes rallied during 1969 and 1970, and they scored four consecutive UK Top 20 hits (including two consecutive Top 5 placings) in this period, beginning with the Geoff Stephens/Tony Macaulay song, &quot;Sorry Suzanne&quot; (Feb. 1969), which reached No. 3 in the UK. The follow-up was the emotional ballad &quot;He Ain&#x27;t Heavy, He&#x27;s My Brother&quot; written by Bobby Scott and Bob Russell, which featured the piano playing of Elton John; it reached No. 3 in the UK in October 1969, and No. 7 in the US in March 1970. The next album &quot;Hollies Sing Hollies&quot; did not chart in the UK, but did well in the US—where it reached No. 32 after being retitled &quot;He Ain&#x27;t Heavy, He&#x27;s My Brother&quot; and including that song—and in Canada.

==1970s==

The Hollies&#x27; next single, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Tell the Bottom from the Top&quot;, again featured the young Elton John on piano and reached UK No. 7 in May 1970, charting in twelve countries. The UK hits continued with &quot;Gasoline Alley Bred&quot; (written by Cook/Greenaway/Macaulay) (Oct. 1970, UK No. 14, Australia No. 20), while the Tony Hicks song &quot;Too Young to Be Married&quot; – merely an album track in the UK and the US – became a No. 1 single in Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia, also reaching No. 9 in Singapore. Allan Clarke&#x27;s hard-edged rocker &quot;Hey Willy&quot; made No. 22 in the UK in 1971 and charted in eight other countries.

Like Graham Nash before him, frontman Allan Clarke by 1971 was growing frustrated, and he too began clashing with producer Ron Richards over material; after seeing Nash&#x27;s success since departing, he was eager to leave the group and cut a solo album. After the 1971 album &quot;Distant Light&quot;, which concluded the band&#x27;s EMI/Parlophone contract in the UK (and reached No. 21 on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; chart), Clarke departed from the Hollies in December.

The Hollies signed with Polydor for the UK/Europe in 1972, although their US contract with Epic still had three more albums to run. Swedish singer Mikael Rickfors, formerly of the group Bamboo (who had supported the Hollies in Sweden in 1967), was quickly recruited by the rest of the band and sang lead on the group&#x27;s first Polydor single &quot;The Baby&quot; (UK No. 26, March 1972). When Mikael first auditioned for them, he tried to sing in Allan Clarke&#x27;s higher vocal range, and the results were terrible. The rest of the group decided it might be better to record songs with him starting from scratch. Terry Sylvester and Tony Hicks blended with Rickfors&#x27; baritone voice instead of him trying to imitate Clarke&#x27;s tenor voice.

Meanwhile, in a counter-programming move, Parlophone lifted a Clarke-composed track from the previously unsuccessful album &quot;Distant Light&quot; that also featured Clarke on lead vocals and lead guitar, the Creedence Clearwater Revival-inspired &quot;Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress&quot;. Parlophone released this as a rival single to &quot;The Baby&quot; in February 1972, although it was only moderately successful in the UK (No. 32). In the US, Epic, which owned the rights to &quot;Distant Light&quot; but had not released it, finally released the album in April 1972 and the single in May 1972. Surprisingly, the song became a smash hit outside of Europe, peaking at No. 2 in the US (the Hollies&#x27; highest-charting single in the US) and Australia.

&quot;Long Dark Road&quot; is another track from &quot;Distant Light&quot;, with lead vocals by Clarke. It was released as a US single in fall 1972, reaching No. 26.

Meanwhile, the Rickfors-led Hollies released their first album &quot;Romany&quot; (which reached No. 84 in the US) in October 1972. A second Rickfors-sung single, &quot;Magic Woman Touch&quot; (1972), failed to chart in the UK, becoming the band&#x27;s first official single to miss the UK charts since 1963, although it did chart in seven other countries, reaching the Top Ten in the Netherlands, New Zealand and Hong Kong.

A second Rickfors/Hollies album, &quot;Out on the Road&quot; (1973), was recorded and issued in Germany. Clarke rejoined the band in the summer of 1973, and Rickfors left.

After Clarke&#x27;s return, the Hollies returned to the UK Top 30 with a song penned by Clarke: &quot;The Day That Curly Billy Shot Down Crazy Sam McGee&quot; (UK No. 24, 1973). In 1974 they scored what was to be their last major new US and UK hit single with the Albert Hammond/Mike Hazlewood-composed love song &quot;The Air That I Breathe&quot; (previously recorded by Hammond and by Phil Everly on his 1973 solo album, &quot;Star Spangled Springer&quot;), which reached No. 2 in the UK and Australia and made the Top 10 in the US. The single &quot;Another Night&quot;, produced by Alan Parsons, which was released after the aforementioned single, appeared on &quot;Billboard&quot; Rock Singles Best Sellers chart at no. 32 on 28 July 1975 and peaked at no. 71 on the publication&#x27;s Hot 100.

After the US failure of the Hollies&#x27; single &quot;4th of July, Asbury Park&quot;, written by Bruce Springsteen, Epic gave up on the Hollies in the US, combining their two 1976 albums into their last US release of the decade, &quot;Clarke, Hicks, Sylvester, Calvert, Elliott&quot;.

The Hollies continued to have singles chart hits during the rest of the seventies, although mostly in Europe as well as in New Zealand where they performed and recorded in 1975/76. In 1976, for example, the group released three singles in three different styles, none of which charted in the UK or the US. &quot;Star&quot; charted only in New Zealand and Australia, &quot;Daddy Don&#x27;t Mind&quot; charted only in the Netherlands and Germany, and &quot;Wiggle That Wotsit&quot; charted only in the Netherlands, Sweden, and New Zealand.

==1980s–1990==

In 1980, the Hollies returned to the UK charts with the single &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Song&quot;, written and produced by Mike Batt, which was a minor hit in 1980 reaching No. 58 in the UK. They also released an album of Buddy Holly covers named &quot;Buddy Holly&quot;.

In May 1981, Calvert and Sylvester left the group. Alan Coates joined the band on rhythm guitar and high harmony vocals shortly afterwards.

The Hollies went back into the studio on 6 June 1981 with singer/writer/guitarist John Miles and session bassist Alan Jones to record &quot;Carrie&quot; and &quot;Driver&quot;. But neither one of these songs was released at this time (&quot;Carrie&quot; appeared as the B-side of the re-released &quot;He Ain&#x27;t Heavy&quot; in 1988).

In August 1981, the remaining Hollies released &quot;Holliedaze&quot; on EMI, a medley edited together by Tony Hicks from their hit records, which returned them to the UK Top 30. At the request of the BBC, Nash and Haydock briefly rejoined in September 1981 to promote the record on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. The Hollies issued their last Polydor single &quot;Take My Love and Run&quot; (written by keyboard player Brian Chatton, who also appeared with the Hollies while they promoted the single on TV) in November 1981, but this failed to chart.

Graham Nash joined them for the recording of an Alan Tarney song, &quot;Somethin&#x27; Ain&#x27;t Right&quot;, on 10 September 1982, which led to a proper reunion album, &quot;What Goes Around...&quot;, issued on WEA Records. Nash continued appearing with the Hollies through early 1984, culminating in the Hollies&#x27; last hit in the US Top 40 with a remake of the Supremes&#x27; &quot;Stop in the Name of Love&quot;, which reached No. 29 in 1983. &quot;Stop in the Name of Love&quot; was taken from &quot;What Goes Around...&quot;, which was released in July 1983 and charted in the US on the &quot;Billboard&quot; top 200 albums at No. 90. A live album featuring the Clarke-Hicks-Elliott-Nash re-grouping, &quot;Reunion&quot;, was recorded at Kings Island Amusement Park in Ohio, during a US tour that followed that same year, finally being issued first in 1997 as &quot;Archive Alive&quot;, then retitled &quot;Reunion&quot; (with two extra tracks) in 2004.

The Hollies continued to tour and perform through the 1980s.

After its use in a TV beer commercial (for Miller Lite lager) in 1988, &quot;He Ain&#x27;t Heavy&quot; was reissued in the UK and reached No. 1. By this time, bassist Ray Stiles, formerly a member of 1970s glam rock group Mud, had joined the permanent line-up.

A compilation album, &quot;All the Hits &amp; More: The Definitive Collection&quot;, was released in 1988 and charted in the UK.

== 1990s–present ==
In 1993, the Hollies had their 30th anniversary as a band. A compilation album, &quot;The Air That I Breathe: The Very Best of the Hollies&quot;, charted at No. 15 in the UK. This album included a new single, &quot;The Woman I Love&quot;, which charted at No. 42 in the UK. Graham Nash again reunited with the Hollies to record a new version of &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; that featured prerecorded lead vocals by Buddy Holly, taken from an &#x27;alternate&#x27; version of the song given to Nash by Holly&#x27;s widow, María Elena Holly. This &quot;Buddy Holly &amp; the Hollies&quot; recording opened the &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; tribute album to Holly by various artists. The Hollies also continued to tour and make TV appearances.

The Hollies were awarded an Ivor Novello Award in 1995 for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.

Allan Clarke retired in February 2000. He was replaced by Carl Wayne, former lead singer of the Move. A New Zealand &quot;Hollies Greatest Hits&quot; compilation made No. 1 in that country in 2001, dislodging the Beatles&#x27; &quot;1&quot; collection from the top spot. While re-establishing the band as a touring attraction over 2000 to mid-2004, Carl Wayne only recorded one song with them, &quot;How Do I Survive?&quot; the last (and only new) track on the 2003 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (which reached No. 21 on the UK Albums Chart). After Wayne&#x27;s death from cancer in August 2004, he was replaced by Peter Howarth. Shortly afterward, Alan Coates left the band and was replaced by Steve Lauri.

The Hollies charted at No. 21 in the UK in 2003 with the compilation album &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; from EMI in CD format. (EMI has released most of the Hollies&#x27; EMI music on CD over the past 25 years.)

The Hollies were inducted into the &#x27;Vocal Group Hall of Fame&#x27; in the US in 2006. Also in 2006, the Hollies&#x27; first new studio album since 1983, &quot;Staying Power&quot;, was released by EMI featuring Peter Howarth on lead vocals.

The group released a studio album, &quot;Then, Now, Always&quot;, in late March 2009, again featuring Peter Howarth on lead vocals. The album was later given an official release by EMI in 2010 with the addition of an extra original song, &quot;She&#x27;d Kill for Me&quot;.

In recognition of their achievements, the Hollies were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010. In the same year, a compilation album, &quot;Midas Touch: The Very Best of the Hollies&quot;, charted in the UK at No. 23.

In 2012, the Hollies released &quot;Hollies Live Hits! We Got the Tunes!&quot;, a live double CD featuring the Hollies&#x27; live performances recorded during the band&#x27;s 2012 UK tour.

In 2013, the Hollies&#x27; 50th year was packed with a worldwide 50th Anniversary Concert Tour performing over 60 concerts.

In 2014, EMI released a 3CD compilation; &quot;50 at Fifty&quot; which concluded with one new song; &quot;Skylarks&quot; written by Bobby Elliott, Peter Howarth and Steve Vickers.

Original bassist Eric Haydock died on 5 January 2019 at the age of 75.

During 2021, two new books were published, each detailing the career of the band. The first was Bobby Elliott&#x27;s autobiography &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Heavy, It&#x27;s My Story&quot;, which told the story through his own perspective. The second was by UK author Malcolm C. Searles, entitled &quot;Riding the Carousel&quot;, which covered the entire career of the group across its 600 pages.

Original drummer Don Rathbone died in September 2024 at the age of 87.

==In the United States==

The Hollies were one of the last of the major British Invasion groups to have significant chart success in the United States. Their first single was not issued in the US and, although they had a minor US hit in 1964 with &quot;Just One Look&quot;, it was not until &quot;Look Through Any Window&quot; that the band reached the US Top 40. Many of their early singles that had been major hits in the UK, including &quot;Here I Go Again&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot;, &quot;Yes I Will&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re Through&quot;, failed to even reach the Top 100 in the US.

From 1966 until after they signed to Epic in 1967, the band had their most concentrated success in the US, including four Top 15 songs (&quot;Bus Stop&quot;, &quot;Stop Stop Stop&quot;, &quot;On a Carousel&quot;, and &quot;Carrie Anne&quot;). After this streak ended, they had a few more huge hits: &quot;He Ain&#x27;t Heavy, He&#x27;s My Brother&quot; (No. 7, 1969), &quot;Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress&quot; (No. 2, 1972), and &quot;The Air That I Breathe&quot; (No. 6, 1974). Additional US chart hits were the non-UK singles &quot;Pay You Back with Interest&quot; (No. 28, 1966), &quot;Dear Eloise&quot; (No. 50 in 1967), &quot;Long Dark Road&quot; (No. 26, 1972), and the &quot;reunion&quot; single &quot;Stop! In the Name of Love&quot; (No. 29, 1983).

==Rock and Roll Hall of Fame==

<doc id="465902" wikidata="Q1388598" url="?curid=465902" title="Alexandre Luigini">
<text>Alexandre Clément Léon Joseph Luigini (9 March 185029 July 1906) was a French composer and conductor, especially active in the opera house. As a composer, he is now remembered almost solely for his &quot;Ballet égyptien&quot;.

==Life and career==
Luigini was born in Lyon in 1850. His grandparents had moved to Lyon from Modena, Italy, when his grandfather took up the post of trumpeter with the orchestra of the Grand Théâtre. Alexandre Luigini was brought up with music, his father Joseph also playing with, and later conducting, the orchestra of the Grand Théâtre. He was the nephew of César and (another) Alexandre Luigini, both noted instrumentalists. His daughter was the harpist Caroline Luigini, who married the painter Victor Tardieu. His grandson is the poet Jean Tardieu.

After studying at the Conservatoire in Paris where he gained a second prize for violin, Luigini returned to Lyon and from 1872 played as a violinist in the theatre orchestra, which he went on to lead, becoming conductor in 1877. As resident conductor he was also expected to meet the compositional demands of the theatre, leading to a number of ballets, operas and orchestral suites. In 1879 he was appointed professor of harmony and composition at the Conservatory of Lyon.

In 1897 he left Lyon to take up the conductorship of the Opéra-Comique in Paris, and led a busy life until his sudden death there in 1906. At the Opéra-Comique he notably conducted the world premiere of Jules Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Cendrillon&quot; on 24 May 1899. The other premieres he conducted were &quot;Aphrodite&quot; 1906, &quot;Enfant roi&quot; 1905, &quot;Le Juif polonais&quot; 1900, &quot;Miarka&quot; 1905, &quot;Muguette&quot; 1903, and &quot;L&#x27;Ouragan&quot; 1901. He also supervised revivals of &quot;Alceste&quot;, &quot;Falstaff&quot;, &quot;Fidelio&quot;, &quot;Le Roi d’Ys&quot; and &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;, among others. Paris premieres conducted by Luigini included &quot;Chérubin&quot;, &quot;Hélène&quot;, &quot;Le jongleur de Notre-Dame&quot; and the first staging of &quot;Marie-Madeleine&quot;.

As a theatre conductor he followed the old practice of having his conductor’s stand directly against the prompt box.

Luigini&#x27;s &quot;Ballet égyptien&quot; (1875) is his best known work, gaining great popularity in the early 20th century as a concert suite. It originally gained prominence when it was included in the second act of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; for a performance in Lyon in 1886.

His compositions reflect his stage-orchestra background, being mostly light music for ballet and operas: &quot;Ange et démon&quot;, &quot;Le Rêve de Nicette&quot;, &quot;Les Caprices de Margot&quot; (one-act opéra comique, Lyon, 1877), &quot;Reine des fleurs&quot;, &quot;Fleurs et papillons&quot;, &quot;Les Écharpes&quot;, &quot;Le Meunier&quot;, &quot;Arlequin écolier&quot;, &quot;Faublas&quot; (three-act operetta, Théâtre Cluny, Paris, 1881). He also composed a number of songs and works for string quartet and other chamber groups.

<text>The Chief Whip is a political leader whose task is to enforce the whipping system, which aims to ensure that legislators who are members of a political party attend and vote on legislation as the party leadership prescribes.

== United Kingdom ==

In British politics, the Chief Whip of the governing party in the House of Commons is usually also appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, a Cabinet position. The Government Chief Whip has an official residence at 12 Downing Street, however their offices are located at 9 Downing Street.

The Chief Whip can wield great power over their party&#x27;s MPs, including cabinet ministers, being seen to speak at all times on behalf of the Prime Minister. Margaret Thatcher was known for using her Chief Whip as a &quot;cabinet enforcer&quot;.

The role of the Chief Whip is regarded as secretive, as the Whip is concerned with the discipline of their own party&#x27;s Members of Parliament, never appearing on television or radio in their capacity as whip. An exception occurred on 1 April 2019 when Julian Smith chose to criticise his own government and Prime Minister. Whips in the House of Commons do not, by convention, speak in debates.

The Government Chief Whip is assisted by the Deputy Chief Whip, other whips, and assistant whips. In order to provide the whip with a salary, the government whips are appointed to positions in HM Treasury and in the Royal Household under the Lord Steward of the Household. The whips are not fully active in either of these departments, though they do undertake a number of responsibilities. The Deputy Chief Whip is Treasurer of HM Household, the next two whips are Comptroller of HM Household and Vice-Chamberlain of HM Household. The remaining whips are Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. Assistant whips, and whips of opposition parties, generally do not receive such appointments. 

The Government Chief Whip in the House of Lords also holds the role of Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms, while the Government Deputy Chief Whip in the Lords holds the role of Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard. Other whips, who are fewer in number due to the decreased importance of party discipline in the Lords, are appointed as Lords in Waiting, if men, and Baronesses in Waiting, if women. As well as their duties as whips, Lords whips speak in the chamber (unlike Commons whips) to support departmental ministers, or act as a spokesperson for government departments with no minister in the Lords.

Outside the government, the Official Opposition Chief Whip in the Commons, like the Leader of the Opposition, receives a stipend in addition to their parliamentary salary, because their additional responsibilities will make them unable to hold down another job.

The whips, although superficially dictatorial, act as communicators between backbenchers and the party leadership. Ultimately, if backbenchers are unhappy with the leadership&#x27;s position, they can threaten to revolt during a vote and force the leadership to compromise.

While the whip was formally introduced to British politics by the Irish Parliamentary Party under Charles Stewart Parnell in the 1880s, in 1846 the Duke of Wellington advised the new Conservative Party leader Lord Stanley to ensure that his &quot;whippers-in&quot; were personally loyal. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the use of the term &quot;whippers-in&quot; was first recorded in the parliamentary sense in the Annual Register of 1772.&lt;ref name=&quot;SN/PC/02829&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Whip as a Party Line===

In the UK House of Commons, the importance of a vote is indicated by underlining items on the &quot;whip&quot;, which is the name of the letter the Chief Whip sends to all the MPs in their party at the start of the week. This letter informs them of the schedule for the days ahead and includes the sentence &quot;Your attendance is absolutely essential&quot; next to each debate in which there will be a vote. This sentence is underlined once, twice, or three times depending on the consequences that will be suffered if they do not turn up, hence the origin of the terms &quot;one-line whip&quot;, &quot;two-line whip&quot; and &quot;three-line whip&quot;. The actual vote they are to make is communicated to them in the chamber by hand signals during the division when the time comes (usually after the division bell has been rung). Neither these instructions, which are visible to everyone in the chamber, nor the &quot;whip&quot; letter at the start of the week, are recorded in &quot;Hansard&quot;, as they are considered a matter internal to the political party. Any explicit direction to an MP as to how they should vote would be a breach of parliamentary privilege.

The consequences of defying the party whip depend on the circumstances and are usually negotiated with the party whip in advance. The party whip&#x27;s job is to ensure the outcome of the vote. The party in the majority can always win a vote if its members obey the whip.

If the party has a large Commons majority, it can make allowances for MPs who are away on important business, or whose political circumstances require them to take a particular issue very seriously. Theoretically at least, expulsion from the party is an automatic consequence of defying a three-line whip.

Other such offences include betraying party loyalties. An example of this during John Major&#x27;s government was when nine Conservative MPs had the whip removed after voting against the government on its stance on the Maastricht Treaty, becoming known as Eurosceptics. In practice they remained Conservative MPs supporting the government on other issues. Sir Bill Cash, Sir John Redwood and Sir Iain Duncan Smith are still Conservative MPs. This was also the only time when MPs who were being whipped were cooperating with the opposite side&#x27;s whips. In most cases, the &#x27;pairing&#x27; system enables one from each side to cancel out the other&#x27;s vote if absent simultaneously. Despite the whip, individuals are entitled to vote according to their own beliefs, particularly when there is a &quot;free vote&quot; on a matter of conscience.

There are some cases in which the whip is removed because an issue is a matter of conscience. These include adoption, religion and equal opportunities. The impact of a whip being imposed on a matter of conscience can be damaging for a party leader. One such case was that of Iain Duncan Smith, who imposed a three-line whip against the adoption of children by unmarried couples which, at the time, meant gay couples could never adopt. Several Conservative MPs voted against the official party line, and Smith&#x27;s authority was weakened.

Whips often employ a mixture of promises, cajoling and persuasion to force an unpopular vote. A whip should know major figures in an MP&#x27;s local constituency party and the MP&#x27;s agent. There have been cases where sick MPs were wheeled into the House from far afield to vote for the government on a crucial vote. Former MP Joe Ashton recalled a case from the latter days of James Callaghan&#x27;s government:

I remember the famous case of Leslie Spriggs, the then-Member for St. Helens. We had a tied vote, and he was brought to the House in an ambulance having suffered a severe heart attack. The two Whips went out to look in the ambulance and there was Leslie Spriggs lying there as though he was dead. I believe that John Stradling Thomas said to Joe Harper, &quot;How do we know that he is alive?&quot; So, he leaned forward, turned the knob on the heart machine, the green light went around, and he said, &quot;There, you&#x27;ve lost—it&#x27;s 311.&quot; That is an absolutely true story. It is the sort of nonsense that used to happen. No one believes it, but it is true.

A minister who defies the whip is generally dismissed from their job immediately, if they have not already resigned, and returns to being a backbencher. Sometimes their votes in Parliament are called the &quot;payroll vote&quot;, because they can be taken for granted. The consequences for a back-bencher can include the lack of future promotion to a government post, a reduction of party campaigning effort in his or her constituency during the next election, deselection by his or her local party activists, or, in extreme circumstances, &quot;withdrawal of the whip&quot; and expulsion from the party.

=== Principal Private Secretary to the Chief Whip ===
The Government Chief Whip&#x27;s office is headed by a Principal Private Secretary, who also acts as a go-between for ministers and the opposition to keep parliamentary business moving. The first officeholder, Charles Harris, was appointed privately in 1919 to assist Lord Edmund Talbot, the Conservative chief whip. He was retained by successive Conservative chief whips on a private basis, serving as their secretary during periods when the party was in government (1922–23, 1924–29 and 1935 onwards) until 1939, when the post formally became part of the civil service (as Assistant to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury) and Harris was appointed into it, with a salary of £850. He retired in 1961 and was succeeded by Freddie Warren; all subsequent appointees have been permanent civil servants.

* 1939–1961: Sir Charles Harris, KBE
* 1961–1978: Sir Freddie Warren, CBE
* 1978–2000: Sir Murdo Maclean
* 2000–2021: Sir Roy Stone, CBE

== India ==
In India, the concept of the whip was inherited from colonial British rule. Every major political party appoints a whip who is responsible for the party&#x27;s discipline and behaviour on the floor of the house. Usually, that person directs the party members to stick to the party&#x27;s stand on certain issues and directs them to vote as per the direction of senior party members. However, there are some cases, such as Indian presidential election, where no whip can be issued to direct Member of Parliament or Member of the Legislative Assembly on whom to vote.

<text>Luigi Malerba (11 November 1927 – 8 May 2008), born Luigi Bonardi, was an Italian author known for his short stories, historical novels, and screenplays. He was a prominent figure in the Neoavanguardia movement and co-founded &quot;Gruppo 63&quot;, a literary collective influenced by Marxism and Structuralism.
Some of his most renowned works include La scoperta dell&#x27;alfabeto, The Serpent, What Is This Buzzing, Do You Hear It Too?, Dopo il pescecane, Testa d&#x27;argento, Il fuoco greco, Le pietre volanti, Roman Ghosts, and Ithaca Forever: Penelope Speaks. Malerba also wrote several stories and novels for children, collaborating on some of them with Tonino Guerra.

He was the first writer to win the Prix Médicis étranger in 1970. He received several prestigious awards, including the Brancati Prize in 1979, the in 1987, the Grinzane Cavour Prize in 1989 (alongside Stefano Jacomuzzi and Raffaele La Capria), the Viareggio Prize in 1992, the Flaiano Prize in 1990, and the in 1992. In 2000, his name appeared among the candidates for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

== The memory ==
An amusing writer, Malerba was a curious man—curious about language, history, customs, plots, and the coincidences of life. Unsurprisingly, he ventured into novels, linguistic essays, screenplays for cinema and television, and children&#x27;s literature. 

Umberto Eco said about him: &quot;Many have associated Malerba with post-modern authors, but this classification is inaccurate. The author of &quot;What Is This Buzzing, Do You Hear It Too?&quot; always behaves in a maliciously ironic way, employing subterfuges and ambiguities&quot;.&quot; He was one of the most important exponents of the Italian literary movement called Neoavanguardia, along with Balestrini, Sanguineti, and Manganelli.

Paolo Mauri wrote about him: &quot;Malerba operated within the Neoavanguardia: he liked the idea of turning old narratives upside down and pursuing new, experimental solutions. With his novels The Serpent and What Is This Buzzing, Do You Hear It Too?, he began to play on the thread of paradox, where investigations lead to nothing, heroes are born from the writer&#x27;s mind and made to live on the page only to reveal an unexpected trick and a new, absolutely original language. From novel to novel, he would then continue, constantly renewing his themes and style.&quot;

<doc id="465910" wikidata="Q1507974" url="?curid=465910" title="Tel Aviv Stock Exchange">
<text>The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE; ), colloquially known as The Bursa, is the only public stock exchange in Israel and a public company itself, listed on its own exchange since August 1, 2019. It is regulated by the &quot;Securities Law (1968)&quot; and is under the direct supervision of the Israel Securities Authority (ISA).

The TASE plays a significant role in the Israeli economy, facilitating the trade of securities and the raising of capital and debt for companies and the government on the Israeli capital market. Trading on the TASE is conducted exclusively through its 23 members, which include major banks and investment houses that collect a fee for their services.

The TASE was founded in 1953, with its precursor dating back to 1935. As of 2021, it lists 473 companies, 901 series of corporate bonds, 204 series of government bonds, 416 index-tracking products, and 1,231 mutual funds. The exchange&#x27;s market capitalization for equities stands at US$ 216 billion, and for bonds at US$ 196 billion.

==History and milestones ==

The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange was established in 1953. Even prior to this, commencing in 1935, securities trading was carried out in the Land of Israel and, afterwards, in the State of Israel at the mandate-period Anglo-Palestine Bank (today, Bank Leumi). The trade was conducted at the bank, in the office of Mordechai Pinchas Hasson, an Israeli banker who was one of the founders of the Exchange Bureau of Securities and the CEO of Bank Leumi. In the office that served as the stock exchange, daily trading within the framework of the &quot;Exchange Bureau of Securities&quot; lasted for just one hour. Among those that conceived the original idea were bankers who had immigrated from Germany such as Max Kollenscher and his brother Leo. In 1968, TASE activity was regulated by law and the Israel Securities Authority, which supervises TASE activity, was established.

In 1983, TASE was hit by the bank stock crisis, during which the share price of Israel&#x27;s four largest banks collapsed – resulting in the state&#x27;s nationalization of the banks and a third of the public&#x27;s investment in them being wiped out. In the same year, TASE moved from its premises at 113 Allenby Street to a building at 54 Ahad Ha&#x27;Am Street, Tel Aviv. In 1993, trade in derivatives commenced. In 1999, TASE brought down the curtain on the trading floors era and completed the changeover to fully automated trading making use of a &quot;continuous&quot; trading system (TACT). In 2000, the Knesset passed Amendment No. 21 to the Securities Law, which makes it easier for companies whose shares are listed in the United States, to also list in Tel Aviv (&quot;dual listing&quot;). In July 2005, dual listing was expanded to include companies listed on the London Stock Exchange&#x27;s Main Market and the Nasdaq Small Cap Market. Today, tens of dual-listed companies are traded on TASE (being listed in Tel Aviv and on overseas exchanges, in parallel). In 2005, market makers began operating on TASE. In 2007, the annual volume of securities and convertibles hit a new record of NIS 593.2 billion.

Since 2008, against the backdrop of the global economic crisis, the tightening of the regulatory regime in which TASE operates (by the Israel Securities Authority, the Capital Market, Insurance and Savings Division at the Israeli Ministry of Finance, the Anti-Money Laundering Authority, etc.) and other factors, the number of trading participants and trading volumes have become less significant. In 2012, the annual volume of securities and convertibles amounted to just NIS 265.1 billion (a 54% decrease) – the lowest volume since 2004.

In 2016, TASE launched an analysis project for high-tech companies, within the framework of which the international research company, Frost and Sullivan, publishes informational and financial analyses regarding technology and biomed companies that are listed on TASE.

In 2017, the TASE indices underwent a reform – &quot;the diffusion reform&quot;, which had several objectives, including: improving the stability of the TASE indices, broadening the sectoral diffusion within the various indices, setting more stringent threshold terms for the flagship indices and easing the threshold terms for the other indices, encouraging foreign investors to invest in the TASE indices, significantly increasing the free float rate for the shares included in the flagship indices, fully realizing the potential of small and medium company shares, and enlarging the infrastructure for launching new indices. At the beginning of 2017, the Knesset passed the second and third readings of a law for TASE&#x27;s demutualization, which created the outline for turning it into a for-profit company.

In April 2017, the Knesset passed an amendment of the Securities Law enabling changes to TASE&#x27;s ownership structure; in September 2017 the District Court ratified the TASE demutualization arrangement, enabling changes to TASE&#x27;s ownership structure, whereby TASE became a for-profit company, while separating the ownership and control of TASE from membership therein. The Israel Securities Authority has regulatory oversight over TASE&#x27;s operations, as well as over the Tel-Aviv Clearing House, the MAOF Clearing House and the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange Nominee Company, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of TASE.

In 2018, the Nominee Company was established as a private subsidiary of TASE. The Nominee Company is engaged in two main areas of activity: it ensures the proper and complete registration of the number of securities registered in its name (held by the public) and serves as a conduit for the transfer of payments deriving from corporate actions (such as dividends, interest) between the issuing companies and the end-holders of the securities. In August 2018, the Israel Securities Authority approved] the sale of 71.7% of TASE&#x27;s shares to five groups of foreign investors. On August 1, 2019, trade in TASE shares commenced on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange.

The 2017 indices reform

At the beginning of 2017, TASE carried out a comprehensive reform of the security indices listed on it and established new indices. Among the principal changes made by the reform was expanding the number of shares included in each index and lowering a share&#x27;s maximum weighing in an index. For instance, the Tel Aviv 25 Index, which was considered TASE&#x27;s flagship index was expanded from 25 to 35 shares, with its name being changed to the TA- 35 Index, accordingly. The maximum weighting for a share in the Index was reduced from 10% to 7%. One of the main objectives of the reform was to reduce the level of concentration in the indices. Since more than 70% of the Index&#x27;s weighting related to just 10 shares, a sharp change in the value of just one of these would cause the Index to react dramatically, and the Index was considered to be too concentrated.

As part of the reform, new indices were created with the aim of raising investors&#x27; interest in TASE and increasing activity thereon. The new indices that were created are: the TA-BlueChip15Price, the TA-SME150 and the TA Rimon indices.

=== TASE members ===
The Israeli Stock Exchange has 23 members

The central Bank of Israel 
=== TASE&#x27;s home ===
In 1960, TASE moved to its own premises in the &quot;Passage&quot; at 113 Allenby Street in Tel Aviv and, in February 1983, TASE moved premises to 54 Ahad Ha&#x27;Am Street in Tel Aviv. In 2001, a Visitors Centers was opened on the historic trading floors of the TASE building. Educational visits took place in the Visitors Center, as well as conventions and events associated with the capital market[

On July 24, 2014, TASE moved to its new home on the corner of Montefiore Street and Ahuzat Bayit Street, close to the Shalom Meir Tower. The TASE complex stands on a one and a half dunam plot that was acquired by it in 2007 at a cost of NIS 58 million and construction took five years. The 14 story building tops out at 60 meters and has 22,600 m2 of floor space. The nonstandard ratio between the number of stories and the building&#x27;s height is due to the building having stories with high ceilings, such as the ground floor that rises to a height of 10 meters.

==Growth==
In 1993 TASE had the third largest number of IPOs of all the world stock exchanges.

In 2005, non-Israeli investment in TASE reached an all-time high of NIS 2 billion, while the TA-25 increased 34%. By the end of the year foreign investment banks UBS, Deutsche Bank, and HSBC had become members of TASE.

In 2007, trading averaged $500 million a day, a 55% increase over the previous year. The number of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) grew to 240. The Tel Bond-20 index was also launched that year. The TA-25 rose 175% in the period 2004–07.

In May 2008 Northern Trust started the first US exchange-traded fund on the NYSE based on TASE&#x27;s benchmark, the TA-25 Index.

===Performance===
As of May 25, 2010, TASE&#x27;s largest stocks by market capitalization were Teva Pharmaceutical Industries ($51.5 billion), Israel Chemicals ($14.3bn), Bank Leumi ($6.1bn), and Bezeq ($6.0bn). Daily turnover of shares and convertibles in 2009 was US$432 million, $1,035M of bonds and exchange-traded notes (ETNs), $163M of T-bills, and 252,000 options and futures contracts. Total market capitalization at the end of 2009 was $189bn shares and convertibles, $174bn government and corporate bonds, and $23bn T-bills, a total of $386bn. On April 25, 2010, TASE&#x27;s TA-25 index reached a record high of 1,239 points.

For the decade ending 12 February 2012, the TA–25 index topped the Bloomberg Riskless Return Ranking list, outperforming 23 other developed-nation benchmark indexes when adjusting for volatility.

CEO Ester Levanon resigned on 18 July 2013, effective 31 December 2013. A week later, on 25 July 2013, Chairman Saul Bronfeld resigned. According to Bloomberg, the executives&#x27; decisions follow a drop in trading volume and the bourse&#x27;s failed bid to join MSCI Inc.&#x27;s Europe Index. Bronfeld, who served as chairman since 2006, cited the &quot;hostile control&quot; by the Israel Securities Authority and the regulator&#x27;s interference in the executive management of the bourse as the main reasons for his resignation.

Increase in trading volumes in 2020

The average daily trading volume on the equities market in 2020 amounted to approximately NIS 1.9 billion, some 35% higher than the average volume in the years 2015–2019 (that amounted to approximately NIS 1.4 billion per day). The major contributor to the rise in trading volumes was global coronavirus pandemic, which reached Israel in February 2020, and led to a steep increase in trading volatility on the markets.

Growth in the number of retail accounts with Israeli members of TASE in 2020

The Israeli capital market was stormed by the local retail public in 2020, which opened a significantly greater number of new accounts with TASE members than in 2019. Some 141,000 new accounts were opened by the general public during 2020, compared to some 98,000 new accounts in 2019, a 44% increase. The pace at which non-bank members acquired new members – some 170% more than in 2019 – was particularly noticeable. Among the banks, the growth was 36% up on the previous year.

==== Dividend Distribution in 2023 ====
In 2023, despite significant events such as war and legal reform, about 40% of the companies listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange continued to distribute dividends to their shareholders. This included notable dividends in the energy, oil and gas sectors, as well as in the banking and financial services sector.

The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange reported that 206 listed companies distributed dividends totalling approximately 27.2 billion shekels in 2023. This was slightly less than the all-time high recorded in 2022 when 233 companies distributed about 28.6 billion shekels. Despite these uncertainties, the percentage of public holdings in traded stocks on the exchange has gradually increased over the recent years, reaching 63.3% by the end of 2023. This trend contributed significantly to an increase in the proportion of dividends received by the public.

The year 2023 also marked a record in the total dividends distributed to public shareholders, which was about 62% of the distributed sum (16.8 billion shekels), as opposed to approximately 55% of the dividends (15.8 billion shekels) in 2022. The remaining dividends were paid to stakeholders. The average dividend yield of the listed companies in 2023 amounted to approximately 2.9%, compared to about 2.8% in the previous year. This was the highest yield since 2017, topping the yield of the record year of 2022. The market value in 2023 was approximately 9% lower than in 2022, while the total dividend was only about 5% lower than the previous year.

===International agreements===
In February 2007 the TASE signed a formal memorandum of understanding with the London Stock Exchange intended to smooth the trading of securities listed on both exchanges. At the time, 50 Israeli companies were listed on the London Stock Exchange. A similar memorandum of understanding was signed with The Nasdaq Stock Market in November 2007. NASDAQ at the time had 70 Israeli companies listed on the exchange, with a combined global market capitalization of over US$60 billion.

In July 2008, the TASE entered into a memorandum of understanding with NYSE Euronext. At the time seven Israeli companies traded on the NYSE.

 In November 2008 the TASE and the Shanghai Stock Exchange signed a memorandum of understanding, with delegations to be sent to each other&#x27;s markets to deepen understanding and promote trade. In February 2010, the TASE and the Toronto Stock Exchange signed a memorandum of understanding, committing to the cultivation of stronger ties between the two exchanges.

== Trading and features ==

=== Operating hours ===
TASE only operates from Sunday through Thursday. TASE does not operate on Friday as it is a short workday. TASE also does not operate on Israeli national and religious holidays[2]. Every so often, the idea of changing the trading days is raised such that TASE would not operate on Sundays and would operate on Fridays. The reasons for proposing this change include the relatively low trading volume on Sundays, due mainly to the world&#x27;s main stock exchanges not operating on Sundays.

The TASE trading schedule on workdays is divided into five phases: &quot;Pre-opening&quot;, &quot;Opening auction&quot;, &quot;Continuous trading&quot;, &quot;Pre-closing&quot;, and &quot;Closing auction&quot;

On the days when operations are conducted, trading is executed between the hours of 9:25 in the morning (derivatives – from 9:45) and 17:25 in the afternoon (and for derivatives – 17:35) local time (GMT+2).

Since March 8, 2020, trading on Sundays occasionally ends at between 15:49 and 15:50 local time (GMT+2). Correspondingly, derivatives trading on such Sundays ends 35 minutes earlier, viz. at 16:00 on local time (GMT+2).

Calcalist reported in May 2024 that TASE is expected to begin operating also on fridays. This will allow TASE to be included in the European MSCI.

=== Products ===
Several financial products are traded on TASE:

* Equities: A security that represents a share of a company&#x27;s ownership. 
* Bonds: A security that represents a loan granted to the issuer of the security, with pre-determined repayments terms and interest.
* Corporate bonds: bonds issued by a company.
* Government bonds: bonds issued by the state of Israel.
* &quot;Makams&quot; (T-Bills): Short-term bonds (up to one year) issued at a discount by the Bank of Israel. 
* Convertible bonds: a bond that is convertible into a share in consideration for a pre-determined payment (similar to an option) 
* Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs): a security that tracks the price of a product or a particular financial index in Israel or elsewhere in the world. There are ETNs that are calculated according to a formula that is associated with one or more indices. Thus, for example, there are short ETNs that move inversely in relation to a particular index (the note&#x27;s value rises as the index falls, and vice versa).
* Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs): A financial instrument intended to passively track equity and commodity indices. The fund invests its money through linkage to a particular, pre-determined, index, without any discretion being exercised by the fund&#x27;s management.

The fund does not guarantee a return linked to the movement in the index and the return for the investor can be higher or lower than the movement in the selected index, due to the fund&#x27;s trading activity and the deviation (generally, small) in the composition of the fund&#x27;s assets. Actually, an ETF is obligated to make its best effort to track the index and, as such, the ETF should generate a similar, if not an identical, return to the movement in the index that it tracks.

An ETF is a hybrid product, since it is listed on TASE like any other security listed on TASE and can be bought or sold on TASE. However, in addition to this, the investor has the possibility of buying or selling the ETF, in a similar fashion to open-end mutual funds (funds that are not listed on TASE). Like mutual funds, the ETF is subject to the Joint Investment Trusts Law.

* Mutual funds: A fund managed by an investment house that invests its money according to the decisions of the fund&#x27;s management and according to a pre-published prospectus.
* Option warrants: A warrant entitling its holder to convert it into a share or a bond in consideration for a pre-determined payment. These are traded through the TACT system, in contrast to stock exchange derivatives, which are traded through the TACT-Derivatives system.
* The MAOF (a Hebrew acronym for &quot;future and financial instruments&quot;) market – derivatives – options and future contracts on an index, individual securities (a bond or an equity) or exchange rates. TASE&#x27;s MAOF Clearing House is a counterparty for every option, serving as a central clearing house; this is in contrast to option warrants which are a contract with a specific company. Every trader can write and purchase such securities. Options on the TA-35 Index are the product that is the most traded on TASE, with strong activity also taking place in shekel-dollar options. Derivatives are traded in the MAOF arena and have different trading byelaws from those for other assets traded through the regular TACT system (for example, on the MAOF system, prices are quoted in shekels, while on TACT they are quoted in agorot).
* TASE UP: a platform designed for private companies with the aim of allowing them to raise funds from institutional and accredited investors. The TASE UP platform is separate from the TASE trading platform for public companies and companies listed thereon remain private – not making an IPO, not having to report in accordance with the Securities Law and not being subject to the obligation of having to publish a prospectus when listing its securities.
* TASE Data Hub: The TASE Data Hub allows access to TASE&#x27;s data systems. The system was launched, in 2020 and allows access to a broad range of data products relating to the Israeli capital market, using an API (Application Programming Interface) or through daily reports sent to the recipient&#x27;s personal or organizational email. TASE&#x27;s API provides access to TASE&#x27;s databases and is customized to the end-customer&#x27;s personal or organizational needs.

=== Fees ===
TASE collects fees from its members on every transaction executed thereon, calculated in thousands of a percent of the asset value in the case of the TACT system and in tens of agorot per MAOF option unit.

Citizens interested in trading on TASE do so through the TASE members (the abovementioned banks and investment houses), which collect a considerably higher fee for their services from low-volume traders. The banks collect, using their default pricelist (0.6–0.8%), a fee that is 100–200 times higher than the TASE fee charged to them. It is usually possible to obtain a discount of tens of percent from the banking pricelist, just by asking, even if volumes are not significant (reducing the fee to 0.2–0.3%). The fee collected from low-volume traders by non-bank members (i.e., the investment houses) is lower (approximately 0.1%), only some 20 times higher than the TASE fee.

Significant-volume private and institutional traders receive a considerable discount from both the banks and the investment houses, so that the fees collected from the larger traders are at tariffs approaching the TASE pricelist.

Furthermore, the Israeli banks collect a range of different fees in relation to transactions with TASE, such as distribution fees for mutual funds and &quot;custodianship fees&quot;, which is an archaic fee that very few of the investment houses continue to collect; it amounts to 0.1–0.2% annually and originates from the time when securities were actual paper documents that were kept in a safe for the bank&#x27;s customers. In the digital world, the justification for this fee is less clear and most of TASE&#x27;s non-bank members do not collect this fee from their customers; the banks too are tending to waive this fee for some of their customers. TASE publishes a fees comparison table on its website, which allows the different trading fees to be swiftly compared.

=== The companies listed on TASE ===
During the 1960s, the scope of activity on TASE was limited and, in 1965, only 80 companies were listed on TASE. At the end of January 2021, 457 companies were listed on TASE with a total market cap of NIS 837 billion.
== The TASE indices ==
Since the Israeli stock exchange indices reform at the beginning of 2017, there have been two equity universes. The Rimon universe is the senior of the two and comprises some 230 shares that are suitable to be used as underlying assets for derivatives. Such shares have a higher value and more stringent threshold criteria in relation to the free float. The Tamar universe comprises some 350 shares, including smaller value shares as well as shares with a lower free float.

In addition to these, there are other market cap and sectoral indices, as well as government bond indices.

== Regulation ==
TASE&#x27;s operations are governed by the Securities Law, 1968 and the Israel Securities Authority supervises its activity as well as enforcing the laws applicable to public companies. In order to be listed on TASE, a company is required to meet certain criteria, both at the time of making its offering and during the listing period; these criteria are grounded on the TASE Code and on temporary regulations. The TASE Code is intended to prescribe the rules for the equitable and proper conduct of TASE and is a document that is frequently updated in correlation with changes in the Israeli capital market.

=== Dual listing ===
Reliefs were made to the law in 2000 pursuant to which some of the regulations imposed by the Securities Law on dual-listed companies were removed. Companies that are listed on another recognized stock exchange (a closed list of stock exchanges in advanced nations (the NASDAQ, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the NYSE MKT (formerly, AMEX), and the London Stock Exchange&#x27;s (LSE) Main Market and High Growth Segment) can easily and simply dual-list on TASE using the overseas reporting and regulatory format, with limited Israeli regulatory requirements. In addition, listing reliefs have been implemented for companies listed in Israel wishing to list on recognized overseas exchanges and changes have been made to the reporting regime accordingly.

In light of the ever-increasing interest from Israeli companies to also list on markets in the Far East, including Singapore and Hong Kong, due either to business links with these markets or to perceiving the attractiveness of these markets for fundraising, the Israel Securities Authority submitted a proposal that was approved by the Knesset Finance Committee in June 2018, pursuant to which the dual-listing arrangements were extended so as to include three additional stock exchanges: Singapore, Hong Kong and Toronto.

<text>Laurence Rochon &quot;Laurie&quot; Owen (; May 9, 1944 – February 15, 1961) was an American figure skater. She was the 1961 U.S. National Champion and represented the United States at the 1960 Winter Olympics, where she placed 6th. She was the daughter of Maribel Vinson and Guy Owen and the sister of Maribel Owen. Owen died, along with her mother, sister and the entire United States Figure Skating team, in the crash of Sabena Flight 548 en route to the 1961 World Figure Skating Championships. In 2011, on the 50th anniversary of the crash, Owen and the entire team was inducted into the United States Figure Skating Hall of Fame.

==Life and career==
Owen was born in Oakland, California, and for the first eight years grew up in Berkeley. She was the second child of Guy Owen and Maribel Vinson, both talented figure skaters, and the younger sister of pairs skater Maribel Owen. In 1952, shortly after the death of her husband, Maribel Vinson moved her family back to her girlhood home at 195 High Street in Winchester, Massachusetts, where they lived with Maribel&#x27;s mother. Laurence, who at school was known by her full name, attended Winchester Junior High School and then Winchester High School where in addition to maintaining her grueling training schedule she was an honor student, wrote poetry, and participated in several sports.

In 1956, Owen won the Eastern Junior Ladies title but was unable to participate in the United States Championships that year because of a broken wrist. In 1958, she placed 3rd in the United States Figure Skating Championship Junior Ladies Division and, in 1959, won the United States Figure Skating Championship Junior Ladies Division.
In January 1960, Owen placed 3rd in the 1960 United States Figure Skating Championships and qualified for the 1960 Winter Olympics where she placed 6th. Her mother, the 1932 Winter Olympics Bronze Medalist and nine times US Singles Champion Maribel Vinson-Owen, was her coach. 
On January 29, 1961, Owen won the 1961 United States Figure Skating Championships in Colorado Springs and on February 12 that same year, won the 1961 North American Figure Skating Championships in Philadelphia. After her victory at the US Nationals, she became a media sensation and was nicknamed &quot;The Winchester Pixie.&quot; On February 13, 1961, she appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine with a feature story that described her as &quot;America&#x27;s most exciting girl skater.&quot; In that same &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; issue, writer Barbara Hellman noted that Owen had both great presence and a dancer&#x27;s ability to relate to her music and described her free skating as having &quot;an air, a style, an individuality which sets it apart from all the work done in free skating in recent years.&quot;

On January 28, 2011, Owen was inducted into the United States Figure Skating Hall of Fame along with the entire 1961 World Team. Her sister Maribel Owen also was inducted and her mother Maribel Vinson-Owen was inducted for a third time in 2011, in her capacity as a 1961 World Team Coach. Previously, her mother had been inducted in the inaugural Class of 1976 as a singles skater and for a second time in 1994 as a pairs skater.

On February 17, 2011, the U.S. Figure Skating Association released the documentary film entitled &quot;Rise&quot;. The movie chronicled the relationship between Owen and her mother, the airliner crash in Belgium and the rebirth of the United States Figure Skating Team after the crash.

==Death==

As national champion, Owen was selected as a member of the U.S. Figure Skating Team to compete in the 1961 World Figure Skating Championships, to be held in Prague, Czechoslovakia. The championships were scheduled to begin on February 22, 1961. Just before 7:30 pm EST, on Valentine&#x27;s Day 1961, Owen, her mother Maribel Vinson-Owen, her sister Maribel and the rest of the US team, along with 16 of the team&#x27;s friends, family and coaches, boarded Sabena Flight 548 at Idlewild Airport in New York. On February 15, 1961, about 10:00 am Brussels time, the Boeing 707 approached Zaventem Airport. The aircraft was on a long approach to runway 20 when, near the runway threshold and at a height of 900 feet, power was increased and the landing gear retracted. The airplane attempted to circle and land on another runway but never made it back to the airport. The plane made three 360-degree turns to the left, during which the bank angle increased more and more until the aircraft had climbed to 1500 feet and was in a near vertical attitude. The 707 then leveled wings, abruptly pitched up, lost speed, and started to spiral rapidly, nose down, towards the ground. It crashed and caught fire in a marshy area adjacent to a farm field less than two miles from the airport () at 10:04 a.m. Brussels time. All 72 people on board, as well as a farmer on the ground, were killed. Rescue workers discovered a signed copy of the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine, featuring Owen with her signature pixie cut and a bright red skating dress on the cover, amid the wreckage. Laurence Owen was only 16 years old.

The World Championships that year were cancelled out of respect for the United States team.

A memorial service was held on February 26, and Owen was interred that day beside her mother and sister in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Epilogue==

In her book on figure skating, Debbi Wilkes, a Canadian Hall of Fame skater and coach who watched Owen win her title, wrote:
:&quot;Laurence was wonderful. She had a fresh, wholesome look, but didn&#x27;t fit into any mold. She was carefree and joyous on the ice. She had wonderful rosy cheeks, beautiful big eyes and a short shag haircut that feathered over her face and fluttered when she skated. I was totally enchanted by her.&quot;

Owen had planned to attend her mother&#x27;s alma mater, Radcliffe College, with a view to eventually becoming a writer. Following her death, at her high school in Winchester, Massachusetts, Laurie Owen&#x27;s English teacher read a poem to her classmates that Laurie had recently written. The poem ended with these words:

:&quot;Gloom is but a shadow of the night, long past;&quot;
:&quot;Hope is the light, &quot;
:&quot;The radiance.&quot;

<doc id="465920" wikidata="Q292015" url="?curid=465920" title="Listeria monocytogenes">
<text>Listeria monocytogenes is the species of pathogenic bacteria that causes the infection listeriosis. It is a facultative anaerobic bacterium, capable of surviving in the presence or absence of oxygen. It can grow and reproduce inside the host&#x27;s cells and is one of the most virulent foodborne pathogens. Twenty to thirty percent of foodborne listeriosis infections in high-risk individuals may be fatal. In the European Union, listeriosis continues an upward trend that began in 2008, causing 2,161 confirmed cases and 210 reported deaths in 2014, 16% more than in 2013. In the EU, listeriosis mortality rates also are higher than those of other foodborne pathogens. Responsible for an estimated 1,600 illnesses and 260 deaths in the United States annually, listeriosis ranks third in total number of deaths among foodborne bacterial pathogens, with fatality rates exceeding even &quot;Salmonella&quot; spp. and &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot;.

Named for Joseph Lister, &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; is a Gram-positive bacterium, in the phylum Bacillota. Its ability to grow at temperatures as low as 0 °C permits multiplication at typical refrigeration temperatures, greatly increasing its ability to evade control in human foodstuffs. Motile via flagella at 30 °C and below, but usually not at 37 °C, &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; can instead move within eukaryotic cells by explosive polymerization of actin filaments (known as comet tails or actin rockets). Once &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; enters the host cytoplasm, multiple changes in bacterial metabolism and gene expression help to complete its metamorphosis from soil dweller to intracellular pathogen.

Studies suggest that up to 10% of human gastrointestinal tracts may be colonized by &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot;. Nevertheless, clinical diseases due to &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; are more frequently recognized by veterinarians, especially as meningoencephalitis in ruminants. See: listeriosis in animals.

Due to its frequent pathogenicity, causing meningitis in newborns (acquired transvaginally), pregnant women are often advised not to eat soft cheeses such as Brie, Camembert, feta, and queso blanco fresco, which may be contaminated with and permit growth of &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot;. It is the third most common cause of meningitis in newborns. &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; can infect the brain, spinal-cord membranes and bloodstream of the host through the ingestion of contaminated food such as unpasteurized dairy or raw foods.

== Classification ==
&quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, motile, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium. It is catalase-positive and oxidase-negative, and expresses a beta hemolysin, which causes destruction of red blood cells. This bacterium exhibits characteristic tumbling motility when viewed with light microscopy. Although &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; is actively motile by means of peritrichous flagella at room temperature (20−25 °C), the organism does not synthesize flagella at body temperatures (37 °C).

The genus &quot;Listeria&quot; belongs to the class Bacilli and the order Bacillales, which also includes &quot;Bacillus&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;. &quot;Listeria&quot; currently contains 27 species: &quot;Listeria aquatica, Listeria booriae, Listeria cornellensis, Listeria cossartiae, Listeria costaricensis, Listeria farberi, Listeria fleischmannii, Listeria floridensis, Listeria goaensis, Listeria grandensis, Listeria grayi, Listeria immobilis, Listeria innocua, Listeria ivanovii, Listeria marthii, Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria murrayi, Listeria newyorkensis, Listeria portnoyi, Listeria riparia, Listeria rocourtiae, Listeria rustica, Listeria seeligeri, Listeria thailandensis, Listeria valentina, Listeria weihenstephanensis, Listeria welshimeri&quot;. &quot;L. denitrificans&quot;, previously thought to be part of the genus &quot;Listeria&quot;, was reclassified into the new genus &quot;Jonesia&quot;. Both &quot;L. ivanovii&quot; and &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; are pathogenic in mice, but only &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; is consistently associated with human illness. The 13 serotypes of &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; can cause disease, but more than 90% of human isolates belong to only three serotypes: 1/2a, 1/2b, and 4b. &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; serotype 4b strains are responsible for 33 to 35% of sporadic human cases worldwide and for all major foodborne outbreaks in Europe and North America since the 1980s.

== History ==
&quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; was first described by E.G.D. Murray (Everitt George Dunne Murray) in 1924 based on six cases of sudden death in young rabbits, and published a description with his colleagues in 1926 .
Murray referred to the organism as &quot;Bacterium monocytogenes&quot; before Harvey Pirie changed the genus name to &quot;Listeria&quot; in 1940. Although clinical descriptions of &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; infection in both animals and humans were published in the 1920s, it was not recognized as a significant cause of neonatal infection, sepsis, and meningitis until 1952 in East Germany. Listeriosis in adults was later associated with patients living with compromised immune systems, such as individuals taking immunosuppressant drugs and corticosteroids for malignancies or organ transplants, and those with HIV infection.

&quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; was not identified as a cause of foodborne illness until 1981, however. An outbreak of listeriosis in Halifax, Nova Scotia, involving 41 cases and 18 deaths, mostly in pregnant women and neonates, was epidemiologically linked to the consumption of coleslaw containing cabbage that had been contaminated with &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot;-contaminated sheep manure. Since then, a number of cases of foodborne listeriosis have been reported, and &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; is now widely recognized as an important hazard in the food industry.

==Pathogenesis==
Invasive infection by &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; causes the disease listeriosis. When the infection is not invasive, any illness as a consequence of infection is termed febrile gastroenteritis. The manifestations of listeriosis include sepsis, meningitis (or meningoencephalitis), encephalitis, corneal ulcer, pneumonia, myocarditis, and intrauterine or cervical infections in pregnant women, which may result in spontaneous abortion (second to third trimester) or stillbirth. Surviving neonates of fetomaternal listeriosis may suffer granulomatosis infantiseptica — pyogenic granulomas distributed over the whole body — and may suffer from physical retardation. Influenza-like symptoms, including persistent fever, usually precede the onset of the aforementioned disorders. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, may precede more serious forms of listeriosis or may be the only symptoms expressed. Gastrointestinal symptoms were epidemiologically associated with use of antacids or cimetidine. The onset time to serious forms of listeriosis is unknown, but may range from a few days to 3 weeks. The onset time to gastrointestinal symptoms is unknown, but probably exceeds 12 hours. An early study suggested that &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; is unique among Gram-positive bacteria in that it might possess lipopolysaccharide, which serves as an endotoxin. Later, it was found to not be a true endotoxin. &quot;Listeria&quot; cell walls consistently contain lipoteichoic acids, in which a glycolipid moiety, such as a galactosyl-glucosyl-diglyceride, is covalently linked to the terminal phosphomonoester of the teichoic acid. This lipid region anchors the polymer chain to the cytoplasmic membrane. These lipoteichoic acids resemble the lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative bacteria in both structure and function, being the only amphipathic polymers at the cell surface.

&quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; has D-galactose residues on its surface that can attach to D-galactose receptors on the host cell walls. These host cells are generally M cells and Peyer&#x27;s patches of the intestinal mucosa. Once attached to these cells, &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; can translocate past the intestinal membrane and into the body.. Alternatively, losses of structural integrity (such as small lacerations) in the gastrointestinal epithelium could allow the microorganism to penetrate from the gastrointestinal tract to the bloodstream.

The infectious dose of &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; varies with the strain and with the susceptibility of the victim. From cases contracted through raw or supposedly pasteurized milk, one may safely assume that, in susceptible persons, fewer than 1,000 total organisms may cause disease. &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; may invade the gastrointestinal epithelium. Once the bacterium enters the host&#x27;s monocytes, macrophages, or polymorphonuclear leukocytes, it becomes bloodborne (sepsis) and can grow. Its presence intracellularly in phagocytic cells also permits access to the brain and probably transplacental migration to the fetus in pregnant women. This process is known as the &quot;Trojan Horse mechanism&quot;. The pathogenesis of &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; centers on its ability to survive and multiply in phagocytic host cells. It seems that &quot;Listeria&quot; originally evolved to invade membranes of the intestines, as an intracellular infection, and developed a chemical mechanism to do so. This involves a bacterial protein internalin (InlA/InlB), which attaches to a protein on the intestinal cell membrane &quot;cadherin&quot; and allows the bacteria to invade the cells through a zipper mechanism. These adhesion molecules are also to be found in two other unusually tough barriers in humans — the blood-brain barrier and the fetal–placental barrier, and this may explain the apparent affinity that &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; has for causing meningitis and affecting babies &quot;in utero&quot;. Once inside the cell, &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; rapidly acidifies the lumen of the vacuole formed around it during cell entry to activate listeriolysin O, a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin capable of disrupting the vacuolar membrane. This frees the pathogen and gives it access to the cytosol of the cell, where it continues its pathogenesis. Motility in the intracellular space is provided by actin assembly-inducing protein, which allows the bacteria to use the host cell&#x27;s actin polymerization machinery to polymerize the cytoskeleton to give a &quot;boost&quot; to the bacterial cell so it can move in the cell. The same mechanism also allows the bacteria to travel from cell to cell.

===Regulation of pathogenesis===
&quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; can act as a saprophyte or a pathogen, depending on its environment. When this bacterium is present within a host organism, quorum sensing and other signals cause the up-regulation of several virulence genes. Depending on the location of the bacterium within the host organism, different activators up-regulate the virulence genes. SigB, an alternative sigma factor, up-regulates &quot;Vir&quot; genes in the intestines, whereas PrfA up-regulates gene expression when the bacterium is present in blood. &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; also senses the entry to host by examining available nutrient sources. For example L-glutamine, an abundant nitrogen source in the host, induces the expression of virulence genes in &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot;. Little is known about how this bacterium switches between acting as a saprophyte and a pathogen; however, several noncoding RNAs are thought to be required to induce this change.

===Pathogenicity of lineages===
&quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; has three distinct lineages, with differing evolutionary histories and pathogenic potentials. Lineage I strains contain the majority of human clinical isolates and all human epidemic clones, but are underrepresented in animal clinical isolates. Lineage II strains are overrepresented in animal cases and underrepresented in human clinical cases, and are more prevalent in environmental and food samples. Lineage III isolates are very rare, but significantly more common in animal than human isolates.

==Detection==

The Anton test is used in the identification of &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot;; instillation of a culture into the conjunctival sac of a rabbit or guinea pig causes severe keratoconjunctivitis within 24 hours.

&quot;Listeria &quot;species grow on media such as Mueller-Hinton agar. Identification is enhanced if the primary cultures are done on agar containing sheep blood, because the characteristic small zone of hemolysis can be observed around and under colonies. Isolation can be enhanced if the tissue is kept at 4 °C for some days before inoculation into bacteriologic media. The organism is a facultative anaerobe and is catalase-positive and motile. &quot;Listeria&quot; produces acid, but not gas, when fermenting a variety of carbohydrates.
The motility at room temperature and hemolysin production are primary findings that help differentiate Listeria from Corynebacterium.

The methods for analysis of food are complex and time-consuming. The present U.S. FDA method, revised in September 1990, requires 24 and 48 hours of enrichment, followed by a variety of other tests. Total time to identification takes five to seven days, but the announcement of specific non-radiolabelled DNA probes should soon allow a simpler and faster confirmation of suspect isolates.

Recombinant DNA technology may even permit two- to three-day positive analysis in the future. Currently, the FDA is collaborating in adapting its methodology to quantitate very low numbers of the organisms in foods.

== Treatment ==
When listeric meningitis occurs, the overall mortality may reach 70%, from sepsis 50%, and from perinatal/neonatal infections greater than 80%. In infections during pregnancy, the mother usually survives. Reports of successful treatment with parenteral penicillin or ampicillin exist. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been shown effective in patients allergic to penicillin.

A bacteriophage, &quot;Listeria phage P100&quot;, has been proposed as food additive to control &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot;. Bacteriophage treatments have been developed by several companies. EBI Food Safety and Intralytix both have products suitable for treatment of the bacterium. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a cocktail of six bacteriophages from Intralytix, and a one-type phage product from EBI Food Safety designed to kill &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot;. Uses would potentially include spraying it on fruits and ready-to-eat meat such as sliced ham and turkey.

== Use as a transfection vector ==
Because &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; is an intracellular bacterium, some studies have used this bacterium as a vector to deliver genes &quot;in vitro&quot;. Current transfection efficiency remains poor. One example of the successful use of &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; in &quot;in vitro&quot; transfer technologies is in the delivery of gene therapies for cystic fibrosis cases.

=== Cancer treatment ===
&quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; is being investigated as a cancer immunotherapy for several types of cancer.

A live attenuated &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; cancer vaccine, ADXS11-001, is under development as a possible treatment for cervical carcinoma.

==Epidemiology==
Researchers have found &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; in at least 37 mammalian species, both domesticated and feral, as well as in at least 17 species of birds and possibly in some species of fish and shellfish. Laboratories can isolate &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; from soil, silage, and other environmental sources. &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; is quite hardy and resists the deleterious effects of freezing, drying, and heat remarkably well for a bacterium that does not form spores. Most &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; strains are pathogenic to some degree.

==Routes of infection==
&quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; has been associated with such foods as raw milk, pasteurized fluid milk, cheeses (particularly soft-ripened varieties), hard-boiled eggs, ice cream, raw vegetables, fermented raw-meat sausages, raw and cooked poultry, raw meats (of all types), and raw and smoked fish. Most bacteria can survive near freezing temperatures, but cannot absorb nutrients, grow or replicate; however, &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; has the ability to grow at temperatures as low as 0 °C which permits exponential multiplication in refrigerated foods. At refrigeration temperature, such as 4 °C, the amount of ferric iron can affect the growth of &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot;.

==Infectious cycle==

The primary site of infection is the intestinal epithelium, where the bacteria invade nonphagocytic cells via the &quot;zipper&quot; mechanism. Uptake is stimulated by the binding of listerial internalins (Inl) to E-cadherin, a host cell adhesion factor, or Met (c-Met), hepatocyte growth factor. This binding activates certain Rho-GTPases, which subsequently bind and stabilize Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp). WASp can then bind the Arp2/3 complex and serve as an actin nucleation point. Subsequent actin polymerization creates a &quot;phagocytic cup&quot;, an actin-based structure normally formed around foreign materials by phagocytes prior to endocytosis. The net effect of internalin binding is to exploit the junction-forming apparatus of the host into internalizing the bacterium. &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; can also invade phagocytic cells (e.g., macrophages), but requires only internalins for invasion of nonphagocytic cells.

Following internalization, the bacterium must escape from the vacuole/phagosome before fusion with a lysosome can occur. Three main virulence factors that allow the bacterium to escape are listeriolysin O (LLO encoded by &quot;hly&quot;) phospholipase A (encoded by &quot;plcA&quot;) and phospholipase B (&quot;plcB&quot;). Secretion of LLO and PlcA disrupts the vacuolar membrane and allows the bacterium to escape into the cytoplasm, where it may proliferate.

Once in the cytoplasm, &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; exploits host actin for the second time. ActA proteins associated with the old bacterial cell pole (being a bacillus, &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; septates in the middle of the cell, thus has one new pole and one old pole) are capable of binding the Arp2/3 complex, thereby inducing actin nucleation at a specific area of the bacterial cell surface. Actin polymerization then propels the bacterium unidirectionally into the host cell membrane. The protrusion formed may then be internalized by a neighboring cell, forming a double-membrane vacuole from which the bacterium must escape using LLO and PlcB. This mode of direct cell-to-cell spread involves a cellular mechanism known as paracytophagy.

The ability of L. monocytogenes to successfully infect depends on its resistance to the high concentrations of bile encountered throughout the gastrointestinal tract. This resistance is due, in part, to the nucleotide excision repair protein UvrA that is necessary for repair of DNA damages caused by bile salts.
