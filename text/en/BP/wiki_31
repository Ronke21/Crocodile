<text>Donald LeRoy LaFontaine (August 26, 1940 – September 1, 2008) was an American voice actor who recorded more than 5,000 film trailers and hundreds of thousands of television advertisements, network promotions, and video game trailers over four decades.

He became identified with the phrase &quot;In a world...&quot;, used in so many movie trailers that it became a humorous catchphrase. Widely known in the film industry, the man whose nicknames included &quot;Thunder Throat&quot;, &quot;The Voice of God&quot; and &quot;The King of Movie Trailers&quot;, became known to a wider audience through commercials for GEICO insurance and the Mega Millions lottery game.

== Early life ==
LaFontaine was born on August 26, 1940, in Duluth, Minnesota, to Alfred and Ruby LaFontaine (née Dravland; b. 1918). LaFontaine said his voice cracked at age 13 in mid-sentence, giving him the bass tones that later brought him much fame and success. After graduating from Duluth Central High School in 1958, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and served as an audio engineer with the U.S. Army Band and the U.S. Army Chorus.

== Career ==
LaFontaine continued to work as a recording engineer after discharge and began working at the National Recording Studios in New York City, where, in 1962, he had the opportunity to work with producer Floyd Peterson on radio spots for &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;. Peterson incorporated many of LaFontaine&#x27;s ideas for the spots and, in 1963, they went into business together producing advertising exclusively for the movie industry. LaFontaine claimed that this company first came up with many of the famous movie trailer catchphrases, including his own future signature phrase &quot;In a world...&quot;.

While working on the 1964 western &quot;Gunfighters of Casa Grande&quot;, LaFontaine had to fill in for an unavailable voice actor to have something to present to MGM. After MGM bought the spots, LaFontaine began a career as a voiceover artist.

He became the head of Kaleidoscope Films Ltd., a movie trailer production company, before starting his own company, Don LaFontaine Associates, in 1976. Shortly thereafter, he was hired by Paramount to do their trailers and was eventually promoted to vice president. He decided to get back into trailer work and left Paramount, moving to Los Angeles in 1981. LaFontaine was contacted by an agent who wanted to promote him for voiceover work, and from then on worked in voiceovers. At his peak, he voiced about 60 promotions a week, and sometimes as many as 35 in a single day. Once he established himself, most studios were willing to pay a high fee for his service. His income was in the millions.

LaFontaine often had jobs at several different studios each day. With the advent of ISDN technology, LaFontaine eventually built a recording studio in his Hollywood Hills home and began doing his work from home.

LaFontaine lent his distinctive voice to thousands of movie trailers during his career, spanning every genre from every major film studio, including The Cannon Group, for which he voiced one of their logos (he also voiced the Viacom closing logo in 1990, simply saying the company&#x27;s name after it had been formed on the screen). For a time, LaFontaine had a near-monopoly on movie trailer voiceovers. Some notable trailers which LaFontaine highlighted in the intro on his official website include: &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, &quot;Shrek&quot;, &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and &quot;Batman Returns&quot;. LaFontaine stated in 2007 that his favorite work in a movie trailer was for the biographical film &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, though according to a response to the question on his website, he had several trailers which stood out in his mind, and he didn&#x27;t like to choose one.

Lafontaine also did announcing for a few WWE Pay Per View events, as well as the &quot;Don&#x27;t Try This at Home&quot; bumper and the opening narration for the television shows &quot;Team Knight Rider&quot;, &quot;Renegade&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

In a 2007 interview, LaFontaine explained the strategy behind his signature catchphrase &quot;In a world where...&quot;:

We have to very rapidly establish the world we are transporting them to. That&#x27;s very easily done by saying, &quot;In a world where...&quot; You very rapidly set the scene.

LaFontaine also did other voice work, including as the announcer for the newscasts on WCBS-TV New York, from 2000 to 2001, narrator of &quot;The Making of Star Wars&quot; documentary from 1977 and the television shows &quot;The Third Eye&quot;, &quot;World&#x27;s Most Amazing Videos&quot;, &quot;Boot Camp&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, &quot;Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction&quot; and &quot;Fillmore!&quot;. LaFontaine was a recurring guest narrator for clues on the game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and appeared on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; on May 14, 2005, where he played &quot;Not My Job&quot; (a game in which famous people must accurately answer questions unrelated to their chosen professions). The prize (for a listener, not the contestant) is &quot;Carl Kasell&#x27;s voice on your home answering machine&quot;. LaFontaine did not win the game and offered to record the listener&#x27;s answering machine message himself. LaFontaine once claimed that he enjoyed recording messages like these because it allowed him to be creative in writing unique messages and said that he would do so for anyone who contacted him if he had the time. By 2007, he found the requests to be too numerous for him to take on and stopped providing the service.

In 2006, GEICO began an advertising campaign in which actual customers told their own stories of GEICO experiences, accompanied by a celebrity who helped them make the story interesting. LaFontaine was featured as the celebrity in one of these ads which began airing in August 2006. In the commercial, he was introduced by the voice-over as &quot;that announcer guy from the movies&quot;, with his name printed on-screen to identify him. He began his telling of the customer&#x27;s story with his trademark &quot;In a world...&quot;. LaFontaine credited the spot as life-changing for having exposed his name and face to a significant audience, noting, &quot;There goes any anonymity I might have had...&quot;.

== Health and death ==
On Friday, August 22, 2008, LaFontaine, a longtime smoker, was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, with a pulmonary embolism and was reported to be in critical condition the following Tuesday. His family made a public appeal for prayers on Mediabistro. On September 1, 2008, six days after his 68th birthday and ten days after his hospitalization, LaFontaine died following complications from a pneumothorax. He is buried at Hollywood Forever Cemetery. His final television voice over role was for the &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; episode &quot;The Chronicles of Meap&quot; in which he said in his final line: &quot;In a world... There, I said it. Happy?&quot; The episode also ended with a short tribute to him, although the iTunes, UK, Spanish, and Disney+ versions of the episode omitted the dedication. His final movie trailer voice-over was for &quot;Call + Response&quot;, a documentary about the global slave trade, for which he donated his talent.

== Legacy ==
On September 6, 2008, &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; showed a visual with a picture of him with words below that said, &quot;In Memoriam: Don LaFontaine August 26, 1940 – September 1, 2008.&quot; John Walsh had announced, prior to the dedication sign, that LaFontaine—who had been the show&#x27;s announcer since 1988—had died at the age of 68. On the evening of September 7, 2008, &quot;Adult Swim&quot; had a bumper that said: Don LaFontaine [1940-2008].

The show &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; from Disney also dedicated the episode &quot;The Chronicles of Meap&quot; which he provided the narration for. Fellow voice-over artist and friend John Leader retired from the voice-over business on September 1, 2008, upon learning of LaFontaine&#x27;s death.

LaFontaine was referenced, with opening clips of his work and several subsequent verbal homages, in the film &quot;In a World...&quot;, written and directed by Lake Bell.

After his death, voice-overs in film trailers became rare, with most trailers now relying on music, sound effects, and dialogue taken from the film.

<doc id="472278" wikidata="Q846376" url="?curid=472278" title="Soufflé">
<text>A soufflé () is a baked egg dish originating in France in the early 18th century. Combined with various other ingredients, it can be served as a savoury main dish or sweetened as a dessert. The word &quot;soufflé&quot; is the past participle of the French verb , which means to blow, breathe, inflate or puff.

==History==
The earliest mention of soufflé is attributed to the French master cook, Vincent La Chapelle, in the early eighteenth century. The development and popularisation of the soufflé is usually traced to the French chef Marie-Antoine Carême in the early nineteenth century.

==Ingredients and preparation==
Soufflés are typically prepared from two basic components:

# a flavored crème pâtissière, cream sauce or béchamel, or a purée as the base
# egg whites beaten to a soft peak

The base provides the flavor, and the egg whites provide the &quot;lift&quot; or puffiness to the dish. Foods commonly used to flavor the base include herbs, cheese and vegetables for savory soufflés; and jam, fruits, berries, chocolate, banana and lemon for dessert soufflés.

Soufflés are generally baked in ramekins or soufflé dishes: these are typically glazed, flat-bottomed, round porcelain containers with unglazed bottoms, vertical or nearly vertical sides and fluted exterior borders. The ramekin, or another baking vessel, may be coated with a thin film of butter to prevent the soufflé from sticking. Some preparations also include adding a coating of sugar, bread crumbs, or a grated hard cheese such as parmesan inside the ramekin in addition to the butter; some cooks believe this allows the soufflé to rise more easily.

After being cooked, a soufflé is puffed up and fluffy, and it will generally fall after 5 or 10 minutes (as risen dough does). It may be served with a sauce atop the soufflé, such as a sweet dessert sauce, or with a sorbet or ice cream on the side. When served, the top of a soufflé may be punctured with serving utensils to separate it into individual servings. This can also enable a sauce to integrate into the dish.

==Variations==
There are a number of both savory and sweet soufflé flavor variations. Savory soufflés often include cheese, and vegetables such as spinach, carrot and herbs, and may sometimes incorporate poultry, bacon, ham, or seafood for a more substantial dish. Sweet soufflés may be based on a chocolate or fruit sauce (lemon or raspberry, for example) and are often served with a dusting of powdered sugar. Frugal recipes sometimes emphasize the possibilities for making soufflés from leftovers.

A soufflé may be served alone, with ice cream, fruit, or a sauce.

Apple soufflé is made by lining a cake tin with pureed rice boiled in sweetened milk and baking it until it sets. The rice &quot;border&quot; is filled with thickened apple marmalade and whipped egg whites and baked until it rises.

<text>USS &quot;Flier&quot; (SS-250) was a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine. It was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the flier.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Flier&quot;′s keel was laid down 30 October 1942 by Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 11 July 1943, sponsored by Mrs. A. S. Pierce, and commissioned on 18 October 1943.

==October 1943–May 1944==

After shakedown training, &quot;Flier&quot; departed New London, Connecticut, in early December 1943 bound for the Panama Canal. While she was on the surface in the Caribbean Sea nearing the approaches to the canal, an Alied merchant ship mistook her for a German U-boat and opened gunfire on her, firing 13 rounds, but she escaped into a rain squall without suffering damage or casualties. After transiting the Panama Canal, she reached Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 20 December 1943 and prepared for her first war patrol.

&quot;Flier&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for her first war patrol on 12 January 1944 but ran aground near Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands on 16 January 1944. , a submarine rescue ship, attempted to pull &quot;Flier&quot; free but ran aground herself and sank. &quot;Flier&quot; eventually was saved by the submarine rescue ship and towed to first Pearl Harbor and then the Mare Island Navy Yard at Mare Island, California, for repairs.

==First war patrol==
On 21 May 1944, &quot;Flier&quot; again departed for her first war patrol, heading for a patrol area in the South China Sea west of Luzon in the Philippines. She made her first contact on 4 June 1944, attacking a well-escorted Japanese convoy of five merchant ships. Firing three torpedoes at each of two ships, she sent the 10,380-gross register ton transport &quot;Hakusan Maru&quot; to the bottom and scored a hit on another ship before clearing the area to evade counterattack.

On 13 June 1944, &quot;Flier&quot; attacked a Japanese convoy of 11 ships — cargo ships and tankers — guarded by at least six escorts. The alert behavior of the escorts during the attack resulted in a severe counterattack on &quot;Flier&quot; before she could observe what damage she had done to the convoy. On 22 June 1944, she began a long chase after another large convoy, scoring four hits for six torpedoes fired at two cargo ships that day, and three hits for four torpedoes launched against another cargo ship of the same convoy the next day. &quot;Flier&quot; put into Fremantle submarine base at Fremantle, Western Australia, on 5 July 1944 and began a refit.

==Second war patrol==
With her refit complete, &quot;Flier&quot; departed Fremantle on 2 August 1944 on her second war patrol, bound for a patrol area in the South China Sea off the coast of Japanese-occupied French Indochina via the Lombok Strait, Macassar Strait, and Balabac Strait. At about 22:00 on 12 August, while transiting the Balabac Strait on the surface, she struck a naval mine. She sank in about a minute, but 15 officers and men were able to clamber out. Eight of them reached the beach of Byan Island after 17 hours in the water. Philippine guerrillas guided them to a coastwatcher, who arranged for them to be picked up by submarine, and on the night of 30–31 August 1944 they were taken aboard the submarine .

==Honors and awards==
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with one battle star for World War II service

&quot;Flier&quot;&#x27;s single completed war patrol was designated &quot;successful.&quot; She is credited with having sunk 10,380 gross register tons of Japanese shipping.

==Wreck==
On 1 February 2009, the U.S. Navy announced the discovery of &quot;Flier&quot; near the Balabac Strait in the Philippines at . The discovery of a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine was made during an expedition by YAP Films, based in part on information provided by a survivor of the sinking of &quot;Flier&quot;. Further research by the Naval History and Heritage Command revealed that no other submarine, American or Japanese, had been reported lost in that general vicinity. In addition, footage of the wreck showed a gun mount and radar antenna, both of which were similar to the same equipment seen in contemporary photographs of &quot;Flier&quot;. The ship rests in of water.

<doc id="472282" wikidata="Q14532172" url="?curid=472282" title="Sykes (TV series)">
<text>Sykes is a British sitcom that aired on BBC1 from 1972 to 1979. Starring Eric Sykes and Hattie Jacques, it was written by Sykes, who had previously starred with Jacques in &quot;Sykes and a...&quot; (1960–1965) and &quot;Sykes and a Big, Big Show&quot; (1971). Forty-three of the 1970s colour episodes were remakes of scripts for the 1960s black and white series, such as &quot;Bus&quot; based on &quot;Sykes and a Following&quot; from 1964 and the episode &quot;Stranger&quot; with Peter Sellers based on &quot;Sykes and a Stranger&quot; from 1961.

&quot;Sykes&quot; had the same premise as &quot;Sykes and a...&quot; with Sykes, Jacques, Richard Wattis and Deryck Guyler reprising their former identical roles. The series was brought to an end by the death of Hattie Jacques of a heart attack on 6 October 1980.

==Cast==
*Eric Sykes – Himself
*Hattie Jacques – Harriet (Hat) Sykes
*Richard Wattis – Charles Fulbright-Brown (series 1–3)
*Deryck Guyler – PC Corky Turnbull
*Joy Harington – Melody Rumbelow
*Joan Sims – Madge Kettlewell

==Plot==
With the same premise as &quot;Sykes and a...&quot;, unmarried twins Eric and Harriet (Hat) Sykes are now living at an end of terrace house, 28 Sebastopol Terrace, East Acton, two doors down from their house in the previous programme. As before, Eric is childish and accident-prone while Hattie is patient. Their neighbour is the snobbish unmarried Charles Fulbright-Brown, and PC Corky Turnbull is the local policeman. Corky&#x27;s wife, Elsie, is unseen, except for two episodes, &quot;Caravan&quot;, in which she appears with her face covered in porridge during a food fight between Corky and Eric, and &quot;Holiday Camp&quot;, when the back of her head is shown going into the Ghost Train ride, and later on asleep and passing wind in bed. Deryck Guyler also played Corky&#x27;s brother Wilfred Turnbull, a train attendant on the Glasgow to London sleeper train, in the episode &quot;Journey&quot;. He also played another relative, bus inspector Norman Burnside in &quot;Bus&quot;.

Following the death of Richard Wattis in 1975, a new neighbour, Melody Rumbelow, moves in. The local baker is the widowed Madge Kettlewell (Joan Sims), who appears occasionally, and who fancies Eric. She is first seen in the episode &quot;Football&quot;. Eric and Hattie are also the owners of a cuckoo clock, naming the very temperamental bird inside Peter. Both speak to it as if it were a real bird, and a great deal of comedy derives from the antagonistic and sarcastic &quot;conversation&quot; between Eric and Peter.

==DVD releases==
The first series of &quot;Sykes&quot; was released on DVD in the UK (Region 2) in 2004. Several episodes in this set were reassembled from the original studio sessions rather than the broadcast masters. This not only yielded better quality, but also allowed scenes that had been cut for timing purposes to be restored, and for outtakes to be included as extras. Conversely, since the colour videotape of the episode &quot;Journey&quot; had been wiped this episode was taken from a black and white copy. A brief featurette explains some of the restoration techniques employed.

A Complete Series DVD set (containing all 68 episodes) was released on 26 June 2017. Series 1 is represented by the remastered episodes and featurettes from the previous set. The rest of the episodes do not exhibit the same level of remastering, although some of them do appear to be extended versions.

<doc id="472288" wikidata="Q265283" url="?curid=472288" title="Pauline epistles">
<text>The Pauline epistles, also known as Epistles of Paul or Letters of Paul, are the thirteen books of the New Testament attributed to Paul the Apostle, although the authorship of some is in dispute. Among these epistles are some of the earliest extant Christian documents. They provide an insight into the beliefs and controversies of early Christianity. As part of the canon of the New Testament, they are foundational texts for both Christian theology and ethics.

Most scholars believe that Paul actually wrote seven of the thirteen Pauline epistles (Galatians, Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Philemon, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians), while three of the epistles in Paul&#x27;s name are widely seen as pseudepigraphic (1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus). Whether Paul wrote the three other epistles in his name (2 Thessalonians, Ephesians and Colossians) is widely debated. The Epistle to the Hebrews, although it does not bear his name, was traditionally considered Pauline (although Rome questioned its authorship), but from the 16th century onwards opinion steadily moved against Pauline authorship and few scholars now ascribe it to Paul, mostly because it does not read like any of his other epistles in style and content and because the epistle does not indicate that Paul is the author, unlike the others.

A number of scholars have argued that from biographic details from Paul, he likely suffered from some physical impediment such as vision loss or damaged hands and Paul does explicitly state, or even names, in multiple epistles that he used secretaries, which was a common practice in the Greco-Roman world; likely explaining the epistles that are seemingly non-Pauline. 

The Pauline epistles are usually placed between the Acts of the Apostles and the catholic epistles (also called the general epistles) in modern editions. Most Greek manuscripts place the general epistles first, and a few minuscules (175, 325, 336, and 1424) place the Pauline epistles at the end of the New Testament.

== Authenticity ==


In all of these epistles, except the Epistle to the Hebrews, the author and writer does claim to be Paul. The contested letters may have been written using Paul&#x27;s name, as it was common to attribute at that point in history.
Seven letters (with consensus dates) considered genuine by most scholars:

* Galatians (c. 48 AD)
* First Thessalonians (c. 49–51)
* First Corinthians (c. 53–54)
* Second Corinthians (c. 55–56)
* Romans (c. 55–57)
* Philippians (c. 57–59 or c. 62)
* Philemon (c. 57–59 or c. 62)

The three letters on which scholars are about evenly divided: If these letters are inauthentic, then the consensus dates are probably incorrect.
* Second Thessalonians (c. 51–52)
* Colossians (c. 57–59 or c. 62)
* Ephesians (c. 62)

The letters thought to be pseudepigraphic by many scholars (traditional dating given): The content of these letters strongly suggests they were written a decade or more later than the traditional dates.
* First Timothy (c. 62–64)
* Second Timothy (c. 62–65)
* Titus (c. 66–67)

Finally, Epistle to the Hebrews, although anonymous and not really in the form of a letter, has long been included among Paul&#x27;s collected letters. Although some churches ascribe Hebrews to Paul, neither most of Christianity nor modern scholarship does so.

== Order ==
In the order they appear in the New Testament, the Pauline epistles are:

This ordering is remarkably consistent in the manuscript tradition, with very few deviations. The evident principle of organization is descending length of the Greek text, but keeping the three pastoral epistles addressed to individuals in a separate final section. The only anomaly is that Galatians precedes the slightly longer Ephesians.

In modern editions, the anonymous Epistle to the Hebrews is placed at the end of Paul&#x27;s letters and before the general epistles. This practice was popularized through the 4th century Vulgate by Jerome, who was aware of ancient doubts about its authorship, and is also followed in most medieval Byzantine manuscripts with hardly any exceptions.

The placement of Hebrews among the Pauline epistles is less consistent in the manuscripts:
* between Romans and 1 Corinthians (i.e., in order by length without splitting the Epistles to the Corinthians): Papyrus 46 and minuscules 103, 455, 1961, 1964, 1977, 1994.
* between 2 Corinthians and Galatians: minuscules 1930, 1978, and 2248
* between Galatians and Ephesians: implied by the numbering in B. In B, Galatians ends and Ephesians begins on the same side of the same folio (page 1493); similarly 2 Thessalonians ends and Hebrews begins on the same side of the same folio (page 1512).
* between 2 Thessalonians and 1 Timothy (i.e., before the Pastorals): א, A, B, C, H, I, P, 0150, 0151, and about 60 minuscules (e.g. 218, 632)
* after Philemon: D, 048, E, K, L and the majority of minuscules.
* omitted: F and G

==Lost Pauline epistles==
Paul&#x27;s own writings are sometimes thought to indicate several of his letters that have not been preserved:
* A first, or &quot;zeroth&quot;, epistle to Corinth, also called &quot;A Prior Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians&quot;, or &quot;Paul&#x27;s previous Corinthian letter&quot;, possibly referenced at 1 Corinthians 5:9.
* A third epistle to Corinth, written in between 1 and 2 Corinthians, also called the Severe Letter, referenced at 2 Corinthians 2:4 and 2 Corinthians 7:8-9
* An earlier epistle to the Ephesians referenced at Ephesians 3:3-4
* A possible Pauline Epistle to the Laodiceans, referenced at Colossians 4:16

== Pseudepigraphic epistles ==

Several other epistles were attributed to Paul during the course of history but are now considered pseudepigraphic:
* Third Epistle to the Corinthians, a correspondence of two letters allegedly sent by the Corinthians to Paul, and then a reply letter allegedly sent by Paul to the Church of Corinth. It was considered genuine for some time by the Syriac Orthodox Church and the Armenian Apostolic Church, but is now widely dated in the second half of the 2nd century CE.
*Epistle to the Alexandrians, an alleged epistle written by Paul to the Church of Alexandria. It is mentioned in the Muratorian fragment (2nd century CE), which denounces it as a spurious work forged by Marcion of Sinope. Its text has been lost and nothing is known about its content.
* Non-Pauline Epistle to the Laodiceans versions:
** The Marcionite Epistle to the Laodiceans. The Muratorian fragment (2nd century CE) denounces a claimed Epistle to the Laodiceans as another spurious work forged by Marcion of Sinope. Its text has been lost and nothing is known about its content.
** The Latin Epistle to the Laodiceans. It is found in some old Latin Bible manuscripts, but is widely considered a forgery, and is largely a copy of verses from the Epistle to the Philippians. Theories vary, but it was possibly made as a counterforgery to offset the popularity of the Marcionite epistle.
* Correspondence of Paul and Seneca, a collection of correspondence claiming to be between Paul and Seneca the Younger. They are universally considered a forgery from the 4th century CE.

==Collected epistles==
David Trobisch finds it likely that Paul first collected his letters for publication himself. It was normal practice in Paul&#x27;s time for letter writers to keep one copy for themselves and send a second copy to the recipient(s); surviving collections of ancient letters sometimes originated from the senders&#x27; copies, at other times from the recipients&#x27; copies. A collection of Paul&#x27;s letters circulated separately from other early Christian writings and later became part of the New Testament. When the canon was established, the gospels and Paul&#x27;s letters were the core of what would become the New Testament.

<doc id="472292" wikidata="Q310686" url="?curid=472292" title="Dionysius the Areopagite">
<text>Dionysius the Areopagite (; &quot;Dionysios ho Areopagitēs&quot;) was an Athenian judge at the Areopagus Court in Athens, who lived in the first century. A convert to Christianity, he is venerated as a saint by multiple denominations.

==Life==

As related in the Acts of the Apostles (), he was converted to Christianity by the preaching of Paul the Apostle, being first stirred to Christian doctrine by Paul&#x27;s sermon at the Areopagus: 

After his conversion, Dionysius became the first Bishop of Athens, though he is sometimes counted as the second after Hierotheus. He is venerated as a saint in the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox churches. He is the patron saint of Athens and is venerated as the protector of judges and the judiciary. His memory is celebrated on October 3.

==Historic confusions==
In the early sixth century the so-called &quot;Corpus Dionysiacum&quot;, a series of writings of a mystical nature, employing Neoplatonic language to elucidate Christian theological and mystical ideas, was ascribed to the Areopagite. Its author is now known as Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. A minority of scholars, including Romanian theologian Dumitru Stăniloae, argue in favor of authenticity citing internal historical details and the existence of explicit citations of Dionysius predating Proclus by writers such as Dionysius of Alexandria and Gregory Nazianzus. Even Proclus himself appears to cite an external authority for a euphemism (&quot;flowers and supersubstantial lights&quot;) when the said verbiage is found explicitly in the Corpus Dionysiacum.

Dionysius has been misidentified with the martyr Dionysius, the first Bishop of Paris. However, this mistake by a ninth-century writer is ignored and each saint is commemorated on his respective day.

==Modern references==
In Athens there are two large churches bearing his name, one in Kolonaki on Skoufa Street, while the other is the Catholic Metropolis of Athens, on Panepistimiou Street. The pedestrian walkway around the Acropolis, which passes through the rock of the Areios Pagos, also bears his name.

Dionysius is the patron saint of the Gargaliani of Messenia, as well as in the village of Dionysi in the south of the prefecture of Heraklion. The village was named after him and is the only village of Crete with a church in honor of Saint Dionysios Areopagitis.

<text>Among animals which produce eggs, the yolk (; also known as the vitellus) is the nutrient-bearing portion of the egg whose primary function is to supply food for the development of the embryo. Some types of egg contain no yolk, for example because they are laid in situations where the food supply is sufficient (such as in the body of the host of a parasitoid) or because the embryo develops in the parent&#x27;s body, which supplies the food, usually through a placenta. Reproductive systems in which the mother&#x27;s body supplies the embryo directly are said to be matrotrophic; those in which the embryo is supplied by yolk are said to be lecithotrophic. In many species, such as all birds, and most reptiles and insects, the yolk takes the form of a special storage organ constructed in the reproductive tract of the mother. In many other animals, especially very small species such as some fish and invertebrates, the yolk material is not in a special organ, but inside the egg cell. 

As stored food, yolks are often rich in vitamins, minerals, lipids and proteins. The proteins function partly as food in their own right, and partly in regulating the storage and supply of the other nutrients. For example, in some species the amount of yolk in an egg cell affects the developmental processes that follow fertilization.

The yolk is not living cell material like protoplasm, but largely passive material, that is to say deutoplasm. The food material and associated control structures are supplied during oogenesis. Some of the material is stored more or less in the form in which the maternal body supplied it, partly as processed by dedicated non-germ tissues in the egg, while part of the biosynthetic processing into its final form happens in the oocyte itself.

Apart from animals, other organisms, like algae, especially in the oogamous, can also accumulate resources in their female gametes. In gymnosperms, the remains of the female gametophyte serve also as food supply, and in flowering plants, the endosperm.

== Avian egg yolk ==
In avian eggs, the yolk usually is a hue of yellow in color. It is spherical and is suspended in the egg white (known alternatively as albumen or glair/glaire) by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the chalazae.

The yolk mass, together with the ovum &quot;proper&quot; (after fertilization, the embryo) are enclosed by the vitelline membrane, whose structure is different from a cell membrane. The yolk is mostly extracellular to the oolemma, being not accumulated inside the cytoplasm of the egg cell (as occurs in frogs), contrary to the claim that the avian ovum (in strict sense) and its yolk are a single giant cell.

After the fertilization, the cleavage of the embryo leads to the formation of the germinal disc.

As food, the chicken egg yolk is a major source of vitamins and minerals. It contains all of the egg&#x27;s fat and cholesterol, and nearly half of the protein.
If left intact when an egg is fried, the yellow yolk surrounded by a flat blob of egg white creates a distinctive &quot;sunny-side up&quot; form. Mixing the two components together before cooking results in a yellow (from pale yellow to almost orange, depending on the breed of hen) mass, as in omelets and scrambled eggs.

=== Uses ===
* The developing embryo inside the egg uses the yolk as sustenance.
* It is at times separated from the egg white for cooking, and is frequently employed as an emulsifier, and is used in mayonnaise, custard, hollandaise sauce, &quot;crème brûlée&quot;, &quot;avgolemono&quot; and &quot;ovos moles&quot;.
* It is used in painting as a component of traditional egg-tempera.
* It is used in the production of egg yolk agar plate medium, useful in testing for the presence of &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot;.
* Egg yolk contains an antibody called antiglobulin (IgY). The antibody transfers from the laying hen to the egg yolk by passive immunity to protect both embryo and hatchling from microorganism invasion.
* Egg yolk can be used to make liqueurs such as Advocaat or eggnog.
* Egg yolk is used to extract egg oil which has various cosmetic, nutritional, and medicinal uses.

=== Composition of chicken egg yolk ===
The yolk makes up about 33% of the liquid weight of the egg; it contains about , three times the energy content of the egg white, mostly due to its fat content.

All of the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) are found in the egg yolk. Egg yolk is one of the few foods naturally containing vitamin D.

The composition (by weight) of the most prevalent fatty acids in egg yolk typically is:
* Unsaturated fatty acids:
** Oleic acid, 47%
** Linoleic acid, 16%
** Palmitoleic acid, 5%
** Linolenic acid, 2%
* Saturated fatty acids:
** Palmitic acid, 23%
** Stearic acid, 4%
** Myristic acid, 1%

Egg yolk is a source of lecithin, as well as egg oil, for cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications. Based on weight, egg yolk contains about 9% lecithin.

The yellow color is due to lutein and zeaxanthin, which are yellow or orange carotenoids known as xanthophylls.

=== Yolk proteins ===
The different yolk&#x27;s proteins have distinct roles. Phosvitins are important in sequestering calcium, iron, and other cations for the developing embryo. Phosvitins are one of the most phosphorylated (10%) proteins in nature; the high concentration of phosphate groups provides efficient metal-binding sites in clusters. Lipovitellins are involved in lipid and metal storage, and contain a heterogeneous mixture of about 16% (w/w) noncovalently bound lipid, most being phospholipid. Lipovitellin-1 contains two chains, LV1N and LV1C.

=== Yolk vitamins and minerals ===
Yolks hold more than 90% of the calcium, iron, phosphorus, zinc, thiamine, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, and pantothenic acid of the egg. In addition, yolks cover all of the fat-soluble vitamins: A, D, E, and K in the egg, as well as all of the essential fatty acids.

A single yolk from a large egg contains roughly 22 mg of calcium, 66 mg of phosphorus, 9.5 micrograms of selenium, and 19 mg of potassium, according to the USDA.

=== Double-yolk eggs ===

Double-yolk eggs occur when ovulation occurs too rapidly, or when one yolk becomes joined with another yolk. These eggs may be the result of a young hen&#x27;s reproductive cycle not yet being synchronized.

Double-yolked eggs seldom lead to successful hatchlings without human intervention, as the chicks interfere with each other&#x27;s hatching process and do not survive.

Higher-order yolks are rare, though hens are known to occasionally lay even triple-yolk eggs.

=== Yolkless eggs ===
Eggs without yolks are known as &quot;dwarf&quot; or &quot;wind&quot; eggs, or the archaic term &quot;cock egg&quot;. Such an egg is most often a pullet&#x27;s first effort, produced before her laying mechanism is fully ready. Mature hens rarely lay a yolkless egg, but sometimes a piece of reproductive tissue breaks away and passes down the tube. Such a scrap of tissue may stimulate the egg-producing glands to react as though it were a yolk and wrap it in albumen, membranes, and a shell as it travels through the egg tube. This is usually what causes an egg to contain a small particle of grayish tissue instead of a yolk.

Since these eggs contain no yolk, and therefore cannot hatch, they were traditionally believed to have been laid by roosters. This type of egg occurs in many varieties of fowl and has been found in chickens, both standard and bantams, guineas, and coturnix quail.

=== Yolk color ===

The color of an egg yolk is directly influenced by the makeup of the chicken feed. Egg yolk color is generally more yellow when given a feed containing a large component of yellow, fat-soluble pigments, such as the carotenes in dark green plant material, for example alfalfa. Although much emphasis is put onto the color of the egg yolk, it does not reliably reflect the nutritional value of an egg. For example, some of the natural pigments that produce a rich yolk color are xanthophylls without much nutritional value, rather than the carotenoids that act as provitamin A in the body. Also, a diet rich in vitamin A itself, but without A-provitamins or xanthophylls, can produce practically colourless yolks that are just as nutritious as any richly colored yolks.

Yolks, particularly from free-range eggs, can be of a wide range of colors, ranging from nearly white, through yellow and orange, to practically red, or even olive green, depending on the pigments in their feed. Feeding fowl large amounts of capsicum peppers, for example, tends to result in red or deep orange yolks. This has nothing to do with adding colors such as cochineal to eggs in cooking.

==In fish==
All bony fish, some sharks and rays have yolk sacs at some stage of development, with all oviparous fish retaining the sac after hatching. Lamniform sharks are ovoviviparous, in that their eggs hatch &quot;in utero&quot;; in addition to eating unfertilized eggs, unborn sharks participate in intrauterine-cannibalism: stronger pups consume their weaker womb-mates.

== In crustaceans ==

The yolk in crustacean eggs is essential for embryonic development, serving as a nutrient reservoir. In decapod crustaceans, the primary yolk precursor protein is apolipocrustacein (apoCr), which differs from the traditional vitellogenins (Vtgs) found in most oviparous animals. ApoCr shares greater structural and evolutionary similarity with insect apolipophorin II/I (apoLp-II/I) and vertebrate apolipoprotein B (apoB), distinguishing it from other members of the large lipid transfer protein (LLTP) superfamily.

ApoCr is a large glycolipoprotein, approximately 2,600 amino acids long, with conserved structural domains characteristic of LLTPs. These domains include an N-terminal lipid transfer module, a DUF1081 domain exclusive to apoLp-II/I and apoB, and a von Willebrand factor type D domain at the C-terminal. Additionally, it features a subtilisin-like cleavage site, a trait shared with apoLp-II/I. Evolutionary analyses reveal that apoCr is phylogenetically closer to apoLp-II/I than to Vtg proteins, indicating a distinct lineage for crustacean yolk proteins. In decapods, apoCr is typically expressed in both the ovary and hepatopancreas, supporting its dual roles in lipid metabolism and yolk formation. In some species, gene duplication events have resulted in multiple apoCr variants with tissue-specific functions.

<text>Dadra and Nagar Haveli is a district of the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu in western India. It is composed of two separate geographical entities: Nagar Haveli, wedged in between Maharashtra and Gujarat states to the north-west, and the smaller enclave of Dadra, which is surrounded by Gujarat. Silvassa is the administrative headquarters of Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

Unlike the surrounding areas, Dadra and Nagar Haveli was ruled by the Portuguese from 1783 until the mid-20th century. The area was captured by pro-India forces in 1954 and administered as the de facto state of Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli before being accessioned to India as a union territory, the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli in 1961. The union territory was merged with the neighbouring union territory of Daman and Diu to form the new union territory of &quot;Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu&quot; on 26 January 2020. The territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli then became one of the three districts of the new union territory, as the Dadra and Nagar Haveli district.

==History==

===Pre-Portuguese era===
The history of Dadra and Nagar Haveli begins with the defeat of the Koli chieftains of the region by the Rajput kings. In the year 1262, a Rajput prince from Rajasthan named Ram Singh established himself as the ruler of Ramnagar, the present-day Dharampur, which consisted of 8 parganas (a group of villages) and assumed the title Maharana. Nagar Haveli was one of the Parganas, and its capital was Silvassa.

In 1360, Rana Dharamshah shifted his capital from Nagar Haveli to Nagar Fatehpur.

With the rise of Maratha power, Shivaji Maharaj viewed Ramnagar as an important locality. He captured the region, but Somshah Rana recaptured it in 1690.

After the Treaty of Vasai (6 May 1739), Vasai and the surrounding territories came under the Maratha rule.

Soon after, the Marathas captured Ramnagar but reinstated the ruler, Ramdeo, under conditions. Thus the Marathas acquired the rights to collect revenue, known as &quot;chauthai&quot;. from Nagar Haveli and two other Parganas.

During the time of Dharamdeo, the son of Ramdeo, due to his change of policies (he neglected the conditions imposed earlier by the Marathas), the Marathas captured Nagar Haveli and the surrounding region.

===Portuguese era===
The Portuguese were granted the area of Nagar Haveli on 10 June 1783 on the basis of a friendship treaty executed on 17 December 1779 as compensation for damage to the Portuguese frigate &quot;Santana&quot; by the Maratha Navy in 1772. The treaty allowed the Portuguese to collect revenue from 72 villages in Nagar Haveli. Then, in 1785 the Portuguese purchased Dadra, annexing it to Portuguese State of India (&quot;Estado Português da Índia&quot;).

In 1818, the Maratha Empire was defeated by the British in the Third Anglo-Maratha War, and the Portuguese ultimately became the effective rulers of Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

Under the Portuguese rule, Dadra and Nagar Haveli were part of the &quot;Distrito de Damão&quot; (Daman district) of the &quot;Estado da Índia&quot; (Portuguese State of India). The two territories formed a single &quot;concelho&quot; (municipality), named &quot;Nagar Haveli&quot;, with its head in Darará until 1885 and, after that, with its head in the town of Silvassa. The local affairs were overseen by an elected &quot;câmara municipal&quot; (municipal council), with the higher level affairs administrated by the district governor of Daman, who was represented in Nagar Haveli by an administrator.

The Nagar Haveli &quot;concelho&quot; was itself divided in the following &quot;freguesia&quot;s (civil parishes): Silvassa, Noroli, Dadra, Quelalunim, Randá, Darará, Cadoli, Canoel, Carchonde, and Sindonim.

The Portuguese occupation lasted until 1954, when Dadra and Nagar Haveli were liberated by supporters of the Indian Union. It was the first possession to be detached from the colonial Empire by the integration with the Indian Union in 1954, after nearly two centuries of Colonial rule.

===End of Portuguese rule===
After India attained independence in 1947, the residents of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, with the help of volunteers of organisations like the United Front of Goans (UFG), the National Movement Liberation Organisation (NMLO), and the Azad Gomantak Dal, conquered the territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli from Portuguese India in 1954.

As time passed, the Indian independence struggle picked up momentum. On 18 June 1946, Ram Manohar Lohia was arrested in Goa. This was the beginning of the independence struggle in Goa. He was deported to India. On 15 August 1947, India became independent from British rule, but the Portuguese and other European colonies were not immediately incorporated.

The Goan struggle continued for many years. Atmaram Narsinh Karmalkar, an officer in the &quot;Banco Colonial&quot; (Portuguese Bank) at Panaji (in Goa) (then known as Panjim), who was popularly known as Appasaheb Karmalkar, was indirectly involved in the freedom struggle in Goa. He was dismissed from the bank and finally took up the struggle to liberate Goa. In the course of time, he realised that the liberation of DNH was crucial if Goa was to be liberated. Karmalkar reached Vapi and met Jayantibhai Desai from Dadra. He also met Bhikubhai Pandya from Nani Daman and Vanmali Bhavsar from Silvassa.

Azad Gomantak Dal under the leadership of Vishwanath Lavande, Dattatreya Deshpande, Prabhakar Sinari and others, the Communist Party under the leadership of Shamrao Parulekar and Godavaribai Parulekar, and the United Front of Goans under the leadership of Francis Mascerenhas, J.M. D&#x27;Souza, Waman Desai and others were also attempting the liberation of DNH.

On 18 June 1954, many leaders met at Lavachha. Lavachha and Vapi were Indian territories. The order in which these places lie (from east to west) is Nagar Haveli, Lavachha, Dadra, Vapi and Daman (on the sea coast). So Portuguese officers required transit permits through the Indian territories of Lavachha and Vapi to travel between N.H., Dadra, and Daman.

On the night of 22 July 1954, 15 volunteers of the United Front of Goans under the leadership of Francis Mascerenhas and Waman Desai sneaked into the territory of Dadra and reached the police station. There were only three personnel at the police station. One was attacked with a knife by one of the volunteers, and the other two were overpowered. The Indian tricolour was hoisted and the Indian National Anthem was sung. Dadra was declared the &quot;Free territory of Dadra&quot;.

On the night of 28 July, around 30 to 35 volunteers of Azad Gomantak Dal proceeded to Naroli from Karambele (Karambeli) by swimming across the rivulets. June to September is the rainy season in the region, and the rivers are usually flooded during this season. The Daman Ganga river was flooded and no help could reach Naroli. This was the reason to choose this date for proceeding to Naroli. There were only six police personnel. The volunteers and the villagers reached the police station and asked them to surrender or face death. They immediately surrendered. The Portuguese rule of Naroli came to an end.

The Special Reserve Police in the Indian Territory did not intervene. J.D. Nagarwala, the Dy. Inspector General of the Special Reserve Police in the Indian Territory, without entering DNH, asked Captain Fidalgo, the Administrator of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, to surrender to the Indian Forces along with his paramilitary forces before they would be executed by the liberators.

Leaving about 50 policemen and five civilian officers posted at Silvassa, Captain Fidalgo fled to Udva passing through Rakholi, Dappada, and Khanvel and surrendered to the SRP on 11 August. They were later allowed to go to Goa.

In the meanwhile, there were several rumours and the officers at Silvassa were in confusion. On 1 August, the liberators took advantage of the situation and proceeded from Dadra and Naroli and liberated Pipariya. The five police officers surrendered without resistance.

During the night, the volunteers divided themselves into three batches and reached the police chowky at Silvassa. The police chowky at Silvassa was protected by sandbags. There were three policemen on guard on three sides. Vasant Badve, Vishnu Bhople, and Shantaram Vaidya overpowered them from behind when least expected. The other policemen surrendered without resistance on seeing the other volunteers. The volunteers spent the night awake at the police chowky.

On the morning of 2 August 1954, the liberators reached the town of Silvassa to find it free of any Portuguese occupation. The liberation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli was complete.

Senhor Luis de Gama, the eldest nationalist, hoisted the Indian National Flag and declared the territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli liberated and the Indian National Anthem was sung.

===Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli===

From 1954 to 1961, Dadra and Nagar Haveli existed as a &quot;de facto&quot; state known as Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli. It was administered by a body called the Varishta Panchayat of Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli, with administrative help from the government of India. Although it enjoyed &quot;de facto&quot; independence, Dadra and Nagar Haveli were still recognised internationally (e.g. by the International Court of Justice) as Portuguese colony.

===Integration into India===
In 1961, amidst Indian preparation for the invasion of Goa, Daman, and Diu, K.G. Badlani, an officer of the Indian Administrative Service was, for one day, designated the Prime Minister of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, so that, as Head of State, he could sign an agreement with the Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, and formally merge Dadra and Nagar Haveli with the Republic of India. The Tenth Amendment of the Constitution of India was passed to incorporate Dadra and Nagar Haveli as a union territory, effective 11 August 1961.

On 31 December 1974 a treaty was signed between India and Portugal on recognition of India&#x27;s sovereignty over Goa, Daman, Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

In December 2019, the Parliament of India passed legislation to merge Dadra and Nagar Haveli with the nearby union territory of Daman and Diu to create a single union territory to be known as Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu on 26 January 2020. Dadra and Nagar Haveli will be one of the three districts of the new union territory.

==Geography==

The area of Dadra and Nagar Haveli is spread over . Its population density is . Though landlocked between Gujarat to the north and Maharashtra to the south, it is close to the western coast of India (between 20°0′ and 20°25′ N latitude and between 72°50′ and 73°15′ E longitude), and the Arabian Sea can be reached via Vapi in Gujarat.

Dadra and Nagar Haveli comprises two separate geographical units. The larger part—Nagar Haveli—spans a roughly C-shaped area upriver from the city of Daman on the coast, at the centre of which, straddling the border with Gujarat, is the Madhuban reservoir. The smaller enclave of Dadra is a short distance to the northwest.

Dadra and Nagar Haveli is in the middle of the undulating watershed of the Daman Ganga River, which flows through Nagar Haveli and later forms the short southern border of Dadra. The towns of Dadra and Silvassa lie on the north bank of the river. The Western Ghats range rises to the east, and the foothills of the range occupy the eastern portion of the district.

Dadra and Nagar Haveli is surrounded by Valsad District of Gujarat on the west, north, and east, and by Thane District of Maharashtra on the south and southeast (after the division of Thane District, it is now surrounded by the newly formed Palghar District).

Maghval is a small enclave village belonging to Gujarat that is located within Nagar Haveli, just south of Silvassa.

The nearest railway station are Bhilad &amp; Vapi in Gujarat on the Mumbai-Delhi route ( Western Railways ) . Bhilad is about 14 km west of Silvassa &amp; Vapi is about 18 km northwest of Silvassa. Mumbai is approximately 180 km from Silvassa. Surat city is about 140 km away. Mumbai and Surat are the nearest airports.

===Topography===
The stretch of the main southern area is hilly terrain especially towards the northeast and east where it is surrounded by ranges of the Sahyadri mountains (Western Ghats). The central alluvial region of the land is almost plain and the soil is fertile and rich. The river Damanganga rises in the Ghat 64 km from the western coast and discharges itself in the Arabian Sea at the port of Daman after crossing Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Its three tributaries, Varna, Pipri and Sakartond, join Daman Ganga within the territory.

===Flora and fauna===

Dadra and Nagar Haveli lies within the North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests ecoregion, characterised by forests of teak (&quot;Tectona grandis&quot;) and other dry-season deciduous trees.
About 43% of the land is under forest cover. However, the reserved forest territory constitutes about 40% of the total geographical area. The protected forests constitute 2.45% of the total land area.

According to satellite data taken in 2008, DNH has roughly about of moderately dense forest and open forest. According to the Forest Survey of India, DNH has two major forest types: tropical moist deciduous forest and tropical dry deciduous forest. The major produce is khair wood and general timber. Teak, sandra, khair, mahara and sisam are the major tree species in the region.
 Tree cover has been estimated around 27 km2 from the six-year data (2002–08), which is around 5.5% of the total geographical area of DNH.

The Dadra and Nagar Haveli Wildlife Sanctuary covers 91.39 square kilometres, or about 19% of the union territory&#x27;s total area. The sanctuary provides a habitat for leopard (&quot;Panthera pardus&quot;), wildcat (&quot;Felis silvestris&quot;), striped hyena (&quot;Hyaena hyaena&quot;), fox (&quot;Vulpes&quot; spp.), golden jackal (&quot;Canis aureus&quot;), nilgai (&quot;Boselaphus tragocamelus&quot;), four-horned antelope (&quot;Tetracerus quadricornis&quot;), sambar deer (&quot;Rusa unicolor&quot;), and chital deer (&quot;Axis axis&quot;), and birds including black drongo, bulbul, kingfisher, egret, hoopoe, mynah, heron, and red jungle fowl. In 2014 an additional eco-sensitive area was designated in the 100-meter buffer zone around the wildlife sanctuary, with an area of 26.57 square kilometres.

The rich biodiversity makes it a habitat for a variety of birds and animals and thus a destination for inland and coastal safari and eco-tourism. Silvassa&#x27;s hills and wide, forested buffer land attract wildlife enthusiasts.

There is a wildlife protected area located,

* Dadra and Nagar Haveli Wildlife Sanctuary

===Climate===
The climate of Dadra and Nagar Haveli is typical of its type. Being near the coast, all but the sparsely inhabited easternmost parts have a typical north Indian Ocean maritime climate. The summers are hot and become in their later part more humid with temperatures reaching as high as 39 °C in the month of May. The monsoon starts in the month of June and extends until September. The rainfall is brought by southwest monsoon winds. It is known as the Cherrapunji that covers the bulk of western India (apart from the Thar Desert) which produces most of the annual rainfall of 200–250 cm. Winters are between maritime temperate and semi-tropical with temperatures ranging from 14 °C to 30 °C, reliably, as with the monsoon, with scant deviation from this range.

==Administration==
Dadra and Nagar Haveli covers an area of 487 km2 and consists of two sub-districts:
* Dadra
* Nagar Haveli

===Dadra===
Dadra is the headquarters of Dadra taluka, comprising Dadra town and two other villages.

===Nagar Haveli===
Silvassa is the headquarters of Nagar Haveli taluka, comprising Silvassa town and 68 other villages.

==Economy==
Dadra and Nagar Haveli&#x27;s gross state domestic product for 2004 is estimated at $218 million in current prices. Its nominal GDP increased to $360 million in the year 2009 with a per capita GDP of $1,050. The economy of DNH relies on five major activities viz. agriculture, industries, forestry, animal husbandry and tourism.

===Agriculture===

The basic economic activity of the territory is agriculture involving about 60% of the working population. The total land area under cultivation is i.e. 48% of the total geographical area. The area under high yielding crops is . The main food crops cultivated in this area are paddy (40% of the net sown area), &quot;ragi&quot;, small millets, jowar, sugarcanes, &quot;tur&quot;, &quot;nagli&quot; and &quot;val&quot;. Vegetables like tomato, cauliflower, cabbage and brinjal and fruits like mango, chikoo, guava, coconut and banana are also grown. Agriculture sector has given a major boost to the economy of DNH.

The local population is also involved in forestry and animal husbandry. 92.76% of the farmers belong to the weaker sections and 89.36% of them are tribal farmers. There is a full-fledged veterinary hospital and nine veterinary dispensaries. Mass vaccination against various diseases is done regularly free of cost by the Animal Husbandry Department.

===Industry===

Another major contributor to the economy is the manufacturing industries. Due to heavy industrialisation in the region owing to tax sops for industries in the union territories, steady growth in employment has been observed. The employment generation is increasing at a pace of 5% per annum.

Industrialisation in the area began in 1965 when the first industrial unit in the UT was started at Piparia, Silvassa in the cooperative sector by Dan Udyog Sahakari Sangh Ltd, following which three industrial estates were established at Masat (1976), Khadoli (1982) and Silvassa (1985). Earlier (before 1965) only traditional craftsmen who made clay pots, leather items, viz., chappals, shoes and some other items of bamboo were present. Since there was no sales tax in the UT, it attracted many entrepreneurs. Around 30 new units comprising Engineering, fabric weaving units and dyeing and printing units were established until 1970.

In 1971, UT was declared as an industrially backward area by Government of India and increased the cash subsidy to 15 to 25% for the industrial units on their capital investment which resulted in the speedy industrial development. The scheme was however terminated from 30 September 1988. Sales Tax Act was implemented from January 1984 until 1998 under which industries enjoyed sales tax exemption for 15 years from the start-up date. VAT was introduced in 2005. At present, the newly established units get Central Sales Tax exemption which will continue until 2017.

There are more than 2710 units functioning providing employment to about 46000 people with a capital investment of .
==Demographics==
According to the 2011 census Dadra and Nagar Haveli has a population of 343,709. This gives it a ranking of 566th in India, out of a total of 640 districts. It has a population density of , and its population growth rate over the decade from 2001 to 2011 was 55.5 percent, which is the highest percentage growth among all Indian states and union territories. Dadra and Nagar Haveli has a sex ratio of 775 females for every 1,000 males, and a literacy rate of 77.65%.

=== Ethnography ===
Tribal groups make up a large part of the population viz 62%. The most prominent are Dhodia (16.90%), Kokna (16.85%) and Warli (62.94%), with small groups of Koli, Kathodi, Naika, and Dubla scattered across the territory, collectively representing 3.31% of the population. Dhodias and Dublas mainly populate the Northern part, whereas Koknas and Warlis are found all over the Union Territory. They worship the primary deities of Dis (Sun) and Chand (Moon), and Narandev, Kanasari, Himai, Hirva, Veer, Rangtai and Vagdev.

One prominent feature of this territory is that people from all over India form a part of non-tribal residents. DNH has many industries due to tax concessions granted to industry and therefore people from all over the country have migrated to the region.
North Indians have a prime influence in the area. Gujarati is one of the three official languages, the others being Hindi and English. Besides Gujarati persons, one can find Marathi, Rajasthani, Bihari, Udia, Tamil, Uttar Pradeshi and people from several other states. The prime reason for such a diverse population is the industrial hub. Employment opportunities, good climate, and the landscape are highly appealing.

===Religion===
As per the 2001 Census, out of the 137,225 ST persons of the UT, almost all were Hindus except for 3,796 Christians (2.8%). As a former Portuguese enclave, Silvassa has a significant Roman Catholic population. Kokna has the highest Christian population in 2001, 6.7%. Swetambara Jains have a temple in Dadra and Silvassa and recently Digambara Jains have also constructed a temple in the Silvassa.

===Language===
There are 72 villages, mainly inhabited by various tribal communities like the Warly (Warlie), Kokana, Dhodia, Koli, Kathodi, Naika, Dubla and Kolgha. The tribal communities are locally known as Adivasi (which means original inhabitant). Each community has its own culture, traditions and languages and dialects. None of these languages have had written literature until recently. The tribal communities consist of approximately 60% of the population of DNH. (Earlier in the eighties it was more than 80%, but after influx from different parts of the country, the percentage has reduced). But the influx has helped the tribal people in increasing their earnings and standard of living.

Warli is the language spoken by the Warli people. Agri the dialect of Marathi which is spoken by Agri community.

The languages taught in schools in Dadra and Nagar Haveli under the three-language formula are as follows:

#First Language: Gujarati, Hindi, Marathi
#Second Language: Marathi, Gujarati
#Third Language: English

A former Portuguese enclave, Silvassa has a significant Roman Catholic population, speaking a distinct dialect of Portuguese. Marathi and Gujarati languages are widely spoken. Hindi and Marathi are also understood.

The main tribes are Warlis, Dhodia Kokna, etc.

===Castes===
The prominent castes occupying this territory are Rajputs, Ahirs, Chamar, Mahar, and associated castes.

===Tribes===
Warli
Although commonly associated with Maharashtra, and also found in Gujarat, Warlis consider the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli to be their original home. The Warlis speak an Indo-Aryan language related to Marathi and Konkani and are the largest tribal group in the territory and constitute ~ 63% (62.94%) of the total tribal population.

Rituals are extremely important to the Warlis; they are nature worshipers who regard the Sun and the Moon as the eyes of God. Their main deities are Naran dev, Hirwa, Himai, and Waghio, and stone images of these deities are found in tree groves. A Bhagat plays the Ghangal (a musical instrument made from gourd, bamboo and iron strings) and performs the rituals.

Traditionally the Warlis wear a loin cloth with a small waist coat and a turban. The women wear a knee-length, one-yard saree – lugde – and adorn themselves with silver and white metal ornaments.

Dhodia

The term Dhodia seems to be derived from Dhundi, which means a small thatched hut, and the Dhodias are primarily hut dwellers. They reside mostly in the northern part of Dadra &amp; Nagar Haveli. They are known to be the most educated among all the tribes and are good cultivators. Some own enough farmland to be able to earn a decent livelihood.

Traditionally the men wear a white knee-length dhoti with a shirt or waistcoat, white or coloured caps, and ornaments like earrings and silver chains around their waist. The women wear a knee-length dark blue saree with an &quot;aanchal&quot; worn from the front and left loose at the back. Popular accessories include colourful bead necklaces, and metal ornaments such as bangles or thick &quot;kadaas&quot; around their ankles.

Kokna

The Koknas derive their name from the Konkan region in West India. They have land of their own, produce paddy and are better cultivators than the Warlis. With the introduction of formal education many of them have moved up the social ladder.

Koknas well built and both men and women often tattoo their bodies, especially their foreheads. The men wear a dhoti up to the knees, with a waistcoat or shirt and a turban. The women wear traditional colourful sarees that are either knee-length or full length.

Kathodia

The Kathodis, called Katkari in the Thane district of Maharashtra, make up 0.08% of the total tribal population of Dadra &amp; Nagar Haveli. Their name is derived from their profession of kattha or catechu making.

They are considered to be at the bottom of the tribal social ladder. They usually live in forests, in semi-permanent settlements. Most of them cut wood and collect charcoal. The government has tried to improve their standard of living by engaging them in permanent professions.
They wear minimal jewelry; what is worn adorns the women only.

<text>Chuvashia, officially known as Chuvash Republic — Chuvashia, is a republic of Russia located in Eastern Europe. It is the homeland of the Chuvash people, a Turkic ethnic group. Its capital is the city of Cheboksary. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 1,251,619.

==Geography==
The Chuvash Republic is located in the center of European Russia, in the heart of the Volga-Vyatka economic region, mostly to the west of the Volga River, in the Volga Upland. It borders with the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast in the west, Mari El Republic in the north, the Republic of Tatarstan in the east and southeast, Republic of Mordovia in the southwest, and the Ulyanovsk Oblast in the south. There are over two thousand rivers in the republic—with the major ones being the Volga, the Sura, and the Tsivil—as well as four hundred lakes. Some of the Volga River valley reservoirs are in the north of the republic, and the Sura River flows towards the Volga along much of the republic&#x27;s western boundary. 

The climate is moderately continental, with the average temperatures ranging from in January to in July. Annual precipitation varies between , but is uneven from one year to another. Natural resources include gypsum, sand, clay, sapropel deposits, phosphorite, and peat. There are oil and natural gas deposits, although their extraction has not yet been commercially pursued. Forests, mostly in the south along the Sura River, cover approximately 30% of the land.

==History==

The ancestors of the Chuvash were Bulgars and Suars, Oghur Turkic tribes residing in the Northern Caucasus in the 5th to 8th centuries. In the 7th and 8th centuries, a part of the Bulgars left for the Balkans, where, together with local South Slavs, they established the state of modern Bulgaria. Another part moved to the Middle Volga Region (see Volga Bulgaria), where the Bulgar population that did not adopt Islam formed the foundation of the Chuvash people.

During the Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria, the steppe-dwelling Suar migrated north, where Volga Finnic tribes, such as the Mordvins and Mari lived. The Chuvash claim to be the descendants of these Suars who assimilated with the Mari. In 1242, they became vassals of the Golden Horde. Later Mongol and Tatar rulers did not intervene in local internal affairs as long as tribute was paid annually to Sarai. When the power of the Golden Horde began to diminish, local Mişär Tatar Murzas from Piana and Temnikov tried to govern the Chuvash area.

During Ivan the Terrible&#x27;s war of conquest against the Khanate of Kazan, in August 1552, the Chuvash Orsai and Mari Akpar Tokari princes swore their loyalty to the Grand Duchy of Muscovy at Alatyr on the Sura River. Between 1650 and 1850, the Russian Orthodox Church sent Chuvash-speaking missionaries to try to convert the Chuvash to the Orthodox faith. A group of these missionaries created a written Chuvash language. Most of the Chuvash who stayed in the area became Orthodox Christians, but some remained pagan.

On 15 May 1917, the Chuvash joined the Idel-Ural Movement and in December 1917 joined the short-lived Idel-Ural State, when an agreement was reached with Tatar representatives to draw the eastern border of Chuvashia at the Sviyaga River. Between 1918 and 1919, the Russian Civil War encompassed the area. This ended with victory for the Bolsheviks. To gain support from the local population, Lenin ordered the creation of a Chuvash state within the Russian SFSR. On 24 June 1920, the Chuvash Autonomous Oblast was formed, which was transformed into the Chuvash ASSR in April 1925.

==Administrative divisions==
==Politics==

Until 2012, the Chuvash Republic officially had the status of a state. In the constitution of Chuvashia (version 6, dated 13 September 2011 No. 46), the following was fixed: &quot;The Chuvash Republic is a republic (state) within the Russian Federation.&quot;

During the Soviet period, the high authority in the republic was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Chuvashia CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the Republic Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Republic administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament.

The Charter of Republic of Chuvashia is the fundamental law of the region. The State Council of the Chuvash Republic is the republic&#x27;s regional standing legislative (representative) body. The highest executive body is the Republic&#x27;s Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters.

==Demographics==
Despite not being large, the republic is one of the most densely populated regions in the Russian Federation. Its population was

The capital and largest city of Chuvashia is Cheboksary, with a population of around 464,000 as of 2010. Cheboksary is situated mostly on the southern bank of the Volga in the northern part of the republic (one northern bank district was added in the second part of the 20th century), approximately east of Moscow. Nearby to the east is the next largest city, Novocheboksarsk, with a population of 124,000 as of 2010.

Note: TFR

===Ethnic groups===
According to the 2021 Census, ethnic Chuvash make up 63.7% of the republic&#x27;s population. Other groups include Russians (30.7%), Tatars (2.7%), Mordvins (0.7%), and a host of smaller groups, each accounting for less than 0.5% of the total population.
=== Genetics ===
Osteopetrosis affects 1 newborn out of every 20,000 to 250,000 worldwide, but the odds are much higher in the Russian region of Chuvashia (1 of every 3,500–4,000 newborns) due to genetic traits of the Chuvash people.

===Religion===
According to a 2012 survey, 64.7% of the population of Chuvashia adheres to the Russian Orthodox Church, 4% are Orthodox Christian believers without belonging to any church or members of non-Russian Orthodox churches, 3% of the population (mostly Tatars) follow Islam, 3% are unaffiliated Christians, 1% follow indigenous faiths (&quot;Vattisen Yaly&quot;, Chuvash folk religion). In addition, 24% of the population declares to be &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot;, 1% is atheist and 2.3% follows other religions or did not answer to the question. There is a growing population of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses among the people despite the official ban by the Russian Government.

Study of religion is compulsory for schoolchildren in Chuvashia. Of the students, approximately 76.9% are enrolled for Orthodox Studies, 16.0% for Secular Studies, 15.7% for World Religions Studies and 1.4% for Islamic Studies.

===Education===
There are five higher educational institutions, including the Chuvash State University, the Chuvash State Pedagogical University, and the Chuvash State Agrarian University located in Cheboksary. These, together with 28 colleges and technical schools, are currently attended by approximately 45,000 students.

==Economy==

The Chuvash Republic is the most populous and fertile area in the middle Volga region. There are deciduous woodlands on fertile black earth. In agriculture, wheat and sugar-beet, pigs and beef cattle have become more important than the rye, oats, barley and dairy cattle which are typical for the whole area.

The republic is Russia&#x27;s center for growing hops and is famous throughout the country for its long history of beer brewing. It is also a major center for electrical engineering, especially in the area of power transmission and control systems. Other leading industries are metalworking, electricity generation, and chemical manufacturing. There are also large timber-working mills at Shumerlin.

The largest companies in the region include Khimprom Novocheboksarsk (revenues of $ million in 2017), Accond (confectionery maker$, million), Cheboksary Instrument-Making Plant ($ million), NPP EKRA (power engineering$, million).

==Transportation==
The transport network in the republic is one of the most developed in Russia. The republic&#x27;s system of roads, railroads, waterways, and airports closely ties the region with others in and outside of Russia.

===Roads===
Only four roads in the Chuvash Republic are classified as important federal highways. The most important is Highway M-7, which runs from Nizhny Novgorod through the northern parts of the republic from Yadrinsky Nikolskoye via Malye Tyumerli, Kalmykovo, Khyrkasy, Novye Lapsary, Kugesi, Shivlinsk, Staraya Tyurlema, to Kazan in the Republic of Tatarstan. It also forms a connection via Chuvashia through the southern suburbs of Cheboksary and Novocheboksary to the Mari El Republic and the Vyatka Highway. Part of this road is classified as a motorway, the only one in the republic. From Yadrinsky Nikolskoye, the federal road P-178 runs through Yadrin, Shumerlya, Alatyr, to Surskoye in Ulyanovsk Oblast and further to Ulyanovsk. In the eastern part of Chuvashia, the federal road A-151 runs from Tsivilsk through Kanash, Komsomolskoye, Chkalovskoye, Karabay-Shemursha, Shemursha to Ulyanovsk and Saratov. All other roads in Chuvashia are classified as local area roads.

Automobiles, trucks, and buses are the major forms of transportation, with the republic ranking fourth in highway density in all of Russia. Cheboksary is situated on one of the main highways of the Russian Federation leading from Moscow to the industrial areas of Tatarstan, the southern Urals, and Siberia. A recently completed bridge across the Volga River in the north connects the republic to the developed Ural and Volga Federal Districts. To the south, highways connect Chuvashia with Saratov and Volgograd. Extensive public and private bus systems connect all towns within the republic with each other and with the surrounding regions.

The standard speed of transportation of containers by road is per day. The average time of delivery from Cheboksary to Moscow is 1.5 days; to Saint Petersburg, 2.5 days; and to Western Europe, 10 to 15 days.

===Railways===
The railway network is highly developed, convenient, and accessible year-round. One of the largest railway junctions of Russia – Kanash—is in the center of the republic. Via Kanash, the rail system connects the major towns in Chuvashia with the big industrial centers of eastern Siberia, the Urals, and Moscow. Express trains are reliable and provide a low-cost, comfortable way to travel. Express trains to and from Moscow are available every day, with the overnight journey taking approximately fourteen hours each way.

The following lines serve railway traffic in the Chuvash Republic:
*Arzamas-Kanash line
*Krasny Usel – Kanash -Sviyazhsk line
*Kanash – Cheboksary II – Cheboksary I – Cheboksary II – Novocheboksarsk line

In addition to these lines, there are of gauge industrial lines running from Altyshevo station, on Alatyr-Kanash section, to Pervomaysky, located just west of Starye Aybesi in Alatyrsky District.

All railway lines in Chuvashia are operated by the MPS Gorky Railway Division. Steam locomotives were mostly replaced in 1970 by diesel locomotives and when the main Arzamas-Kanash-Sviyazhsk line was electrified, the diesel locomotives were replaced by electric ones.

The Arzamas-Kanash-Sviyazhsk line is a double track main line, while the others are single track lines. The 84 km (52 mi) Sviyazhsk-Kanash section was electrified in 1986, the 142 km (88 mi) Kanash-Sergach section in 1987.

In 1967, there were four daily passenger trains in both directions on the Alatyr-Kanash line. One of them was the semifast Sochi-Sverdlovsk-Sochi long-distance transit train, halting only at Alatyr, Buinsk, and Kanash. Cheboksary was connected by daily semifast passenger train to Moscow. The travel time was 17.30 hours for the 758 km (471 mi) journey. 21 express and passenger trains used the Arzamas-Kanash-Sviyazhsk main line in the summer high season in both directions. Of these, four did not halt in Chuvashia. Most of the remaining semifast trains stopped at Shumerlya, Piner, Burnary, and Kanash. Four pairs of semifast trains also stopped at Tyurmari. In the 1999–2000 timetable, 11 pairs of Moscow-Kanash-Kazan express trains stopped at Kanash. The Chuvashia 53/54 express trains between Moscow and Kanash took 11.23 hours, back 10.57 hours.

In addition to Russian gauge railways, there were six narrow-gauge railway lines: two short peat briquette industry lines at Severny and Sosnovka on the north side of the Volga, and four forest railways at Shumerlya, Atrat and Kirya. All opened in the 1930s. In 1965, their total length was :
*Shumerlya-Kabanovo-Rechnoy-Burak-Krasnobar forest railway – total length 
*Shumerlya-Kumashka-Salantshik-Yakhaykino forest railway – 
*Kirya-Lesopunkt Lyulya forest railway – 
*Atrat-Dolnaya Polyana-Lesozavod Gart forest railway – 

All lines were closed in the economic uncertainty after the breakup of the Soviet Union.

===Rivers===

The Volga and Sura Rivers connect Chuvashia to a national and international water network. To the south, Volgograd, Rostov-on-Don, Astrakhan, the Caspian Sea, and Black Sea are directly reachable. To the west, the Volga River connects Cheboksary with Nizhny Novgorod, Yaroslavl, Moscow and the northern regions of Russia. By using river-sea vessels, cargo transportation is possible from Chuvash river ports all the way to Saint Petersburg, Novorossiysk (on the Black Sea), Astrakhan, and ports situated on the Danube River. However, the river is frozen from December through April. Cheboksary is a frequent stop on the many boat tours of the Volga.

===Air===
The international Cheboksary Airport receives both cargo and passenger aircraft of practically all types and sizes. There are regularly scheduled flights to Moscow and other destinations. Additionally, Cheboksary is about a four-hour drive from Strigino International Airport, the airport primarily serving Nizhny Novgorod, which offers a greater number of flights, including connections through Aeroflot and Belavia.

==Culture==
While Russian is the predominant business language, the Chuvash language is still spoken by many, especially in the country. The Chuvash language belongs to the Oghur subgroup of the Turkic language group. In ancient times a runic system of writing was used. Chuvashi now uses a modified Cyrillic script that was adopted in 1871.

There has been a resurgence of native Chuvash pride, with many people looking back to their Chuvash roots and exploring the culture and heritage and relearning the language. Most building signs, road signs, and announcements are in both Russian and Chuvash.

At present Chuvash Republic has six professional theaters:

*Chuvash State Opera and Ballet Theater
*Chuvash State Academic Drama Theater
*Chuvash State Academic Song and Dance Ensemble
*Chuvash Children&#x27;s Theater
*Chuvash State Puppet Theater

*Russian State Drama Theater
*Chuvash State Youth Theater
*Chuvash State Experimental Drama Theater

and over 30 amateur theaters, a Philharmonic Society, an Academic Folk Song and Dance Group, an Academic Choir, a Chamber Orchestra, and some professional concert groups.

<text>Cheboksary is the capital city of Chuvashia, Russia. It is a port on the Volga River.

==Geography==
The city is located in the Volga Upland region and stands on the shore of the Cheboksary Reservoir. Its area is . The satellite city of Novocheboksarsk is located about east of Cheboksary.

==History==
Cheboksary was first mentioned in written sources in 1469, but according to archaeological excavations, the area had been populated much earlier. The site hosted a Bulgarian city of Veda Suvar, which appeared after Mongols defeated major Volga Bulgarian cities in the 13th century. During Khanate period the town is believed by some to have had a Turkic (probably, Tatar) name Çabaqsar and that the current Russian and English names originate from it. However, in maps by European travelers it was marked as Cibocar (Pizzigano, 1367), Veda-Suar (Fra Mauro, 1459). Shupashkar, the Chuvash name literally means the &quot;fortress of the Chuvash&quot;.

In 1555, the Russians built a fortress and established a settlement here. In 1625, there were 458 soldiers quartered in Cheboksary, and in 1646 there were 661 males living in the settlement. At the end of the 17th century, Cheboksary was regarded as a major commercial city of the Volga region, and in 1781 it was granted town status within Kazan Governorate. In the beginning of the 19th century the population was about 5500, the town had a sawmill and several small manufactures.

In the 16th and the first half of the 17th century the Vvedensky cathedral, four monasteries and eight churches had been built, in the 18th century the stone buildings of treasury and archive, magistracy, court, and ten churches. In 1880, here were counted 783 houses (33 of them from stone), 91 stores, three schools, two hospitals, and one bank.

In the beginning of the 20th century, 5,100 people lived in Cheboksary. In 1965, the population grew to 163,000.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Cheboksary is the capital of the republic. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with two urban-type settlements (Novye Lapsary and Sosnovka) and two rural localities, incorporated as the city of republic significance of Cheboksary—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of republic significance of Cheboksary is incorporated as Cheboksary Urban Okrug.

===City divisions===
For administrative purposes, Cheboksary is divided into three city districts: Kalininskiy, Leninskiy, and Moskovskiy.

==Demographics==
Population: 

The city of Cheboksary together with the satellite city Novocheboksarsk forms a polycentric agglomeration with a population of more than 680 thousand people.

===Ethnic composition===
The population of Cheboksary consists mainly of the two following ethnic groups; the Chuvash (62%), and ethnic Russians (34%). Mixed marriages are quite common.

==Culture==
Cheboksary possesses many cultural opportunities. These include the Public Order (Badge of Honor) Russian Drama Theater, a philharmonic orchestra, the Chuvash State Puppet Theater and numerous theaters (showing productions in both Russian and Chuvash languages). However, a very popular gathering place for the locals is the recently completed &quot;zaliv&quot; (bay), situated in the middle of the city. Cheboksary also has boardwalks and beaches along the Volga River, where people swim in the summer. There are also a number of heated pools, health clubs, and museums (including the Chuvash National Museum and Russia&#x27;s only beer museum).

Cheboksary hosted a language festival in 1996.

===Sport===
Cheboksary regularly hosts athletics meetings and racewalking events, including the 2008 IAAF World Race Walking Cup, the 2015 European Team Championships Super League, and the 2016 Russian athletics and masters athletics championships. The 2016 IAAF World Race Walking Team Championships were moved from Cheboksary to Rome as part of IAAF sanctions against doping in Russia.

==Education==
Educational institutions include the Chuvash State University, Chuvash State Agriculture Academy, the Chuvash State Pedagogical University, and the Cheboksary Cooperative Technical School.

==Transportation==

=== Local public transportation ===

An extensive system of trolleybuses, autobuses, and minibuses covers the city, providing quick, convenient access to all parts of the city. For those who prefer taxis, there are several taxi agencies available, but the favorite means of transportation among locals are so-called &quot;Gypsy&quot; cabs. In Russia, anybody who owns a car is potentially a taxi. This can be a convenient way to get around but it is also potentially dangerous. Official taxis cost less than 6 dollars for travel between most points within the city.

=== River ===

Because the Volga River runs through Chuvashia, Cheboksary is a frequent stop on the many boat tours that travel along the major cities up and down the Volga.
To the south, Volgograd, Rostov-on-Don, Astrakhan, the Caspian Sea, and Black Sea are directly reachable. To the west, the Volga River connects Cheboksary with Nizhny Novgorod, Yaroslavl, Moscow, and the northern regions of Russia. By using river-sea vessels, it is possible to take cargo from Chuvash riverports all the way to Saint Petersburg, Novorossiysk (on the Black Sea), Astrakhan, and ports situated on the Danube river. However, the river is frozen from December to April.

The Cheboksary Airport (IATA CSY, ICAO UWKS, international airport since 1995) receives both cargo and passenger aircraft of practically all types and sizes. There are regularly scheduled flights to Moscow and other destinations. Chuvashia Airlines was based at this airport until operations ceased in 2009.
Cheboksary is located about a four-hour drive from Strigino International Airport near Nizhny Novgorod, which offers more flight connections.

==Climate==
The climate in the region is continental (Köppen: Dfb), and it is similar to the climate in Moscow, although colder in winter, which lasts from late November until late March with a permanent snow cover.

<doc id="472307" wikidata="Q735544" url="?curid=472307" title="Taboo (game)">
<text>Taboo is a word, guessing, and party game published by Parker Brothers in 1989 (subsequently purchased by Hasbro). The objective of the game is for a player to have their partners guess the word on the player&#x27;s card without using the word itself or five additional words listed on the card.

The game is similar to Catch Phrase, also from Hasbro, in which a player tries to get their teammates to guess words using verbal clues.

From 2003, a TV game show adaptation ran on TNN, hosted by Chris Wylde.

==Equipment==
* A large number of double sided cards, early Taboo editions had pink lettering one side, and blue the other side. Later editions used a variety of colours for the cards either side, such as pink, blue, green, purple, yellow, orange and red. The guess word is at the top of the card and five taboo words below. These words can not be spoken by the clue-giver.
* Box to keep the cards in (1989 to 2000).
* Tray for holding cards.
* Timer (in the form of a one-minute hourglass).
* Buzzer or round squeaker. The 1989 edition has a turquoise electronic buzzer. The 1990, 1993 and 1994 editions have a pink squeaker. The 1999 and 2000 editions have a purple squeaker or electronic buzzer. 2003 edition has a red squeaker. The 2011 edition has a yellow and white electronic buzzer. 2013 edition has a purple squeaker. The 2016 edition has a purple buzzer. The 2023 edition has a yellow squeaker.
* Score pad and (pencil - mainly in early editions).
* Game board includes two tokens for moving round the board. The 1996, 2000 (UK &amp; European), 2003 and 2010 editions only have the game board. The game board is the same design, and has same number of spaces, the only difference is colour. However, the 2000 edition is unique in its colour design and stands out against the other game boards.
* Game changing &quot;die&quot;, this was used in the 2011 and 2013 editions only.

In 1990, Hasbro sold packs of additional words, but they are no longer in production.

Taboo Junior, the game for younger players, includes a purple squeaker.

==Rules==
An even number of players from four to ten sit alternating around in a circle. Players take turns as the &quot;giver&quot;, who attempts to prompt their teammates to guess as many keywords as possible in the allotted time. However, each card also has &quot;taboo&quot; (forbidden) words listed which may not be spoken. Should the giver say one, a &quot;censor&quot; on the opposing team hits the buzzer and the giver must move on to the next word. For example, the giver might have to get their team to deduce the word &quot;baseball&quot; without offering the words &quot;sport&quot;, &quot;game&quot;, &quot;pastime&quot;, &quot;hitter&quot;, &quot;pitcher&quot;, or &quot;baseball&quot; itself as clues. The giver may not say a part of a &quot;taboo&quot; word; for example, using &quot;base&quot; in &quot;baseball&quot; is taboo. Nor may they use a form of a word; for example, if the word was &quot;wedding&quot; and the taboo words are &quot;marriage&quot;, &quot;bride&quot;, &quot;groom&quot;, &quot;nuptials&quot;, or &quot;honeymoon&quot;, the words &quot;marry&quot; and &quot;bridal&quot; would not be allowed. The giver may only use speech to prompt their teammates; gestures, sounds (e.g., barking), or drawings are not allowed. Singing is permitted, provided the singer is singing words rather than humming or whistling a tune. The giver&#x27;s hints may not rhyme with a taboo word or be an abbreviation of a taboo word.

While the giver is prompting the teammates, they may make as many guesses as they want with no penalties for wrong guesses. Once the team correctly guesses the word exactly as written on the card, the giver moves on to the next word, trying to get as many words as possible in the allotted time. When time runs out, play passes to the next adjacent player of the other team. The playing team receives one point for correct guesses and one penalty point if &quot;taboo&quot; words are spoken.

==Variations==
There have been many editions and design changes of Taboo, with updated cards, a game board, or the game changing die. It has also been manufactured in French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Greek, Hebrew, Polish, Czech and Swedish. The early European Taboo editions, that came with a game board, had a unique design, different to the UK version.

There is 2005 &quot;Aussie&quot; cards edition for Australia, and the 2011 edition was also produced with Singaporean words.

From 1990 to 1999 Taboo has the original design, tall yellow lettering for the word Taboo, with the colours red, orange, blue, green and turquoise on the front, with the familiar picture of the smiling face and hand covering the mouth. Since its first release and later editions, purple is quite a prominent colour used in the colour scheme.

From 2000 to 2011 the lettering for the word Taboo was redesigned with an almost cartoon type yellow lettering, with various colours used on each new edition, however the familiar face stayed the same.
The 2003 and 2010 UK Taboo game, contain exactly the same cards, using the same Taboo words, all that was changed were the colours. Otherwise both are identical.

From 2013 to 2023 Taboo had a totally redesigned look, especially with the lettering, and the front of the box had a plain purple or black colour, however, the familiar face stayed the same.

<text>Oronsay (), also sometimes spelt and pronounced Oransay by the local community, is a small tidal island south of Colonsay in the Scottish Inner Hebrides with an area of .

The island rises to a height of at Beinn Orasaigh and is linked to Colonsay by a tidal causeway called &quot;An Tràigh&quot; (The Strand) consisting of sands and mud flats. In the 2001 census Oronsay was recorded as having a population of five people, who lived at the farm adjacent to Oronsay Priory. In 2011 the population had risen to eight. The island has no facilities for visitors and is now privately owned, with the RSPB farming the island for the American owner. It is dependent upon tidal access to and from Colonsay. There is a small grass air strip south of the priory that &quot;fights a losing battle with the rabbits&quot;.

==Etymology==
There are two theories for the origin of the name from Old Norse. Either it is &quot;Oran&#x27;s Isle&quot;, St Oran being imagined as the founder of the island&#x27;s original monastery in 563, (Murray (1966) states that the original Gaelic name was &quot;Eilean Orain&quot;) or it may be from the Old Norse &quot;Örfirisey&quot; meaning &quot;island of the ebb tide&quot;.

==Prehistory==
Both Oronsay and neighbouring Colonsay have furnished archaeologists with invaluable information about the Mesolithic period of prehistory, particularly about the diet of human beings. Three middens on Oronsay were opened in the 1880s and have provided a piece of bone carbon-dated to 4600 BC and an oyster shell to 3065 BC. Evidence provided from saithe bones in the middens suggest that the local population lived there all year round and were heavily reliant on marine protein. Site datings on Colonsay and Islay suggest an absence of human habitation in the area from 5250–4750 BC for unknown reasons.

There is comparatively little evidence for life during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages although a picture emerges of &quot;small farming communities and changes in technology occurring slowly over a long period of time&quot; on Colonsay and environs. By the close of the Iron Age around 500 AD Colonsay and Oronsay were part of the Gaelic-speaking Kingdom of Dál Riata although which of the main Dalriadan kindreds controlled them is unknown. The founding of the fort of Dùn Eibhinn on Colonsay that overlooks Oronsay dates from this period.

==Religious history==

Watson (2004) mentions Oronsay as a possible candidate for the site of Hinba, an island in Scotland of uncertain location that was the site of a small monastery associated with the Columban church on Iona.

The site of a Norse ship burial has been found on Oronsay and another on Colonsay dated to the mid 9th century at which point these islands were likely part of the far-flung Kingdom of the Isles. Following the 1266 Treaty of Perth the Hebrides were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland and the Gaelic language re-asserted its dominant position in the southern Hebrides.

Oronsay also had a medieval Augustinian priory, the ruins of which are still extant. It was built 1380, possibly on the site of an earlier church (for whose existence there is actually no surviving evidence), perhaps founded by John of Islay, Lord of the Isles. By the early 16th century a distinct &#x27;school&#x27; of monumental sculpture flourished on Oronsay. Two substantial celtic crosses sit outside the perimeter of the buildings and many slabs with effigies or other carvings are still to be found within the priory itself.

==16th-18th centuries==

On a visit to Colonsay in the 18th century, Sir Joseph Banks was informed that Murchardus Macdufie (d. 1539) &quot;was a factor or manager for Macdonald King of the Isles upon these islands of Oransay and Colonsay &amp; that for his mismanagement &amp; tyranny he was executed by order of that prince&quot;.

According to Caldwell (2011) &quot;the medieval period on Islay, Jura and Colonsay was a cultural high point&quot; but the last known Prior of Oronsay was Robert Lamont, elected in 1555. After the Scottish Reformation in 1560, the lands and property of the priory was given &quot;in commendam&quot; to &quot;Maol Choluim MacDubhthaich&quot; (Malcolm MacDuffie), at which time it would appear that the community ceased to exist. The MacDuffies based their operations at the site of the old Dalriadan fort of Dun Eibhinn.

Writing in 1549, Sir Donald Monro, High Dean of the Isles stated of &quot;Orvansay&quot; that it was a low-lying island with &quot;ane Monasterie of Channonis&quot; and &quot;full of hares and polecats, with a good anchorage for Highland galleys and shallow waters&quot;. In 1596 a report about the military strength of the Lords of the Isles indicated that Colonsay and Oronsay together maintained a contingent of 100 warriors who were not required to work the land.

By the early 17th century land on Colonsay was held by both Clan Macfie and Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg. In 1623 Coll Ciotach (Colkitto), a Dunnyveg mercenary, was charged with the murder of Malcolm MacFie. MacFie had been hiding on Eilean nan Ròn (an islet south-west of Oronsay) but he was spotted there by Colkitto&#x27;s men, apprehended and then tied to a stone and summarily shot. However, after the death of their chief, the MacFies lost control of their lands and by 1630 Colkitto held the whole of Colonsay and Oronsay from the Campbell Earl of Argyll. However, not long after this Colkitto lost his own life in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and by 1701 the Campbells had sold both islands to a MacNeill of Knapdale, whose family held these lands until the early 20th century.

Martin Martin observed in a 1703 publication that Oronsay:
The island is now owned by the Colburn family.

==Wildlife==
The rocks and skerries of Eilean nan Ròn (Seal Island), to the south-west, are an important grey seal breeding colony. The islet has a ruined house, possibly once used by a kelp gatherer and used for sheep grazing in the summer, the rocks being fertilised by the winter-visiting barnacle geese. Dean Munro also mentioned the nearby islet of Eilean Ghaoideamal under its earlier name of &quot;Ellan na muk&quot;, noting that it was &quot;gude for swine and uther bestiall&quot;.

In order to conserve the population of resident choughs and breeding corncrakes Oronsay and southern Colonsay became a Special Protection Area in December 2007.

Colonsay and Oronsay are home to about 50 colonies of the European dark bee the &quot;Apis mellifera mellifera&quot;. The Scottish Government introduced the Bee Keeping (Colonsay and Oronsay) Order 2013 to prevent cross breeding with other honeybees (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;) and to protect it from diseases common on the mainland. From 1 January 2014 it has been an offence to keep any other honeybee on either island. The Environment and climate Change Minister Paul Wheelhouse MSP said: &quot;The Bee Keeping Order illustrates how our non-native species legislation can be used to protect our native wildlife. The order is a targeted measure to protect an important population of black bees on Colonsay from hybridisation with non-native bees&quot; (the &quot;non-native species legislation&quot; was used because &quot;Apis mellifera&quot; are considered to be non-native to Colonsay, but considered native to Scotland as it was the first honey bee to be introduced for use in beekeeping there). The bees on Colonsay are now referred to as the &quot;Colonsay Dark Native Bee&quot;. They were collected from across Scotland in the previous thirty years, genetic analysis has shown Australian and New Zealand &quot;A. m. ligustica&quot; introgression.

<doc id="472315" wikidata="Q66710" url="?curid=472315" title="Daman and Diu">
<text>Daman and Diu (; ) was a union territory in northwestern India. With an area of , it was the smallest administrative subdivision of India on the mainland. The territory comprised two districts, Daman and Diu Island, geographically separated by the Gulf of Khambat. The state of Gujarat and the Arabian Sea bordered the territory. A Portuguese colony since the 1500s, these territories were taken over by India with the Annexation of Goa in 1961. Daman and Diu were administered as part of the union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu between 1961 and 1987. After the Goa Opinion Poll, they became separate union territories. In 2019, a legislation was passed to merge the union territories of Daman and Diu with its neighbouring union territory, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, to form the new union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu with effect from 26 January 2020.

== History ==
For over 450 years, the coastal enclaves of Daman (Portuguese: Damão) and Diu on the Arabian Sea coast were part of Portuguese India, along with Goa and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Goa, Daman and Diu were incorporated into the Republic of India on 19 December 1961, by a military conquest named Operation Vijay. Portugal did not recognise the Indian annexation of these territories until the Carnation Revolution of 1974. The territory has also been ruled by Kolis.

The territories of Goa, Daman and Diu were administered as a single union territory until 30 May 1987, when Goa was granted statehood, leaving Daman and Diu as a separate union territories. Each enclave constituted one of the union territory&#x27;s two districts. Daman and Diu are approximately 650 kilometres away from each other by road.

On 3 November 2019, Daman Collector Rakesh Minhas issued a Section 144 order banning peaceful assembly of four or more persons, slogan-shouting and the use of loudspeakers across the entire and ordered the conversion of Government High School, Bhimpore and the Government Sarvottam High School, Moti Daman into &#x27;temporary jails&#x27;. This was in response to a land ownership dispute between the local indigenous fishing community and the local administration that had confiscated their land and bulldozed their homes. The ensuing 2019 Daman Indigenous Land Clearing Protests resulted with the detention of 70 protesters in the &#x27;temporary jails&#x27; and another 8 arrests. Few of the adivasi fisherfolk were re-housed whilst most languished traumatised and homeless on the streets near the rubble of their razed homes.

In December 2019, the Parliament of India passed legislation to merge Daman and Diu with the nearby union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli to create a new union territory to be known as Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.

== Demographics ==

According to the 2011 census, Daman and Diu had a literacy rate of 87.1%, higher than the national average of 74.04%. Male and female literacy rates are 91.5 and 79.5 per cent respectively. The lowest female-to-male ratio in India (618 females per thousand males) was recorded in Daman and Diu. The Daman district, with a sex ratio of 533:1000 (F:M), is among the lowest of all the districts.

===Religion===
Hinduism was the most common religion in Daman and Diu. Muslims were also now the second-largest religious group in the territory, followed by the indigenous Christians. The Catholic Christians of Daman and Diu were pastorally served by the Metropolitan Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Goa and Daman, which has its see in Goa, the primatial see of India.

===Languages===
Gujarati was the mother tongue of most of the territory&#x27;s population, as they belong to the Gujarati-speaking Damaniya sub-caste. Along with Gujarati, Hindi and English were also widely used. Daman and Diu were once part of a combined union territory along with Goa (a Konkani-speaking region) before Goa became a state in 1987.

The use of Portuguese, which was the territory&#x27;s official language during the colonial period, was in decline and relegated to home use. It was also used as a liturgical language by the territory&#x27;s Catholics. Standard Portuguese existed in a post-creole continuum while Daman and Diu Portuguese was spoken by about 10,000–12,000 people in Daman.

The languages taught in schools in Daman and Diu under the three-language formula were:

*First language: Gujarati
*Second language: Hindi
*Third language: English

== Administration ==

<doc id="472321" wikidata="Q33268" url="?curid=472321" title="Bhojpuri language">
<text>Bhojpuri (IPA: ; Devanagari: , Kaithi: ) is an Indo-Aryan language native to the Bhojpur-Purvanchal region of India and the Terai region of Nepal. It is chiefly spoken in eastern Uttar Pradesh, western Bihar, and northwestern Jharkhand in India, as well as western Madhesh, eastern Lumbini. 

It is also a minority language in Fiji, Mauritius, Suriname and South Africa. Fiji Hindi, an official language of Fiji, is a dialect of Bhojpuri spoken by the Indo-Fijians. Caribbean Hindustani is spoken by the Indo-Caribbean people in Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. In Mauritius, it is a recognised by the government and taught in university as well. 

Bhojpuri language is listed as potentially vulnerable in the UNESCO World Atlas of Languages.

==Name==
The oldest presence of the word &quot;Bhojpuri&quot; is found as &quot;Bodjpooria&quot; in 1789 in the translator&#x27;s preface of a book titled &quot;A Translation of the Sëir Mutaqherin&quot;, which is a translation of a Persian book written in 1780 by Ghulam Hussain Khan. The paragraph in which reads:

The word &quot;Bhojpuri&quot; is derived from Bhojpur. After the conquest of Chero and Ujjainiya Rajputs in 12th century, who were the descendants of Raja Bhoj from Ujjain, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh captured Shahabad and named their capital Bhojpur (City of Raja Bhoj). The seat of their government was Bhojpur village which was near Dumraon in Buxar. Two villages named Chhotka Bhojpur and Barka Bhojpur still exist in Buxar, where the ruins of their Navratna Fortress can still be seen. Slowly the word &quot;Bhojpur&quot; became the synonyms of the Shahabad or Arrah region (Today&#x27;s Bhojpur district, Buxar, Kaimur and Rohtas) and the adjective &quot;Bhojpuri&quot; or &quot;Bhojpuriya&quot; extended to mean the language or people of Bhojpur and even beyond it. Apart from &quot;Bhojpuri&quot; in the Eastern UP and Western Bihar, there were other names also for the language and people, at different places, the Bhojpuriya in Mughal armies were used to called &quot;Buxariya.&quot; In Bengal, they called &quot;Paschhimas&quot; (Westerners) and Bhojpuri people also called them &quot;Deshwali&quot; or &quot;Khoṭṭa,&quot; in upper provinces like Oudh they called &quot;Purabiya.&quot; Besides these, &quot;Banarasi&quot;, &quot;Chhaprahiya&quot;, and &quot;Bangarahi&quot; has also used for the language and People. Rahul Sankrityayan has suggested two names for it i.e. &quot;Mallika&quot; or &quot;Malli&quot; (due to ancient tribe of Malla) and &quot;Kashiki&quot; (due to ancient Kashi). The Girmityas who were taken to British colonies called it simply &quot;Hindustani&quot; or &quot;Hindi&quot; and it became &quot;Fiji Hindi&quot; in Fiji and &quot;Caribbean Hindustani&quot; in the Caribbean region.

==History==
Bhojpuri is a descendant of Magadhi Prakrit which started taking shape during the reign of the Vardhana dynasty. Bāṇabhaṭṭa, in his Harshacharita has mentioned two poets named &quot;Isānchandra&quot; and &quot;Benibhārata&quot; who used to write in local language instead of Prakrit and Sanskrit.

=== Initial period (700–1100 A.D.) ===
The earliest form of Bhojpuri can be traced in the Siddha Sahitya and Charyapada as early as the 8th century A.D.&quot;.&quot; This period is also called as Siddha period.

=== 1100–1400 A.D. ===
Between the 11th and 14th centuries A.D., much Bhojpuri folklore such as Lorikayan, &quot;Sorathi Birjabh&quot;, Vijaymal, Gopichand, Raja Bharthari&quot;ar&quot; came into existence. Alongside these, the Nath Saint composed literature in Bhojpuri. In this period, the Bhojpuri language altered and its regional boundaries were established.

=== Period of saints (1400–1700 A.D.) ===
In this era, saints from different sects such as Kabir, Dharni Das, Kina Ram and Dariya Saheb used Bhojpuri as their language of discourse. In the same period Arabic and Persian words came into Bhojpuri. Folk songs are also said to have been composed in this era.

=== Early research period (1700–1900 A.D.) ===

In this period the British established themselves as the colonial power in India, and scholars from Britain conducted the first academic study of Bhojpuri. Bhojpuri folk literature was researched, and the Bhojpuri region was mapped for the first time. In this period Bhojpuri became an international language. Between 1838 and 1917 labourers from the Bhojpuri region were taken to British Colonies like Fiji, Mauritius, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and South Africa, as well as the Dutch colony of Suriname as plantation workers. Music genres based on Bhojpuri folk music such as Chutney music, Baithak Gana, Geet Gawanai and Lok Geet arose in those countries.

British scholars like Buchanan, Beames and George Abraham Grierson studied the language in details. Beames published the grammar of Bhojpuri for the first time in 1868. Grierson compiled and published the folksongs of Bhojpuri in 1884. He published the folklore of Bhojpuri and also made the dictionaries in Bhojpuri. He also conducted the Linguistic Survey of India.

=== Present period (1900–present) ===
In the 19th century, notable works like Devakshara Charita, Badmash Darpan were published. In the 20th century, Bhikhari Thakur contributed significantly to Bhojpuri literature and theatre with his notable plays like Bidesiya, Beti Bechwa, Gabarghichor and novels like &quot;Bindia&quot; and &quot;Phulsunghi&quot; were published. In 1962, the first Bhojpuri film, &quot;Ganga Maiyya Tohe Piyari Chadhaibo&quot; was released and became the founding stone of the Bhojpuri film industry.

Bhojpuri is listed as a potentially vulnerable language in the UNESCO world atlas of languages due to the influence of Hindi. Words like &quot;Bujhã&quot; are being replaced by Hindi words like &quot;Samjhã&quot;.

==Geographic distribution==
The Bhojpuri-speaking region covers the area of 73,000 square kilometres approximately in India and Nepal and borders the Awadhi-speaking region to the west, the Nepali-speaking region to the north, the Magahi and Bajjika-speaking regions to the east and the Chhattisgarhi and Bagheli-speaking regions to the south. In Nepal, Bhojpuri is a major language. There are a number of Bhojpuri-speaking Muslims that are part of the Muhajir community in Pakistan, as well as in Bangladesh, where they are referred to as Stranded Pakistanis due to them speaking Bhojpuri and Urdu as their native tongue and not Bengali as most Bangladeshis do. They migrated to Bangladesh there during the Partition of India when the area was part of East Pakistan, before gaining independence as Bangladesh.
Bhojpuri is spoken by descendants of indentured labourers brought in the 19th and early 20th centuries for work in plantations in British colonies. These Bhojpuri speakers live in Mauritius, Fiji, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, and other parts of the Caribbean.
== Classification ==

Bhojpuri is an Indo-European language and belongs to the Eastern Indo-Aryan group of the Indo-Aryan languages. The Magahi and Maithili languages of Eastern Indo-Aryan group are closest living relatives of Bhojpuri. Odia, Bengali and Assamese are also closely related. Bhojpuri along with Magahi and Maithili, are grouped together as the Bihari languages. Together with the other branches of Eastern Indo-Aryan, the Bihari languages are considered to be direct descendants of the Magadhi Prakrit.

Bhojpuri is classified as an Eastern Indo-Aryan Language because it has similar inflexion system to the other languages of the same family such as Bengali, Maithili and Odia. For example, the pronunciation of the vowel &quot;a&quot; is broad in Eastern Indo-Aryan languages, and sounds like &quot;o&quot; in Bengali, on moving westwards it becomes less broad but still can be differentiated from the sharp cut &quot;a&quot; in Middle Indo-Aryan. In Bhojpuri, the clear cut &quot;a&quot; and the drawled &quot;a,&quot; which sounds like &quot;aw&quot; in the word &quot;awl&quot; are present and the contrast between the two gives a different tone to the language. This drawled &quot;a&quot; is represented by Avagraha (ऽ), for instance, the word &quot;dekh&#x27;la&quot;, you see, is written as देेखऽलऽ. Other property of Eastern Indo Aryan languages is that the adjectives does not change with the noun. For instance, &quot;moṭā&quot; is the feminine form of &quot;moṭī&quot; in Hindi. However, as with Bebgali, in Bhojpuri, only &quot;moṭ&quot; is used. The past and future tense in Bhojpuri is formed in same way as other Eastern Indo-Aryan Languages, by adding a suffix stating from -l&quot;a&quot; and &quot;-ba&quot; respectively to the verb. Form example, &quot;I shall See&quot;, in Bengali is &quot;dekh-bo&quot; and in Bhojpuri is &quot;dekh-ab&quot;.

Some scholars has also divided the East Indo Aryan or &quot;Magadhan&quot; languages in to three sub-groups viz. Western, Central and Eastern. Bengali, Assamese, Odia belongs to Eastern Magadhan, Maithili and Magahi to Central and Bhojpuri to western. Bhojpuri is classified as Western Magadhan because it has some properties which are peculiar to itself and are not present in other Magadhan Languages. Some striking differences are:

*&quot;raürā&quot; or &quot;raüwā&quot; as an honorfic pronoun for second person along with the &quot;apne&quot; form is used Bhojpuri. &quot;apne&quot; form is their in other Magadhan Languages but &quot;raüwā&quot; is totally absent.
* Verb substantive in other Magadhan language is of &quot;-acch&quot; for but Bhojpuri has &quot;-baṭe&quot; and &quot;hawe&quot;.
* The simple present is made by Bhojpuri by adding a suffix starting from &quot;-la&quot; with the verb, but this is totally absent in the other languages of Magadhan group. Hence, &quot;he sees&quot;, is &quot;dēkhe-lā&quot; in Bhojpuri but in but &quot;dekhait-chhi&quot; in Maithili and &quot;dekhechhi&quot; in Bengali.

==Dialects==
Bhojpuri has several dialects: Southern Standard Bhojpuri, Northern Standard Bhojpuri, Western Standard Bhojpuri, and Nagpuria Bhojpuri.

Southern Standard Bhojpuri is prevalent in the Shahabad district (Buxar, Bhojpur, Rohtas, and Kaimur districts) and the Saran region (Saran, Siwan and Gopalganj districts) in Bihar, the eastern Azamgarh (Ballia and eastern Mau districts) and Varanasi (eastern part of Ghazipur district) regions in Uttar Pradesh, and in the Palamu division (Palamu and Garhwa districts) in Jharkhand. The dialect is also known as &quot;Kharwari&quot;.

Northern Bhojpuri is common in the western Tirhut division (east and west Champaran and in Muzaffarpur district) in Bihar, and Gorakhpur division (Deoria, Kushinagar, Gorakhpur, and Maharajganj districts) and Basti division (Basti, Sidharthanagar, and Sant Kabir Nagar districts) in Uttar Pradesh. It is also spoken in Nepal.

Western Bhojpuri is prevalent in the areas of Varanasi (Varanasi, Chandauli, Jaunpur, and the western part of Ghazipur district), Azamgarh (Azamgarh district, western part of Mau district) and Mirzapur (Mirzapur, Sant Ravidas Nagar and Sonbhadra districts) divisions in Uttar Pradesh. Banarasi is a local name for Bhojpuri, named after Banaras.

Nagpuria Bhojpuri is the southernmost popular dialect, found in the Chota Nagpur Plateau of Jharkhand, particularly parts of Palamu, South Chotanagpur and Kolhan divisions. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;Sadari&quot;.

A more specific classification recognises the dialects of Bhojpuri as Bhojpuri Domra, Madhesi, Musahari, Northern Standard Bhojpuri (Basti, Gorakhpuri, Sarawaria), Southern Standard Bhojpuri (Kharwari), Western Standard Bhojpuri (Benarsi, Purbi) and Nagpuriya Bhojpuri.

==Phonology==


Among the seven languages which are sociolinguistically often counted as Hindi dialects (Haryanvi, Braj, Awadhi, Bhojpuri, Bundeli, Bagheli, and Kannauji), Bhojpuri has the most allophonic variations in vowels.

Bhojpuri has 6 vowel phonemes and 10 vocoids. The higher vowels are relatively tense, and the lower vowels are relatively lax. The language has 31 consonant phonemes and 34 contoids (6 bilabial, 4 apico-dental, 5 apico-alveolar, 7 retroflex, 6 alveo-palatal, 5 dorso-velar, and 1 glottal). 

Linguist Robert L. Trammell published the phonology of Northern Standard Bhojpuri in 1971. According to him, the syllable system is peak type: every syllable has the vowel phoneme as the highest point of sonority. Codas may consist of one, two, or three consonants. Vowels occur as simple peaks or as peak nuclei in diphthongs. The intonation system involves 4 pitch levels and 3 terminal contours.

==Grammar==
According to George Abraham Grierson, the grammar of Bhojpuri is simpler than other languages of the same family. Nouns in Bhojpuri have three forms: short, long and redundant. The adjectives of nouns do not change with genders. Plurals are made by adding either the suffix &quot;-na&quot; or &quot;ni&quot; with the nouns or adding the multitudes such as &quot;sabh&quot; (all) or &quot;lōg&quot; (people).

Examples:
Except few instances the Verb forms of Bhojpuri depend only on the subject and the object has no effect on it. Unlike other Eastern Indo-Aryan languages, Bhojpuri has a different verb form for the present tense, which corresponds to the Future forms of Nepali. It is formed by adding the suffix &quot;-lā&quot; to the present subjunctive. Therefore, for the verb &quot;to see&quot; the Bhojpuri verb is &quot;dekhe&quot; and the present form is &quot;dhekhelā&quot;, which is peculiar to itself and is not found in other languages of the same family like Magahi (dekhaït haï), Maithili (dekhaït achi) and Bengali (dekhechī). The Verbs forms of second person singular (dekh&#x27;be; you will see) is considered vulgar in Bhojpuri, plural form () is used in general. When it is desired to show respect the first person singular form (; I will see) is used instead of second person plural (). To show plural number the suffix &quot;-sa&#x27;&quot; or &quot;-ja&quot; is also used with the 2nd and third person forms, thus &quot;dekhe-la&#x27;-sa&quot; is &quot;they see&quot;. The present perfect form is made by adding &quot;ha&#x27;&quot; to the past form. Thus, &quot;ham dekh&#x27;li&quot; (I saw) is the past from and its present perfect form is &quot;&quot; (I have seen). Past perfect in regular verbs are made by adding the suffix &quot;-al&quot; to the verb (dekh - dekhal), but in some cases it has irregular forms like &quot;kar (kail)&quot;, &quot;mar&quot; &quot;(mual)&quot; etc.

Numerals of Bhojpuri take the classifier &quot;gō&quot; and &quot;ṭhō&quot;, which emphasises the countability and totality both. To show inclusiveness and exclusiveness, Bhojpuri used the suffixes &quot;-o&quot; and &quot;-e&quot; as in &quot;ham āmo khāïb&quot; (I will eat mangoes too) verses &quot;ham āme khāïb&quot; (I will eat only mangoes). These suffixes can be added to any lexical category such as numerals, adjectives etc.

The auxiliaries in Bhojpuri are formed on five bases viz. &quot;ha&quot;, &quot;ho&quot;, &quot;hokh&quot;, &quot;bāṭ&quot;, &quot;rah&quot;. These also act as the Copula. The &quot;bāṭ&quot; form provides for the tenses and the &quot;hokh&quot; or &quot;ho&quot; form provides for the modes, where as &quot;rah&quot; is the past of other three.

==Writing system==

Bhojpuri was historically written in Kaithi script, but since 1894 Devanagari has served as the primary script. Kaithi has variants as the locality changes, the three classified varianta are Tirhuti, Magahi and Bhojpuri variants. The Bhojpuri variant is used for writing Bhojpuri. Kaithi is now rarely used for Bhojpuri.
Kaithi script was used for administrative purposes in the Mughal era for writing Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Maithili, Magahi, and Hindustani from at least the 16th century up to the first decade of the 20th century. Government gazetteers report that Kaithi was used in a few districts of Bihar throughout the 1960s. Bhojpuri residents of India who moved to British colonies in Africa, the Indian Ocean, and the Caribbean in the 19th and early 20th centuries used both Kaithi and Devanagari scripts.

By 1894 both Kaithi and Devanagari became common scripts to write official texts in Bihar. At present almost all Bhojpuri texts are written in Devanagari, even in islands outside of India where Bhojpuri is spoken. In Mauritius, Kaithi script was historically considered informal, and Devanagari was sometimes spelled as &quot;Devanagri&quot;. In modern Mauritius, the major script is Devanagari.

==Politeness==

Bhojpuri syntax and vocabulary reflects a three-tier system of politeness. Any verb can be conjugated through these tiers. The verb &quot;to come&quot; in Bhojpuri is &quot;aail&quot; and the verb &quot;to speak&quot; is &quot;bolal&quot;. The imperatives &quot;come!&quot; and &quot;speak!&quot; can be conjugated in five ways, each marking subtle variation in politeness and propriety. These permutations exclude a host of auxiliary verbs and expressions, which can be added to verbs to add another degree of subtle variation. For extremely polite or formal situations, the pronoun is generally omitted.


Similarly, adjectives are marked for politeness and formality. The adjective &quot;your&quot; has several forms with different tones of politeness: &quot;tum&quot; (casual and intimate), &quot;tōhār&quot; (polite and intimate), &quot;t&#x27;hār&quot; (formal yet intimate), &quot;rā&#x27;ur&quot; (polite and formal) and &quot;āpke&quot; (extremely formal). Although there are many tiers of politeness, Bhojpuri speakers mainly use the form &quot;tu&quot; to address a younger individual and &quot;raua&quot; for an individual who is older, or holds a higher position in workplace situations.

== Status ==
Greater official recognition of Bhojpuri, such as by inclusion in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India, has been demanded. In 2018, Bhojpuri was given second-language status in Jharkhand state of India.

Bhojpuri is taught in matriculation and at the higher secondary level in the Bihar School Education Board and the Board of High School and Intermediate Education Uttar Pradesh. It is also taught in various universities in India, such as Veer Kunwar Singh University, Banaras Hindu University, Nalanda Open University, and Dr. Shakuntala Misra National Rehabilitation University.

==Literature==


Lorikayan, the story of Veer Lorik contains Bhojpuri folklore from Eastern Uttar Pradesh. Bhikhari Thakur&#x27;s Bidesiya is a play, written as a book. &quot;Phool Daliya&quot; is a well-known book by Prasiddha Narayan Singh. It comprises poems of &quot;veer ras&quot; (A style of writing) on the theme of &quot;azaadi&quot; (&quot;Freedom&quot;) about his experiences in the Quit India movement and India&#x27;s struggle with poverty after the country gained independence.

Although Bhojpuri is not one of the established literary languages of India, it has a strong tradition of oral literature.

==Media==
The first journal to be published in Bhojpuri was Bagsar Samāchar which was published in 1915, but was closed in 1918. The first Bhojpuri weekly was published on 15 August 1947. Bhojpuri journalism rose massively in 1960s and 1970s, Bhojpuri Parivar (Patna), Bhojpuri Mandal (Motihari), Bhojpuri Samaj (Arrah) were some prominent journals of that time. Many Bhojpuri magazines and papers are published in Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh. Several Bhojpuri newspapers are available locally in northern India. &quot;Parichhan&quot; is a contemporary literary-cultural Maithili-Bhojpuri magazine, published by a Maithili-Bhojpuri academy and the government of Delhi, and edited by Parichay Das. &quot;The Sunday Indian, Bhojpuri&quot; is a regular national news magazine in Bhojpuri. &quot;Aakhar&quot; is a monthly online Bhojpuri literature magazine. Other media in Bhojpuri include &quot;Lok Lucknow&quot;, and the channels Mahuaa TV and Hamar TV. Bhojpuri Wikipedia was launched in 2003. On 22 May 2022, Google Translate added Bhojpuri as one of their languages.

==Vocabulary==
Bhojpuri vocabularies have similarity with other Indo Aryan languages and also have loanwords from Persian. Tiwari has classified the words of Bhojpuri in to 6 parts:

* Words of Sanskrit origin
* Words with untraceable origin
* Words borrowed from other Indo-Aryan Languages
* Sanskrit words either in original or modified form
* Words of non-Aryan Indian origin
* Foreign origin (Arabic, British etc.)

Words of Persian origin are roughly classified under the following head:

* Words pertaining to kingly states: amīr, kābū, hajūr
* Words relating to Revenue, Administration and Law: darogā, hak, huliyā
* Words relating to Islam: Allāh, tobā, mahjid
* Words of intellectual culture, music, education: ilīm, ijjat, munsi
* Words of material culture: kāgaj, kismis, sāl

Since Bengal has been one of the greatest centre for Bhojpuri-speaking people, Bhojpuri has taken a number of words from Bengali. It is also probable that words of European origin came to Bhojpuri through Bengali.

<doc id="472325" wikidata="Q540424" url="?curid=472325" title="Carolyn Leckie">
<text>Carolyn Leckie (born 5 March 1965) is a Scottish politician. She was a member of the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP), and held a number of senior positions in the party, but has since left the SSP. From 2003 to 2007 she was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Central Scotland region, having been elected on the SSP list.

== Biography ==
Leckie was born on 5 March 1965 and grew up in Glasgow, the daughter of a shipyard worker. She now lives in East Kilbride. Before she became an MSP she was a midwife and a local union leader who represented thousands of hospital workers in Glasgow.

==Campaigning==
Just before election to Holyrood, she led several successful strikes against low pay - the most recent involving 300 ancillary workers against the French multinational, Sodexho. As an MSP she was a strong supporter of the Nursery Nurses campaigning for higher pay. On 20 May 2004, after attempting to raise a point of order about the strike at a time that the Presiding Officer determined was inappropriate, she was told to leave the chamber. She was active within the parliament campaigning for an end to the cuts and closures in hospital services across Scotland.

On 20 January 2005, she was jailed for seven days for non-payment of a fine, arising from a protest outside Faslane nuclear base. The Nursing and Midwifery Council did not consider it an impediment to her registration as a Midwife. In January 2007, she was arrested but not charged for taking part in an anti-nuclear demonstration at Faslane as part of the Faslane 365 campaign.

In April 2014, Leckie led a campaign against plans to demolish the Red Road Flats during the 2014 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony.

==Other information==
Leckie was co-chair of the Scottish Socialist Party for several years. She stood down at the March 2006 annual conference, stating that it was time to hand the post over to a lay member of the party, but she was easily elected as an ordinary member of its executive committee.

She was one of several members who gave evidence in the &quot;Sheridan v News International&quot; defamation action, and the subsequent criminal trial &quot;HM Advocate v Sheridan and Sheridan&quot;. Former SSP leader Tommy Sheridan was found guilty of perjury and sentenced to three years in prison.

At the SSP conference in 2008, Leckie declined nomination for any national posts within the party, but remained an activist within the party, particularly within the Socialist Women&#x27;s Network. She drifted away from the party and stopped paying subscriptions without it being noticed.

Leckie is a founder member of Women for Independence campaign for Scottish independence.

Leckie worked for a Women&#x27;s Aid group from 2007 to 2014. She completed an LLB at the University of Strathclyde in 2014, continuing to work throughout. She has since gained a Diploma in Professional Legal Practice from the University of Dundee and is pursuing a law career. She has stated that she will not stand for election again.

<text>The A15 is a major road in England. It runs north from Peterborough via Market Deeping, Bourne, Sleaford and Lincoln along a variety of ancient, Roman, and Turnpike alignments before it is interrupted at its junction with the M180 near Scawby. The road restarts east, and then continues north past Barton-upon-Humber, crossing the Humber on the Humber Bridge before terminating at Hessle near Kingston upon Hull.

==Driving conditions==
According to the AA, the route is long and should take 2 hours. Norman Cross to Bourne takes 33 minutes, Bourne to Lincoln takes 46 minutes, and Lincoln to the Humber Bridge takes 54 minutes.

A section of the A15 (between Scampton and the M180) provides the longest stretch of straight road in the UK.

==Route==

===Peterborough===

The A15 is Peterborough&#x27;s main connecting road from the south to the A1(M), joining near Stilton, at Norman Cross. It begins as &quot;London Road&quot; at junction 16 of the A1(M) with the B1043 (former A1) in Cambridgeshire and the district of North West Cambridgeshire. From here to Yaxley, it passes the &quot;Norman Cross Hotel&quot; and follows the City of Peterborough and Cambridgeshire boundary, where there is a junction with the B1091 (for Farcet).

It enters the City of Peterborough near Hampton Vale on the left and meets the A1260 &quot;The Serpentine&quot;, which leads to two much faster routes around Peterborough. Next is a roundabout for the Cygnet Park business park on the left, home of the new headquarters of News International. It enters Old Fletton near the headquarters of Hotpoint to the left. A staggered junction with the A1129 crosses the East Coast Main Line. It passes Peterborough United on the right in New Fletton. It meets the start of the A605 at a roundabout and crosses the River Nene.
The A15 takes two routes through Peterborough:
* The route on the west side begins as &quot;Bourges Boulevard&quot; at Peterborough Combined Court Centre, meets the A1179 (former A47), passes the Peterborough railway station and meets three roundabouts near Millfield and New England. It follows the East Coast Main Line and becomes &quot;Lincoln Road&quot; and &quot;Werrington Parkway&quot; after the A47 GSJ. It passes four roundabouts, crossing the Peterborough to Lincoln Line.
* The route on the east side starts at the &quot;Eye&quot; roundabout with the A1139 at Newark, then follows the dual-carriageway &quot;Paston Parkway&quot;, which meets the A47. It continues as a dual-carriageway (opened in spring 2008) at the next roundabout at Gunthorpe. It follows the Car Dyke and then meets another roundabout at Werrington before becoming a single-carriageway and crossing the Spalding railway between Werrington and Glinton.
Both routes head through Werrington (passing either side) before joining again at Glinton with the roundabout with the B1443. There is another roundabout. with the B1443 (for Helpston). It passes Etton. It meets a roundabout with the B1524 (the former route through Market Deeping), B1162 (for Northborough to the right) and an exit for Maxey to the right.

===Kesteven===
Just south of the &quot;Welland Gate&quot; roundabout on the A1175 and B1166, it crosses the River Welland so entering South Kesteven in Lincolnshire. The roundabout marks the western end of the £7 million Market Deeping bypass, finished in July 1998. The A15 and A1175 roads are now merged in a dual-carriageway stretch. It meets the B1524 (former route) at a roundabout and heads to the left as &quot;Peterborough Road&quot; &quot;Bourne Road&quot; and &quot;Deeping Road&quot;.
North of Baston is the Waterside Garden Centre close to where it meets the north-south Roman Road King Street, which it follows until just north of Bourne. It goes over the River Glen at the point it is crossed by the Macmillan Way, at Kate&#x27;s Bridge.

There is a left turn for Obthorpe and it goes through Thurlby, passing the &quot;Horseshoe&quot; pub, then Northorpe, before coming to the small town of Bourne. It meets the recently diverted A151 at a new roundabout (the A151 leaves to the right further on), where the road becomes &quot;South Road&quot;. It passes Bourne Grammar School, then after some treacherous bends near Bourne Abbey becomes &quot;South Street&quot;, with the town&#x27;s Heritage centre and war memorial gardens on the left by the Bourne Eau. At the crossroads in the centre of town it crosses the B1193 (original route of the A151) in the historic market place(), where are located the &quot;Nags Head&quot;, &quot;Angel Hotel&quot;, &quot;Burghley Arms&quot;. As &quot;North Street&quot;, it passes the Burghley Centre (shops), and Bourne Bus Station. At the two miniature roundabouts, the name changes to North Road, which it keeps until it reaches Morton.
Just outside Bourne, at , the route of (Roman) King Street heads off across the fields to Stainfield and Ancaster but the A15 continues north along the line of another Roman road, Mareham Lane. It passes close to Dyke, and goes through Morton as &quot;Bourne Road&quot;, passing the &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; pub. It becomes &quot;Folkingham Road&quot; there is a right turn for Haconby and a junction with the B1177 (for Billingborough). Close by are Rippingale and Kirkby Underwood. Between Rippingale and Aslackby, a wooded lay-by known locally as &#x27;Turnpike Bar&#x27; marks the deviation from the line of the Roman Road Mareham Lane. The A15 passes by Aslackby and the &quot;Robin Hood and Little John&quot;, and then through the middle of Folkingham.
There is the Threekingham Bar roundabout with the east-west A52, and it goes through Osbournby, as &quot;London Road&quot; the primary school]. It passes the &quot;Tally Ho Inn&quot; near Aswarby, then there are left turns for Aunsby and Swarby. Sleaford and Silk Willoughby were on the A15, which slowed traffic down as the traffic went across a level crossing and through Sleaford&#x27;s shopping area. The £5.7 million bypass was opened on 16 September 1993 by Douglas Hogg, where there is a roundabout with the A153 and B1517. The A15 crosses the railway and River Slea, and then leaves the bypass at the &quot;Holdingham Roundabout&quot; with the A17 and B1518 (former route).
As &quot;Lincoln Road&quot;, it goes close to Leasingham meeting the B1209. There is a junction Cranwell with the B1429. It meets the B1191 (for Scopwick), B1202 (for Boothby Graffoe to the west and Metheringham to the east) next to the former RAF Coleby Grange, and B1178 (for Harmston), where it passes Dunston Pillar. At Nocton Heath, it passes the &quot;Kitchen&quot; cafe. On the route to Lincoln, it goes near to two RAF bases – RAF Digby, which is used for communications rather than as a flying station, and across the end of the runway of RAF Waddington, which flies AWACS and Nimrod aircraft. A parking place and cafe are provided for plane spotters on the eastern side of the road.
Next to the runway at Waddington is an old Vulcan, carrying the number of the plane that bombed Port Stanley.

South of Bracebridge Heath, the A15 heads east around the city using the A15 Lincoln Eastern Bypass, a single carriageway opened on 19 December 2020. The route is designed to allow for easy widening to a dual carriageway if necessary in the future. The bypass has three roundabouts, two bridges, and one underpass before reaching the River Witham. The road crosses over the river on a viaduct before entering Lincoln for a short distance before entering Lindsey.

===Lindsey===


The bypass continues north, entering West Lindsey, before meeting the Greetwell Road roundabout and then terminating at the Wragby Road roundabout. The A15 then runs unbroken northwestwards to the &quot;Riseholme&quot; roundabout, where it briefly re-enters the City of Lincoln, then follows the Roman road Ermine Street past the Riseholme College of Agriculture on the right, now part of the University of Lincoln, and Lincolnshire Showground to the left. At the end of a section is the &quot;Tillbridge Lane&quot; roundabout with the A1500, for Gainsborough. From here, it used to be straight, but with RAF Scampton becoming a base for Avro Vulcan V bombers in the 1950s, the runway had to be extended, and the road now has a curved diversion to the east. The Scampton diversion began on 20 June 1956, to be finished in early 1957; construction was started by Councillor W.  H. Mackinder of Lindsey County Council; the diversion was opened at noon on Monday 28 January 1957, being built by Laing. The formerly straight line still forms the border of many strip parishes in the area, such as between Scampton and Welton, whose borders were first put in place based on Ermine Street. It passes the Scampton primary school and continues past a right turn to Normanby by Spital, on its most straight section, also the parish boundary of many local villages. At the roundabout with the A631 at Caenby Corner, there is the Total &quot;Caenby Corner Garage&quot; just south of Spital-in-the-Street. Overtaking is difficult as the road, although straight, is undulating with unmarked dips and slow-moving farm traffic. There are two right turns for Bishop Norton and Atterby. There is a right turn for Snitterby and a left turn for Blyborough. At the B1205 staggered crossroads (for Waddingham to the east, and Grayingham to the west), it enters North Lincolnshire.


At the B1206 crossroads, the old route used to go through Hibaldstow and Brigg, with the former road to Redbourne now a cycle route. It passes close to Kirton in Lindsey, home of RAF Kirton in Lindsey much used in the Second World War as a fighter airfield in 12 Group, now home to the Trent Valley Gliding Club. Hibaldstow was a wartime fighter airfield as well, and this is now used as a base for parachuting and parachuting competitions by Target Skysports. The £7 million Brigg and Redbourne bypass was added in December 1989 which follows the old Ermine Street in North Lincolnshire further than previously, with a much flatter, wider and safer road. This section was the upgraded route of an unclassified road. It crosses the Sheffield to Cleethorpes railway line near the deserted village of Gainsthorpe, passes near to Scawby, and joining the M180 at junction 4, near Scunthorpe. It abandons the Roman alignments at a short spur to the A18 at the &quot;Briggate Lodge Roundabout&quot; next to the Forest Pines golf club and hotel at Broughton. Ermine Street continues north as the B1207, meeting the Humber near Winteringham.

The route of the A15 now becomes part of the three-laned M180, which was opened on 2 September 1977. The A15 section along Ermine Street was planned to be opened simultaneously, but it had to wait twelve years. Traffic buildup to Grimsby prompted calls for the Brigg bypass for many years, but the Flixborough explosion of 1974 made it more of an emergency. This section goes under the A18, over the River Ancholme, over the old route of the A15 (B1206), and over the South Trans-Pennine railway. At junction 5, the A15 reforms at the dual-grade &quot;Barnetby Top Interchange&quot;, which is crossed by the Viking Way and has an exit to Elsham. It continues north as a dual carriageway, which carries about as little traffic as the M180. The M180 drops to two lanes under this roundabout and continues to Grimsby and Immingham as the A180.

The A15 towards the Humber Bridge, goes directly across the runways of the former RAF Bomber Command airfield at RAF Elsham Wolds (where over 1,000 of its aircrew were killed), which is now the Elsham Wolds Industrial Estate. The former route of the A15, pre-1978, is now called B1206, and ends at New Holland, where the A15 formerly connected with the Humber Ferry. The £5.6 million Brigg Bypass to Barton-upon-Humber Bypass (up to where the B1218 crosses) section opened in June 1978.

The £2 million Barton-upon-Humber Bypass to Humber Bridge (A1077 interchange) section opened in September 1978, although some maps show this being open before the southern section to the M180. When this section opened to the GSJ with the A1077 (for South Ferriby) in 1978, there was no longer any access to the B1218. In the early 1990s, a new interchange was added with the B1206 (the former A15), which is crossed by the Viking Way, which follows the road for over a mile. The section across the Humber was opened on 17 July 1981, by the Queen, and was the world&#x27;s longest single-span bridge until 1997. The tolls are north of the bridge. It crosses the A63 and meets a roundabout with A164 (for Beverley) and A1105, then turns left along a short section of dual-carriageway (former A63) to end at the A63.

<text>Rosemary &quot;Rosie&quot; Kane (&quot;née&quot; McGarvey; born 5 June 1961) is a Scottish Socialist Party politician. She was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Glasgow Region from 2003 to 2007.

==Political history==

===Introduction to politics===
Kane entered politics after becoming involved in a campaign against the extension of the M77 motorway. In 1996 she was the first ever candidate of the newly formed Scottish Socialist Alliance when she contested a Glasgow City Council by-election in the Toryglen ward, an area threatened by the M74 extension plan, and came third with 18% of the vote. After this she was an election candidate a number of times for the Scottish Socialist Alliance and its successor the Scottish Socialist Party. She served on the National Executive committee of the party for a number of years and as the party&#x27;s environmental spokesperson, writing a column &quot;One World&quot; for the &quot;Scottish Socialist Voice&quot;.

===Parliamentary work (2003–2007)===
Kane stood for election to the Scottish Parliament in 2003, and was placed second on the party&#x27;s list in Glasgow region. She was elected alongside Tommy Sheridan, who was first on the list. In her victory speech, she stated how she planned to shake up the Parliament, stating &quot;They&#x27;re going to be amazed at all the madness and craziness that&#x27;s going to happen in there&quot;.

MSPs are required to swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen before they can take their seat in Parliament. As the Scottish Socialist Party is a republican party, their MSPs held various protests during the oath ceremony, during which Kane took her oath with her hand raised which had the words &quot;My oath is to the people&quot; written on it.

On 6 November 2003, Kane appeared on &quot;Question Time&quot; alongside the SNP&#x27;s Alex Salmond, Labour MSP Cathy Jamieson, Tory MP Francis Maude and Peter Oborne of &quot;The Spectator&quot;. Host David Dimbleby referred to her contribution as &quot;eloquent and intriguing&quot;. According to the &quot;Scottish Socialist Voice&quot;, Kane faced accusations from the audience that the SSP were slow to condemn Palestinian suicide bombers she responded by saying she &quot;condemned all attacks on innocent people, emphasising Israel&#x27;s fault regarding non-negotiations in the on-going conflict&quot;.

In late 2003, she announced that she was taking a short break from politics to deal with clinical depression. She returned to work early in 2004.

In 2005, Kane accepted an invitation to meet Fidel Castro at a conference in Cuba. Later in 2005, she took part in an anti-nuclear protest, locking herself to a model of a nuclear submarine outside the Scottish Parliament building. She was fined £150 for the demonstration, and was imprisoned in Cornton Vale for 14 days in October 2006 after refusing to pay. In January 2007, she was arrested but not charged for taking part in a peaceful anti-nuclear demonstration at Faslane, as part of the Faslane 365 campaign.

In June 2005, along with fellow socialist MSPs Carolyn Leckie, Frances Curran, and Colin Fox, she was suspended from the Scottish Parliament for the month of September for disrupting parliamentary proceedings in a peaceful protest in the chamber. They were highlighting the issue of the right to protest outside the Gleneagles Hotel, the site of the 31st G8 summit.

During her time in parliament, she also campaigned against the treatment of toxic waste in South East Glasgow, against water fluoridation and against GM crops. She remains active in the fight to end the detention of children at Dungavel asylum detention centre, as well as campaigns for migrants rights and against dawn raids. She personally paid the bail for a Cameroonian woman called Mercy Ikolo and her Ireland-born 18-month-old baby to allow them to leave the centre, inviting them to stay with her and her daughters in their tenement flat until their visa issues were resolved.

===After leaving parliament===
Kane stood as the no. 1 candidate for her party on the Glasgow regional list for the 2007 Scottish Parliament election. The SSP polled 2,579 votes in the Glasgow region and failed to re-elect any candidates. Since September 2012, Kane has been involved in the Women for Independence campaign for Scottish independence. In April 2015, she organised a vigil in George Square in Glasgow in relation to the killing of Karen Buckley.

==Other information==
Kane is a member of the Industrial Workers of the World (Wobblies) and became a grandmother in February 2011.

In 2011, Kane played the role of a mother in a play written by future SSP co-spokesperson Sandra Webster as part of the National Theatre of Scotland&#x27;s Five Minute Theatre project. The play was inspired by Sandra&#x27;s experience of bringing up her two autistic sons. She also appeared in &quot;An Evening with Rosie Kane&quot; in May 2012 and played herself in &quot;I, Tommy&quot; in September 2013.

<text>Rosemary Byrne (born 3 March 1948, Irvine, North Ayrshire) is a Scottish politician who served as co-convenor of Solidarity from 2006 to 2019.

Byrne was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the South of Scotland region from 2003 to 2007. She was elected as a Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) MSP but in September 2006, together with Tommy Sheridan, she left that party to form Solidarity.

Byrne lives in Irvine, and was a teacher and a trade union activist for several years. At one time she was president of Irvine Trades Council.

==Political career==
She stood unsuccessfully in the 2001 United Kingdom general election as the Scottish Socialist Party candidate for Cunninghame South (UK Parliament constituency).

In the 2003 Scottish Parliament election Byrne stood as the Scottish Socialist Party candidate for the Cunninghame South constituency to the Scottish Parliament, where she received 2,677 votes and came third. She was elected to a regional seat from the SSP&#x27;s list.

The SSP returned six MSPs at the 2003 election. Byrne was the only one of the six who was not already a member of the SSP executive, she was arguably the least prominent. She was elected to the executive in early 2004, and at the February 2005 conference she was elected as one of the SSP&#x27;s co-chairs. However she did not stand for re-election to this post or the executive committee at its conference in March 2006, stating that she was standing down for personal reasons.

On 3 September Sheridan and Byrne launched a new political party, naming it Solidarity – Scotland&#x27;s Socialist Movement.

==Sheridan vs. News International==

There was a controversial defamation case in 2006 between fellow SSP MSP Tommy Sheridan and the British tabloid newspaper &quot;The News Of The World&quot;, Sheridan v News International. Following this, Sheridan and Byrne split from the SSP, and formed a new socialist party which they named &quot;Solidarity&quot;.

During the trial, in which Sheridan sued the &quot;News of the World&quot; for defamation and won, Byrne gave evidence supporting Sheridan. On 1 October 2006 the News of the World published fresh evidence which it claimed proved that their allegations were true and Sheridan had thus lied to the Court of Session during the trial. Sheridan was subsequently charged with and eventually convicted of perjury.

Both Byrne and Sheridan were accused by the IWW of betraying workers by unilaterally removing funding from the collective body which employed parliamentary staff.

On 15 February 2008, Byrne was arrested on suspicion of perjury in relation to the Sheridan defamation trial. However, the Crown Office said that the matter would not be taken further at the conclusion of the subsequent criminal trial.

In June 2016, Sheridan resigned from his position as co-convener of the Solidarity, with councillor Pat Lee elected to replace him alongside Byrne.

<text>Jacek Józef Dukaj (: ; born 30 July 1974) is a Polish science fiction and fantasy writer. His fiction explores such themes as alternate history, alternative physics and logic, human nature, religion, the relationship between science and power, technological singularity, artificial intelligence, and transhumanism. He is regarded among the most popular Polish contemporary science fiction authors. 

He is the recipient of numerous national and international literary prizes including the European Union Prize for Literature, Janusz A. Zajdel Award and European Science Fiction Award.

==Career==
He was born on 30 July 1974 in Tarnów. He graduated from High School No. 3 in Tarnów and subsequently studied philosophy at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. He made his literary debut at the age of 16 when he published his short story &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Golden Galley&quot;) in the &quot;Fantastyka&quot; science-fiction monthly. In 1997, he published his first novel &quot;Xavras Wyżryn&quot;. His texts and short stories were featured in such science fiction and fantasy magazines as &quot;Nowa Fantastyka&quot;, &quot;Sfinks&quot;, &quot;Framzet&quot;, &quot;Fantom&quot;, &quot;Fenix&quot;, &quot;Science Fiction&quot; and &quot;Czas Fantastyki&quot;.

His short stories have been translated into English, German, Russian, Czech, Slovak, Macedonian, Italian, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Ukrainian and Bosnian. His first story, &quot;The Golden Galley&quot;, was translated into English by Wiesiek Powaga and published in &quot;The Dedalus Book of Polish Fantasy&quot;. Michael Kandel&#x27;s translation of &quot;The Iron General&quot; has been published in &quot;A Polish Book of Monsters&quot; and his translation of fragments of &quot;The Cathedral&quot; into English is available online. &quot;The Cathedral&quot; served as the basis for the 2002 Academy Award-nominated science-fiction short film of the same name directed by Tomasz Bagiński.

In 2007, he published one of the most successful of his novels entitled &quot;Ice&quot; for which he won the Janusz A. Zajdel Award, European Union Prize for Literature and Kościelski Award. In 2009, he published &quot;Wroniec&quot; whose action takes place in the background of the 1981 martial law in Poland.

&quot;The Apocrypha of Lem&quot;, a mock-review in Lem&#x27;s tradition, written as an afterword for reedition of Lem&#x27;s &quot;A Perfect Vacuum&quot;, was published in &quot;Lemistry&quot;, translated by Danuta Stok. &quot;The Old Axolotl&quot; is the first book of Dukaj published in English (in 2015). The novel inspired a 2020 Netflix-original Belgian TV series &quot;Into the Night&quot;. In 2017, English language rights to &quot;Ice&quot; were acquired by London-based publisher Head of Zeus. The publication date will be announced once the novel is translated.

As of 2021, Jacek Dukaj is also involved in business, being main shareholder and CEO of Nolensum company, founded to produce video games based on his stories and original ideas, as well as shareholder and member of Board of Directors of Bellwether Rocks, an investment fund with focus on gamedev industry and tokenization, NFTs, crypto etc.

In 2023, he was awarded the European Science Fiction Award conferred by the European Science Fiction Society (ESFS) in the Best Author category.

==Style and themes==
His works frequently feature elements of cyberpunk, alternative history, and horror stories. He was an early representative of klerykal fiction, a subgenre of Polish fantasy and science fiction characterized by the use of religious themes, which remains one of the most distinctive features of Dukaj&#x27;s novels. They were already present in &quot;The Golden Galley&quot;, his literary debut. The author is also known for undertaking literary experiments manifesting themselves in the combination of elements of fantasy with science fiction as is the case with &quot;The Iron General&quot; (2015).

Dukaj has stated that creating a cohesive vision of the universe in a particular work is the basis of any good fantasy or science fiction book. Hence his books scrupulously describe the scientific aspects governing this universe and make use of elaborate scientific terminology. The realism in presenting the boundaries of human understanding might be inspired by the works of Stanisław Lem, which introduce the theme of the wear and tear of future inventions. The secret relationship between science and power is also explored in Dukaj&#x27;s works, most notably in &quot;Black Oceans&quot; (2001), which is reminiscent of Lem&#x27;s &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; (1968).

<doc id="472341" wikidata="Q2063916" url="?curid=472341" title="A21 road (England)">
<text>The A21 is a trunk road in Southern England, one of several which connect London and various commuter towns to the south coast. It provides a link to Hastings, East Sussex and parts of Kent. Half of the distance covered is over gently undulating terrain, with some hills and bends. Traffic is often is slow-moving, particularly on weekdays on the short single carriageway stretches; and in summer with holiday traffic.
Because of this, people have described the A21 as &quot;a joke&quot; and businesspeople have been reported to &quot;hate coming down the A21&quot;. There have been many proposals to upgrade parts of the A21 in response to this.

Parts of the A21 follow the historic turnpike roads: for example the section from Sevenoaks to Tunbridge Wells, opened in 1710; other sections of the road were similarly dealt with later in the century. It is also the location of the first wildlife overbridge in the United Kingdom, near Lamberhurst.
The road between the M25 and Hastings is designated a trunk road, and is maintained and managed by National Highways.

The A21 is used for the Maydayrun to Hastings in which motorcyclists ride from south London to the Hastings seafront. It claims to be the largest non-organised event in the UK, attracting over 20,000 bikers.

==History==

===Turnpikes===
Parts of the A21 follow the turnpike roads: one being the section from Sevenoaks to Tunbridge Wells, opened in 1710; other sections of the road were similarly dealt with later in the century.

===A2100 road===
South of Johns Cross, the A21 originally followed the present day A2100 road passing Mountfield and heading through Battle and approaching Silverhill via Hollington. The A21 was later rerouted to the east along what was formerly the B2091, A229 and A28.

===Upgraded dual-carriageway sections===
Sections of the A21 were upgraded to a dual carriageway standard in stages in the 20th century. 

====Sevenoaks Bypass====
The Sevenoaks Bypass opened in 1966. 

====Tonbridge Bypass====
It wasfollowed by the Tonbridge bypass and associated Medway Valley viaduct in July 1971. 

====Pembury Bypass====
The Pembury bypass opened in 1988, followed by the Robertsbridge bypass in 1989.

====Lamberhurst Bypass====

The Lamberhurst Bypass was opened on 23 March 2005 to a cost of £18 million. The A21 used to have steep inclines into the village and the valley of the River Bewl. Included in the scheme is Britain&#x27;s first land bridge at Scotney Castle which facilitates safe migration of wild animals over the road. The scheme was constructed by May Gurney who planted 50,000 trees on the new road.

===Tonbridge and Pembury Bypass separation road width===
Between 1988 and 2017, the Tonbridge bypass and the Pembury bypass were separated by a section of 7.3 m wide single carriageway with no footways or verges. Severe congestion was frequent as this stretch carried an average of 35,000 vehicles each day, significantly higher than its original capacity, and the number of accidents occurring on this road was above the national average. There were proposals to upgrade this section of A21 to a dual carriageway standard following the Pembury bypasses completion, however they were delayed multiple times. In the 2000s, an upgrade scheme was proposed by the Highways Agency, and in 2013 it underwent public enquiry. The scheme layout followed the existing carriageway and involved the construction of a pedestrian and cycle route along its whole length, as well as upgrading the Longfield Road roundabout into a grade-separated Roundabout interchange. £92million of government money was made available to the scheme in July 2013. Preparatory works started in September 2014, which involved nine hectares of ancient woodland being removed. Trees and shrubs were relocated to adjacent land and nesting boxes were installed to protect endangered species such as the dormouse. 
As a result of the widening of the carriageway a number of buildings were demolished, including a Grade 2 listed 18th century barn. Completion of the scheme was delayed in late 2016 after the discovery of asbestos contamination. The improved road opened in September 2017.

==Modern route==

===Overview===
The A21 begins in Lewisham, about southeast of the centre of London. Passing through Catford, Bromley and Farnborough, 20 miles (32 km) from the start of the journey, it reaches the Kent border and the open countryside. Shortly afterwards the M25 is reached, with which it multiplexes for about . At this point, the road becomes a trunk road, a distinction it has held since April 1977. The continuation through Kent heads south east for around . This section is mostly a dual carriageway; but there are a few short stretches of single carriageway, resulting in frequent congestion, especially in peak periods.
Beyond the East Sussex border, the road is entirely single carriageway, sometimes with steep gradients.
Another bypass takes the A21 around the narrow road through Salehurst and Robertsbridge. Immediately before Hastings is the final hill, almost 4 miles (6 km) in length.

===London===

The A21 starts in Lewisham in London at a junction with the A20 known as &quot;Loampit Vale Junction&quot;. From there the road uses various roads in Catford, where the A205 (the South Circular Road) crosses the A21; it runs south east up &quot;Bromley Hill&quot; to enter the London Borough of Bromley, where there are sections of dual carriageway, on the town&#x27;s gyratory system (part of which is called &quot;Kentish Way&quot;) .

Up &quot;Masons Hill&quot; the road reaches Bromley Common, the first large-scale open space negotiated; briefly, just before Farnborough, the road becomes &quot;Hastings Road&quot;. The original A21 went through the suburb, the High Street is now the B2158. Until now the road has been in a south-easterly direction, but after Green Street Green it turns eastwards towards the valley of the River Darent, and it is at this point that the road pattern makes a complete change from its original route.


The A21 originally entered Kent here and climbed to the scarp of the North Downs at Polhill, and then descended through Dunton Green and up the valley of the River Darent to Sevenoaks; through the town centre and then down into the Medway valley via Hildenborough to Tonbridge. The &quot;London Road&quot; at the north of the town is now the B245; it continued through the long High Street, over the many bridges of the river (during which time it was also part of the A26 from Maidstone ). As the road began to climb out of the valley it took a left fork; shortly after this the route of the modern A21 is rejoined.

===Knockholt to Castle Hill===
Where the new A21 begins, and also where the A224 joins from the north, the road is called the &quot;Sevenoaks Road&quot;; at Knockholt (&quot;Hewitts Roundabout&quot;), the road enters Kent near its junction with a spur from the M25 motorway. The A21 actually multiplexes with the M25 and descends the North Downs Scarp here. The M25 then has to use a slip road in the left lane and the A21 takes priority although is still technically a motorway until the junction with the A25 to Sevenoaks and the M26. The oddness of Junction 5 is due to the M26 once being part of the M25.
Before the M25 was built, the A21 was the modern A224 near Polhill and then became the dual carriageway &quot;Sevenoaks bypass&quot;.

This section of the road is a grade separated dual carriageway with two lanes in each direction (aside from a three lane section northbound climbing Hubbards Hill). The road passes to the west of the town, running through a nearby valley until it meets the A225 and B245 at Morley&#x27;s Interchange near Sevenoaks Weald. The next section bypasses the original route of the A21 along the B245 through Hildenborough, Tonbridge High Street, and Pembury Road to join the current route near the second A26 junction.

Between Leigh and Haysden the road crosses the River Medway by means of a two-span viaduct. Around this point, the road enters the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The A21 then meets the two junctions with the A26, providing access to Tonbridge and Southborough.

===Castle Hill to Lamberhurst===
After the end of the Tonbridge bypass, the A21 climbs Castle Hill as the &quot;Pembury Bypass&quot; as it reaches the North Farm interchange with the flyover for non-stop traffic. The next junction is with the A264 road to Tunbridge Wells and the A228 to Maidstone. The road later meets the original alignment at an at-grade junction (leaving a brief gap in the central reservation) not long before it meets a double roundabout at &quot;Kippings Cross&quot; where another section of single carriageway starts.
The next section of A21 is a major bottleneck, being a single carriageway with frequent bends. In October 2005 the &quot;Preferred Route&quot; to upgrade this section was announced.
However, the scheme has since been suspended.

===Lamberhurst to John&#x27;s Cross===

After a junction with the A262, the road returns to a dual carriageway standard along the Lamberhurst bypass where the A21 skirts to the east of the village on a road through various farms until eventually it gets to Scotney Castle where the dual carriageway ends at a roundabout.

The next section of road is a single carriageway which travels past Bewl Water and Kilndown until it once again becomes a dual carriageway for . However it has been reduced to one lane in each direction to reduce speeding.
As the dual Carriageway ends, the road enters East Sussex and meets the A268, taking traffic to/from Rye. The A21 then travels through numerous conjoined villages including Hurst Green where it meets the A265 from Heathfield. After a hill descent, the road reaches a roundabout where the Robertsbridge bypass begins, taking traffic away from the main street in the village.
This is built to a single carriageway standard. The road then regains the original route before meeting the A2100 at a roundabout in the hamlet of Johns Cross.

===Mountfield to Hastings===
After Johns Cross roundabout, the A21 takes a relatively straight, though undulating, journey, through Whatlington and passes Sedlescombe before climbing a four-mile (6.4 km) long hill to enter Hastings where the first junction reached is the Baldslow Interchange where currently the A28, A2100 and B2093 roads all terminate. The A21 then heads through northern Hastings where the road is known as &quot;Sedlescombe road North&quot; with access to sub-urban streets until eventually it meets the A2101 which heads for the Town Centre. The A21 then enters Silverhill where it gets to a junction which is sometimes a major bottleneck. Afterwards the A2102 heads for St Leonards and the A21 becomes the high street of Bohemia where the road is narrow. The route then heads down with access to various emergency services and then enters the town centre. From here the original A21 cut through the town centre to meet the A259 at a roundabout near Pelham Crescent however since the town centre has been pedestrianised the A21 heads down on the sub-urban streets to the east. The next section of the A21 heads around partly on a one-way system near the railway station and the Priory Quarter business development. From here, the southbound stretch of A21 is reserved for buses only and terminates on the A259.

==Junctions==












==Improvement proposals==
Large portions of the A21, through Kent mostly, are dual carriageway with intervening stretches of single carriageway.
There have long been plans are to upgrade some of the remaining stretches of single carriageway to alleviate congestion, safety and accessibility problems in the villages along the route.

Safety is a particular concern because a 2002 report stated that a section of the A21 south of Flimwell was the most dangerous road in the south east outside London, and the 38th most dangerous in the country, however it has since been overtaken by the A259 between Pevensey and Bexhill-on-Sea.

===Kippings Cross to Lamberhurst===
When the Pembury bypass ends at &quot;Kippings Cross&quot;, the next section of A21 is a low quality single carriageway road with several steep gradients across the Weald. There are few major centres of habitation on the road
and limited or no footpaths.
There are many houses next to the route and the road has very frequent bends.
The Kippings Cross to Lamberhurst section has a high accident rate and congestion occurs particularly at peak times.

It is proposed that this section should be turned into a two-lane dual carriageway with footpaths
and is proposed to be completely off-line, although mainly following the existing route, and have
improvements to the A262 roundabout.
The Bypass is said to cost £40 million.

This scheme has since been suspended following the 2010 spending review.

===Flimwell to Robertsbridge===
Plans have been published for a new road between the southern end of the Flimwell bypass and the beginning of the Robertsbridge bypass. The 5.5-mile (8.9 km) improvement will bypass the villages of Flimwell, Hurst Green and Silver Hill. The improvement will commence at the B2079 junction (Lady Oak Lane) on the short section of existing dual carriageway north of Flimwell and terminate at the roundabout at the northern end of the Robertsbridge Bypass.
Although part of the road will be brought up to a dual carriageway standard, parts will become a &quot;wide single carriageway&quot;. This scheme has been postponed until 2015 at the earliest and currently route protection is being lifted.

===Baldslow Interchange===
Since the Hastings-Bexhill Link Road opened, more traffic has started to use the already congested road from the A2100/A28 to the A21 at Baldslow Interchange, Hastings.
Construction is underway to build a short link road to the A21 south of the interchange and bring more of the A21, from there up past to a new roundabout in an area north of the interchange, to dual carriageway standard.
Another option was to realign the A2100 north of the junction, but this option was less favourable due to environmental concerns.

===Further upgrades===
Schemes to upgrade the following sections have also been proposed:

&quot;Lamberhurst to Flimwell&quot;
&quot;Robertsbridge to Baldslow&quot;

<doc id="472346" wikidata="Q4649056" url="?curid=472346" title="A24 road (England)">
<text>The A24 is a major road in England that runs for from Clapham in south-west London to Worthing on the English Channel in West Sussex via the suburbs of south-west London, as well as through the counties of Surrey and West Sussex.

==Route==
Between Clapham and Dorking, the A24 closely follows the route of the old Roman road Stane Street. The Morden branch of the Northern line runs under the road from Clapham via Colliers Wood to Morden. Cycle Superhighway 7 also runs along the road from Clapham to Colliers Wood.

===Greater London===
====Lambeth &amp; Wandsworth====
The A24 starts at a junction with the A3 at the northeastern corner of Clapham Common, near Clapham Common tube station in the London Borough of Lambeth. South of Clapham Common station, the London Underground Northern line runs beneath the A24, following its route southbound. The A24 runs along the eastern perimeter of the Common, before meeting the South Circular near Clapham South tube station. Along this stretch of road, Cycle Superhighway 7 (CS7), which begins in the City of London, leaves the A3/Clapham High Street and follows the route of the A24. CS7 is marked by blue paint on either side of the road. 

Passing Clapham South, the A24 and CS7 enter the London Borough of Wandsworth. The routes are carried by Balham Hill, before becoming Balham High Road as they pass Balham station. Leaving Balham to the south, the A24 and CS7 arrive at Tooting Bec station at a junction with the A214.

Beyond Tooting Bec, the road is named Upper Tooting Road, before it becomes Tooting High Street as it passes Tooting Broadway station. At the station, the A24 and CS7 meet the A217/Garratt Lane. St George&#x27;s Hospital is situated to the northwest of the A24, west of Tooting Broadway station. The routes leave the London Borough of Wandsworth, and Inner London, a short distance to the south of Tooting.

==== Merton ====
The A24 and CS7 enter the London Borough of Merton as they cross via a railway bridge over the Sutton Loop Line, between Haydons Road and Tooting stations. The routes are carried by High Street Colliers Wood. The routes meet Colliers Wood tube station, where CS7 finishes. The A24 then meets the A238/Merton High Street, at which point the route turns left to become Christchurch Road. The Northern line also no longer follows the route of the A24 at this point, instead following that of the A238 towards South Wimbledon.

At a crossroads in Merton, Christchurch Road continues southwards as the A236 (towards Mitcham). The A24 turns right onto Merantun Way, crossing the River Wandle as it leaves Colliers Wood and Merton.

The road turns left onto Morden Road at a junction with the A219. It passes Morden Industrial Area, Morden Hall Park and the A297 before reaching Morden Underground station. As London Road it passes under the railway bridge by Morden South railway station. It passes the junction with the A239 Central Road next to Morden Park before becoming Epsom Road. The road runs through Lower Morden for a short distance and passes by Morden Cricket Club before exiting the borough.

==== Sutton ====
The road enters the North Cheam area of the London Borough of Sutton just before it reaches the Woodstock junction with the B279. It passes the Sutton Common area to the east and runs down the steep Stonecot Hill before it changes name to London Road. It passes St Anthony&#x27;s Hospital on the way into North Cheam before reaching the Queen Victoria crossroads with the A2043. The road then leaves the shopping environment and the area becomes more residential as it continues as London Road before exiting the borough and Greater London.

===Surrey===
====Epsom and Ewell====
The A24 continues as London Road, entering the borough of Epsom and Ewell in Surrey by Sparrow Farm Road in Stoneleigh. At this point, the speed limit increases to 40 mph and the road subsequently runs alongside Nonsuch Park. Two out of the three car parks for Nonsuch are on the road. The speed limit returns to 30 mph before reaching the Organ Crossroads, Ewell with the A240 and the B2200. The road becomes the Ewell By-Pass (40 mph limit). It passes a crossroads with the Ewell terminus of the A232 and the B2200 before running past the North East Surrey College of Technology, then approaches a roundabout with Reigate Road and the A240. 

It heads towards Epsom and becomes Epsom Road, then East Street and passes Kiln Lane, an industrial area with a large Sainsbury&#x27;s and various other shops. It also passes the Rainbow Leisure Centre as it heads into Epsom Town Centre. It passes a set of traffic lights by Hook Road immediately before it becomes Epsom High Street and goes around the one-way system by the Ashley Centre, Epsom Clock Tower and Epsom Playhouse before becoming South Street and Dorking Road. It passes Epsom General Hospital before beginning its long rural stretch to the south coast, first passing The Wells and Epsom Common before leaving the borough on a bridge over the Rye brook, a tributary of the River Mole.

====Mole Valley====
The road enters Ashtead, a large village in the Mole Valley District, and becomes Epsom Road. It passes Ashtead Common and Ashtead Park before changing name to The Street in the centre of Ashtead (its High Street). Once the road leaves the centre of Ashtead it becomes Leatherhead Road and passes Ashtead Hospital. It then enters Leatherhead and crosses the M25 just before the road turns left at the Knoll Roundabout. This is where the A243 starts and it is the way to Junction 9 of the M25, while the B2122 heads into Leatherhead town centre. The A24 becomes Bypass Road (Leatherhead) and the speed limit goes up from 40 mph (64 km/h) to 50 mph (80 km/h) as the road enters a more rural area.
It passes the B2033 (Reigate Road) at the Beaverbrook roundabout and continues for 0.6 miles (1 km) before turning left at the Givons Grove roundabout with the A246 and the B2450. It becomes Dorking Road, then the Mickleham By-pass and becomes a dual-carriageway. It passes the B2209 (Old London Road), the main road in Mickleham, a small village near Box Hill. The A24 runs next to Box Hill, passes two car parks and crosses the Burford Bridge over the River Mole. It then heads into the town of Dorking, passes the B2038 (Pixham Lane) and the A2003 (Ashcombe Road) near Dorking railway station. Just afterwards, the road passes near to Dorking (Deepdene) railway station, becomes Deepdene Avenue and runs on to the Deepdene Roundabout with the A25.

It exits central Dorking and becomes a lot less urban, entering North Holmwood just before another roundabout with the A2003 (Flint Hill) and Spook Hill. It continues south and passes the small villages of Mid Holmwood and South Holmwood, as well as Holmwood railway station, just before the northern end of the A29 and Newdigate Road. It changes name to Capel By-pass and passes near to the B2126 and Ockley railway station before it passes Capel village itself, which is 6 miles (9.7 km) south of Dorking. It passes Clark&#x27;s Green roundabout, which includes what becomes the main road in Capel. It runs south for another 2 miles (3.2 km) before exiting Surrey.

===West Sussex===

The A24 enters West Sussex before passing the small village of Kingsfold. Two miles further along, the road skirts the much larger village of Warnham. The road continues past a roundabout with the A264 where it turns right to form part of the Horsham by-pass. The dual carriageway continues past Southwater, the crossroads junction with the A272, Ashington, Washington and Findon before terminating in the seaside resort of Worthing at the A259 in the town centre.

<text>The A25 road is an east–west main road in the South-East of England. Its carries traffic east from Guildford, Surrey, eastward through Surrey and into mid-west Kent, to the town of Sevenoaks, and then on to Wrotham Heath where it connects with the A20.

The A25 exits east from Guildford, soon crossing southwards over the North Downs at Newlands Corner, to run eastward below the southern edge of the North Downs, with the road&#x27;s route alternating between the Vale of Holmesdale and the Greensand Ridge, passing through Dorking, Reigate, Redhill, Nutfield, Bletchingley, Godstone, Oxted, Westerham, Brasted, Sevenoaks and Borough Green. It crosses over the River Wey at Guildford, the River Mole at Dorking, the River Eden at Oxted, and the River Darent at Westerham. The A25 has junctions with several major London to south coast roads: the A24 at Dorking; the A23 at Redhill; the A22 at Godstone; and the A21 at Sevenoaks.

A short distance east of Borough Green, at Wrotham Heath, the A25 ends at a junction with the A20, which continues eastward towards Maidstone, and then south-east to Ashford, Folkestone, and then Dover. At its west end in Guildford, the A25 connects with the A3 which takes traffic towards Portsmouth on the south coast. Before leaving Guildford, the A3 connects the A25 with the A31, which continues the westward route to Farnham, before tracking south-westward to Winchester and Bournemouth.

The M25 motorway parallels the A25 between Reigate and Sevenoaks, with connections at Reigate, Godstone, and Sevenoaks. The M26 motorway parallels the A25 between Sevenoaks and Wrotham Heath.

==Route==

The east of the route the Victoria County History describes as a main road in 1911. Relatively briefly the modern road uses bypasses and straightened cuts. Many of the inns along its path were one time staging inns. One of the earliest sections of the M25 motorway runs parallel and to the north of the A25: hence the London Orbital Road was numbered M25.

As such, most of the route is a single carriageway and a very small minority of it is a dual carriageway: the junctions at Guildford and Redhill.

Its route is or less at all points south of the North Downs which has the Pilgrims&#x27; Way (here also known as the North Downs Way) and roughly follows an ancient trackway, which was longer and stretched to Salisbury, Wiltshire, the Harrow Way. The range is an intermittently broken by river valleys, variable width escarpment with a steep southern slope, often quarried away into vertical faces, it includes Botley Hill and Box Hill and this ridge is one of the two mentioned ranges of hills which form in the western half the Surrey Hills AONB.

The route has been included in the London-Surrey Cycle Classic alongside the entrances to Hatchlands Park and Clandon Park in Surrey. The east of the county has Reigate Castle along its route. Combe Bank Landscaped Grounds and Squerryes Court are along the route in west Kent, bringing the total of listed English gardens along the route to four.

<text>Frances Curran (born 21 May 1961) is a former co-chair of the Scottish Socialist Party. She was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the West of Scotland region from 2003 to 2007.

==Political career==
A former member of the Labour Party and an organiser for the entryist Militant group, Curran became a high-profile figure in Scottish left politics on her election to the Scottish Parliament as a Scottish Socialist Party MSP in 2003. She had joined the SSP on its formation in 1998, and brought political experience she had gained while she served as the youth representative on Labour&#x27;s National Executive Committee.

In July 2005, Curran played a role in organising the protest outside Gleneagles at the 2005 G8 Summit. The previous week, she and other SSP MSPs took part in a protest within the Scottish Parliament, which led to them being suspended for the month of September and fined £30,000. This protest was due to their claim that the First Minister had gone back on his word that the parliament would support the rally outside the Perthshire hotel.

Curran was the public face of the SSP&#x27;s campaign for the provision of nutritious free school meals, which they said would tackle ill health and poor diet in Scottish schoolchildren. Her campaign drew a wide base of support from a number of children&#x27;s and health charities. As part of the Save Our Services campaign, she was involved in community occupations to stop the closure of a school and community centre. In 2007, she was arrested but not charged at an anti-nuclear protest at Faslane as part of the Faslane 365 campaign.

She was an unsuccessful candidate in the July 2008 Glasgow East by-election. During the campaign, she was informed that the police had received death threats against her.

She stood again as a candidate on the Glasgow regional list for the Holyrood election in 2011, but failed to be elected. She had stepped down as the party&#x27;s national co-spokesperson less than a month before the election.

Curran was elected to the SSP&#x27;s Executive Committee in 2012 but stood down again in 2013, keeping a low profile throughout the party&#x27;s referendum campaign. She was elected as party co-chair alongside Bill Bonnar at the 2014 conference, but withdrew her nomination for the position on the day of the 2015 conference seven months later. She was re-elected to the SSP executive at its 2016 conference.

At the 2018 conference she stood for national spokesperson, but lost to Róisín McLaren.

<text>Adolphe Charles Adam (; 24 July 1803 – 3 May 1856) was a French composer, teacher and music critic. A prolific composer for the theatre, he is best known today for his ballets &quot;Giselle&quot; (1841) and &quot;Le corsaire&quot; (1856), his operas &quot;Le postillon de Lonjumeau&quot; (1836) and &quot;Si j&#x27;étais roi&quot; (1852) and his Christmas carol &quot;Minuit, chrétiens!&quot; (Midnight, Christians, 1847, known in English as &quot;O Holy Night&quot;).

Adam was the son of a well-known composer and pianist, but his father did not wish him to pursue a musical career. Adam defied his father, and his many operas and ballets earned him a good living until he lost all his money in 1848 in a disastrous bid to open a new opera house in Paris in competition with the Opéra and Opéra-Comique. He recovered, and extended his activities to journalism and teaching. He was appointed as a professor at the Paris Conservatoire, France&#x27;s principal music academy.

Together with his older contemporary Daniel Auber and his teacher Adrien Boieldieu, Adam is credited with creating the later Romantic French form of opera.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Adam&#x27;s father, Louis, 1834|thumb|upright|alt=middle aged, clean-shaven white man with full head of neatly cut white hair
Adam was born in Paris on 24 July 1803, the elder of the two children, both sons, of (Jean) Louis Adam and his third wife, Élisa, &quot;née&quot; Coste. She was the daughter of a prominent physician, and was a former pupil of her husband, a well-known composer, pianist and professor at the Paris Conservatoire. Louis Adam gave his son lessons, but the boy was reluctant to learn even the basics of musical theory, and instead played fluently by ear:

He later said that he never became a fluent sight-reader of a score. His mother concluded that her son needed a rigorous education, and he was sent to a boarding school, the Hix institute in the Champs-Élysées. It had a high reputation both academically and musically: his elder contemporary (and pupil of Louis Adam) Ferdinand Hérold had been educated there, and the music master was Henry Lemoine, another of Louis&#x27; former students. Adolphe was not an academic child, and recalled in his memoirs how he had recoiled from the study of Latin, which he found &quot;barbaric&quot;. The fall of the French Empire in 1814–15, and the ensuing economic problems badly affected Louis Adam&#x27;s income, and to save money his son was sent to a less expensive school. The staff there were capable, but Adam remained as indifferent to musical theory as to Latin.

At the age of 17 Adam enrolled at the Conservatoire, where he studied the organ with François Benoist, counterpoint with Anton Reicha and composition with Adrien Boieldieu. Adam&#x27;s biographer Elizabeth Forbes calls Boieldieu the chief architect of Adam&#x27;s musical development. He set his student exercises that taught him to compose sustained melodies without showy modulations and other technical devices. Adam&#x27;s father did not want his son to become a professional composer: he would have preferred him to pursue a commercial or academic career, and although he gave Adam board and lodging he refused to subsidise any musical activities. By the age of 20 Adam was contributing songs to the Paris vaudeville theatres, writing what he later called &quot;bad romances and worse piano pieces&quot;, and giving music lessons.

Duchaume, timpanist and chorus master of the new Théâtre du Gymnase, offered Adam an unpaid post playing the triangle in the orchestra. Adam said that as he would have paid to be allowed to join he was happy to serve without a salary, but he was quickly promoted to a well paid position:
In 1824 Adam entered the Conservatoire&#x27;s most important musical competition, the . He gained an honourable mention, and the following year, at his second attempt, he won the second prize. Forbes writes that Adam derived more benefit from helping Boieldieu with the preparation of his opera &quot;La Dame blanche&quot;, produced at the Opéra-Comique in December 1825. Adam&#x27;s piano transcriptions of themes from the opera were published in 1826 and made him enough money to tour the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland in summer 1826 with a family friend, Sébastien Guillié. In Geneva he met the librettist Eugène Scribe, with whom he later collaborated on nine stage works.

===Early successes===

During 1824–1827 Adam wrote or arranged the music for several one-act vaudevilles given at the Gymnase and the Théâtre du Vaudeville, including four written by Scribe as sole or co-author. In late 1827 Scribe provided the text for Adam&#x27;s first opera, a one-act comic piece, &quot;Le Mal du pays, ou La Batelière de Brientz&quot; (Homesickness, or the Bargewoman of Brientz), comprising an overture and eleven numbers; it was produced at the Gymnase on 28 December 1827. A little over a year later, in February 1829, Adam&#x27;s second one-act opera, &quot;Pierre et Catherine&quot;, was given in a double bill at the Opéra-Comique with Auber and Scribe&#x27;s &quot;La Fiancée&quot;, and ran for more than 80 performances.

Seven months after the premiere of &quot;Pierre et Catherine&quot; Adam married Sara Lescot, a member of the chorus at the Vaudeville. Adam&#x27;s biographer Arthur Pougin describes the marriage as &quot;an important and unfortunate event for him&quot;. By Pougin&#x27;s account, Lescot manoeuvred Adam into marriage, and on his side – and later hers also – it was a loveless union; they separated in 1835. Their only child, Léopold-Adrien, born in 1832, killed himself in 1851.

Adam&#x27;s first full length operas were premiered in 1829: &quot;Le jeune propriétaire et le vieux fermier&quot; and &quot;Danilowa&quot;, opéras comiques given at the Théâtre des Nouveautés and the Opéra-Comique respectively. &quot;Danilowa&quot; ran well until Parisian life was disrupted by the July Revolution. That, and an outbreak of cholera, led Adam to move to London; this was at the suggestion of his brother-in-law, Pierre François Laporte, manager of the King&#x27;s Theatre, Haymarket. In 1832 Laporte leased the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, and in October, as an afterpiece to &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, he presented James Planché&#x27;s &quot;His First Campaign&quot;, a &quot;Military Spectacle&quot; about the Duke of Marlborough, with music by Adam. The piece was received with &quot;loud and general plaudits&quot;, but &quot;The Dark Diamond&quot;, a historical melodrama in three acts, which followed on 5 November, failed to repeat its success, and Adam went home to Paris in December. He returned briefly to London when his ballet &quot;Faust&quot; was presented at the King&#x27;s Theatre in February and March 1833.

===Peak career===
In 1834 Adam had one of his greatest popular successes with &quot;Le chalet&quot;, at the Opéra-Comique. This was a one-act opéra comique with words by Scribe and Mélesville based on Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Jery und Bätely&quot;. It was given more than 1000 times in Paris over the next four decades. In May 1836 Adam was appointed as a chevalier of the Legion of Honour, later promoted to officer of the order. His first work for the Paris Opéra was a ballet, &quot;La fille du Danube&quot;, introduced by Marie Taglioni in September 1836. Within days of the premiere of that piece, his three-act opéra comique &quot;Le postillon de Lonjumeau&quot; opened successfully at the Opéra-Comique. It was the composer&#x27;s greatest operatic success internationally, quickly taken up by foreign managements and seen in London in 1837 and New York in 1840.

During 1838 and 1839 Adam composed the music for &quot;Les Mohicans&quot;, a ballet for the Opéra, and four operas for the Opéra-Comique, and in September 1839 he left Paris for St Petersburg. His ballet for Taglioni, &quot;L&#x27;Écumeur de mer&quot; (The Pirate) was given before the imperial court in February 1840, and two of his operas were staged. He left Russia for Paris at the end of March, stopping off in Berlin, where he wrote an opera-ballet, &quot;Die Hamadryaden&quot; (The Tree Nymphs), which he conducted at the Court Opera in April 1840.

Adam&#x27;s next substantial work was the composition by which he has become best known: the ballet &quot;Giselle&quot;. Based on Heinrich Heine&#x27;s version of an old tale, the ballet premiered at the Opéra on 28 June 1841 with Carlotta Grisi in the title role. Adam continued his prolific output, including his first grand opera, &quot;Richard en Palestine&quot;, which was produced at the Opéra in 1844 but aroused little interest. In that year he was elected to membership of the Académie des Beaux-Arts.

===Financial disaster===

In 1845 François-Louis Crosnier, director of the Opéra-Comique, resigned and was succeeded by Alexandre Basset. Basset soon fell out with Adam and told him that as long as he was director, Adam&#x27;s works would never be performed at the Opéra-Comique. Early in 1847 a theatre in the Boulevard du Temple became available, and Adam, in partnership with the actor Achille Mirecour, took it over, rechristening it the Opéra-National. The cost of refurbishing the theatre was enormous, and in addition to investing his own money, Adam raised large sums in loans. The new opera house opened in November 1847, but from the outset its prospects looked doubtful. Financial and artistic performance alike were poor, and the 1848 Revolution was the final blow to the enterprise. The theatres were closed by the incoming régime, and when they were permitted to re-open, there was little demand for tickets at Adam&#x27;s opera house, which closed on 28 March 1848, after the production of nine operas during its four months of existence, leaving him financially ruined.

Adam assigned the royalties from his earlier works to help pay off his debts, and like many other French composers in need of money he turned to journalism to earn extra income. He contributed reviews and articles to &quot;Le Constitutionnel&quot; and the &quot;Assemblée nationale&quot;. He also became a teacher, accepting the post of professor of composition at the Conservatoire, where his students included Léo Delibes. Meanwhile, Basset having left the Opéra-Comique at the time of the revolution, Adam was able to return to what Forbes calls his spiritual home under its new director, Émile Perrin.

===Last years===

In July 1850 &quot;Giralda,&quot; ou &quot;La nouvelle psyché&quot; – one of Adam&#x27;s best operas in Forbes&#x27;s view – was given at the Opéra-Comique. In 1851 his estranged wife died, and Adam married the singer Chérie-Louise Couraud (1817–1880), with whom he lived for his remaining years. For the Théâtre-Lyrique, the revived incarnation of his failed Opéra-National, Adam wrote the successful &quot;Si j&#x27;étais roi&quot;, first given in September 1852. In that year he produced six new works, enabling him to clear all his debts.

During the last three years of his life Adam continued to compose prolifically. His late works include what Forbes rates as one of his finest ballets, &quot;Le Corsaire&quot;, based on a poem by Byron; it was presented at the Opéra in January 1856, after a year&#x27;s preparation. His final stage work, the one-act opérette &quot;Les Pantins de Violette&quot; (Violette&#x27;s Puppets) was given at the Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens on 29 April 1856. Four nights later Adam died in his sleep, at the age of 52. He was buried in the Montmartre Cemetery.

==Works==

In &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, Forbes writes that much of Adam&#x27;s prolific output was ephemeral. This includes the many popular numbers he wrote for vaudevilles in his early years, a large number of piano arrangements, transcriptions and potpourris of favourite operatic arias, and numerous light songs and ballads. Nonetheless, &quot;there remain several operas and ballets that are not merely delightful examples of their kind, but are also scores full of genuine inspiration&quot;. In this category Forbes includes &quot;Le chalet&quot; (which incorporates music from the cantata he wrote for the 1825 Prix de Rome competition) which she ranks with Adam&#x27;s best works for its freshness of invention. For the musicologist Theodore Baker, Adam ranks with Auber and Boieldieu as one of the creators of French opera, thanks to the expressive power of his melodic material and his keen sense of dramatic development.

In France, during Adam&#x27;s lifetime and beyond, &quot;Le chalet&quot; was his most popular opera. In other countries the favourite was &quot;Le postillon de Lonjumeau&quot;. In Germany in particular the opera was celebrated for its tenor aria &quot;Mes amis, écoutez l&#x27;histoire&quot; (given in translation as &quot;Freunde, vernehmet die Geschichte&quot;), with its demanding high D. &quot;Grove&quot; comments that the opera has distinctive and well characterised roles and a sense of theatre, found in all Adam&#x27;s operas. Of the later operas, &quot;Grove&quot; singles out &quot;Giralda&quot; and &quot;Si j&#x27;étais roi&quot; as &quot;the most stylish, tuneful and accomplished&quot;.

Although he was a prolific composer of opera, Adam wrote ballet music even more fluently. He commented that it was fun, rather than work. &quot;Giselle&quot; is the best known; Baker calls it a major work in the history of choreography, which continues to be performed with the same success. Forbes comments that although &quot;Giselle&quot; has the advantage of a particularly memorable plot, &quot;La jolie fille de Gand&quot;, &quot;La filleule des fées&quot; and &quot;Le corsaire&quot; are of equal quality musically.

Little of Adam&#x27;s religious music has entered the regular repertory, with the exception of his Cantique de Noël, &quot;Minuit, chrétiens!&quot;, known in English as &quot;O Holy Night&quot;.

Adam&#x27;s memoirs were published posthumously, in two volumes: &quot;Souvenirs d&#x27;un musicien&quot; (1857) and &quot;Derniers souvenirs d&#x27;un musicien&quot; (1859).

In 2023 an exhaustive two-volume study of his stage works (one volume on opera, the other on ballet) by Robert Ignatius Letellier and Nicholas Lester Fuller entitled &quot;Adolphe Adam, Master of the Opéra-Comique 1824-1856&quot; was published.

<text>Robert Maurice Lipson Winston, Baron Winston (born 15 July 1940) is a British professor, medical doctor, scientist, television presenter and Labour peer.

==Early life==
Robert Winston was born in London to Laurence Winston and Ruth Winston-Fox, and brought up as an Orthodox Jew. His mother was Mayor of the former Borough of Southgate. Winston&#x27;s father died as a result of medical negligence when Winston was nine years old. Robert has two younger siblings: a sister, the artist Willow Winston, and a brother, Anthony.

Winston attended firstly Salcombe Preparatory School until the age of 7, followed by Colet Court and St Paul&#x27;s School, later graduating from The London Hospital Medical College in 1964 with a degree in medicine and surgery and achieved prominence as an expert in human fertility. For a brief time he gave up clinical medicine and worked as a theatre director, winning the National Directors&#x27; Award at the Edinburgh Festival in 1969.

==Medical career==
Winston joined Hammersmith Hospital as a registrar in 1970 as a Wellcome Research Fellow. He became an associate professor at the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium in 1975. He was a scientific advisor to the World Health Organisation&#x27;s programme in human reproduction from 1975 to 1977. He joined the Royal Postgraduate Medical School (based at Hammersmith Hospital) as consultant and Reader in 1977.

After conducting research as Professor of Gynaecology at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio in 1980, he returned to the UK to run the IVF service set up at Hammersmith Hospital which pioneered various improvements in this technology. He became Dean of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in London until its merger with Imperial College in 1997. He was Director of NHS Research and Development at the Hammersmith Hospitals Trust until 1994. As Professor of Fertility Studies at Hammersmith, Winston led the IVF team that pioneered pre-implantation genetic diagnosis to identify defects in human embryos, and published early work on gene expression in human embryos. He developed tubal microsurgery and various techniques in reproductive surgery, including sterilisation reversal. He performed the world&#x27;s first fallopian tubal transplant in 1979 but this technology was later superseded by in vitro fertilisation. Together with Alan Handyside in 1990, his research group pioneered the techniques of pre-implantation diagnosis, enabling screening of human embryos to prevent numerous genetic diseases.

He was the president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science from 2004 to 2005. Together with Carol Readhead of the California Institute of Technology, Winston researched male germ cell stem cells and methods for their genetic modification at the Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Imperial College London. He has published over 300 scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals. He was appointed to a new chair at Imperial College – Professor of Science and Society – and is also emeritus professor of Fertility Studies there. He was Chairman of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Trust and chairs the Women-for-Women Appeal. This charitable trust, which has raised over £80 million for research into reproductive diseases, was renamed the Genesis Research Trust in 1997. From 2001 to 2018 he was Chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University.

Winston is a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci), an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (HonFREng), a Fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (FRCOG) and of the Royal College of Physicians of London (FRCP), and is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (FRCS Edin), Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons (FRCPS Glasg), and the Royal Society of Biology (FRSB). He holds honorary doctorates from twenty-three universities. He is a trustee of the UK Stem Cell Foundation. He is a patron of The Liggins Institute, University of Auckland, New Zealand.

===Opinions===
====Fertility treatment====
Winston holds strong views about the commercialisation of fertility treatment. He believes that ineffective treatments result in great anguish to couples and is alarmed that so many treatments for the symptom of infertility are carried out before proper investigation and diagnosis has been made. He is also sceptical about the effectiveness of current methods for screening human embryos to assess their viability.

====Gender affirming surgeries====
Winston has called gender-affirming surgery &quot;mutilation&quot; and has said that &quot;we can remove bits of our body and change our shape and so on but you can&#x27;t change your sex because that is embedded in your genes in every cell of your body.&quot;

====Science as truth====
Winston has said &quot;I think there has to be a clear understanding that science is not the truth. It’s a version of the truth.&quot;

==Media career==

Winston was the presenter of many BBC television series, including &quot;Your Life in Their Hands&quot;, &quot;Making Babies&quot;, &quot;Superhuman&quot;, &quot;The Secret Life of Twins&quot;, &quot;Child of Our Time&quot;, &quot;Human Instinct&quot;, &quot;The Human Mind&quot;, &quot;Frontiers of Medicine&quot; and the BAFTA award-winner &quot;The Human Body&quot;. As a traditional Jew with an orthodox background, he also presented &quot;The Story of God&quot;, exploring the development of religious beliefs and the status of faith in a scientific age.

He presented the BBC documentary &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot;, a major BBC series that presented some controversial views about early man but was endorsed by anthropologists and scientists. One theory was that &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; have a uniquely developed imagination that helped them to survive.

Winston&#x27;s documentary &quot;Threads of Life&quot; won the international science film prize in Paris in 2005. His BBC series &quot;Child Against All Odds&quot; explored ethical questions raised by IVF treatment. In 2008, he presented &quot;Super Doctors&quot;, about decisions made every day in frontier medicine.

In 2007, Winston appeared in the TV series &quot;Play It Again&quot;, in which he attempted to learn to play the saxophone, despite not having played a musical instrument since the age of 11, when he learned the recorder.

Among many BBC Radio 4 programmes, he has appeared on &quot;The Archers&quot; radio soap as a fertility consultant. He has regularly appeared on &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot; as a panellist as well as numerous chat show programmes such as &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot;, &quot;This Morning&quot;, &quot;The One Show&quot; and various political programmes such as &quot;Question Time&quot; and &quot;Any Questions&quot;. Winston is featured in the &quot;Symphony of Science&quot; episode &quot;Ode to the Brain&quot;.

He also took part in the 2011 TV series &quot;Jamie&#x27;s Dream School&quot;. In recent years, Winston has been featured on &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot; in the United States, presenting various entertaining scientific experiments.

==Political career==
Winston was created a life peer on 18 December 1995 as &quot;Baron Winston, of Hammersmith in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham&quot;. He sits on the Labour Party benches in the House of Lords and takes the Labour whip. He speaks frequently in the House of Lords on education, science, medicine and the arts. He was Chairman of the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology and is a board member and vice-chairman of the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, which provides advice to both Houses of Parliament. He is a member of Labour Friends of Israel. 

Winston has made a number of claims regarding the impact of segregated cycle lanes on air quality and emissions in Central London. He is a member of the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, an advisory board created in 2019 and sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, which works on ethical and innovative deployment of data-enabled technologies including artificial intelligence.

==Personal life==
In 1973, Winston married Lira Helen Feigenbaum (born 8 August 1949). They had three children, Joel, Tanya and Ben who is a film and TV producer and director. Lady Winston died on 9 December 2021. Winston is a fan of Arsenal Football Club. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, a former vice-president of the Royal College of Music and a member of the Garrick Club, the MCC, and the Athenaeum Club in London. He owns a classic 1930s Bentley.

Winston was a council member of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund and Cancer Research UK, and until 2013 was a member of the Engineering &amp; Physical Sciences Research Council where he chaired the Societal Issues Panel. He gives many public lectures a year on scientific subjects and has helped to promote science literacy and education by founding the Reach Out Laboratory in Imperial College, which brings schoolchildren of all ages into the university on a daily basis to do practical science and to debate the issues which science and technology raise. Extending this school outreach activity, he acts as ambassador for Outreach for the President of Imperial College, visiting schools across England to discuss scientific issues and career aspiration with students.

<text>This list of Royal Air Force groups is an overview of all [[Group (air force)|groups]], current and former, of the Royal Air Force (RAF). An air force group is a high-level controlling organisational formation, subordinate only to command level. Individual groups within the Royal Air Force have overall command and responsibility for major operational tasks of the RAF; for example: combat, combat support, training and administration.

, there are only five active groups. Four are in the United Kingdom while the fifth, a more skeleton organisation, is in the Middle East. No. 1 Group (1 Gp), No. 2 Group (2 Gp), No. 11 Group (11 Gp), No. 22 Group (22 Gp) are in the UK. All four groups are now effectively subdivisions and staff branches of the larger Air Command headquarters, as all are at High Wycombe. No. 83 Expeditionary Air Group (83 EAG), the renamed UK Air Component Headquarters in the Middle East, has its headquarters at Al Udeid in Qatar.

<text>The A31 is a major trunk road in southern England that runs from Guildford in Surrey to Bere Regis in Dorset.
Its best-known section is the Hog&#x27;s Back, a ridge forming part of the North Downs between Guildford and Farnham in Surrey.

==Route description==
The road begins near Guildford station at the start of Farnham Road, coming out of the town and passing over the A3, shortly after becoming a dual carriageway running west along the Hog&#x27;s Back escarpment of the North Downs. This dual carriageway section has a speed limit of 60 mph. At Tongham it leaves the older Hog&#x27;s Back route to join the A331 and follow a modern bypass round Farnham, rejoining the older route at the roundabout junction with the A325 where it follows Alton Road toward Alton which it bypasses, rejoining the older route near Jane Austen&#x27;s house, then continuing to Alresford before joining the route of the M3 motorway at its junction on the eastern boundary of Winchester.

The old route to Winchester&#x27;s centre then Romsey and the New Forest forms two roads: the B3404 and A3090 roads and is marked for cyclists. The west branch of the M27 motorway – M3 interchange has a flyover junction with the winding westbound A3090 on the western boundary of Cadnam, having passed through the conservation area village centre, from where the resumed A31 continues as a dualled trunk road through the rest of the New Forest, past Ringwood and enters Dorset just before it passes Ferndown where it resumes single carriageway width. It passes Wimborne Minster and by-passes Charborough Park before terminating at a roundabout junction with the A35 road at Bere Regis. The A35 is not a trunk road east of Bere Regis, but is a continuation of the A31 trunk road to the west, thus the Highways Agency maintain it.

The A31 is part of the ancient route from London to Winchester.

The A31 between Wimborne Minster and Bere Regis: most of its Dorset stretch is primarily a single-carriageway road, used by heavy goods vehicles, and as such is relatively slow for a trunk road during busy times of the day. However the River Stour is one of the most flood-prone rivers alongside in the region and a widened road would accelerate drainage and disrupt views of the valley from Areas of Outstanding Beauty on the escarpments to the north.

===A31 New Forest dual carriageway===
Many sections of the A31 were upgraded to dual carriageway in the 1960s, except for the section of road running through the New Forest.

The upgrade of the A31 through the New Forest started in the early 1960s, following two decades of debate. The Government&#x27;s intention was to create at least one high-speed route to the south coast, while the guardians of the forest, the Verderers, resisted any further development.

The first section of the A31 to be dualled was the section that the M27 feeds into at Jct1; the westbound carriageway is the original two-way A-road while the eastbound side was laid down nearby. Further developments occurred from Ringwood to Picket Post near the turn-off for Burley. From 1966 to 1972, the remaining sections were completed rapidly due to the construction of the M27 motorway up to Jct 1.

The Highways Agency declares the New Forest A31 section as being &#x27;an abnormal and heavy load route&#x27;. The westbound route, particularly, suffers from poor horizontal and vertical alignment due to its original function as an old single carriageway. The Highways Agency&#x27;s route management strategy (RMS) for the A31 has identified that the westbound carriageway needs realigning at Cadnam where it undulates rapidly before negotiating a sharp right turn and passes an at-grade U-turn box, though there is no timetable for this at present. There is also a pinch point at Ringwood where the A31 interplexes with the A338; the section of road was widened to four lanes each way for the duration of the A338 interplex (following the upgrade of the Ashley Heath Junction to Bournemouth in the early 1990s) but a short section where westbound A338 traffic joins westbound A31 was left with 2 lanes, and previously the lack of capacity at this section caused safety problems and queues at peak times. Dorset County Council cited relieving this junction as a high priority in the Bournemouth LTP 2006–2011. In December 2014 the Government announced a series of schemes as part of a £15bn investment in transport infrastructure that included widening the Westbound carriageway to 3 lanes. Work to widen the westbound section to 3 lanes began in January 2022 in conjunction with a wider scheme improving safety, and replacing two bridges over the River Avon and Bickerley Millstream. The widening scheme was completed in November 2022. 
A Highways Agency review in 2010 records that the collision rate between the A338 Ringwood junction and the Poulner Hill Interchange was 4.5 Personal Injury Collisions (PICs) per 100million vehicle kilometers, whilst the rate for the stretch between Poulner Hill and Picket Post is 11.7 PICs per 100million vehicle kilometers.

===A31 between Bere Regis and Wimborne===
This section of road is single carriageway for its entire length, a long section around Winterborne Zelston has a 40 mph speed limit, and occasionally has mobile speed cameras in place.

There are no good overtaking places on this stretch of road due to its narrow, twisty nature. There are three long straight sections of road along Charborough Park, at the end of each straight there is blind bend. Due to the lack of alternative overtaking places traffic use this stretch of road to overtake, but due to the blind bends this sometimes results in head-on collisions between vehicles. The 6 ft wall that runs alongside the road has many holes, and repaired sections which have been hit by cars over the years.

The A31 crosses the A350 at a large roundabout. Due to the volume of traffic crossing this roundabout on both the A350 and A31, clear lane markings have been added to ease congestion.

Sections along the A31 have been widened or straightened and junctions enhanced, particularly as the population of the main towns in Dorset has expanded.

===A3090 road===

A section of the A31 between Winchester and Ower in Hampshire is now known as the A3090.

Prior to completion of the M3 past Winchester in 1995, the A3090 ran south west from the A33 at Kings Worthy (where the A33 diverted around the Winchester Bypass) to the centre of Winchester, before continuing along the historic route of the A31 from Winchester to Hursley. Here it ended at a junction with the A31, which at this time, having merged with the by-pass east of Winchester, re-emerged from the A33 at Otterbourne and ran to Hursley and on along the current route of the A3090.

A short dual carriageway section starts from the A36 roundabout near Ower and terminates just before the A27 multiplex south west of Romsey.

===B3404 road===
A short stretch of the original A31 immediately to the east of Winchester is now by-passed and renumbered as the B3404. The old route commences at a roundabout at Morn Hill, and continues straight across the top of Magdalen Hill Down before crossing over the M3 motorway and A272 road on an overbridge and then descending the steep street of Magdalen Hill into the centre of Winchester.

<text>The A75 is a primary trunk road in Scotland, linking Stranraer and its ferry ports at Cairnryan with the A74(M) at Gretna, close to the border with England and the M6 motorway.

==Route==
Heading west along the south coast of Scotland from its junction with the A74(M) motorway at Gretna it continues past Eastriggs, Annan, Dumfries, Castle Douglas, Gatehouse of Fleet, Newton Stewart, Kirkcowan and Glenluce before ending at Stranraer.

The majority of the road is of single-carriageway standard, although a few short dual carriageway sections exist, including a one-mile section past Gretna, a section past Collin (just east of Dumfries,) a two-mile section just west of Dumfries and a 1-mile section at Barlae (Between Glenluce and Newton Stewart). The road is widely felt to be unfit for the current large volumes of freight using it, but successive Westminster and laterly Scottish Governments have repeatedly shelved previously planned substantive upgrades, and delayed much needed, meaningful, investment in the route for decades, believed to be a root cause of Wigtownshire now being one of the most deprived areas of the UK.
There are also numerous three-lane overtaking sections which allow overtaking in one direction or on some occasion both directions. The road has recently been re-routed at Carrutherstown (near Dumfries) and a bypass has been constructed to avoid the village of Dunragit and the frequently struck Challoch Railway Bridge, which has earned the title of &quot;most hit bridge in the UK.&quot;

There are only two service stations on the A75: one at Collin on the eastern edge of Dumfries, and one at Castle Kennedy to the east of Stranraer.

The road forms part of the international E-road, European route E18.

The majority of heavy goods vehicles which cross the short sea route of the North Channel via Cairnryan use the A75, with a much as 90% of HGV traffic using the A75.

In January 2020, Transport Scotland concluded a transport study of South West Scotland and outlined options for investment to the A75 and other trunk roads. In case of the construction of an Irish Sea Bridge from Great Britain to Northern Ireland (Wigtownshire to Antrim), further road widening and potentially an upgrade to motorway status may be required.

==History==

The mostly single-carriageway road has been re-aligned, re-routed and bypasses most towns in recognition of the heavy freight traffic it carries between the A74(M)/M6 and the ferry ports for Northern Ireland at Cairnryan. Only two settlements are now not bypassed by it (at Springholm and Crocketford, which are situated 10 and 12 miles west of Dumfries respectively.

The 1.3-mile stretch of dual carriageway and associated one-mile westbound overtaking lane one-mile west of Dumfries opened in 1999, which replaced the previous bottleneck road which snaked up a wooded glen and afforded no overtaking opportunity by way of solid double white lines for its duration, locally known as &quot;The Glen&quot;. The new section claimed the title after the previous road was declassified and closed at the western end, allowing only local access to residential property and agricultural land.

Transport Scotland has six completed projects announced in 2008 to improve stretches of the A75.

# Barfil to Bettyknowes Project – westbound overtaking opportunity over a length of 875metres and re-alignment.
# Cairntop to Barlae Project – eastbound overtaking opportunity of 2.5 kilometres, utilising the line of a disused railway line.
# Dunragit Bypass Project – bypass of the village of Dunragit, to the east of Stranraer, through which the A75 runs at present.
# Hardgrove Project – the construction of a new 3.6 kilometre stretch of the A75, between Carrutherstown and Upper Mains Farm in Dumfries and Galloway, providing improved overtaking facilities in both the east and westbound directions.
# Newton Stewart DAL Project – westbound overtaking opportunity over a length of 375 metres.
# Planting End to Drumflower Project – eastbound overtaking opportunity over a length of 1 kilometre

Previously the road ran between Dumfries &amp; Gretna further south than its current locale, The previous road which is identified locally as the &quot;low road&quot; can be recognised from the B721 and B724 roads. A large majority of the remaining road previously ran through towns &amp; settlements which have been bypassed over time, most sections of the A75 have been straightened, bypassed and re-aligned, with the majority still visible as minor roads and easily identifiable by studying Ordnance Survey maps of the area. One of the earliest bypasses on the route is that of Kirkcowan, which is believed to be the first village, town or settlement to have been bypassed by the original A75.

The previous county and regional councils held responsibility for the A75 prior to 1996 and continually upgraded and re-aligned the A75 over several decades forming much of the current alignment. Bypasses at Glenluce, Shennanton, Newton Stewart, Blackcraig, Creetown, Carsluith, Skyreburn, Gatehouse of Fleet/Barharrow, Tywnholm, Valleyfield, Ringford, Bridge of Dee, Castle Douglas, Ramhill, Southpark, Dumfries, Collin, Raffles, Carrutherstown, Annan and Gretna along with substantial re-alignment elsewhere were built during the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s to form much of the current standard of road seen today. The only limited improved sections still in existence but widened are between Barlae and Shennanton (Kirkcowan) and Kirkclaugh to Mossyard (Gatehouse of Fleet).

==Reports of haunting==

A four-mile stretch of the A75 known as the &quot;Kinmount Straight&quot; between Carrutherstown and Annan, is claimed by some to be haunted. The section adjacent to Kelhead Moss Plantation (an effective avenue of trees), near Kinmount House, is a main site of the alleged mysterious events. Sightings have been claimed to have been seen near the Swordwellrigg hamlet on the Annan bypass.

1962
Derek and Norman Ferguson were driving along the A75 near Kinmount, around midnight, when they claim that a large hen flew towards their window screen but vanished on the point of impact. They claim that the hen was followed by an old lady who ran towards the car waving her outstretched arms. They say that she was followed by a screaming man with long hair and further animals, including &#x27;great cats, wild dogs, goats, more hens and other fowl, and stranger creatures&#x27;, who all disappeared. They further claim that the temperature then dropped, and when the brothers stopped the car, it began to sway violently back and forth. Derek got out of the car and the movement stopped. He climbed back in and then, finally, claims that a vision of a furniture van came towards them before disappearing.

The poem gives an account of a failed raid of Igor Svyatoslavich (d. 1202) against the Polovtsians of the Don River region.
While some have disputed the authenticity of the poem, the current scholarly consensus is that the poem is authentic and dates to the Middle Ages (late 12th century).

The &quot;Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot; was adapted by Alexander Borodin as an opera and became one of the great classics of Russian theatre. Entitled &quot;Prince Igor&quot;, it was first performed in 1890.

==Content==
The story describes a failed raid made in year 1185 by &quot;Kniaz&quot; Igor Svyatoslavich, Prince of Novgorod-Seversk, on the Polovtsians living along the lower Don. Other Rus&#x27; historical figures are mentioned, including skald Boyan (&quot;The Bard&quot;), the princes Vseslav of Polotsk, Yaroslav Osmomysl of Halych, and Vsevolod the Big Nest of Suzdal. The author appeals to the warring Rus&#x27; princes and pleads for unity in the face of the constant threat from the Turkic East. Igor&#x27;s campaign is recorded in the &quot;Kievan Chronicle&quot; (c. 1200).

The descriptions show coexistence between Christianity and ancient Slavic religion. Igor&#x27;s wife Yaroslavna invokes natural forces from the walls of Putyvl. Christian motifs are presented along with depersonalised pagan gods among the artistic images. The main themes of the story are patriotism, the power and role of nature (at the time of the story, 12th century) and homeland. The main idea is the unity of people.

The &quot;Tale&quot; has been compared to other national epics, including &quot;The Song of Roland&quot; and &quot;The Song of the Nibelungs&quot;. The book however differs from contemporary Western epics on account of its numerous and vivid descriptions of nature and the portrayal of the role which nature plays in human lives.

==Discovery and publication==
The only manuscript of the &quot;Tale&quot;, claimed to be dated to the 15th century, was discovered in 1795 in the library of the Transfiguration Monastery in Yaroslavl, where the first library and school in Russia had been established in the 12th century, but there is a controversy about its source. Monastery superior Joel (Bykovsky) sold the manuscript to a local landowner, Aleksei Musin-Pushkin, as a part of a collection of ten texts. Aleksei realised the value of the book and made a transcription for the empress Catherine the Great in 1795 or 1796. He published it in 1800 with the help of Alexei Malinovsky and Nikolai Bantysh-Kamensky, leading Russian paleographers of the time. The original manuscript was claimed to have burned in the great Moscow fire of 1812 (during the Napoleonic occupation), together with Musin-Pushkin&#x27;s entire library.

The release of this historical work into scholarly circulation created a stir in Russian literary circles, as the tale represented the earliest Slavonic language writing, without any element of Church Slavonic. After linguistic analysis, Ukrainian scholars in the Austrian Empire declared that the document contained transitional language between a) earlier fragments of the language of &quot;Rus&#x27; propria&quot; (the region of Chernigov, eastward through Kiev, and into Halych) and, b) later fragments from the Halych-Volynian era of this same region in the centuries immediately following the writing of the document.

The Russian-American author Vladimir Nabokov translated the work into English in 1960. Other notable editions include the standard Soviet edition, prepared with an extended commentary, by the academician Dmitry Likhachev.

==Authenticity debate==

According to the majority view, the poem is a composition of the late 12th century, perhaps composed orally and fixed in written form at some point during the 13th century. Some scholars consider the possibility that the poem in its current form is a national Romanticist compilation and rearrangement of several authentic sources. The thesis of the poem&#x27;s being a complete forgery has been proposed in the past but is widely discredited; the poem&#x27;s language has been demonstrated to be closer to authentic medieval East Slavic than practicable by a late 18th-century forger. It was not until 1951 that scholars discovered ancient birch bark documents with content in this medieval language.
One of the crucial points of the authenticity controversy is the relationship between The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign and &quot;Zadonschina&quot;, an unquestionably authentic poem, which was created around the end of the 1300s or the beginning of the 1400s to glorify Dmitri Donskoi&#x27;s victory over Mongol-Tatar troops of the ruler in the Golden Horde Mamai in the Battle of Kulikovo and is preserved in six medieval copies. There are almost identical passages in both texts where only the personal names are different. The traditional point of view considers &quot;Zadonschina&quot; to be a late imitation, with &quot;Slovo&quot; as its pattern. The forgery version claims the reverse: that &quot;Igor&#x27;s Tale&quot; was written using &quot;Zadonschina&quot; as a source. Recently, Roman Jakobson&#x27;s and Andrey Zaliznyak&#x27;s analyses show that the passages of &quot;Zadonschina&quot; with counterparts in &quot;Slovo&quot; differ from the rest of the text by several linguistic parameters, whereas this is not so for &quot;Igor&#x27;s Tale&quot;. This fact is taken as evidence of &quot;Slovo&quot; being the original with respect to &quot;Zadonschina&quot;. Zaliznyak also points out that the passages in &quot;Zadonschina&quot; which parallel those in the &quot;Igor&#x27;s Tale&quot; but differ from it can be explained only if &quot;Slovo&quot; was the source for &quot;Zadonshchina&quot; (the differences can be the result of the distortion of the original &quot;Slovo&quot; text by the author and different editors of &quot;Zadonshchina&quot; versions), but not vice versa.

Proponents of the forgery thesis give sometimes contradictory arguments: some authors (Mazon) see numerous &quot;Gallicisms&quot; in the text; while others (Trost, Haendler) see Germanisms, yet others (Keenan) Bohemisms. Zimin is certain that the author could only be Ioil Bykovsky, while Keenan is equally sure that only Josef Dobrovsky could be the falsifier.

Current dialectology upholds Pskov and Polotsk as the two cities where the &quot;Tale&quot; was most likely written. Numerous persons have been proposed as its authors, including Prince Igor and his brothers. Other authors consider the epic to have emerged in Southern Rus&#x27;, with many elements corresponding to modern Ukrainian language.

===Early reactions===
After the only manuscript copy of the &quot;Tale&quot; was destroyed in the Napoleonic invasion of 1812, questions about its authenticity were raised, mostly because of its language. Suspicion was also fueled by contemporary fabrications (for example, the &quot;Songs of Ossian&quot;, proved to be written by James Macpherson). Today, majority opinion accepts the authenticity of the text, based on the similarity of its language and imagery with those of other texts discovered after the &quot;Tale&quot;.

Proposed as forgers were Aleksei Musin-Pushkin, or the Russian manuscript forgers Anton Bardin and Alexander Sulakadzev. (Bardin was publicly exposed as the forger of four copies of &quot;Slovo&quot;). Josef Sienkowski, a journalist and Orientalist, was one of the notable early proponents of the falsification theory.

===Soviet period===

The problem of the national text became more politicized during the years of the Soviet Union. Any attempts to question the authenticity of &quot;Slovo&quot; (for example, by the French Slavist André Mazon or by the Russian historian Alexander Zimin) were condemned. Government officials also repressed and condemned non-standard interpretations based on Turkic lexis, such as was proposed by Olzhas Suleimenov (who considered &quot;Igor&#x27;s Tale&quot; to be an authentic text). Mazon&#x27;s and Zimin&#x27;s views were opposed, for example, by Roman Jakobson.

In 1975, Olzhas Suleimenov challenged the mainstream view of the &quot;Tale&quot; in his book &quot;Az i Ya&quot;. He claimed to reveal that &quot;Tale&quot; cannot be completely authentic since it appeared to have been rewritten in the 16th century.

Mainstream Slavists, including Dmitri Likhachev, and Turkologists criticized &quot;Az i Ya&quot;, characterizing Suleimenov&#x27;s etymological and paleography conjectures as amateurish. Linguists such as Zaliznyak pointed out that certain linguistic elements in &quot;Slovo&quot; dated from the 15th or 16th centuries, when the copy of the original manuscript (or of a copy) had been made. They noted this was a normal feature of copied documents, as copyists introduce elements of their own orthography and grammar, as is known from many other manuscripts. Zaliznyak points out that this evidence constitutes another argument for the authenticity of &quot;Slovo&quot;. An anonymous forger would have had not only to imitate very complex 12th century orthography and grammar but also to introduce fake complex traces of the copying in the 15th or 16th centuries.

===Recent views===

While some historians and philologists continue to question the text&#x27;s authenticity for various reasons (for example, believing that it has an uncharacteristically modern nationalistic sentiment) (Omeljan Pritsak inter alios), linguists are not so skeptical. The overall scholarly consensus accepts Slovo&#x27;s authenticity.

Some scholars believe the &quot;Tale&quot; has a purpose similar to that of Kralovedvorsky Manuscript. For instance, the Harvard historian Edward L. Keenan says in his article, &quot;Was Iaroslav of Halych really shooting sultans in 1185?&quot; and in his book &quot;Josef Dobrovsky and the Origins of the Igor&#x27;s Tale&quot; (2003), that &quot;Igor&#x27;s Tale&quot; is a fake, written by the Czech scholar Josef Dobrovský.

Other scholars contend that it is a recompilation and manipulation of several authentic sources put together similarly to Lönnrot&#x27;s &quot;Kalevala&quot;.

In his 2004 book, the Russian linguist Andrey Zaliznyak analyzes arguments and concludes that the forgery theory is virtually impossible. It was not until the late 20th century, after hundreds of bark documents were unearthed in Novgorod, that scholars learned that some of the puzzling passages and words of the &quot;tale&quot; were part of common speech in the 12th century, although they were not represented in chronicles and other formal written documents. Zaliznyak concludes that no 18th-century scholar could have imitated the subtle grammatical and syntactical features in the known text. He did not believe that Dobrovský could have accomplished this, as his views on Slavic grammar (as expressed in his magnum opus, &quot;Institutiones&quot;) were strikingly different from the system written in &quot;Igor&#x27;s Tale&quot;. In his revised second edition issued in 2007, Zaliznyak was able to use evidence from the posthumous edition of Zimin&#x27;s 2006 book. He argued that even someone striving to imitate some older texts would have had almost impossible hurdles to overcome, as mere imitation could not have represented the deep mechanics of the language.

Juri Lotman supports the text&#x27;s authenticity, based on the absence of a number of semiotic elements in the Russian Classicist literary tradition before the publication of the &quot;Tale&quot;. He notes that &quot;Russian Land&quot; (&quot;русская земля&quot;) was a term that became popular only in the 19th century. A presumed forger of the 1780s–1790s would not have used such a term while composing the text.

==Orality==
Robert Mann (1989, 2005) argues that the leading studies have been mistaken in concluding the &quot;Tale&quot; is the work of a poet working in a written tradition. Mann points to evidence suggesting that the &quot;Tale&quot; first circulated as an oral epic song for several decades before being written down, most likely in the early 13th century. He identifies the opening lines as corresponding to such an oral tradition: &quot;Was it not fitting, brothers, to begin with the olden words of the heroic tales about the campaign of Igor...&quot; The narrator begins by referring to oral epic tales that are already old and familiar. Mann has found numerous new parallels to the text of the &quot;Tale&quot; in wedding songs, magical incantations, &quot;byliny&quot; and other Old Russian sources. He was the first researcher to point out unique textual parallels in a rare version of the &quot;Tale of the Battle against Mamai&quot; (&quot;Skazanie o Mamaevom poboishche&quot;), published by N.G. Golovin in 1835. It contains what Mann claims is the earliest known redaction of the &quot;Skazanie&quot;, a redaction that scholars posited but could not locate.

Based on byliny and Old Russian sources, Mann has attempted to reconstruct an early Russian song about the conversion of the Kievan State. Mann believes that this early conversion cycle left its imprint on several passages of the &quot;Tale&quot;, including the motif sequence in which the pagan Div warns the Tmutorokan idol that Igor&#x27;s army is approaching.

<text>Lighthouse Design Ltd. was an American software company that operated from 1989 to 1996. Lighthouse developed software for NeXT computers running the NeXTSTEP operating system. The company was founded in 1989 by Alan Chung, Roger Rosner, Jonathan Schwartz, Kevin Steele and Brian Skinner, in Bethesda, Maryland. Lighthouse later moved to San Mateo, California. In 1996, Lighthouse was acquired by Sun Microsystems.

==History==
Two of the first products developed at Lighthouse were Diagram! and Exploder.

Diagram! was a drawing tool, originally called BLT (for Box-and-Line Tool) in which objects (boxes) are connected together using &quot;smart links&quot; (lines) to construct diagrams such a flow charts.

Exploder was a programming tool for storing Objective-C objects in a relational database. Lighthouse marketed Diagram! directly, and in 1991 spun off the Exploder into a new startup, Persistence Software. Persistence Software went public with an IPO on June 25, 1999.

Lighthouse went on to develop and acquire more software products, and marketed an office suite for NeXTSTEP, which included ParaSheet (a traditional spreadsheet), Quantrix (a spreadsheet program based on Lotus Improv), Diagram!, TaskMaster (a project management program), WetPaint (an image editing/retouching program), LightPlan (an OMT-based computer data modeling tool, based on Diagram!), and Concurrence (a presentation program).

In the early 1990s, Sun Microsystems entered a major partnership with NeXT to develop OpenStep, essentially a cross-platform version of the &quot;upper layers&quot; of the NeXTSTEP operating system. OpenStep would provide a NeXT-like system running on top of any suitably powerful underlying operating system, in Sun&#x27;s case, Solaris. Sun planned a distributed computing environment, with users running OpenStep on the desktop, and the transaction processing occurring on servers in the back-office. The two would communicate with NeXT&#x27;s Portable Distributed Objects technology, which was known as Distributed Objects Everywhere (DOE), later released as NEO.

In mid-1996, Sun purchased Lighthouse for $22 million, turning them into their in-house OpenStep applications group. At the time, Scott McNealy had visions of turning Sun into a powerhouse that would compete head-to-head with Microsoft, and an office applications suite was a requirement for any such plan. Lighthouse&#x27;s applications were not up to par with Microsoft Office as a whole, but certainly could have been developed into a direct competitor with additional development.

But even as the purchase of Lighthouse was going through, Sun was already turning their attention from DOE/NEO on the back-end and OpenStep on the front-end to &quot;Java everywhere&quot;. Java was seen as a better solution to infiltrating Sun into the applications market, as it ran on all platforms, not just those supported by OpenStep. Lighthouse was soon moved into the JavaSoft division, becoming the Java Applications Group.

The only problem with this move was that any attempt to port Lighthouse&#x27;s OpenStep applications written in Objective-C to Java would be almost impossible. Additionally, Sun was worried that releasing their own suite would make third party developers less interested in the platform (see Claris) as they would have to compete with Sun directly in the office application space. Some attempts were made: LightPlan was ported to Java and released as JavaPlan (and also switched from OMT to UML). Sun eventually gave up on the idea, if it ever entertained it seriously in the first place, abandoning the office application market for many years.

Later, OmniGroup cloned Diagram! as OmniGraffle, which conceptually operates in much the same way as Diagram! and the original BLT.

It was not until 1999 that Sun once again entered this market. Oddly, it did so not with a Java suite, but by purchasing the C++-based StarOffice suite. According to Jonathan Schwartz, the former chief executive officer of Lighthouse, the Lighthouse application suite will probably never again be offered to the public.

Lighthouse co-founder Schwartz continued to move up through the ranks at Sun, becoming the head of its software division in 2002, and in April 2006 was named Sun&#x27;s CEO and President.

<doc id="472377" wikidata="Q4649643" url="?curid=472377" title="A83 road">
<text>The A83 is a major road in the south of Argyll and Bute, Scotland, running from Tarbet, on the western shore of Loch Lomond, where it splits from the A82, to Campbeltown at the southern end of the Kintyre peninsula. The road is best known for its section across the Rest and be Thankful pass through the Arrochar Alps between the heads of Loch Long and Loch Fyne.

==Route==
From Tarbet the A83 runs west across the watershed between Loch Lomond and Loch Long to Arrochar near the head of Loch Long. It then goes round the head of the loch, and along the western shore for a short distance, before turning northwest through the Rest and be Thankful mountain pass through Glen Croe in the Arrochar Alps, from the shore of Loch Long to that of Loch Fyne. It was near this spot that an RAF Tornado crashed on 2 July 2009.

The words &quot;REST &amp; BE THANKFUL&quot; are inscribed on a stone near the junction of the A83 and the B828, placed there by soldiers who built the original military road in 1753, now referred to as the &quot;Drovers&#x27; Road&quot;. The original stone fell into ruin and was replaced by a commemorative stone at the same site.

The section is so named as the climb out of Glen Croe is so long and steep at the end that it was customary for travellers to rest at the top, and be thankful for having reached the highest point. The current road no longer keeps to the floor of Glen Croe but steadily climbs across the southern slopes of Beinn Luibhean, on the north side of the Glen, to the highest point of the pass. The westward descent to Loch Fyne is through Glen Kinglas. At Cairndow the A815, the main road down the Cowal peninsula, branches off south to Dunoon and finally Toward at the A815 road end, both on the Firth of Clyde.

On reaching the shore of Loch Fyne, the A83 follows the eastern shore of the loch northwards to its head and then goes south west along the western shore through Inveraray and then on to Lochgilphead and Ardrishaig, where it crosses the entrance to the Crinan Canal.

From Ardrishaig the road continues south to Tarbert, where it crosses over to the western shore of the Kintyre peninsula. In the final section it passes through the villages of Whitehouse, Clachan, Tayinloan, Muasdale and Bellochantuy before finally crossing back to the east of the peninsula, on the Firth of Clyde coast, as it approaches Campbeltown.

==Rest and Be Thankful closures==
The stretch south of the &quot;Rest and Be Thankful&quot; junction has been closed on a number of occasions due to landslides, causing significant disruption to local traffic. The closure results in a 59-mile (93 km) diversion via Crianlarich when the military road is also affected. The many communities affected by the closures of the trunk road are campaigning for a permanent solution to be constructed by Transport Scotland. Suggestions include a rock shed, so future slips flow over the trunk road, and a new road route.

Transport Scotland has, in recent years, spent £80m on landslip prevention schemes, none of which has improved the situation on the trunk road. The many wire slip capture nets and supporting cables have failed on many occasions and some have criticised these, saying they blight the picturesque area.

* The trunk road was closed here due to a 400 tonne landslide on 28 October 2007. The road was partially reopened on Monday 10 November.
* A 1,070 tonne landslide closed the trunk road around noon on 8 September 2009. The road reopened at 15.00 on 10 September 2009.
* A landslip on 1 December 2011 closed the trunk road for 24 hours.
* Another landslip closed the trunk road from 22 February 2012, and an even more substantial landslip in August 2012 resulted in further major delays and closures.
* On 3 October 2013, the trunk road was reopened at 17.30, having been closed between the A815 and the B828 since the previous night.
* On 30 December 2015, Storm Frank caused a 200 tonne landslide; two cars were caught up in the debris but no one was harmed. The trunk road reopened the following afternoon.
* The A83 trunk road closed again for a period of nine days in October 2018, in response to landslides triggered during the start of Storm Callum.
* In August 2020 a landslip happened as the area experienced heavy rains, again closing the trunk road.
* In September 2020, after being re-opened for only five days, a further landslip happened as the area again experienced heavy rains, closing the trunk road.
*In October 2023, after heavy rain, the A83 was closed after seven separate landslides. The road was closed for five days. Ten people were airlifted by helicopter, after becoming trapped between landslips while traveling on the road.

Landslides have become increasingly frequent in recent years despite remediation efforts. In March 2020 Transport Scotland said it was investing in the further construction of catch pits which it hoped would mitigate against landslides along the A83 trunk road route. A 10-year woodland creation project is currently in progress; it is thought that the subsequent ground stabilisation will help prevent further landslides.

In March 2022, Transport Scotland shortlisted five consultants to design a long-term solution to landslip problems on the A83 at Rest and Be Thankful. Five options including tunnelling are being considered. Transport Scotland has looked at Norway&#x27;s processes and methods for developing and constructing tunnelling projects to deal with conditions similar to those at Rest and Be Thankful.

<text>Bruce Bernard Weatherill, Baron Weatherill, (25 November 1920 – 6 May 2007) was a British Conservative Party politician. He served as Speaker of the House of Commons between 1983 and 1992.

==Background==
Born in Sunningdale in 1920, he was the son of Annie Gertrude () and Bernard Bruce Weatherill. He married Lyn Eatwell in 1949 and they had three children. Weatherill was known as &quot;Jack&quot;, while his twin sister (baptismal name Margery) was called &quot;Jill&quot;.

==Tailor==

After attending Malvern College, he was apprenticed at age 17 as a tailor to the family firm Bernard Weatherill Ltd, Sporting Tailors, later of 5 Savile Row. He became Director (1948), Managing Director (1958), and Chairman (1967) of the business. After it merged with Kilgour French &amp; Stanbury Ltd., Tailors in 1969, he became Chairman of the combined firm. He resumed his role with the company after his retirement from the House of Commons in 1992, as president until the firm was acquired by others in 2003. Some of the clothes he designed are in the Victoria and Albert Museum and other museum collections.

Following his mother&#x27;s advice, he always carried his tailoring thimble in his pocket as a reminder of his trade origins and the need for humility, no matter how high one rises. He said that he desired his epitaph to be &quot;He always kept his word.&quot;

He was a member of three City of London Livery Companies: the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors, the Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths, and the Worshipful Company of Gold and Silver Wyre Drawers. He became a Freeman of the City of London in 1949, and of the London Borough of Croydon in 1983.

==British Army==
Weatherill enlisted as a private in the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry of the British Army a few days after the start of World War II. He was commissioned into the 4th/7th Dragoon Guards in May 1941 and reached the rank of captain in 1943. He was attached to 19th King George V&#x27;s Own Lancers, Indian Army, after being posted to Burma.

While on active service, Weatherill spent time in Bengal, where he embraced the local culture, including learning Urdu and taking up meditation. In response to having witnessed the Bengal famine of 1943, he became a vegetarian.

Weatherill was discharged from the Army in 1946, having served for seven years.

==Member of Parliament==
He was elected Member of Parliament (MP) on 15 October 1964 for Croydon North East as a Conservative. He became a party whip three years later, and deputy Chief Whip six years after that. He was re-elected seven times for the same seat until his retirement in 1992.

From October 1971 to April 1973, Weatherill was Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty&#x27;s Household, an office usually held by a Government whip, as Weatherill then was. He wrote a letter (hand-carried by messenger, or sent by telegram) to the Queen at the end of each day the House of Commons met, describing the debates, reactions, and political gossip. His letters are believed to have been more entertaining than the debates themselves. Weatherill is the most recent Speaker to have served in Government prior to the Speakership; his successors have all been longtime backbench MPs.

In 1979, Weatherill played a critical role in the defeat of the Labour government in a vote of confidence. As the vote loomed, Labour&#x27;s deputy Chief Whip, Walter Harrison, approached Weatherill to enforce the convention and Gentlemen&#x27;s agreement (otherwise known as pairing) that if a sick MP from the Government could not vote, an MP from the Opposition would abstain to compensate. Labour MP Alfred Broughton was on his deathbed and could not vote, meaning the Government would probably lose by one vote. Weatherill said that the convention had never been intended for such a critical vote that meant the life or death of the Government and it would be impossible to find a Conservative MP who would agree to abstain. However, after a moment&#x27;s reflection, he offered that he would abstain, because he felt it would be dishonourable to break his word to Harrison. Harrison was so impressed by Weatherill&#x27;s offer (which would have effectively ended his political career) that he released Weatherill from his obligation, and the Government fell by one vote.

He was sworn of the Privy Council on 8 January 1980.

==Speaker of the House of Commons==
He was Speaker of the House of Commons from 1983 to 1992. As Speaker at the time television cameras were first allowed to cover proceedings in the House of Commons, he became widely known due to broadcasts of Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions.

He was the last Speaker to wear a wig while in the chair. He commented that the wig is a wonderful device that allows the Speaker to pretend not to hear some things. He enforced the rights of Parliament to be publicly told of government policies before they were announced to the press or elsewhere. A portrait of him by Robin-Lee Hall hangs in Portcullis House.

==Life peer==
He stood down in 1992, and was made a life peer on 15 July 1992 taking the title Baron Weatherill, of North East Croydon in the London Borough of Croydon. As is customary for former Speakers, the government put before the House of Commons an address to the Queen, asking that Weatherill be appointed a peer as a mark of &quot;royal favour&quot;. Given a rare opportunity to discuss constitutional arrangements relating to the monarch and the Upper House, left-wing members of Parliament forced a debate on the petition.

He sat in the House of Lords as a crossbencher, the convention for former Speakers, irrespective of their previous party affiliation.

In 1993, he was elected alternate Convenor of the Crossbench Peers, and was a convenor from 1995 until 1999. In the House of Lords he made a major contribution to the House of Lords Act 1999 by stitching together the compromise that allowed a limited number of hereditary peers to remain as members.

In 2006, he became Patron of the Better Off Out campaign, calling for Britain to leave the European Union.

==Later life==
In 1989, he succeeded Lord Blake as High Bailiff and Searcher of the Sanctuary of Westminster Abbey. He resigned both of those offices at the end of 1998 in protest at the manner in which the Dean and Chapter dealt with terminating the employment of the organist. He was succeeded by Roy Strong.

He was Vice-Chancellor of the British charitable Order of St John from 1983 to 2000, and was a knight of the Order from 1992.

An Urdu speaker, he was decorated with the &quot;Hilal-i-Pakistan&quot; (Crescent of Pakistan, second class) by the Government of Pakistan in 1993.

In 1994, he was named a deputy lieutenant of Kent.

He was a member of the European Reform Forum.

Weatherill was an advocate of vegetarianism and appeared at the first Vegetarian Rally in Hyde Park, London in 1990, alongside Tony Benn. He once stated, &quot;as a lifelong vegetarian I believe that since man cannot give life he has no moral right to take it away&quot;.

In 2005, he announced he was suffering from prostate cancer. On 6 May 2007, he died from cancer at the Marie Curie Community Hospice in Caterham, Surrey, aged 86.

Bernard Weatherill House, council offices in Croydon, is named after him.

<text>Per Yngve &quot;Pelle&quot; Ohlin (16 January 1969 – 8 April 1991), known professionally as Dead, was a Swedish musician who was best known as the lead vocalist and lyricist of the Norwegian black metal band Mayhem from 1988 until his death in 1991. Prior to Mayhem, he performed as the vocalist in the Swedish death/thrash band Morbid. Dead was a popular figure of the Norwegian black metal scene, and his legacy persists in the genre to this day. Roadrunner Records ranked him No. 48 out of 50 of &quot;The Greatest Metal Front-Men of All Time&quot;.

Dead was known for his morbid personality and obsession with death. He hoarded dead birds, wore shirts with funeral announcements printed on them and wore corpse paint—being one of the first in black metal to do so. Acquaintances and peers described Ohlin as difficult to befriend or understand. Already intensely introverted and depressed, Dead&#x27;s personality and demeanor would only become more withdrawn leading up to his death, a progression marked by such patterns as harming himself offstage among friends and isolating himself for long periods in his bedroom.

Dead died by suicide in April 1991 at the age of 22. An image of his cadaver was used as the cover for the unofficially released live album &quot;The Dawn of the Black Hearts&quot; (1995).

==Early life==
Per Yngve Ohlin (sometimes called &quot;Pelle&quot;) was born on 16 January 1969 in Västerhaninge, Stockholm County, Sweden, to parents Anita Forsberg and Lars Ohlin, who divorced soon after his birth. As a young child, Ohlin suffered from sleep apnea. At the age of ten, he suffered internal bleeding when his spleen ruptured after what he claimed was an ice skating accident. However, in the Swedish metal book &quot;Blod eld död&quot; (English: &quot;Blood Fire Death&quot;), his brother Anders stated in an exclusive interview that Dead was frequently bullied in school and one day sustained a ruptured spleen as a direct result of a severe beating by bullies. Because of the injury, Ohlin had to be rushed to a hospital, where he was, for a time, declared clinically dead. After a few years, the incident resulted in a fascination with death, and later inspired his stage name.

As a teenager, Ohlin developed a taste for heavy metal and rock music, citing bands like Black Sabbath, Kiss, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, AC/DC, Motörhead, Venom, Metallica, Bathory, Sodom and Mercyful Fate as his favourites. Despite his love for Bathory, he was very displeased after their change in musical style and consequently referred to Quorthon as &quot;a wimp&quot;.

==Career==
===Morbid and Mayhem===
In early 1986, Ohlin founded the Swedish death/thrash metal group Morbid, with which he recorded a demo tape called &quot;December Moon&quot;. Disappointed that the band wasn&#x27;t &quot;going anywhere&quot;, he decided to contact members of Mayhem as he was aware the group were in need of a new frontman following vocalist Maniac&#x27;s departure. According to Mayhem bassist Jørn &quot;Necrobutcher&quot; Stubberud, Dead initially sent the band members a small parcel containing a demo tape, a letter detailing his ideas for the future and a crucified mouse. Although Necrobutcher lost the package itself, he kept the tape which had Dead&#x27;s contact details. At that point, Dead moved to Norway in early 1988 and became the new official vocalist for Mayhem.

===Performances===

For concerts, Dead went to great lengths to achieve the image and atmosphere he wished. From the beginning of his career, he wore &quot;corpse paint&quot;, which involved covering his face with black and white makeup. According to Necrobutcher, &quot;[i]t wasn&#x27;t anything to do with the way Kiss and Alice Cooper used makeup. Dead actually wanted to look like a corpse. He didn&#x27;t do it to look cool&quot;. Mayhem drummer Jan Axel &quot;Hellhammer&quot; Blomberg claimed that Dead &quot;was the first black metal musician to use corpse paint&quot;, although this statement has been proven to be debatable as Mayhem guitarist Øystein &quot;Euronymous&quot; Aarseth can be seen wearing corpse paint in live footage as early as 1985. To complete his corpse-like image, Dead would bury his stage clothes and dig them up again to wear on the night of a concert. According to Hellhammer: &quot;Before the shows, Dead used to bury his clothes into the ground so that they could start to rot and get that grave scent. He was a corpse on a stage... Once he even asked us to bury &quot;him&quot; in the ground — he wanted his skin to become pale.&quot;

During one tour with Mayhem, Dead found a dead crow and kept it in a plastic bag. He often carried it with him and would smell the bird before going onstage, to sing &quot;with the stench of death in his nostrils.&quot; He would also collect dead geese and keep them underneath his bed.

Dead would cut himself while singing onstage. During a gig in Jessheim on February 3, 1990, he slashed his arm with a broken bottle. Emperor drummer Bård Guldvik &quot;Faust&quot; Eithun claims that Dead had to be taken to hospital after the gig, but arrived too late and so &quot;it was no use to give him stitches&quot;.

In an interview conducted by Marduk guitarist Morgan Håkansson and published in the fanzine &quot;Slayer&quot;, Dead explained how he and the rest of Mayhem would expel poseurs at their concerts. Reciting the events of one particular show, he claimed, &quot;Before we began to play there was a crowd of about 300 in there, but in the second song &#x27;Necrolust&#x27; we began to throw around those pig heads. Only 50 were left.&quot; He and the other members enjoyed this sort of practice; he concluded with, &quot;If someone doesn&#x27;t like blood and rotten flesh thrown in their face they can FUCK OFF, and that&#x27;s exactly what they do.&quot;

Dead made a brief appearance in the 1986 music video for Candlemass&#x27; &quot;Bewitched&quot;.

==Personality==
In interviews, fellow musicians often described Dead as odd and introverted. Hellhammer described Dead as &quot;a very strange personality […] depressed, melancholic and dark.&quot; Likewise, Euronymous once said, &quot;I honestly think Dead is mentally insane. Which other way can you describe a guy who does not eat, in order to get starving wounds? Or who has a T-shirt with funeral announcements on it?&quot; Former Mayhem drummer Kjetil Manheim later likened Dead&#x27;s personality to that of Marvin the Paranoid Android. Some authors have speculated that Dead may have had Cotard&#x27;s syndrome, a very rare condition that manifests in believing one&#x27;s body is not that of a living human but instead a corpse.

According to Faust: &quot;[Dead] wasn&#x27;t a guy you could know very well. I think even the other guys in Mayhem didn&#x27;t know him very well. He was hard to get close to. I met him two weeks before he died. I&#x27;d met him maybe six to eight times, in all. He had lots of weird ideas. I remember Aarseth was talking about him and said he did not have any humor. He did, but it was very obscure. Honestly, I don&#x27;t think he was enjoying living in this world, which of course resulted in the suicide.&quot;
Stian &quot;Occultus&quot; Johannsen, who briefly took over as vocalist after Dead&#x27;s suicide, remarked that Dead did not even possess a normal perception of himself: &quot;He [Dead] didn&#x27;t see himself as human; he saw himself as a creature from another world. He said he had many visions that his blood has frozen in his veins, that he was dead. That is the reason he took that name. He knew he would die.&quot;

According to a longtime pen pal known as &quot;Old Nick&quot;, Ohlin disliked technology. He would only ever write letters to himself or others using style and would never resort to the use of a personal computer. Old Nick concluded &quot;technology in general made him [feel] uncomfortable. He just rejected it altogether, finding refuge [instead] in a world made of forests and woodlands.&quot; Dead also had an unusual interest with porphyria due to its connection to the mythology of vampirism. In his letters, Dead expressed a fascination with the occult, even stating that his great grandmother practiced white magic before. Dead stated that for a time, specifically to better understand his near death experience, he had attempted before to perform his own rituals but was ultimately unsuccessful in his practices.

==Self-harm and suicide==

In time, Dead&#x27;s social situation and his fixation on death caused his mental state to worsen greatly. He would casually cut himself while in the presence of his friends, who would have to subdue him and treat his wounds. Although this upset many of his friends, Euronymous grew fascinated with Dead&#x27;s suicidal ideologies because he felt extreme negativity fit Mayhem&#x27;s image—and according to them, he encouraged Dead to kill himself. Manheim said: &quot;I don&#x27;t know if Øystein did it out of pure evil or if he was just fooling around.&quot;

By 1991, Dead, Euronymous and Hellhammer were living in a house in the woods near Kråkstad, which was used as a place for the band to rehearse. According to Hellhammer, Dead spent much of his time writing letters and drawing. He &quot;just sat in his room and became more and more depressed.&quot; Necrobutcher said that, after living together for a while, Dead and Euronymous &quot;got on each other&#x27;s nerves a lot.&quot; Hellhammer recalls an anecdote where Dead once retreated outside to sleep in the woods because Euronymous was playing synth music that Dead hated. Euronymous followed and began shooting into the air with a shotgun to further antagonize him. Varg Vikernes of Burzum claims that Dead once stabbed Euronymous with a knife during an altercation. Vikernes also claims to have sent Mayhem ammunition, including shotgun shells, as a Christmas gift, although he claimed those were not the shells Dead used to kill himself, and that he instead saved a &quot;special shell&quot; particularly to be used for his suicide.

On 8 April 1991, while left alone in the house, Dead used a hunting knife to slit his wrists and throat and, afterward, shot himself in the forehead with a shotgun. He left a brief suicide note which started with the line, &quot;Excuse the blood...&quot;. His body was found by Euronymous, who had to climb through an open window as the doors were locked and there were no other keys to the house. Instead of calling the police immediately, Euronymous visited a nearby shop to purchase a disposable camera with which he photographed the body; after re-arranging some items for his pictures, he proceeded to call emergency services. 

Dead&#x27;s suicide caused a rift between Euronymous and some of his friends, who were disgusted by his attitude towards Dead before the suicide, and his behavior about Dead&#x27;s death afterwards. Necrobutcher ended his friendship with Euronymous and left Mayhem. Manheim later speculated that Euronymous had willfully left Dead alone in the house so that he would have a chance to kill himself. Dead&#x27;s suicide was said to cause &quot;a change in mentality&quot; in the black metal scene and was the first in a string of infamous events carried out by its members.

An obituary in a Swedish newspaper stated that Dead&#x27;s funeral was held at on Friday 26 April 1991. He was buried at Österhaninge cemetery in Stockholm County.

==Aftermath and legacy==
Euronymous used Dead&#x27;s suicide to foster Mayhem&#x27;s &quot;evil&quot; image and claimed Dead had killed himself because black metal had become &quot;trendy&quot; and commercialized. Necrobutcher speculated that taking the pictures and forcing others to see them was a way for Euronymous to cope with the shock of seeing his friend&#x27;s body. After Hellhammer developed the photos, Euronymous initially promised to destroy them but ultimately did not. He stored them in an envelope at his record shop and sent one to the owner of Warmaster Records, which resulted in its use as cover art for the bootleg live album &quot;The Dawn of the Black Hearts&quot; (1995). The cover of Mayhem&#x27;s &quot;Live in Leipzig&quot; contains part of Dead&#x27;s suicide note: &quot;Jag är inte en människa. Det här är bara en dröm, och snart vaknar jag.&quot; (Roughly translated: &quot;I am not a human being. This is just a dream, and soon I will wake.&quot;) Necrobutcher was deeply disturbed by Euronymous&#x27; actions and behavior following Dead&#x27;s death, and is quoted saying &quot;I might punch you in the face if you wear [the photo of Dead&#x27;s corpse] on a T-shirt.&quot;

In time, rumors spread that Euronymous had made a stew with bits of Dead&#x27;s brain and had made necklaces with bits of his skull. The band later denied the former rumor, but confirmed that the latter was true. Moreover, Euronymous claimed to have given these necklaces to musicians he deemed worthy, which was confirmed by several other members of the scene, like Faust, Håkansson and Metalion.

Necrobutcher noted that &quot;people became more aware of the black metal scene after Dead had shot himself ... I think it was Dead&#x27;s suicide that really changed the scene&quot;.

<text>Joseph Baermann Strauss (January 9, 1870 – May 16, 1938) was a German-American structural engineer who revolutionized the design of bascule bridges. He was the chief engineer of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California.

==Life, beginnings and death==
He was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, to an artistic family of German-Jewish ancestry. His mother was a pianist, and his father, Raphael Strauss, was a writer and painter. He graduated from the University of Cincinnati in 1892 with a degree in civil engineering. He served as both class poet and president, and was a brother of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.

Strauss had many hobbies, including poetry. After completion of the Golden Gate Bridge he returned to his passion of poetry and wrote his most recognizable poem &quot;The Mighty Task is Done&quot;. He also wrote &quot;The Redwoods&quot;, and his &quot;Sequoia&quot; can still be purchased by tourists visiting the California redwoods.

He died in Los Angeles, California one year after the Golden Gate&#x27;s completion. His statue can be seen on the San Francisco side of the bridge. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale.

==Early career and the bascule bridge==
Strauss was hospitalized while in college and his hospital room overlooked the John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge. This sparked his interest in bridges. Upon graduating from the University of Cincinnati, Strauss worked at the office of Ralph Modjeski, a firm which specialized in building bridges. At that time, bascule bridges were built with expensive iron counterweights. He proposed using cheaper concrete counterweights in place of iron. When his ideas were rejected, he left the firm and started his own firm, the Strauss Bascule Bridge Company of Chicago, where he revolutionized the design of bascule bridges.

==Bridge designs==
Strauss was the designer of the Burnside Bridge (1926) in Portland, Oregon, and the Lewis and Clark Bridge (1930) over the Columbia River between Longview, Washington, and Rainier, Oregon. Strauss also worked with the Dominion Bridge Company in building the Cherry Street Strauss Trunnion Bascule Bridge (1931) in Toronto, Ontario. In 1912 he designed the HB&amp;T Railway bascule bridge over Buffalo Bayou in Houston, Texas (now hidden under an Interstate 69 bridge in the shadow of downtown Houston). His design was also exported to Norway where Skansen Bridge (1918) is still in daily use. He also designed Palace Bridge (Dvortsovy) double-leaf Strauss bascule bridge over Neva River in St. Petersburg (then Petrograd), Russia near Winter Palace, former Czar&#x27;s residence. 

The Strauss bridge design was also copied and used in other places in Europe. Two bridges are still in daily use in Sweden - the railwaybridges over Trollhätte canal, in Vänersborg and Danviksbron in Stockholm. In Sête, France, over Canal du Midi, another copy of Strauss designed bridges is to be found.

===Golden Gate Bridge===
Strauss is credited as the chief engineer of the Golden Gate Bridge, but Charles Alton Ellis is responsible for most of the structural design. Because of a dispute with Strauss, however, Ellis was not recognized for his work when the bridge opened in 1937.
A plaque honoring Ellis was installed on the south tower in 2012, to acknowledge his contributions.

As chief engineer of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California, Strauss overcame many problems. He had to find funding and support for the bridge from the citizens and the U.S. military. There were also innovations in the way the bridge was constructed. It had to span one of the greatest distances ever spanned, reach heights that hadn&#x27;t been seen in a bridge, and hold up to the forces of the ocean. He placed a brick from the demolished McMicken Hall at his alma mater, the University of Cincinnati, in the south anchorage before the concrete was poured.

Strauss was concerned with the safety of his workers. He required that a net be installed beneath the Golden Gate Bridge during construction. This net saved a total of 19 lives.

<text>Josef Strauss (20 August 1827 – 22 July 1870) was an Austrian composer.

He was born in Mariahilf (now Vienna), the son of Johann Strauss I and Maria Anna Streim, and brother of Johann Strauss II and Eduard Strauss. His father wanted him to choose a career in the Austrian Habsburg military. He studied music with Franz Dolleschal and learned to play the violin with Franz Anton Ries.

He received training as an engineer, and worked for the city of Vienna as an engineer and designer. He designed a horse-drawn revolving brush street-sweeping vehicle and published two textbooks on mathematical subjects. Strauss had talents as an artist, painter, poet, dramatist, singer, composer and inventor.

== Family orchestra ==
He joined the family orchestra, along with his brothers, Johann Strauss II and Eduard Strauss in the 1850s. His first published work was called &quot;Die Ersten und Letzten&quot; (The First and the Last). When Johann became seriously ill in 1853 Josef led the orchestra for a while. The waltz-loving Viennese were appreciative of his early compositions so he decided to continue in the family tradition of composing dance music. He was known as &#x27;Pepi&#x27; by his family and close friends, and Johann once said of him: &quot;Pepi is the more gifted of us two; I am merely the more popular...&quot;

== Family life ==
Josef Strauss married Caroline Pruckmayer at the church of St. Johann Nepomuk in Vienna on 8 June 1857 and had one daughter, Karolina Anna, who was born on 27 March 1858.

== Music ==
Josef Strauss wrote 283 works with opus numbers. He wrote many waltzes, including: &quot;Sphären-Klänge&quot; (Music of the Spheres), &quot;Delirien&quot; (Deliriums), &quot;Transaktionen&quot; (Transactions), &quot;Mein Lebenslauf ist Lieb&#x27; und Lust&quot; (My Character is Love and Joy), and &quot;Dorfschwalben aus Österreich&quot; (Village Swallows from Austria), polkas, most famously the &quot;&quot; with his brother Johann, quadrilles, and other dance music, and also some marches. The waltz &quot;The Mysterious Powers of Magnetism&quot; (&quot;Dynamiden&quot;) with the use of minor keys showed a quality that distinguished his waltzes from those of his more popular elder brother. The polka-mazurka shows influence by Strauss, where he wrote many examples like &quot;Die Emancipierte&quot; and &quot;Die Libelle&quot;.

== Death ==
Josef Strauss was sick most of his later life. He was prone to fainting spells and intense headaches. During a tour in 1870, he fell unconscious from the conductor&#x27;s podium in Warsaw while conducting his &#x27;Musical Potpourri&#x27;, striking his head. His wife brought him back home to Vienna, to the &quot;Hirschenhaus&quot;, where he died on 22 July of that year. A final diagnosis cited only decomposed blood. There were rumors that he had been beaten by drunken Russian soldiers after allegedly refusing to perform for them one night. A specific cause of death was not determined, since his widow forbade any autopsy. Originally buried in the St. Marx Cemetery, Strauss was later exhumed and reburied in the Vienna Central Cemetery, alongside his mother Anna.

<text>Free the Slaves (FTS) is an international non-governmental organization and lobby group, established to campaign against the modern practice of slavery around the world. It was formed as the sister organization of Anti-Slavery International but has since become a separate entity and has no relationship with it. The organization was created as a result of research done by Kevin Bales in his book, &quot;Disposable People: New Slavery in the Global Economy&quot;.

==Programs==
Free the Slaves currently operates in India, Nepal, Ghana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Senegal, the Dominican Republic, and Brazil. The countries are targeted based on the prevalence of slavery. The organization gives &quot;Freedom Awards&quot; to honor people and organizations fighting to end slavery. Winners have included Veeru Kohli (2009) and Timea Nagy, 2012.

==Supporters==
Free the Slaves has worked with musicians such as Jason Mraz and Grammy Award winner Esperanza Spalding. Spalding performed a benefit concert for FTS in December 2012, featuring Bobby McFerrin, Gretchen Parlato, and a special guest appearance by Paul Simon. Spalding also raised money for the organization during her summer tour.

Other supporters over the years have included Carla Gugino, Vincent Kartheiser, Camilla Belle, Forest Whitaker, Demi Moore, and Ashton Kutcher.

==Criticism==
In response to Kevin Bales&#x27;s interview with &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; about Free The Slaves, investigative journalist Christian Parenti wrote a criticism of Bales claiming he had made false claims about the chocolate industry. Specifically, Parenti argues that
Bales goes around fund raising, flogging his book and promoting himself on the basis that he has successfully reformed the chocolate industry and largely halted its use of child labor in West Africa. But no such thing has happened ... Bales&#x27; organization FTS defended the chocolate industry when the Department of Labor sought to list cocoa as a product tainted by slave and child labor.

<doc id="472393" wikidata="Q4568509" url="?curid=472393" title="1955 doubled die cent">
<text>The 1955 doubled die cent is a die variety that occurred during production of the one cent coin at the United States Mint in 1955.

==Origins==
When a modern coin die is created, it is struck from a working hub, which places the incuse image onto the die that will subsequently be used to strike coins. Normally, this requires multiple blows. In 1955, one of the working obverse dies at the Philadelphia Mint was misaligned on the second blow from the working hub, thus resulting in a doubled image. Due to the manner in which this hubbing was carried out, it most noticeably affected the date and inscriptions, with very little doubling (albeit noticeable loss of detail) visible on the bust of Lincoln. These doubled features were visible on all of the coins struck from this die. It is estimated that 40,000 of these coins were minted, all during one night shift at the Philadelphia Mint. Roughly 20,000–24,000 of the pennies were introduced into circulation after the minting error.

The 1955 doubled die is one of the most famous die varieties in US coinage. Very few exist today in totally mint condition, as almost all were discovered while in circulation. Over the years, many counterfeits of this coin have surfaced. It is advised for collectors to seek expert opinion before purchasing one of these coins if it has not been certified by one of the top numismatic certification companies.

A seemingly similar variety to the 1955 doubled die is the so-called 1955 &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Doubled Die&quot; cent, created by die deterioration doubling. It is caused when the design on a worn die becomes eroded and distorted, causing part of the design (such as the final digit of the date) to appear doubled. It is much more common than the actual doubled die, and as such it sells for only a few dollars.

== In popular culture ==
A &quot;1955 doubled die Denver mint penny&quot; is a plot device in the American movie &quot;UHF&quot;; when R. J. Fletcher cruelly gives a penny to a beggar, the beggar realizes its value and uses the money earned from trading it in to save a local TV station that Fletcher was hoping to buy out. Although the Denver mint did produce some doubled die pennies in 1955, the doubling is not nearly as noticeable as the more famous Philadelphia variety.

The coin is mentioned in the 2010 Stephen King novella &quot;A Good Marriage.&quot;

<doc id="472394" wikidata="Q1122078" url="?curid=472394" title="Flag of Alberta">
<text>The flag of Alberta is an official symbol of the province of Alberta, Canada. In 1968, the provincial legislature authorized the design of a flag, adopting it on 1 June 1968.

The flag has the proportions 1:2, with the provincial coat of arms in the centre of an ultramarine blue background. The shield&#x27;s height is that of the flag&#x27;s height.

The provincial colours, adopted in 1984, are blue and gold (deep yellow); they are also referred to as &quot;Alberta blue&quot; and &quot;Alberta gold&quot;, appearing on the flag/shield in the sky/background and wheat background, respectively.

In 2001, a survey conducted by the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA) placed the Alberta provincial flag 35th in design quality out of the 72 Canadian provincial, U.S. state, and U.S. territory flags ranked. Out of all Canadian flags, only Ontario and Manitoba ranked lower.

==History==
Around the time of the upcoming centennial celebration of Canadian Confederation petitions were submitted in November 1966 to Premier Ernest Charles Manning by the Social Credit Women&#x27;s Auxiliaries of the Alberta Social Credit League to give Alberta its own unique flag. The flag was designed and approved as the official provincial flag by the Alberta legislature on June 1, 1968.

The Calgary Flames used the flag as a shoulder patch on their home and away uniforms from 2007 to 2020.

<text>A jack-in-the-box is a children&#x27;s toy that outwardly consists of a music box with a crank. When the crank is turned, a music box mechanism in the toy plays a melody. After the crank has been turned a sufficient number of times (such as at the end of the melody), the lid pops open and a figure, usually a clown or jester, pops out of the box. Some jacks-in-the-box open at random times when cranked, making the startle even more effective. Many of those that use &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot; open at the point in the melody when the word &quot;pop&quot; would be sung. In 2005, the jack-in-the-box was inducted into the U.S. National Toy Hall of Fame, where are displayed all types of versions of the toy, starting from the beginning versions, and ending with the most recently manufactured versions.

==Origin==
A theory as to the origin of the jack-in-the-box is that it comes from the 14th-century English prelate Sir John Schorne, who is often pictured holding a boot with a devil in it. According to folklore, he once cast the devil into a boot to protect the village of North Marston in Buckinghamshire. In French, a jack-in-the-box is called a &quot;diable en boîte&quot; (literally &quot;devil in a box&quot;). The phrase jack-in-the-box was first seen used in literature by John Foxe, in his book &quot;Actes and Monuments&quot;, first published in 1563. There he used the term as an insult to describe a swindler who would cheat tradesmen by selling them empty boxes instead of what they actually purchased. It also featured in the Chronicle of the Greyfriars of London in 1547 where it was noted as being used pejoratively to refer to the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist:
== History ==
In the early 1500s, the first jack-in-the-box was made by a German clockmaker known as Claus. Claus built a wooden box, with metal edges and a handle that would pop out an animated devil or &quot;Jack&quot; after cranking the handle. It was built as a gift for a local prince&#x27;s fifth birthday. After seeing this toy, other nobles requested their own &quot;Devils-in-a-box&quot; for their children.

In the early 18th century, improved toy mechanisms made the jack-in-the-box more widely available for all children and not just royalty.

== Models ==
Originally, the jack-in-the-box was made out of wood, but with new technology the toy could be constructed from printed cardboard. Around the 1930s, the jack-in-the-box became a wind-up toy made from tin. Additionally, the tin boxes began to be covered in images from children&#x27;s nursery rhymes with corresponding tunes. Over the years, the jack-in-the-box has evolved into characters other than the clown, such as Winnie the Pooh, The Cat in the Hat, the Three Little Pigs, kittens, dogs, Curious George, Santa Claus, giraffes, and so on.

== Distributors ==
Starting in 1935 and continuing for 20 years, the first company to take on the distribution of the toy was a very small firm named Joy Toy. The company is located in Italy as well as the Netherlands. Since then, Fisher Price, Chad Valley, Mattel and Tomy have all played a major role in distributing the jack-in-the-box.

== In popular culture ==
* The jack-in-the-box has been used for centuries by cartoonists as a way to describe and poke fun at politicians.
* The American fast food company Jack in the Box began using the toy and the phrase as their mascot in the early 1950s.
* A 1945 Disney cartoon called &quot;The Clock Watcher&quot; shows Donald Duck making many failed attempts to close a Jack-in-the-box.

<doc id="472399" wikidata="Q2986103" url="?curid=472399" title="Soviet submarine S-363">
<text>Soviet submarine &quot;S-363&quot; was a Soviet Navy of the Baltic Fleet. Under the designation U137 it ran aground on 27 October 1981 on the south coast of Sweden, approximately from Karlskrona, one of the largest Swedish naval bases. U137 was the unofficial Swedish name for the vessel, as the Soviets then considered names of most of their submarines to be classified and did not disclose them. The ensuing international incident is often referred to as the Whiskey on the rocks incident.

==Standoff==
In October 1981, the Soviet submarine &quot;S-363&quot; accidentally hit an underwater rock about from the South Coast Naval Base at Karlskrona and surfaced within Swedish waters. The boat&#x27;s presence coincided with a Swedish naval exercise, which was testing new equipment in the area. Swedish naval forces reacted to the breach of sovereignty by sending an unarmed naval officer aboard the boat to meet the captain and demand an explanation. The captain initially claimed that simultaneous failures of navigational equipment had caused the boat to get lost although the boat had already somehow navigated through a treacherous series of rocks, straits, and islands to get so close to the naval base. The Soviet Navy would later issue a conflicting statement, claiming that the boat had been forced into Swedish waters by severe distress, but the boat had never sent a distress signal and instead attempted to escape.

The Swedes were determined to continue investigating the circumstances of the situation. The Soviet captain, after a guarantee of his immunity, was taken off the boat and interrogated in the presence of Soviet representatives. Additionally, Swedish naval officers examined the logbooks and instruments of the submarine. The Swedish National Defence Research Institute also secretly measured for radioactive materials from outside the hull by using gamma ray spectroscopy from a specially configured Coast Guard boat. They detected something that was almost certainly uranium-238 inside the submarine that was localized to the port torpedo tube. was routinely used as cladding in nuclear weapons, and the Swedes suspected that the submarine was in fact nuclear-armed. The yield of the probable weapon was estimated to be the same as the bomb dropped over Nagasaki in 1945. Although the presence of nuclear weapons on board &quot;S-363&quot; was never officially confirmed by the Soviet authorities, the vessel&#x27;s political officer, Vasily Besedin, later confirmed that there were nuclear warheads on some of the torpedoes and that the crew had been ordered to destroy the boat, including the warheads, if Swedish forces tried to take control of the vessel.

As the Soviet captain was being interrogated, the weather worsened, and the Soviet submarine sent out a distress call. In Swedish radar control centers, the storm interfered with their radar image. Soviet jamming could also have been a factor. As the Soviet submarine sent its distress call, two ships coming from the direction of the nearby Soviet armada were detected passing the limit headed for Karlskrona.

That produced the most dangerous period of the crisis and was when Swedish Prime Minister Thorbjörn Fälldin gave his order to &quot;Hold the border&quot; to the Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces, General Lennart Ljung. The coastal batteries, now fully manned as well as the mobile coastal artillery guns and mine stations, went to &quot;action stations&quot;. The Swedish Air Force scrambled strike aircraft armed with modern anti-ship missiles and reconnaissance aircraft and knew that the weather would not allow rescue helicopters to fly in the event of an engagement.

After a tense 20 minutes, Ljung called Fälldin again and informed him that it was not Soviet surface ships but two West German merchant ships.

The submarine was stuck on the rock for nearly ten days. On 5 November, it was hauled off the rocks by Swedish tugs and escorted to international waters, where it was handed over to the Soviet fleet.

==Interpretations==
At the time, the incident was generally seen as a proof of widespread Soviet infiltration of the Swedish coastline, and U.S. commentators encouraged Sweden to deploy incident weapons to deter future infiltration. On the basis of an investigation carried out after the incident, the Swedish government concluded that the submarine had entered Swedish waters knowingly to conduct illegal activities.

In an interview in 2006, Vasily Besedin, the political officer on board, gave a different picture. The vessel had dual navigation systems, a well-trained crew and the captain Pyotr Gushchin was amongst the best. On board was staff officer Joseph Avrukevich, who was trained in security techniques. Besedin claimed that the incident had been caused by an error in calculations by the navigation officer. Besedin was, however, a political officer with no training in submarine operations.

The area in which the Soviet submarine ran aground was then a restricted military zone, in which no foreign nationals were allowed. The exact location served as one of only two routes that could be used to move large ships from the naval base in Karlskrona to open water.

The incident is popularly known in the West as &quot;Whiskey on the rocks&quot; (the rock-grounded submarine being a ). In the Soviet Navy, the submarine came to be known as &quot;Swedish Komsomolets&quot;, a pun on both the incident and the widespread tendency to give to submarines Komsomol-themed names.

==In popular culture==
* The 2024 Swedish miniseries &quot;Whiskey on the Rocks&quot; is a comedic retelling of the incident.

<text>In information technology, header is supplemental data placed at the beginning of a block of data being stored or transmitted. In data transmission, the data following the header is sometimes called the &quot;payload&quot; or &quot;body&quot;.

It is vital that header composition follows a clear and unambiguous specification or format, to allow for parsing.

==Examples==
* E-mail header: The text (body) is preceded by header lines indicating sender, recipient, subject, sending time stamp, receiving time stamps of all intermediate and the final mail transfer agents, and much more.
* Similar headers are used in Usenet (NNTP) messages, and HTTP headers.
* In a data packet sent via the Internet, the data (payload) are preceded by header information such as the sender&#x27;s and the recipient&#x27;s IP addresses, the protocol governing the format of the payload and several other formats. The header&#x27;s format is specified in the Internet Protocol, see IP header.
* In data packets sent by wireless communication, and in sectors of data stored on magnetic media, typically the header begins with a syncword to allow the receiver to adapt to analog amplitude and speed variations and for frame synchronization.
* In graphics file formats, the header might give information about an image&#x27;s size, resolution, number of colors, and the like.
* In archive file formats, the file header might serve as a fingerprint or signature to identify the specific file format and corresponding software utility.
* In some programming languages (for example C and C++) the functions are declared in header files.

<doc id="472403" wikidata="Q2060668" url="?curid=472403" title="Coat of arms of Alberta">
<text>The coat of arms of Alberta, the heraldic symbol representing the Canadian province of Alberta, contains symbols reflecting Alberta&#x27;s English heritage along with local symbols. The upper part of the shield features the red cross of Saint George. The lower portion of the shield depicts the Rocky Mountains, grass prairies, and wheat fields – representing Alberta&#x27;s landscape.

A royal warrant of King Edward VII granted the original arms, consisting of only the shield, on 30 May 1907.
The arms were further augmented with supporters, a crest, and motto, by royal warrant of Queen Elizabeth II on 30 July 1980.

The shield, on a plain blue field, features in Alberta&#x27;s provincial flag.

==History==
On 30 July 1980, Queen Elizabeth II augmented the armorial bearings by Royal Warrant with a crest, supporters, and a motto. The helmet under the crest was changed from a steel helmet to a gold royal helmet on 15 January 2008.

==Symbolism==

; Crest
: The crest sits above the shield and consists of a royal helmet crowned with a red and silver wreath, on top of which sits a beaver, resting on top of which is St Edward&#x27;s Crown. White and red are the official national colours of Canada, and the beaver is the official animal of Canada.
; Shield
: The shield represents the natural resources and beauty of the varied Alberta landscape: the Rocky Mountains and their foothills, the grass prairies, and the cultivated wheat fields. St George&#x27;s Cross is an allusion to the arms of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, which once controlled what is now Alberta.
; Compartment
: The compartment or base is a grassy mount with wild roses, the official flower of Alberta.
; Supporters
: The supporters sit on either side of the shield and consist of a golden lion on the left (representing power) and a pronghorn on the right (representing Alberta&#x27;s natural resources). Neither of these is the official animal of Alberta (which is the bighorn sheep).
; Motto
:, meaning &quot;strong and free&quot;, a phrase from the English lyrics of &quot;O Canada&quot;.

<text>Wendy Cowan Alexander, Baroness Alexander of Cleveden (born 27 June 1963) is a retired Scottish politician and the former Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Paisley North. She held various Scottish Government cabinet posts and was the Leader of the Scottish Labour Party from 2007 to 2008. In June 2008, the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s standards committee ruled that Wendy Alexander broke parliament rules by failing to register donations on her MSPs&#x27; register of interests. Wendy Alexander quit as Scottish Labour leader. In 2010–2011 she convened the Scotland Bill Committee on financial powers of the Scottish Parliament.

After leaving politics, she was appointed Associate Dean of Global Business and Associate Dean for Degree Programmes and Career Services at the London Business School, and in April 2015 was appointed as Vice-Principal (International) and Professor of International Education by the University of Dundee.

In March 2016 she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for her work for the university sector. On 30 November 2017, she was appointed as the Scottish Government Trade and Investment Envoy for Higher Education.

Alexander is a member of UK Government&#x27;s DIT/DfE Education Sector Advisory Group and chairs the Global Advisory Board of the Times Higher Education Student.

==Early life and education==
Alexander was born on 27 June 1963 in Glasgow, Scotland to Joyce and Douglas Alexander. She has a younger brother, Labour Party politician Douglas Alexander, who has served as a Member of Parliament and in the Cabinet of the United Kingdom.

Alexander attended Park Mains High School in Erskine and won a scholarship to Lester B. Pearson United World College of the Pacific in British Columbia before studying at the University of Glasgow, where she graduated with a First Class MA (Hons) in Economic and Modern History. She later gained a postgraduate MA in Industrial Relations from the University of Warwick, and an MBA from INSEAD. She was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Strathclyde in 2007.

==Early career==
After her MBA, Alexander worked for Booz &amp; Co., an international management consultancy, undertaking assignments in Europe, Asia, North America and Australasia.

===Adviser to Donald Dewar===
Following Labour&#x27;s landslide victory at the 1997 general election, Alexander was appointed Special Adviser to Donald Dewar when he became Secretary of State for Scotland. She was deeply involved in the preparation of the White Paper on devolution, the Scotland Act 1998 and preparations for the establishment of the Scottish Parliament, all matters she had published on during the 1990s.

==Member of Scottish Parliament==
Wendy Alexander served as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) from its creation in 1999 until 2011.

===Ministerial career===

From 1999 to 2002 Wendy Alexander was a Scottish Government minister, first serving as Minister for Communities, then as Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning, and subsequently as Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning.

As Communities Minister she launched the free central heating installation programme for all pensioners without a system. She oversaw the creation of the first social justice report, &quot;A Scotland where everyone matters – our vision for Social Justice&quot;, setting ambitious new targets for delivering social justice and defeating child poverty in Scotland, and an Annual Scottish Social Justice Report to measure progress towards those targets.

She set up the Homelessness Task Force, which led to radical homelessness legislation and she championed the community ownership of housing by tenants including the removal of £1.6bn of Glasgow debt. The tenants subsequently voted in a referendum 2:1 in favour of transfer – the largest of its kind in the UK, involving 89,000 homes.

As Communities Minister, Alexander fought hard to bring about the repeal of Section 28 to contribute to social acceptance and greater equality for the LGBT community by removing a ban on the promotion of homosexuality by local authorities. in the face of a sustained campaign by Stagecoach millionaire and later SNP donor Brian Souter to keep the legislation. In the end the repeal, contained in the ethical Standards in Public Life (Scotland) Bill was passed by 99 votes to 17. During the final debate, Alexander said, &quot;Repeal is not, and never has been, about the promotion of homosexuality in our schools. It is not about political correctness or, even less, about marriage. It is about building a tolerant Scotland. We know that teachers are confused about the meaning of section 2A, we know that bullying exists in our schools and elsewhere, and we know that children&#x27;s organisations overwhelmingly back repeal.&quot;

Alexander oversaw the Scottish Executive&#x27;s response to the recommendations of the McIntosh Commission into the future of local government in Scotland, introducing a package of measures for local government including giving local authorities the lead role in developing Community Planning, creating a formal Power of Community Initiative (later known as a power of well-being) and establishing the Renewing Local Democracy (Kerley) Working Party on electoral systems. Building on the work of the Best Value Taskforce, she also announced plans for a statutory duty to secure Best Value in local government services.

She also published the first Equality Statement to Parliament, established the Executive&#x27;s Equalities Unit, announced the first Scottish-wide fund to tackle violence against women – the Domestic Abuse Service Development Fund – and the first national loan fund, administered by a new organisation – Social Investment Scotland – to invest in emerging social enterprises and &quot;make it easier for the voluntary sector to emerge as an effective third force, alongside the traditional public and private sectors&quot;.

As Enterprise Minister Alexander launched Smart, Successful Scotland, a widely welcomed new economic strategy for Scotland supporting high-skill, high-value investment such as that by Rolls-Royce. She launched Scotland&#x27;s first ever Science strategy and developed a better pipeline to get ideas out of labs and into businesses, including the Proof of Concept Fund and the Scottish Co-Investment Fund to stimulate private venture capital investment in emerging businesses. She also championed the first broadband strategy for Scotland and took action to tackle the &#x27;digital divide&#x27;.

Alexander promoted a &quot;learning, earning&quot; nation including the doubling of the number of Modern Apprenticeships, jointly leading the Clyde Shipyards Taskforce to help modernise shipbuilding on the Clyde through investment in skills, and in the face of the global downturn in electronics hitting companies such as Motorola launched what became the PACE (Partnership for Continuing Employment) initiative to help those made redundant find work quickly. 
As Minister with responsibility for skills and lifelong learning she promoted higher education enterprise links and championed research, modernising management and widening access to universities by those previously excluded. She also extended Educational Maintenance Allowances to support pupils from low income families to complete their schooling.

Alexander launched a new international economic strategy for Scotland called Global Connections realigning Scotland&#x27;s international economic effort with the Smart Successful Scotland strategy, bringing together Scotland&#x27;s previously separate inward investment and export agencies into one organisation, Scotland Development International and created the Globalscot network to develop and expand Scotland&#x27;s standing in the global business community.

Alexander resigned from ministerial office on 4 May 2002. Following her resignation from Jack McConnell&#x27;s Cabinet she became a visiting professor at the Strathclyde Business School and became a member, and subsequently Chair of the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s Finance Committee. She inspired and led the Allander Series of seminars which had the aim of encouraging fresh thinking on Scotland&#x27;s economic future. The seminars brought William Baumol, Ed Glaeser and Nobel laureates James Heckman and Paul Krugman from across the spectrum of political economy to Scotland to reflect on issues such as the returns to early intervention, supporting innovation and cities as future growth engines.

She also authored &quot;Chasing the Tartan Tiger: Lessons from a Celtic Cousin?&quot; (2003), co-edited (with Diane Coyle and Brian Ashcroft) &quot;New Wealth for Old Nations: Scotland&#x27;s Economic Prospects&quot; (2005), edited an anthology of essays on the life of the late First Minister, Donald Dewar: &quot;Scotland&#x27;s first First Minister&quot; (2005) and wrote a non-political column for young mums in the &quot;Daily Record&quot;.

===Leader of the Labour Party in Scotland===
====Election====
Following the Scottish Parliament elections in May 2007, Alexander became Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth. Following Jack McConnell&#x27;s resignation in August 2007, she announced her candidacy for Leader of the Labour Party in Scotland. Alexander laid out her vision to &quot;Renew the party organisation, reform the policies, and reconnect the Labour Party in Scotland with its electorate&quot;. Other contenders ruled themselves out and she was elected unopposed by Labour MSPs on 14 September 2007.

As the leader of the Labour Party in Scotland, Alexander believed that &quot;the people of Scotland told us loud and clear they wanted change. They didn&#x27;t whisper – they shouted it. So change we must!&quot; She argued that Labour must offer radical change to regain the trust of voters, a vision spelt out in &quot;Scottish Labour New Directions: Change is what we do&quot;, a publication outlining her views on the future policy direction for the Labour Party in Scotland. Addressing Labour&#x27;s Scottish Conference as Leader she spoke of the need for Labour to be the progressive party of Scotland. Alexander argued: &quot;&#x27;Scotland&#x27; is not a political philosophy. &#x27;Scotland&#x27; can just as easily be Adam Smith as it can be John Smith. The world over, politics comes down to a choice: right versus left, conservatives versus progressives, nationalists versus internationalists&quot;.

Organisationally, she called for a new approach to candidate selection, including primary systems to give all Labour supporters a chance to be involved in choosing their local member. Policy initiatives included establishing a Literacy Commission with Rhona Brankin to investigate child literacy standards in Scottish schools (subsequently embraced by all parties in the Parliament), supporting investment in the early years, including nursery places for all vulnerable 2-year-olds, more one-on-one tuition in schools, personalised care plans for those with chronic conditions and legislation providing for a modern apprenticeship for every qualified school leaver who sought one.

====Calman Commission====
Alexander made a speech at the University of Edinburgh on Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day 2007 in which she set out the case for a wide-ranging review of the devolution settlement, with a view to identifying possible areas for reform. The speech laid out her proposals for &quot;a more balanced home rule package&quot; including greater financial accountability and new tax powers for the Scottish Parliament (a cause that she had first championed when she led the Allander Series) in order that the &quot;Union become a more comfortable home for all its members&quot;. She said &quot;Scotland wants to see a future that allows her to walk taller within the UK without walking out&quot; and called for a new &quot;expert-led and independent&quot; Scottish constitutional commission.

As the leader of the Labour Party in Scotland, she set this in motion by working with the Conservative and Liberal Democrat leaders to set up the Commission on Scottish Devolution (aka the Calman Commission) in a &quot;bold cross-party, cross-border initiative&quot;. The review was established by a vote of the Scottish Parliament. The Calman Commission became a unique Scottish Parliament-UK Government joint venture which reported back to the Parliament in June 2009 proposing wide-ranging changes in the financing of the Scottish Parliament. Alexander wrote then &quot;history teaches that constitutional reform has never been gifted to Scotland. It has to be fought and argued for... Calman will shape the next phase of Scotland&#x27;s journey…[with] a range of common sense measures to improve relationships&quot;.

On St. Andrew&#x27;s Day 2010, three years to the day after Alexander&#x27;s call for a Commission, the UK Government introduced a new Scotland Bill. The proposals in the bill closely followed the commission&#x27;s recommendations and proposed major new financial powers worth £12 billion, giving Holyrood control of a third of its budget. Under the legislation, Holyrood will set a Scottish income tax rate each year from 2015, applying equally to the basic, high and additional rates. The UK Government called it the &quot;biggest transfer of fiscal powers to Scotland since the creation of the Union.&quot; In December 2010 Alexander was appointed convener of the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s Committee to report on the bill.

====Scottish independence referendum====
During a TV interview on 4 May 2008, Wendy Alexander suggested that she would be willing to support a referendum on Scottish independence saying &quot;Bring it on!&quot; It was a bold move, but led to suggestions of a rift between her and the Prime Minister, who did not overtly back her. On 7 May, at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, Prime Minister, Gordon Brown stated that she was not, in fact, offering Labour&#x27;s support for an immediate referendum.

During First Minister&#x27;s Questions in the Scottish Parliament, on 8 May, Alexander asked Alex Salmond to bring forward a referendum bill at the first opportunity. Alex Salmond declined the offer of Labour support for a referendum, preferring to delay by at least a further year, saying &quot;We will stick to what was laid out in pages 8 and 15 of the SNP manifesto&quot;.

====Resignation over foreign donation====
In 2007, a controversy developed after it emerged that Alexander&#x27;s campaign team had accepted a £950 impermissible donation from Paul Green, a property magnate, a matter that was investigated by the Electoral Commission and Strathclyde Police. When it emerged that the donation of £950 had come from a personal account, and not a business account, the money was immediately forfeited. Further newspaper reports on 30 November indicated Alexander was aware of the identity of the donor, after having sent a personal letter of gratitude to Mr Green (at his home in Jersey) concerning the donation. As Mr Green was not registered as an elector in the United Kingdom this barred him from donating to a UK-based party. However, the Electoral Commission concluded in February 2008 that Alexander had taken &#x27;significant steps&#x27; to comply with funding regulations and decided there was no basis for further action. As part of the Electoral Commission ruling, they also stated that Alexander &quot;did not take all reasonable steps&quot; and that &quot;there is not sufficient evidence to establish that an offence has been committed&quot;.
These mixed messages have resulted in a number of people questioning the decision, including Alex Salmond the head of the Scottish Government who likened the result to a &quot;not proven&quot; verdict.

In a separate development, a few days earlier in February 2008, the Scottish Parliament standards watchdog reported Alexander to the procurator fiscal for failing to declare as gifts the donations that were made to the fund for her campaign for the leadership of the Labour Party in Scotland. Alexander had been told by the parliamentary authorities that there was no need to declare these donations as gifts. In previous leadership campaigns, campaign donations were not treated as gifts. Again the subsequent investigation led to a decision by the Crown Office to take no further action.

Despite this ruling, on 26 June 2008, on the eve of the Parliamentary summer recess, the SNP-led Standards Committee of the Parliament voted 4 to 3 to propose a one-day ban from the Scottish Parliament as a sanction for not declaring leadership campaign donations as gifts on the Parliament&#x27;s register of interests. The proposed ban was overwhelmingly rejected by the Parliament in a subsequent vote in September 2008. However, with Holyrood going into summer recess at the time, Alexander would have had to wait until September for all MSPs to vote on the recommendation. So, rather than having the issue hanging over her – and her party – Alexander announced her resignation as leader on 28 June 2008. She subsequently stated it had been a mistake for her to take on the leadership of the Labour Party in Scotland while her children were so young.

===Post-leadership===
From 2008 to 2011 Alexander served as a member of the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee. She was also convenor of the Scotland Bill Committee, which produced the report for the Scottish Parliament and UK Government in March 2011 proposing new powers for the Scottish Parliament. Many of these proposals recommend greater fiscal autonomy for Scotland, including improved borrowing powers, the ability to issue bonds and further tax devolution. Despite the Scottish Government&#x27;s initial opposition to the bill they supported the Scotland Bill Committee&#x27;s recommendations, with parliament voting 121:3 in favour. In her valedictory speech on the Scotland Bill, Alexander said: &quot;This initiative has from beginning to end been cross-party, consensual and co-operative among the participating parties. [...] The bill will deliver the most far-reaching transfer of financial powers from London since the creation of the union. [...] In the future, all Scottish political parties will have to make decisions about raising money as well as about spending it. [...] The bill serves Scotland better [...] It is, quite simply, in the national interest.&quot;

Wendy Alexander stood down from Scottish Parliament in May 2011 to seek a new life outside active politics. She also serves as a member of the Social Market Foundation&#x27;s Advisory Board and Reform Scotland&#x27;s Political Advisory Board.

==Member of the House of Lords==
In December 2024, Alexander was nominated for a life peerage as part of the 2024 Political Peerages; she was created &quot;Baroness Alexander of Cleveden, of Cleveden in the City of Glasgow&quot; on 3 February 2025.

==Personal life==
Alexander married economist Brian Ashcroft in 2003, with whom she had twin boys. She has since separated from Ashcroft, now named Elizabeth, who announced their transition to become a woman in 2020.

<doc id="472421" wikidata="Q7297539" url="?curid=472421" title="Ray Goulding">
<text>Raymond Walter Goulding (March 20, 1922 – March 24, 1990) was an American comedian, who, together with Bob Elliott formed the comedy duo of Bob and Ray.
He was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, the fourth of five children of Thomas Goulding, an overseer in a textile mill, and his wife Mary. Upon graduation from high school at age 17, Ray Goulding was hired as a $15-a-week announcer on local station WLLH, using the name &#x27;Dennis Howard&#x27; to avoid confusion with his older brother Phil, an announcer in Boston radio at the time. A year later Ray was hired by Boston radio station WEEI under his own name.

His career was interrupted in 1942 by World War II. After graduating from U.S. Army OCS, he was posted to Fort Knox, Kentucky as an instructor, attaining the rank of captain. While stationed there he met his wife, then-Lt. Mary Elizabeth Leader, likewise attached to the base as a dietitian. They married in 1945 and would eventually have four sons and two daughters.

==Bob and Ray==
Upon his discharge in 1946, Goulding was hired on at Boston station WHDH, where he served as newsreader for the morning program hosted by Bob Elliott. The two men soon discovered an extraordinary comedic rapport and found themselves in-demand as a team. Standing six-foot-two, heavyset and possessing a distinctive baritone voice, Goulding made an effective contrast to his partner both physically and vocally, usually taking on similarly outsize roles in their skits. His dead-on impersonation of Senator Joseph McCarthy inspired a pointed series of Bob &amp; Ray sketches at the height of the Army-McCarthy hearings. He also played all the female roles (using falsetto), most notably cooking expert &quot;Mary Margaret McGoon.&quot; In 1949, Goulding as Mary recorded a novelty cover of &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Be a Cow in Switzerland&quot;, which became a local hit.

==National prominence and television pioneer==
In 1951, Elliott and Goulding were hired by NBC Radio, beginning a four-decade-long association with the network. Also in 1951, they began a short-lived but influential television series &quot;Bob and Ray&quot;, which featured Audrey Meadows and Cloris Leachman. In 1955, the team became resident comedians on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Monitor&quot; radio series. In 1956, he and Elliott won a Peabody Award for broadcast excellence.

For details about Ray Goulding&#x27;s various characters and voices, see the Wikipedia entry on Bob and Ray.

==Personal life==
Away from the studio, Goulding&#x27;s hobbies included photography and sport shooting. Together with Bob Elliott he also wrote a couple of humorous articles for Mad Magazine in the 1950s. He was a lifelong Boston Red Sox fan. Ray Goulding died of kidney failure at his home in Manhasset on New York&#x27;s Long Island in 1990, four days after his 68th birthday.

<doc id="472425" wikidata="Q4454604" url="?curid=472425" title="Michael Nolan, Baron Nolan">
<text>Michael Patrick Nolan, Baron Nolan, PC, DL, KC (10 September 1928 – 22 January 2007) was a judge in the United Kingdom, and from 1994 until 1997 was the first chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. In the words of his obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Lord Nolan .. made a profound mark on national life by substantially cleansing the Augean stable of corrupt politics as founding chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life.&quot;

==Early and private life==
Nolan was the son of James Nolan, a solicitor, and his wife, Jane Nolan. His father&#x27;s family had left County Kerry in the mid-19th century. Lord Nolan cited his parents as &quot;the first and foremost influences on my life&quot;. The Nolan family lived in Bexhill-on-Sea. He, his elder brother, James &quot;Jim&quot; Nolan (died 2001) and his nephews, James, Rossa and Luke, all attended Ampleforth College.

After two years of national service in the Royal Artillery, from 1947 to 1949, he read law at Wadham College, Oxford, where he was awarded an honorary fellowship in 1992. His contemporaries at Oxford included Patrick Mayhew and Stephen Tumim, both of whom became close friends.

He married Margaret Noyes, whom he met at Oxford, in 1953; she was the younger daughter of the poet Alfred Noyes. They had one son and four daughters. They kept a second home on the Côte d&#x27;Azur.

==Legal career==
Nolan was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1953, and specialised in tax law. He became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel (QC) in 1968, and was called to the Bar in Northern Ireland in 1974, becoming a QC in Northern Ireland at the same time. He was a member of the Bar Council in 1973 to 1974, and a member of the Senate of the Inns of Court from 1974 to 1980. He became a bencher at Middle Temple in 1975. He was a member of the Sandilands Committee on Inflation Accounting from 1973 to 1975.

He was a Recorder in the Crown Court in Kent from 1975 to 1982, when he was appointed as a High Court judge and assigned to the Queen&#x27;s Bench Division, receiving the customary knighthood. In 1984, during the miners&#x27; strike, he granted injunctions to the National Coal Board to prevent the National Union of Mineworkers using flying pickets. He was Presiding Judge of the Western Circuit from 1985 to 1988.

He was promoted to the Court of Appeal in 1991, joining the Privy Council. He heard appeals in many high-profile cases, including the case brought by relatives of the football spectators who died at Hillsborough in 1989, and in the case to review the decision not to bring prosecutions after the Marchioness disaster in 1989.

He sat with the Master of the Rolls, Lord Donaldson of Lymington, in &quot;M v Home Office&quot;, finding Home Secretary Kenneth Baker guilty of contempt of court after he refused to bring an asylum seeker back from Zaire, where he had been deported contrary to an earlier court order. He also sat in the constitution of the Court of Appeal which quashed the conviction of Judith Ward for involvement in the bombing of a coach on the M62 in 1974.

After just over two years in the Court of Appeal, he was promoted to the House of Lords in January 1994, becoming a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and receiving a life peerage as a Law lord, taking the title Baron Nolan, of Brasted in the County of Kent.

He retired as a law lord in 1998.

==Committee on Standards in Public Life==
Lord Nolan chaired the Committee on Standards in Public Life from 1994 to 1997. The committee was set up in late 1994 by John Major&#x27;s government after the cash-for-questions affair, and has conducted numerous other inquiries. Its first report in 1995 created waves by recommending full disclosure of MPs&#x27; outside interests. He also produced a report in standards of conduct in local government in July 1997.

The principles embodied and articulated in the first report have since become embedded in public life in Britain, and are often referred to eponymously as the Nolan Principles.

==Later life==
Nolan continued to serve in a public role in his retirement.

In 2000, at the request of Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O&#x27;Connor, he investigated the issue of paedophile priests in the Nolan Report.

Outside of the law, he was also Chancellor of the University of Essex from 1997 to 2002, a Deputy Lieutenant of Kent and a Knight of St Gregory.

In retirement, Lord Nolan suffered from an unspecified degenerative disease, dying in 2007 at age 78. He was survived by his wife, their son and four daughters, and twelve grandchildren.

<text>Cephissus (; , &quot;Kifisos&quot;) is a river in the vicinity of Athens, Greece. Together with the neighbouring river Ilisos, it drains a catchment area of .

The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; (3.15.1) states that the legendary Erechtheus&#x27; wife Praxithea was the daughter of Phrasimus (otherwise unknown to us) by Diogenia (otherwise unknown to us) daughter of Cephissus.

The source of the river is in the saddle depression between the Parnitha and Penteli mountains. From there it flows generally southwest until it reaches the Phaleron Bay between Neo Faliro and Moschato. Presently the river flows near or under the A1 motorway, linking Athens and Thessaloniki for much of its length. This section of the A1 is named &quot;Avenue Kifissou&quot;, near which is the Kifissos Bus Terminal.

<text>Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with physical systems that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium but can be described in terms of macroscopic quantities (non-equilibrium state variables) that represent an extrapolation of the variables used to specify the system in thermodynamic equilibrium. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is concerned with transport processes and with the rates of chemical reactions.

Almost all systems found in nature are not in thermodynamic equilibrium, for they are changing or can be triggered to change over time, and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems and to chemical reactions. Many systems and processes can, however, be considered to be in equilibrium locally, thus allowing description by currently known equilibrium thermodynamics. Nevertheless, some natural systems and processes remain beyond the scope of equilibrium thermodynamic methods due to the existence of non variational dynamics, where the concept of free energy is lost.

The thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium systems requires more general concepts than are dealt with by equilibrium thermodynamics. One fundamental difference between equilibrium thermodynamics and non-equilibrium thermodynamics lies in the behaviour of inhomogeneous systems, which require for their study knowledge of rates of reaction which are not considered in equilibrium thermodynamics of homogeneous systems. This is discussed below. Another fundamental and very important difference is the difficulty, in defining entropy at an instant of time in macroscopic terms for systems not in thermodynamic equilibrium. However, it can be done locally, and the macroscopic entropy will then be given by the integral of the locally defined entropy density. It has been found that many systems far outside global equilibrium still obey the concept of local equilibrium.

== Scope ==

=== Difference between equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics ===

A profound difference separates equilibrium from non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Equilibrium thermodynamics ignores the time-courses of physical processes. In contrast, non-equilibrium thermodynamics attempts to describe their time-courses in continuous detail.

Equilibrium thermodynamics restricts its considerations to processes that have initial and final states of thermodynamic equilibrium; the time-courses of processes are deliberately ignored. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics, on the other hand, attempting to describe continuous time-courses, needs its state variables to have a very close connection with those of equilibrium thermodynamics. This conceptual issue is overcome under the assumption of local equilibrium, which entails that the relationships that hold between macroscopic state variables at equilibrium hold locally, also outside equilibrium. Throughout the past decades, the assumption of local equilibrium has been tested, and found to hold, under increasingly extreme conditions, such as in the shock front of violent explosions, on reacting surfaces, and under extreme thermal gradients.

Thus, non-equilibrium thermodynamics provides a consistent framework for modelling not only the initial and final states of a system, but also the evolution of the system in time. Together with the concept of entropy production, this provides a powerful tool in process optimisation, and provides a theoretical foundation for exergy analysis.

=== Non-equilibrium state variables ===
The suitable relationship that defines non-equilibrium thermodynamic state variables is as follows. When the system is in local equilibrium, non-equilibrium state variables are such that they can be measured locally with sufficient accuracy by the same techniques as are used to measure thermodynamic state variables, or by corresponding time and space derivatives, including fluxes of matter and energy. In general, non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems are spatially and temporally non-uniform, but their non-uniformity still has a sufficient degree of smoothness to support the existence of suitable time and space derivatives of non-equilibrium state variables.

Because of the spatial non-uniformity, non-equilibrium state variables that correspond to extensive thermodynamic state variables have to be defined as spatial densities of the corresponding extensive equilibrium state variables. When the system is in local equilibrium, intensive non-equilibrium state variables, for example temperature and pressure, correspond closely with equilibrium state variables. It is necessary that measuring probes be small enough, and rapidly enough responding, to capture relevant non-uniformity. Further, the non-equilibrium state variables are required to be mathematically functionally related to one another in ways that suitably resemble corresponding relations between equilibrium thermodynamic state variables. In reality, these requirements, although strict, have been shown to be fulfilled even under extreme conditions, such as during phase transitions, at reacting interfaces, and in plasma droplets surrounded by ambient air. There are, however, situations where there are appreciable non-linear effects even at the local scale.

== Overview ==
Some concepts of particular importance for non-equilibrium thermodynamics include time rate of dissipation of energy (Rayleigh 1873, Onsager 1931, also), time rate of entropy production (Onsager 1931), thermodynamic fields, dissipative structure, and non-linear dynamical structure.

One problem of interest is the thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium steady states, in which entropy production and some flows are non-zero, but there is no time variation of physical variables.

One initial approach to non-equilibrium thermodynamics is sometimes called &#x27;classical irreversible thermodynamics&#x27;. There are other approaches to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, for example extended irreversible thermodynamics, and generalized thermodynamics, but they are hardly touched on in the present article.

=== Quasi-radiationless non-equilibrium thermodynamics of matter in laboratory conditions ===
According to Wildt (see also Essex), current versions of non-equilibrium thermodynamics ignore radiant heat; they can do so because they refer to laboratory quantities of matter under laboratory conditions with temperatures well below those of stars. At laboratory temperatures, in laboratory quantities of matter, thermal radiation is weak and can be practically nearly ignored. But, for example, atmospheric physics is concerned with large amounts of matter, occupying cubic kilometers, that, taken as a whole, are not within the range of laboratory quantities; then thermal radiation cannot be ignored.

=== Local equilibrium thermodynamics ===
The terms &#x27;classical irreversible thermodynamics&#x27; and &#x27;local equilibrium thermodynamics&#x27; are sometimes used to refer to a version of non-equilibrium thermodynamics that demands certain simplifying assumptions, as follows. The assumptions have the effect of making each very small volume element of the system effectively homogeneous, or well-mixed, or without an effective spatial structure. Even within the thought-frame of classical irreversible thermodynamics, care is needed in choosing the independent variables for systems. In some writings, it is assumed that the intensive variables of equilibrium thermodynamics are sufficient as the independent variables for the task (such variables are considered to have no &#x27;memory&#x27;, and do not show hysteresis); in particular, local flow intensive variables are not admitted as independent variables; local flows are considered as dependent on quasi-static local intensive variables.

Also it is assumed that the local entropy density is the same function of the other local intensive variables as in equilibrium; this is called the local thermodynamic equilibrium assumption (see also Keizer (1987)). Radiation is ignored because it is transfer of energy between regions, which can be remote from one another. In the classical irreversible thermodynamic approach, there is allowed spatial variation from infinitesimal volume element to adjacent infinitesimal volume element, but it is assumed that the global entropy of the system can be found by simple spatial integration of the local entropy density. This approach assumes spatial and temporal continuity and even differentiability of locally defined intensive variables such as temperature and internal energy density. While these demands may appear severely constrictive, it has been found that the assumptions of local equilibrium hold for a wide variety of systems, including reacting interfaces, on the surfaces of catalysts, in confined systems such as zeolites, under temperature gradients as large as formula_1 K mformula_2, and even in shock fronts moving at up to six times the speed of sound.

In other writings, local flow variables are considered; these might be considered as classical by analogy with the time-invariant long-term time-averages of flows produced by endlessly repeated cyclic processes; examples with flows are in the thermoelectric phenomena known as the Seebeck and the Peltier effects, considered by Kelvin in the nineteenth century and by Lars Onsager in the twentieth. These effects occur at metal junctions, which were originally effectively treated as two-dimensional surfaces, with no spatial volume, and no spatial variation.

==== Local equilibrium thermodynamics with materials with &quot;memory&quot; ====
A further extension of local equilibrium thermodynamics is to allow that materials may have &quot;memory&quot;, so that their constitutive equations depend not only on present values but also on past values of local equilibrium variables. Thus time comes into the picture more deeply than for time-dependent local equilibrium thermodynamics with memoryless materials, but fluxes are not independent variables of state.

=== Extended irreversible thermodynamics ===
Extended irreversible thermodynamics is a branch of non-equilibrium thermodynamics that goes outside the restriction to the local equilibrium hypothesis. The space of state variables is enlarged by including the fluxes of mass, momentum and energy and eventually higher order fluxes.
The formalism is well-suited for describing high-frequency processes and small-length scales materials.

== Basic concepts ==
There are many examples of stationary non-equilibrium systems, some very simple, like a system confined between two thermostats at different temperatures or the ordinary Couette flow, a fluid enclosed between two flat walls moving in opposite directions and defining non-equilibrium conditions at the walls. Laser action is also a non-equilibrium process, but it depends on departure from local thermodynamic equilibrium and is thus beyond the scope of classical irreversible thermodynamics; here a strong temperature difference is maintained between two molecular degrees of freedom (with molecular laser, vibrational and rotational molecular motion), the requirement for two component &#x27;temperatures&#x27; in the one small region of space, precluding local thermodynamic equilibrium, which demands that only one temperature be needed. Damping of acoustic perturbations or shock waves are non-stationary non-equilibrium processes. Driven complex fluids, turbulent systems and glasses are other examples of non-equilibrium systems.

The mechanics of macroscopic systems depends on a number of extensive quantities. It should be stressed that all systems are permanently interacting with their surroundings, thereby causing unavoidable fluctuations of extensive quantities. Equilibrium conditions of thermodynamic systems are related to the maximum property of the entropy. If the only extensive quantity that is allowed to fluctuate is the internal energy, all the other ones being kept strictly constant, the temperature of the system is measurable and meaningful. The system&#x27;s properties are then most conveniently described using the thermodynamic potential Helmholtz free energy (&quot;A&quot; = &quot;U&quot; - &quot;TS&quot;), a Legendre transformation of the energy. If, next to fluctuations of the energy, the macroscopic dimensions (volume) of the system are left fluctuating, we use the Gibbs free energy (&quot;G&quot; = &quot;U&quot; + &quot;PV&quot; - &quot;TS&quot;), where the system&#x27;s properties are determined both by the temperature and by the pressure.

Non-equilibrium systems are much more complex and they may undergo fluctuations of more extensive quantities. The boundary conditions impose on them particular intensive variables, like temperature gradients or distorted collective motions (shear motions, vortices, etc.), often called thermodynamic forces. If free energies are very useful in equilibrium thermodynamics, it must be stressed that there is no general law defining stationary non-equilibrium properties of the energy as is the second law of thermodynamics for the entropy in equilibrium thermodynamics. That is why in such cases a more generalized Legendre transformation should be considered. This is the extended Massieu potential.
By definition, the entropy (&quot;S&quot;) is a function of the collection of extensive quantities formula_3. Each extensive quantity has a conjugate intensive variable formula_4 (a restricted definition of intensive variable is used here by comparison to the definition given in this link) so that:
: formula_5

We then define the extended Massieu function as follows:
: formula_6
where formula_7 is the Boltzmann constant, whence
: formula_8

The independent variables are the intensities.

Intensities are global values, valid for the system as a whole. When boundaries impose to the system different local conditions, (e.g. temperature differences), there are intensive variables representing the average value and others representing gradients or higher moments. The latter are the thermodynamic forces driving fluxes of extensive properties through the system.

It may be shown that the Legendre transformation changes the maximum condition of the entropy (valid at equilibrium) in a minimum condition of the extended Massieu function for stationary states, no matter whether at equilibrium or not.

== Stationary states, fluctuations, and stability ==

In thermodynamics one is often interested in a stationary state of a process, allowing that the stationary state include the occurrence of unpredictable and experimentally unreproducible fluctuations in the state of the system. The fluctuations are due to the system&#x27;s internal sub-processes and to exchange of matter or energy with the system&#x27;s surroundings that create the constraints that define the process.

If the stationary state of the process is stable, then the unreproducible fluctuations involve local transient decreases of entropy. The reproducible response of the system is then to increase the entropy back to its maximum by irreversible processes: the fluctuation cannot be reproduced with a significant level of probability. Fluctuations about stable stationary states are extremely small except near critical points (Kondepudi and Prigogine 1998, page 323). The stable stationary state has a local maximum of entropy and is locally the most reproducible state of the system. There are theorems about the irreversible dissipation of fluctuations. Here &#x27;local&#x27; means local with respect to the abstract space of thermodynamic coordinates of state of the system.

If the stationary state is unstable, then any fluctuation will almost surely trigger the virtually explosive departure of the system from the unstable stationary state. This can be accompanied by increased export of entropy.

== Local thermodynamic equilibrium ==
The scope of present-day non-equilibrium thermodynamics does not cover all physical processes. A condition for the validity of many studies in non-equilibrium thermodynamics of matter is that they deal with what is known as &quot;local thermodynamic equilibrium&quot;.

=== Ponderable matter ===
&quot;Local thermodynamic equilibrium of matter&quot; (see also Keizer (1987) means that conceptually, for study and analysis, the system can be spatially and temporally divided into &#x27;cells&#x27; or &#x27;micro-phases&#x27; of small (infinitesimal) size, in which classical thermodynamical equilibrium conditions for matter are fulfilled to good approximation. These conditions are unfulfilled, for example, in very rarefied gases, in which molecular collisions are infrequent; and in the boundary layers of a star, where radiation is passing energy to space; and for interacting fermions at very low temperature, where dissipative processes become ineffective. When these &#x27;cells&#x27; are defined, one admits that matter and energy may pass freely between contiguous &#x27;cells&#x27;, slowly enough to leave the &#x27;cells&#x27; in their respective individual local thermodynamic equilibria with respect to intensive variables.

One can think here of two &#x27;relaxation times&#x27; separated by order of magnitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zubarev 1971/1974&quot;&gt;Zubarev D. N.,(1974). &quot;Nonequilibrium Statistical Thermodynamics&quot;, translated from the Russian by P.J. Shepherd, New York, Consultants Bureau. ; .&lt;/ref&gt; The longer relaxation time is of the order of magnitude of times taken for the macroscopic dynamical structure of the system to change. The shorter is of the order of magnitude of times taken for a single &#x27;cell&#x27; to reach local thermodynamic equilibrium. If these two relaxation times are not well separated, then the classical non-equilibrium thermodynamical concept of local thermodynamic equilibrium loses its meaning and other approaches have to be proposed, see for instance Extended irreversible thermodynamics. For example, in the atmosphere, the speed of sound is much greater than the wind speed; this favours the idea of local thermodynamic equilibrium of matter for atmospheric heat transfer studies at altitudes below about 60 km where sound propagates, but not above 100 km, where, because of the paucity of intermolecular collisions, sound does not propagate.

=== Milne&#x27;s definition in terms of radiative equilibrium ===
Edward A. Milne, thinking about stars, gave a definition of &#x27;local thermodynamic equilibrium&#x27; in terms of the thermal radiation of the matter in each small local &#x27;cell&#x27;. He defined &#x27;local thermodynamic equilibrium&#x27; in a &#x27;cell&#x27; by requiring that it macroscopically absorb and spontaneously emit radiation as if it were in radiative equilibrium in a cavity at the temperature of the matter of the &#x27;cell&#x27;. Then it strictly obeys Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of equality of radiative emissivity and absorptivity, with a black body source function. The key to local thermodynamic equilibrium here is that the rate of collisions of ponderable matter particles such as molecules should far exceed the rates of creation and annihilation of photons.

== Entropy in evolving systems ==
It is pointed out by W.T. Grandy Jr, that entropy, though it may be defined for a non-equilibrium system is—when strictly considered—only a macroscopic quantity that refers to the whole system, and is not a dynamical variable and in general does not act as a local potential that describes local physical forces. Under special circumstances, however, one can metaphorically think as if the thermal variables behaved like local physical forces. The approximation that constitutes classical irreversible thermodynamics is built on this metaphoric thinking.

This point of view shares many points in common with the concept and the use of entropy in continuum thermomechanics, which evolved completely independently of statistical mechanics and maximum-entropy principles.

=== Entropy in non-equilibrium ===

To describe deviation of the thermodynamic system from equilibrium, in addition to constitutive variables formula_9 that are used to fix the equilibrium state, as was described above, a set of variables formula_10 that are called &quot;internal variables&quot; have been introduced. The equilibrium state is considered to be stable and the main property of the internal variables, as measures of non-equilibrium of the system, is their tending to disappear; the local law of disappearing can be written as relaxation equation for each internal variable

where formula_11 is a relaxation time of a corresponding variables. It is convenient to consider the initial value formula_12 are equal to zero. The above equation is valid for small deviations from equilibrium; The dynamics of internal variables in general case is considered by Pokrovskii.

Entropy of the system in non-equilibrium is a function of the total set of variables 

The essential contribution to the thermodynamics of the non-equilibrium systems was brought by the Nobel Prize winner Ilya Prigogine, when he and his collaborators investigated the systems of chemically reacting substances. The stationary states of such systems exists due to exchange both particles and energy with the environment. In section 8 of the third chapter of his book, Prigogine has specified three contributions to the variation of entropy of the considered system at the given volume and constant temperature formula_13 . The increment of entropy formula_14 can be calculated according to the formula 

The first term on the right hand side of the equation presents a stream of thermal energy into the system; the last term—a part of a stream of energy formula_15 coming into the system with the stream of particles of substances formula_16 that can be positive or negative, formula_17, where formula_18 is chemical potential of substance formula_19. The middle term in (1) depicts energy dissipation (entropy production) due to the relaxation of internal variables formula_20. In the case of chemically reacting substances, which was investigated by Prigogine, the internal variables appear to be measures of incompleteness of chemical reactions, that is measures of how much the considered system with chemical reactions is out of equilibrium. The theory can be generalised, to consider any deviation from the equilibrium state as an internal variable, so that we consider the set of internal variables formula_20 in equation (1) to consist of the quantities defining not only degrees of completeness of all chemical reactions occurring in the system, but also the structure of the system, gradients of temperature, difference of concentrations of substances and so on.

== Flows and forces ==
The fundamental relation of classical equilibrium thermodynamics 
: formula_22
expresses the change in entropy formula_23 of a system as a function of the intensive quantities temperature formula_24, pressure formula_25 and formula_26 chemical potential formula_27 and of the differentials of the extensive quantities energy formula_28, volume formula_29 and formula_26 particle number formula_31.

Following Onsager (1931,I), let us extend our considerations to thermodynamically non-equilibrium systems. As a basis, we need locally defined versions of the extensive macroscopic quantities formula_28, formula_29 and formula_31 and of the intensive macroscopic quantities formula_24, formula_25 and formula_27.

For classical non-equilibrium studies, we will consider some new locally defined intensive macroscopic variables. We can, under suitable conditions, derive these new variables by locally defining the gradients and flux densities of the basic locally defined macroscopic quantities.

Such locally defined gradients of intensive macroscopic variables are called &#x27;thermodynamic forces&#x27;. They &#x27;drive&#x27; flux densities, perhaps misleadingly often called &#x27;fluxes&#x27;, which are dual to the forces. These quantities are defined in the article on Onsager reciprocal relations.
Establishing the relation between such forces and flux densities is a problem in statistical mechanics. Flux densities (formula_38) may be coupled. The article on Onsager reciprocal relations considers the stable near-steady thermodynamically non-equilibrium regime, which has dynamics linear in the forces and flux densities.

In stationary conditions, such forces and associated flux densities are by definition time invariant, as also are the system&#x27;s locally defined entropy and rate of entropy production. Notably, according to Ilya Prigogine and others, when an open system is in conditions that allow it to reach a stable stationary thermodynamically non-equilibrium state, it organizes itself so as to minimize total entropy production defined locally. This is considered further below.

One wants to take the analysis to the further stage of describing the behaviour of surface and volume integrals of non-stationary local quantities; these integrals are macroscopic fluxes and production rates. In general the dynamics of these integrals are not adequately described by linear equations, though in special cases they can be so described.

=== Onsager reciprocal relations ===

Following Section III of Rayleigh (1873), Onsager (1931, I) showed that in the regime where both the flows (formula_38) are small and the thermodynamic forces (formula_40) vary slowly, the rate of creation of entropy formula_41 is linearly related to the flows:
: formula_42
and the flows are related to the gradient of the forces, parametrized by a matrix of coefficients conventionally denoted formula_43:
: formula_44
from which it follows that:
: formula_45

The second law of thermodynamics requires that the matrix formula_43 be positive definite. Statistical mechanics considerations involving microscopic reversibility of dynamics imply that the matrix formula_43 is symmetric. This fact is called the &quot;Onsager reciprocal relations&quot;.

The generalization of the above equations for the rate of creation of entropy was given by Pokrovskii.

== Speculated extremal principles for non-equilibrium processes ==
Until recently, prospects for useful extremal principles in this area have seemed clouded. Nicolis (1999) concludes that one model of atmospheric dynamics has an attractor which is not a regime of maximum or minimum dissipation; she says this seems to rule out the existence of a global organizing principle, and comments that this is to some extent disappointing; she also points to the difficulty of finding a thermodynamically consistent form of entropy production. Another top expert offers an extensive discussion of the possibilities for principles of extrema of entropy production and of dissipation of energy: Chapter 12 of Grandy (2008) is very cautious, and finds difficulty in defining the &#x27;rate of internal entropy production&#x27; in many cases, and finds that sometimes for the prediction of the course of a process, an extremum of the quantity called the rate of dissipation of energy may be more useful than that of the rate of entropy production; this quantity appeared in Onsager&#x27;s 1931 origination of this subject. Other writers have also felt that prospects for general global extremal principles are clouded. Such writers include Glansdorff and Prigogine (1971), Lebon, Jou and Casas-Vásquez (2008), and Šilhavý (1997).
There is good experimental evidence that heat convection does not obey extremal principles for time rate of entropy production. Theoretical analysis shows that chemical reactions do not obey extremal principles for the second differential of time rate of entropy production. The development of a general extremal principle seems infeasible in the current state of knowledge.

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics has been successfully applied to describe biological processes such as protein folding/unfolding and transport through membranes.
It is also used to give a description of the dynamics of nanoparticles, which can be out of equilibrium in systems where catalysis and electrochemical conversion is involved. 
Also, ideas from non-equilibrium thermodynamics and the informatic theory of entropy have been adapted to describe general economic systems.

<text>Ned Payne Austin (April 29, 1925 – February 10, 2007) was an American character actor; he was also a member of the Screen Actors Guild and AFTRA.

Austin was in several films, including &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and &quot;The Happy Ending&quot;, and some regional movies and industrial films. He played the bridgemaster in Stephen King&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Maximum Overdrive&quot;, where he introduced the phrase, &quot;Can&#x27;t you see we&#x27;ve got a situation here?!&quot;. After two seasons of summer stock in Surry, Maine, Austin starred as Daniel Boone for the first three years (1952–1954) of &quot;Horn in the West&quot; in Boone, North Carolina and then moved to Denver, Colorado, where he appeared in about forty stage productions, in various theatre companies.

His television credits include several children&#x27;s shows and parts in &quot;Movin&#x27; On&quot;, &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot;, and a CBS movie of the week, &quot;Company of Killers&quot;, as well as numerous commercials.

Austin&#x27;s son, Sam Austin, starred in the Disney film &quot;Mountain Born&quot; in 1970, shot in Telluride, Colorado. Sam wrote the title song and became one of the youngest members of ASCAP at the age of 12.

In 1972, Austin returned to Boone, North Carolina to live, and he continued to act in community theatre productions and in regionally produced films. He lived there for the remaining 35 years of his life, and died peacefully, in the house in which he was born.

<doc id="472441" wikidata="Q2883469" url="?curid=472441" title="2004 Haitian coup d'état">
<text>A coup d&#x27;état in Haiti on 29 February 2004, following several weeks of conflict, resulted in the removal of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide from office. On 5 February, a rebel group, called the National Revolutionary Front for the Liberation and Reconstruction of Haiti, took control of Haiti&#x27;s fourth-largest city, Gonaïves. By 22 February, the rebels had captured Haiti&#x27;s second-largest city, Cap-Haïtien and were besieging the capital, Port-au-Prince by the end of February. On the morning of 29 February, Aristide resigned under controversial circumstances and was flown from Haiti by U.S. military and security personnel. He went into exile, being flown directly to the Central African Republic, before eventually settling in South Africa.

Aristide afterwards claimed that he had been kidnapped by U.S. forces, accusing them of having orchestrated a coup d&#x27;état against him, a claim denied by U.S. officials. In 2022, a dozen Haitian and French officials told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Aristide&#x27;s earlier calls for reparations had caused France to side with Aristide&#x27;s opponents and collaborate with the United States to remove him from power. This claim was, however, denied by the United States Ambassador to Haiti at the time, James Brendan Foley.

Following Aristide&#x27;s departure, an interim government led by Prime Minister Gérard Latortue and President Boniface Alexandre was installed.

==Events prior to the coup d&#x27;état==

===Controversy over Aristide&#x27;s election in 2000===
The opposition in Haiti accused the government party of election fraud in the Haitian general election, 2000, as did Europe and the United States. The National Coalition for Haitian Rights (NCHR) stated that there were delays in the distribution of voter identification cards. U.S. Congressman John Conyers wrote:

In contrast, Aristide&#x27;s supporters claim that an opposition boycott of the election was used as a ploy in order to discredit it.

In response to this election, European nations suspended government-to-government assistance to Haiti. The U.S. Congress banned any U.S. assistance from being channeled through the Haitian government, codifying an existing situation.

===Aristide&#x27;s request for reparations from France===

In 2003, Aristide requested that France pay Haiti over US$21 billion in reparations, which he said was the equivalent in today&#x27;s money Haiti was forced to pay Paris after winning independence from France 200 years ago.

The United Nations Security Council, of which France is a permanent member, rejected a 26 February 2004, appeal from the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) for international peacekeeping forces to be sent into its member state Haiti, but voted unanimously to send in troops three days later, just hours after Aristide&#x27;s forced resignation.

&quot;I believe that (the call for reparations) could have something to do with it, because they (France) were definitely not happy about it, and made some very hostile comments,&quot; Myrtha Desulme, chairperson of the Haiti-Jamaica Exchange Committee, told IPS. &quot;(But) I believe that he did have grounds for that demand, because that is what started the downfall of Haiti,&quot; she says.&quot;

Following the 2004 Haitian coup d&#x27;état, the appointed provisional prime minister Gerard Latortue rescinded the reparations demand.

===Cross-border paramilitary campaign against Haiti&#x27;s state 2001–2004===
The role of rightwing paramilitary groups in violently targeting activists and government officials aligned with the Aristide government has been well documented. Freedom of Information Act documents have shown how paramilitary forces received support from sectors of Haiti&#x27;s elite as well as from sectors of the Dominican military and government at the time. According to researcher Jeb Sprague, these groups also had contact with U.S. and French intelligence.

Aristide’s controversial progressivism

During Aristide’s second administration in 2003, he doubled the minimum wage, which impacted over 20,000 people who worked in the Port-au-Prince assembly sector. Furthermore, the Aristide government launched a campaign to collect unpaid taxes and utility bills from Haiti’s wealthy population, seeking to reign in the business elite; such developments deeply unsettled the country’s aristocracy.

===Ottawa Initiative===
The Ottawa Initiative on Haiti was a conference hosted by Canada that took place at Meech Lake, Quebec (a federal government resort near Ottawa) on 31 January and 1 February 2003, to decide the future of Haiti&#x27;s government, though no Haitian government officials were invited.

Journalist Michel Vastel leaked information about the conference that he says was told to him by his friend and conference host Denis Paradis, Canada&#x27;s Secretary of State for Latin America, Africa, and the French-speaking world, in his 15 March 2003, article in Quebec news magazine &quot;L&#x27;actualité&quot;. In the article, he claims that the officials at the conference wanted to see regime change in Haiti in less than a year. &quot;Michel Vastel wrote that the possibility of Aristide&#x27;s departure, the need for a potential trusteeship over Haiti, and the return of Haiti&#x27;s dreaded military were discussed by Paradis and the French Minister for La Francophonie, Pierre-André Wiltzer.&quot; Paradis later denied this, but neither Vastel nor &quot;L&#x27;actualite&quot; retracted the story.

===Student protests===
Multiple protests by Haitian students were organized in 2002, 2003 and 2004 against the Aristide government. On 5 December 2003, some of Aristide&#x27;s supporters, backed by the police according to witnesses, entered the social studies department of the Université d&#x27;État d&#x27;Haïti to attack students who were rallying for an anti-government protest later that day. Dozens of students were injured and the University dean had his legs broken. This event led to more protests by students, eventually joined by other groups. A student protest against Aristide on 7 January 2004 led to a clash with police and Aristide supporters that left two dead.

==&quot;Coup d&#x27;état&quot;==
In September 2003, Amiot Métayer was found dead, his eyes shot out and his heart cut out, most likely the result of machete-inflicted wounds. He was, prior to his death, the leader of the Gonaives gang known as &quot;The Cannibal Army.&quot; After his death, his brother Buteur Métayer swore vengeance against those he felt responsible for Amiot&#x27;s death—namely, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Buteur took charge of the Cannibal Army and promptly renamed it the National Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Haiti. In October 2003, France tasked philosopher Régis Debray with leading a commission in Haiti to improve bilateral relations, though strictly instructed him to not discuss potential reparations. In December 2003, Debray said that he had visited the presidential palace to warn Aristide not to have a fate like President of Chile Salvador Allende, who died during the 1973 Chilean coup, with the philosopher telling the president that the United States was planning his overthrow.

On 5 February 2004, this rebel group seized control of Haiti&#x27;s fourth-largest city, Gonaïves, marking the beginning of a minor revolt against Aristide. During their sack of the city, they burned the police station and looted it for weapons and vehicles, which they used to continue their campaign down the coast. By 22 February, the rebels had captured Haiti&#x27;s second-largest city, Cap-Haïtien. As the end of February approached, rebels threatened to take the capital, Port-au-Prince, fueling increasing political unrest and the building of barricades throughout the capital. Haitians fled their country on boats, seeking to get to the United States.

On the morning of 29 February, Deputy Chief of Mission Luis G. Moreno arrive at the presidential palace with Diplomatic Security Service officers and asked President Aristide for a resignation letter. The resignation letter was written in Haitian Creole and its wording was unclear. That same day, Canadian special forces secured Haiti&#x27;s main airport after which Aristide was flown out of the country on a U.S. plane accompanied by US security personnel as the rebels took over the capital and was flown without knowledge of his route and destination. At the time of the flight, France contacted three African nations in attempts to accept Aristide, though they refused, with the Central African Republic ultimately accepting the ousted president who arrived in Bangui via Antigua.

Many international politicians, including members of the U.S. congress and the Jamaican Prime Minister, expressed concern that the United States had interfered with Haiti&#x27;s democratic process, accusing them of removing Aristide with excessive force. According to Rep. Maxine Waters D-California, Mildred Aristide called her at her home at 6:30 am to inform her &quot;the coup d&#x27;etat has been completed&quot;, and Jean-Bertrand Aristide said the U.S. Embassy in Haiti&#x27;s chief of staff came to his house to say he would be killed &quot;and a lot of Haitians would be killed&quot; if he refused to resign immediately and said he &quot;has to go now.&quot; Rep. Charles Rangel, D-New York expressed similar words, saying Aristide had told him he was &quot;disappointed that the international community had let him down&quot; and &quot;that he resigned under pressure&quot; – &quot;As a matter of fact, he was very apprehensive for his life. They made it clear that he had to go now or he would be killed.&quot; When asked for his response to these statements Colin Powell said that &quot;it might have been better for members of Congress who have heard these stories to ask us about the stories before going public with them so we don&#x27;t make a difficult situation that much more difficult&quot; and he alleged that Aristide &quot;did not democratically govern or govern well&quot;. Jamaican Prime Minister P. J. Patterson released a statement saying &quot;we are bound to question whether his resignation was truly voluntary, as it comes after the capture of sections of Haiti by armed insurgents and the failure of the international community to provide the requisite support. The removal of President Aristide in these circumstances sets a dangerous precedent for democratically elected governments anywhere and everywhere, as it promotes the removal of duly elected persons from office by the power of rebel forces.&quot;

==Aftermath==
Supreme Court Chief Justice Boniface Alexandre succeeded Aristide as interim president and petitioned the UN Security Council for the intervention of an international peacekeeping force. The Security Council passed a resolution the same day, &quot;[t]aking note of the resignation of Jean-Bertrand Aristide as President of Haiti and the swearing-in of President Boniface Alexandre as the acting President of Haiti
in accordance with the Constitution of Haiti&quot; and authorized such a mission.

As a vanguard of the official UN force and Operation Secure Tomorrow, a force of about 1,000 United States Marines arrived in Haïti within the day, and Canadian, French and Chilean troops arrived the next morning; the United Nations indicated it would send a team to assess the situation within days.

On 1 June 2004, the peacekeeping mission was passed to MINUSTAH and comprised a 7000-person force led by Brazil and backed up by Argentina, Chile, Jordan, Morocco, Nepal, Peru, Philippines, Spain, Sri Lanka and Uruguay.

In November 2004, the University of Miami School of Law carried out a Human Rights Investigation in Haiti and documented serious human rights abuses. It stated that &quot;Summary executions are a police tactic.&quot; It also stated the following:

U.S. officials blame the crisis on armed gangs in the poor neighborhoods, not the official abuses and atrocities, nor the unconstitutional ouster of the elected president. Their support for the interim government is not surprising, as top officials, including the Minister of Justice, worked for U.S. government projects that undermined their elected predecessors. Coupled with the U.S. government&#x27;s development assistance embargo from 2000–2004, the projects suggest a disturbing pattern.

On 15 October 2005, Brazil called for more troops to be sent due to the worsening situation in the country.

A number of figures from Haiti&#x27;s past re-appeared in government after the rebellion, including Hérard Abraham at the Ministry of the Interior, Williams Régala (a former aide to Henri Namphy) and Colonel Henri-Robert Marc-Charles, a member of the post-1991 military junta.

==CARICOM==
CARICOM (Caribbean Community) governments denounced the removal of Aristide from government. They also questioned the legality of the new government. The Prime Minister of Jamaica, P. J. Patterson, said that the episode set &quot;a dangerous precedent for democratically elected governments anywhere and everywhere, as it promotes the removal of duly elected persons from office by the power of rebel forces.&quot;

As reported by the BBC, on 3 March 2004, CARICOM called for an independent inquiry into the departure of former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and says it would not be sending peacekeepers. Patterson said there had been no indication during discussions with the U.S. and France that the plan which CARICOM had put forward prior to Aristide&#x27;s departure was not acceptable. &quot;In respect of our partners we can only say this, at no time in our discussions did they convey to us that the plan was unacceptable so long as president Aristide remained in office. Nor did they suggest to us anything of a nature pertaining to the conduct of President Aristide in office that would cause us to come to the judgment ourselves that he was unsuited to be the President of Haïti,&quot; Mr. Patterson said. The U.S. and France have been accused of using pressure on CARICOM to not make a formal UN request for an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Aristide&#x27;s removal.

The CARICOM initially refused to recognize the interim government, but in 2006 the newly elected René Préval resumed his country&#x27;s membership in the organization.

==French and U.S. involvement==
In 2022, the French ambassador to Haiti at the time, Thierry Burkard, told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, that France and the United States had &quot;effectively orchestrated &quot;a coup&quot; against Aristide by pressuring him to step down and taking him into exile&quot;. He stated French involvement was likely partly motivated by Aristide&#x27;s call for reparations from France. Another French ambassador, Philippe Selz, told the paper that the decision &quot;to extradite&quot; President Aristide had been made in advance. In response to The New York Times reporting, James Brendan Foley, United States Ambassador to Haiti at the time of the coup, criticized the report&#x27;s allegation that the U.S. had collaborated with France to overthrow Aristide, stating that &quot;no evidence was presented in support of such a historically consequential claim&quot;. He called the claims by the French officials untrue, stating that it was never U.S. policy to remove Aristide. He said that Aristide had requested a U.S. rescue and that the decision to &quot;dispatch a plane to carry him to safety&quot; had been agreed upon following night-time discussions at the behest of Aristide.

On 1 March 2004, US congresswoman Maxine Waters, along with Aristide family friend Randall Robinson, reported that Aristide had told them (using a smuggled cellular phone), that he had been forced to resign and abducted from the country by the United States. He said he had been held hostage by an armed military guard.

Aristide later repeated the same thing, in an interview with Amy Goodman of &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; on 16 March. Goodman asked Aristide if he resigned, and President Aristide replied: &quot;No, I didn&#x27;t resign. What some people call &#x27;resignation&#x27; is a &#x27;new coup d&#x27;état,&#x27; or &#x27;modern kidnapping.&#x27;&quot;

Many supporters of the Fanmi Lavalas party and Aristide, as well as some foreign supporters, denounced the rebellion as a foreign controlled coup d&#x27;état orchestrated by Canada, France and the United States (Goodman, et al., 2004) to remove a democratically elected president.

Some have come forward to support his claim saying they witnessed him being escorted out by American soldiers at gunpoint.

Sources close to Aristide also claim the Bush administration blocked attempts to reinforce his bodyguards. The Steele Foundation, the San Francisco-based organization which supplied Aristide&#x27;s bodyguards, declined to comment.

According to a &quot;Washington Times&quot; article of April 2004

The US denied the accusations. &quot;He was not kidnapped,&quot; Secretary of State Colin Powell said. &quot;We did not force him onto the airplane. He went on the airplane willingly and that&#x27;s the truth.&quot; The kidnapping claim is &quot;absolutely false,&quot; concurred Parfait Mbaye, the communications minister for the Central African Republic, where Aristide&#x27;s party was taken. The minister told CNN that Aristide had been granted permission to land in the country after Aristide himself – as well as the U.S. and French governments – requested it.

According to the US, as the rebels approached the capital, James B. Foley, U.S. ambassador to Haiti, got a phone call from a high-level aide to Aristide, asking if the U.S. could protect Aristide and help facilitate his departure if he resigned. The call prompted a series of events that included a middle-of-the-night phone call to President Bush and a scramble to find a plane to carry Aristide into exile. Foley said that he traveled voluntarily via motorcade to the airport with his own retinue of security guards, including some contracted Americans. Before takeoff, Aristide gave a copy of his resignation letter to Foley&#x27;s aide.

The Associated Press reported that the Central African Republic tried to get Aristide to stop repeating his charges to the press.

Aristide has also denied that a letter he left behind constitutes an official resignation. &quot;There is a document that was signed to avoid a bloodbath, but there was no formal resignation,&quot; he said. &quot;This political kidnapping was the price to pay to avoid a bloodbath.&quot; According to the US embassy translation it reads &quot;Tonight I am resigning in order to avoid a bloodbath. I accept to leave, with the hope that there will be life and not death.&quot; A slightly different translation was given by Albert Valdman, a linguistics professor and specialist in Haitian Creole at Indiana University in Bloomington, Ind. &quot;If tonight it is my resignation that will avoid a bloodbath, I accept to leave with the hope that there will be life and not death.&quot;

<text>During Operation Arc Light (sometimes Arclight) from 1965 to 1973, the United States Air Force deployed B-52 Stratofortresses from bases in the U.S. Territory of Guam to provide battlefield air interdiction during the Vietnam War. This included strikes at enemy bases, supply routes, and behind the lines troop concentrations, as well as occasionally providing close air support directly to ground combat operations in Vietnam.

The conventional bombing campaign was supported by ground-control-radar detachments of the 1st Combat Evaluation Group (1CEVG) in Operation Combat Skyspot. Arc Light operations usually targeted enemy base camps, troops concentrations, and supply lines.

== Aircraft used ==
Previously dedicated to carrying nuclear weapons, the U.S. Air Force began to train strategic bomber crews in 1964 to deliver conventional munitions flying the B-52F.

The B-52Fs were deployed to Andersen Air Force Base on Guam and U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield in Thailand, southeast of Bangkok. To add conventional bomb capacity, Project Big Belly modified all B-52Ds to enable them to carry 30 tons of conventional bombs.

By mid-April 1966, all B-52Fs were redeployed back to the U.S. and were replaced by Big Belly-modified B-52Ds. Later in the Vietnam War, the B-52G was also deployed with the B-52D.

B-52Ds were also used from the 376th Strategic Wing of Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan. The 96th Strategic Air Wing from Dyess AFB, Texas, deployed for Arc Light in June 1970 for 180 days. Upon completion of the Arc Light deployment, the 376th SW B-52Ds either returned to the continental U.S. or were sent to U-Tapao. The 376th SW then ceased bomber operations, but continued flying Young Tiger tanker missions.

== Operations in Laos and Cambodia ==

Congressional investigations of secret CIA activities in Laos revealed that B-52s were used to systematically bomb targets within Laos and Cambodia.

== Operational use ==
The bombers were first used in Southeast Asia on June 18, 1965. Flying from Andersen AFB, Guam, 27 aircraft dropped and bombs on a Viet Cong stronghold. During this mission two B-52Fs were lost in a mid-air collision on June 19, 1965, while circling over the South Pacific Ocean, approximately offshore at the point of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), unable to conduct mid-air refueling in awaiting arrival of KC-135A tankers for pre-strike air refueling.

Missions were commonly flown in three-plane formations known as &quot;cells&quot;. Releasing their bombs from the stratosphere, the B-52s could neither be seen or heard from the ground. B-52s were instrumental in destroying enemy concentrations besieging Khe Sanh in 1968, and in 1972 at An Loc and Kontum.

Arc Light was re-activated at Andersen on February 8, 1972, when President Richard Nixon resumed bombing of North Vietnam in an effort to move peace talks along. Operation Bullet Shot saw over 15,000 men were sent to Andersen on temporary duty over the next 90 days. With limited barracks and other facilities, tents were set up for use by men working 80-hour weeks. Bullet Shot included B-52-D and B-52-G aircraft.

Arc Light missions continued until the cessation of hostilities by U.S. forces on August 15, 1973. Between June 1965 and August 1973, 126,615 sorties (B-52D/F/G) were flown over Southeast Asia. During those operations, the U.S. Air Force lost 31 B-52s; 18 were lost from hostile fire over North Vietnam and 13 from operational causes.

The typical full bomb loads were:

* B-52D: 108 500-lb. bombs, or a mixed load of 84 500-lb. bombs in the bomb bay and 24 750-lb. bombs on underwing pylons.
* B-52F: 36 and bombs in a mixed load, or 51 500-lb. bombs, 27 in the bomb bay and 24 on underwing pylons.
* B-52G: 27 bombs, all in the bomb bay, no external bombs were carried.

==Problems==
Communication leaks undermined the effectiveness of the campaign. According to Stephen Budiansky, &quot;Despite NSA&#x27;s occasional success in tightening up particularly leaky communication practices, the problems continued throughout the war. On Andersen the Vietcong were given as much as eight hours&#x27; warning and often revealing exact launch times and likely targets, because of a Soviet trawler stationed off the island listening to conversations and seeing actual B-52 launches.&quot;

==Combat Skyspot Memorial==
Nineteen technicians of the 1st Combat Evaluation Group were lost in ground combat. On September 21, 2010, President Barack Obama presented the Medal of Honor to the sons of Chief Master Sergeant Richard L. Etchberger for his actions in the battle of Lima Site 85. A memorial to all 1CEVG technicians is located directly behind the Arc Light memorial.

<doc id="472444" wikidata="Q6016618" url="?curid=472444" title="Independent Filmmakers Cooperative of Ottawa">
<text>Independent Filmmakers Co-operative of Ottawa (IFCO) is a Co-operative that supports independent filmmakers in Ottawa by providing low-cost equipment rentals, workshops, grants, and promotions. Membership fees are $80 ($25 for students) and full membership privileges are granted to members who donate at least 20 volunteer hours in service to the co-operative.

==Objects of the association==
The Independent Filmmakers Co-operative of Ottawa (IFCO) is a centre for artists who express their ideas, values and experiences using the medium of film. IFCO provides, on a co-operative basis, training, facilities, equipment, funding, information resources and means to exhibit work. IFCO aims to encourage a critical discourse in and an historical appreciation of film and to develop, support and sustain an innovative and diverse Ottawa-based community of artists.

According to the IFCO&#x27;s bylaws, the objects of the association are to:
# focus specifically on the cultural aspects of filmmaking;
# foster independent filmmaking and to ensure that complete creative control of works produced is retained by the filmmaker;
# provide equipment, facilities, and funds for the production of independent films by IFCO members;
# nurture beginning filmmakers by providing facilities and instruction for training and to encourage originality;
# promote public interest and awareness of independent filmmaking in the Ottawa area;
# gather and share information relevant to the production of independent films.

==History==
IFCO was created in the summer of 1991. It began as a result of the vision of a small, enthusiastic group of up-and-coming filmmakers. This vision was to create an organization which provided filmmakers in the Ottawa area with the facilities, training and funds required to make independent Super 8mm, 16mm and/or 35mm films. IFCO remains, to this day, the only organization which provides this service in Ottawa.

IFCO initially consisted of five founding members (Monica Szentesky, Scott Galley, Wayne Meade, David Chow and Glen Cross) and several volunteers who helped initiate and develop the programs and services that IFCO offered to the region. IFCO was incorporated as a non-profit co-operative corporation in January 1992, and in June 1992 received office space in the Arts Court Building, located in the heart of downtown Ottawa. In June 2009 IFCO became a registered charity.

==Funding==
IFCO receives funding from the Canada Council for the Arts, The Ontario Arts Council and the City of Ottawa, as well as earned revenues through workshop fees, equipment rentals, fundraisers, and annual membership dues; plus in-kind and/or financial support from foundations, private funders and corporate sponsors.

==Controversy==
IFCO was involved in a brief controversy in 2004 when its selection committee chose to grant $1000 to fund a film by Ken Takahashi. The film, to be entitled &quot;Last Night With Jesse&quot;, was to involve a sexual relationship between an adolescent boy and an older man. When word of the grant and the film subject got out following an article by Susannah Sears, a freelancer, who creates crossword puzzles for the Ottawa Citizen, there was quick criticism of public money funding a film &quot;promoting pedophilia&quot;. With city councillors threatening to withdraw city funding and Ontario&#x27;s Minister of Culture saying that she was &quot;uncomfortable with government funding for any film that depicts a sexual relationship between an adult and a child&quot;, the IFCO&#x27;s board quickly quashed the grant citing concerns about the legality of the film. The IFCO board stated that Takahashi couldn&#x27;t confirm whether he planned to use a minor as an actor and therefore could contravene a bill, which became federal law July 20, 2005, that eliminates artistic merit as a defense for those accused of making child pornography.

Takahashi said the issue was &quot;blown out of proportion&quot; and that his movie would not have contained any graphic depictions of sexual relations between a minor and an adult. He described his film as a coming of age story about &quot;a relationship between an older man and an individual coming into sexual maturation&quot;. IFCO denied that the public outcry or threats of funding losses played any part in the decision and that they would have likely funded the film with a reassurance from Takahashi that a person of the age of majority would play the part.

It contains the following active ingredients (15 mL is one tablespoon, half the recommended adult dose):

* Acetaminophen (500 mg/15 mL) (pain reliever/fever reducer)
* Dextromethorphan (15 mg/15 mL) (cough suppressant)
* Doxylamine succinate (6.25 mg/15 mL) (antihistamine/hypnotic)
* Pseudoephedrine (30 mg/15 mL) (nasal decongestant)

===NyQuil Cough===

===NyQuil Sinus===

* Doxylamine succinate (antihistamine/hypnotic)
* Phenylephrine (nasal decongestant)

Nyquil Sinus is available as LiquiCaps only.

===ZzzQuil===
ZzzQuil is a sleep aid, and is not a treatment for pain or cold/flu symptoms. Its active ingredient is:

* Diphenhydramine HCl 50 mg (antihistamine)

===Children&#x27;s NyQuil===
Children&#x27;s NyQuil is artificially flavored for easier consumption by children and contains no alcohol. It is available in the syrup form only. Its active ingredients are:

* Chlorpheniramine (antihistamine)

===Reformulation===
Until 2006, NyQuil Cold/Flu Multisymptom Relief and NyQuil Sinus contained pseudoephedrine (30 mg/15 mL), a nasal decongestant that also formed the active ingredient in Sudafed. Following the passage of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act in 2006, in the United States all pseudoephedrine-containing medications must be kept behind a pharmacy counter and all purchases must be logged.

Vicks chose to reformulate NyQuil Sinus in 2006, replacing pseudoephedrine with phenylephrine. However, studies have shown that phenylephrine is no more effective than a placebo. As of 2012, the only NyQuil variety which contains pseudoephedrine is Nyquil D.

<text>The Queenston Heights is a geographical feature of the Niagara Escarpment immediately above the village of Queenston, Ontario, Canada. Its geography is a promontory formed where the escarpment is divided by the Niagara River. The promontory forms a cliff face of approximately 100 m (approximately 300 ft).

==War of 1812==
Queenston Heights was the site of the War of 1812 Battle of Queenston Heights, where Major-General Sir Isaac Brock was killed in action in the defence of Upper Canada (now Ontario). It is mentioned in the 1867 song &quot;The Maple Leaf Forever&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt; 
At Queenston Heights and Lundy&#x27;s Lane 
Our brave fathers, side by side, 
For freedom, homes, and loved ones dear, 
Firmly stood and nobly died.

And those dear rights which they maintained, 
We swear to yield them never. 
Our watchword evermore shall be, 
The Maple Leaf forever!
&lt;/poem&gt;

==War memorials==
Queenston Heights is the site of Brock&#x27;s Monument and a monument to War of 1812 heroine Laura Secord. There are 235 stairs inside the monument, leading to a viewing area close to the top. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1968. Fort Drummond, also located at Queenston Heights, is separately recognized as a National Historic Site.

<text>University of the Arts (UArts) was a private arts university in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Its campus made up part of the Avenue of the Arts cultural district in Center City, Philadelphia. On May 31, 2024, university administrators suddenly announced that the university would close on June 7, 2024, although its precarious financial situation had been known for some time. It was accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

The university included two colleges and two divisions: the College of Art, Media &amp; Design; the College of Performing Arts; the Division of Liberal Arts; and the Division of Continuing Studies. The School of Music was accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music, and the College of Art, Media and Design by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design.

== History ==
In 1870, the Philadelphia Musical Academy was created. In 1876, the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art was founded as a museum, which became the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and an art school, which went through various name changes and mergers before becoming the University of the Arts. Though never housed in the same building, the museum and the school were one institution. In 1877, the Philadelphia Conservatory of Music was founded.

In 1893, the School of Industrial Art purchased an early 19th century neoclassical building at 320 South Broad Street, which had been designed by John Haviland for the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf.

In 1921, contralto Marian Anderson applied to the Philadelphia Musical Academy but was turned away because she was &quot;colored.&quot;

In 1938, the museum changed its name to the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the school became the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art. In 1964, the school became independent of the museum and renamed itself the Philadelphia College of Art (PCA).

In 1944, the Children&#x27;s Dance Theatre, later known as the Philadelphia Dance Academy, was established by Nadia Chilkovsky Nahumck. In 1962, the Philadelphia Conservatory of Music and the Philadelphia Musical Academy merged; in 1976, the combined organization acquired the Dance Academy and renamed itself the Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts. After establishing a School of Theater in 1983, the institution became the first performing arts college in Pennsylvania to offer a comprehensive range of majors in music, dance and theater. This institution later became the College of Performing Arts of the University of the Arts.

In 1985, the Philadelphia College of Art and the Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts merged to become the Philadelphia Colleges of the Arts, and gained university status as the University of the Arts in 1987.

In 1996, the university added a third academic division, the College of Media and Communication. In 2011, the College of Media and Communication merged with the College of Art and Design to become the College of Art, Media &amp; Design.

The Philadelphia Art Alliance became a part of the university in 2017.

===Financial and enrollment challenges===
In the late 2010s and 2020s, the university faced declining enrollment and a poor financial outlook. In the 2018–19 school year enrollment was at 1,914 falling to 1,149 by the start of the fall 2023 semester. The university was profitable for the 2021–22 fiscal year, but the next year it had a projected operating loss of $2.56 million, on a budget of about $50 million.

From 2018 to 2022, the university led a capital campaign that allegedly raised $67.2 million, including $5.5 million for financial aid and $24 million for its endowment, which grew to $61.2 million. The school also received a $2.5 million grant from Pennsylvania for infrastructure projects. The exact amount gifted has since come into question. The endowment money was not usable for day-to-day operations, which remained imperiled. Starting in 2019, the day-to-day university fund ended each academic year with only a single month of funding remaining. In 2022, the president behind the capital campaign, David Yager, was driven out by a faculty vote of no confidence. He was replaced by Kerry Walk.

In October 2023, Walk privately announced to the deans of the university that &quot;she’d recently discovered serious financial problems that she’d been unaware of when she accepted the job&quot;. This was not communicated to students, faculty or alumni, and is the only known discussion of serious issues before the following May.

=== Closure ===
On May 31, 2024, Walk abruptly announced the school had exhausted all of its funds and would close on June 7. The announcement caught many by surprise, including then-current students, faculty, and the university&#x27;s accreditor, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. The accreditor withdrew the university&#x27;s accreditation the day after the closure was announced; it could be restored if the university successfully appeals. On June 4, 2024, Walk announced her resignation after canceling an information meeting for faculty and students the night before.

On June 5, 2024, the board of trustees hired the consulting firm Alvarez and Marsal to oversee the closure. On September 13, 2024, the university filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation.

== Academics ==
The University of the Arts&#x27; approximately 1,500 students were enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs in six schools: Art, Design, Film, Dance, Music, and the Ira Brind School of Theater Arts. In addition, the university offered a PhD in Creativity. The Division of Continuing Studies offers courses through its Continuing Education, Pre-College, Summer Music Studies, and Professional Institute for Educators programs. The university was accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

== Facilities and collections ==
The university&#x27;s campus, in the Avenue of the Arts cultural district of Center City Philadelphia, included six academic buildings and four residence halls. There were 10 performance venues and 12 exhibition/gallery spaces on campus.

The Albert M. Greenfield Library housed 152,067 bound volumes, 6,936 CDs, 14,901 periodicals, 16,820 scores and 1965 videos and DVDs. The Music Library collection held about 20,000 scores, 15,000 books, 10,000 LP discs, and 8,000 CDs. The Visual Resources Collection includes 175,000 slides. Additional university collections included the University Archives, the Picture File, the Book Arts and Textile Collections, and the Drawing Resource Center.

UArts&#x27; 10 galleries included one curated by students. Exhibitions have included the Quay Brothers, Vito Acconci, R. Crumb, Rosalyn Drexler, April Gornik, Alex Grey, James Hyde, Jon Kessler, Donald Lipski, Robert Motherwell, Stuart Netsky, Irving Penn, Jack Pierson, Anne and Patrick Poirier, Yvonne Rainer, Lenore Tawney and Andy Warhol.

The University of the Arts had seven theaters. The Levitt Auditorium in Gershman Hall is the largest on campus with a seating capacity of 850. Also in Gershman Hall was a black box theater used for student-run productions. The university&#x27;s Arts Bank Theater seats 230, and the Laurie Beechman Cabaret Theater is located in the same building. The university also utilized the adjacent Drake Theater, primarily for dance productions. The Caplan Center for the Performing Arts, located on the 16 &amp; 17th floor of Terra Hall – which opened in 2007, housed two theaters. Its black box theater seated 100 and a recital hall seated 250.

At the time of closing, it had three dormitories for students: Furness Residence Hall, Juniper Residence Hall, and Spruce Residence Hall. In 2023 the university sold another, Pine Residence Hall.

== Polyphone Festival ==
The annual Polyphone Festival of New and Emerging Music, launched in 2016, focused on the emerging musical. Composers, librettists, directors, choreographers and music directors were invited to the campus to work with students on developing musicals.

<text>The Qana massacre took place on April 18, 1996, near Qana, a village in then Israeli-occupied Southern Lebanon, when the Israeli military fired artillery shells at a United Nations compound, which was sheltering around 800 Lebanese civilians, killing 106 and injuring around 116. Four Fijian United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon soldiers were also seriously injured.

The attack occurred amid heavy fighting between the Israel Defense Forces and Hezbollah during Operation Grapes of Wrath. According to Israel, it had launched the artillery barrage to cover an Israeli special forces unit after it had come under mortar fire launched from the vicinity of the compound and radioed a request for support. Israel&#x27;s claims were refuted by a United Nations investigation which later found that the Israeli shelling was deliberate, based on video evidence showing an Israeli reconnaissance drone over the compound before the shelling. The Israeli government at first denied the existence of the drone, but then said, after being told of the video evidence, that the drone was on a different mission. Israel rejected the findings of the UN report concerning the incident.

The incident would attract attention in later years after Naftali Bennett, the commander of the Israeli commando unit which had called in the barrage, entered politics, eventually becoming Prime Minister of Israel.
==Background==

In April 1996, a ceasefire that had ended the July 1993 fighting between Hezbollah and Israel broke down. During the five weeks of fighting between March 4 and April 10, seven Israeli soldiers, three Lebanese civilians and at least one Hezbollah fighter were killed. The tally of injured was sixteen Israeli soldiers, seven Lebanese civilians, and six Israeli civilians. On April 9, in response to the cease fire violations, Major-General Amiram Levin of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) declared: &quot;The residents in south Lebanon who are under the responsibility of Hezbollah will be hit harder, and the Hezbollah will be hit harder, and we will find the way to act correctly and quickly.&quot; On April 11, after initial strikes against Hezbollah positions, the Israeli government, through South Lebanon Army (SLA) radio stations, warned residents in forty-four towns and villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate within twenty-four hours.

Within forty-eight hours, Israel launched Operation Grapes of Wrath. On April 11, the IDF bombarded southern Lebanon and Beirut, first with artillery and later laser-guided missiles. On April 13, Israeli warships initiated a blockade against Beirut, Sidon and Tyre, Lebanon&#x27;s main ports of entry. Meanwhile, Hezbollah continuously bombarded northern Israel with Katyusha rockets. The IDF continued to bomb Lebanon&#x27;s infrastructure.

==Shelling of UN compound==
By April 14, 745 people took shelter in a United Nations compound at Qana, a UN battalion headquarters for 18 years, well-marked on Israeli maps, and bearing white and black UN signs. By April 16, Hezbollah had fired 120 Katyusha rockets into Israel, causing one casualty, at Kiryat Shmona, while Israel was firing over 3,000 shells, conducting 200 missile raids a day into Lebanon, and firing from gunboats on the refugee-crowded roads to Beirut. From 600 to 800 Beirut refugees were crowded in there on April 18. This tactic was widely discussed, and well known to the Hezbollah fighters and Lebanese citizens. Beginning with the second day of combat the IDF had been bombing within 10 minutes directly at any source of fire discovered by reconnaissance. According to a UN report, on April 18 

Hezbollah fighters fired:

(a) Between 1200 and 1400 hours on 18 April, Hezbollah fighters fired two or three rockets from a location 350 metres south-east of the United Nations compound. The location was identified on the ground.

(b) Between 1230 and 1300 hours, they fired four or five rockets from a location 600 metres south-east of the compound. The location was identified on the ground.

(c) About 15 minutes before the shelling, they fired between five and eight rounds of 120 millimetre mortar from a location 220 metres south-west of the centre of the compound. The location was identified on the ground. According to witnesses, the mortar was installed there between 1100 and 1200 hours that day, but no action was taken by UNIFIL personnel to remove it. (On 15 April, a Fijian had been shot in the chest as he tried to prevent Hezbollah fighters from firing rockets.)

(d) The United Nations compound at Qana had taken in a large number of Lebanese seeking shelter from Israeli bombardments. By Sunday, 14 April, 745 persons were in the compound. On 18 April, the day of the shelling, their number is estimated to have been well over 800. When the Fijian soldiers heard the mortar being fired not far from their compound, they began immediately to move as many of the civilians as possible into shelters so that they would be protected from any Israeli retaliation.

(e) At some point (it is not completely clear whether before or after the shelling), two or three Hezbollah fighters entered the United Nations compound, where their families were.
During the operation, a special reconnaissance unit of 67 soldiers from the elite Maglan commando unit commanded by Naftali Bennett was sent into Hezbollah territory to hunt for rocket launchers and enemy fighters. On April 18, they had been operating in Lebanon for eight days when a sub-unit of the force came under Hezbollah mortar fire at 1:52 PM as it advanced near Qana from a Hezbollah mortar team positioned at a cemetery 170 meters from the compound, which fired a total of eight 120 mm mortar rounds at the force. According to eyewitnesses, the mortar team then ran to the compound and took refuge there. Bennett radioed for support, and minutes later, the IDF identified the source of the firing. As it was determined that no ground forces could reach the commandos to provide support, the decision was made to launch an artillery barrage instead. An Israeli artillery battalion positioned just inside Lebanon was called in to provide fire support, and the call for fire was assigned to a single battery of four M-109A2 155 mm howitzers. From 2:07 PM to 2:12 PM, the battery fired 36 high explosive shells, consisting of 26 point-detonating fuze rounds and 10 variable time fuze rounds, all of which missed the area where the mortar had been fired from. The compound was hit by 13 shells, four point direct fuze rounds and nine variable time fuze rounds. The commandos were subsequently extracted by helicopter. As a result of the shelling, 106 civilians died, one Christian, the rest Shias, with more wounded. One man, Saadallah Balhas, lost 37 members of his family in the strike.

A video recording made by a UNIFIL soldier of Force Mobile Reserve (FMR) showed an unmanned drone and two helicopters in the vicinity at the time of the shelling. An Israeli government spokesman confirmed there was a drone in the area, but stated that it did not detect civilians in the compound. The IDF initially and repeatedly claimed, in response to the UN investigator, Dutch major-general Frank van Kappen&#x27;s questioning, that no drone was flying in the area before or during the shelling. All eyewitnesses testified that during the attack a pilotless drone hovered over the camp. The truth only emerged when the UNIFIL soldier secretly delivered the tape to Beirut-based journalist Robert Fisk. Fisk sent the video to his newspaper, &quot;The Independent&quot;, which published stills of the footage in an article that appeared on May 6.

The Qana massacre resulted in a wave of international condemnation. As a result of the intense diplomatic pressure that followed, Israel ended Operation Grapes of Wrath before it had originally planned to.

==Israeli statements==
The Israeli government immediately expressed regret for the loss of innocent lives, saying that the Hezbollah position and not the UN compound was the intended target of the shelling, and that the compound was hit &quot;due to incorrect targeting based on erroneous data.&quot; Army Deputy Chief of Staff Matan Vilnai stated that the shells hit the base not because they were off target, but because Israeli gunners used outdated maps of the area. He also stated that the gunners miscalculated the firing range of the shells.

Prime Minister Shimon Peres said, &quot;We did not know that several hundred people were concentrated in that camp. It came to us as a bitter surprise.&quot; Following the attack, Lieutenant-General Amnon Shahak, the IDF&#x27;s chief of staff, at a press conference in Tel Aviv on April 18 defended the shelling: &quot;I don&#x27;t see any mistake in judgment… We fought Hezbollah there [in Qana], and when they fire on us, we will fire at them to defend ourselves… I don&#x27;t know any other rules of the game, either for the army or for civilians…&quot;

Both the United States and Israeli governments accused Hezbollah of &quot;shielding&quot;, the use of civilians as a cover for military activities, which is a breach of the laws of war. The United States State Department spokesperson, Nicolas Burns, stated, &quot;Hezbollah [is] using civilians as cover. That&#x27;s a despicable thing to do, an evil thing.&quot; and Prime Minister Shimon Peres cited the use of human shielding to blame Hezbollah. On April 18 he said, &quot;They used them as a shield, they used the UN as a shield—the UN admitted it.&quot; Rabbi Yehuda Amital, a member of Peres&#x27; cabinet, called the Qana killings a desecration of God&#x27;s name.

==UN investigation==

The UN appointed military advisor Major-General Franklin van Kappen of the Netherlands to investigate the incident. His conclusions were: (a) The distribution of impacts at Qana shows two distinct concentrations, whose mean points of impact are about 140 metres apart. If the guns were converged, as stated by the Israeli forces, there should have been only one main point of impact.
(b) The pattern of impacts is inconsistent with a normal overshooting of the declared target (the mortar site) by a few rounds, as suggested by the Israeli forces. (c) During the shelling, there was a perceptible shift in the weight of fire from the mortar site to the United Nations compound.
(d) The distribution of point impact detonations and air bursts makes it improbable that impact fuses and proximity fuses were employed in random order, as stated by the Israeli forces. (e) There were no impacts in the second target area which the Israeli forces claim to have shelled. (f) Contrary to repeated denials, two Israeli helicopters and a remotely piloted vehicle were present in the Qana area at the time of the shelling. While the possibility cannot be ruled out completely, it is unlikely that the shelling of the United Nations compound was the result of gross technical and/or procedural errors.

==Israel&#x27;s response to the report==

Israel issued the following response to the UN report:

1. Israel categorically rejects the findings of the UN report concerning the incident at Kana;

2. Israel profoundly regrets the loss of human life at Kana and has thoroughly investigated this tragic incident which was caused, first and foremost, by the firing of Katyusha rockets and mortars by Hizbullah from a location in close proximity to the UN position; We reiterate that the IDF had no intention whatsoever of firing on the UN position at Kana. Our investigation has shown that the UN position was hit by artillery fire due to incorrect targeting based on erroneous data. The IAF drone shown on videotape did not reach the area until after the UN position was hit and was not an operational component in the targeting of Israeli artillery fire in the area;

3. It is difficult to understand and highly regrettable that this report does not condemn Hizbullah for the cynical use of civilians as a shield for its gunmen, nor does it continue any condemnation of Hizbullah&#x27;s use of areas contiguous or in close proximity to UN positions for launching attacks upon Israel;

4. This inaccurate and one sided report is misleading, runs contrary to the stated desire of the UN to play a more active role in the Middle East peace process and undermines its ability to do so. Israel hopes that the understanding reached between the various sides will engender the calm and stability necessary to engage the parties concerned in peace negotiations which are the only way to promote peace and security between Israel and Lebanon.

==Amnesty International report==
Amnesty International conducted an on-site investigation of the incident in collaboration with military experts, using interviews with UNIFIL staff and civilians in the compound, and posing questions to the IDF, who did not reply. Amnesty concluded, &quot;the IDF intentionally attacked the UN compound, although the motives for doing so remain unclear. The IDF have failed to substantiate their claim that the attack was a mistake. Even if they were to do so they would still bear responsibility for killing so many civilians by taking the risk to launch an attack so close to the UN compound.&quot;

Amnesty International could not establish with certainty whether or not the IDF knew that Lebanese civilians were sheltering in the compound when it was attacked. However, it wrote: &quot;even if the IDF did not have specific information regarding civilians sheltering there, the general information it did possess concerning civilians in UN compounds – in addition to Israel&#x27;s recognition that UN positions as such are not legitimate targets – should have been sufficient to prevent such an attack. The fact that the attack proceeded can only indicate a callous disregard for the protection of civilian lives and therefore a clear breach of the laws of war&#x27;s prohibitions on directly or indiscriminately targeting civilians.&quot;

Amnesty International said it was also clear that Hezbollah fired a mortar from a position within 200 metres of the periphery of the UN compound and that they were firing at an IDF patrol who had infiltrated north of the security zone and had apparently been laying mines. Amnesty argued that while &quot;[t]he intention of the Hizbullah combatants in choosing that location for the mortar is unclear&quot;, &quot;by taking up positions where they did they [Hizbullah] clearly were reckless as to the consequences this might have for the civilians in the immediate area. In either case, this is a clear breach of the laws of war&#x27;s prohibitions on using the civilian population as a shield.&quot; Nonetheless, the Amnesty International investigation concluded, &quot;Hizbullah’s action in no way justifies the IDF attack on the compound.&quot;

==View of Human Rights Watch==
Human Rights Watch concurred, &quot;The decision of those who planned the attack to choose a mix of high-explosive artillery shells that included deadly anti-personnel shells designed to maximize injuries on the ground—and the sustained firing of such shells, without warning, in close proximity to a large concentration of civilians — violated a key principle of international humanitarian law.&quot;

==UN General Assembly vote==

On 12 May 1997 Arab members of the United Nations financial committee lodged a claim against Israel for the cost of the damage the shelling caused to the UN base in Qana. It was calculated $893,319 was spent on reconstructing the base and treating the UN casualties. An additional $880,000 was spent relocating the battalion. This figure didn’t not include any calculation of the cost of the casualties and deaths of civilians.

The following month, by a 66 to 2 vote (59 abstentions, United States and Israel voting against), the United Nations General Assembly decided that the $1.7 million cost of repairs to the UNIFIL headquarters should be paid for by Israel.

Votes to reaffirm the resolution that Israel should pay the costs of damage appeared before the General Assembly every year until 2003 with the same pattern—one third for, one third abstaining, two (United States and Israel) against. The United States claims that financial resolutions, such as this, had to be adopted by consensus to apply, and Israel rejected any responsibility for it, claiming that &quot;any damage caused to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)&quot;, is &quot;the direct consequence of terrorist aggression and Lebanese collusion.&quot;

==Israeli &quot;Kol Ha&#x27;ir&quot; report==
In May 1996 the Israeli weekly newspaper &quot;Kol Ha&#x27;ir&quot; published the personal accounts of several members of the Israeli artillery battery responsible for the shelling of the Qana camp. The soldiers spoke under condition of anonymity. One acknowledged that they were encouraged by their commander after the attack: &quot;He told us it was war. Come on, the bastards fire at you, what can you do? He told us we were firing well and we should keep it up, and that Arabs, you know there are millions of them,&quot; Soldier A was quoted as saying. Another artilleryman, Soldier T, was quoted as saying that &quot;no-one spoke about it as if it was a mistake. We did our job and we are at peace with that. Even &#x27;S&#x27; told us we were great and that they were just a bunch of Arabs (in Hebrew, &#x27;arabushim&#x27;)...How many Arabs are there and how many Jews? A few &#x27;arabushim&#x27; die, there is no harm in that.&quot; Similar sentiments were expressed by another soldier, Soldier Y, who remarked, &quot;it&#x27;s a war, in a war these things happen...It&#x27;s just a bunch of Arabs. Why are you taking it so hard?&quot; An official army spokesman&#x27;s statement questioned the accuracy of &quot;Kol Ha&#x27;ir&quot; report.

==Lawsuit by relatives ==
On December 15, 2005, relatives of the victims filed suit in a Washington, DC court against former IDF Chief of Staff Moshe Yaalon for his role in the deaths. The lawsuit was prepared by the Center for Constitutional Rights. Yaalon, who was a visiting scholar in Washington, reportedly refused the papers serving the lawsuit. Among the plaintiffs named in the lawsuit are Saadallah Ali Belhas and his son Ali Saadallah Belhas who lost 31 family members in the shelling including their respective wives and 12 children. The United States District Court dismissed the complaint in 2006 on the basis that Yaalon was entitled to immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. The United States Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia affirmed the dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in 2008.

==2015 Israeli elections==
Criticism of Bennett&#x27;s actions emerged during the lead up to the March 2015 Israeli elections, during which Bennett was leading one of the parties. Journalist Yigal Sarna claimed that Bennett had changed operational plans without consulting his superiors, whom he viewed as cowardly, and proceeded to lead his troops into an ambush. Sarna referred to the incident as ostensible evidence that Bennett showed poor judgement. Israeli journalist Raviv Drucker citing an anonymous &quot;senior army figure&quot; reported that Bennett&#x27;s radio call for support was &quot;hysterical&quot; and contributed to the outcome that ensued. Bennett&#x27;s deputy during the operation dismissed Drucker&#x27;s charges as “Vanity of vanities, nonsense, a pile of bullshit&quot;. Bennett&#x27;s position was also defended by other officers involved in the incident, including David Zonshine, later chairman of the human rights NGO B&#x27;Tselem, who called the reports &quot;disconnected from reality,&quot; and by &quot;Haaretz&quot;″s defense analyst Amos Harel, who noted that &quot;Even if we assume for a moment that he was indeed hysterical on the radio, because his soldiers were in danger — Bennett wouldn’t be the first or last company commander in IDF history to have that happen to him.&quot;

Retired General Amiram Levin, who headed the IDF Northern Command at the time, also defended Bennett&#x27;s actions, stating that he &quot;commanded a force that operated deep in enemy territory and performed admirably&quot; and that the IDF was forced to initiate rescue fire after the force was exposed and mortar fire began falling close to the troops. According to Levin, Bennett &quot;demonstrated level-headedness and did not panic.&quot;

<text>Pierre Léon Boutroux (; 6 December 1880 – 15 August 1922) was a French mathematician and historian of science. Boutroux is chiefly known for his work in the history and philosophy of mathematics.

==Biography==
He was born in Paris on 6 December 1880 into a well connected family of the French intelligentsia. His father was the philosopher Émile Boutroux. His mother was Aline Catherine Eugénie Poincaré, sister of the scientist and mathematician Henri Poincaré. A cousin of Aline, Raymond Poincaré was to be President of France.

He occupied the mathematics chair at Princeton University from 1913 until 1914. He occupied the History of sciences chair from 1920 to 1922.

Boutroux published his major work &quot;Les principes de l&#x27;analyse mathématique&quot; in two volumes; &quot;Volume 1&quot; in 1914 and &quot;Volume 2&quot; in 1919. This is a comprehensive view of the whole field of mathematics at the time.

He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1904 at Heidelberg, in 1908 at Rome, and in 1920 at Strasbourg.

He died on 15 August 1922, aged 41 years.

<doc id="472458" wikidata="Q297881" url="?curid=472458" title="Louise Lévêque de Vilmorin">
<text>Marie Louise Lévêque de Vilmorin (4 April 1902 – 26 December 1969) was a French novelist, poet and journalist. Vilmorin was best known as a writer of delicate but tales, often set in aristocratic or artistic milieu.

==Early life==

Born 4 April 1902 in the family château at Verrières-le-Buisson, Essonne, a suburb southwest of Paris, she was heir to a great French seed company fortune, that of Vilmorin. She was afflicted with a slight limp that became a personal trademark. 

Louise was the younger daughter of Philippe de Vilmorin (1872–1917) by his wife, Berthe Marie &quot;Mélanie&quot; de Gaufridy de Dortan (1876–1937), daughter of Roger de Gaufridy de Dortan (1843–1905) and his wife, Adélaïde de Verdonnet (1853–1918), all members of an old French nobility.

Her siblings included a sister, Marie &quot;Mapie&quot; Pierre (1901–1972), who married, as her first husband, a cousin, Guy Marie Félix Lévêque de Vilmorin (1896-1984) in 1922 (div. 1932) by whom she had three children. She married again in 1933, Guillaume de Toulouse-Lautrec-Montfa, comte de Toulouse-Lautrec (1902–1955), a relative of the painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec; by him she had further issue a son and a daughter. She became a popular food columnist in French magazines as Mapie de Toulouse-Lautrec. In addition, Louise had four brothers: Henry (1903–1961), Olivier (1904–1962), André (1907–1987), and Roger (1905–1980), who was fathered by Alfonso XIII of Spain.

==Career==
Her most famous novel was &quot;Madame de...&quot;, published in 1951, which was adapted into the celebrated film &quot;The Earrings of Madame de...&quot; (1953), directed by Max Ophüls and starring Charles Boyer, Danielle Darrieux and Vittorio de Sica. Vilmorin&#x27;s other works included &quot;Juliette&quot;, &quot;La lettre dans un taxi&quot;, &quot;Les belles amours&quot;, &quot;Saintes-Unefois&quot;, and &quot;Intimités&quot;. Her letters to Jean Cocteau were published after the death of both correspondents. She was awarded the Renée Vivien prize for women poets in 1949.

Francis Poulenc literally sang her praises, considering her an equal to Paul Éluard and Max Jacob, found in her writing &quot;a sort of sensitive impertinence, &quot;libertinage&quot;, and an appetite which, carried on into song [is] what I tried to express in my extreme youth with Marie Laurencin in &quot;Les Biches&quot;&quot;. (Ivry 1996)

==Relationships==
As a young woman, in 1923, she had been engaged to novelist and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry; however, the engagement was called off, even though Saint-Exupéry gave up flying for a while after her family protested such a risky occupation. Vilmorin&#x27;s first husband was an American real-estate heir, Henry Leigh Hunt (1886–1972), the only son of Leigh S. J. Hunt, a businessman who once owned much of Las Vegas, Nevada by his wife, Jessie Noble. They married in 1925 (1924 according to other sources), moved to Las Vegas, and divorced in the 1930s. They had three daughters: 
* Jessie Leigh Hunt (b. 3 February 1929, Hauts-de-Seine, Neuilly-sur-Seine not 1928 as misreported). She married in 1951 (divorced by 1962) Albert Cabell Bruce Jr. (b. 11 August 1925), only son of Albert Cabell Bruce (nephew of William Cabell Bruce) by his wife, Helen Eccleston Whitridge (granddaughter of Gov. Oden Bowie), by whom she had issue, four sons: Cabell, Leigh, Thomas, and James, all born 1952–1959 in Midland, Texas. She then married Clement Biddle Wood, an editor of &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, in 1965.
* Alexandra Leigh Hunt (b. 1 April 1930, Hauts-de-Seine, Neuilly-sur-Seine) married Henry Ridgeley Horsey (b. 18 October 1924, Dover, Delaware, USA). Her children were Henry Ridgely Horsey Jr., Edmond Philip de Vilmorin Horsey, Alexandra Thérèse Leigh-Hunt Horsey, Randall Revell Horsey, Philippa Ridgely Horsey,
* Helena Leigh Hunt (23 June 1931, Hauts-de-Seine, Neuilly-sur-Seine – 28 December 1995, Southampton Hospital, Long Island, New York, aged 64), a realist still-life painter. She was married (div) to John Tracy Baxter (b. 23 August 1926, Macon, Georgia), with whom according to the New York obituary, she had three daughters, Elizabeth Baxter, Etienne Baxter, and Leigh Baxter (Mrs Warre).

Her second husband was Count Paul Pálffy ab Erdöd (1890–1968), a much-married Austrian-born Hungarian playboy, who had been second husband to the Hungarian countess better known as Etti Plesch, owner of two Epsom Derby winners. Palffy married Louise as his fifth wife in 1938, but the couple soon divorced.

Vilmorin was the mistress of another of Etti Plesch&#x27;s husbands, Count Maria &quot;Thomas&quot; Paul Esterházy de Galántha (1901–1964), who left his wife in 1942 for Vilmorin. They never married. For a number of years, she was the mistress of Duff Cooper, British ambassador to France. Louise spent the last years of her life as the companion of the French Cultural Affairs Minister and author André Malraux, calling herself &quot;Marilyn Malraux&quot;.

==Death and legacy==

Louise de Vilmorin died 26 December 1969.
She is memorialised in placenames across France, including in Limeil-Brévannes, Mantes-la-Jolie, Draveil, Saint-Pierre-du-Perray, Mennecy and Avrainville.

==In popular culture==
She was a significant character in Antonio Iturbe’s 2017 Spanish language novel &quot;A cielo abierto&quot; which was translated into English and published in 2021 with the title &quot;The Prince of the Skies&quot;.

<doc id="472463" wikidata="Q62857" url="?curid=472463" title="Maurice Wilkes">
<text>Sir Maurice Vincent Wilkes (26 June 1913 – 29 November 2010) was an English computer scientist who designed and helped build the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC), one of the earliest stored program computers, and who invented microprogramming, a method for using stored-program logic to operate the control unit of a central processing unit&#x27;s circuits. At the time of his death, Wilkes was an Emeritus Professor at the University of Cambridge.

==Early life, education, and military service==
Wilkes was born in Dudley, Worcestershire, England the only child of Ellen (Helen), née Malone (1885–1968) and Vincent Joseph Wilkes (1887–1971), an accounts clerk at the estate of the Earl of Dudley. He grew up in Stourbridge, West Midlands, and was educated at King Edward VI College, Stourbridge. During his school years he was introduced to amateur radio by his chemistry teacher.
He studied the Mathematical Tripos at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, from 1931 to 1934, and in 1936 completed his PhD in physics on the subject of radio propagation of very long radio waves in the ionosphere. He was appointed to a junior faculty position of the University of Cambridge, through which he was involved in the establishment of a computing laboratory. He was called up for military service during World War II and worked on radar at the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) and in operational research.

==Research and career==
In 1945, Wilkes was appointed as the second director of the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory (later known as the Computer Laboratory).

The Cambridge laboratory initially had many different computing devices, including a differential analyser. One day Leslie Comrie visited Wilkes and lent him a copy of John von Neumann&#x27;s prepress description of the EDVAC, a successor to the ENIAC under construction by Presper Eckert and John Mauchly at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering. He had to read it overnight because he had to return it and no photocopying facilities existed. He decided immediately that the document described the logical design of future computing machines, and that he wanted to be involved in the design and construction of such machines. In August 1946 Wilkes travelled by ship to the United States to enroll in the Moore School Lectures, of which he was only able to attend the final two weeks because of various travel delays. During the five-day return voyage to England, Wilkes sketched out in some detail the logical structure of the machine which would become EDSAC.

===EDSAC===
Since his laboratory had its own funding, he was immediately able to start work on a small practical machine, EDSAC (for &quot;Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator&quot;), once back at Cambridge. He decided that his mandate was not to invent a better computer, but simply to make one available to the university. Therefore, his approach was relentlessly practical. He used only proven methods for constructing each part of the computer. The resulting computer was slower and smaller than other planned contemporary computers. However, his laboratory&#x27;s computer was the second practical stored-program computer to be completed and operated successfully from May 1949, well over a year before the much larger and more complex EDVAC. In 1950, along with David Wheeler, Wilkes used EDSAC to solve a differential equation relating to gene frequencies in a paper by Ronald Fisher. This represents the first use of a computer for a problem in the field of biology.

===Other computing developments===
In 1951, he developed the concept of microprogramming from the realisation that the central processing unit of a computer could be controlled by a miniature, highly specialised computer program in high-speed ROM. This concept greatly simplified CPU development. Microprogramming was first described at the University of Manchester Computer Inaugural Conference in 1951, then expanded and published in IEEE Spectrum in 1955. This concept was implemented for the first time in EDSAC 2, which also used multiple identical &quot;bit slices&quot; to simplify design. Interchangeable, replaceable tube assemblies were used for each bit of the processor. The next computer for his laboratory was the Titan, a joint venture with Ferranti Ltd begun in 1963. It eventually supported the UK&#x27;s first time-sharing system which was inspired by CTSS and provided wider access to computing resources in the university, including time-shared graphics systems for mechanical CAD.

A notable design feature of the Titan&#x27;s operating system was that it provided controlled access based on the identity of the program, as well as or instead of, the identity of the user. It introduced the password encryption system used later by Unix. Its programming system also had an early version control system.

Wilkes is also credited with the idea of symbolic labels, macros and subroutine libraries. These are fundamental developments that made programming much easier and paved the way for high-level programming languages. Later, Wilkes worked on an early timesharing system (now termed a multi-user operating system) and distributed computing. Toward the end of the 1960s, Wilkes also became interested in capability-based computing, and the laboratory assembled a unique computer, the Cambridge CAP.

In 1974, Wilkes encountered a Swiss data network (at Hasler AG) that used a ring topology to allocate time on the network. The laboratory initially used a prototype to share peripherals. Eventually, commercial partnerships were formed, and similar technology became widely available in the UK.

===Awards, honours and leadership===
Wilkes received a number of distinctions: he was a Knight Bachelor, Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society, a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering and a Fellow of the Royal Society.
Wilkes was a founder member of the British Computer Society (BCS) and its first president (1957–1960). He received the Turing Award in 1967, with the following citation: &quot;Professor Wilkes is best known as the builder and designer of the EDSAC, the first computer with an internally stored program. Built in 1949, the EDSAC used a mercury delay-line memory. He is also known as the author, with David Wheeler and Stanley Gill, of a volume on &quot;Preparation of Programs for Electronic Digital Computers&quot; in 1951, in which program libraries were effectively introduced.&quot; In 1968 he received the Harry H. Goode Memorial Award, with the following citation: &quot;For his many original achievements in the computer field, both in engineering and software, and for his contributions to the growth of professional society activities and to international cooperation among computer professionals.&quot;

In 1972, Wilkes was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science by Newcastle University.

In 1980, he retired from his professorships and post as the head of the Computer Laboratory and joined the central engineering staff of Digital Equipment Corporation in Maynard, Massachusetts, US.

Wilkes was awarded the Faraday Medal by the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1981. The Maurice Wilkes Award, awarded annually for an outstanding contribution to computer architecture made by a young computer scientist or engineer, is named after him.
In 1986, he returned to England and became a member of Olivetti&#x27;s Research Strategy Board. In 1987, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) by the University of Bath. In 1993 Wilkes was presented, by Cambridge University, with an honorary Doctor of Science degree. In 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. He was awarded the Mountbatten Medal in 1997 and in 2000 presented the inaugural Pinkerton Lecture. He was knighted in the 2000 New Years Honours List. In 2001, he was inducted as a Fellow of the Computer History Museum &quot;for his contributions to computer technology, including early machine design, microprogramming, and the Cambridge Ring network.&quot; In 2002, Wilkes moved back to the Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, as an emeritus professor.

In his memoirs Wilkes wrote:

<doc id="472464" wikidata="Q3196604" url="?curid=472464" title="Kill (body of water)">
<text>A kill is a body of water, most commonly a creek, but also a tidal inlet, river, strait, or arm of the sea. The term is derived from the Middle Dutch &quot;kille&quot; (&quot;kil&quot; in modern Dutch), meaning &quot;riverbed&quot; or &quot;water channel&quot;. It is found in areas of Dutch influence in the Netherlands&#x27; former North American colony of New Netherland, primarily the Hudson and Delaware Valleys.

Examples of the freestanding use of &quot;kill&quot; are:
*Anthony Kill, in Saratoga County, New York which flows from Round Lake through the city of Mechanicville into the Hudson River.
*Arthur Kill and Kill Van Kull, both separating Staten Island, New York from New Jersey
*Batten Kill, Vermont and New York
*Bronx Kill between the Bronx and Randalls Island
*Fresh Kills, New York
*Normans Kill, an upper Hudson River tributary near Albany, New York
*Poesten Kill, a creek near Troy, New York 
*Wynants Kill, another creek near Troy, New York
*West Kill, a creek in Greene County, New York
*West Kill, New York

&quot;Kill&quot; is also joined with a noun to create a composite name for a place or body of water:
*Catskill, New York
*Catskill Mountains, New York
*Catskill Creek which flows from the Catskill Mountains, New York to the Hudson River.
*Cobleskill, New York
*Cresskill, New Jersey
*Fishkill, New York
*Kaaterskill Clove, a deep gorge, or valley, in New York&#x27;s eastern Catskill Mountains
*Kaaterskill Creek, a tributary of Catskill Creek
*Kaaterskill Falls
*Kaaterskill High Peak, one of the Catskill Mountains
*Peekskill, New York
*Poestenkill, New York
*Schuylkill River, Pennsylvania
*Tenakill, New Jersey
*Raymondskill Falls, Pennsylvania
*Wallkill, New York
*Wynantskill, New York

The single &#x27;l&#x27; spelling of &#x27;kil&#x27; is the norm in modern Dutch geographical names, e.g. Dordtsche Kil, Sluiskil, or Kil van Hurwenen. It can occasionally be found in North America.

<text>Kruger House is the historical Pretoria residence of the Boer leader and President of the South African Republic, Paul Kruger. It was built in 1884 by architect Tom Claridge and builder Charles Clark. Milk was used, instead of water, for mixing the cement from which the house was constructed, as the cement available was of poor quality.

The house was also one of the first in Pretoria to be lit by electricity. The house contains either the original furnishings or items from the same historical period, some of the many gifts that were presented to Kruger as well as other memorabilia.

Another interesting feature of the house is two stone lions on the verandah that were presented to President Kruger as a birthday gift on 10 October 1896 by the mining magnate Barney Barnato.

The Kruger House is now a house museum that tries to recreate the ambience of the period that Kruger lived in.

== History ==
Source:

After President Kruger became a member of the Volksraad (Parliament) in 1863, he bought several plots of land on Church Street. He originally had a house to the east of today&#x27;s Kruger House Museum, and later had one to the west of it. In July 1884, the Kruger family moved into the house described in this article, which was built by the prominent businessman Alois Hugo Nellmapius. On 14 August of that year, the President hosted 60 guests, among them members of the Volksraad, lawyers, Cabinet members, and pastors at a dinner party in his &quot;new official residence.&quot;

The Kruger House displays a mix of styles. The cornice-moulded gables, the moulding on the front door, and the plastered mouldings show Late Renaissance touches, while the front and back porches show Asian influence. The house is an elongated, simple, and sturdy building. Two large drawing rooms highlight the front of the house, with four bedrooms behind. The long, broad front porch became famous as a place the President would often sit and would sometimes receive visitors.

The President and Mrs. Kruger lived for 15 years and 10 months, more or less, from July 1884 to May 1900, in the Kruger House. Their children - except for Tjaart, the youngest - were already married. On 29 May 1900, shortly before the British took Pretoria, the President left his home for the last time. His wife remained until her death in 1901. Family, friends, and sympathizers came to greet him. A boy named James F. Smith also brought 29,000 signed condolences from American boys.

Shortly before the President&#x27;s death in 1904, Frederik Christoffel Eloff, son-in-law of the President, purchased the Kruger House from the estate and registered it in the name of his son, Dirk Postma Eloff. In his absence, the house was rented out without his knowledge as a bed-and-breakfast under the name &quot;The Presidency.&quot;

President Kruger was buried in Pretoria on 16 December 1904. The funeral service was held on the grounds, between the Kruger House and the Pretoria Reformed Church (GKSA) on the opposite side of the street. Starting in April 1920, the Kruger House was leased to the Bond of Afrikaanse Moeders, a midwives&#x27; training school, as a maternity ward. Many Afrikaners can therefore boast of having born in the Kruger House between 1920 and 1932.

Meanwhile, opinion turned toward making the Kruger House a museum. When several of Kruger&#x27;s belongings were secured from the Dordrechts Museum in the Netherlands and brought back to Pretoria, this only heightened the impetus; some of these items were originally exhibited in the Old National Cultural History Museum on Boom Street.

The house was officially opened as a museum on 10 October 1934, by Mr. Albert Kuit. People connected with the President, including Mrs. LJ Jacobz, Col. Hermanus Christiaan Bredell, Dr. A. Heymans, and Miss J. van Broekhuizen, donated valuable photographs and other personal mementoes. On 6 April 1936, the house was declared a National Heritage Site. A few outbuildings have been built since then to hold the large number of Kruger memorabilia, as well as an apartment and an office. In 1952, the South African Railways and Harbours Administration donated the President&#x27;s personal train coach, which the Kruger House later exhibited in the garden under a canopy.

The Kruger House Museum has been entrusted to the National Cultural History and Open Air Museum ( or NASKO). 10 October 1984, the centennial of the house, was also the 50th anniversary of the house&#x27;s museum status.

<text>Tomaso Malvenda (1566 – 7 May 1628) was a Spanish Dominican exegete and historical critic.

==Life==
Malvenda was born in Xàtiva, Valencia. He entered the Dominicans in his youth; at the age of thirty-five, he seems to have already taught philosophy and theology. His criticisms on the &quot;Annales Ecclesiastici&quot; of Baronius, embodied in a letter to the letter to the author (1600), showed ability, and Baronius used his influence to have Malvenda summoned to Rome. Here, he was an adviser to the cardinal, while also employed in revising the Dominican Breviary, annotating Brasichelli&#x27;s &quot;Index Expurgatorius&quot;, and writing some annals of the order (they were published against his wishes and without his revision). To this period also belong his &quot;Antichristo libri XI&quot; (Rome, 1604), and &quot;De paradiso voluptatis&quot; (Rome, 1605).

Returning to Spain in 1608, Malvenda undertook a new version of the Old Testament in Latin, with commentaries. This he had carried as far as Ezechiel, xvi, 16, when he died. It gives a rendering into Latin of every word in the original; but many of the Latin words employed are intelligible only through equivalents supplied in the margin. The work was published at Lyon in 1650 as &quot;Commentaria in S. Scripturam, una cum nova de verbo in verbum ex hebraeo translatione&quot; etc.

<text>The General Secretary of the TUC is the chief permanent officer of the Trades Union Congress, and a major figurehead in the trade union movement in the United Kingdom.

The Secretary is responsible for the effective operation of the TUC and for leading implementation of policies set by the annual Congress and the organisation&#x27;s General Council. They also serve as the TUC&#x27;s chief representative, both with the public and with other organisations.

The position was formed in 1921, when the Parliamentary Committee of the TUC became the General Council. The position of Secretary has been a permanent, full-time position in the TUC since 1904. Before that, the Secretary was elected annually at Congress.

Between January 2013 and December 2022, the incumbent position was held by Frances O&#x27;Grady, the first woman to hold the post. O&#x27;Grady was succeeded by the current General Secretary, Paul Nowak – the Deputy General Secretary during O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s leadership – on 29 December 2022.

<text>Alas Chiricanas Flight 00901, registered HP-1202AC, was an Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante aircraft flying en route from Colón city to Panama City which exploded shortly after departing Enrique Adolfo Jiménez Airport, on the night of July 19, 1994. All 21 on board were killed in the bombing. Twelve of the victims were Jewish. Both Panamanian and American authorities consider the bombing an unsolved crime and an act of terrorism.

The wreckage of the Bandeirante was strewn about the Santa Rita Mountains near Colón. Panamanian investigators quickly determined that the explosion had been caused by a bomb, probably detonated by a suicide bomber aboard the aircraft. Only one body was not claimed by relatives; this body is believed to be that of a man named Jamal Lya. Officials suspected that the incident was an act of terrorism by Hezbollah directed against Jews in part because it took place one day after the AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires, and due to an expression of support by &quot;Ansar Allah&quot;, a Hezbollah affiliate in South America.

In 2018, the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela said &quot;recent evidence&quot; and intelligence reports &quot;clearly show it was a terrorist attack,&quot; and that he would ask local and international authorities to reopen the investigation. The FBI have in its investigations identified the perpetrator to have been a passenger named Ali Hawa Jamal.

<doc id="472479" wikidata="Q367643" url="?curid=472479" title="Scutigera coleoptrata">
<text>Scutigera coleoptrata, also known as the house centipede, is a species of centipede that is typically yellowish-grey and has up to 15 pairs of long legs. Originating in the Mediterranean region, it has spread to other parts of the world, where it can live in human homes. It is an insectivore; it kills and eats other arthropods, such as insects and arachnids.

== Etymology ==
In 1758, Carl Linnaeus described the species in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, giving the name &quot;Scolopendra coleoptrata&quot;, writing that it has a &quot;coleopterated thorax&quot; (similar to a coleopter). In 1801, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck separated &quot;Scutigera&quot; from &quot;Scolopendra&quot;, calling this species &quot;Scutigera coleoptrata&quot;. The word &quot;scutigera&quot; comes from Latin and , because of the shape of the plates in the back of the chilopod.

== Morphology ==
The body of an adult &quot;Scutigera coleoptrata&quot; is typically in length, although larger specimens are sometimes encountered. Up to 15 pairs of long legs are attached to the rigid body. Together with the antennae they give the centipede an appearance of being in length. The delicate legs enable it to reach surprising speeds of up to running across floors, up walls and along ceilings. Its body is yellowish-grey and has three dark dorsal stripes running down its length; the legs also have dark stripes. &quot;S. coleoptrata&quot; has developed automimicry in that its tail-like hind legs present the appearance of antennae. When the centipede is at rest, it is not easy to tell its cranial end from its caudal end.

Unlike most other centipedes, house centipedes and their close relatives have well-developed faceted eyes.

== Reproduction and development ==
House centipedes lay their eggs in spring. In a laboratory observation of 24 house centipedes, an average of 63 and a maximum of 151 eggs were laid. As with many other arthropods, the larvae look like miniature versions of the adult, albeit with fewer legs. Young centipedes have four pairs of legs when they are hatched. They gain a new pair with the first molting, and two pairs with each of their five subsequent moltings. Adults with 15 pairs of legs retain that number through three more molting stages (sequence 4-5-7-9-11-13-15-15-15-15 pairs).

House centipedes live anywhere from three to seven years, depending on the environment. They can start breeding in their third year. To begin mating, the male and female circle around each other. They initiate contact with their antennae. The male deposits his sperm on the ground and the female then uses it to fertilize her eggs.

== Behavior and ecology ==

House centipedes feed on spiders, bed bugs, termites, cockroaches, silverfish, ants, and other household arthropods. They administer venom through forcipules. These are not part of their mandibles, so strictly speaking they sting rather than bite. They are mostly nocturnal hunters. Despite their developed eyes, they seem to rely mostly on their antennae when hunting. Their antennae are sensitive to both smells and tactile information. They use both their mandibles and their legs for holding prey. This way they can deal with several small insects at the same time. To capture prey they either jump onto it or use their legs in a technique described as &quot;lassoing&quot;. Using their legs to beat prey has also been described. Like other centipedes they can stridulate.

In a feeding study, &quot;S. coleoptrata&quot; showed the ability to distinguish between possible prey, avoiding dangerous insects. They also adapted their feeding pattern to the type of hazard the prey might pose to them. For wasps, they retreat after applying the venom to give it time to take effect. When the centipede is in danger of becoming prey itself, it can detach any legs that have become trapped. House centipedes have been observed to groom their legs by curling around and grooming them with their forcipules.

In 1902, C. L. Marlatt, an entomologist with the United States Department of Agriculture, wrote a brief description of the house centipede: 

== Habitat ==
Outdoors, house centipedes prefer to live in cool, damp places. Centipede respiratory systems do not provide any mechanism for shutting the spiracles, and that is why they need an environment that protects them from dehydration and excessive cold. Most live outside, primarily under large rocks, piles of wood or leaves, in barkdust and especially in compost piles. They often emerge from hiding during the watering of gardens or flowerbeds. These centipedes can be found in almost any part of the house, although they are usually encountered in dark or dimly lit areas such as basements and garages. Inside the home, they can be found in bathrooms and lavatories, which tend to be humid, but they can also be found in drier places like offices, bedrooms and dining rooms. They are usually seen crawling along the ground or floor, but they are capable of climbing walls. The greatest likelihood of encountering them is in spring, when they emerge due to warmer weather and in autumn/fall, when the cooling weather forces them to seek shelter in human habitats.

== Distribution ==
&quot;Scutigera coleoptrata&quot; is indigenous to the Mediterranean region, but it has spread through much of Europe, Asia, North America and South America. It has also been introduced to Australia.

== Biological details ==
The faceted eyes of &quot;S. coleoptrata&quot; are sensitive to daylight and very sensitive to ultraviolet light. They were shown to be able to visually distinguish between different mutations of &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;. How this ability fits with its nocturnal lifestyle and underground natural habitat is still under study. They do not instantly change direction when light is suddenly shone at them, but will retreat to a darker hiding spot.

Some of the plates covering the body segments fused and became smaller during the evolution to the current state of &quot;S. coleoptrata&quot;. The resulting mismatch between body segments and dorsal plates (tergites) is the cause for this centipede&#x27;s rigid body.

Tergites 10 and 11 are not fully developed and segment 18 does not have a sternite. This model deviates from descriptions by Lewis who identified only 7 tergites and 15 segments.

Another feature that sets &quot;S. coleoptrata&quot; apart from other centipedes is that their hemolymph was found to contain proteins for transporting oxygen.

The mitochondrial genome of &quot;S. coleoptrata&quot; has been sequenced. This opened up discussions on the taxonomy and phylogeny of this and related species.

== Interaction with humans ==
Unlike its shorter-legged but larger tropical cousins, &quot;S. coleoptrata&quot; can live its entire life inside a building, usually on the ground levels of homes. While many homeowners may be unsettled by house centipedes due to their speed and appearance, they pose little to no threat towards humans, and are often beneficial as they catch other, more harmful pests, such as cockroaches. They are not aggressive and usually flee when disturbed or revealed from cover. Sting attempts are therefore rare unless the centipede is cornered or aggressively handled. Its small forcipules have difficulty penetrating skin, and even successful stings produce only mild, localized pain and swelling, similar to a bee sting. Allergic reactions to centipede stings have been reported, but these are rare; most stings heal quickly and without complication.

<doc id="472480" wikidata="Q4743758" url="?curid=472480" title="American Federation of Television and Radio Artists">
<text>The American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) was a performers&#x27; union that represented a wide variety of talent, including actors in radio and television, radio and television announcers and newspersons, singers and recording artists (both royalty artists and background singers), promo and voice-over announcers and other performers in commercials, stunt persons and specialty acts—as the organization itself publicly stated, &quot;AFTRA&#x27;s membership includes an array of talent&quot;. On March 30, 2012, the members of AFTRA and of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) voted to merge and form SAG-AFTRA.

==Background==
AFTRA was located at 5757 Wilshire Blvd, 7th Floor, Los Angeles, California. There were also offices in New York City, Chicago, and several other American cities. The federation as a whole had 804 employees and total assets worth $30,403,661. AFTRA worked in the interests of its members, primarily in the areas of contract negotiation and enforcement, advocacy (including lobbying, legislation and public policy issues) and member benefits such as employer-paid health plans. AFTRA was affiliated with the AFL–CIO, the International Federation of Journalists and the International Federation of Actors. AFTRA also shared jurisdiction of radio, television, Internet and other new media with its sister union SAG, while the latter was the body solely responsible for motion picture performances.

==History==
===Radio years===
Emboldened by the National Labor Relations Act passed by Congress in 1935, radio artists from Los Angeles banded together to form the Radio Actors Guild. About the same time, Broadway actor George Heller began lobbying Actors&#x27; Equity Association in New York for a contract protecting radio artists. This led to the creation of Radio Equity, existing under the umbrella of Actors&#x27; Equity.

On August 16, 1937, the American Federation of Radio Artists was formed, succeeding Radio Equity and the Radio Actors Guild. The Four As—the Associated Actors and Artistes of America—granted a charter to the new union, with 400 members in two locations. Chicago, the center for “soap opera” production, quickly followed New York and Los Angeles, with performers forming their own local chapter. By December 1937, AFRA had more than 2,000 members.

On July 12, 1938, with the support of radio stars Eddie Cantor, Edgar Bergen, Jack Benny, Bing Crosby, and others, AFRA members negotiated the first collectively bargained agreement on a national scale—with NBC and CBS—resulting in a wage increase of 125%. In 1939, after only two years in existence, AFRA covered 70% of live radio broadcasting through collective bargaining agreements.

In 1941, AFRA members negotiated the Transcription Code, providing for programs recorded for later broadcast, and building cost-of-living increases into contracts.

===Television years===
On 16 April 1950, due to a jurisdiction dispute over television performers, several unions in the entertainment industry including Chorus Equity, the American Guild of Variety Artists, the Associated Actors and Artistes of America, the American Guild of Musical Artists, and Actors&#x27; Equity Association formed the Television Authority (TVA), which negotiated the first network television contract in December.

By April 23, 1951, six Los Angeles TV stations signed contracts certifying &quot;Television Authority&quot; as their performers&#x27; sole union representative.&lt;ref name=&quot;time/0,9171,821563,00&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, the goal of a resolution from the 1947 National Convention was finally realized as AFRA negotiated the first Phonograph Recording Code for singers with the major recording labels.

On September 17, 1952, the Television Authority and AFRA merged to create a new union: the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. George Heller was the first head of AFTRA, which had nearly 10,000 members. In 1954, AFTRA negotiated the AFTRA Pension and Welfare Plan (later became the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds) which stood as the industry&#x27;s first benefit package and was negotiated into other agreements.

In 1956, early television agreements had been based on live performances, but by the mid-1950s, videotape improved to the point where programs could be broadcast repeatedly. AFTRA members negotiated the first-ever formula for payments for replay of performances, which became the basis for residuals and syndication throughout the television industry. In 1960, AFTRA and Screen Actors Guild members conducted first joint negotiations on television commercials.

In 1967, AFTRA members called the union’s first national strike on March 29, 1967, after negotiations broke down over staff announcer contracts at owned-and-operated stations in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles and over first-time contracts for “Newsmen” at networks and owned-and-operated stations. Since AFTRA adhered to a bargaining principle that no general agreement exists until all Codes and Contracts are acceptable, the 13-day strike involved all 18,000 members in more than 100 locations across the country. Agreement was reached on the outstanding issues at 8:05 p.m., EST, on Monday, April 10, 1967—just in time to allow broadcast of the annual Academy Awards program live from the Santa Monica Auditorium.

In 1974, a challenge by William F. Buckley to AFTRA&#x27;s union shop agreements for news broadcasters failed as the US Supreme Court declined to review the case. AFTRA and SAG members jointly negotiated the contract covering primetime dramatic programming on the major television networks for the first time.

In 1978, in only the second national strike in AFTRA’s history, AFTRA and SAG members struck the advertising agencies and national advertisers over the jointly negotiated Commercials Contracts.

In 1980, AFTRA and SAG members held a strike against prime time television, wanting a formula for performer participation in profits from sale of videocassettes and pay TV. In 1981, a merger of AFTRA and SAG jointly entered their &quot;Phase 1 Agreement,&quot; calling for a number of jointly negotiated, ratified, and administered contracts.

AFTRA became the target of a lawsuit by Tuesday Productions, a San Diego–based non-union jingle house, which brought anti-trust charges against the union for attempting to organize performers. A jury award for triple damages of $12 million to the company drove AFTRA into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1982. After a financial settlement by AFTRA and SAG (which is also party to the suit), AFTRA emerged from Chapter 11 in 1983 and began to rebuild. AFTRA paid no money to Tuesday Production due to declaring bankruptcy.

In 1986, a strike against network television was averted when companies backed off the demand for AFTRA news broadcasters to assume sweeping technical duties.

In 1992, as part of a coalition of recording artists, singers, musicians, and others, AFTRA members worked with Congress to enact the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992, the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998. All three laws granted a performance right in sound recordings for a wide range of digital uses, including home recording and distribution by internet, cable, and satellite. AFTRA helped develop mechanisms to assure payments to recording artists from the collection and distribution of royalties established by the laws.

In 1993, AFTRA members negotiated the first Interactive Media Agreement to cover performances in video games. In 1996, Congress passed the Telecommunications Act, opening the door for massive ownership concentration in the broadcast sector.

In 2000, AFTRA and SAG members staged a six-month strike against advertisers to gain improvements in basic cable and internet commercials, preserving established residual formulas for new media outlets.

In 2003, in a referendum on the merger of AFTRA and SAG, AFTRA members supported consolidation by more than 75%, while SAG members rejected the merger with 58% voting for it. At least 60% was required to pass, leaving a deficiency of 640 votes.

In 2005, with the digital distribution of programming by Apple iTunes and the video iPod announced in October, AFTRA joined other entertainment unions in calling for ongoing dialogue with employers to ensure fair and proper compensation for performers’ work.

In 2006, AFTRA led the campaign against relaxation of media ownership rules by the Federal Communications Commission. Through 2007, AFTRA elected leaders, members, and staff testified at numerous hearings held throughout the country and sent letters to the FCC opposing consolidation of media ownership.

AFTRA and SAG members agreed with the advertising industry to examine performer compensation models for commercials appearing on television, radio, and internet, as well as the growing array of existing and yet-to-be-developed media. The study was intended to help inform negotiations of the Commercials Contracts when the two-year extension agreement expired October 28, 2008.

==== Merger with SAG ====
The merger between AFTRA and the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) to form SAG-AFTRA was approved by the memberships of both unions with 86% and 82% support respectively on March 30, 2012.

<doc id="472483" wikidata="Q2211171" url="?curid=472483" title="Up! (album)">
<text>Up! is the fourth studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Shania Twain. It was released on November 19, 2002, by Mercury Nashville. Three versions of the album were released: a pop version (red disc), a country version (green disc), and a version in the style of Indian film music (blue disc). This was the last album of Twain&#x27;s career (excluding her 2004 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; collection) to be produced by her then-husband Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange before their divorce and her last studio release until 2017&#x27;s &quot;Now&quot;. 

The album became a commercial success, albeit less successful than &quot;Come On Over&quot;. &quot;Up!&quot; gave Twain her best first week sales in the United States, debuting at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Top Country Albums charts, later becoming the best-selling country album of 2003 in the US and third overall among all genres. Internationally, &quot;Up!&quot; was a commercial success, entering the top ten in almost all the markets it entered and topped the charts in Australia, Twain&#x27;s native Canada, Germany, New Zealand, and the UK country charts. On September 23, 2004, the RIAA certified &quot;Up!&quot; at eleven-times platinum, giving her the distinction of being the only female artist to have three consecutive diamond albums released in the United States. The album was promoted with multiple interviews and live performances including the 2003 Super Bowl halftime show and the successful Up! Tour. 

Eight singles were released from the album, although no country received all eight of them. &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Getcha Good!&quot; became a top-ten success across Europe while also hitting number seven on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart. &quot;Up!&quot; reached the top-20 of the country airplay chart while hitting the top five in Canada and Hungary. The Europe-exclusive &quot;Ka-Ching!&quot; became Twain&#x27;s biggest success in the continent while &quot;Forever and for Always&quot; was the album&#x27;s best-performing single on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Thank You Baby!&quot; was a moderate hit in Europe. &quot;When You Kiss Me&quot; was released as a double A-side with &quot;Up!&quot;, reaching the top-forty in the United Kingdom. &quot;She&#x27;s Not Just a Pretty Face&quot; would be Twain&#x27;s last solo top-ten hit on the country charts while &quot;It Only Hurts When I&#x27;m Breathing&quot; became a minor top-twenty Adult Contemporary hit.

== Production ==
Writing and recording for the album took place around the world. According to the album booklet, Twain and Lange wrote and recorded in Berlin, Rome, Vienna, Paris, Avignon, Provence, Milan, Dublin, the Bahamas (at the famous Compass Point Studios), The Grenadine Islands, and Mumbai. For the blue international disc, the pair enlisted British-Asian music producers Simon and Diamond Duggal for production collaboration. Canadian folk music group Leahy provided group fiddles throughout the album.

== Release and promotion ==
When the album was originally released, different regions received different versions of the album. North America received a two-disc set, containing the red disc and the green disc. Most international markets received a two-disc set, referred to as the &quot;International Version,&quot; containing the red disc and the blue disc. Both two-disc versions contain a note from Shania offering free downloads of whichever set of mixes not included (e.g. a download of the blue version is offered with the red/green set), for a limited time on her website. Australia received both two-disc sets, with the red/green version being subtitled &quot;U.S. Version&quot;. The album was later re-released in some territories as a single-disc set, containing only the red mixes, and an alternate cover with a red background.

The red and green versions were released on vinyl in the United States and Europe on October 14, 2016. They are sold separately, and are featured on translucent red and green vinyl, respectively. This marks the first time the green version was released physically in Europe.

Twain launched an extensive promotional tour for the album, starting in October 2002. Major events included the Super Bowl XXXVII halftime show, the 2002 and 2003 Country Music Association Awards, the 2003 American Music Awards, the 2003 Juno Awards, the 2003 ECHO Awards, the 2003 Billboard Music Awards, and the 2003 CMT Flameworthy Awards.

On October 2, 2002, Twain performed on the Dutch program &quot;TROS TV Show&quot;. On October 5 she appeared on &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot;. On October 19 she appeared on the BBC show &quot;Parkinson&quot; and on France&#x27;s &quot;Star Academy&quot;. On October 26 she filmed a mini-concert for &quot;&quot;. On November 6, she launched the US leg of the promotional tour by opening the 2002 Country Music Awards. On November 24, Twain performed in Edmonton at the 2002 Grey Cup halftime show.

Twain embarked on the successful Up! Tour in September 2003. In 2007, the album&#x27;s cover was listed on &quot;Maxim&quot;″s Sexiest Album Covers.

== Critical reception ==

Upon its release, the album received positive reviews from most music critics, based on an aggregate score of 72/100 from Metacritic. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated it 4.5/5 stars, praising Twain for: &quot;writing well crafted songs as universal anthems, so listeners can hear themselves within these tales.&quot; Erlewine further commented that: &quot;The album had big, polished, multipurpose hooks and big, sweeping emotions. This is Super-Size pop, as outsized and grandiose as good pop should be&quot;, he concluded. Matthew Bjorke from About.com rated it four-stars out of five and said that: &quot;This 19 track opus is sure to please most fans of both pop and modern country.&quot; The &quot;Blender&quot; review was also positive, saying that: &quot;Twain&#x27;s songs are never deep, but they have hooks tattooed on their skin and harmonies that glow like bar lights.&quot; Also with a positive review, &quot;Billboard&quot; said that: &quot;[It&#x27;s] quintessential Shania, light as vapor, sweet as sugar, rendered with personality and undeniable charisma. Expect precious metal.&quot; Andrew Lynch from Entertainment.ie rated it three-stars out of five and said that: &quot;The songs, themselves, meanwhile, are as bland and one-dimensional as they were on the smash hit &quot;Come on Over&quot;, sassily upbeat stuff with a dash of girl power thrown in for good measure. A high proportion of them, however, are also infuriatingly catchy – suggesting that Twain may well have another global success on her hands.&quot;

Chris Willman from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; was largely positive with the album, gaving an &quot;A&quot; grade for the album, comparing the album to &quot;ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Gold&quot; without all the melancholy.&quot; He also complemented &quot;the sheer exuberance and joy of craftsmanship in this double-&quot;Up!&quot;-manship don&#x27;t feel like mercenary insincerity. They resemble something like actual generosity... not to put too fine a point on it.&quot; The PopMatters review was average, giving it six stars out of ten and saying that the album &quot;got everything from dance numbers to ballads, and it&#x27;s vintage Shania&quot;. The review further said that: &quot;Up! is a sense of Twain trying – desperately trying at all levels – to touch everyone, to express universal truths by artificial means: beats, tempos, instruments, etc.&quot; The review concluded that: &quot;Up! is too generic and emotionless for that level of diversity, but in a very real sense, Twain has taken country music to its next level of popularity where country and pop are virtually indistinguishable.&quot; Robert Christgau on his Consumer Guide Review praised the tracks &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Getcha Good! &quot; and &quot;Ka-Ching!&quot;. The &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review was positive, rating it four-stars out of five and saying that: &quot;Up! would be a knockout even if it were limited to its one disc of country music... But the second, relentlessly kinetic pop disc is a revelation.&quot; Jennifer Nine from Yahoo! Music rated it six-stars out of ten, saying that: &quot;&#x27;Up!&#x27; is not without its little oddities and delights.&quot; And concluded that: &quot;&#x27;Up!&#x27; takes on its all-things-to-all-wallets mission with real appetite.&quot; Alanna Nash from Amazon was largely positive and concluded that: &quot;There&#x27;s something oddly hypnotic about much of this project, and it may be simply hearing what Shania can do when she abandons the pretense of being a country singer and concentrates on music. Call this a guilty pleasure—pop, country, or somewhere in between.&quot;

== Commercial performance ==
&quot;Up!&quot; debuted at No. 1 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart and the all-genre &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 874,000 copies in its first week of release. In its second week, it remained at the top spot on both charts, selling 623,000 copies. In its third week, sales were still strong enough to top both charts again, selling more than 317,000 copies and beating Tim McGraw&#x27;s &quot;Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors&quot;, which held the No. 2 spot for a second consecutive week. The album remained at No. 1 after its fourth week of release, selling more than 373,000 copies. Its last reign on the all-genre chart was after its fifth week. The album&#x27;s five-week total alone stands at an estimated 2,646,000 units. The RIAA certified the album 11× platinum (Diamond), denoting shipments of 5.5 million in the United States; the RIAA counts each disc separately for certification purposes. It stayed in the Top 200 of the &quot;Billboard top 200 albums sales&quot; chart for more than 60 weeks.
In Canada, the album debuted at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, with first-week sales of 150,000 copies. &quot;Up!&quot; was also the best selling album in Canada for the year 2002 selling 580,690 according to Soundscan. The album was certified diamond in Canada 17 days after its release.
