<doc id="474497" wikidata="Q1741678" url="?curid=474497" title="List of films based on English-language comics">
<text>This is a list of films based on English-language comics, including comic books, graphic novels, and features in anthology comics magazines. It includes films that are adaptations of English-language comics, and those films whose characters originated in comic books (e.g. &quot;Batman&quot; is not an adaptation of one particular comic book, but the character first appeared in comic books, not in another medium). It also includes film serials. It does not include material where the original source is newspaper comic strips, which is featured on a separate list.

All films categorized by character listed chronologically.

<text>Woodland Park Zoo is a wildlife conservation organization and zoological garden located in the Phinney Ridge neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, United States. The zoo is the recipient of over 65 awards across multiple categories. The zoo has around 900 animals from 250 species and the zoo has over 1 million visitors a year.

== History ==

Occupying the western half of Woodland Park, the zoo began as a small menagerie on the estate of Guy C. Phinney, a Canadian-born lumber mill owner and real estate developer. Six years after Phinney&#x27;s death, on December 28, 1899, Phinney&#x27;s wife sold the Woodland Park to the city for $5,000 in cash and the assumption of a $95,000 mortgage. The sum was so large that then-mayor W. D. Wood vetoed the acquisition, only to be later overruled by the city council. In 1902, the Olmsted Brothers firm of Boston was hired to design the city&#x27;s parks, including Woodland Park, and the next year the collection of the private Leschi Park menagerie was moved to Phinney Ridge.

An expansion of the zoo was approved in 1968 as part of the Forward Thrust ballot measures and resulted in a master plan designed by architect George Bartholick, which included a lid over Aurora Avenue and new exhibits to the east in Woodland Park. The plan was opposed by local residents and rejected in a citywide ballot initiative in November 1974.

In 1975, David Hancocks, the then-director of the Woodland Park Zoo, redesigned the zoo&#x27;s gorilla exhibit to form what became referred to as landscape immersion exhibits, in which animals would become immersed in landscapes that represented their natural habitats as closely as possible, while visitors would also be immersed in the same replicated habitat. The habitat was designed with natural plants and rockwork, with special consideration being put towards the acoustic treatment of the exhibit to make the environment soft and quiet. Initially the idea was heavily criticized, with many experts being concerned about the maintenance of vegetation and lack of visibility, as well as the temperate environment of Washington negatively affecting the soil. The idea eventually became the standard for naturalistic exhibits, inspiring many imitators and replicas worldwide.

==Layout and features==

, the zoo featured of exhibits, public spaces, parking, and playgrounds. Open to the public daily, it received 1.05 million visitors in 2006. Its collection includes:
* 1,090 animal specimens
* 300 animal species
* 35 endangered and 5 threatened animal species
* 7,000 trees
* 50,000+ shrubs and herbs
* 1,000+ plant species
* A sensory garden

==Exhibits==

Woodland Park Zoo is a recipient of several Best National Exhibit awards from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, and ranks second after the Bronx Zoo in New York City for the number received. Woodland Park Zoo created what is generally considered the world&#x27;s first immersion exhibit, a gorilla habitat, which opened in the late 1970s under the direction of zoo architect David Hancocks. Other exhibits include:
*Tropical Asia is the zoo&#x27;s largest section, focusing on South and Southeast Asia, and is split into three areas. The first is Assam Rhino Reserve which is mostly composed of a large exhibit containing the zoo&#x27;s Indian rhinoceroses. The second area is Bayan Wilds and is home to Malayan tigers, sloth bears, Asian small-clawed otters, and a small aviary. The third section is The Trail of Vines and houses orangutans, siamangs, pythons, and Malayan tapir. The Rhino Reserve was previously the Elephant Forest but was rethemed following the phasing out of the zoo&#x27;s elephant program in April 2015.
*The African Savanna section houses animals native to the grasslands of Africa. The largest exhibit is an area for herbivores, home to giraffes, zebras, and ostrich. There are as well enclosures for hippo, African lion, warthog, Patas monkey, and a small aviary for savanna birds. The area also contains a recreation of an East African village. The African Savanna won the AZA exhibit award in 1981.
*Australasia is home to the zoo&#x27;s Australian species. There is an outdoor exhibit shared by emu, common wallaroo, and red-necked wallaby. Next to it is Willawong Station, housing several species of Australian parrot, which visitors may feed with a seed stick for a small fee. There is a snow leopard enclosure next door.
*The Living Northwest Trail habitat focuses upon the animals of the taiga of Northwestern America. Exhibits include grizzly bear, mountain goat, elk, River Otter, Steller&#x27;s Sea Eagle, and wolf. This area is modeled off a real trail in Alaska&#x27;s Denali National Park and won the AZA Exhibit Award in 1995.
*Tropical Rainforest explores the animals of South America and Africa&#x27;s jungles. The South American section has a jaguar exhibit. The African section contains western lowland gorillas, ring-tailed lemurs, red ruffed lemurs, and colobus monkeys. Tropical Rainforest was the recipient of the AZA Exhibit Award in 1993.
*Temperate Forest showcases creatures of the world&#x27;s temperate woodlands. Exhibits include southern pudu, red panda, Chilean flamingo Red-crowned cranes, White-naped cranes, Maned wolves, a wetlands area, and a conservation aviary for rare birds. There is also a Bug House, home to the zoo&#x27;s Partula Snails and a farm exhibit, allowing guests to pet domesticated animals such as Kunekune pigs, Sheep, Goats, and Miniature Jersey Steer.
*The penguin enclosure houses a colony of several dozen Humboldt penguins. The exhibit was remodeled in 2009 to allow underwater viewing of the birds and better theming to their natural habitat; it also now runs on green energy. The new penguin habitat received the AZA Top Honor Award in 2010.
*There is also a butterfly garden, a raptor center housing various birds of prey, and the Trail of Adaptations building that is home to Komodo dragon, and meerkat. Several species are kept offview from visitors including tree kangaroos and Indian Peafowl that roam freely around the Zoo Grounds.
*The zoo contains an indoor children&#x27;s play area called Zoomazium, encouraging exploration, exercise, education, and fun for young children. An old-fashioned carousel retooled to run on solar energy is also featured. This merry-go-round (PTC #45) was first built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company for the Cincinnati Zoo in 1918, it was refurbished and donated to Woodland Park Zoo by Alleniana Foundation.

==Community engagement==
Woodland Park Zoo has been an active member of environmental and ecological conservation efforts across the U.S. Besides operating its own educational programs for school children, the park also cooperates with many of the higher education institutions in state, such as the University of Washington. On January 5, 2010, the zoo announced that due to the &quot;difficult economy,&quot; it would be closing its Night Exhibit.

==Fundraisers==

ZooTunes, a summer concert series, has been held at the zoo since 1983 and raises funds for various zoo programs and activities. For the event, the zoo&#x27;s North Meadow is turned into an outdoor amphitheater that accommodates 3,700 attendees.

==Notable animals==

From 1953 to 1968, Woodland Park Zoo was home to Bobo, a western lowland gorilla (&quot;Gorilla gorilla gorilla&quot;, the same species as the gorillas currently living at the zoo). Bobo was acquired from the Lowman family of Anacortes, Washington, who had purchased the gorilla as an infant from a hunter in Columbus, Ohio, in 1951 and had raised him in their family home in Anacortes. Bobo drew many visitors to the zoo and was one of Seattle&#x27;s main attractions in the years preceding the construction of Seattle Center and the expansion of major-league professional sports into the city. His popularity is credited with helping the zoo obtain funding to build a new primate house.

Anthropologist Dawn Prince-Hughes spent many years working at Woodland Park Zoo and observing the western lowland gorillas there, which she wrote about in her book &quot;Songs of the Gorilla Nation: My Journey Through Autism&quot;.

Two lionesses named Busela (Seyla) and Nobuhle (Nabu) were transferred from the zoo to Hogle Zoo in Salt Lake City, Utah, to breed with the Montgomery Zoo&#x27;s two male lions, Baron and Vulcan. On February 24, 2016, Nabu gave birth to two males, Brutus and Titus, and a female, Calliope. Baron fathered the three cubs.

In December 2015, a baby gorilla, Yola, was born at the zoo. She is the first child of Nadiri who was also born there.

On June 20, 2017, the baby giraffe Lulu was born, standing 5&#x27;7&quot; and weighing 149 lbs. The daughter of Tufani and Dave, she is a mixture of the reticulated and South African giraffe subspecies. Her naming rights were auctioned off at the zoo&#x27;s Jungle Safari Party fundraiser. A male snow leopard cub was also born at the zoo that summer; he was given the name of Aibeck, meaning &quot;long life&quot; in Kyrgyz.

In July and October 2022 two brown bear cubs, Juniper and Fern, were transferred to the zoo from Alaska and Montana respectively. Both bears are female and were orphaned as young cubs.

==Conservation==
The Woodland Park Zoo works in collaboration with the Oregon Zoo, government agencies such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and conservation organizations on recovery projects for many threatened and endangered species, such as the Oregon silverspot butterfly, and western pond turtle.

<doc id="474505" wikidata="Q1471650" url="?curid=474505" title="Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III">
<text>The Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III is a black limestone Neo-Assyrian sculpture with many scenes in bas-relief and inscriptions. It comes from Nimrud (ancient Kalhu), in northern Iraq, and commemorates the deeds of King Shalmaneser III (reigned 858–824 BC). It is on display at the British Museum in London, and several other museums have cast replicas.

It is one of two complete Neo-Assyrian obelisks yet discovered, the other one being the much earlier White Obelisk of Ashurnasirpal I, and is historically significant because it is thought to display the earliest ancient depiction of a biblical figure – Jehu, King of Israel. The traditional identification of &quot;Yaw&quot; as Jehu has been questioned by some scholars, who proposed that the inscription refers to another king, Jehoram of Israel. Its reference to &quot;Parsua&quot; is also the first known reference to the Persians.

Tribute offerings are shown being brought from identifiable regions and peoples. It was erected as a public monument in 825 BC at a time of civil war, in the central square of Nimrud. It was discovered by archaeologist Sir Austen Henry Layard in 1846 and is now in the British Museum.

==Description==
It features twenty relief scenes, five on each side. They depict five different subdued kings, bringing tribute and prostrating before the Neo-Assyrian king. From top to bottom they are: (1) Sua of Gilzanu (in north-west Iran), (2) &quot;Yaua of Bit Omri&quot; (Jehu of the House of Omri), (3) an unnamed ruler of Musri (in northern Iraq), (4) Marduk-apil-usur of Suhi (middle Euphrates), and (5) Qalparunda of Patin (Antakya region of Turkey). Each scene occupies four panels around the monument and is described by a cuneiform script above them.

On the top and the bottom of the reliefs there is a long cuneiform inscription recording the annals of Shalmaneser III. It lists the military campaigns which the king and his commander-in-chief headed every year, until the thirty-first year of reign. Some features might suggest that the work had been commissioned by the commander-in-chief, Dayyan-Assur.

==Second register==
The second register from the top is thought to include the earliest surviving picture of a biblical figure. The name appears as &quot;mIa-ú-a mar mHu-um-ri-i&quot;. Rawlinson&#x27;s original translation in 1850 seminal work &quot;On the Inscriptions of Assyria and Babylonia&quot; stated: &quot;The second line of offerings are said to have been sent by Yahua, son of Hubiri, a prince of whom there is no mention in the annals, and of whose native country, therefore, I am ignorant&quot; Over a year later, a connection with the bible was made by Reverend Edward Hincks, who wrote in his diary on 21 August 1851: &quot;Thought of an identification of one of the obelisk captives — with Jehu, king of Israel, and satisfying myself on the point wrote a letter to the Athenaeum announcing it&quot;. Hincks&#x27; letter was published by Athenaeum on the same day, entitled &quot;Nimrud Obelisk&quot;. Hincks&#x27; identification is now the commonly held position by biblical archaeologists.

The identification of &quot;Yahua&quot; as Jehu was questioned by contemporary scholars such as George Smith as well as in more recent times by P. Kyle McCarter and Edwin R. Thiele, based on the fact that Jehu was not an Omride, as well as transliteration and chronology issues. However, the name read as &quot;Yaw, son of Omri (Bit-Khumri&quot;, see House of Omri), is generally accepted to follow Hincks as the Biblical Jehu, king of Israel.

The stele describes how Jehu brought or sent his tribute in or around 841 BC. The caption above the scene, written in Assyrian cuneiform, can be translated:

&quot;“I received the tribute of Iaua (Jehu) son of (the people of the land of) Omri (): silver, gold, a golden bowl, a golden vase with pointed bottom, golden tumblers, golden buckets, tin, a staff for a king [and] spears.&quot;&quot;

<text>Anton Flettner, Flugzeugbau GmbH was a German helicopter and autogyro manufacturer during World War II, founded by Anton Flettner.

Flettner aircraft included:
*Flettner Fl 184 - Reconnaissance autogyro, prototype
*Flettner Fl 185 - Reconnaissance helicopter, prototype
*Flettner Fl 265 - Reconnaissance helicopter, prototype
*Flettner Fl 282 &quot;Kolibri&quot; (Hummingbird) - Reconnaissance helicopter
*Flettner Fl 339 - Reconnaissance helicopter, project
*Flettner Gigant - Experimental helicopter

Anton Flettner&#x27;s interest in aerodynamics (specifically the Magnus effect, which produces a force from a cylinder rotating in a fluid flow) also led him to invent the Flettner rotor which he used to power a Flettner ship which crossed the Atlantic, and the Flettner ventilator which is still widely used as a cooling device for buses, vans and other commercial vehicles and which is based upon the Savonius principle.

<text>The Klemm Leichtflugzeugbau GmbH (&quot;Klemm Light Aircraft Company&quot;) was a German aircraft manufacturer noteworthy for sports and touring planes of the 1930s.

The company was founded in Böblingen in 1926 by Dr. Hanns Klemm, who had previously worked for both Zeppelin and the Daimler Aircraft Company.

==History==
While working at Daimler, Klemm had developed his ideas for a light aircraft, to be made of wood for strength and lightness. It should be easy to manufacture, aerodynamically efficient with low mass and wing loading, for which a low-powered engine would be sufficient. Klemm&#x27;s first design, the Daimler L.15, was a light aircraft with a single 7.5 hp (5.5 kW) Indian motorcycle engine. This aircraft flew in early 1919, although a 12 hp (8.8 kW) Harley-Davidson engine was used instead of the originally-envisioned engine.

Klemm then designed a squared-off version of the cylindrical fuselage of the L.15, which could be more easily built, which he designated the L.20, and he founded his own company to produce it. This aircraft, of which more than 100 were built, was powered by a 20 hp (15 kW) Daimler engine designed by Ferdinand Porsche.

In 1928 Friedrich Karl von Koenig-Warthausen made a solo flight to Moscow in a Klemm L.20, then decided to keep on going, circumnavigating the world and earning himself the Hindenburg Cup, the highest German honour for aeronautical achievement.

From the L.20 was developed the Klemm L.25, later redesignated the Kl 25. Capable of being fitted with fourteen different engine types, over 600 were sold, and licenses to manufacture them were issued in Great Britain and the United States.

In January 1930 Mohamed Sidki flew from Berlin to Cairo, Egypt in a Klemm L25a. He landed in Cairo on 26 January, becoming a political hero by defying the British authorities who had denied him permission to land (he became known as &quot;The First Egyptian Eagle&quot;). Sidki wrote a letter to Klemm, who had helped outfit the plane for the long journey, stating &quot;your beautiful little machine, the L25a has carried me through wind, snow and torrential rain without any damage to myself, the plane and the engine.&quot;

In 1931 Elly Beinhorn became the second woman to fly from Europe to Australia flying a Klemm Kl 26 equipped with an Argus engine, and winning the Hindenburg Cup.

Klemm suffered a setback in 1935 when the prototype Kl 35 crashed during testing at Rechlin. This was explained as a material defect, but was more likely due to overstressing of the wings. Klemm revised and brought the Kl 35 up to the required specifications and manufacturing began. Around 2,000 of the aircraft were built, both at Klemm&#x27;s plant, and by Fieseler, and later by the Czech company Moravan Otrokovice, for the Luftwaffe as a trainer. During World War II Klemm produced and designed a range of aircraft, such as the Klemm Kl 105, Kl 106 and Kl 107, as well as the Klemm Kl 151 and Kl 152.

The Klemm Aircraft Company was refounded in 1952 after the post-war ban on aircraft construction was lifted. Klemm himself by this time was semi-retired, and the company was run by his son Hanns-Jürgen Klemm. This company&#x27;s first model, Kl 107-A, made its maiden flight in mid-1956. In April 1959, Bölkow took over Klemm, and with the successor of the Kl 107-C named the Bölkow 207, the name of Klemm disappeared from the list of aircraft manufacturers.

==Aircraft==
Klemm aircraft included:

* Klemm (Daimler) L.20, light leisure and training aircraft, 1924
* Klemm Kl 25, light leisure and training aircraft, 1928
* Klemm Kl 26, light leisure and training aircraft, 1929
* Klemm Kl 31, single-engine transport, 1931
* Klemm Kl 32, single-engine transport, 1931
* Klemm Kl 33, (Klemm L33), single-seat ultra-light sportplane (prototype), 1933
* Klemm Kl 35, sportplane and trainer, 1935
* Klemm Kl 36, single-engine transport, 1934
* Klemm Kl 105, touring plane, development of Kl 35 (prototypes)
* Klemm Kl 106, sportsplane, development of Kl 35 (prototypes)
* Klemm Kl 107, light leisure and training aircraft

<text>Hilda de Almeida Prado Hilst (21 April 1930 – 4 February 2004) was a Brazilian poet, novelist, and playwright. Her work touches on the themes of mysticism, insanity, the body, eroticism, and female sexual liberation. Hilst greatly revered the work of James Joyce and Samuel Beckett, and the influence of their styles—like stream of consciousness and fractured reality—is evident in her own work.

Born in Jaú, São Paulo, Hilst graduated from the University of São Paulo in 1952. While studying there, she published her first book of poems, &quot;Omen&quot; (), in 1950. After a brief trip to Europe, Hilst was influenced by Nikos Kazantzakis&#x27; &quot;Report to Greco&quot; to move away from the São Paulo scene, and she secluded herself in an estate near the outskirts of Campinas. Deciding to devote her life to her literary creations, she constructed the House of the Sun (), where she would invite several artists and intellectuals to live. 

Writing forty works over her lifetime, she was one of the most prolific writers of her generation. Her works were mostly not well known outside of her home country until after her death, when several of her books were translated to English.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Hilda de Almeida Prado Hilst was the only daughter of Apolônio de Almeida Prado Hilst and Bedecilda Vaz Cardoso. Her father owned a coffee plantation and also worked as a journalist, poet, and essayist. He was affected by schizophrenia throughout his life. Her mother came from a conservative Portuguese immigrant family. The conditions of her parents&#x27; mental health (and the relationships they had with mental health) greatly influenced Hilst&#x27;s writing, and her books describe several experiences she had with her father. Her parents separated in 1932 while she was still an infant, and three years later her father received the diagnosis of schizophrenia and thereafter spent much of his life in mental institutions. Her mother was also institutionalized at the end of her life, in the same institution as her husband.

Hilst grew up in Jaú, a town in the state of São Paulo, with her mother and half brother from her mother&#x27;s previous marriage. Hilst attended elementary and high school at Collegia Santa Marcelina in São Paulo before enrolling in a bachelor&#x27;s degree program at Mackenzie Presbyterian University. Before Hilst started college, her mother told her of her father&#x27;s condition, and Hilst went to visit him in a mental institution for the first time.

After graduating from Mackenzie, Hilst began studying for her second degree at the law school at the University of São Paulo, where she met her lifelong friend Lygia Fagundes.

===Early career===
Hilst published her first book of poetry in 1950, &quot;Omen&quot; (), which received great acclaim from her contemporaries like Jorge de Lima and Cecília Meireles. It was not long before she published her second book, &quot;Ballad of Alzira&quot; () in 1951. That same year Hilst took over guardianship of her father. Later in 1957, Hilst began her seven-month tour of Europe, traveling through France, Italy and Greece. There, she briefly dated singer-actor Dean Martin and impersonated a journalist, in an attempt to meet Marlon Brando. She asked him about his thoughts on Franz Kafka&#x27;s works, to which he dismissively replied, &quot;I won&#x27;t think about Mr. Kafka&quot;.

Upon her return to São Paulo, she settled in the Sumaré neighborhood, and was frequently in the company of other artists, such as Gilka Machado and Bráulio Pedroso. However, after reading Nikos Kazantzakis&#x27; &quot;Report to Greco&quot;, and being influenced by its themes of self-isolation to achieve knowledge of the human being, Hilst decided to leave São Paulo in 1964 and return to her childhood home in Campinas.

She ordered the construction of a new house on the same property, nicknamed the House of the Sun (), which she personally designed to be an artistic space for inspiration and creativity. When it was completed in 1966, she moved into the house with sculptor Dante Casarini, with whom she had a prior relationship. In September of the same year, her father died.

===Theater and prose===
At the House of the Sun, Hilst was particularly prolific as she started writing her first theater works, completing nine plays and one poetry compilation between 1967 and 1969. She married Casarini in 1968. Although the marriage only lasted twelve years, the two continued to live together in the House of the Sun. Hilst lived somewhat secluded in Campinas for the rest of her life, accompanied by other artists. The House of the Sun became a hub for artists and writers, who were invited to spend time there and enjoy the creative atmosphere. Two prominent artists to do so were Bruno Tolentino and Caio Fernando Abreu. During her time at the House of the Sun, Hilst also engaged in her own experiments with electronic voice phenomena, an electronic recording method that supposedly interprets the voices of the dead. In 1969, she built a second home, the . Her theater writings finished in the same year, with her turning instead to prose fiction with her experimental text a year later.

===Later years===
In the 1980s, due to increasing financial pressure from a lack of book sales, Hilst participated in the (Artist-in-Residence program), at the Universidade Estadual de Campinas, being the first artist to do so. The program was conceived as a way for students to meet established authors. She later held other teaching positions at the university.

Hilst published &quot;Lori Lamby&#x27;s Pink Notebook&quot; () in 1990, the first book of a pornographic tetralogy. She announced her &quot;goodbye to serious literature&quot; in the 1990s because she was &quot;irritated by the meager reaching of her writing&quot;.

A number of Hilst&#x27;s books were originally published by smaller Brazilian publishers, but beginning in 2001, Editora Globo, the publishing branch of the Brazilian media organization Globo, began reissuing nearly all her works, as part of its . She stopped writing in the same year, telling an interviewer that she had said everything she wanted to say.

===Death===
Hilst died on 4 February 2004, in Campinas at the age of 73. She had been hospitalized at the Hospital das Clínicas da Unicamp since 2 January, following surgery for a fractured femur. Her health sharply declined after contracting an infection, aggravated by a chronic heart and pulmonary condition, before she eventually passed away due to multiple organ failure. Following her death, Hilst&#x27;s friend Mora Fuentes created the Hilda Hilst Institute in her honor, an organization whose mission is to uphold the House of the Sun as a space for artistic creation and serves as a library and cultural center. Author Yuri Vieira, who lived in the House of the Sun for two years, wrote a book about his experiences there.

After her death, Hilst garnered more fame among English language readership as several of her novels were translated to the language, such as &quot;With My Dog Eyes&quot;, &quot;The Obscene Madame D.&quot;, and &quot;Letters from a Seducer&quot;.

==Themes==
Hilda Hilst wrote for almost 50 years, publishing forty books over her lifetime. The different periods of her life are reflected in the phases of her work: she began as a poet, publishing in 1950, through the time before she moved into the House of the Sun; around the death of her father and her marriage, she started publishing and staging plays in 1967; and shifted into prose in 1970, with her experimental text . Throughout her career, beginning in 1958 with Adoniran Barbosa, musicians selected poems of hers to be set to music. Relatively obscure in her lifetime, her work has since been extensively studied and analyzed after her death. She has been highly referenced in books, magazines, academic journals, and others.

In several of her writings Hilst tackled politically and socially controversial issues, such as obscenity, queer sexuality, and incest. The tetralogy that comprises &quot;Lori Lamby&#x27;s Pink Notebook&quot; () and &quot;Tales of Derision: Grotesque Texts&quot; () (1990); (1991); and (1992), includes overtly pornographic material, if not pornography &quot;per se&quot;. Her pornographic work started as a response to the minimal popularity her previous works had with the general audience. She explored theological issues in her work as well, particularly regarding God and the &quot;search of the divine&quot;. Other common themes in her writings include madness, old age, love, and death.

In Hilst&#x27;s prose fiction, she employs several narrative features to build the narrative, including passages of metanarrative discourse; soliloquies; simulacra of dramatic theatrical texts; colloquial register of regional linguistic variants; words, expressions and quotations from foreign literary works in the language of origin – in English and Latin; stream of consciousness and fractured reality; sparse notes; poems; letters and questions addressed directly to the reader. She was greatly influenced by the works of James Joyce and Samuel Beckett, whom she greatly revered.

==Honors==
In 1962 she won the Prêmio PEN Clube of São Paulo, for (Massao Ohno Editor, 1962). In 1969, the play took the Prêmio Anchieta, one of the most important cultural awards in the country at the time. The Brazilian Association of Art Critics (APCA Prize) deemed (Edições Quíron, 1977) the best book of the year. In 1981, Hilda Hilst won the , by the same association. In 1984, the awarded her the Jabuti Prize for , and the following year the same book claimed the Prêmio Cassiano Ricardo (Clube de Poesia de São Paulo). , published in 1993, took the Jabuti Prize for best short story, and finally, on 9 August 2002, she was awarded at the 47th edition of Prêmio Moinho Santista in the poetry category.

==Translation==
Some of Hilst&#x27;s texts have been translated from Brazilian Portuguese to French, English, Italian and German. In March 1997, her works and were published by Éditions Gallimard, translated by Maryvonne Lapouge. The latter was translated into English as &quot;The Obscene Madame D&quot; collaboratively by Nathanaël and Rachel Gontijo Araújo, and published jointly by Nightboat Books in New York and A Bolha Editora in Rio de Janeiro in 2012. In 2014, &quot;Letters from a Seducer&quot;, John Keene&#x27;s translation of the 1991 novel , was published by Nightboat Books and A Bolha Editora, and &quot;With My Dog Eyes&quot;, Adam Morris&#x27;s translation of Hilst&#x27;s 1986 novella , was published by Melville House.

<doc id="474512" wikidata="Q3519681" url="?curid=474512" title="The 'Nam">
<text>The &#x27;Nam is a war comic book series detailing the U.S. war in Vietnam from the perspective of active-duty soldiers involved in the conflict. It was initially written by Doug Murray, illustrated by Michael Golden and edited by Larry Hama, and was published by Marvel Comics for seven years beginning in 1986, which was intended to roughly parallel the analogous events of the period of major American military involvement in Vietnam from 1965 to 1973.

==Plot==
The comic was initially structured as the narrative of a fictional soldier, Private First Class Edward Marks (but sometimes following other characters), as he experiences real events that occurred during the conflict. Each issue of the comic occurs one month after the previous issue, detailing events that occurred approximately 20 years prior to the publication date.

The events depicted are sometimes famous ones, such as the Tet Offensive of 1968, and sometimes more personal ones, depicting the interaction between soldiers or between soldiers and the local populace of Vietnam, or between soldiers and their families, friends and others in the United States.

Some of the stories are typical of those in war comics of any era, such as the interaction with a callous officer or a description of combat, while others are unique to Vietnam, such as the experience of soldiers on leave bearing the personal burden of animosity from civilians opposed to the war. Issue #8 introduced the character of Frank Verzyl, the Tunnel Rat, who appeared again briefly in #26.

==Publication history==
===Background and concept===
Vietnam War veteran Larry Hama contacted fellow vet Doug Murray in 1984 about doing a Vietnam War series for his black-and-white magazine, &quot;Savage Tales&quot; Vol. 2. Hama teamed Murray up with artist Michael Golden and together they created &quot;The 5th to the 1st&quot;, which was well received.

In 1986, Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Jim Shooter approached Hama with a mock-up of a comic book cover that was, as Hama remembers, &quot;a color copy of the artwork from a &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; cover, one that showed an Infantryman in camo face paint peering through dense jungle foliage. A logo had been pasted over the art that read: THE &#x27;NAM.&quot; Shooter told Hama to come up with a book to go along with the cover and produce it. Hama suggested that Murray put together a proposal for a regular comic book about the Vietnam War. Hama specified that the series would play out in real time, such that no one character would remain in the series for longer than 12 issues (since during the Vietnam War soldiers returned home after the completion of a 364-day tour of duty), and that it should be as realistic as possible. Murray has stated that having the series take place in real time was a joint decision between him and Hama. He said, &quot;[l]iterally everybody had a calendar that kept track of how long they had to go in-country. I really wanted a way to kind of reflect that in the comic book.&quot; Though he chose Murray and Golden for the series in part because of their having done &quot;The 5th to the 1st&quot;, Hama has denied that &quot;The &#x27;Nam&quot; itself in any way sprang from &quot;The 5th to the 1st&quot;, and mentioned that he did not think Shooter was even aware of those stories.

===Early success===
Golden was planning to work on &quot;Batman&quot; for DC Comics when Hama pitched him the concept for the comic book. Golden had grown tired of drawing superheroes and was looking to do something different: &quot;Being part of that generation, I wanted to do this.&quot; Murray was surprised when Shooter greenlit the series, but felt that he &quot;wanted to try different experiments in different subgenres&quot;. Even then, Murray figured that it might last for 12 issues, but it sold quite well, with the first issue outselling &quot;X-Men&quot; the month it came out. The series had a publicity coup when &quot;The Washington Post&quot; did a big write-up on the first issue&#x27;s release, which was picked up by other newspapers across the country; it was rare that the mainstream press gave significant recognition to doings in the comic book industry.

Murray wanted to work on a Comics Code-approved series in order to reach a broader audience. He said, &quot;I wanted a way to at least tell a part of the story to the kids and maybe get other people to talk about it as well.&quot; However, because of the Code, he was not able to address things like drug use or include swearing. Hama and Murray wanted to ignore politics and focus on the war from the average foot soldier&#x27;s point of view. Murray said that the comic was &quot;a pretty accurate view of the way the average soldier looked at the war. It was outside ordinary experience. The world was elsewhere.&quot;

The actions of the 23rd Infantry were based on fact. In particular, most of the stories in the first 13 issues were based on incidents which had happened to Murray or one of his acquaintances during the war. In addition, every issue featured a back-of-the-book glossary explaining the authentic lingo of the characters.

===Changes in creative team===
Many changes occurred in the series after the first 12 issues; the use of newsprint was abandoned in favor of slicker paper with higher color intensity. The series went direct market-only with &quot;The &#x27;Nam&quot; #18. Artist Michael Golden quit the series, and was replaced by Wayne Vansant. Vansant had in fact been involved with the series from before its launch; Hama, who knew Vansant through his work on &quot;Savage Tales&quot;, told him that though Golden had been chosen as the penciller for &quot;The &#x27;Nam&quot;, he wanted Vansant in reserve as a fill-in artist, since Golden had a tendency to fall behind on his work. Thus, Vansant drew &quot;The &#x27;Nam&quot; #7 as a fill-in and was seen as the natural successor to Golden when he left. Vansant said he was so enthusiastic about working on the series that at one point he was seven months ahead on deadlines.

Hama left the series after a year and a half. He was briefly replaced as editor by his assistant, Pat Redding, who maintained similar policies to Hama. However, when Don Daley took over, he wanted to include superheroes and not continue the series in real time. Murray sharply disagreed with Daley over the direction of &quot;The &#x27;Nam&quot;, in particular the appearance of superheroes in the series. After months of bitter arguments between Murray and Daley, Murray quit, recalling that one of the last straws was when he discovered that Daley had commissioned a &quot;The &#x27;Nam&quot; script from Chuck Dixon in which a pre-Punisher Frank Castle guest-starred. His run ended with &quot;The &#x27;Nam&quot; #45, though he briefly returned to write issues #49–51. Though the Punisher story was written during Murray&#x27;s run, it was not published until a year later, in &quot;The &#x27;Nam&quot; #52–53 (January–February 1991). Had he continued with the book, Murray wanted the main character from the first year, Ed Marks, to come back to Vietnam as a reporter and deal with the subject of Agent Orange.

From 1988 to 1989, Marvel published ten issues of &quot;The &#x27;Nam Magazine&quot;, which reprinted in black-and-white the first twenty issues of the comic on magazine-sized paper.

Immediately following Murray&#x27;s departure, the real time progression of the stories stopped, and the 23rd Infantry squad were dropped as the main characters. Dixon replaced Murray as the regular writer.

===Final months===
Daley re-assigned writing duties for &quot;The &#x27;Nam&quot; to Vietnam veteran Don Lomax, creator of the independent title &quot;Vietnam Journal&quot;, and directed Vansant to begin inking the series as well as penciling it, both starting with &quot;The &#x27;Nam&quot; #70 (July 1992). After the series&#x27; conclusion, an epilogue of sorts was published in the form of a &quot;Punisher&quot; special, &quot;The Punisher in the &#x27;Nam: Final Invasion&quot;, which included the unpublished issues #85 and 86.

The character Michael &quot;Ice&quot; Phillips would go on to reappear in &quot;The Punisher War Journal&quot; #52–53, and &quot;The Punisher War Zone&quot; #27–30.

==Awards==
During its run, &quot;The &#x27;Nam&quot; was nominated for the Best New Series category of the 1987 Jack Kirby Awards.

==Reaction==
Marine Corps veteran and former &quot;Newsweek&quot; editor William Broyles Jr. praised the comic for having &quot;a certain gritty reality&quot;, but Jan Scruggs, President of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, questioned if the Vietnam War should be the subject of a comic book and if it might trivialize it. The comic was praised by the Bravo Organization, a notable Vietnam veterans&#x27; group, as the &quot;best media portrayal of the Vietnam War&quot;, beating out Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Platoon&quot;.

<text>Siebel was a German aircraft manufacturer founded in 1937 in Halle an der Saale.

== History ==
It originated in the Klemm-Flugzeugwerke Halle that had been founded in 1934 as a branch of Leichtflugzeugbau Klemm in Böblingen. Its name changed to Siebel Flugzeugwerke when it was taken over by Friedrich Siebel in December 1937.

After World War II the company was revived as Siebel Flugzeugwerke ATG (SIAT) in West Germany in 1948, with its headquarters in Munich. In 1956, its headquarters were moved to Donauwörth and the company became WMD-Siebelwerke ATG (WMD/SIAT) in 1958 in cooperation with Waggon- und Maschinenbau GmbH Donauwörth (WMD). In 1968 the company was absorbed by Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm after MBB became the major shareholder.

<text>Ndre Mjeda (20 November 18661 August 1937) was an Albanian philologist, poet, priest, rilindas, translator and writer of the Albanian Renaissance. He was a member of the Mjeda family.

He was influenced by the Jesuit writer Anton Xanoni and the Franciscan poet Leonardo De Martino.

== Life ==

From 1880 until 1887, Mjeda studied literature at the Carthusian monastery of Porta Coeli, in Valencia, Spain, rhetoric, Latin and Italian in Croatia at a Jesuit institution, at the Gregorian University in Rome, and at another Gregorian college in Chieri, Italy. During these studies, Mjeda began to write Albanian poetry. Some of his most famous poems include &quot;Vaji i Bylbylit&quot; (&quot;The Nightingale&#x27;s Lament&quot;) (1887) and &quot;Vorri i Skanderbegut&quot; (&quot;Skanderbeg&#x27;s grave&quot;).

Mjeda also taught music in Cremona, Italy, at the College of Marco Girolamo Vida from 1887 to 1891, and translated various religious literature. He published &quot;Jeta e sceitit sc&#x27; Gnon Berchmans&quot; (&quot;The Life of St John Berchmans&quot;) (1888), and &quot;T&#x27; perghjamit e Zojs Bekume&quot; (&quot;Imitation of the Holy Virgin&quot;) (1892), a translation from Spanish, &quot;Katekizmi i Madh&quot; (&quot;The Great Catechism&quot;), another translation, and &quot;Historia e Shejtë&quot; (&quot;Sacred History&quot;).

Mjeda later on studied theology at the Jesuit college in Kraków, Poland, and taught philosophy and philology, as well as served as a librarian at the Gregorian college in Kraljevica, where he was also appointed professor of logic and metaphysics. He was expelled in 1898 after a conflict between Austria-Hungary and the Vatican. In 1899, Mjeda, along with Preng Doçi and Gjergj Fishta founded the &quot;Shoqnia e bashkimit të gjuhës shqipe&quot; (Society for the Unity of the Albanian Language) literary society, usually known as the &quot;Shoqnia Bashkimi&quot; (The Union Society), or simply &quot;Bashkimi&quot; (The Union) of Shkodra for publishing Albanian language books.

In 1901, Mjeda founded the &quot;Agimi&quot; (Dawn) Society in Shkodër. Mjeda devised the Agimi alphabet based on Latin characters following the principle of one letter for a sound and used diacritic marks for other peculiar sounds in the Albanian language. In Hamburg 1902, Mjeda&#x27;s alphabet was approved by the International Congress of the Orientalists and in May by most of the Catholic clergy in Shkodër. Books subsidized by Austria-Hungary were published in the Agimi Alphabet which rivaled the Bashkimi Alphabet for writing Albanian. In 1908, Mjeda was a delegate at the Albanian alphabet Congress of Monastir representing the Agimi Society. Mjeda supported the Latin character Istanbul alphabet as it contained the principle of one letter, one sound and its Latin characters were also similar to the rival Bashkimi alphabet. Toward the late Ottoman period, Mjeda supported Austro-Hungarian intervention in Albanian affairs within the Ottoman Empire.

Mjeda served as a member of the Albanian Literary Commission, in Shkodër, under the Austro-Hungarian administration, as well as a deputy in the National Assembly of Albania. He left politics after Fan Noli&#x27;s defeat, and the rise of King Zog. He then served as a parish priest in Kukël, and taught the Albanian language and literature at the Jesuit college in Shkodër until his death.

<text>The U.S. Steel Tower, also known as the Steel Building, or USX Tower (1988–2001), is a 64-story skyscraper at 600 Grant Street in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The interior has of leasable space. At tall, it is the tallest building in Pittsburgh. It held its opening dedication on September 30, 1971.

The tower&#x27;s original name when completed was the U.S. Steel Tower and was changed to USX Tower in 1988. The name was changed back to the U.S. Steel Tower in January 2002 to reflect U.S. Steel&#x27;s new corporate identity (USX was the 1990s combined oil/energy/steel conglomerate). Although no longer the owner of the building, U.S. Steel remains one of the largest tenants.

==History==
Prior to 1970, the tallest building in Pittsburgh at 44 stories was the Gulf Building (now known as the Gulf Tower). In the planning stages, U.S. Steel executives considered making the building the world&#x27;s tallest, but settled on making it the tallest building outside New York and Chicago. However, it eventually lost even that distinction to newer buildings erected across the United States.

The building contains over 44,000 U.S. tons (40,000 metric tons) of structural steel, and almost an acre of office space per floor. The U.S. Steel Tower is architecturally noted for its triangular shape with indented corners. The building also made history by being the first to use liquid-filled fireproofed columns. U.S. Steel deliberately placed the massive steel columns on the exterior of the building to showcase a new product called Cor-ten steel. Cor-ten resists the corrosive effects of rain, snow, ice, fog, and other meteorological conditions by forming a coating of dark brown oxidation over the metal, which inhibits deeper penetration and doesn&#x27;t need painting and costly rust-prevention maintenance over the years. The initial weathering of the material resulted in a discoloration of the surrounding city sidewalks, as well as other nearby buildings. A cleanup effort was orchestrated by the corporation once weathering was complete to undo this damage, but the sidewalks still have a rusty tinge. The Cor-Ten steel for the building was made at the former U.S. Steel Homestead Works.

Rockwell International, which had its headquarters in the building, displayed a large model of the Rockwell-designed NASA Space Shuttle in the building&#x27;s lobby until the company moved its headquarters to Southern California in 1988.

In May 1986, two men parachuted off the roof of the tower before being arrested by Pittsburgh Police near the Civic Arena.

In 2014, US Steel announced its intention to build new office space at the adjacent site of the former Civic Arena.

The largest occupancy by a tenant of the building is held by UPMC, which leases of office space within the tower. In 2008, UPMC added signage, lights displaying &quot;UPMC,&quot; to the top of the tower for the first time in its history, a move that was criticized by some involved in the construction of the structure.

==Features==
===Water filled columns===

Although accepted for bridges, etc., exposing structural Cor-Ten in a building was not possible using standard construction methods because steel needed to be protected by concrete or an applied insulation to meet the fire-protection requirements of building codes. Fire protection was achieved for the 18 columns of this tower by making them hollow and filled with a water/antifreeze/rust inhibitor mixture, a technique patented in the 19th century. In another building cited in 1970, the horizontal beams were also hollow and interconnected with the columns, the entire system tested to be leakproof.

===LEED Certification===
In 2019, Winthrop Management, with the help of sustainability consulting firm evolveEA, achieved LEED Silver Certification for the US Steel Tower under the Existing Buildings: Operations + Maintenance rating system. The building is one of the largest LEED for O+M: Existing Buildings V4 office buildings in the world. Multiple LEED Certifications have been earned for the interior office spaces inside the tower as well.

===Internal systems===
The U.S. Steel Tower features several redundant systems that have allowed the building to remain free of unplanned service interruptions since it was constructed. It is fed by two redundant water mains, one from Grant Street and one from 7th Avenue. Both are fully maintained and tested annually. There is a fail over system in place, and either main will automatically meet the water demands of the building in the event of a failure. In addition, the building has four redundant water pumps, any one of which can meet the needs of the entire building. The building also has four redundant electrical feeds, which come from several substations.
Finally, the building has fully redundant heating and cooling systems, including two boilers and two water cooled chillers. The heating boilers can burn either natural gas or No. 2 fuel oil. There is no fail over, but manual adjustment of the system in the event of a supply shortage takes only minutes.

===Signage===
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center initially leased five floors of the tower, which now serves as the institution&#x27;s headquarters. Although U.S. Steel was the largest tenant in the building at the time, to go along with this lease, the company also purchased new signs reading &quot;UPMC&quot; for the top of each three sides of the building. The Pittsburgh Planning Commission approved the signs. The signage cost $750,000, according to a document submitted in 2006 to the city planning commission.

Much deliberation surrounded the controversial issue of the sign in planning commission meetings. 
&quot;U&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, and a &quot;C&quot; were installed via helicopter on May 3–4, 2008, but weather conditions postponed completion, and the &quot;M&quot; was not installed until some time later.
The sign was completed June 7–8, 2008. Illumination was provided several weeks after installation. Energy efficient LED lights replaced the neon bulbs used in the original sign in 2019.

=== Plaza and fountain ===
Next to the entrance of the building, there is a plaza and a fountain alongside a brewery named Brew Gentlemen. The area is known as &quot;Steel Garden&quot; There is also a bus stop right outside the plaza that serves the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway.

===Nativity scene===
Each year a nativity scene, goes on display in the building&#x27;s courtyard. It is larger than the original nativity, and is the only authorized replica of the Vatican&#x27;s Christmas crèche in St. Peter&#x27;s Square.

===Roof===
Unlike many buildings of similar heights, the U.S. Steel Tower does not taper in width from its lower floors to its higher floors. Accordingly, the tower sports the &quot;largest roof in the world at its height or above&quot;, at a size of approximately one acre. This flat expanse was once used as a heliport, but it has sat dormant since 1992.

====Top Of The Triangle====
From shortly after the Tower&#x27;s opening until 2001, the 62nd floor was home to Top of the Triangle, a fine dining restaurant that provided unequaled views of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Unable to negotiate new leasing terms, the restaurant closed after 30 years in business and was replaced with more office spaces.

====High Point Park proposal====
An organization known as the High Point Park Investigation was formed to explore the possibility of converting the dormant roof of the U.S. Steel Tower into an attraction of some sort—a &quot;pinnacle of perspective where people go to see the view, a signature landmark like the Eiffel Tower or the Empire State Building&quot;. This transformation could take the form of a nature park, a gallery space, or some other type of attraction. The High Point Park Investigation is based at Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s STUDIO for Creative Inquiry and has received the endorsement of regional organizations including the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy and VisitPittsburgh.com. A 360-degree, gigapixel panorama of the view available from the building&#x27;s rooftop can be seen at www.gigapan.org or www.gigapanorama.org. As of January 2010, the building&#x27;s owner had expressed no interest in developing the roof of the tower, but public interest in the potential of such a project has been high.

In March 2013 a group of architects and designers finished detailed plans for a glass covered 2 floor atrium at the top of the skyscraper, however the building management has not responded thus far to requests for potential construction.

==Sightseeing==
On clear days, it is possible to spot the U.S. Steel Tower from as far as away, from the top of Chestnut Ridge in the Laurel Highlands southeast of the city.

==Fictional portrayals==

The U.S. Steel Tower makes an appearance in the movie &quot;Dogma&quot; and figures prominently in &quot;Sudden Death&quot;, &quot;Boys on the Side&quot;, &quot;Striking Distance&quot;, &quot;Jack Reacher&quot; and the video for the 2010 rap song &quot;Black and Yellow&quot;. It can also be seen in the movie &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, and in the video for the 1986 song &quot;America&quot; by the KBC Band. It is the setting for the Syfy network&#x27;s series of web shorts, &quot;The Mercury Men&quot;. It can also be seen in George A. Romero&#x27;s 1978 horror film, &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;.

The Tower has also been portrayed in multiple video games set in and around Pittsburgh. It can be seen in the &quot;Fallout 3&quot; downloadable mission pack The Pitt. It is also viewable in &quot;The Last of Us&quot; sporting the letters &quot;NA&quot; at the top instead of the usual &quot;UPMC&quot;. Most recently used on daytime soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;.

<doc id="474525" wikidata="Q701499" url="?curid=474525" title="Tang Jingsong">
<text>Tang Jingsong (; 1841–1903) was a Chinese general and statesman. He commanded the Yunnan Army in the Sino-French War (August 1884–April 1885), and made an important contribution to Qing dynasty China&#x27;s military effort in Tonkin (northern Vietnam) by persuading the Black Flag leader Liu Yongfu to serve under Chinese command. His intelligent, though ultimately unsuccessful, direction of the Siege of Tuyên Quang (November 1884–March 1885) was widely praised. He later became governor of the Chinese province of Taiwan. Following China&#x27;s cession of Taiwan to Japan at the end of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) he became president of the short-lived Republic of Formosa.

==The Sino-French War==
Tang Jingsong played an important role in the Sino-French War and during the period of undeclared hostilities that preceded it. In 1882 he was sent by the Qing government to Vietnam to assess the ability of the Vietnamese government to resist French expansion in Tonkin. During his stay he was able to persuade Liu Yongfu to take the field against the French with the Black Flag Army. Liu&#x27;s intervention resulted in the French defeat in the Battle of Paper Bridge on 19 May 1883, in which the French &quot;commandant supérieur&quot; Henri Rivière was killed. In the wake of this disaster, Jules Ferry&#x27;s government committed substantial military and naval forces to Tonkin.

Tang was the only senior Chinese commander to take part in the Sơn Tây Campaign (December 1883). Although Liu Yongfu and his Vietnamese and Chinese allies failed to hold Sơn Tây against the French, Tang&#x27;s loyalty to Liu on that occasion was never forgotten by the Black Flag leader. In September 1884 Tang led the Yunnan Army down the Red River from Lào Cai to threaten the French post of Tuyên Quang, and Liu Yongfu took service with him as a subordinate general.

Although he ultimately failed to capture the French post, Tang&#x27;s intelligent and methodical conduct of the Siege of Tuyên Quang was praised by many of his Chinese colleagues, including Zhang Zhidong, the Viceroy of Liangguang, and Cen Yuying (), the Viceroy of Yun-Gui.

Captain Jean-François-Alphonse Lecomte, one of the more discerning officers of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps, also paid tribute to the skill T&#x27;ang&#x27;s army had shown in its siegecraft at Tuyên Quang:
The mandarins had directed the attack on Tuyen Quang in a very intelligent manner. Owing to the Moslem insurrection in Yunnan, an insurrection that had nearly engulfed the entire province and was only put down by Marshal Ma after several sieges, they were now experts in the art of siegecraft. Their troops were excellent, and although they were unable to capture the fortress, defended as it was by a handful of heroes and relieved in the very nick of time by Giovanninelli&#x27;s brigade, this siege was nonetheless a glorious feat of arms for the Celestials and showed that when necessary they could rise to the occasion.

== The Republic of Formosa ==
Tang succeeded Shao Youlian () as governor of Taiwan in 1894. Upon the outbreak of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–95) he invited his old friend Liu Yongfu to assume command of Qing forces in southern Taiwan.

Following China&#x27;s defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, Taiwan was ceded to Japan in April 1895 under the Treaty of Shimonoseki. A number of Chinese officials in Taiwan decided to resist the Japanese, and proclaimed Taiwan an independent Republic of Formosa. Tang was inaugurated as the republic&#x27;s president on May 25, 1895. The republic lasted no longer than the time it took the Japanese to invade and occupy Taiwan. The Japanese invaded northern Taiwan on May 29, 1895 and defeated Chinese forces at Keelung on 3 June.

When the news of the defeat at Keelung reached Taipei on 4 June, the republican leaders promptly abandoned ship. During the night of 4 June Tang Jingsong fled to Tamsui, and from there sailed for the mainland on the evening of 6 June aboard the steamship &quot;Arthur&quot;. His departure was delayed for a day because of disorder in Tamsui.

After Tang&#x27;s flight, the republican forces continued to resist the Japanese in Taiwan under the leadership of Liu Yongfu. The republican forces were no match for the Japanese, however, and the republic eventually collapsed with the Japanese occupation of Tainan on 21 October 1895. Like Tang, Liu Yongfu also abandoned his soldiers and fled to the mainland to escape capture.

== Death ==
Tang died in 1903 at his home in Guilin, at the age of 63.

<doc id="474527" wikidata="Q246228" url="?curid=474527" title="Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen">
<text>Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen is a 2004 American teen musical comedy film directed by Sara Sugarman from a screenplay by Gail Parent, based on Dyan Sheldon&#x27;s 1999 novel of the same name. It stars Lindsay Lohan as an aspiring teenage actress whose family moves from New York City to New Jersey, Adam Garcia as her favorite rock musician, Glenne Headly as her mother and Alison Pill as her best friend. The film introduced Megan Fox in her theatrical film acting debut.

The film was released on February 20, 2004, by Buena Vista Pictures. It received mostly negative critical reviews and grossed $33 million worldwide.

==Plot==
Mary Elizabeth &quot;Lola&quot; Cep is a 15-year-old girl who grew up in New York City and wants desperately to become a famous Broadway actress. Much to her annoyance, she moves with her family to the suburbs of Dellwood, New Jersey, but she confidently tells the audience, &quot;A legend is about to be born. That legend would be me.&quot;

At school, Lola befriends an unpopular girl, Ella Gerard, who shares her love for the rock band Sidarthur. Lola idolizes the band&#x27;s lead singer, Stu Wolff. She also meets Sam, a cute boy who takes a liking to her, and makes enemies with Carla Santini, the most popular girl in school.

When Lola auditions for the school play, a modernized musical version of &quot;Pygmalion&quot; called &quot;Eliza Rocks&quot;, she is chosen over Carla to play Eliza, and Carla promises to make her life miserable. Lola also beats Carla on a dancing video game at an arcade, whereupon Carla reveals that she has tickets to the farewell concert of Sidarthur, which recently decided to dissolve. Afraid of being one-upped by Carla, Lola falsely claims that she and Ella also have tickets. She loses her chance to buy tickets and new clothes when her mother takes away her allowance, and the concert is sold out by the time she persuades Ella to pay for the tickets. However, Lola explains that they can buy tickets from a scalper, and gets Sam to sneak Eliza&#x27;s dress out of the costume room for her to wear at the concert.

On the night of the concert, Lola and Ella take a train to New York City, but Lola accidentally leaves the money for the tickets on the train, and her plan to sneak into the concert fails. Lola and Ella finally give up and walk through the city to Stu&#x27;s after-show party. When they arrive there, Stu stumbles drunkenly out of the building and passes out in an alley. The two girls take him to a diner to sober him up, but when he hits a cop with a doughnut, the three of them end up at a police station, where Lola gives her father&#x27;s New York City address.

At this point, Lola&#x27;s dishonesty becomes problematic. When she first met Ella, she tried to impress her by telling her a dramatic story about her father dying years earlier. Ella highly values honesty, so she becomes infuriated when she discovers that Lola&#x27;s story was a lie. After Lola&#x27;s father arrives, and they explain what happened, Stu gratefully takes them all back to the party, where Ella forgives Lola for lying (on the condition that she will never lie to her again), and the two girls see Carla, who sees them as well, and looks upset. Lola talks with Stu about his work, but is disappointed to discover that he is an alcoholic.

Back at school, Carla humiliates Lola by denying that she saw Lola or Ella at the party and calling Lola a liar. None of the other students believes Lola&#x27;s story about being arrested with Stu and leaving her necklace at his house.

Afterward, Lola goes home, depressed, and refuses to perform in the play, but encouraged by Ella to return, she arrives backstage just in time to prevent Carla from taking over her part. As she is about to go onstage, her mother wishes her good luck and finally calls her by her nickname, Lola. The modernist interpretation of &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (&quot;Eliza Rocks&quot;) ensues. After a great performance that brings a standing ovation, the cast goes to an after-party at Carla&#x27;s house, where Stu arrives to see Lola. Carla attempts to salvage her pride by saying he is there to see her, but is proved wrong when Stu gives Lola her necklace in front of everyone. As Carla&#x27;s lies become apparent, she backs away from the crowd on the verge of tears and falls into a fountain, greeted by everyone&#x27;s laughter. In a conciliatory gesture, Lola helps her up, and Carla accepts defeat. After dancing with Stu, Lola dances with Sam, and they eventually kiss.

==Production==

===Filming===
Pre-production began on May 5, 2003, beginning with choreography rehearsals and make-up tests. Produced on a budget of $15 million, filming began on June 4. Behind the camera was Welsh director Sara Sugarman, who was known for directing the musical comedy film &quot;Very Annie Mary&quot;. While taking place in New Jersey, the film was filmed in the Canadian cities of Toronto, Hamilton, and Oakville. Scenes at Dellwood High School were filmed at King City Secondary School in King City and Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute in Scarborough. Mall scenes were filmed at Erin Mills Town Centre in Mississauga. Scenes depicting the family&#x27;s move from New York to New Jersey were filmed in Hamilton. It was also filmed on-location for the scenes in New York City. Scenes involving the train station were filmed at the Watchung Avenue Train Station in Montclair, New Jersey, on New Jersey Transit&#x27;s Montclair-Boonton Line.

===Casting===
Originally, the role of Lola was offered to Hilary Duff. After Duff backed out of the film, Lindsay Lohan was cast as Lola. &quot;The part that stuck out to me most about the story was how different Lola is&quot;, Lohan said. &quot;She&#x27;s really interesting. As outgoing as she is, she keeps a lot in and I think it&#x27;s really good to see how her character develops throughout the story.&quot; Producer Robert Shapiro said, &quot;Lindsay Lohan is absolutely a 500-watt bulb. She&#x27;s delightful to watch, she&#x27;s a typical teenager, and she&#x27;s very wise, and all of that comes across in the part of Lola.&quot;

Alison Pill, who was known for co-starring in the Judy Garland biopic &quot;Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows&quot;, was cast as Lola&#x27;s best friend, Ella Gerard. &quot;I think the attraction to play Ella is she changes so completely and goes through this huge transformation from being this girl who&#x27;s terrified of being herself, and disappointing her parents, and disappointing their expectations, and at the end she says, &#x27;I&#x27;ve just decided to be who I am. An unknown at the time, Megan Fox was cast as Carla Santini, Lola&#x27;s nemesis (Brittany Gray played Fox&#x27;s dance double). Eli Marienthal was cast as Sam, Lola&#x27;s interest in high school and her friend. Marienthal had previously starred in Disney film &quot;The Country Bears&quot;. Glenne Headly was cast as Lola&#x27;s mother, Karen, while Carol Kane was cast as Miss Baggoli, who directs the school&#x27;s play. Tom McCamus appears as Lola&#x27;s father, Calum, who is divorced from her mother and lives in New York City.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen&quot; grossed $29.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $3.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $33.2 million. The film grossed $9.3 million in its opening weekend (February 20–22, 2004), finishing at number two behind &quot;50 First Dates&quot;.

===Critical response===
 Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Dennis Harvey of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine commented in his review that &quot;Based on Dyan Sheldon&#x27;s popular youth fiction, &quot;Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen&quot; emerges a strained showcase for up-and-comer Lindsay Lohan as a sophisticated Big Apple teen unhappily relocated to New Jersey. Minimally funny comedy feels like a Disney Channel pic that got boosted to theatrical after Lohan scored a hit opposite Jamie Lee Curtis in the &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; remake. Nonetheless, it should have a lock on the 7- to 12-year-old female demo for a couple of weekends before finding longer tube/tape shelf life.&quot; UltimateDisney.com reviewed the DVD, saying that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t garner a recommendation as a film, and its DVD special features are as breezy and shallow as the movie itself. Lindsay Lohan fans and teenage girls are bound to be the most interested, and they might well enjoy it on the surface as light entertainment. But for others, one viewing may be more than enough.&quot;

====Retrospective====
In 2024, Clare Martin of &quot;Paste Magazine&quot; reexamined the movie for its 20th anniversary and stated it &quot;may have the best portrayal of an adolescent girl&#x27;s inner life—not the serious, lonely moments, but the vibrant fantasies that fuel crushes and obsessions of the moment&quot; as the character of Lola &quot;may be chided as a drama queen during the film, but her intense emotions reflect the reality of teenage interiority&quot; and her &quot;unabashed enthusiasm and, at times, ridiculousness are so contrary to our lives that it&#x27;s no wonder that [the movie] was slated by movie critics (a profession historically dominated by men).&quot; Calling it a &quot;heightened predecessor&quot; to the 2017 film &quot;Lady Bird&quot; and drawing comparisons to the lead character of the novel &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;, Lohan&#x27;s performance is also praised for making &quot;a character that could be grating in the wrong hands extremely fun to watch.&quot; Rebecca Schriesheim of &quot;Collider&quot; dubbed it &quot;one of the most underrated teen movies of the 2000s&quot; and considered that it&#x27;s overshadowed by Lohan&#x27;s film &quot;Mean Girls&quot; from the same year. Lohan&#x27;s and Fox&#x27;s performances are applauded, with the former delivering &quot;the captivating larger-than-life persona that skyrocketed her to fame,&quot; as well as the themes addressed in the story: &quot;the comedy musical is made by women, for women. It&#x27;s also an over-the-top satire examining how pop culture and the media portray teenage girls. The film claps back by embracing the drama with strong female leads, and rejoices in their theatrics.&quot;

===Legacy===
A satirical poster of &quot;Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen&quot; is featured in the 2023 surrealist film &quot;Beau is Afraid&quot;, directed by Ari Aster. 54 Below paid homage to the film with a 20th anniversary concert at the Broadway theater Studio 54 on February 20, 2024. It received a midnight screening at Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles on November 16, 2024.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack was released February 17, 2004, by Hollywood Records and features Lindsay Lohan, Lillix, Simple Plan, and various other artists.

==Awards==
* 2004 - Won; Teen Choice Award for Choice Breakout Movie Actress (Lindsay Lohan)

<text>Ernest Alexander Burke (June 26, 1924 – January 31, 2004) was an American baseball player in the Negro leagues.

Burke was born in Havre de Grace, Maryland. During World War II, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, and was one of the first black U.S. Marines to serve in World War II, earning a medal as a sharpshooter. During his tour of duty in the Pacific, Burke began to play baseball.

After the war, he became a pitcher and outfielder for the Baltimore Elite Giants in the Negro American League. He played for Baltimore from 1946 to 1949. In 1949, he joined the Pough-Kingston team in the Western League, then later played in the Canadian Provincial League.

Burke died of kidney cancer complications at the age of 79. A statue of Burke was unveiled on June 26, 2021, in his home city.

<doc id="474541" wikidata="Q2477538" url="?curid=474541" title="36th (Ulster) Division">
<text>The 36th (Ulster) Division was an infantry division of the British Army, part of Lord Kitchener&#x27;s New Army, formed in September 1914. Originally called the &quot;Ulster Division&quot;, it was made up of mainly members of the Ulster Volunteers, who formed thirteen additional battalions for three existing regiments: the Royal Irish Fusiliers, the Royal Irish Rifles and the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers. The division served from October 1915 on the Western Front as a formation of the British Army during the Great War.

The division&#x27;s insignia was the Red Hand of Ulster.

==History==
===Formation===

The Ulster Volunteers were a unionist militia founded in 1912 to block Home Rule for Ireland. In 1913 they organised themselves into the Ulster Volunteer Force to give armed resistance to the prospective Third Home Rule Act (enacted in 1914). Many Ulster Protestants feared being governed by a Catholic-dominated parliament in Dublin and losing their local supremacy and strong links with Britain. At the outbreak of the Great War, Sir Edward Carson, one of the unionist leaders, made an appeal to Ulster Volunteers to come forward for military service. Kitchener had hoped for a brigade&#x27;s worth of men, but instead received a division, equivalent to three brigades. Major-General Oliver Nugent took command of the division in September 1915 and it moved to France in October 1915.

===Engagements===
====The Somme, 1916====
The Ulster Division was one of the few divisions to make significant gains on the first day on the Somme. It attacked between the Ancre and Thiepval against a position known as the Schwaben Redoubt. According to military historian Martin Middlebrook:

During the Battle of the Somme the Ulster Division was the only division of X Corps to have achieved its objectives on the opening day of the battle. This came at a heavy price, with the division suffering in two days of fighting 5,500 officers and enlisted men killed, wounded or missing. War correspondent Philip Gibbs said of the Division, &quot;Their attack was one of the finest displays of human courage in the world.

Of nine Victoria Crosses given to British forces in the battle, four were awarded to Ulster Division soldiers.

=====Actions of the 36th Division=====

Thiepval – Somme

The Ulster Division&#x27;s sector of the Somme lay astride the marshy valley of the River Ancre and the higher ground south of the river. Their task was to cross the ridge and take the German second line near Grandcourt. In their path lay not only the German front line, but just beyond it, the intermediate line within which was the Schwaben Redoubt.

The first day of the Somme was the anniversary (in the Julian calendar) of the Battle of the Boyne, a fact remarked on by the leaders of the division. Stories have often been told that some men wore orange sashes into battle. According to David Hume: &quot;There was many who went over the top at the Somme who were Ulstermen, at least one, Sergeant Samuel Kelly of 9th Inniskillings wearing his Ulster Sash, while others wore orange ribbons&quot;. Martin Middlebrook recounts a story that when some of his men wavered, one company commander from the West Belfasts, Major George Gaffikin, took off his orange sash, held it high for his men to see, and roared the traditional war-cry of the Battle of the Boyne: &quot;Come on, boys! No surrender!&quot; However, historians Robin Prior and Trevor Wilson, quoting Northern Irish historian Keith Jeffery, state that such stories are myths.

On 1 July, following the preliminary bombardment, the Ulstermen quickly took the German front line, but intelligence was so poor that, with the rest of the division attacking under creep bombardment (artillery fired in front or over men; they advance as it moves) the Ulstermen would have come under attack from their own bombardment in the German first line.

But they still advanced, moving to the crest so rapidly that the Germans had no time to come up from their dugouts (generally 30–40 feet below ground). In the Schwaben Redoubt, which was also taken, so successful was the advance that by 10:00 some had reached the German second line. But again they came under their own barrage, not due to finish until 10:10. However, this successful penetration had to be given up before nightfall, as it was unmatched by those at its flanks. The Ulstermen were exposed in a narrow salient, open to attack on three sides. They were running out of ammunition and supplies, and a full German counter-attack at 22:00 forced them to withdraw, giving up virtually all they gained.

The division had suffered over 5,000 casualties and 2,069 deaths. The Thiepval Memorial commemorates the 1916 Anglo-French offensive on the Somme and the men who died there, including those from the Ulster Division. It is the biggest British war memorial to the missing of the Western Front, both in physical size and in terms of the numbers it commemorates (more than 73,000). It was built in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

=====Ulster Memorial Tower=====

The Ulster Memorial Tower was unveiled by Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson in Thiepval, France, on 19 November 1921, in commemoration of the contributions of the 36th (Ulster) Division during World War I. The tower marks the site of the Schwaben Redoubt, against which the Ulster Division advanced on the first day of the Somme.

Lord Carson had intended to perform the unveiling himself but, due to illness, Field-Marshal Wilson took his place. The money was raised by public subscription in Northern Ireland in memory of the officers and men of the Ulster Division, and all Ulstermen who died in the great war.

The tower itself is a replica of Helen&#x27;s Tower at Clandeboye, County Down. It was at Helen&#x27;s Tower that the men of the then newly formed Ulster Division drilled and trained on the outbreak of World War I. For many of the men of the division, the distinctive sight of Helen&#x27;s Tower rising above the surrounding countryside was one of their last abiding memories of home before their departure for England and, subsequently, the Western Front.

====Messines, 1917====

The Ulster Division was deeply involved in the fighting around Spanbroekmolen on the first day of the Battle of Messines (7–14 June 1917). Many of its men are buried in Spanbroekmolen British Cemetery and Lone Tree Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery on Messines Ridge.

<doc id="474544" wikidata="Q1271013" url="?curid=474544" title="Adrianus">
<text>Adrianus of Tyre (Ancient Greek: , c. 113 – 193 AD), also written as Hadrian and Hadrianos, was a sophist of ancient Athens who flourished under the emperors Marcus Aurelius and Commodus. Adrianus was the pupil of Herodes Atticus, and obtained the chair of philosophy at Athens during the lifetime of his master, which does not seem to have impaired their mutual regard; Herodes declared that the unfinished speeches of his scholar were &quot;the fragments of a colossus,&quot; and Adrianus showed his gratitude by a funeral oration which he pronounced over the ashes of his master. 

Philostratus recounts a story of Adrianus&#x27; trial and acquittal for the murder of a begging sophist who had insulted him: Adrianus had retorted by styling such insults , but his pupils were not content with weapons of ridicule. Marcus Aurelius met Adrianus on a visit to Athens, invited him to Rome, and honored with his friendship: the emperor even condescended to set the thesis of a declamation for him. After the death of Aurelius he became the private secretary of Commodus. His died at Rome at the age of 80, not later than 192 AD, if Philostratus&#x27; account is true that Commodus (who was assassinated at the end of that year) sent him a letter on his death-bed.

The &quot;Suda&quot; lists Adrianus&#x27; works as &quot;Declamations&quot;, &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (7 books), &quot;On Types of Style&quot; (5 books), &quot;On Distinctive Features in the Issues&quot; (3 books), letters, epideictic speeches, &quot;Phalaris&quot;, and &quot;Consolation to Celer&quot;. Of these works only three declamations are extant.

<doc id="474547" wikidata="Q371564" url="?curid=474547" title="Pleistoanax">
<text>Pleistoanax, also spelled Plistoanax, () was Agiad king of Sparta from 458 to 409 BC. He was the leader of the peace party in Sparta at a time of violent confrontations against Athens for the hegemony over Greece.

The son of Pausanias, Pleistoanax was still a minor in 458 BC, so his uncle Nicomedes acted as regent. His first recorded action was the invasion of Athens in 446 BC as part of the First Peloponnesian War (460–445 BC), but he chose instead to negotiate with Pericles a settlement that became the Thirty Years&#x27; Peace. However, Pleistoanax was sued in Sparta for his failure to take Athens and went into exile in Arcadia to avoid punishment. He lived on the sacred ground of Zeus in Mt. Lykaion for the next 18 years.

The death of the rival king Archidamus II in 427 enabled his return to Sparta, while the city was again at war against Athens in the Second Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC). Pleistoanax renewed his efforts to make peace with Athens, which was finally concluded in 421 (as the Peace of Nicias).

== Family background ==
Pleistoanax was the son of Pausanias, regent in the beginning of the reign of his nephew Pleistarchus (r. 480–459) until his murder by the ephors, possibly in 467/6, allegedly for Medism. He belonged to the Agiad dynasty, one of the two royal families in Sparta (the other being the Eurypontids). He was born in the second half of the 470s; two younger brothers rapidly followed: Cleomenes and Aristocles.

Pleistoanax succeeded his cousin Pleistarchus, who died childless in 459. As he was still a minor, his uncle Nicomedes (Pausanias&#x27; younger brother) became his regent.

== Reigns ==
=== First reign (459–445 BC) ===
At the time of Pleistoanax&#x27;s accession, Greece was torn by the First Peloponnesian War (460–445 BC), a series of minor conflicts between Sparta and Athens and their respective allies. In 457 Pleistoanax&#x27;s uncle and regent Nicomedes commanded a large army of 1500 Spartans and 10,000 allies to help Doris to repel an attack from Phokis. The army was considerably larger than needed to defeat Phokis, so its real goal was likely to invade Attica from the west. The other king, Archidamus II, did not command the expedition, either because he was still busy with the revolt of the Helots, or perhaps he disapproved it. Nicomedes drew the Athenians into battle by reaching Tanagra, close to their border. The subsequent battle was nevertheless a Pyrrhic victory for Sparta, which had to retreat to the Peloponnese by breaking through Megara on the Isthmus.

Pleistoanax&#x27;s first campaign took place in the Summer of 446, at the expiration of a five year peace with Athens. As he was still young (in his 20&#x27;s), Pleistoanax was given a group of advisers—the only named being Cleandridas (father of the famous Gylippus), probably ephor that year. Sparta exploited the revolts of Megara and the island of Euboia against Athens, which had forced Pericles to lead an army to the island. Pericles swiftly returned to the mainland when he heard that Pleistoanax had passed through the Isthmus and Megara to Athens, and was ravaging the area around Eleusis in Attica. While a battle looked inevitable, Pleistoanax and Pericles actually negotiated a settlement. Pericles abandoned all Athenian claims on the Greek mainland (apart from its own civic territory) and withdrew the garrisons from Megara, Troezen, and Achaia; the Spartan army then returned home.

However, upon his return, Pleistoanax and Cleandridas were accused by several Spartans of bribery for having spared Athens while they had the upper hand. Plutarch tells that Pericles listed the sum of ten talents (about 260kg of silver) in his accounts for his year of office, which would therefore be the money used to buy the Spartans. Although it is not impossible that Pleistoanax accepted the money, it is certainly not the only reason for his withdrawal. Perhaps he simply thought that Pericles&#x27; offer was enough for a campaign without any fighting. A solar eclipse took place on 2 September 446 and could have been interpreted as a bad omen to continue the war. In 480, Pleistoanax&#x27;s grandfather, the regent Cleombrotus, had cancelled a campaign for the same reason. Another possibility is that Pleistoanax could have feared that if Athens became too weak, it would not have been unable to counter a new offensive of Persia into Greece. Pleistoanax was prosecuted immediately after his arrival to Sparta. A majority of the ephors and probably the other king Archidamus II voted against him. Although some modern scholars consider that Pleistoanax could have been sentenced to death, most think he was only fined 15 talents; the king nevertheless refused to pay and went into exile. Cleandridas received a death sentence, but fled to Thourioi in Italy, where he received the citizenship.

The terms of the peace negotiated between Pleistoanax and Pericles were ironically retained in the Thirty Years&#x27; Peace signed soon after.

=== Exile (445–427 BC) ===

In order to escape punishment, Pleistoanax tried a different strategy from that used by his father, who, although a suppliant in the Bronze House of Athena in Sparta, was starved to death by the ephors in this temple. The king left Laconia to Mount Lykaion in the territory of Parrhasia, a small city in Arcadia, where he built a house on the sacred ground of Zeus Lycaeus. Under this epithet, Zeus was worshipped as a god of light, so it seems that Pleistoanax aimed at finding a divine support of his deeds by living on the sacred ground of the god behind the eclipse of 446. The sacred ground provided him an additional protection against death from his fellow Spartans, either as a result of a death sentence, or an extrajudicial murder. 

Pleistoanax&#x27;s son Pausanias was born at about the same time as his father&#x27;s departure into exile, perhaps even after. The choice to name his son after his father shows the defiance of Pleistoanax against the Spartan authorities, as Pausanias the Regent had been convicted of treason. The other king Archidamus II was certainly the main opponent of Pleistoanax and his supporters. He could &quot;de facto&quot; reign alone, because the infant Pausanias was in no position to contest Archidamus. For this reason, Archidamus constantly opposed Pleistoanax&#x27;s recall from exile, despite multiple requests from the Delphic oracle.

Pleistoanax finally returned to Sparta in 427. Thucydides says that his younger brother Aristokles bribed the Pythia in order to convince the pious Spartans to recall him from exile. His return was more likely the result of Archidamus&#x27; death that year. There was also a genuine concern from Delphi to solve the rift between the two royal families as it weakened Sparta (Delphi&#x27;s ally). Moreover, the Pythia knew that Pleistoanax would make peace between Athens and Sparta possible, which was desirable for Delphi, as the war hurt its finances by the lack of pilgrims and donations. Nevertheless, the corruption rumour stuck and Pleistoanax was still suspected of having bribed the Pythia in 421. Thucydides&#x27; source on this story may have been Agis II, son of Archidamus, which would explain the favourable picture of Archidamus in his &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot;.

A ceremony was organised in Sparta to celebrate the king&#x27;s return, which—according to Thucydides—used the same ancient sacrifices and songs as during the foundation of Sparta. The purpose of this ceremony was to reassert the authority of Pleistoanax over his son Pausanias, who had nominally reigned since 445. Its disposition were perhaps given by Delphi in another oracle.

=== Second reign (427–409 BC) ===
When Pleistoanax returned to Sparta, the city had been at war against Athens since 431 in the Peloponnesian War, which he had tried to prevent in 446. The Spartan strategy was to launch yearly invasion of Attica; that of 426 was led by Agis II, the other king and son of Archidamus, although he had just ascended the throne. It seems that Pleistoanax was passed over because he was not considered reliable to conduct the operations against Athens. However, Agis soon cancelled the attack because of several earthquakes, interpreted as bad omens. Julius Beloch thought that the earthquake was just a pretext, showing that, with the return of Pleistoanax, the Peace Party was now in power in Sparta. Pleistoanax was also responsible for the abrupt change of Sparta&#x27;s attitude regarding Athens. After the defeat of Sphacteria in 425, Sparta sought peace with Athens and even proposed an alliance, but to no avail. 

Pleistoanax is again found working for peace in 421. Thucydides explains his peaceful efforts by a selfish motivation: he wanted to end the war in order to stop the blame he received from some Spartans for any setback suffered by Sparta (as a result of his sacrilegious bribery of the Pythia). Pleistoanax more likely thought that making peace better served the interests of Sparta. This time, negotiations were successful and the Peace of Nicias was signed. The Athenian Nicias gave its name to the treaty, but it could have also been named the peace of Pleistoanax due to his role in the settlement.

Several Spartan allies were dissatisfied by the Treaty, and Mantinea even left the Peloponnesian League in 421, which prompted a war with Sparta. Pleistoanax was chosen to lead an operation in Parrhasia, where Mantinea had built a fort in a strategic point (the later site of Megalopolis). By freeding the Parrhasians from the domination of Mantinea, Pleistoanax likely helped some allies he had made during his exile on nearby Mt. Lykaion.

He was succeeded by his son Pausanias.

<text>Le Divorce is a 2003 romantic comedy-drama film directed by James Ivory from a screenplay by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala and Ivory, based on the 1997 novel of the same name by Diane Johnson.

==Plot==
Isabel Walker travels to Paris to visit her sister Roxy, a poet who lives with her husband, Frenchman Charles-Henri de Persand, and their young daughter, Gennie. Roxy is pregnant, but her husband has just walked out on her without explanation. Isabel discovers that he has a mistress, a Russian woman named Magda Tellman, whom he intends to marry after securing a divorce from Roxy. Roxy refuses to divorce him.

Roxy is also in possession of a painting of Saint Ursula by Georges de La Tour; the painting belongs to the Walker family, but due to her marriage to Charles-Henri and French community property laws, the ownership is disputed between the two families. The Louvre deems the painting worthless and concludes that it is not a real La Tour. However, the J. Paul Getty Museum takes an interest in the painting and its curator believes that the painting was done by La Tour himself.

Paris-based American author Olivia Pace, a friend of Roxy&#x27;s, offers Isabel a job. Isabel also meets Yves, Olivia&#x27;s protégé, and they begin dating. The sisters visit Charles-Henri&#x27;s family&#x27;s country home for Sunday brunch, where Isabel meets Charles-Henri&#x27;s mother Suzanne and her handsome middle-aged brother, Edgar Cosset. Isabel is attracted to the older, wealthy and married Edgar and they begin an affair, although Isabel continues to string Yves along. Edgar begins to send Isabel various gifts, including an expensive red Kelly bag by Hermès, which Isabel carries with her at all times. During a visit to Isabel, Suzanne discovers the Kelly bag, after which she realizes that Edgar is having an affair with Isabel.

Charles-Henri maintains a blasé attitude about his infidelity and insists on a divorce. He also hopes to benefit from the French community property laws in the divorce, especially with regard to the La Tour painting. His mistress Magda is married to a man named Tellman, who begins to stalk and harass Isabel and Roxy, believing the latter to be responsible for his wife&#x27;s desertion. Charles-Henri&#x27;s cruelty and insensitivity take their toll on Roxy, and she attempts suicide in late pregnancy. She survives and is supported by Isabel and her lawyer Bertram.

Roxy and Isabel&#x27;s family arrive from the United States to support the sisters, and to also discuss the divorce proceedings and the ownership of the La Tour painting. Things are further complicated when Edgar&#x27;s wife, Amélie, discovers the affair through Suzanne. Following a brunch with both families, Suzanne and Amélie privately inform Isabel&#x27;s mother about the affair; she later confronts Isabel with this information.

During an outing, Magda and Charles-Henri tease Tellman with their new relationship. Later, they are both murdered by Tellman in a crime of passion, with Charles-Henri&#x27;s body being found in Roxy&#x27;s apartment complex. Roxy and Bertram come upon the scene and the stress causes her to go into labor. Tellman then follows Isabel and her family on an outing to the Eiffel Tower, where he corners them and pulls a gun, demanding an opportunity to explain to Roxy why he killed her husband. After some persuasion, the distraught Tellman releases the gun to Isabel, who puts it into the Kelly bag and throws it off the Eiffel Tower.

Edgar, persuaded by his socially-conscious family&#x27;s concern, and tiring of his young lover, casually ends his affair with Isabel over lunch, with the gift of a Hermes scarf. Afterwards, Isabel begins a real relationship with Yves. After Roxy&#x27;s baby is born, she marries Bertram. The family attends an art auction where the La Tour painting sells to The Getty for 4.5 million Euros. Because its ownership is no longer disputed due to Charles-Henri&#x27;s death, the money goes to the Walker family, who then go on to establish the &quot;Fondation Sainte Ursule&quot; (The Saint Ursula Foundation).

===Critical response===

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three out of four stars and felt that it did not &quot;work on its intended level, because we don&#x27;t care enough about the interactions of the enormous cast. But it works in another way, as a sophisticated and knowledgeable portrait of values in collision&quot;. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, A.O. Scott wrote: &quot;As it is, &quot;Le Divorce&quot; is tasteful, but almost entirely without flavor. It is tough work to sit through a comedy made by filmmakers with so little sense of timing and no evident sense of humor&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;C&quot; rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote: &quot;I&#x27;m disappointed to report that Hudson and Watts have no chemistry as sisters, perhaps because Watts never seems like the expatriate artiste she&#x27;s supposed to be playing&quot;. In his review for the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, David Ng wrote: &quot;Indeed, featuring a boatload of intercontinental stars who have little to do, &quot;Le Divorce&quot; uncannily embodies its privileged bilingual milieu. At worst, it suggests a documentary of its own lavish wrap party&quot;. &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine&#x27;s Glenn Kenny gave the film three out of four stars and wrote that &quot;the picture is a nice return to form for Ivory and company, as well as a welcome stretch for Kate Hudson, whose luminous talents, I fear, are going to be hidden under bushels of stupid Hollywood romantic comedies for the foreseeable future&quot;. In his review for &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, Andrew Sarris wrote: &quot;The film&#x27;s greatest achievement, however, is in keeping a dizzying variety of characters at odds with each other without any breach of good manners, and without descending to facile stereotypes and caricatures&quot;.

<text>Sir Simon Michael Schama ( ; born 13 February 1945) is a British historian and television presenter. He specialises in art history, Dutch history, Jewish history, and French history. He is a Professor of History and Art History at Columbia University.

Schama first came to public attention with his history of the French Revolution titled &quot;&quot;, published in 1989. He is also known for writing and hosting the 15-part BBC television documentary series &quot;A History of Britain&quot; (2000—2002), as well as other documentary series such as &quot;The American Future: A History&quot; (2008) and &quot;The Story of the Jews&quot; (2013).

Schama was knighted in the 2018 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List.

==Early life and education==
Schama was born on 13 February 1945 in Marylebone, London. His mother, Gertie (née Steinberg), was from an Ashkenazi Lithuanian Jewish family (from Kaunas, present-day Lithuania), and his father, Arthur Schama, was of Sephardi Jewish background (from Smyrna, present-day İzmir in Turkey), later moving through Moldova and Romania.

In the mid-1940s, the family moved to Southend-on-Sea in Essex before moving back to London. In 1956, Schama won a scholarship to the private Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Boys&#x27; School in Cricklewood (from 1961 Elstree, Hertfordshire). He then studied history at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he was taught by John H. Plumb. He graduated from the University of Cambridge with a Starred First in 1966.

==Career==
From 1966 to 1976, Schama was a fellow and director of studies in history at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He then moved to Oxford University, where he was elected a fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford in 1976, specialising in the French Revolution. He also worked at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS) in Paris.

At this time, Schama wrote his first book, &quot;Patriots and Liberators&quot;, which won the Wolfson History Prize. The book was originally intended as a study of the French Revolution, but as published in 1977, it focused on the effect of the &quot;Patriottentijd&quot; revolution of the 1780s in the Netherlands, and its aftermath.

His second book, &quot;Two Rothschilds and the Land of Israel&quot; (1978), is a study of the Zionist aims of Edmond and James Rothschild.

===In the United States===
In 1980, Schama took up a chair at Harvard University as Mellon Professor of History. His next book, &quot;The Embarrassment of Riches&quot; (1987), again focused on Dutch history. Schama interpreted the ambivalences that informed the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century, held in balance between the conflicting imperatives, to live richly and with power, or to live a godly life. The iconographic evidence that Schama draws upon, in 317 illustrations, of emblems and propaganda that defined Dutch character, prefigured his expansion in the 1990s as a commentator on art and visual culture.
&quot;Citizens&quot; (1989), written at speed to a publisher&#x27;s commission, saw the publication of his long-awaited study of the French Revolution, and won the 1990 NCR Book Award. Its view that the violence of the Terror was inherent from the start of the Revolution, however, has received serious negative criticism.

Schama appeared as an on-screen expert in Michael Wood&#x27;s 1989 PBS series &quot;Art of the Western World&quot; (&quot;Realms of Light: The Baroque&quot;) as a presenting art historian, commenting on paintings by Diego Velázquez, Rembrandt, and Johannes Vermeer.

In 1991, he published &quot;Dead Certainties (Unwarranted Speculations)&quot;, a relatively slender work of unusual structure and point-of-view in that it looked at two widely reported deaths a hundred years apart, that of British Army General James Wolfe in 1759 – and the famous 1770 painting depicting the event by Benjamin West – and that of George Parkman, murdered uncle of the better known 19th-century American historian Francis Parkman.

Schama mooted some possible (invented) connections between the two cases, exploring the historian&#x27;s inability &quot;ever to reconstruct a dead world in its completeness however thorough or revealing the documentation&quot;, and speculatively bridging &quot;the teasing gap separating a lived event and its subsequent narration.&quot; Not all readers absorbed the nuance of the title: it received a very mixed critical and academic reception. Traditional historians in particular denounced Schama&#x27;s integration of fact and conjecture to produce a seamless narrative, but later assessments took a more relaxed view of the experiment.

It was an approach soon taken up by such historical writers as Peter Ackroyd, David Taylor, and Richard Holmes.

Schama&#x27;s next book, &quot;Landscape and Memory&quot; (1995), focused on the relationship between physical environment and folk memory, separating the components of landscape as wood, water and rock, enmeshed in the cultural consciousness of collective &quot;memory&quot; embodied in myths, which Schama finds to be expressed outwardly in ceremony and text. More personal and idiosyncratic than &quot;Dead Certainties&quot;, this book was more traditionally structured and better-defined in its approach. Despite mixed reviews, the book was a commercial success and won numerous prizes.

Plaudits came from the art world rather than from traditional academia. Schama became art critic for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1995. He held the position for three years, dovetailing his regular column with professorial duties at Columbia University; a selection of his essays on art for the magazine, chosen by Schama himself, was published in 2005 under the title &quot;Hang Ups&quot;. During this time, Schama also produced a lavishly illustrated &quot;Rembrandt&#x27;s Eyes&quot;, another critical and commercial success. Despite the book&#x27;s title, it contrasts the biographies of Rembrandt van Rijn and Peter Paul Rubens.

===BBC===
Schama returned to the UK in 2000, having been commissioned by the BBC to produce a series of television documentary programmes on British history as part of their Millennium celebrations, under the title &quot;A History of Britain&quot;. Schama wrote and presented the episodes himself, in a friendly and often jocular style with his highly characteristic delivery, and was rewarded with excellent reviews and unexpectedly high ratings. There has been, however, some irritation and criticism expressed by a group of historians about Schama&#x27;s condensed recounting of the British Isles&#x27; history on this occasion, particularly by those specialising in the pre-Anglo-Saxon history of Insular Celtic civilisation. Three series were made, totalling 15 episodes, covering the complete span of British history up until 1965; it went on to become one of the BBC&#x27;s best-selling documentary series on DVD. Schama also wrote a trilogy of tie-in books for the show, which took the story up to the year 2000; there is some debate as to whether the books are the tie-in product for the TV series, or the other way around. The series also had some popularity in the United States when it was first shown on the History Channel.
In 2001, Schama received a CBE. In 2003, he signed a new contract with the BBC and HarperCollins to produce three new books and two accompanying TV series. Worth £3 million (around US$5.3m), it represents the biggest advance deal ever for a TV historian. The first result of the deal was a book and TV show entitled &quot;Rough Crossings: Britain, the Slaves and the American Revolution&quot;, dealing in particular with the proclamation issued during the Revolutionary War by Lord Dunmore offering slaves from rebel plantations freedom in return for service to the crown.

In 2006, the BBC broadcast a new TV series, &quot;Simon Schama&#x27;s Power of Art&quot;, which, with an accompanying book, was presented and written by Schama. It marks a return to art history for him, treating eight artists through eight key works: Caravaggio&#x27;s &quot;David with the Head of Goliath&quot;, Bernini&#x27;s &quot;Ecstasy of St Theresa&quot;, Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis&quot;, Jacques-Louis David&#x27;s &quot;The Death of Marat&quot;, J. M. W. Turner&#x27;s &quot;The Slave Ship&quot;, Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s &quot;Wheat Field with Crows&quot;, Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot; and Mark Rothko&#x27;s Seagram murals. It was also shown on PBS in the United States.

In October 2008, on the eve of the presidential election won by Barack Obama, the BBC broadcast a four-part television series called &quot;The American Future: A History&quot; presented and written by Schama. In March 2009, Schama presented a BBC Radio 4 show entitled &quot;Baseball and Me&quot;, both exploring the history of the game and describing his own personal support of the Boston Red Sox.

In 2010, Schama presented a series of ten talks for the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;A Point of View.&quot;
In 2011, the BBC commissioned Simon Schama to write and present a five-part series called &quot;A History of the Jews&quot; for BBC Two, for transmission in 2012, The title became &quot;The Story of the Jews&quot; and broadcast was delayed until September 2013. Writing in &quot;The Observer&quot;, Andrew Anthony called the series &quot;an astonishing achievement, a TV landmark.&quot;

In 2018, Simon Schama wrote and presented five of the nine episodes of &quot;Civilisations&quot;, a reboot of the 1969 series by Kenneth Clark.

==Personal life==
Schama is Jewish. He is married to Virginia Papaioannou, a geneticist from California; they have two children, Chloe and Gabriel. As of 2014, Schama resides in Briarcliff Manor, New York. He is a Tottenham Hotspur supporter.

===Politics===
In 2010, Schama was a financial donor to Oona King&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign to become Mayor of London.

In August 2014, Schama was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

In November 2017, Schama joined Simon Sebag Montefiore and Howard Jacobson in writing a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; about their concern over antisemitism in the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership, with particular reference to a growth in Anti-Zionism and its purported &quot;antisemitic characteristics&quot;. Schama and Sebag Montefiore have both written historical works about Israel, while Jacobson has written regularly about Israel and the UK Jewish community in his newspaper columns. Schama made a further criticism of the party in July 2019, when he joined other leading Jewish figures in saying, in a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, that the crisis was &quot;a taint of international and historic shame&quot; and that trust in the party was &quot;fractured beyond repair&quot;.

====Israel====
Schama was critical of British art critic John Berger&#x27;s support for the Palestinian call for an academic boycott of Israel. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in a 2006 article co-authored with Anthony Julius, Schama compared the open letter written by Berger and signed by 92 other leading artists to Nazi Germany, saying: &quot;This is not the first boycott call directed at Jews. On 1 April 1933, only weeks after he came to power, Hitler ordered a boycott of Jewish shops, banks, offices and department stores.&quot; 

In 2006 on the BBC, Schama debated with Vivienne Westwood the morality of Israel&#x27;s actions in the Israel-Lebanon War. He described Israel&#x27;s bombing of Lebanese city centres as unhelpful to Israel&#x27;s attempt to &quot;get rid of&quot; Hezbollah. He said: &quot;Of course the spectacle and suffering makes us grieve. Who wouldn&#x27;t grieve? But it&#x27;s not enough to do that. We&#x27;ve got to understand. You&#x27;ve even got to understand Israel&#x27;s point of view.&quot;

====United States====
Schama was a supporter of President Barack Obama and a critic of George W. Bush. He appeared on the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2008 US presidential election, clashing with John Bolton.

==Reception and appraisal==
Niall Ferguson praised Schama, &quot;Amongst [historians] currently writing, Simon Schama stands out as the Dickens of modern historiography: bewilderingly erudite and prolific, passionate in his enthusiasms and armed with the complete contents of the thesaurus.&quot;

<doc id="474567" wikidata="Q1332256" url="?curid=474567" title="Data striping">
<text>In computer data storage, data striping is the technique of segmenting logically sequential data, such as a file, so that consecutive segments are stored on different physical storage devices.

Striping is useful when a processing device requests data more quickly than a single storage device can provide it. By spreading segments across multiple devices which can be accessed concurrently, total data throughput is increased. It is also a useful method for balancing I/O load across an array of disks. Striping is used across disk drives in redundant array of independent disks (RAID) storage, network interface controllers, disk arrays, different computers in clustered file systems and grid-oriented storage, and RAM in some systems.

== Method ==
One method of striping is done by interleaving sequential segments on storage devices in a round-robin fashion from the beginning of the data sequence. This works well for streaming data, but subsequent random accesses will require knowledge of which device contains the data. If the data is stored such that the physical address of each data segment is assigned a one-to-one mapping to a particular device, the device to access each segment requested can be calculated from the address without knowing the offset of the data within the full sequence.

Other methods might be employed in which sequential segments are not stored on sequential devices. Such non-sequential interleaving can have benefits in some error correction schemes.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Advantages of striping include performance and throughput. Sequential time interleaving of data accesses allows the lesser data access throughput of each storage devices to be cumulatively multiplied by the number of storage devices employed. Increased throughput allows the data processing device to continue its work without interruption, and thereby finish its procedures more quickly. This is manifested in improved performance of the data processing.

Because different segments of data are kept on different storage devices, the failure of one device causes the corruption of the full data sequence. In effect, the failure rate of the array of storage devices is equal to the sum of the failure rate of each storage device. This disadvantage of striping can be overcome by the storage of redundant information, such as parity, for the purpose of error correction. In such a system, the disadvantage is overcome at the cost of requiring extra storage.

== Terminology ==
The segments of sequential data written to or read from a disk before the operation continues on the next disk are usually called &quot;chunks&quot;, &quot;strides&quot; or &quot;stripe units&quot;, while their logical groups forming single striped operations are called &quot;strips&quot; or &quot;stripes&quot;. The amount of data in one chunk (stripe unit), often denominated in bytes, is variously referred to as the &quot;chunk size&quot;, &quot;stride size&quot;, &quot;stripe size&quot;, &quot;stripe depth&quot; or &quot;stripe length&quot;. The number of data disks in the array is sometimes called the &quot;stripe width&quot;, but it may also refer to the amount of data within a stripe.

The amount of data in one stride multiplied by the number of data disks in the array (i.e., &quot;stripe depth&quot; times &quot;stripe width&quot;, which in the geometrical analogy would yield an area) is sometimes called the &quot;stripe size&quot; or &quot;stripe width&quot;. &quot;Wide striping&quot; occurs when chunks of data are spread across multiple arrays, possibly all the drives in the system. &quot;Narrow striping&quot; occurs when the chunks of data are spread across the drives in a single array.

== Applications ==
Data striping is used in some databases, such as Sybase, and in certain RAID devices under software or hardware control, such as IBM&#x27;s 9394 RAMAC Array subsystem. File systems of clusters also use striping. Oracle Automatic Storage Management allows ASM files to be either coarse or fine striped.

; RAID
: In some RAID configurations, such as RAID 0, failure of a single member drive of the RAID array causes all stored data to be lost. In other RAID configurations, such as a RAID 5 that contains distributed parity and provides redundancy, if one member drive fails the data can be restored using the other drives in the array.

; LVM2
: Data striping can also be achieved with Linux&#x27;s Logical Volume Management (LVM). The LVM system allows for the adjustment of coarseness of the striping pattern. LVM tools will allow implementation of data striping in conjunction with mirroring. LVM offers the added benefit of read and write caching on NVM Express for slow spinning storage. LVM has other advantages that are not directly related to data striping (like snapshots, dynamic resizing, etc).

; Btrfs and ZFS
: Have RAID like features but with the security of chunk integrity to detect bad blocks, and the added flexibility of adding arbitrary numbers of extra drives. They also have other advantages that are not directly related to data striping (copy-on-write, etc).

<text>Alex &amp; Emma is a 2003 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Rob Reiner and starring Kate Hudson and Luke Wilson. Written by Jeremy Leven, the film is about a writer who must publish a novel in thirty days or face the wrath of loan sharks.

==Plot==
Alex Sheldon, a struggling writer, has writer&#x27;s block and is heavily in debt. His publisher will not give him the money for his pending novel until it is finished. Alex must repay US$100,000 to the Cuban mafia and is given a 30-day ultimatum to pay the money he owes or they will kill him. And the only solution to this big problem is to finish his novel. Or rather, to start it, since he has not written one single line. But he has an idea for the story: A comedy about &quot;the powerlessness of being in love, how love devours the insides of a person like a deadly virus&quot;.

He decides to hire the services of Emma Dinsmore, a stubborn stenographer, for her help to write the novel. The novel tells the story of Adam Shipley, a writer who has been hired to tutor the children of an attractive French woman. She is going through bad economic times, and Adam falls in love, despite the failed temptations of the &quot;au pair&quot;.

As Alex dictates his novel to Emma, the movie cuts away to scenes from the novel, where Adam interacts with a series of nannies, and falls for the last one. As they work together, Emma begins to question his ideas. It starts to affect his life as well as his work. They soon fall for each other.

Alas, after finishing the book, Emma discovers that the French woman in the story was based on a real person, a former girlfriend of Alex. His ex just broke up with her latest boyfriend, sitting with him in a café she invites him to a charity ball. Alex soon realizes that the person he really wants to be with is Emma.

After the book is done and handed in to his publisher he pays off his debt. Then, after much prodding, he convinces Emma to rewrite the ending of the book in which Alex has changed. He shows her he wants her to be an important part of his life. Emma loves it, Alex professes his love to her, and they kiss.

==Cast==
==Production==
Developed under the working title, &quot;Loosely Based on a True Love Story&quot;, the film is loosely based on a true love story of author Fyodor Dostoevsky, who dictated his 1866 novel, &quot;The Gambler&quot; in 30 days in order to pay off a gambling debt and, in the process, fell in love with his young stenographer.

The film was modeled after the 1964 Audrey Hepburn film &quot;Paris When It Sizzles&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;Alex &amp; Emma&quot; was a box-office bomb, grossing $15 million at the box office, against a $30 million production budget.
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 11% approval rating based on 141 reviews, with an average rating of 3.80/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;A dull and unfunny comedy where the leads fail to generate any sparks.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 32 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Todd McCarthy of Variety called it &quot;A desperately slight romantic comedy marked by contrived romance and little comedy.&quot;
Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times observed that the fictional novel within the film was &quot;complete crap&quot; and was critical of the film, but said it was not as bad as Reiner&#x27;s &quot;The Story of Us&quot;.

Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was positive about the cast and wrote: &quot;Reiner gets lucky with his two stars. Wilson has charm to spare, and Hudson brings humor and sexiness to playing Emma and four au pair girls from different countries. But even they can&#x27;t float a balloon with lead in it.&quot; Desson Thomson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;The inside story is weak, dull and head-poundingly boring, and the outside story is only slightly better, thanks to the lukewarm likability of its two stars.&quot;

<doc id="474577" wikidata="Q158752" url="?curid=474577" title="Aesculus">
<text>The genus Aesculus ( or ), with species called buckeye and horse chestnut, comprises 13–19 species of flowering plants in the family Sapindaceae. They are trees and shrubs native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with six species native to North America and seven to 13 species native to Eurasia. Several hybrids occur. &quot;Aesculus&quot; exhibits a classical Arcto-Tertiary distribution. 

Mexican buckeye seedpods resemble the &quot;Aesculus&quot; seedpods, but belong to a different genus.

Carl Linnaeus named the genus &quot;Aesculus&quot; after the Roman name for an edible acorn. Common names for these trees include &quot;buckeye&quot; and &quot;horse chestnut&quot;, though they are not in the same order as the true chestnuts, &quot;Castanea&quot; in the Fagales. Some are also called white chestnut or red chestnut. In Britain, they are sometimes called conker trees because of their link with the game of conkers, played with the seeds, also called conkers.

==Description==
&quot;Aesculus&quot; species have stout shoots with resinous, often sticky, buds, with opposite, palmately divided leaves, often very large—to across in the Japanese horse chestnut, &quot;A. turbinata&quot;. Species are deciduous or evergreen. Flowers are showy, insect- or bird-pollinated, with four or five petals fused into a lobed corolla tube, arranged in a panicle inflorescence. Flowering starts after 80–110 growing degree days. The fruit matures to a capsule diameter, usually globose, containing one to three seeds (often erroneously called a nut) per capsule. Capsules containing more than one seed result in flatness on one side of the seeds. The point of attachment of the seed in the capsule (hilum) shows as a large, circular, whitish scar. The capsule epidermis has &quot;spines&quot; (botanically: prickles) in some species, while other capsules are warty or smooth. At maturity, the capsule splits into three sections to release the seeds.

&quot;Aesculus&quot; seeds were traditionally eaten, after leaching, by the Jōmon people of Japan over about four millennia, until 300 AD.

All parts of the buckeye or horse chestnut tree are moderately toxic, including the nut-like seeds. The toxin affects the gastrointestinal system, causing gastrointestinal disturbances. The USDA notes that the toxicity is due to saponin aescin and glucoside aesculin, with alkaloids possibly contributing.

Native Americans used to crush the seeds and the resulting mash was thrown into still or sluggish waterbodies to stun or kill fish. They then boiled and drained (leached) the fish at least three times to dilute the toxin&#x27;s effects. New shoots from the seeds also have been known to kill grazing cattle.

The genus was considered to be in the ditypic family Hippocastanaceae along with &quot;Billia&quot;, but phylogenetic analyses of morphological and molecular data have more recently caused this family, along with the Aceraceae (maples and &quot;Dipteronia&quot;), to be included in the soapberry family (Sapindaceae).

==Selected species==
The species of &quot;Aesculus&quot; include:
==Cultivation==
The most familiar member of the genus worldwide is the common horse chestnut, &quot;Aesculus hippocastanum&quot;. The yellow buckeye, &quot;Aesculus flava&quot; (syn. &quot;A. octandra&quot;), is also a valuable ornamental tree with yellow flowers, but is less widely planted. Among the smaller species is the bottlebrush buckeye, &quot;Aesculus parviflora&quot;, a flowering shrub. Several other members of the genus are used as ornamentals, and several horticultural hybrids have also been developed, most notably the red horse chestnut &quot;Aesculus&quot; × &quot;carnea&quot;, a hybrid between &quot;A. hippocastanum&quot; and &quot;A. pavia&quot;.

==In art==

Interpretations of the tree leaves can be seen in architectural details in the Reims Cathedral.

==In history==
The horse chestnut was not native to Britain and was only introduced from Europe in 1650 (on the estates of both Dawyck House and Stobo Castle).

The leaf of Aesculus was the official symbol of Kyiv on its coat of arms used from 1969 to 1995. It remains an official symbol of Kyiv to this day.

In the 1840 U.S. presidential campaign, candidate William Henry Harrison called himself the &quot;log cabin and hard cider candidate&quot;, portraying himself sitting in a log cabin made of buckeye logs and drinking hard cider, causing Ohio to become known as &quot;the Buckeye State&quot;.

In Geneva, Switzerland, an official chestnut tree is used to indicate the beginning of the Spring; every year since 1818, the tree is observed by the secretary of the Grand Council of Geneva (the local parliament), and the opening of the first leaf is recorded and announced publicly. Over the years, four different horse chestnut trees have been used for these recordings.

In North America, several native American tribes, particularly in the western and central United States, such as Miwok, Pomo, Yokut, Maidu, historically used Buckeye trees (&quot;Aesculus spp.&quot;) like California Buckeye to harvest fish by utilizing the saponins, which had been extracted by the plant&#x27;s seeds. These tribes used crushed Buckeye nuts to release saponins into streams or shallow water, where the compounds would stun or kill the fish, allowing for easier capture.

<doc id="474578" wikidata="Q196249" url="?curid=474578" title="Professional wrestling holds">
<text>[[Professional wrestling]] holds include a number of set moves and pins used by performers to immobilize their opponents or lead to a submission. This article covers the various pins, stretches and transition holds used in the ring. Some wrestlers use these holds as their finishing maneuvers, often nicknaming them to reflect their character or persona. Moves are listed under general categories whenever possible.

==Stretches==
An element borrowed from professional wrestling&#x27;s catch wrestling origins, stretches (or submission holds) are techniques in which a wrestler holds another in a position that puts stress on the opponent&#x27;s body. Stretches are usually employed to weaken an opponent or to force them to &quot;submit&quot;, either vocally or by &quot;tapping out&quot;: slapping the mat, floor, or opponent with a free hand three times. Many of these holds, when applied vigorously, stretch the opponent&#x27;s muscles or twist their joints uncomfortably, hence the name. Chokes, although not in general stress positions like the other stretches, are usually grouped with stretches as they serve the same tactical purposes. In public performance, for safety&#x27;s sake, stretches are usually not performed to the point where the opponent must submit or risk injury. Likewise, chokes are usually not applied to the point where they cut off the oxygen supply to the opponent&#x27;s brain.

===Head, face, chin, and shoulder stretches===
====Camel clutch====
The wrestler begins the hold by standing over a face-down opponent. The wrestler reaches down to pull the opposing wrestler up slightly, sits on the opponent&#x27;s back, and places both of the opponent&#x27;s arms across their thighs, usually locking at least one by placing the arm in the crook of their knee. The wrestler then reaches forward, cups their hands with their fingers interlocking, grab the opponent&#x27;s chin in their cupped hands, and lean back, pulling on the opponent&#x27;s chin and applying pressure to their back. A camel clutch can also refer simply to a rear chinlock while seated on the back of an opponent, without placing the arms on the thighs. The move was invented by Gory Guerrero in Mexico, where it was called &quot;la de a caballo&quot; (horse-mounting choke), but got its more common name from The Sheik who used it as his finisher. The Iron Sheik also used this version while a heel champion in the WWF. Jinder Mahal also uses this move called the &quot;Punjabi Clutch&quot;. Miro performs a variation he calls &quot;Game Over&quot;, where he stomps on his opponent&#x27;s back before applying the hold, this move was previously called &quot;The Accolade&quot; when Miro was Rusev in the WWE. A standing variation of the camel clutch is also used, with this variation popularized by Scott Steiner in the late 1990s as he used it as his finisher, dubbed the &quot;Steiner Recliner&quot;. His nephew Bron Breakker has also used the standing version as well. Another version of this move sees the wrestler standing over the opponent who&#x27;s face-down reaches for and places the opponent&#x27;s nearest arm around the wrestler&#x27;s far waist before applying the hold. WWE wrestler Veer Mahaan uses this move as a finisher calling it the &quot;Cervical Clutch&quot;. A rolling variation of the camel clutch is also used, with this variation popularized by Maryse Ouellet, dubbed &quot;French Pain&quot;. Big Show uses a kneeling variation of this move called the &quot;Colossal Clutch&quot;.

=====Leg-trap camel clutch=====
The attacking wrestler stands over a face-down opponent, facing the same direction. The wrestler first hooks each of the opponent&#x27;s legs underneath their own armpits as if performing a reverse Boston crab, then reaches down and underneath the opponent&#x27;s chin with both hands, applying a chinlock, and finally leaning back to pull up the opponent&#x27;s head and neck.

Another version of the move is similar to a wheelbarrow facebuster, but instead illegally pulls the hair of the opponent while leaning back to pull up the opponent&#x27;s head and neck.

=====Stepover armlock camel clutch=====
The attacking wrestler stands over a face-down opponent, facing the same direction. The wrestler then grabs one of the opponent&#x27;s arms in a stepover armlock, turning 360° so the opponent&#x27;s arm is bent around the leg of the attacking wrestler. The wrestler will then sandwich the arm between their own leg and the side of the opponent&#x27;s body. The wrestler then reaches forwards and applies a chinlock as in a standard camel clutch, leaning backwards to apply pressure to the upper back and arm.

====Chinlock====

Also known as a rear chinlock, the attacking wrestler crouches down behind a sitting opponent and places their knee into the opponent&#x27;s upper back, then reaches forward and grasps the opponent&#x27;s chin with both hands. The attacker then either pulls straight back on the chin or wrenches it to the side.

=====Front chinlock=====
A maneuver similar to a neck wrench where the wrestler faces a bent-over opponent. The attacking wrestler tucks the opponent&#x27;s top/back of the head into their own chest and wraps an arm around the opponent&#x27;s neck so that their forearm is pressed against the opponent&#x27;s throat. The wrestler then places their own spare arm under the other hand and over the opponent&#x27;s back to lock in the hold, compressing the opponent&#x27;s neck. The attacking wrestler can then arch backwards, pulling the opponent&#x27;s head downward.

=====Reverse chinlock=====
This move sees the attacker kneel behind a sitting opponent and wrap around one arm under the opponent&#x27;s chin and lock their hands. As with a sleeper hold, this move can also be performed from a standing position. Another variation of this hold, referred to as a bridging reverse chinlock, sees the attacking wrestler crouch before a face-down opponent and wrap around one arm under the opponent&#x27;s chin and lock their hands before applying a bridge.

====Clawhold====

Also known as the &quot;iron claw&quot;, the claw involves the attacker gripping the top of the head of the opponent with one hand and squeezing the tips of their fingers into the opponent&#x27;s skull, thereby applying five different points of pressure. This can be transitioned into a clawhold STO or iron claw slam.

There is also double-handed version sometimes known as a head vise. The wrestler performing the hold approaches their opponent from behind and grips their head with both hands. While in the vise, the wrestler can control their opponent by squeezing the temples and bring them down to a seated position where more pressure can be exerted. It was invented and used by Baron von Raschke, as well as many members of the Von Erich family, and Blackjack Mulligan. The double-handed version was a signature submission of The Great Khali, dubbed the &quot;Vice Grip&quot;.

=====Mandible claw=====

A maneuver which, when applied correctly against an individual, is purported to cause intense, legitimate pain. 

The hold is applied when the aggressor places their middle and ring fingers into the opponent&#x27;s mouth, sliding them under the tongue and jabbing into the soft tissue found at the bottom of the mouth. The thumb (and sometimes palm) of the same hand is placed under the jaw, and pressure is applied downward by the middle and ring fingers while the thumb/palm forces the jaw upwards, which is purported to compress the nerves in the jaw and thus render the opponent&#x27;s jaw paralyzed; this, therefore, prevents the opponent from breaking the hold by biting the wrestler&#x27;s fingers, as Mick Foley explained to Vince McMahon when questioned about it during his interviews prior to joining the WWF in 1996. Although Foley popularized the move, it was invented by Sam Sheppard, a physician who, in 1966, took up professional wrestling and was said to have derived the move from his knowledge of human anatomy.
Under the advice of Paul Heyman and with Foley&#x27;s blessing, Bray Wyatt also used the hold as part of his &quot;The Fiend&quot; persona. Bo Dallas also uses the move as part of his &quot;Uncle Howdy&quot; persona as a tribute to Wyatt.

=====Shoulder claw===== 
Similar to a clawhold, the attacking wrestler applies a nerve lock onto the opponent&#x27;s shoulder(s) using their hands and fingers for a submission attempt. It is also called a &quot;Trapezius Claw&quot; due to the muscle group targeted. One variant may see the wrestler instead lock their hands on the opponent&#x27;s neck. It is the finishing hold of African wrestler Shaun Koen of the Africa Wrestling Alliance. This is also known as a &quot;Nerve hold&quot;, due to its association with The Great Khali and was formerly used by Classy Freddie Blassie.

=====Stomach claw=====
Also known as a &quot;stomach vise,&quot; just like the original clawhold, the attacker applies a painful nerve hold to the adversary&#x27;s abdomen, forcing them to submit or pass out. The stomach claw was most famously used by Killer Kowalski, naming it the &quot;Kowalski claw&quot;.

====Crossface====

This neck crank sees the wrestler wrap both hands around the opponent&#x27;s face and pull back, which applies pressure to the neck and shoulder area. The move is performed in several ways, usually from a prone position involving the wrestler trapping one of the opponent&#x27;s arms. Chris Benoit&#x27;s &quot;Crippler Crossface&quot; was a variation that involved the arm trap. Bobby Roode used the same move in TNA, but not in the WWE since 2016. Edge&#x27;s variation is where he used a metal bar on the opponent&#x27;s mouth as the &quot;Glasgow Grin&quot;. A variation is performed from the omoplata position, which also puts pressure on the trapped arm but requires the wrestler to perform it from a seated position. Often referred to as the LeBell Lock, named for Gene LeBell, Daniel Bryan began popularizing the move under the name &quot;Yes! Lock&quot; when he joined WWE. It was used by Taiji Ishimori on rare occasions until he joined NJPW in 2018, where he used it frequently as the &quot;Yes Lock&quot;, named after Bryan. Another variation is performed in a bridging position where the wrestler wraps both hands around the opponent&#x27;s neck and pulls back, which applies pressure to the neck and bridges on the opponent&#x27;s back for added leverage. This variation is used as a submission finisher by Sasha Banks as the &quot;Banks Statement&quot; and by Taka Michinoku as the &quot;Just Facelock&quot;.

=====Arm-trap crossface=====
Used by Chris Benoit as the &quot;Crippler Crossface&quot;; in the adjacent picture, he has pulled so far back that he finished the hold seated, which he did not always do. In Daniel Bryan&#x27;s variation of the move as the &quot;LeBell Lock&quot;, he takes the opponent&#x27;s arm and puts it in an omoplata. From here, the wrestler puts the opponent in a crossface, wrenching the neck and shoulder. This move was also used by Kenta as the &quot;Game Over.&quot;

=====Chickenwing over-the-shoulder crossface=====
The wrestler goes to a fallen opponent and places the opponent&#x27;s nearest arm over the wrestler&#x27;s nearest shoulder before applying the crossface, where the attacking wrestler locks their hands around the opponent&#x27;s chin (or lower face), then pulls back, stretching the opponent&#x27;s neck and shoulder. Former NXT wrestler Johnny Gargano uses this hold as a finishing submission move, calling it the &quot;Garga-No-Escape&quot;. Drew McIntyre briefly used it in TNA as the &quot;Iron Maiden&quot;.

====Scissored armbar crossface====
This is a scissored armbar combined with a crossface. The attacking wrestler traps one of the prone opponent&#x27;s arms in their legs, wraps the opponent&#x27;s other arm under the attacker&#x27;s shoulder, and then applies the crossface. Yuji Nagata first popularized this move named the &quot;Nagata Lock III&quot; as an evolution of his previous hold, the &quot;Nagata Lock II&quot;, a crossface submission. Batista also used this as the &quot;Batista Bite&quot; and PAC uses this as &quot;The Brutalizer&quot; (formerly known as the &quot;Rings of Saturn&quot; during his time in WWE as Neville). Dr. Britt Baker, D.M.D uses this move with a mandible claw hold named the &quot;Lockjaw&quot;. Bryan Danielson recently will sometimes transition into this move while already having applied the &quot;LeBell Lock&quot; effectively making this version of the move a &quot;Scissored armbar omoplata crossface&quot;. Giulia also uses this move dubbed &quot;Bianca&quot;.

====Straight jacket crossface====
Similar to a crossface, this move sees a wrestler standing above a face-down opponent. The wrestler then crosses their opponent&#x27;s arms, keeping them in place with the legs before applying the crossface.

====Fish hook====

The wrestler bends one of their fingers into a hook and uses it to stretch the opponent&#x27;s mouth or nose. An illegal hold under usual rules. Austin Aries uses a half surfboard variation, called &quot;Fish Hook of Doom&quot;, where the opponent is lying face down; they grab one of the opponent&#x27;s wrists with one hand and fish hooks the opponent&#x27;s mouth with the other, and then places his knees against the opponent&#x27;s stretched arm and pulls back with his arms.

====Front chancery====
Also known as &quot;Neck Wrench&quot;, the wrestler faces their opponent, who is bent over. The attacking wrestler tucks their opponent&#x27;s head underneath their armpit and wraps their arm around the neck so that the forearm is pressed against the chin. The wrestler then grabs their own wrist with their free hand, crossing it underneath the opponent&#x27;s armpit and chest to lock the hold in, compressing the opponent&#x27;s neck. The attacking wrestler can then arch backwards, pulling the opponent&#x27;s head forward and thus applying extra pressure on the neck.

=====Front facelock=====
The wrestler faces their opponent, who is bent over. The attacking wrestler tucks the opponent&#x27;s head underneath their armpit and wraps their arm around the head so that the forearm is pressed against the face. From this point on the wrestler can either grab the opponent&#x27;s wrist with the free hand and tucks their own head beneath the opponent&#x27;s armpit and stand upright, locking in the hold, or simply throw the opponent&#x27;s arm over their own shoulder and grab the opponent&#x27;s thighs with the free hand. Similar in execution and function to a front chancery, this lock is often used as a setup for a suplex.

=====Inverted facelock=====
The wrestler stands behind their opponent and bends the opponent backwards. The wrestler tucks the opponent&#x27;s head face-up under their armpit and wraps their arm around the head, so that their forearm is pressed against the back of the opponent&#x27;s neck. The wrestler then pulls the opponent&#x27;s head backwards and up, wrenching the opponent&#x27;s neck. Naomichi Marufuji invented a single underhook variation, called &quot;Perfect Facelock.&quot;

======Bite of the dragon======
Also commonly known as a dragon bite, this move sees the attacking wrestler behind a standing opponent, pulling them backwards into an inverted facelock and wrapping their legs around the opponent&#x27;s body with a body scissors. The attacker then arches backwards, putting pressure on the opponent&#x27;s neck and spine. This move is used on an opponent trapped within the ring ropes, which makes the move illegal under most match rules.

======Stretch plum======
The wrestler applies an inverted facelock to a seated opponent, places their far leg between the opponent&#x27;s legs, and pushes their near leg&#x27;s knee against the opponent&#x27;s back. The wrestler then pulls the opponent&#x27;s head backwards with their arms and the opponent&#x27;s far leg outwards with their leg. Used by Taichi as &quot;Seteii Juhjiro.&quot;

=====Side headlock=====

In this hold, a wrestler who is facing away from an opponent wraps their arm around the neck of an opponent. This is also called a &quot;reverse chancery&quot;. Though this is an often-used rest hold, it is also sometimes the beginning of a standard bulldog move.

=====Three-quarter facelock=====
The wrestler stands in front of the opponent while both people are facing the same direction, with some space in between the two. Then, the wrestler moves slightly to the left while still positioned in front of the opponent. The wrestler then uses the near hand to reach back and grab the opponent from behind the head, thus pulling the opponent&#x27;s head above the wrestler&#x27;s shoulder. Sometimes the free arm is placed at the top of the opponent&#x27;s head. The move is also referred to as a &quot;European headlock&quot;, due to its prominence in European wrestling. The two-handed version sees the wrestler use both hands and is sometimes referred to as a &quot;¾ chancery&quot;, &quot;side head chancery&quot; and, most often, a &quot;cravate&quot;. This hold is a staple of European style wrestling and technical wrestling influenced by European wrestling. An inverted version of the cravate is used by Chris Hero as part of his &quot;Hangman&#x27;s Clutch&quot; submissions in which the hand positioning is the same as a normal cravate but the facelock is connected around the face of the opponent, not from behind the opponent&#x27;s head, thus pulling the opponent&#x27;s head backwards rather than forwards, putting significant pressure on the neck by stretching it backwards and in other directions toward which the neck would not normally bend. This can also be a setup move for the &quot;3/4 Facelock Jawbreaker&quot;, also known as the &quot;Stunner&quot;, made famous by Steve Austin.

====Headscissors====
Also referred to as a neckscissors, this hold sees a wrestler approach a supine opponent and sit next to them before turning onto their side towards the opponent and wrapping their legs around either side of the opponent&#x27;s head, crossing the top leg after it has gone around the opponent&#x27;s chin. The wrestler then tightens their grip to choke an opponent by compressing their throat. WWE wrestler Naomi has a crucifix variation calling it &quot;Feel the Glow&quot; (formerly called &quot;Starstruck&quot; during her run in Impact Wrestling as Trinity).

=====Standing headscissors=====
The wrestler tucks a bent-over opponent&#x27;s head in between their legs or thighs. In professional wrestling this move is used to set up powerbombs or piledrivers. A couple of variants are often to be seen.

In the first, having the opponent&#x27;s head tuck between the attacker&#x27;s knees, the latter leaps up and releases the hold while landing, causing a whiplash on the opponent&#x27;s neck. Wrestlers as André the Giant or Junkyard Dog were famed for its using.

In the second one and holding the opponent in the same position, the attacker twists the legs from the hip in a &quot;Neck crank&quot; variant. Popularized by Curt Hennig.

====Nelson hold====
The nelson hold in professional wrestling usually takes the form of the full nelson, half nelson, or three-quarter nelson. In all three variations, the wrestler slips either one or both arms underneath the opponent&#x27;s armpits from behind and locks their hands behind their neck, pushing the opponent&#x27;s head forward against their chest. For a full nelson, the attacker slips both their arms under the opponent&#x27;s armpits and locks their hands behind their opponent&#x27;s neck. The half and three-quarter nelsons are usually transition holds, as they are in amateur wrestling. For the half nelson the attacker slips one arm under the opponent&#x27;s armpit and places it on the neck. The three-quarter nelson is done by performing a half nelson using one hand and passing the other hand underneath the opponent from the same side. The passing hand goes under the opponent&#x27;s neck and around the far side to the top of the neck, where it is locked with the other hand around the neck. The full nelson, which is illegal in amateur wrestling, is often used as a submission maneuver by certain wrestlers, such as Chris Masters, as shown in the accompanying picture. Ken Patera performed a variation he called the &quot;Swinging Neckbreaker&quot; (not to be confused with the neckbreaker variation), where he would lock the hold on and lift the opponent off the ground, then spin them in the air. There is also an inverted version where instead of performing the move from behind the opponent, the wrestler stands in front of the opponent and uses the move in the same way as the normal full nelson. Chris Masters and Bobby Lashley uses a standing variation called the &quot;Master Lock&quot; and the &quot;Hurt Lock&quot; respectively, where they lock the nelson in and swing their opponent back and forth alternating pressure between their shoulders. Lashley sometimes locks his opponents into a body scissors to immobilize them. The normal Full Nelson hold was also used by the late WWF superstar Hercules. 

=====Sugar hold=====
An old catch wrestling hold made somewhat famous by Stu Hart, this variation of a nelson hold involves the wrestler applying the hold forces the opponent prone on the mat and drives their knees into the opponent&#x27;s upper back.

====STF====

STF is short for &quot;Stepover Toehold Facelock&quot;. This hold is performed on an opponent who is lying face down on the mat. The wrestler grabs one of the opponent&#x27;s legs and places the opponent&#x27;s ankle between their thighs. The wrestler then lies on top of the opponent&#x27;s back and locks their arms around the opponent&#x27;s head. The wrestler then pulls back, stretching the opponent&#x27;s back, neck, and knee. The move was popularised by Lou Thesz, albeit it is a traditional catch wrestling move pre-dating Lou Thesz by many decades; it was further popularised by Masahiro Chono and John Cena, who named it the &quot;STFU&quot;. Samoa Joe, Jazz, Erik Watts and Nikki Bella have also used this move.

=====Cross-legged STF=====
Starting in the same position as a regular STF, the attacker takes both the opponent&#x27;s legs, bends them at the knees, and crosses them, placing one ankle in the other leg&#x27;s knee-pit. The wrestler then grabs the free ankle and places that ankle between their thighs. They then lie on top of the opponent&#x27;s back and lock their arms around the opponent&#x27;s face. The wrestler then pulls back, stretching the opponent&#x27;s back, neck, and knees. Jack Perry uses this as the &quot;Snare Trap&quot;, while Kazuchika Okada uses a kneeling version called the &quot;Red Ink&quot;. An arm-trap variation of this move was invented by WWE wrestler William Regal and is currently known as a &quot;Regal Stretch&quot;.

=====Muta lock=====

The inverted Indian deathlock facelock, or a &quot;Muta lock&quot;. The wrestler first takes the opponent&#x27;s legs then, bends them at the knees, and crosses them, placing one ankle in the other leg&#x27;s knee-pit before then turning around so that they are facing away from the opponent and places one of their feet into the triangle created by the opponent&#x27;s crossed legs. The wrestler then places the opponent&#x27;s free ankle under their knee-pit and bridges backwards to reach over their head and locks their arms around the opponent&#x27;s head. Invented by The Great Muta, this move has been adapted and performed by various wrestlers such as Melina Perez (&quot;California Dream&quot;) and Emma (&quot;Emma Lock&quot;) as finishing moves, signature moves, and setups to finishers.

=====STS=====
Short for &quot;stepover toehold sleeper&quot;, this hold is a modified version of an STF in which the wrestler wraps their arm around the neck of the opponent in a sleeper hold instead of pulling back on the head of the opponent. Popularised by Masahiro Chono.

=====Strangle Hold Alpha=====
Essentially a reverse crucifix armbar with neck submission. The opponent is on their stomach with the attacker to their side, grabbing the near arm and pulling the opponent on their side before stepping over their head with the same leg (if the attacker grabbed the right arm, he&#x27;ll step over with the right leg). Using that leg as leverage, he&#x27;ll push the opponent&#x27;s head downwards and drop to their side so that the opponent must support their own body weight on their squeezed neck. The attacker then uses their free leg to complete the reverse crucifix armbar, trying to hyperextend the elbow.

=====Strangle Hold Beta=====
Essentially a scissored armbar with neck submission. The opponent is on their stomach while the attacker reaches under one of the opponent&#x27;s arms, locking their hands together. The attacker then drops to the side opposite that of the arm that they grabbed (if they grabbed the right arm, they will fall on their left side). The opponent will thus be on their back, with one of the attacker&#x27;s legs under the victim&#x27;s upper back and hooking their free arm. The attacker throws their other leg over the opponent&#x27;s trapped arm and then behind the opponent&#x27;s neck, pushing it forward. The attacker can now roll towards their back, creating more pressure on the neck while hyperextending the opponent&#x27;s arm across their own chest.

=====Strangle Hold Gamma=====
Essentially a step-over armbar with neck submission. The opponent is on their back, wrestler standing to their side and reaching down to grab the opponent&#x27;s far arm, pulling up. Wrapping their same leg (if they grabbed the left arm, they will use their left leg) around the back of the opponent&#x27;s neck (against the back of their knee) and bracing their foot against the front of the other shoulder, they steps over their opponent with their other leg, squatting down.

===Armlocks===
====Figure-four armlock====

Also known as a keylock, &quot;Top shoulder lock&quot;, &quot;Americana&quot;, and &quot;ude-garami&quot;, (a term borrowed from judo). This armlock sees the wrestler grappling the opponent&#x27;s wrist with the similar hand (for example, if they use the right arm, they would grab the opponent&#x27;s right wrist), and with the opponent&#x27;s wrist still clutched, the wrestler bends the opponent&#x27;s arm (of the grappled wrist) towards or behind the opponent&#x27;s head. Then, the wrestler passes their other free arm through the &quot;hole&quot; formed by the opponent&#x27;s bent arm under the biceps, and then catches the opponent&#x27;s grappled wrist. This would result in the opponent&#x27;s arm being shaped into a &quot;4&quot;. As the opponent&#x27;s wrist is grabbed by both opponent&#x27;s hands, along with the bent arm, this applies effective pressure into the opponent. The maneuver can be executed on a standing or a downed (facing upwards) opponent. This move has been used by many wrestlers for many years.

=====Rope-hung figure-four armlock=====
The wrestler approaches an opponent lying against any set of ropes and grabs one of the opponent&#x27;s wrists with their similar arm. The wrestler then pins the arm with the grappled wrist against the second or top rope to the outside of the ring, passes their other arm from under the opponent&#x27;s biceps, and grapples the opponent&#x27;s wrist. The whole maneuver would force the opponent&#x27;s arm to be bent in the number &quot;4&quot; shape, applying more pressure as the arm is trapped between the second or top rope. The rope-hung figure-four armlock can be also grappled through the bottom rope, if the opponent is lying against it.

==== Omoplata ====

The omoplata (AKA ashi-sankaku-garami in judo) is an armlock that targets the shoulder. The locking mechanism is similar to the kimura lock, but instead of using a figure-four, it is applied using a leg. The omoplata can be applied from the guard, by placing one leg under the opponent&#x27;s armpit and turning 180 degrees in the direction of that leg, so that the leg moves over the back of the opponent and entangles the opponent&#x27;s arm. By controlling the opponent&#x27;s body and pushing the arm perpendicularly away from the opponent&#x27;s back, pressure can be put on the opponent&#x27;s shoulder. It is also possible to put pressure on the elbow joint by bending the leg entangling the arm and twisting it in a specific manner. It is usually done to set up the opponent for a crossface. This move can also be known by the underrepresented term coil lock in catch wrestling. This move is notably used by Axiom during his time as A-Kid.

=====Stepover armlock=====
Also known as a spinning armlock. The standing attacking wrestler grabs the wrist of a face down opponent, pulling it towards themselves, then steps over the opponent&#x27;s outstretched arm, placing one leg to either side. From this point, the wrestler turns 360 degrees, simultaneously bending the arm of the opponent around the attacker&#x27;s own leg. The wrestler can over-rotate or turn again to apply more pressure on the arm.

The stepover armlock is similar in execution to the spinning toe hold, except that the wrist is held instead of the foot.

====Armbar====
The wrestler takes hold of the opponent&#x27;s arm and twists it, putting pressure on the shoulder and elbow. This may sometimes be preceded by an arm wrench. The armbar&#x27;s innovation was reportedly 200 years ago, but its true origins remain unknown.

=====Cross armbar=====

Also known as a cross armbreaker or straight armbar. The wrestler sits on either side of an opponent who is lying either prone or supine on the mat, with the wrestler&#x27;s legs scissoring one of the opponent&#x27;s arms. The wrestler then grabs hold of the wrist of that arm and pulls it upwards, causing hyper extension of the shoulder and elbow. Wrestlers Alberto Del Rio (often the flying variant, see below) and Ronda Rousey perform this move a finisher. Bryan Danielson popularized and invented a variation, dubbed the &quot;Danielson Special&quot;, where he would flip his opponent with a butterfly suplex before locking in the cross armbar.

======Flying cross armbar======
This variation begins with the wrestler standing on either side of the bent-over opponent. The wrestler then steps over one of the opponent&#x27;s arms while holding that arm&#x27;s wrist, and then rolls or twists their body in mid-air while holding the wrist, forcing the opponent down to their back and ending in a cross armbar. This variant has been used by Alberto Del Rio, A.J. Styles and Asuka. Kushida uses a variation, where goes on the top rope and places his opponent on the turnbuckle and delivers the move.

=====Crucifix armbar=====
The wrestler, situated perpendicular to and behind the opponent, holds the opponent&#x27;s arm with both arms, pulling the arm across their chest. The wrestler then holds the other arm with their legs, stretching the shoulders back in a crucifying position and hyperextending the arm.

===Fujiwara armbar===

Invented by Yoshiaki Fujiwara, it is also known as a short &quot;armbar&quot;. With the opponent lying prone, the wrestler lies on the opponent&#x27;s back, at a 90° angle to them, putting some or all of their weight on the opponent to prevent them from moving. The opponent&#x27;s arm is then hooked and pulled back into their body, stretching the forearms, biceps, and pectoral muscles. Variations of this can include clasping the opponent&#x27;s hand instead of hooking the upper arm, for extra leverage and bridging out, while performing the move to increase leverage and immobilize the opponent. A kneeling variation also exists. Becky Lynch uses it as the &quot;Dis-arm-her&quot;, where the attacking wrestler takes a face-down opponent&#x27;s arm in a kneeling position, adding pressure by pulling back on the arm. A reverse version also exists, with the opponent lying on their back, the wrestler lies on the mat, putting some or all of their weight on the opponent to prevent them from moving. The opponent&#x27;s arm is then hooked and pulled back into their body, stretching the forearms, biceps, and pectoral muscles. The regular hold is used by Deonna Purrazzo, Timothy Thatcher, and MJF, the latter calling the move the &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;. while the bridging version was used by Mark Haskins as the &quot;Star Armbar&quot; while Tommaso Ciampa briefly uses it as his submission finisher. Mexican luchador Místico innovated a variation in which he performs a tilt-a-whirl on the opponent them slams face first with a single-arm takedown and uses the submission hold called the &quot;La Mistica&quot;. A double arm variation is used by Deonna Purrazzo in addition to her regular variation; she calls the double arm variation &quot;Venus de Milo&quot;.

==== Hammerlock ====

The wrestler grabs the wrist of the opponent so that the arm is held bent against their back, and their hand is forced upwards towards the neck, thereby applying pressure to the shoulder joint. It is used by many wrestlers in the beginning of the match. It was used by Ed Lewis and Bruno Sammartino. George Steele used an elevated version of the Hammerlock.

==== Headscissors armbar ====
The wrestler wraps their legs around the opponent&#x27;s head in a headscissors, facing towards the opponent, then grabs one of the opponent&#x27;s arms and wrenches it backwards, causing pressure on the shoulder and elbow of the opponent. This can often be performed on a standing wrestler when preceded by a tilt-a-whirl, which was popularized by Gail Kim, who dubbed it the &quot;Flying Dragon&quot;.

===Scissored armbar===
Nicknamed the &quot;Stu-Lock&quot;, in honor of Stu Hart who used the move, the wrestler approaches a prone opponent from the side. The wrestler then &quot;scissors&quot; (clasps) the near arm of the opponent with one or both legs from a standing position and takes hold of the far arm of the opponent with both hands, forcing the opponent onto their side and placing stress on both shoulder joints, as well as making it harder for the opponent to breathe. It can cause serious injury to the opponent if held for long. Often confused with the octopus hold, it was popularized by Perry Saturn as the &quot;Rings of Saturn&quot;.

===Seated armbar===

Known as &quot;Ashi-gatame&quot; in Japan and a &quot;pumphandle armbar&quot; in America. The wrestler sits facing away on either side of an opponent who is lying prone on the mat, with the wrestler&#x27;s legs scissoring one of the opponent&#x27;s arms. The wrestler then grabs hold of the wrist of that arm, pulling it upwards, causing hyperextension of the shoulder and elbow. Yuji Nagata has used the move while rolling his eyes backwards called the &quot;Shirone&quot; (white eyes). Satoshi Kojima uses a slight variation where both of his legs are on the same side of the opponent&#x27;s arm. He calls it the &quot;Koji MAX hold&quot;.

==== Short arm scissors ====

The opponent is on their back with the attacker sitting beside them and grabbing the nearest arm. The attacker bends the opponent&#x27;s arm and reaches through with one of their own. The attacker places one of their legs across the wrist of the opponent and grabs their own ankle to lock the hold. The attacker pulls up with their arm while forcing the victim&#x27;s wrist down with their leg and applies pressure to the victim&#x27;s elbow. Known in combat sport as the &quot;bicep slicer&quot;.

==== Tiger feint crucifix armbar ====
The opponent begins supine, lying with their back on the bottom or second rope and facing into the ring. The wrestler runs towards the opponent and jumps through the second and top rope while holding on to the ropes, then swings around and grapevines the opponent&#x27;s arms, applying a crucifix armbar.

====Barely legal====
From behind a seated opponent, the wrestler grabs one of the opponent&#x27;s elbows and pulls it up and backward. The wrestler then bends the wrist and forces the open palm of the opponent&#x27;s hand into their chest, putting pressure on the wrist. The maneuver&#x27;s invention is credited to Barry Darsow, who was the person who gave it its name.

====Chickenwing====
The wrestler grabs their opponent&#x27;s arm, pulling it around behind the opponent&#x27;s back. This stretches the pectorals and shoulder joint and immobilizes the arm. This is a legitimate controlling or debilitating hold and is commonly used by police officers in the United States to subdue uncooperative persons for arrest. This hold is used by Frankie Kazarian.

=====Bridging chickenwing=====
Also known as a bridging wrist lock. The wrestler approaches a prone opponent, lying down on their stomach. The wrestler grabs either of the opponent&#x27;s arms and pulls it to their back (resulting the arm being bent behind the opponent&#x27;s back). The wrestler then rolls or flips forward into a bridge, applying pressure on the wrist and elbow.

=====Crossface chickenwing=====

In this variation, the wrestler first performs the chickenwing to one of the opponent&#x27;s arms, then takes their other arm, wraps it around the opponent&#x27;s neck, and then either pulls the opponent&#x27;s head to the side, which puts pressure on the neck and shoulders, or leaves the arm tucked under the chin as in a one-armed sleeper hold. Depending on the wrestler&#x27;s preference, they may clasp their hands together to secure the hold, as Triple H shows in the adjacent picture. In many cases, the wrestler will drop to the mat and lock the opponent in a bodyscissor lock to make escape even more difficult. The crossface chickenwing is mostly identified with Bob Backlund, who used the hold as a finishing maneuver following his comeback to the WWF in the mid-1990s and won his second world championship using the hold. Backlund&#x27;s version of the hold incorporates the bodyscissors portion. former NXT Rookie and WWE superstar Darren Young used this move right before he was released from the WWE after being trained by Bob Backlund. Bryan Danielson used the move early in his career. Marty Scurll uses it as finishing move. Asuka also uses the bodyscissors variation as a finisher dubbed the &quot;Asuka Lock&quot;. Sean Waltman and Norman Smiley used both the standing and bodyscissors versions of this move as finishers dubbed the &quot;Buzzkiller&quot; and &quot;Norman&#x27;s Conquest&quot; respectively. A version of this move has also been performed to a seated opponent.

====Double chickenwing====

This hold sees the wrestler standing behind the opponent facing the same direction, and then hooking both the opponent&#x27;s arms under their armpits. The move is known for being used for the tiger suplex.

=====Bridging double chickenwing=====
Also referred to as a &quot;bridging grounded double chickenwing&quot; or &quot;Cattle Mutilation&quot;. The wrestler stands over a prone opponent&#x27;s back and tucks the opponent&#x27;s arms under their armpits. From this point, the wrestler then rolls or flips into a bridge, pulling the opponent&#x27;s arms and applying pressure on them. The move origin is unknown, as many wrestlers used between the 80s and in the early 1990s. A version where the opponent sits in a seated position (with older origins) was first called &quot;Cattle Mutilation&quot; by Poison Sawada Julie, a name that has also been applied to the grounded version made famous by Bryan Danielson. Asuka also uses this variation.

=====Elevated double chickenwing=====
This variation of the double chickenwing sees the wrestler wrenching the opponent up while still holding them in the double chickenwing. The hold is usually transitioned into a chickenwing facebuster. The Elevated double chickenwing was famously used by Ricky Steamboat in his best 2 out of 3 falls match with Ric Flair. Its facebuster version was later made popular by Beth Phoenix, calling the move the Glam Slam. Former Impact wrestler Jazz also used this move dubbed the &quot;Bitch Clamp&quot;.

=====Scorpion cross lock=====
Also known as an inverted sharpshooter combined with a double chickenwing, this hold sets up the same as the sharpshooter, with the opponent supine on the mat with the applying wrestler stepping between the opponent&#x27;s legs with their right leg and wrapping the opponent&#x27;s legs at shin level around that leg. However, instead of stepping over the opponent to flip them, the applying wrestler flips the opponent over from left-to-right, keeping the opponent in front of them. The applying wrestler then leans over the opponent and grabs their arms, applying a double chicken wing to the opponent. The applying wrestler then squats back, lifting the opponent&#x27;s torso into the air. The move was used by Bull Nakano and formerly used by the former SmackDown general manager Paige as the PTO.

====Kimura lock====

This technique is also known as a single chickenwing hammerlock or a double wrist lock. A judo submission named the reverse (&quot;gyaku&quot;) &quot;ude-garami&quot;, and popularly named and innovated by Masahiko Kimura, after he broke Hélio Gracie&#x27;s arm with it. It is a commonly used submission in judo, BJJ and MMA. The move is performed when a wrestler grasps the opponent&#x27;s left wrist with their right hand. The wrestler then places their left arm over and around the opponent&#x27;s arm while grasping their own wrist. This move is ambidextrous and can be performed either from a standing position, or a grounded position where the attacker applies a variation of body scissors. This move was popularized in WWE by Brock Lesnar, where he would use it often to (kayfabe) break his opponent&#x27;s arm. Kushida also uses the hold as the &quot;Hoverboard Lock&quot;. 

====Wrist lock====

Sometimes preceded by an arm wrench, the wrestler grasps the opponent&#x27;s hand and twists backwards, placing pressure on the wrist. While this can inflict pain on its own, it is most often used as a transition hold, leading into either a hammer lock, an elbow to the held arm, or kicks to the opponent&#x27;s abdominal area. Another form of wrist lock, sometimes known as a figure four wrist lock, involves the wrestler (after applying the initial wrist lock with the left hand) threading their right arm through the gap the two arms provide, forming a &quot;4&quot;, and providing leverage on the wrist lock.

===Body locks===
====Bear hug====


A wrestler stands in front of an opponent and locks their hands around the opponent, squeezing them. Often the wrestler will shake their body from side to side in order to generate more pain around the ribs and spine. The move can be done while the opponent is standing upright or lifted off the ground, usually with their legs wrapped around the attacking wrestler&#x27;s waist. Frequently used by powerhouse style wrestlers, this rather simple to apply hold is used by heels and faces alike. An inverted variation is also possible, which was commonly used by Big John Studd. In both versions, one or both of the opponent&#x27;s arms can be pinned to their sides. The late George Hackenschmidt is known for innovating the move. This was also used as a finisher by Hulk Hogan early in his career called the &quot;Golden Squeeze&quot; in his WWF debut match against Ted DiBiase in 1979 and the late WWWF superstar the late Bruno Sammartino who also used it as a finisher to win his first WWE Championship.

==== Side bear hug ====
The attacker stands to the side of an opponent and locks their hands around their torso. One or both of the arms can be pinned.

====Waist lock====
A wrestler stands behind the opponent and then wraps both of their arms around them in a reverse bear hug, sometimes clutching their hands together by the wrist for added pressure. This usually sets up a German suplex or a waistlock takedown.

====Body scissors====
A wrestler approaches a sitting opponent from in front, behind, or either side. The attacking wrestler then sits next to the opponent and wraps their legs around the opponent, crossing their ankles and then tightening their grip by squeezing together their thighs or straightening their legs to compress the opponent&#x27;s torso. This hold is often used in conjunction with a hold applied to the head or the arms in order to restrain the opponent.

====Body triangle====
Body triangle or Figure-four body lock is achieved by first crossing the ankles, grasping the heel of one foot and pulling that foot into the opposite knee, this creates the signature “4”. The attacker can apply different submissions. It is usually done from back mount or closed guard. Some common submissions from this position are the triangle choke, armbar, and other types of armlocks and chokeholds.

====Back and torso stretches====
=====Abdominal stretch=====
Also known as a &quot;cobra twist&quot;, this hold begins with a wrestler facing their opponent&#x27;s side. The wrestler first straddles one of the opponent&#x27;s legs, then reaches over the opponent&#x27;s near arm with the arm close to the opponent&#x27;s back and locks it. Squatting and twisting to the side flexes the opponent&#x27;s back and stretches their abdomen, which also means leaving their abs exposed and open to further holds, such as a claw to the victim&#x27;s abs, or simply punching them. This move can also be applied to a seated opponent or rolling sideways while standing to ground them keeping the hold in place as well as possibly trying to score a pinfall if both the opponent&#x27;s shoulders are touching the mat. The amateur wrestling analogue is the guillotine, also known as a &quot;twister&quot;.

Another version of this move sees the wrestler, straddles one of the opponent&#x27;s legs, then reaches over the opponent&#x27;s near arm with the arm close to the opponent&#x27;s back and places both hands against the opponent&#x27;s neck and pushes against it applying additional pressure. This version is called the &quot;Abdominal neck wrench&quot;.

=====Boston crab=====

This typically starts with the opponent on their back, and the wrestler standing and facing them. The wrestler hooks each of the opponent&#x27;s legs in one of their arms and then turns the opponent face-down, stepping over them in the process. The final position has the wrestler in a semi-sitting position and facing away from the opponent, with the opponent&#x27;s back and legs bent back toward their face. Chris Jericho uses this move in a high angle version, calling it the &quot;Walls of Jericho&quot;. Lance Storm also performs this move with both versions, including the regular Boston crab and single-leg Boston crab. He usually sets it up from a single-leg takedown or a roll-through called the &quot;Calgary Crab&quot;. Samoa Joe also uses an inverted powerbomb as a setup into the Boston crab. Charlotte Flair uses this move to set up for the &quot;Figure Eight Leglock&quot;. An inverted variation is also possible, commonly used by Colt Cabana as the &quot;Billy Goat&#x27;s Curse&quot;.

=====Bow and arrow hold=====
The wrestler kneels on the opponent&#x27;s back with both knees, hooking the head with one arm and the legs with the other. They then roll back so that the opponent is suspended on their knees above them, facing up. The wrestler pulls down with both arms while pushing up with the knees to bend the opponent&#x27;s back.

=====Gory special=====
The Gory special is a back-to-back backbreaker submission hold. It was invented by Gory Guerrero in Mexico. The wrestler, while behind the opponent, facing in the opposing direction, hooks their arms under the opponent&#x27;s. From this position, the wrestler lifts the opponent up, usually by bending. This move can be used as a submission hold or can be used for a neckbreaker slam, or a facebuster takedown.

=====La Nieblina=====
Also known as an &quot;over-rotated Delfin Clutch&quot;, the wrestler approaches face-up opponent then grabs and folds the opponent&#x27;s left arm over their lower torso, their left leg over their left arm, their right arm over their left leg, and the right leg over the right arm and left leg at the point where the ankle and wrist are placed together. From here, the wrestler rolls the opponent face first onto the mat, with their legs and arms tied together, sandwiched between the mat. The wrestler then sits on top of their opponent using their own body weight to apply pressure with the option to grab and crank back on the right leg. This hold was innovated by Mr. Niebla and is best associated with Miliano Collection A.T. known as the &quot;Paradise Lock&quot;. 

An inverted version of this moves exists with the opponent on their stomach, the wrestler grabs the opponent&#x27;s right arm and places it on top of their back, grabs and stacks the right arm with their right leg, then puts the left arm on top of the right leg, and then finally immobilizes the other limbs by placing the left leg on top of the rest. Next, the wrestler turns their opponent over so that they are on their knees with all four of their limbs trapped underneath. The wrestler then sits on top of the opponent forcing them into a bridge and pressing down on their body.

=====Lotus lock=====
The wrestler grabs the opponent&#x27;s arms and wraps their legs on the outside of them, so the wrestler&#x27;s feet meet at the back of the neck of the opponent and exert a downward pressure, akin to applying a full nelson but by using the legs.

====Octopus hold====

Also known as an &quot;Octopus stretch&quot; and &quot;Manji-gatame&quot; (Japanese version), the wrestler stands behind the opponent and hooks a leg over the opponent&#x27;s opposite leg. The wrestler then forces the opponent to one side, traps one of the opponent&#x27;s arms with their own arm and drapes their free leg over the neck of the opponent, forcing it downward. This elevates the wrestler and places all the weight of the wrestler on the opponent. The wrestler has one arm free, which can be used for balance. It was invented by Antonio Inoki. AJ Lee and Katsuyori Shibata used this move as their finisher, with the former calling it the &quot;Black Widow&quot;. Zack Sabre Jr., Jonathan Gresham and Akira Tozawa uses it as submission finishers.

=====Rocking chair=====
Known as &quot;&quot;La mecedora&quot; (Spanish for Rocking chair) or &quot;La campana&quot; (The bell) in Mexico. The opponent is face down on the mat, with the attacker bending both of their legs up and tucking their ankles against their armpits. The attacker then reaches down and grabs both of the opponent&#x27;s arms before sitting down, &quot;rocking&quot; back and forth and stretching the opponent&#x27;s back.

=====Mexican Surfboard=====

Also known as a &quot;Romero special&quot;. The Mexican surfboard hold first sees a wrestler stand behind a fallen opponent, who is lying stomach down on the floor. The wrestler places one foot down just above each of the opponent&#x27;s knees and bends their legs up, hooking them around their own knees; at this point the wrestler grasps both of their opponent&#x27;s wrists (usually slapping the opponent&#x27;s back in an attempt to bring the arms in reach), and can either do three things: Remain standing, fall into a seated position, or fall backwards while compressing the opponent&#x27;s shoulder blades and lifting them off the ground. This can see the wrestler fall to a seated position or go onto their back, lifting the opponent skyward, which will increase pressure on the opponent but put the wrestler in risk of pinning their own shoulders to the mat. It is mostly performed by Jushin Thunder Liger, Natalya Neidhart and Daniel Bryan as a signature and by Rito Romero as a finisher.

======Cross-armed surfboard======
This version of a surfboard sees a standing or kneeling wrestler take hold of both of a kneeling or seated opponent&#x27;s wrists and cross their arms over, applying pressure to both the opponent&#x27;s arms and shoulders. Sometimes the wrestler may place their foot or knee on the opponent&#x27;s upper back in order to exert even more pressure.

======Seated surfboard======
Another version of a surfboard, which is known as a &quot;seated surfboard stretch&quot; but referred to as a &quot;modified surfboard stretch&quot;. Most often applied by a standing wrestler against a prone opponent, but may also be applied by a seated wrestler or against a seated or kneeling opponent, sees the wrestler grasp both of their opponent&#x27;s wrists while placing their foot or knee on the opponent&#x27;s upper back, pulling back on the arms to compress the opponent&#x27;s shoulder blades. In &quot;lucha libre&quot;, the variation performed against a kneeling opponent is called La Cavernaria, after Cavernario Galindo.

====Wishbone====
The wrestler stands at the feet of a supine opponent. They grab and lift the opponent&#x27;s near leg with both hands, while placing their far foot onto arch the opponent of the far foot. Applying pressure stretches groin of the opponent. The wrestler may also twist the opponent&#x27;s leg at the foot for additional pressure. This move shares the same name as but is not to be confused with the double-team move.

===Backbreaker===

==== Backbreaker hold ====

This basic backbreaker submission involves the wrestler laying the opponent&#x27;s back across one knee, then, while placing one hand on the opponent&#x27;s chin and the other on their knee, the wrestler pushes down to bend the opponent around their knee. This move is usually performed at the end of a pendulum backbreaker, a move which sees a wrestler drop an opponent down on the wrestler&#x27;s knee, thus weakening the back before the hold is applied, as well as setting the opponent in a proper position.

==== Argentine backbreaker rack ====
Innovated by Antonino Rocca, this submission hold, also known as a Torture Rack or simply a rack, sees the attacking wrestler carrying the opponent face-up across their own shoulders, before hooking the opponent&#x27;s head with one hand and a leg with the other to then pull down on both ends to hyperextend the opponent&#x27;s back and force a submission. Wrestler Lex Luger was famous for using it as a finisher. Hercules also used this as a finisher move as well. 

A backbreaker drop variation of this submission move sees the attacking wrestler first hold an opponent up for the Argentine backbreaker rack before dropping to the mat in a sitting or kneeling position, thus flexing the opponent&#x27;s back with the impact of the drop. Another version sees the wrestler hold their opponent in the Argentine backbreaker rack before dropping into a sitting or kneeling position while simultaneously throwing the opponent off their shoulders, causing the opponent to roll in midair and fall to the mat in a face-down position. Nikki Bella has used both variations as a finisher in WWE.

A variation of the Argentine backbreaker rack, known as the La Reinera, sees the opponent held across the wrestler&#x27;s upper back rather than their shoulders/neck. Often set up by a tilt-a-whirl, the opponent ends up suspended with one arm hooked behind and both legs hooked by the wrestler&#x27;s other arm. Rolando Vera was credited with inventing the move.

Another Argentine backbreaker rack variation called the La Atlántida, favored by Mexican luchador Atlantis, sees the attacking wrestler holding the opponent across the shoulders and behind the head in a side-lying position facing towards the rear, then pulling down on the head and one leg to laterally bending the opponent.

A variation of the La Atlántida, sometimes known as the &quot;Accordion Rack&quot;, sees the opponent held similarly in a side-lying position facing the rear across the attacking wrestler&#x27;s shoulders, but with the opponent&#x27;s lower back curvature directly behind the wrestler&#x27;s head, and instead of pulling downwards the wrestler will chest fly forward to bend the opponent, sometimes to the point that the opponent&#x27;s heel touches the head. However, this move is mainly limited to opponents with great flexibility. It was utilized by wrestlers like Awesome Kong.

==== Canadian backbreaker rack ====
Also known technically as the overhead gutwrench backbreaker rack or Sammartino backbreaker this sees an attacking wrestler first lift an opponent up so the opponent&#x27;s back is resting on the wrestler&#x27;s shoulder, with the opponent&#x27;s head pointing in the direction that the wrestler is facing. The wrestler then links their arms around the face-up opponent&#x27;s torso and presses down, squeezing the opponent&#x27;s spine against the wrestler&#x27;s shoulder. Hulk Hogan used this hold as a finisher earlier in career after the Bearhug and before his &quot;Atomic Leg Drop&quot;. A common variant of this hold has the attacking wrestler also apply a double underhook before or after lifting the opponent. This was used by Colt Cabana as the &quot;Colt .45&quot;. The double underhook variant is often seen when the hold is used to transition to another maneuver, such as a backbreaker drop or inverted powerbomb. Bruno Sammartino famously used this move on his opponents. Will Ospreay used the double underhook to spin his opponent into a neckbreaker called the &quot;Stormbreaker&quot;.

===Leglocks===
====Toehold====

Also known as &quot;Ashi-Dori-Garami&quot; in Judo, the wrestler sees the opponent in a crouching position and then takes hold of their foot and cranks it sideways, putting pressure on the ankle and achilles tendon. This move was innovated by Frank Gotch. A common type of toe hold is the &quot;figure-four toe hold&quot;, where a figure-four hold is used to hold the opponent&#x27;s foot. This type of toe hold is performed by holding the foot by the toes with one hand and putting the other hand under the opponent&#x27;s achilles tendon and grabbing the wrist. By controlling the opponent&#x27;s body and using the hands to plantar flex the foot either straight or slightly sideways, hence putting considerable torque on the ankle. A standing version of this move also exists which was innovated by Ken Shamrock, this is known as an &quot;Ankle Lock.&quot; Both of these maneuvers are also used in other various martial arts such as Judo, Submission Wrestling, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

====Ankle lock====

In this toe hold maneuver, a wrestler will grab the opponent&#x27;s foot and lift their leg off the ground. With one hand, the wrestler will grab either the toes or the outside of the foot, then with the other wrap the ankle to create a &quot;hole&quot; for the joint. A grapevine variation sees the wrestler applying the ankle lock hold and then falling to the mat and scissoring the leg of the opponent. This stops the opponent from rolling out of the move and makes it harder for them to crawl to the ropes, but lessens the pressure that can be applied. The move can be executed from a kneeling position or a standing position, depending on the wrestler&#x27;s preference. Ken Shamrock was the first to popularize the use of this move in professional wrestling, doing his from a kneeling position. Years later, Kurt Angle adopted the ankle lock as his finisher, but would often do it from a standing position. This is also performed by Jake Hager and Chad Gable, the former calling the move the &quot;Patriot Lock&quot; during his tenure in WWE as the &quot;Real American&quot; Jack Swagger.

Heel hook

A heel hook is a leg lock affecting multiple joints, and is applied by transversely twisting the foot either medially or laterally. There are several variations of heel hooks, with the most typical being performed by placing the legs around a leg of an opponent and holding the opponent&#x27;s foot in the armpit on the same side. The legs are used to control the movement of the opponent&#x27;s body while the opponent&#x27;s foot is twisted by holding the heel with the forearm and using the whole body to generate a twisting motion, hence creating severe medial torque on the ankle. A similar heel hook can be performed by holding the opponent&#x27;s foot in the opposite armpit and twisting it laterally; a move which is referred to as an inverted, reverse or inside heel hook. This was Michelle McCool&#x27;s submission finisher.

====Cloverleaf====

Also popularly known as a &quot;Texas Cloverleaf&quot;, the wrestler stands at the feet of the supine opponent, grabs the opponent&#x27;s legs, and lifts them up. The wrestler then bends one leg so that the shin is behind the knee of the straight leg and places the ankle of the straight leg in their armpit. With the same arm, they reach around the ankle and through the opening formed by the legs and lock their hands together. The wrestler then steps over their opponent, turning the opponent over as in a sharpshooter and Boston crab and proceeds to squat and lean back. The hold compresses the legs, flexes the spine, and stretches the abdomen. The move was invented by Dory Funk, Jr. Who invented the Texas Cloverleaf?&lt;/ref&gt; and popularized by Dean Malenko. A variation of the cloverleaf performed by Eddie Guerrero saw the wrestler perform the maneuver from a standing position, which enabled him to pull the opponent&#x27;s legs up high enough to where he could add pressure to the hold by sticking one of his knees into the other wrestler&#x27;s back. Guerrero referred to the move as the &quot;Lasso from El Paso&quot;, making reference to his hometown of El Paso, TX. Sheamus and JD McDonagh also use this move.

=====Cloverleaf with armlock=====
An armlock variation of the cloverleaf that is similar to a single leg Boston crab with armlock. This hold begins with an opponent lying face up on the mat. The attacking wrestler then seizes one of their arms and proceeds to walk over the opponent while continuing to hold the arm, forcing the opponent to turn over onto their stomach. The wrestler then kneels down on the opponent&#x27;s back, locking the opponent&#x27;s arm behind their knee in the process. The wrestler then reaches over and bends one leg so that the shin is behind the knee of the straight leg and places the ankle of the straight leg in their armpit. With the same arm, the wrestler reaches around the ankle and through the opening formed by the legs and locks their hands together as in a cloverleaf. The wrestler then pulls back so as to stretch the legs, back, and neck of the opponent while keeping the arm trapped.

=====Inverted cloverleaf=====
In this variation of a cloverleaf instead of turning around when turning the opponent over, the wrestler faces the same direction as the opponent to squat and lean forward to apply more pressure to the legs, spine, and abdomen. Also known as the Gorilla Clutch, named for Shuji Kondo&#x27;s King Kong-themed signature move names. A body scissors version exists as well. Rhea Ripley uses a standing version of this maneuver called the &quot;Prism Lock&quot;.

=====Leglock cloverleaf=====
This variation of the cloverleaf sees the wrestler, after crossing one of the opponent&#x27;s legs over the other in a figure four shape, lock the over leg behind their near knee before placing the straight leg under their armpit and turning over. The wrestler proceeds to lean back, pulling on the leg under the armpit. This keeps the over leg, now under, locked while putting pressure on the leg and stretching the legs and back. This variation is also used by Tyler Breeze as the &quot;Figure Four Sharpshooter&quot;, and by T. J. Perkins, who calls it the &quot;Figure Four Deathlock&quot;.

=====Rivera cloverleaf=====

, this variation of the cloverleaf sees the wrestler hook the legs like a cloverleaf, but then weaves their hands through to clasp their other hand and also hooks the ankle sticking out with one leg (left or right) into their kneepit.

====Cross kneelock====

Also called a straight legbar or kneebar, it is performed similarly to an armbar by holding the opponent&#x27;s leg in between the legs and arms so the opponent&#x27;s kneecap points towards the body. The wrestler pushes the hips forward, the opponent&#x27;s leg is straightened, and further leveraging hyper-extends the opponent&#x27;s knee. Commonly used as a counter to an attack from behind. The wrestler flips forward down on to their back, placing their legs around one of the legs of the opponent on the way down, and thus using their momentum to drop the opponent forward down to the mat. The move can be also applied by running towards the opponent and then performing the flip when next to them. This move is currently being used by NXT superstar Noam Dar calling it the &quot;Superkneebar 11&quot;, which was formerly known as the &quot;Champagne Superkneebar&quot;.

====Calf crusher====

Also known as a calf slicer or leg slicer, the calf crusher is a Compression lock that involves pressing the calf and/or thigh muscle into one of the bones in the leg. Similarly to the biceps slicer, a calf crusher can be applied by inserting an arm or leg in the backside of the knee and flexing the opponent&#x27;s leg to apply pressure to the muscles surrounding the fulcrum. Generally, the direction of the shin in the leg acting as a fulcrum will determine where the larger part of the pressure will go. Such calf crushers can be used as effective leglocks to the knee through a separating and elongating motion. Similarly to the Bicep slicer, the calf slicer is listed as a banned technique in the lower levels of some major Brazilian jiu-jitsu competitions. Wrestler AJ Styles uses this as a submission finisher move, calling it the &quot;Calf Killer&quot; in New Japan Pro-Wrestling and Impact Wrestling and the &quot;Calf Crusher&quot; in WWE.

====Damascus head and leglock====
The wrestler forces the opponent to the ground and opens up the opponent&#x27;s legs, stepping in with both legs. The wrestler then wraps their legs around the head of the opponent and crosses the opponent&#x27;s legs, applying pressure on them with their hands. The wrestler next turns 180 degrees and leans back. This hold applies pressure on the opponent&#x27;s temples and calves and compresses the spine.

====Figure-four leglock====
The wrestler stands over the opponent who is lying on the mat face up and grasps a leg of the opponent. The wrestler then does a spinning toe hold and grasps the other leg, crossing them into a &quot;4&quot; (hence the name), and falls to the mat, applying pressure to the opponent&#x27;s crossed legs with their own. While the hold applies pressure to the knee, it actually can be very painful to the shin of the victim. While the move is primarily a submission move, if the opponent has their shoulders on the mat, the referee can make a three count for a pinfall. If the referee is distracted, heel wrestlers may grab onto the ropes while executing the move to gain leverage and inflict more pain. This variation is the most famous version, invented by Buddy Rogers and popularized by Ric Flair, and is also the finisher of choice for several wrestlers like Greg &quot;The Hammer&quot; Valentine, &quot;The American Dream&quot; Dusty Rhodes, The Miz, AJ Styles, Jeff Jarrett, Tito Santana, Jack Brisco, Gerald Brisco, and The Silent Warrior. A modified variation exists more recently used by Shawn Michaels where the wrestler takes one of the opponent&#x27;s legs, turns 90 degrees, then grabs the opponent&#x27;s other leg and crosses it with the other, puts one foot in between and the other on the other leg, and then bridges over. With enough strength and willpower, the wrestler on defense can flip over onto their belly (and also their opponent), which is said to reverse the pressure onto the one who initially had the hold locked in. This counter to the figure-four is often called a &quot;modified Indian deathlock&quot; or sometimes referred to as a &quot;sharpshooter variant&quot;. Charlotte Flair uses a bridging variation of the move referred to as a Figure Eight. For a figure eight, the wrestler will then push up into a bridge. This move can be compared to the Heel Hook in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

On the Steve Austin Show Unleashed Podcast, George Scott was credited by Ric Flair as the person who came up with the idea that to reverse the figure-four leglock, the opponent would simply turn over onto their stomach.

=====Haas of Pain=====
This modified inverted reverse figure-four leglock variation sees the wrestler cross one leg of an opponent over them and stand on the crossed leg, then take hold of the free leg and lay down on their back, raising the opponent&#x27;s legs up into the air and causing pain to their legs and lower back. The name is derived from Charlie and Russ, the Haas Brothers, who invented this move. This move is the finisher of Charlie Haas.

=====Inverted figure-four ankle lock=====
This submission hold involves a combination of the figure-four leglock and the ankle lock. However, instead of locking the opponent&#x27;s legs in a &quot;4&quot; shape, the attacking wrestler crosses one of the opponent&#x27;s legs over to the other leg. Then the attacking wrestler grapevines the other leg, turns their body in the direction of the crossed leg forcing the opponent onto their side to immobilize the leg at the foot on the mat to create pressure and performs an ankle lock submission hold. The late Eddie Guerrero used this move, sometimes transitioning from a headscissors takedown which sees him rolling backwards from the momentum over the supine opponent to end up at their legs to then apply the hold. He called this move the &quot;Lasso from El Paso&quot; and used the move until adopting an elevated cloverleaf as a finisher referring to it as the same name.

=====Kneeling figure-four leglock=====
Also known as a &quot;Prison Lock&quot;, the opponent is down on their back with the wrestler standing over one of their legs. The wrestler applies a spinning toehold, crosses the opponent&#x27;s legs and kneels on them.

=====Inverted figure-four leglock=====
This version is a variant which sees the opponent face up with the wrestler grabbing the opponent&#x27;s legs, putting their own leg through, and twisting them as if doing a sharpshooter, but instead putting their other leg on the opponent&#x27;s nearest foot, dropping down to the mat and applying pressure. Shawn Michaels popularized this move during his wrestling career.

=====Ringpost figure-four leglock=====
Sometimes called a &quot;flying figure-four&quot;, the opponent is either downed or standing next to one of the ring corner posts. The wrestler exits the ring to the outside and drags the opponent by the legs towards the ring post, so that the post is between the opponent&#x27;s legs (similar to when somebody &#x27;crotches&#x27; their opponent with the ringpost). The executor then stands next to the ring apron, on the outside of the turnbuckle or ropes and applies the figure four leglock with the ring post between the opponent&#x27;s legs. The performer of the hold then falls back while grabbing the opponent&#x27;s legs or feet, hanging upside down from the ring apron. The ring post assists the move, creating more damage and leverage to the opponent&#x27;s knee. This is an illegal hold as it both involves the attacker performing the move whilst outside the ring as well as using part of the ring (the ringpost) to execute the move. The move was invented by Bret Hart and was used by Diamond Dallas Page and Gail Kim.

=====Standing figure-four leglock=====
The opponent is down on their back with the wrestler standing over one of their legs with one foot placed on either side of the leg. The wrestler plants their foot in the knee of the opponent&#x27;s other leg and then bends that leg at the knee over the top of the first leg, forming the figure four. The wrestler then bridges back. Steve Austin used this move during his WCW career while under his &quot;Hollywood&quot; gimmick, dubbing it &quot;Hollywood &amp; Vine&quot;.

=====Trailer hitch=====
Popularized by Jamie Noble, the opponent starts on their stomach with the attacker crossing one leg over the knee-pit of the other and holding that bent leg down by dropping to their side and placing their leg over it (passing that leg through the hole of the &quot;4&quot;. The wrestler uses their foot to push the opponent&#x27;s straight leg backwards and over the bent leg&#x27;s ankle.

=====Heel hook=====

This hold is performed by placing the legs around a leg of an opponent and holding the opponent&#x27;s foot in the armpit on the same side. The legs are used to control the movement of the opponent&#x27;s body while the opponent&#x27;s foot is twisted by holding the heel with the forearm and using the whole body to generate a twisting motion, hence creating severe medial torque on the ankle. This move can also be compared to the Figure-four leglock. This move has been used by Daniel Bryan and Bobby Fish as the &quot;Fish Hook Deluxe Edition&quot;. This move has been used in several other martial arts and is banned in most competitions due to the high risk of injury from this move.

====Indian deathlock====

Innovated by Chief Little Wolf, the wrestler lifts up a leg of a face-up opponent and wraps one of their legs around the other leg before dropping to a kneeling position, thus locking the opponent&#x27;s leg behind the wrestler&#x27;s knee. The wrestler then reaches over and grabs the opponent&#x27;s far leg and places it on top of the trapped foot of the opponent. The wrestler then performs a forward roll while maintaining the hold. This forces the opponent onto their chest while the wrestler ends in a sitting position facing the same direction as their opponent. From here the wrestler can reach forward and perform many upper body submissions as well. A lot of superstars who used Native American gimmicks also used this as a finisher, such as Chief Jay Strongbow, Billy White Wolf, Wahoo McDaniel, and Jules Strongbow. 

A standing version can also be applied, which sees a standing wrestler place one of their legs between the legs of a face-down opponent and then bend one leg behind the leg of the wrestler, placing it on top of the knee pit of the opponent&#x27;s other leg. The wrestler then picks up the straight leg of the opponent, bends it backwards to lock the other leg in the knee pit and places the foot in front of the shin of the standing leg in the knee pit, thus locking the leg.

=====Inverted Indian deathlock=====
With the opponent on their back, the wrestler, standing beside them, sits with their leg over and between the opponent&#x27;s legs (often using a legdrop to the knee). The wrestler then places the opponent&#x27;s far leg in the knee-pit of the near leg, finishing the submission by putting the opponent&#x27;s ankle on top of their own ankle, rolling both onto their bellies, and pushing back with the wrestler&#x27;s knees. This move has been famously used by Triple H in the WCW. It is used by Cody Rhodes as the &quot;American Nightmare&quot;.

====Sharpshooter====

Also (and originally) known as a &quot;scorpion hold&quot;. This move is usually executed on a wrestler lying flat on their back. The wrestler executing the move will step between the opponent&#x27;s legs, grab both of them, and twist them into a knot around their leg. Holding the opponent&#x27;s legs in place, the wrestler then steps over the opponent and turns them over, applying pressure the whole way to cause pain to the knee and legs. While applying the pressure to the legs, the wrestler executing the move has a variety of positions they can be in; however, the two most common involve the wrestler standing and leaning back while applying the move or sitting on their opponent&#x27;s back. The move was invented by Riki Choshu but was made famous in the United States by Bret &quot;Hitman&quot; Hart, who gave it the name &quot;Sharpshooter&quot; to suit his stage name. The move was first popularized in the States by Sting, who called the hold the &quot;Scorpion Death Lock&quot; and applied the hold from a seated position. The only difference between Sting&#x27;s &quot;Scorpion Death Lock&quot; and the &quot;Sharpshooter&quot; is upon which leg the pressure is applied, as Sting&#x27;s targets the right leg and the &quot;Sharpshooter&quot; targets the left leg. Evil uses a variation called &quot;Darkness Scorpion&quot;, where the move is preceded by a stomp into the groin area. It is currently used by current WWE wrestler Natalya Neidhart as a finisher. Famous Luchador Blue Demon Jr. also uses a modified variant of this move as well, in which he does an inverted sharpshooter and then uses his free arm to pull back his opponent&#x27;s arm.

====Inverted Sharpshooter====
For this variation, the wrestler steps between the opponent&#x27;s legs with one of their own and crosses the opponent&#x27;s legs so that their near leg&#x27;s ankle is in the far leg&#x27;s knee pit. The wrestler then does not mount the opponent, but instead remains to the side of the opponent and pushes to cause pain. The Rated R Superstar, Edge used this variation, calling it the &quot;Edgecator&quot;.

====Spinning toe hold====
Used by Terry Funk and Dory Funk Jr., the wrestler using this move stands over the opponent who is lying face up on the mat and grasps a leg of the opponent. The wrestler then turns 360 degrees over the leg, twisting it inward. A wrestler can repeatedly step over the leg and around again to twist the knee and ankle joints even more. This can also be used as a setup move for leg locks such as the &quot;Figure 4 Leglock&quot; and the &quot;Indian Deathlock&quot;.

==Chokes==
===Anaconda vise===

The anaconda vise is a compression choke. The wrestler wraps their arms around the head and one arm of the opponent and squeezes, choking the opponent. It is considered legal in professional wrestling, although it is a chokehold. This submission hold was invented by Hiroyoshi Tenzan.

Also known as an arm-trap triangle choke. The vise is done from a position in which the wrestler and the opponent are seated on the mat facing each other. The wrestler sits on one side of the opponent, encircles the opponent in a headlock position using their near arm, and grabs the opponent&#x27;s near wrist, bending the arm upwards. Then, the wrestler maneuvers their other arm through the &quot;hole&quot; created by the opponent&#x27;s bent wrist, locks their hand upon their own wrist, and pulls the opponent forward, causing pressure on the opponent&#x27;s arm and neck. CM Punk popularized the usage of this move. 

There are also variations of the anaconda vise that are combined with a single arm straight jacket choke called an &quot;Anaconda Max&quot; and a cobra clutch called an &quot;Anaconda Cross&quot;. These variations are also invented and used by Tenzan himself.

===Arm triangle choke===

Also called an arm triangle, this choke sees the wrestler wrapping their arm from under the opponent&#x27;s nearest arm(pit) and across the chest. The maneuver can be used as an uncommon submission maneuver, such as used by Braun Strowman, or a transitioning hold, usually to fall backwards into an arm triangle reverse STO. Austin Aries uses a bridging variation called &quot;Last Chancery&quot; as one of his finishing moves. Dexter Lumis uses this move called &quot;Silence&quot;, which sees him use the move from either a standing and seated position, with the latter sometimes transitioning from a sitout sideslam.

===Bulldog choke===

Also known as a &quot;Bulldog headlock&quot; in BJJ, the wrestler, like a guillotine choke, tucks the other wrestlers head under their armpit. But unlike the standard guillotine choke, the wrestler tucks the other wrestler&#x27;s head so that the face the opposite direction of a guillotine choke. Mainly used as a setup for the bulldog, this move has been used commonly in MMA and other sports. Often at times, this move can be confused with a side headlock. AEW wrestler Jon Moxley uses this move as a finisher sometimes while transitioning into it from already having applied a sleeper hold or rear naked choke using either move to take the opponent down.

===Corner foot choke===

The wrestler pushes their standing or seated opponent into the turnbuckle and extends their leg, choking their opponent while using the top two ropes for support. This attack is illegal and results in a wrestler&#x27;s disqualification, should the move not be broken by a count of five. William Regal used a variation where he would face the opposite direction while distracting the referee, allowing him to maintain the choke for a prolonged period of time. 

For some flexible wrestlers, a variation of this move can be performed while standing in the performance of a standing split. Another variant performed by Dana Brooke is done in a handstand position while she chokes the opponent with one foot.

===Double choke===
The wrestler grabs their opponent&#x27;s throat with both hands and throttles them. A chokelift can be used as well if the wrestler were to perform a chokebomb or a two-handed chokeslam.

===Figure-four necklock/headlock===
This neck lock sees a wrestler sit above a fallen opponent and wrap their legs around the opponent in the form of the figure-four, with one leg crossing under the opponent&#x27;s chin and under the wrestler&#x27;s other leg the wrestler squeezes and chokes the opponent. In an illegal version of the hold, best described as a hanging figure-four necklock, the wrestler stands on top of the turnbuckle, wraps their legs around the head of the opponent (who has their back turned against the turnbuckle) in the figure-four and falls backwards, choking the opponent. In most matches the hold would have to be released before a five count. This move was popularized by former WWE Wrestler Candice Michelle. WWE wrestler Carmella uses an inverted variant of this hold as her finisher where she uses her shin to choke the opponent instead, making it resemble a gogoplata. This variant is called the &quot;Code of Silence&quot;.

===Gogoplata===
Usually executed from a &quot;rubber guard,&quot; where the legs are held very high, against the opponent&#x27;s upper back. The wrestler then slips one foot in front of the opponent&#x27;s head and under their chin, locks their hands behind the opponent&#x27;s head, and chokes the opponent by pressing their shin or instep against the opponent&#x27;s trachea. Wrestlers use a modified version, where they only push the shin into the throat in exactly the same manner (instead of grabbing their toes and pulling towards themselves). The Undertaker used this as his submission finisher, calling it &quot;Hell&#x27;s Gate&quot;. Tyson Kidd uses a variation where he laces his opponent&#x27;s legs as if he was to perform a Sharpshooter, but then falls to his back, and then locks in the Gogoplata. He names this move, the &quot;Hart Lock.&quot;

===Guillotine choke===
The wrestler faces their opponent, who is bent over. The attacking wrestler tucks the opponent&#x27;s head underneath their armpit and wraps one arm around the neck so that the forearm is pressed against the throat, as in a front chancery. The attacking wrestler then wraps their legs around the opponent&#x27;s midsection with a body scissors and arches backwards, pulling the opponent&#x27;s head forward, stretching the torso and the neck. It can be performed from standing, sitting, or prone positions. This move is also sometimes dubbed the &quot;King Crab Lock&quot;. This move is most recently used by Roman Reigns in his &quot;Tribal Chief&quot; character. Liv Morgan used this move as her finisher by transitioning it into a DDT in her early days in WWE&#x27;s developmental territory NXT from 2014 to 2017.

===Half nelson choke===

Also known as a cobra choke or a &quot;kata ha jime&quot; (a term borrowed from judo), this hold sees the wrestler put the opponent in a half nelson with one arm and grab the opponent&#x27;s neck with the other, sometimes while adding body scissors. The move was popularized by Taz, who used it as a finishing move, calling it the &quot;Tazmission&quot;. His son, AEW wrestler Hook, also adopted it as his finishing maneuver, rebranding it as &quot;Redrum&quot;.

===Hart lock/Dungeon lock===
Essentially a Gogoplata with leg submission, the wrestler steps over their opponent&#x27;s leg and then laces the opponent&#x27;s legs together, as a standard Sharpshooter would be performed. But instead of taking a big step forward to lock in the Sharpshooter submission, the wrestler falls to their back and then catches the opponent&#x27;s throat with their shinbone, as if to perform a Gogoplata. Tyson Kidd formerly used this move.

===Koji clutch===
The opponent lies face down on the mat. The wrestler lies face up and slightly to the side of the opponent. The wrestler hooks their far leg across the neck of the opponent, then hooks their hands behind the opponent&#x27;s head, having one arm pass over their own leg and the other under. The wrestler then pulls backwards with their arms and pushes forward with their leg, causing pressure. The name comes from its inventor&#x27;s name, Koji Kanemoto. This move is commonly transitioned from a reverse STO. Another variation sees the attacker performing a reverse STO, then locking the regular Koji clutch in, but crossing their legs in a modified figure-four headscissors. Sami Zayn formerly used this move during his time in NXT.

===Leg choke===
With the opponent hung over the second rope, facing the outside of the ring, the attacking wrestler hooks their left or right leg over the back of the opponent&#x27;s neck. The attacking wrestler then pulls the second rope upwards, compressing the opponent&#x27;s throat between the rope and attacking wrestler&#x27;s leg, choking them. This move is illegal due to usage of the ring ropes, and results in a disqualification for the wrestler should they not release the hold before a count of five.

===Pentagram choke===
In this variation of the triangle choke, the wrestler sits behind a seated opponent. The wrestler places one of their legs under the chin of the opponent and pushes up. The wrestler then takes hold of their ankle with their opposite arm and pulls their leg up. The wrestler then places their free leg on the instep of the leg which is already being used to choke the opponent. The wrestler finally takes their free arm, hooks the opponent&#x27;s arm which is in the vise, and holds their opposite leg from the knee. The pressure is applied once the wrestler compresses their knees together. The pentagram choke creates a complete vise around the opponent&#x27;s neck, and its name comes from using five sides, whereas the triangle choke only uses three.

===Single arm choke===
The wrestler grabs their opponent&#x27;s throat with one hand and squeezes tightly. A &quot;goozle&quot; is a single arm choke held briefly before performing a chokeslam.

===Sleeper hold===
Innovated by Ed Lewis, the wrestler begins positioned behind their opponent. The wrestler then wraps their arm around the opponent&#x27;s neck, pressing the biceps against one side of the neck and the inner bone of the forearm against the other side. The neck is squeezed inside the arm very tightly. Additional pressure can be applied by grabbing the left shoulder with the right hand, or grabbing the biceps of the left arm near the elbow, then using the left hand to push the opponent&#x27;s head towards the crook of the right elbow. Popularized by Brutus Beefcake, Waylon Mercy, Dolph Ziggler, Minoru Suzuki, and most recognized with Roddy Piper. This move is also being used by indie wrestler The Silent Warrior, a wrestler who is Deaf. 

====Arm-hook sleeper====
Also known as a &quot;buffalo sleeper&quot;, this choke sees the wrestler kneeling behind a seated opponent before grabbing hold of one of the opponent&#x27;s arms, bending it backwards overhead, and locking the opponent&#x27;s wrist into the attacker&#x27;s armpit. The wrestler then wraps their free arm under the opponent&#x27;s chin as in a sleeper hold, puts their other arm through the arch created by the opponent&#x27;s trapped arm, and locks their hands. The wrestler then squeezes the opponent&#x27;s neck, causing pressure. The move was invented by Hiroyoshi Tenzan.

====Cobra clutch====

Also known as an &quot;arm-trap half nelson sleeper&quot;, the wrestler stands behind the opponent and uses one arm to place the opponent in a half nelson. The wrestler then uses their free arm to pull the opponent&#x27;s arm (the same arm to which the wrestler is applying the half nelson) across the face of the opponent. The wrestler then locks their hand to their wrist behind the opponent&#x27;s neck to make the opponent submit or lose consciousness as the carotid artery is cut off. 

This submission has been used as a &quot;finishing&quot; maneuver by a number of wrestlers over the years, including Sgt. Slaughter and Jim &quot;The Anvil&quot; Neidhart, who called it the &quot;Anvilizer&quot;; Ted DiBiase Sr., Ted DiBiase Jr., and The Ringmaster, who called it the &quot;Million Dollar Dream&quot;; and Kazuchika Okada, who calls it the &quot;Money Clip.&quot;

====Bridging cobra clutch====
With the opponent lying face down, the wrestler sits beside the opponent, facing the same way, locks on the cobra clutch, and then arches their legs and back, bending the opponent&#x27;s torso and neck upwards. Used by Delirious.

====Dragon sleeper====
The attacking wrestler stands behind the opponent who is either sitting or lying face down, then pulls the opponent into an inverted facelock, often hooking the opponent&#x27;s near arm with their free arm. The attacker then pulls backwards and up, wrenching the opponent&#x27;s neck and spine. If the opponent is sitting, the wrestler can press their knee into the opponent&#x27;s back, adding pressure. Invented by Tatsumi Fujinami and popularized in the United States by Último Dragón. A standing variation of this move was used by The Undertaker, who called it &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot;. Low Ki once used a version from a back-mount position called the &quot;Dragon Clutch&quot;. Sanada used this hold while applying with bodyscissors as the &quot;Skull End&quot;. Drew Gulak uses a kneeling variation of the submission called the &quot;Gu-Lock&quot;. Malakai Black uses a variation where he reaches behind his back and clamps his hands together, he names the move, &quot;Dark Ritual&quot;.

====Hangman&#x27;s choke====
The wrestler wraps their arm around the opponent&#x27;s neck performing a sleeper hold, then climbs to the second rope and hangs the opponent by the neck. This move is illegal due to usage of the ring ropes, and results in a disqualification for the wrestler should they not release the hold before a count of five.

====Rear naked choke====

A grounded version of a sleeper hold with an added body scissors that is derived from martial arts and more recently mixed martial arts. AEW and ROH wrestler Samoa Joe uses this as his signature submission hold, calling it the &quot;Coquina Clutch,&quot; and current WWE wrestler Shayna Baszler uses it as her finisher, calling it the &quot;Kirifuda Clutch.&quot; A variation, called a bar-arm sleeper is where one applies a normal sleeper to the opponent and uses the opposite arm close to their face as added pressure applied to the move. This variation is used by Karrion Kross and it is called the &quot;Kross Jacket.&quot;

====Spider twist====
Also known as a headscissors crucifix choke, the opponent is sitting while the wrestler is behind the opponent holding the opponent&#x27;s wrist. The wrestler will apply an armscissor with one leg and a headscissors. then the wrestler clasps their hand, one arm passes through the leg applying the headscissors and the other goes under. The wrestler pulls upwards while their leg goes downwards, applying pressure to the shoulders, head and back. Innovated by Mariko Yoshida, it is currently used by Naomi, naming it &quot;Feel the Glow&quot;, formerly known as &quot;Starstruck&quot; during her run in Impact Wrestling.

===Straight jacket===
Also known as a &quot;Japanese stranglehold&quot; (&quot;goku-raku gatame&quot;), &quot;criss-cross stranglehold&quot;, &quot;cut-throat&quot;, and &quot;cross-armed choke&quot;. The wrestler sits on the back of an opponent who is lying face down on the mat. The wrestler then grabs hold of the opponent&#x27;s wrists and crosses their arms under their chin. The wrestler then pulls back on the arms, causing pressure. The move was invented and popularized by Jinsei Shinzaki. 

The hold can also be applied while standing with the opponent&#x27;s arms crossed across their chest or stomach held by the attacker to transition into other moves such as a suplex or an iconoclasm.

===Thumb choke hold===
The attacking wrestler stands behind an opponent and reaches around the opponent&#x27;s neck with one arm. The wrestler then extends a thumb and thrusts it into the windpipe or carotid artery of the opponent, cutting off their air or blood supply. The former would not be acceptable in traditional professional wrestling, as all chokeholds that cut off the windpipe are not allowed in the sport. This was famously used by Don Muraco as the &quot;Asiatic Spike&quot; and Terry Gordy (which he learned from Killer Khan) as the &quot;Oriental Spike&quot;.

===Tongan death grip===
The wrestler darts their hand under an opponent&#x27;s chin and grabs ahold of a pressure point above the throat, squeezing the nerve. This cuts off the air supply and the opponent fades out, yet this is not considered an air choke as it is not squeezing the windpipe. This hold is unique in that it can be used as a sleeper-like submission or, should the &quot;unconscious&quot; opponent end up lying on their back, a pinfall. Used as a finisher by Haku and Bone Soldier. This move was used by former NWA superstar Tyrus, previously known as the &quot;G-Grip&quot; which saw him transition the move into an STO during his stint in the WWE, and his recent version the &quot;T-Slam&quot; transitioning the move into a chokeslam.

===Triangle choke===

The wrestler grabs hold of one of their opponent&#x27;s arms, wraps their legs around the opponent&#x27;s throat and arm in a figure-four and squeezes. Different promotions have different rules regarding the legality of this maneuver. The justification for its legality is that, like a head scissors, it uses the legs rather than the hands to perform the &quot;choke&quot;; also, it does not crush the windpipe (strangulation); rather, it compresses the carotid arteries (jugulation). This move is used by Shane McMahon and CM Punk.

=== Two handed chokelift ===
The wrestler grasps an opponent&#x27;s neck with both hands then lifts them up. This is a transition hold for moves such as a two-handed chokeslam and a chokebomb.

==Transition holds==
Some holds are meant neither to pin an opponent, nor weaken them nor force them to submit, but are intended to set up the opponent for another attack.

===Arm wrench===
The wrestler takes hold of the opponent&#x27;s arm or wrist and turns around completely while twisting the arm over the wrestler&#x27;s head, resulting in the opponent&#x27;s arm being wrenched. This may lead to an armbar, a wrist lock, the wrestler pulling the opponent onto their shoulders in a fireman&#x27;s carry, an Irish whip, or a short-arm maneuver, such as a clothesline.

===Butterfly===

Also referred to as a reverse nelson and double underhook. The wrestler and the opponent begin facing one another, with the opponent bent over. The wrestler approaches the opponent and reaches under the opponent&#x27;s shoulders, then threads their arms up and around the opponent&#x27;s torso, with their hands meeting in the middle of the opponent&#x27;s back or neck (essentially an inverted full nelson hold), and tucking the opponents head in their armpit. The hold itself can be and sometimes is used as a submission move, but it is more commonly used as a transition hold to set up another move such as a suplex, a DDT, a facebuster, or a powerbomb. One wrestler who does use the move as a submission is Matt Hardy; his &quot;Ice Pick&quot; maneuver sees him lock the double underhook on an opponent while simultaneously trapping the opponent in a bodyscissors lock.

==== Single underhook ====
Similar to a double underhook, but only one arm is underhooked and the head of the opponent is placed into a front facelock. It can be transitioned into a DDT, suplex, etc. Used by Yoshi-Hashi as &quot;Butterfly Lock&quot;.

===Corner-trap===
The wrestler takes hold of an opponent that&#x27;s standing on either of the ropes in the corner and pulls them down into a bent over position to trap their head with the top turnbuckle. It is used by Will Osprey as a way to set up his &quot;Cheeky Nandos Kick&quot;.

===Crucifix===
The wrestler stands in front of and facing a bent over opponent and places them in a gutwrench waistlock or a standing headscissors. The wrestler then flips the opponent up and over so the opponent is lying face up on the back of the wrestler. The wrestler then moves their hands to the upper arm or wrists of the opponent, holding them in position, and spreading the arms of the opponent as though they were being crucified, hence the name. This is often a set-up for a crucifix powerbomb or a spinning crucifix toss.

====Reverse crucifix====
The wrestler stands in front of and with their back to a standing opponent. The wrestler then leans backwards and seizes the opponent around the waist, pulling them forward and upwards so they are lying across the shoulder of the opponent, facing downwards. The wrestler then takes hold of the upper arms or wrists of the opponent and spreads them, holding the opponent in place.

===Deadlift===
This transition refers to any instance of a wrestler lifting the opponent from the ground to transition to a bigger move. Examples of this are when a wrestler performs a gutwrench lift to an opponent laying down on to execute a gutwrench suplex or a gutwrench powerbomb, or when a wrestler performs a schoolboy powerbomb.

===Electric chair===
A transitional hold in which an attacking wrestler hoists an opponent up onto their shoulders so that they are both facing in the same direction. It is often used to set up various drops and slams in singles competition. However it is more often used in a double team maneuver, known as a &quot;doomsday device&quot;, wherein another wrestler uses flying attacks to knock opponents off the shoulders of the wrestler. Like many transition holds, the defensive wrestler often uses the position to perform a variety of counter moves, most notably the victory roll. Another counter of the electric chair position is the wrestler twisting over the opponent&#x27;s shoulders so now they are facing the opposite direction, and from that position, the wrestler would backflip to hit a hurricanrana. 

In Mexico&#x27;s Lucha libre this hold is known as &quot;La Torre&quot;, Spanish for &quot;The Tower&quot;. Lucha&#x27;s &quot;Electric chair&quot; (&quot;Silla Eléctrica&quot; in Spanish) is the term used for two different, unrelated attacks. The atomic drop is the &quot;common&quot; version of the move, and the &quot;Inverted Electric chair&quot; (&quot;Silla Eléctrica invertida&quot; in Spanish) sets the attacking wrestler running towards a seated opponent both facing forward, then leaping and falling into a seated senton on the opponent&#x27;s nape and shoulders.

===Fireman&#x27;s carry===

The wrestler bends over with the opponent standing to the side of the wrestler. The wrestler then pulls the opponent&#x27;s arm over their far shoulder and distributes the wrestler&#x27;s body over their shoulders while having the other hand between and holding onto one of the opponent&#x27;s legs and stands up. The opponent is draped face-down across the wrestler&#x27;s shoulders, with the wrestler&#x27;s arms wrapped around from behind. It is a key component of several throws, drops and slams.

===Float over===
The wrestler stands face-to-face with the opponent, ducks, hooks one of their arms over the opponent&#x27;s shoulder (if seizing the opponent&#x27;s left shoulder, they hook with their right, or opposite if sides are reversed), swings under the opponent&#x27;s armpit, then around and over the opponent&#x27;s back, so that it faces the same way as the opponent.

===Gorilla press===
Also known as &quot;Military press&quot;. A transition lift to perform many throws, drops and slams. It became a popular technique for larger and stronger wrestlers as the lift is seen to emphasize their height and power. It is mostly used by Mark Henry, Goldberg, Beth Phoenix, Ric Flair, Sting, Kurt Angle, Jason Jordan, and Nia Jax. It is innovated by the late great Gorilla Monsoon.

===Gutwrench===
A set-up for many throws and slams, this sees the attacking wrestler put a bent at the waist opponent to one side of them, reach the near hand around, and lock their hands around the opponent&#x27;s waist. A common move out of this transition can be a powerbomb or a suplex.

===Lady of the lake===
The move used to trick an unsuspecting opponent. The wrestler sits down, crosses their legs, tucks their head into their chest and wraps one arm around their ankle (so they are effectively rolled into a ball). The wrestler then extends their remaining arm between their legs and then waits. The opponent, ostensibly confused, normally takes the offered hand, at which point the wrestler rolls forward and into an armlock. This was used by Johnny Saint as the &quot;Johnny Saint Special&quot;.

===Mount===

The wrestler sits on top of the opponent&#x27;s torso, facing their head, with their legs on either side. When the opponent&#x27;s head is facing the ground, the position is referred to as back mount. Various strikes, such as closed-fist punches, elbows, open-hand slaps, open-hand palm strikes, and hammer-fists to the opponent&#x27;s head are often performed from this position. Closed fist punches are legal in WWE, but in other promotions, referees will tell wrestlers to watch the hand due to closed-fist punches being illegal. Palm strikes, slaps, and elbow strikes can be used in place of punches.

===Pumphandle===
The wrestler stands behind their opponent and bends them forward. One of the opponent&#x27;s arms is pulled back between their legs and held, while the other arm is hooked. Then the wrestler lifts the opponent up over their shoulder. From here many throws, drops and slams can be performed. A double pumphandle exists, where the second arm is not hooked, it is also pulled under and between the opponent&#x27;s legs.

===Rope-hung===
A rope-hung move sees the opponent trapped either over the top rope or between the top and second rope. From that position, the wrestler could execute many moves while the opponent is hung over/between the rope(s), for example a DDT or a neckbreaker.

===Scoop===
Facing the opponent, the wrestler reaches between the opponent&#x27;s legs with one arm and reaches around their back from the same side with their other arm. The wrestler lifts their opponent up so they are horizontal across the wrestler&#x27;s body. From here many throws, drops and slams can be performed. The scoop is also called the scoop powerslam where the wrestler puts their hand in middle of the opponent&#x27;s legs and turns them.

===Stepover toehold===
The wrestler approaches the opponent who is lying face-down. The wrestler traps one of the opponent&#x27;s ankles between their thighs (as seen primarily before applying an STF). From that point, the wrestler can apply other holds to the opponent, such as a fujiwara armbar or a three-quarter facelock.

===Tilt-a-whirl===
The wrestler stands facing the opponent. The wrestler bends the opponent down so they are bent facing in front on the wrestler&#x27;s body. The wrestler reaches around the opponent&#x27;s body with their arms and lifts them up, spinning the opponent in front of the wrestler&#x27;s body, often to deliver a slam or most commonly a &quot;tilt-a-whirl backbreaker&quot; or a &quot;pendulum backbreaker&quot;. Usually performed on a charging opponent, this can also be a transition hold for counterattacks that sees the wrestler hit many throws and drops like a DDT or headscissors takedown.

===Wheelbarrow===
This move is achieved when a wrestler wraps a forward-facing opponent&#x27;s legs around their waist (either by standing behind an opponent who is lying face-first on the mat or by catching a charging opponent), applying a gutwrench hold and lifting the opponent up off the ground into the air, then either continuing lifting and falling backwards to wheelbarrow suplex, or forcing the opponent back down to the mat to hit a wheelbarrow facebuster. This can also be a transition hold for counterattacks that see the wrestler (who is being wheelbarrowed) hit many throws and drops, like a DDT or a bulldog and rolling pin combinations.

==Miscellaneous==
===Collar-and-elbow tie-up===

The collar-and-elbow tie-up is one of the mainstays of professional wrestling, and many matches are begun with this move. It is a neutral move, but it easily transitions for either wrestler to a position of dominance. It is performed by approaching the opponent and putting one hand on the back of the opponent&#x27;s neck while holding the elbow of the opponent&#x27;s arm that is holding their own neck. It can also be used to immobilize an opponent by pushing them to the ground.

===Giant swing===

The wrestler takes hold of a supine opponent&#x27;s legs and pivots rapidly, elevating the opponent and swinging the opponent in a circle. The wrestler may release the hold in mid-air or simply slow until the back of the opponent returns to the ground. This move is used by Cesaro as the &quot;Cesaro Swing&quot;.
===Hangman===
This evasive move is used when the wrestler drops down or moves out of the way against an oncoming opponent who then loses their footing. This causes their momentum to send them flying over the rope becoming trapped between the top and middle rope hanging by their neck as they hang on to the top rope for leverage. The move is very dangerous for the opponent as the sudden stop could cause them to break their neck if they don&#x27;t brace properly as well as the ring ropes can cut off air or blood supply if the ropes are wound too tight or are too thick as evident in a match between Cactus Jack and Vader during their feud.

===Sunset flip===

This move commonly sees an attacking wrestler dive over an opponent who is facing them, usually bent over forwards, catching the opponent in a waistlock from behind and landing back-first behind the opponent. From that position the wrestler rolls forward into a sitting position, pulling the opponent over backwards and down to the mat so that they land on their back into a sitout pin position. While being held on the shoulders of an attacking wrestler in a position where the opponent is straddling the head of the attacking wrestler while facing in the other direction. This move can be used as a counter from various powerbombs and other moves such as a Gory bomb. The move was used by Melina as the &quot;Last Call&quot;. Naomi uses this move to set up for the F.T.G submission manouvre.

===Tree of woe===
This involves a wrestler suspending an opponent upside down on a turnbuckle, with the opponent&#x27;s back being up against it. To do this, the opponent&#x27;s legs are then hooked under the top ropes, leaving the opponent facing the attacking wrestler, upside down. Often an attacking wrestler will choke, kick, or stomp the opponent until the referee uses up their five count. The technique is also used to trap an opponent while the attacking wrestler runs at them and delivers some form of offensive maneuver, such as a running knee attack or a baseball slide.

<text>Sheila McCarthy (born January 1, 1956) is a Canadian actress and singer. She has worked in film, television, and on stage. McCarthy is one of Canada&#x27;s most honoured actors, having won two Genie Awards (film), two Gemini Awards (television), an ACTRA Award, and two Dora Awards (theatre), along with multiple nominations.

== Early life ==
McCarthy was born in Toronto, Ontario on January 1, 1956. She attended Thornlea Secondary School in Thornhill in her youth. Her first appearance on stage was at Toronto&#x27;s Elgin Theatre in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; when she was age six. She later attended the University of Victoria and spent a year studying with Uta Hagen at her HB Studio in New York City, and also workshopped with the Second City troupe in Toronto.

== Career ==

After several years of television work under her belt, McCarthy secured a role in the made-for-television movie &quot;A Nest of Singing Birds&quot; (1987), receiving early recognition for her talent with a Gemini Award nomination for Best Performance by a Lead Actress in a Dramatic Program. That year, she made her first notable impression on the Canadian movie scene as Polly, the quirky, &quot;organizationally impaired girl&quot; in Patricia Rozema&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Heard the Mermaids Singing&quot;. For this role, McCarthy won the Genie Award for Best Actress. The film became wildly popular in Canada, earning many international and domestic awards and critical acclaim.

McCarthy has since become one of Canada&#x27;s more honoured actors, having won two Genie Awards (film), two Gemini Awards (television), and two Dora Awards (theatre) along with multiple nominations.

She played Sarah Hamoudi in the Canadian television series &quot;Little Mosque on the Prairie&quot; (2007–2012), a role for which she was nominated for a Gemini award. One of her more recognized big-screen roles is Samantha, the news reporter in the movie &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; with Bruce Willis. Her most recent roles are Connie Hendrix, mother of the clone Alison in series &quot;Orphan Black&quot; and Agnes Rofa in the series &quot;The Umbrella Academy&quot;.

She is also an accomplished voice-over actress, having performed characters voices in &quot;Free Willy&quot;, &quot;Mythic Warriors: Guardians of the Legend&quot;, &quot;The Busy World of Richard Scarry&quot;, &quot;The Neverending Story&quot;, &quot;Bad Dog&quot; and &quot;Marvin the Tap-Dancing Horse&quot;.

<doc id="474589" wikidata="Q1770333" url="?curid=474589" title="Ultra-high-energy cosmic ray">
<text>In astroparticle physics, an ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) is a cosmic ray with an energy greater than 1 EeV (1018 electronvolts, approximately 0.16 joules), far beyond both the rest mass and energies typical of other cosmic ray particles. The origin of these highest energy cosmic ray is not known.

These particles are extremely rare; between 2004 and 2007, the initial runs of the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) detected 27 events with estimated arrival energies above , that is, about one such event every four weeks in the area surveyed by the observatory.
==Observational history==

The first observation of a cosmic ray particle with an energy exceeding (16 J) was made by John Linsley and Livio Scarsi at the Volcano Ranch experiment in New Mexico in 1962.

Cosmic ray particles with even higher energies have since been observed. Among them was the Oh-My-God particle observed by the University of Utah&#x27;s Fly&#x27;s Eye experiment on the evening of 15 October 1991 over Dugway Proving Ground, Utah. Its observation was shocking to astrophysicists, who estimated its energy at approximately (50 J)—essentially an atomic nucleus with kinetic energy equal to a baseball () traveling at about .

The energy of this particle is some 40 million times that of the highest energy protons that have been produced in any terrestrial particle accelerator. However, only a small fraction of this energy would be available for an interaction with a proton or neutron on Earth, with most of the energy remaining in the form of kinetic energy of the products of the interaction (see ). The effective energy available for such a collision is the square root of double the product of the particle&#x27;s energy and the mass energy of the proton, which for this particle gives , roughly 50 times the collision energy of the Large Hadron Collider.

Since the first observation, by the University of Utah&#x27;s Fly&#x27;s Eye Cosmic Ray Detector, at least fifteen similar events have been recorded, confirming the phenomenon. These very high energy cosmic ray particles are very rare; the energy of most cosmic ray particles is between 10 MeV and 10 GeV.

===Pierre Auger Observatory===

Pierre Auger Observatory is an international cosmic ray observatory designed to detect ultra-high-energy cosmic ray particles (with energies beyond 1020 eV). These high-energy particles have an estimated arrival rate of just 1 per square kilometer per century, therefore, in order to record a large number of these events, the Auger Observatory has created a detection area of 3,000 km2 (the size of Rhode Island) in Mendoza Province, western Argentina. The Pierre Auger Observatory, in addition to obtaining directional information from the cluster of water-Cherenkov tanks used to observe the cosmic-ray-shower components, also has four telescopes trained on the night sky to observe fluorescence of the nitrogen molecules as the shower particles traverse the sky, giving further directional information on the original cosmic ray particle.

In September 2017, data from 12 years of observations from PAO supported an extragalactic source (outside of Earth&#x27;s galaxy) for the origin of extremely high energy cosmic rays.

==Suggested origins==
The origin of these rare highest energy cosmic rays is not known. Since observations find no correlation with the Galactic plane and Galactic magnetic fields are not strong enough to accelerate particles to these energies, these cosmic rays are believed to have extra-galactic origin.
===Neutron stars===
One suggested source of UHECR particles is their origination from neutron stars. In young neutron stars with spin periods of &lt;10 ms, the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) forces from the quasi-neutral fluid of superconducting protons and electrons existing in a neutron superfluid accelerate iron nuclei to UHECR velocities. The neutron superfluid in rapidly rotating stars creates a magnetic field of 108 to 1011 teslas, at which point the neutron star is classified as a magnetar. This magnetic field is the strongest stable field in the observed universe and creates the relativistic MHD wind believed to accelerate iron nuclei remaining from the supernova to the necessary energy.

Another hypothesized source of UHECRs from neutron stars is during neutron star to strange star combustion. This hypothesis relies on the assumption that strange matter is the ground state of matter which has no experimental or observational data to support it. Due to the immense gravitational pressures from the neutron star, it is believed that small pockets of matter consisting of &quot;up&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, and &quot;strange&quot; quarks in equilibrium acting as a single hadron (as opposed to a number of baryons). This will then combust the entire star to strange matter, at which point the neutron star becomes a strange star and its magnetic field breaks down, which occurs because the protons and neutrons in the quasi-neutral fluid have become strangelets. This magnetic field breakdown releases large amplitude electromagnetic waves (LAEMWs). The LAEMWs accelerate light ion remnants from the supernova to UHECR energies.

&quot;Ultra-high-energy cosmic ray &quot;electrons&quot;&quot; (defined as electrons with energies of ≥1014eV) might be explained by the Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration in the magnetospheres of the Crab-like Pulsars. The feasibility of electron acceleration to this energy scale in the Crab pulsar magnetosphere is supported by the 2019 observation of ultra-high-energy gamma rays coming from the Crab Nebula, a young pulsar with a spin period of 33 ms.

===Active galactic cores===
Interactions with blue-shifted cosmic microwave background radiation limit the distance that these particles can travel before losing energy; this is known as the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit or GZK limit.

The source of such high energy particles has been a mystery for many years. Recent results from the Pierre Auger Observatory show that ultra-high-energy cosmic ray arrival directions appear to be correlated with extragalactic supermassive black holes at the center of nearby galaxies called active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, since the angular correlation scale used is fairly large (3.1°) these results do not unambiguously identify the origins of such cosmic ray particles. The AGN could merely be closely associated with the actual sources, for example in galaxies or other astrophysical objects that are clumped with matter on large scales within 100 megaparsecs.

Some of the supermassive black holes in AGN are known to be rotating, as in the Seyfert galaxy MCG 6-30-15 with time-variability in their inner accretion disks. Black hole spin is a potentially effective agent to drive UHECR production, provided ions are suitably launched to circumvent limiting factors deep within the galactic nucleus, notably curvature radiation and inelastic scattering with radiation from the inner disk. Low-luminosity, intermittent Seyfert galaxies may meet the requirements with the formation of a linear accelerator several light years away from the nucleus, yet within their extended ion tori whose UV radiation ensures a supply of ionic contaminants. The corresponding electric fields are small, on the order of 10 V/cm, whereby the observed UHECRs are indicative for the astronomical size of the source. Improved statistics by the Pierre Auger Observatory will be instrumental in identifying the presently tentative association of UHECRs (from the Local Universe) with Seyferts and LINERs.

===Other possible sources of the particles===
In addition to neutron stars and active galactic nuclei, the best candidate sources of the UHECR are:
* Supernova remnants
* intergalactic shocks created during the epoch of galaxy formation
* gamma-ray bursts
* relativistic supernovae
===Relation with dark matter===

It is hypothesized that active galactic nuclei are capable of converting dark matter into high energy protons. Yuri Pavlov and Andrey Grib at the Alexander Friedmann Laboratory for Theoretical Physics in Saint Petersburg hypothesize that dark matter particles are about 15 times heavier than protons, and that they can decay into pairs of heavier virtual particles of a type that interacts with ordinary matter. Near an active galactic nucleus, one of these particles can fall into the black hole, while the other escapes, as described by the Penrose process. Some of those particles will collide with incoming particles; these are very high energy collisions which, according to Pavlov, can form ordinary visible protons with very high energy. Pavlov then claims that evidence of such processes are ultra-high-energy cosmic ray particles.

== Propagation ==
Ultra-high-energy particles can interact with the photons in the cosmic microwave background while traveling over cosmic distances. This lead to a predicted high energy cutoff for those cosmic rays known as the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit (GZK limit) which matches observed cosmic ray spectra. 

The propagation of particles can also be affected by cosmic magnetic fields. While there is some studies of galactic magnetic fields, the origin and scale of 
extragalactic magnetic fields are poorly understood.

<doc id="474591" wikidata="Q7762658" url="?curid=474591" title="The Scouring of the Shire">
<text>&quot;The Scouring of the Shire&quot; is the penultimate chapter of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fantasy &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The Fellowship hobbits, Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin, return home to the Shire to find that it is under the brutal control of ruffians and their leader &quot;Sharkey&quot;, revealed to be the Wizard Saruman. The ruffians have despoiled the Shire, cutting down trees and destroying old houses, as well as replacing the old mill with a larger one full of machinery which pollutes the air and the water. The hobbits rouse the Shire to rebellion, lead their fellow hobbits to victory in the Battle of Bywater, and end Saruman&#x27;s rule.

Critics have considered &quot;The Scouring of the Shire&quot; the most important chapter in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Although Tolkien denied that the chapter was an allegory for Britain in the aftermath of World War II, commentators have argued that it can be applied to that period, with clear contemporary political references that include a satire of socialism, echoes of Nazism, allusions to the shortages in postwar Britain, and a strand of environmentalism.

According to Tolkien, the idea of such a chapter was planned from the outset as part of the overall formal structure of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, though its details were not worked out until much later. The chapter was intended to counterbalance the larger plot, concerning the physical journey to destroy the One Ring, with a moral quest upon the return home, to purify the Shire and to take personal responsibility. Tolkien considered other identities for the wicked Sharkey before settling on Saruman late in his composition process.

The chapter, which has been called one of the most famous anticlimaxes in literature, has generally been excluded from film adaptations of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Peter Jackson&#x27;s film trilogy omits the chapter, but maintains two key elements: a burning Shire, glimpsed by Frodo in the crystal ball-like Mirror of Galadriel; and the means of Saruman&#x27;s death, transposed to Isengard.

== Fictional history ==

=== Context ===
The chapter follows all the main action of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The story tells how the One Ring, a ring of power made by the Dark Lord Sauron, lost for many centuries, has reappeared and is in the hands of a hobbit, Frodo Baggins, in the England-like Shire. If Sauron finds the Ring, he will use it to take over the whole of Middle-earth. A Wizard, Gandalf, tells Frodo the history of the ring and persuades him to leave the Shire to destroy the Ring. He is joined by three other hobbits, his friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin. They are pursued by Sauron&#x27;s Black Riders, but escape to a stronghold of the Elves, Rivendell. There, they learn that it can only be destroyed in the volcano, Mount Doom, where Sauron forged the Ring, in the evil land of Mordor. They are joined by others opposed to Sauron, forming a Fellowship of the Ring, led by Gandalf. They face many perils on the journey, and the Fellowship is split up. Merry and Pippin become involved in wars against the evil Wizard Saruman and then against Sauron: Merry becomes a knight of Rohan, while Pippin becomes a guard of Gondor. With Sauron distracted, Frodo and Sam manage to travel to Mount Doom. The Ring is destroyed in the Cracks of Doom, and Sauron is overthrown. The hobbits, much changed by their experiences, ride home to the Shire, hoping to return to a peaceful rural life.

=== The scouring ===

The hobbits of the Fellowship – Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin – returning home to the Shire, come to its border, the Brandywine Bridge, late at night. They are surprised to find it barred, but are taken in, after some convincing, by the Shiriffs, a kind of hobbit police, who are guarding the bridge. They are shocked at the state of the Shire, with endless rules, ugly new buildings, and wanton destruction of trees and old buildings. Sam recognises one of the Shiriffs and tells him he should be ashamed of himself for joining in with &quot;such nonsense&quot;. All the cheerful inns are closed, so the Fellowship hobbits stay in the depressing, badly-built new Shiriff-house.

Setting off on ponies for Hobbiton at the centre of the Shire the next morning, the four hobbits are met by Shiriffs at the village of Frogmorton who attempt to arrest them for breaking several rules the night before. Unable to keep up with the ponies, the Shiriffs let the hobbits pass.

Reaching the village of Bywater, the four hobbits discover that Sandyman&#x27;s mill has been replaced by a big, noisy one full of machinery that fouls the water and pollutes the air; Ted Sandyman is the only hobbit who likes it, and he works for the Men who built it, where his father was his own boss. Merry, Pippin and Sam use their swords and their height to scare away a group of ruffians. The hobbits decide to &#x27;raise the Shire&#x27;; Merry blows the magic horn given to him by Éowyn of Rohan, while Sam recruits his neighbour Tom Cotton and his sons, who rouse the village. Cotton tells them that wagonloads of goods, including tobacco, have been sent &quot;away&quot;, causing shortages; they were paid for with unexplained funds by Lotho Sackville-Baggins, known as the &quot;Chief&quot; or the &quot;Boss&quot;, who moved into Frodo&#x27;s home, Bag End, when Frodo left on the quest to destroy the Ring. Pippin rides to his home village, Tuckborough, to rally his kin, the large Took clan. A gang of twenty ruffians from Hobbiton try to take farmer Cotton prisoner; the leader of the gang is killed with arrows, and the other ruffians quickly surrender.

The next morning the hobbits at Bywater learn that Pippin&#x27;s father, Thain Paladin II, has raised Tookland and is pursuing ruffians who have fled south; that Pippin will return with all the hobbits his father could spare; and that a much larger group of ruffians is heading towards them. Pippin returns with one hundred members of his family, before the ruffians arrive. Merry and Pippin lead the hobbits to victory in the brief Battle of Bywater. They ambush the ruffians by blocking a high-hedged lane with wagons in front of them and then behind them; most of the ruffians are killed. Frodo does not take part in the fighting.

The hobbits go to Hobbiton to visit Lotho. The whole area has been despoiled, and Bag End is apparently empty and unused. There they meet &quot;Sharkey&quot;, alias the Wizard Saruman; he is accompanied by his servant Wormtongue. He has lost his Wizard&#x27;s power, except for his deceptive voice; he tells them he has deliberately harmed their home in revenge. Frodo tells him to leave the Shire; Saruman in reply tries to stab Frodo, but the knife snaps on Frodo&#x27;s hidden coat of chain-mail. Frodo asks the other hobbits not to kill Saruman and offers Wormtongue the opportunity to stay. Saruman reveals that Wormtongue killed Lotho, provoking Wormtongue to cut Saruman&#x27;s throat. Wormtongue is shot dead by hobbit archers. A column of mist arises from Saruman&#x27;s corpse and is blown away in the wind.

=== Aftermath ===

After the scouring, &quot;the clearing up certainly needed a lot of work, but it took less time than Sam had feared&quot;. The cleanup is described in the first pages of the final chapter, &quot;The Grey Havens&quot;; the new buildings put up during Sharkey&#x27;s rule are torn down and their materials reused &quot;to repair many an old [hobbit] hole&quot;. Sam goes around the Shire planting saplings to replace lost trees, giving each one a grain of the dust from Galadriel&#x27;s garden; the single nut he plants in the Party Field. The work is successful: &quot;spring surpassed his wildest hopes&quot;, and &quot;altogether 1420 in the Shire was a marvellous year&quot;. A mallorn sapling like those of Lothlórien replaces the Party Tree, many children are born with &quot;a rich golden hair&quot;, and young hobbits &quot;very nearly bathed in strawberries and cream&quot;.

== Concept and creation ==
=== Formal structure ===


Tolkien scholars and critics have noted that the chapter implies some kind of formal structure for the whole work. The critic Bernhard Hirsch writes that &quot;The Scouring of the Shire&quot; has &quot;provoked considerable critical debate&quot;, unlike the rest of the &quot;homeward journey&quot; in Book 6. Hirsch accepts Tolkien&#x27;s statement in the foreword to the &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot; that the formal structure of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, namely a journey outward for the quest and a journey home, meant that the chapter, along with the other two chapters of the return journey, was &quot;foreseen from the outset&quot;. Another critic, Nicholas Birns, notes approvingly David Waito&#x27;s argument that the chapter is as important morally as the Fellowship&#x27;s main quest to destroy the One Ring, &quot;but applies [the morals] to daily life&quot;. The Tolkien scholar Paul Kocher writes that Frodo, having thrown aside his weapons and armour on Mount Doom, chooses to fight &quot;only on the moral plane&quot; in the Shire.

Birns goes further, arguing that the chapter has an important formal role in the overall composition of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, as Tolkien had stated. In Birns&#x27;s view, the chapter&#x27;s main surprise is the appearance of Saruman, and it was indeed, Birns writes, his presence that made it necessary to scour the Shire. Evidence that Tolkien had planned something of the sort is found, Birns notes, in Frodo&#x27;s vision of the future of the Shire in peril when he looks in the Mirror of Galadriel in Lothlorien in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;.

=== Origins ===

Scholars have identified several possible origins and antecedents for the chapter, and these have been added to by Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s exploration of the literary history of his father&#x27;s work on it over the years. Scholars agree that the &quot;Scouring&quot; has an ancient pedigree, echoing Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; when after long years away Odysseus returns to his home island of Ithaca to scour it of Penelope&#x27;s worthless suitors. Robert Plank adds that Tolkien could have chosen as a pattern any number of other returning heroes. This theme, of a last obstacle to the heroic homecoming, was paradoxically both long-planned (certainly back to the time of writing of the Lothlorien chapter) and, in the person of Saruman-as-Sharkey, &quot;a very late entry&quot;. David Greenman in addition contrasts the scouring with Tuor&#x27;s Aeneas-like escape from a wrecked kingdom as told in &quot;The Fall of Gondolin&quot;.

In &quot;Sauron Defeated&quot;, earlier drafts of the chapter show that Tolkien had considered giving Frodo a far more energetic part in confronting Sharkey and the ruffians. These throw light on Tolkien&#x27;s choice of who Sharkey actually was, whether the &quot;boss&quot; hobbit Lotho Sackville-Baggins, a human leader of the gang of ruffians, or Saruman. Tolkien had thus hesitated over how to implement the &quot;Scouring&quot;, only arriving at Saruman after trying other options. Birns argues that the effect is to bring the &quot;consequentiality of abroad&quot; (including Isengard, where Saruman was strong) back to the &quot;parochialism of home&quot;, not only scouring the Shire but also strengthening it, with Merry and Pippin as &quot;world citizens&quot;.

In his &quot;Foreword to the Second Edition&quot;, Tolkien denies that the chapter is an allegory or relates to events in or after the Second World War:

The Tolkien critic Tom Shippey writes that the Shire is certainly where Middle-earth comes nearest to the 20th century, and that the people who had commented that the &quot;Scouring of the Shire&quot; was about Tolkien&#x27;s contemporary England were not wholly wrong. Shippey suggests however that rather than seeing the chapter as an allegory of postwar England, it could be taken as an account of &quot;a society suffering not only from political misrule, but from a strange and generalized crisis of confidence.&quot; Shippey draws a parallel with a contemporary work, George Orwell&#x27;s 1938 novel &quot;Coming Up for Air&quot;, where England is subjected to a &quot;similar diagnosis&quot; of leaderless inertia.

Critics including Plank have noted that Tolkien denied that the &quot;Scouring of the Shire&quot; reflected England in the late 1940s, claiming instead that the chapter echoed his youthful experience of seeing his home at Sarehole, then in rural Warwickshire, being taken over by the growing city of Birmingham in the early 1900s. Tolkien related the chapter to his childhood experiences at the end of the 19th century:

Instead of a strict allegory with exact correspondences between the elements of the chapter and 20th century events and personages, Plank suggested that the chapter was &quot;a realistic parable of reality&quot;. Birns and others note, too, that there is an echo in the chapter of the soldiers, including Tolkien, returning home from the trenches of the First World War, and meeting an unfair lack of appreciation of their contribution, as when Sam&#x27;s father, Gaffer Gamgee, is more concerned with the damage to his potatoes than any &quot;trapessing in foreign parts&quot;.

== Significance ==

=== Satire on mid-20th century politics ===

Various commentators have noted that the chapter has political overtones. The critic Jerome Donnelly suggests that the chapter is a satire, of a more serious kind than the knockabout &quot;comedy of manners&quot; at the start of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Plank calls it a caricature of fascism. Donnelly agrees with Tolkien that the &quot;Scouring&quot; is not an allegory, but proposes that Saruman&#x27;s &quot;Ruffians&quot; echo the tyrannical behaviour of the Nazis, as do &quot;the use of collaborators, threats, torture and killing of dissenters, and internment&quot;.

Jay Richards and Jonathan Witt write that &quot;conservatives and progressives alike&quot; had seen the chapter as a &quot;pointed critique of modern socialism&quot;, citing the scholar of politics Hal Colebatch&#x27;s comment that the rule- and redistribution-heavy Saruman regime &quot;owed much to the drabness, bleakness and bureaucratic regulation of postwar Britain under the Attlee Labour Government&quot;. They note similarly Plank&#x27;s identification of &quot;parallels&quot; between the Shire under Saruman and both the German Nazi Party under Hitler and Italian Fascism under Mussolini. Plank discusses, for example, why the hobbits did not resist fascism, giving as reasons cowardice, lack of solidarity, and what he finds &quot;the most interesting and the most melancholy&quot;: the shirriff-hobbit&#x27;s statement &quot;I am sorry, Mr. Merry, but we have orders.&quot; Plank comments that this recalls statements from the Nuremberg trials. He further compares Saruman with Mussolini, noting that they both came to &quot;a miserable end&quot;. Richards and Witt concede that the chapter has wider themes, including the ugliness of Saruman&#x27;s &quot;vengeful heart&quot;, the nastiness of (sub)urban development, the hobbits&#x27; love-inspired defence of their homeland, and the need not to just obey orders, but state that Tolkien&#x27;s letters demonstrate his dislike of socialism, and that in the chapter Tolkien deftly satirizes &quot;socialism&#x27;s pose of moral superiority&quot;.

Shippey comments that whatever Tolkien&#x27;s protestations, readers back in the 1950s would have noticed some features of the Shire during the &quot;Scouring&quot; that &quot;seem[ed] slightly out of place&quot;, such as the fact that wagonloads of &quot;pipeweed&quot; (tobacco) are being taken away, seemingly at the wizard Saruman&#x27;s orders, with no visible in-universe explanation. What, Shippey asks, was Saruman doing with so much tobacco: a wizard was hardly going to be trading it for profit, nor &quot;issuing&quot; it to his orcs in Isengard. Instead, Shippey suggests, it echoes Britain&#x27;s shortages just after the Second World War, routinely explained at that time with &quot;the words &#x27;gone for export&#x27;&quot;. Kocher adds that the devastation and people&#x27;s responses in the Shire after the War would have been only too familiar to people in the 20th century.

Not all critics have seen the chapter as political; the medievalist Jane Chance notes the &quot;domestic image&quot; of the &quot;Scouring&quot; in the chapter&#x27;s title, suggesting in her view a &quot;rejuvenation&quot; of the Shire. She describes the chapter&#x27;s social cleansing of the Shire in similar terms, writing of washing and purifying it of &quot;the reptilian monsters&quot; Sharkey and Wormtongue.

=== A &quot;novelistic&quot; chapter ===

Tolkien critics have noted that the chapter has a distinctive novel-like quality. Birns echoes Plank&#x27;s comment that the chapter is &quot;fundamentally different from the rest of the book&quot;, and states that it is &quot;the most episode in Tolkien&#x27;s massive tale.&quot; He cites Janet Brennan Croft&#x27;s description of it as &quot;that deceptively anti-climactic but all-important chapter&quot;. Birns argues that it meets three aspects of Ian Watt&#x27;s definition of the kind of novel read by the middle class, dominant among the reading public: firstly, it shows multiple social classes interacting; secondly, it is in a domestic context, the homely Shire; thirdly, it favours the point of view of the &quot;emerging and aspiring middle classes&quot;. Birns concludes that &quot;&#x27;The Scouring of the Shire&#x27; is where Tolkien&#x27;s dark romance bends the most towards the realistic novel of domestic reintegration and redemption.&quot; Plank writes that the distinctive feature of the &quot;Scouring&quot; is that unlike in the rest of the book, there are no miracles and the laws of nature work with &quot;full and undisputed force&quot;. Saruman, Plank notes, was once able to work magic, but in the chapter he works as a politician, without sorcery: the chapter is &quot;realistic&quot;, not fantasy, except for the moment of Saruman&#x27;s death. 

Michael Treschow and Mark Duckworth, writing in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, note that the return to the Shire emphasises the protagonists&#x27; growth in character, so that they can deal with life&#x27;s challenges for themselves. Just as at the end of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; Gandalf tells Bilbo that he is &quot;not the hobbit that you were&quot;, having learnt from his adventures, so in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; Gandalf tells Frodo and the other hobbits that he will not be coming to the Shire with them since &quot;you will need no help. You are grown up now. Grown indeed very high; among the great you are, and I have no longer any fear at all for any of you.&quot;

=== Wish-fulfilment ===

Another element in the chapter is the appearance of Tolkien&#x27;s own feelings about England. Shippey writes that there is a &quot;streak of &#x27;wish-fulfilment&#x27;&quot; in the account, and that Tolkien would have liked &quot;to hear the horns of Rohan blow, and watch the Black Breath of inertia dissolve&quot; from England. More specifically, Shippey applies this idea to &quot;The Scouring of the Shire&quot;, noting that Merry returns from Rohan with a horn, brought by Eorl the Young, founder of Rohan, from the dragon-hoard of Scatha the Worm from the North. The horn, he explains, is &quot;a magic one, though only modestly so&quot;: blowing it brings joy to his friends in arms, fear to his enemies, and in the chapter, it awakens the &quot;revolution against sloth and shabbiness and Saruman-Sharkey&quot; and quickly gets the Shire purified. Shippey suggests that Tolkien wished to do the same, and notes that with his novels he at least succeeded in bringing joy. 
Tolkien wrote in a letter that &quot;the &quot;man-made&quot; ... is ultimately daunting and insupportable&quot;, and that &quot;If a Ragnarök would burn all the slums and gas-works, and shabby garages, and long arc-lit suburbs, it [could] for me burn all the works of art – and I&#x27;d go back to trees.&quot; Caitlin Vaughn Carlos writes that Sam Gamgee&#x27;s exclamation &quot;This is worse than Mordor! ... It comes home to you, they say; because it is home, and you remember it before it was ruined&quot; encapsulates the impulse to nostalgia, since Sam is longing for the remembered home, not the one which now exists.

=== Environmentalism ===

Critics since the 1970s have observed one more theme in the chapter: environmentalism. One of the first to note that &quot;Tolkien was [an] ecologist&quot; was Paul H. Kocher. Birns calls it &quot;as much conservationist as it is traditionalist&quot;, writing that it presents a strong pro-environmentalist argument in addition to its other themes. Plank describes the chapter&#x27;s emphasis on the &quot;deterioration of the environment&quot; &quot;quite unusual for its time&quot;, with the returning hobbits finding needless destruction of the old and beautiful, and its replacement by the new and ugly; pollution of air and water; neglect; &quot;and above all, trees wantonly destroyed&quot;. Matthew Dickerson and Jonathan Evans look at the chapter from the point of view of rousing people to environmental action in their &quot;own backyard&quot;.

=== A pacifist dilemma ===

The scholars Nan Scott and Janet Brennan Croft have commented on the pacifist dilemma embodied in the chapter. The hobbits return home from the War of the Ring, wanting peace, but find themselves obliged to fight, and indeed to lead the fighting, to rid the Shire of the enemy. Scott notes that the hobbits were indeed so innocent and peace-loving that they had set out for Rivendell without weapons; and they are surprised when Tom Bombadil gives them swords from the Barrow-wight&#x27;s hoard. Aragorn states at Rivendell that the Shire is peaceful only because it is constantly watched by his Rangers. Further, Scott writes, Tolkien shows war to be at once &quot;exhilarating and thrilling&quot;, as at the Battle of Helm&#x27;s Deep, and ugly, as when human heads are catapulted into the besieged Minas Tirith. Frodo feels pity even for Saruman; but his pacifism will not rid the Shire of Saruman&#x27;s ruffians. Merry, seeing the dilemma, tells Frodo &quot;if there are many of these ruffians ... it will certainly mean fighting.&quot;

=== Other opinions ===

Brian Attebery, introducing Birns&#x27;s article in &quot;Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts&quot;, notes that Birns calls &quot;The Scouring of the Shire&quot; &quot;one of the most famous anticlimaxes in literature&quot;, and that conventional wisdom is to stop at once when the action has completed. Attebery begs to differ, saying that he likes anticlimaxes, as when Jane Austen&#x27;s heroes and heroines work everything out in detail once they have at last reached agreement. In his view, the novel &quot;would be much the less&quot; without the chapter.

Tolkien critics John D. Rateliff and Jared Lobdell have compared the sudden shrivelling of Saruman&#x27;s flesh from his skull at the moment of his death with the instantaneous aging of the protagonist Ayesha in Rider Haggard&#x27;s 1887 novel &quot;&quot;, when she bathes in the fire of immortality. Tolkien acknowledged Haggard as a major influence, especially &quot;She&quot;.

In an interview in 2015, the novelist and screenwriter George R. R. Martin called this section of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; story brilliant, and said it was the tone he would be aiming for at the end of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

Jonathon D. Langford, writing in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, describes the scouring as the hobbits&#x27; coming of age, the culmination of their individual quests. He states that Merry and Pippin have clearly matured on their journey, while Frodo and Sam see the success of their quest reassessed by hobbit society. He notes that a heroic quest as described by Joseph Campbell ends with the hero&#x27;s return from the enchanted lands to the ordinary world, renewing his community, as the hobbits&#x27; return does.

== Adaptations ==

The 1981 BBC &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; radio play covers &quot;The Scouring of the Shire&quot;, including the original showdown and ending in which Saruman dies by Wormtongue&#x27;s knife and Wormtongue is killed by arrows in the Shire.

The events of &quot;The Scouring of the Shire&quot; are retold in the Finnish miniseries &quot;Hobitit&quot;.

The chapter has been left out of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, except as a brief flash-forward when Frodo looks into the crystal ball-like Mirror of Galadriel in Peter Jackson&#x27;s 2001 &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. In the extended edition of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, Wormtongue kills Saruman (stabbing him in the back, not slitting his throat) and is in turn killed by an arrow as in the chapter; however, this takes place at Isengard instead of the Shire and it is Legolas who shoots Wormtongue. Peter Jackson called the chapter anticlimactic, and decided in 1998 not to include it in the film trilogy. He decided to merge Saruman&#x27;s and Wormtongue&#x27;s death scene with &quot;The Voice of Saruman&quot; chapter from &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, but did not wish to go back to Isengard after the Battle of Helm&#x27;s Deep. Jackson explained that in post-production of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, the scene felt like a seven-minute wrap up of &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, gave the film an unsteady beginning, and made the film too long, so it ended up in the extended DVD. 

Alan Lee, in the last of his series of 50 illustrations of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, depicted the four hobbits of the Fellowship returning on horseback along a hedged lane, with the stumps of recently cut trees and felled trunks in the foreground, and a tall chimney making a plume of dark smoke in the background. The painting was reviewed for &quot;Mythlore&quot; by Glen GoodKnight, who wrote that it was &quot;, containing no joy, and denying us even the hint of the bitter-sweet resolution of the story&quot;.

== History ==
Ball Aerospace began building pointing controls for military rockets in 1956. The aerospace part of the Ball Corporation was then known as Ball Brothers Research Corporation, and later won a contract to build some of NASA&#x27;s first spacecraft, the Orbiting Solar Observatory satellites. The company has been responsible for numerous technological and scientific projects and continues to provide aerospace technology to NASA and related industries.

<text>The green oriole or Australasian yellow oriole (Oriolus flavocinctus) is an inconspicuous inhabitant of lush tropical vegetation throughout Australia and New Guinea.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Alternate names for the green oriole include the Australian yellow oriole, yellow oriole and yellow-bellied oriole.

===Subspecies===
Six subspecies are recognised: 
* &quot;O. f. migrator&quot; - : Found in eastern Lesser Sundas
* &quot;O. f. muelleri&quot; - : Originally described as a separate species. Found in south-central New Guinea
* &quot;O. f. flavocinctus&quot; - : Found in northern Australia
* &quot;O. f. tiwi&quot; - : Found on Bathurst and Melville Islands (off northern Australia)
* &quot;O. f. flavotinctus&quot; - : Found on Cape York Peninsula (north-eastern Australia)
* &quot;O. f. kingi&quot; - : Found in north-eastern Queensland (north-eastern Australia)

==Distribution and habitat==
They are often difficult to locate, as their yellow-green plumage blends with the foliage and only their deep bubbling musical calls can be heard. They are nevertheless common in suitable habitat: rainforests, mangroves, thickets along watercourses, swamps, and lush gardens.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
Breeding takes place during the wet season (October to March). A neat, deep cup is constructed from strips of bark and vines, lined with rootlets, and slung between leafy branches, usually 5-15 m up. They typically lay two eggs.

===Food and feeding===
Green orioles forage slowly and methodically through the middle and upper strata of dense forests, taking fruit in the main. Typically alone or in pairs, they sometimes form small flocks in the nonbreeding season.

<text>Michael George Bichard, Baron Bichard, (born 31 January 1947) is a former public servant in the United Kingdom, first in local and then as a civil servant in central government. He was director of the Institute for Government, currently serves as one of its first fellows, and was chair of the Design Council. He was a created a crossbench life peer on 24 March 2010. He is an advisor to The Key Support Services Limited, which provide leadership and management support to school leaders and governors. He became chair of the Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE) in 2013.

== Career ==
Bichard served as the chief executive of Brent Council between 1980 and 1986, and then of Gloucestershire County Council between 1986 and 1990, when he was appointed chief executive of the Benefits Agency.

In 1995, Bichard was made Permanent Secretary of the Department for Employment. When it merged with the Department for Education (DfE) to form the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE), he became Permanent Secretary of the combined department, under Gillian Shephard, and then, post-1997, David Blunkett. He became extremely close to Blunkett, even at one point intervening personally – according to the National press – to ensure that details of an affair that Blunkett was conducting with his Private Secretary should not become public.

During his time as Permanent Secretary, he introduced several modernising reforms to the department, notably in bringing its use of information technology and new media up to date. He oversaw some significant changes to the education policy landscape, such as the introduction of the Learning and Skills Council to fund further education and apprenticeships.

In May 2001, he retired from the Civil Service, when DfEE and the Department for Social Security were split into the Department for Education and Skills and Department for Work and Pensions.

== After retirement ==
In September 2001, Bichard was appointed Rector of The University of the Arts London and also served as chairman of the Design Council. In 2004, the Home Secretary David Blunkett (previously Bichard&#x27;s minister as Secretary of State for Education and Employment) appointed Bichard to chair an inquiry into the &quot;Soham murders&quot; of two 10-year-old girls; the inquiry has since been known as the &quot;Bichard Inquiry&quot;.

Bichard was non-executive chairman of RSe Consulting from 2003 to 2008. RSe Consulting provided strategic and management consulting services to local government and became part of Tribal Group Plc in 2008. He was appointed chairman of the Legal Services Commission in April 2005. There he introduced a range of reforming measures aimed at modernising the legal aid system. He was also chairman of the educational charity Rathbone. Bichard left these two roles in September 2008 when he became the Director of the Institute for Government. He became chairman of the board of FILMCLUB, a nationwide after-school film club scheme which is free to state primary and secondary schools.

He has been an advisor to Ten Group, the lifestyle concierge and professional support services company, since 2010, supporting the development of its school leader and school governor support services – The Key and Ten Governor Support. Bichard came in for criticism in October 2012 when he suggested that retired people should contribute to society by doing community work in order to help the state or lose their pension. Robert Oxley of the Tax Payers Alliance said &quot;it&#x27;s a bit rich from a civil servant who was able to retire early to lecture us on working during retirement&quot;.

He became chair of the Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE) in 2013. He is chair of the international editorial board of Public Money &amp; Management and chairs the journal&#x27;s annual PMM Live! event.

Following a governance scandal at the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, in December 2021, the RICS announced Bichard would lead a six-month review into its governance and future purpose. The 68-page Bichard review, recommending sweeping reforms, was published on 21 June 2022.

Bichard said: &quot;My aim has been to help create a new sense of purpose and direction so that RICS can once more stand tall as an exemplar professional institution.&quot; In August 2022, Bichard was appointed as interim senior independent governor through to 31 December 2023, responsible for scrutinising the actions of the RICS&#x27; governing council and committees.

In April 2022, he was announced as the new Chancellor of the University of Gloucestershire, succeeding Baroness Rennie Fritchie.

== Honours and peerage ==
Bichard was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 1999 Birthday Honours. On the recommendation of the House of Lords Appointments Commission, he was created a life peer on 24 March 2010, as Baron Bichard, &quot;of Nailsworth in the County of Gloucestershire&quot;. He was introduced in the House of Lords on 29 March, where he sits on the crossbenches.

<doc id="474600" wikidata="Q316235" url="?curid=474600" title="Tzannis Tzannetakis">
<text>Tzannis Tzannetakis (; 13 September 1927 – 1 April 2010) was a Greek politician who was briefly Prime Minister of Greece during the political crisis of 1989. He also served as a submarine commander in the Hellenic Navy.

==Biography==
Tzannetakis was born in Gytheio in the region of Mani in 1927. He served as a military officer but resigned on 22 April 1967, the day after the military coup d&#x27;état which brought the dictatorship of Georgios Papadopoulos to power. He was imprisoned by the military junta from 1969 to 1971 for his resistance activity.

When democracy was restored in 1974, Tzannetakis joined the New Democracy party of Constantine Karamanlis. From 1974 to 1977 he served as General Secretary of the Ministry of Tourism. He was elected to the Greek Parliament in 1977 and served as Minister for Public Works in the government of Georgios Rallis (1980–81).

==Prime minister==
The June 1989 Greek legislative election left the PASOK party of Andreas Papandreou in the minority, following a series of corruption scandals, including Koskotas scandal. New Democracy, however, now led by Constantine Mitsotakis, could not form a government despite its significant lead in the popular vote because of changes to Greek electoral law that PASOK had voted into effect just before the elections. The result was the formation of the first coalition government since the fall of the Greek dictatorship in 1974, and the first government to include the Communist left since 1944.

The government was based on an alliance between ND and the Coalition of Forces of the Left and Progress (Synaspismos), which then included the Communist Party of Greece, with a mandate to conduct a clean-up (&quot;katharsis&quot;) after the scandals. The agreement was for a short-term government that would last only until the process of parliamentary investigation of those Members of Parliament accused of involvement in the scandals had been completed. Tzannetakis was a compromise candidate for Prime Minister, given that the left refused to accept Mitsotakis in this role. In contrast, Tzannetakis was acceptable to the left because of his credentials from the anti-Junta resistance. In addition to the premiership, Tzannetakis also retained the portfolios of Foreign Affairs and of Tourism.

The formation of a government bringing together the Greek right and the communist left symbolized national reconciliation after the 1940s civil war. One of the government&#x27;s acts was to burn all the secret police files held on Greek citizens during the post-Civil War period.

The parliamentary investigation into the scandals concluded with lifting the parliamentary immunity of several former government ministers, including former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou himself, and their referral to the justice system. This was the first time a former Greek Prime Minister had been referred for trial.

The Tzannetakis government also abolished the state monopoly on TV broadcasting and allowed private TV stations to function for the first time.

==Aftermath==
In accordance with the initial agreement among the coalition partners, the government resigned in October. Yiannis Grivas then formed a caretaker government until fresh elections could be held. New Democracy won these elections, too, but once more could not form a government despite tallying 46% of the vote, with PASOK coming second with 40%. In November, an &quot;ecumenical government,&quot; headed by Xenophon Zolotas, with the participation of all three political parties (New Democracy, PASOK, Synaspismos) was formed, again with an agreement for a short-term mandate to last until the election of the President of the Republic, due the following March. In the Zolotas government, Tzannis Tzannetakis served as Minister for Tourism and National Defence. In the election of April 1990, for the third consecutive time within a year, New Democracy won, this time with an even more significant lead of 8% over PASOK, securing the party a one-seat majority. In the Mitsotakis government, Tzannetakis became Deputy Prime Minister, a post he held until the government fell in 1993. He remained a Member of the Greek Parliament until September 2007, when he announced his intention to retire from political activity.

Tzannetakis died in an Athens hospital on 1 April 2010 at the age of 82.

==Early life and education ==
Pill was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Her father, a professional engineer, is Estonian. Pill attended Vaughan Road Academy, in its Interact program, designed for studying dance, music, athletics, and theatre.

==Career==
=== 1997–2007: Rise to prominence ===

Pill decided to become an actor when she was 10 years old. As a member of the Toronto Children&#x27;s Chorus, she was chosen to narrate one of their performances. Her mother tried to discourage Pill by getting her a job as a background performer on the series &quot;Kung Fu: The Legend Continues&quot;. By the time she was 11, she had played a guest role on an episode of the children&#x27;s series &quot;The New Ghostwriter Mysteries&quot;. At 12, she landed roles in two TV movies and a mini-series, a guest appearance on the TV series &quot;Psi Factor&quot; and voiced the character &quot;Cornflower&quot; on the animated series &quot;Redwall&quot; (1999–2001). After roles in two more television movies, she landed her first feature film role, a small-budget Canadian movie called &quot;The Life Before This&quot; in 1999, followed by the role of Jacob&#x27;s older sister Marfa in &quot;Jacob Two Two Meets the Hooded Fang&quot;. Pill played roles in four more TV movies before the age of fourteen. The next year, she landed a small role in &quot;Skipped Parts&quot; in 2000 starring Drew Barrymore and Mischa Barton, then appeared in four more TV movies and features that year, including playing Farrah Fawcett&#x27;s daughter in the TNT network movie &quot;Baby&quot; and a lead role in the Canadian film &quot;The Dinosaur Hunter&quot;, which was originally intended to be shown at a dinosaur museum and on a provincial education channel, but which made its way to the Burbank International Film Festival, winning Pill an award for Best Child Actress. 

She landed the role of young Lorna in the ABC-TV biopic &quot;Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows&quot; in 2001, based on the memoir by Garland&#x27;s daughter, Lorna Luft. That year, Pill also played Sissy Spacek&#x27;s daughter in the TV flick &quot;Midwives&quot;. In 2003, she played Katie Holmes&#x27;s sister in the indie feature &quot;Pieces of April&quot;. Pill won the lead in the CTV-TV movie &quot;Fast Food High&quot;, about a teenager who gets a job at a fast food restaurant and tries to set up a union. She also landed a supporting role in &quot;Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen&quot; in 2003, starring Lindsay Lohan. Pill ventured off into stage acting, with the New York City staging of &quot;None of the Above&quot; as the first item in her theatre credentials. In 2006, she starred as Grace Webster in the short-lived NBC drama &quot;The Book of Daniel&quot;. That same year, she made her Broadway debut playing Mairead in Martin McDonagh&#x27;s black comedy play &quot;The Lieutenant of Inishmore&quot; for which she was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play. 

Because of her busy work schedule, Pill&#x27;s schooling was done through a program for children in the entertainment industry. Since graduating from high school, Pill moved to New York to pursue a career in theatre, but continued to work in movies such as &quot;Dan in Real Life&quot; in 2007. She returned to Broadway in the Theresa Rebeck play &quot;Mauritius&quot; (2007) acting alongside F. Murray Abraham, Bobby Cannavale, and Dylan Baker. John Lahr of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; praised Pill describing her as &quot;excellent&quot; adding, &quot;It says something about the appeal of Alison Pill—an actress with a big future—that her compelling combination of ferocity and fragility carries the audience beyond the inconsistencies of the story.&quot; That same year she acted in the Manhattan Theatre Club production of the David Harrower play &quot;Blackbird&quot; starring alongside Jeff Daniels. The production was directed by Joe Mantello and was helmed at New York City Center&#x27;s Stage I. For her performance she received the Drama League Award, Lucille Lortel Award, and Outer Critics Circle Awards nominations. This was followed by &quot;The Distance From Here&quot;, &quot;On the Mountain&quot;.

=== 2008–2014: Film roles and &quot;The Newsroom&quot; ===

Pill had a major supporting role as campaign manager Anne Kronenberg in the 2008 film &quot;Milk&quot;. In 2009, she performed with Erin Hill &amp; her Psychedelic Harp playing the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;-inspired &quot;Meredith Moon&quot; and &quot;The Real North Pole&quot; sci-fi Christmas Harp. Pill was cast as April on &quot;In Treatment&quot;. In 2009 she replaced Elliot Page in a role in &quot;Jack &amp; Diane&quot; but due to postponement of the project neither ended up in it by the time it ran in 2012. She later played Kim Pine in the movie &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot;, as well as in &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the Animation&quot;. She portrayed Empress Maud in the miniseries &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot;. In theatre, Pill starred with Abigail Breslin in the Broadway revival of the William Gibson play &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; (2010), David Rooney of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Pill has demonstrated her skill at animating prickly contemporary women who can go from sullen vulnerability into bellicose attack mode in a flash. She&#x27;s no less convincing as 20-year-old Boston-Irish Sullivan, hired in 1887 by the Keller family in Alabama to serve as governess to Helen, left deaf and blind by an illness in her infancy&quot;. 

The following year she acted in another Broadway revival, the John Guare play &quot;The House of Blue Leaves&quot; with Ben Stiller, Edie Falco, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Thomas Sadoski. In the play she portrayed a kindly, partially deaf actress. She received positive reviews with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; describing her as &quot;delightfully daffy&quot;, and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; declaring, &quot;Pill&#x27;s funny-sad ethereal performance exposes the cultivated poise and glamour of Hollywood as another empty fantasy&quot;. She appeared in Woody Allen&#x27;s acclaimed romantic comedy &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot; (2011) portraying Zelda Fitzgerald alongside Tom Hiddleston as F. Scott Fitzgerald. The following year she reunited with Allen playing Hayley in &quot;To Rome with Love&quot; (2012). She has starred in short films including &quot;Denise&quot; in 2012 with Chris Messina and &quot;Santa Baby;&quot; she sang and danced in &quot;Santa Baby&quot;. In 2016, she appeared in &quot;Cover Up&quot; by Satya Bhabha with Jason Ritter, to be released at the LA Shorts Fest, and &quot;Woman in Deep&quot;, where she played a woman who calls a suicide prevention hot line and is put on hold, directed by Janicza Bravo. 

From 2012 until its ending in 2014, she was in the HBO political drama series &quot;The Newsroom&quot; portraying journalist Maggie Jordan at a fictional cable news show. In a Geffen Playhouse production of &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; (2013), Pill starred as a blind woman who must fend for her life. Myron Meisel of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; compared Pill&#x27;s performance favorably to previous actors who played the role such as Lee Remick and Audrey Hepburn, writing &quot;the reliably talented Pill instills [the role] with a distinctive individuality.&quot; 

She starred in Bong Joon-ho&#x27;s post-apocalyptic film &quot;Snowpiercer&quot;, alongside Chris Evans and Tilda Swinton, which was released in 2013. Pill appeared in &quot;Cooties&quot; (2014) starring Elijah Wood. In &quot;Zoom&quot;, Pill played Emma, an aspiring comic book artist.

=== 2015–present ===
She acted in the Coen Brothers comedy &quot;Hail, Caesar!&quot; (2015) playing Eddie Mannix&#x27;s wife. Pill starred in &quot;&quot; as Eva Glatt, Glatt&#x27;s love interest in first movie &quot;Goon&quot;, now married to Glatt. Pill was part of the cast of &quot;The Family&quot; as Willa Warren. In 2016, Pill co-starred with Jessica Chastain in the EuropaCorp thriller &quot;Miss Sloane&quot;. In 2017, she joined &quot;American Horror Story: Cult&quot;, starring as Ivy Mayfair-Richards, one of the main characters of the storyline. In 2018 she played former Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s daughter Mary in the Oscar-nominated film &quot;Vice&quot;. That same year she acted in the Broadway revival of the Edward Albee memory play &quot;Three Tall Women&quot; acting alongside Glenda Jackson and Laurie Metcalf.

In 2020, she was part of the TV series &quot;Devs&quot; directed by Alex Garland on FX on Hulu, playing Katie, the chief designer of the Devs system. In 2021, she starred in the film &quot;All My Puny Sorrows&quot; with Sarah Gadon, as two Mennonite sisters who leave their religious lives behind. Alison won Best Actress in a Canadian Film by Vancouver Film Critics Circle for her role in the movie. Pill was also part of the TV series &quot;Them,&quot; playing Betty Wendell. For the first two seasons of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, she played scientist Dr. Agnes Jurati. Pill returned to Broadway playing Sonya in the 2024 revival of the Anton Chekov play &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; starring opposite Steve Carell, William Jackson Harper, Jayne Houdyshell, and Alfred Molina at Lincoln Center. David Cote of &quot;The Observer&quot; hailed her performance writing, &quot;Pill proves to be the evening&#x27;s MVP&quot; adding, &quot;[She] embodies that brokenness with a palpable heat I wish could have ignited everything around her&quot;.

==Personal life==
Pill was engaged to actor Jay Baruchel from 2011 to 2013. Baruchel made their engagement public when he thanked Pill as his fiancée during an acceptance speech at the Genie Awards in Ottawa, Ontario. Baruchel alluded to their break-up in a Twitter posting on February 16, 2013.

Pill married actor Joshua Leonard May 24, 2015, having become engaged that January. They have a daughter, Wilder, born November 19, 2016.

<doc id="474609" wikidata="Q3342004" url="?curid=474609" title="Rhododendron atlanticum">
<text>Rhododendron atlanticum, the dwarf azalea or coastal azalea, is a species of &quot;Rhododendron&quot; native to coastal areas of the eastern United States, from New Jersey south to Georgia.

It is a very tough plant, responding to overgrazing or forest fires by generating new shoots.

== Description ==
&quot;Rhododendron atlanticum&quot; is a compact, loosely branched, deciduous shrub that typically grows to be two to three feet tall at maturity but can grow up to six feet, and is two to three feet wide. It is a deciduous shrub tall, forming a thick understory in forests, spreading by underground stolons. The leaves are 3–5 cm long and 1–2 cm broad, bluish green, and hairless or with scattered glandular hairs. The fragrant flowers are 3–4 cm long, usually white to pink, sometimes with a flush of yellow; they are produced in trusses of 4-10 together.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Rhododendron atlanticum&quot; is found in upland woods, on bluffs, stream banks and open sandy woods. This species ranges from Delaware to Georgia in the mid-Atlantic and southeastern United States.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Rhododendron atlanticum&quot; has nine synonyms listed below:

* &quot;Azalea atlantica&quot; Ashe
* &quot;Azalea atlantica&quot; var. &quot;luteoalba&quot; Coker
* &quot;Azalea neglecta&quot; Ashe
* &quot;Rhododendron atlanticum&quot; f. &quot;confusum&quot; Fernald
* &quot;Rhododendron atlanticum&quot; f. &quot;luteoalbum&quot; (Coker) Fernald
* &quot;Rhododendron atlanticum&quot; var. &quot;luteoalbum&quot; (Coker) Rehder
* &quot;Rhododendron atlanticum&quot; f. &quot;neglectum&quot; (Ashe) Rehder
* &quot;Rhododendron atlanticum&quot; f. &quot;tomolobum&quot; Fernald
* &quot;Rhododendron neglectum&quot; (Ashe) Ashe

== Uses ==
&quot;Rhododendron atlanticum&quot; can be used in azalea breeding programs for its fragrance. &quot;Rhododendron atlanticum&quot; is a non-toxic species sometimes available in the nursery trade. This species is often used in landscaping because its fragrance attracts pollinators such as bees, butterflies and hummingbirds as well as it being a showy flower. This species has a medium tolerance to drought and fires, and requires cold stratification for germination. &quot;Rhododendron atlanticum&quot; produce pinkish-purple flowers in early spring.

== Hybridization ==
The two species that create a hybrid form as a response to herbivory from leaf beetles are &quot;Rhododendron periclymenoides&quot; and &quot;R. atlanticum&quot;. Candy Lights is an ornamental hybrid that uses &quot;R. atlanticum&quot; as a parent plant.

<doc id="474613" wikidata="Q4119879" url="?curid=474613" title="Trex (card game)">
<text>Trex, pronounced Tricks or Trix, and also known as Ticks, is a four-player Middle Eastern card game mainly played in the Levant region (Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Palestine). Similar to European games like Barbu, Herzeln, Kein Stich or Quodlibet, Trex is a compendium game in which there are four rounds with each round consisting of five games. Each cycle is called a &quot;kingdom&quot; in reference to the fact that in each cycle one player (the King) determines which contract to play in each of the five games.

==Players, cards and deal==

Trex is played by four people using a standard international 52-card pack without jokers. The cards in each suit rank from high to low: A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2. Deal and play are counter-clockwise.

To begin the session, the cards are shuffled, cut (by player to left of dealer) and dealt out to the four players, one at a time, so that each player has 13 cards. It does not matter who deals first, but the player who is dealt the 7 of hearts in this first deal is said to &quot;own the kingdom.&quot; This player chooses which contract to be played each hand, and is also the dealer for the next four deals. During his or her &quot;kingdom&quot; a player may choose to play any contract based on his or her cards. There is no rule for playing the contracts in a set order, and there are 120 possible combinations of contract orders.

After the first dealer has played all five contracts, the kingdom passes to the player to his right, and so on. In some variations the game passes to the right first two times, then to the person opposite of the second player then to the remaining player. Each of these players, during their kingdoms, must deal five times, choosing a different contract each time, without repetition. After the four kingdoms are complete, 20 deals have been played, every player has chosen every contract once: the game is over.

==The five contracts==

Four of the five contracts are trick-taking games in which the aim is to avoid taking tricks, or particular cards. The dealer always leads to the first trick, and the winner of each trick leads to the next. Players must follow suit if they can, and the highest card of the suit led collects the trick.

===King of hearts or &quot;roi de coeurs&quot;===

The player who takes the trick containing the king of hearts loses 75 points in standard setting. When the contract is announced, the player who has the king of hearts has the option of revealing it to the other players and in doing so doubling its value. Hence, this process is called &quot;doubling&quot;. If the player doubling the card fails, and collects it, he or she is reduced 75 points. Oppositely, If another player collects it when it is &quot;doubled&quot; he or she is reduced 150 points (double the standard value) and the player who originally had it gets 75 points.

One common strategy followed in the pursuit of forcing the card&#x27;s holder to collect it him or herself is for players to purposely lead hearts when possible.

If this contract is chosen and a player holds either the king of hearts alone, the ace of hearts alone, or the king of hearts and the Ace of hearts, he or she may request that the hand be re-dealt. This is because such a player would most probably collect the card, which would be unfair for him or her! The player making the appeal should show all his or her cards to the other players. If this happens the replayed contract does not have to be King of Hearts.

===Diamonds===

Each card of the diamond suit taken in a trick costs 10 points off the running total of the collecting player. In some variations the collected diamonds are kept face up in front of the players taking them so that everyone can see which diamonds have been taken, and/or played, although this is not the standard method of play. Normally they are not shown.

===Girls or &quot;femmes&quot;===

Each queen taken in a trick costs the collecting player 25 points. Queens are stored face up in front of the winner of the trick in which they were played. Queens can also be doubled, causing the player who collects a doubled queen to be reduced 50 points and the one giving it to gain 25 points. If a doubled queen is collected it has a card placed over its half. Among some Trex players this is called &quot;a blanket to keep her warm&quot;. If a normal queen is collected it has a card placed under its half. This is called &quot;a pillow for her head&quot;.

===Collections/ &quot;slaps&quot;/&quot;slapping&quot;/&quot;lutoosh&quot;===

Each trick taken costs the collecting player 15 points.

===Trex or trix===

Despite its name, this is the only contract that is not a trick-taking game, but a game of the Card Domino family. Players try to get rid of their cards as soon as they can by playing them to a layout, which begins with the jacks, and continues upwards in each suit to the ace and downwards to the two. The dealer begins and play continues counter-clockwise. Players must play one card if they can. Legal plays are: any jack, or any card that is one rank higher or lower than a card that has already been played. If a player is unable to play, they pass. The first player who runs out of cards scores plus 200 points. The others continue playing and the second scores plus 150 points, the third plus 100 points and the last gets plus 50 points.

If Trex is announced, any player who holds four twos or three twos and the three of the fourth suit can require the cards to be thrown in. The cards are shuffled and redealt, and the dealer can choose any contract that he has not already played (including Trex).

The game is repeated if a suit is closed without all jacks on the table

==Scoring==

After 20 deals, when all four players have completed their kingdoms by choosing all five contracts, the game is over. The final scores indicate the result - the players with positive scores win by that amount, and the players with negative scores lose similarly.

The total points available in the five contracts are -75, -130, -100, -195, +500, so the total scores at the end of each kingdom and at the end of the whole game are always zero.

==Tactics==

=== Common tactics ===

* Open with the suit with the fewest cards, try to run out.
* Keep track how many cards are out of your hand from each suit, and how many have been played.
* Remember what suit each player opened with.
* When someone plays a very low rank (2&#x27;s and 3&#x27;s), that usually means they ran out, or almost ran out of that suit.
* When playing partners, it might be a good idea for one partner to keep one high value card of a suit the other partner still has, so they can hand them the game when they are stuck.
* Except in very rare cases, players should not play a suit that every other player ran out of (called tlata&#x27;shawy meaning thirteen).
* Tafreesh, is forcing an opponent to collect a trick when all the remaining cards in their hands are either very high or tlata&#x27;shawy, in that case they hand a trick to anyone else.
* If a player have a good hand for multiple contracts, the player should choose in this order of importance: Trex, king of hearts, queens, slaps, diamonds.
** Queens can be more important than king in partners if two queens can be doubled.

=== King of hearts ===
Generally, the king of hearts is an important game, and the easiest to pick if the player has the right cards. One should choose this contract and double the king if they (in order of risk):

# Have 5 or more hearts including the king (protected king)
# Have 3-4 hearts of high value (the ace and queen are helpful) including the king, with 2 or less cards of at least one other suit.
# Have 3-4 hearts including the king with 1 or less cards of at least one other suit.

If the player doesn&#x27;t have the king of hearts, they should choose this contracts only if all other contracts available are extremely risky, because they might lose the chance to double the king and give an opponent the chance to control the game. It&#x27;s important to have a high number (4 or more) of high value hearts. It&#x27;s also preferable to have low values (2&#x27;s and 3&#x27;s) in the other suits, to avoid collecting the king of hearts on a trick of another suit.

==== Strategy ====
If a player has the king, one tactic is to start with the suit with the fewest cards until they run out, they can then play the king on that suit if their opponent will collect it.

If a player has 7 or more high value hearts including the king, they can almost guarantee success by leading with hearts until everyone runs out, then play all their high value cards from the other suits, before handing the game to another player with a low value card.

If a player counts cards correctly, they may be able to lead with the king when an opponent has the ace alone in their hand.

When playing partners and the king is on a player&#x27;s left, they can try not to play hearts until their partner does so, making sure they don&#x27;t have the ace in their hand. If they do, the first partner should play a suit they ran out of to let them get rid of the ace.

If one partner opened with a card other than 2, and that suit was played one time only, the other partner should play a high rank of that suit to make sure their partner runs out before wasting their low rank card.

If a player only has high cards of the suit their partner has run out of, they should keep playing that suit (high to low) until their partner runs out of another one, or an opponent is forced to collect.

If a player knows for a fact that the player on their right has the ace of hearts, and that the player&#x27;s partner has the king, it could be possible to lead with hearts to force them to play the ace.

=== Queens ===
The strategy for picking queens is the same for the king of hearts, except it applies to all suits. It is preferable to be able to double at least two queens when a player pick this contract, but not necessary. Queens in a player&#x27;s hand that they cannot double can at least assure that no one else will double them, and the player can mediate the loss from collecting one with a doubled queen given to an opponent.

==== Strategy ====
Same as the king of hearts except it applies to all suits. Also, the player has to pay to keep track of both kings and aces of each suit.

It is always preferable for a player to collect a non-doubled queen if they can, to make their opponent to collect a doubled queen.

Queens is usually an economic game, where the player has to weight their wins and losses.

Tafreesh (see above) is a very common strategy in this contract, and especially useful when a player has a queen with a lot of protection of low ranks.

=== Diamonds ===
Diamonds is the go-to contract when a player has no other contracts to pick, since each diamond is worth -10 and usually they are distributed between multiple players. A perfect diamond hand is a hand with a lot of low rank diamonds (especially a 2), and generally low rank cards of other suits (although with a hand like that it might be preferable to pick slaps because it&#x27;s a riskier game). The player can also pick the game if they have only one or two very low rank diamonds. Having another suit with one or two cards is also important, especially if the player has a high run of diamonds.

==== Strategy ====
Generally similar to other trick games. Keep an eye out for high rank diamonds and avoid playing tlata&#x27;shawy. 

It&#x27;s also a good idea for a player to keep at least one high-mid rank diamond to allow their partner to hand them the game if they are stuck. 

If a player is the one who picked diamonds, it&#x27;s preferable for them to wait for their partner to lead with diamonds, because usually that means that the player is the one with low rank diamonds.

If allowed, it is preferable to open with a diamond card if the player has only one or two mid-rank diamonds.

=== Slaps ===
Slaps are picked if a player has generally low cards, and preferably a suit with one or two cards, so they can run out and get rid of their high rank cards.

If playing partners, a player should not pick slaps if they only have low ranks as their partner&#x27;s hand may also have a low value, and keeping a high card will allow them to give hand the game to the player.

==== Strategy ====
When an early game trick has low or medium ranks, the player can leave it. This is preferable, unless their partner is the one collecting it.

In late game, if a player has counted the cards correctly, they can take a trick with a high card and play a low card after, giving it back to an opponent, usually resulting in tafreesh.

Sometimes it&#x27;s better for a player to lead with high cards so they will not collect tricks in the late game, as above.

One player might play a suit that their partner ran out of in order to let them get rid of their high ranks. Here, the first player may have to play tlata&#x27;shawy. This is a risky strategy, but can help when the player want to help their partner avoid tafreesh.

=== Trex ===
Trex is usually the most important and decisive contract (especially in partners), and it&#x27;s the only positive score game (outside of doubling). Trex favors higher value hands, especially queens through aces. Also having mid rank cards of the same suit in order (e.g. 4, 5, 6 of hearts) is very helpful. Having 2&#x27;s is detrimental, especially in partners where a player has to reveal them. Furthermore, having no cards of a suit, or having only a queen or higher of a suit will make the game significantly harder, as the player cannot control the game and will have to play cards for their opponents. Having a lonely jack, and no other jacks, is also detrimental because the player will have to play it immediately. On the other hand, having 10, J, Q of a suit gives the player the best start, because the player will not affect the game, forcing other players to play the jacks that the player needs.

==== Strategy ====
Generally, the player should play the cards they need (based on their 2s and their partner&#x27;s), followed by non-risk cards (aces, 2s, and cards that where the player has the successor), then low risk cards (queens, kings, 3s, and cards where a successor with one card separation), then other cards.

When the player forced to play cards for their opponent, they should try to focus on only one suit, preferably the one they have the most of.

Sometimes, the player might have to keep a card that they or their partner need in their hand, to force a player to play another card that they also need.

If someone is passing, and a player has to play a card for an opponent (especially a 3), they should try to play cards for the one passing. That way, they make sure that the others will be forced to play cards which benefit the player.

It is helpful to see how many cards each player has before playing a card in the late game.

In partners, 2nd and 3rd are the same as 1st and 4th, so players do not need to risk the game if they not sure that their partner will be first.

The following are some common Trex variations:

* Some play that in the first three contracts, a player who is unable to follow suit must discard a penalty card (king of hearts in contract 1, diamond in contract 2, queen in contract 3) if they have one.
* Some players interchange the scores for diamonds (each diamond costs 10 points) and slapping (each trick costs 15 points).
* Some players reverse all the scores, giving positive points for the first four contracts and negative points for Trex. The object is then to have as low a score as possible at the end. Clearly this makes no difference to the way the game is played.
* Some play the contracts in a different order. For example: trix, girls 3asba, king of hearts, diamonds, collection.
* Trex is sometimes played as a partnership game, partners sitting opposite each other. The game is played the same way - each player gets a turn to choose contracts. There are two differences: (1) in the contract &quot;Trex&quot;, after each player has had their first turn, all players must put any 2&#x27;s that they hold face up on the table, so that everyone knows who has them and (2) scores are kept in terms of teams not individuals.
* It can be agreed in advance that when (King of Hearts) or (Girls) is announced, any player who holds a penalty card can place it face up on the table before the first lead. In this case the player who takes the card in a trick loses twice as much (-150 for the king of hearts, -50 for a queen) and the player who held the card scores +75 for the king of hearts or +25 for a queen.
* Trex Complex is a recent variant in which a dealer can play two or more of the first four contracts at the same time. In this case all the penalty cards and tricks from the contracts being played are scored in that deal. The number of deals is reduced accordingly - for example if a dealer starts by playing Diamonds, Girls and Collection together, then he has only two more deals, which must be King of Hearts and Trex (in either order). This variation is not recommended since it increases the luck factor - a player who is fortunate to deal himself a hand full of low cards can get a huge score by playing contracts 1-4 all at once.
* In Palestine and Jordan Trix complex refers only to the game when all four contracts are played at once while Trix is separate. When combining contracts according to desire of the king of the game, the game is called Trix Combination.

<text>LightWave 3D is a 3D computer graphics program developed by LightWave Digital. It has been used in films, television, motion graphics, digital matte painting, visual effects, video game development, product design, architectural visualizations, virtual production, music videos, pre-visualizations and advertising.

==Overview==
LightWave is a software package used for rendering 3D images, both animated and static. It includes a fast rendering engine that supports such advanced features as realistic reflection, radiosity, caustics, and 999 render nodes. The 3D modeling component supports both polygon modeling and subdivision surfaces. The animation component has features such as inverse and forward kinematics for character animation, particle systems and dynamics. Programmers can expand LightWave&#x27;s capabilities using an included SDK which offers Python, LScript (a proprietary scripting language) and C language interfaces.

==History==

In 1988, Allen Hastings created a rendering and animation program called &quot;VideoScape 3D&quot;, and his friend Stuart Ferguson created a complementary 3D modeling program called &quot;Modeler&quot;, both sold by Aegis Software. NewTek planned to incorporate VideoScape and Modeler into its video editing suite, Video Toaster. Originally intended to be called &quot;NewTek 3D Animation System for the Amiga&quot;, Hastings later came up with the name &quot;LightWave 3D&quot;, inspired by two contemporary high-end 3D packages: Intelligent Light and Wavefront. In 1990, the Video Toaster suite was released, incorporating LightWave 3D, and running on the Amiga computer.

LightWave 3D has been available as a standalone application since 1994, and version 9.3 runs on both Mac OS X and Windows platforms. Starting with the release of version 9.3, the Mac OS X version has been updated to be a Universal Binary.

The last known standalone revision for the Amiga was LightWave 5.0, released in 1995. Shortly after the release of the first PC version, NewTek discontinued the Amiga version, citing the platform&#x27;s uncertain future. Versions were soon released for the DEC Alpha, Silicon Graphics (SGI), and Macintosh platforms.

LightWave was used to create special effects for the television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot;, &quot;Lost&quot;, and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. The program was also utilized in the production of &quot;Titanic&quot; as well as &quot;Avatar&quot;, &quot;Sin City&quot;, and &quot;300&quot;. The short film &quot;405&quot; was produced by two artists from their homes using LightWave. In the Finnish Star Trek parody &quot;Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning&quot;, most of the visual effects were done in LightWave by Finnish filmmaker Samuli Torssonen, who produced the VFX work for the feature film &quot;Iron Sky&quot;. The film &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot; was made entirely in LightWave 6 and messiah:Studio.

In 2007, the first feature film to be 3D animated entirely by one person made its debut, &quot;Flatland the Film&quot; by Ladd Ehlinger Jr. It was animated entirely in LightWave 3D 7.5 and 8.0.

In its ninth version, the market for LightWave ranges from hobbyists to high-end deployment in video games, television and cinema. NewTek shipped a 64-bit version of LightWave 3D as part of the fifth free update of LightWave 3D 8, and was featured in a keynote speech by Bill Gates at WinHEC 2005.

On February 4, 2009, NewTek announced &quot;LightWave CORE&quot; its next-generation 3D application via a streamed live presentation to 3D artists around the world. It featured a highly customizable and modernized user interface, Python scripting integration that offered realtime code and view previews, an updated file format based on the industry standard Collada format, substantial revisions to its modeling technologies and a realtime iterative viewport renderer. It was planned to be the first LightWave product to be available on the Linux operating system. However, on June 23, 2011, CORE was cancelled as a standalone product and NewTek announced that the CORE advancements would become part of the ongoing LightWave platform, starting with LightWave 10 (which was originally LightWave HC, intended to be a transitional software system comprising the classical Layout and Modeler applications during the initial stages of CORE, in order to supply compatibility with the existing toolset for LightWave).

On December 30, 2010, NewTek shipped LightWave 10. It added an interactive viewport renderer (VPR), interactive stereoscopic camera rigs, linear color-space workflow, real time interactive physical teleoperation input (Virtual Studio Tools), and data interchange upgrades.

On February 20, 2012, NewTek began shipping LightWave 11 Software, the latest version of its professional 3D modeling, animation, and rendering software. LightWave 11 incorporates many new features, such as instancing, flocking and fracturing tools, flexible Bullet Dynamics, Pixologic Zbrush support, and more. LightWave 11 is used for all genres of 3D content creation-from film and broadcast visual effects production, to architectural visualization, and game design.

On January 31, 2013, NewTek shipped LightWave 11.5 which debuted a new modular rigging system called Genoma. The flocking system was reworked, gaining predator and prey behaviors. The bullet dynamics system was improved to include soft body dynamics, wind forces and to react to bone deformations. Interlinks to After Effects and ZBrush (via GoZ) were added as well. New tools, based on a new experimental subsystem were added to Modeler. It was originally thought that this subsystem would allow further enhancements to Modeler, but disclosures by a developer in the main user forums (since removed by moderators) indicated that this approach had been too problematic and another avenue was being considered to enable Modeler to evolve. FiberFX, the hair/fur system in LightWave, also saw improvements with the 11.5 release, to work with soft bodies and to also directly support curves from Modeler for guiding hair. Additionally, braid and twist support was added, to ease creation of complex hairstyles.

On November 1, 2013, NewTek shipped LightWave 11.6. This release brought a new animation tool, spline control, along with improvements to ray casting (to enable items in the scene to be precisely positioned on a surface, with optional offset. nVidia&#x27;s CgFX was also implemented, albeit via the legacy shader system. STL support was added to enable output suitable for 3D printers. The virtual studio system was also enhanced to support a LightWave 3D group-authored add-on called NevronMotion, enabling direct motion capture (full body and facial) using consumer devices such as the Kinect (on Windows only) and re-targeting via a simplified user interface. A simplified Python system was made available for the Modeler environment and for common functions. The timeline for Layout support via this simplified system has not been disclosed. Alembic support was also introduced. Since the release of 11.6, two minor patches have been released to resolve software issues (11.6.1 and 11.6.2). In early May 2014, 11.6.3 was released to address a licensing system limitation.

On November 24, 2014, NewTek released Lightwave 2015. The release upgraded Bullet physics integration (constraints, motors, dynamics affecting bones), Genoma rigging automation plug-in with scripting, edge rendering, and the dynamic object parenting workflow. It also added a plate perspective matching tool, and Importance sampling to Global illumination. The retail price was lowered by a third.

On January 1, 2018, NewTek released Lightwave 2018. Features include: Physically Based Rendering System, Render &amp; Light Buffers, New Volumetric Engine, OpenVDB Support, New Lighting Architecture, Surface Editor - Material Nodes &amp; Surface Preview, Virtual Reality Camera, Modifier Stack &amp; Nodal Modifiers, New Cel Shader &amp; Enhanced Edge Rendering, More Integrated FiberFX, Layout-based Parametric Shapes, Physically Based OpenGL, &amp; a Noise Reduction Filter. New Modeler Features include: &quot;A &#x27;Layout View&#x27; viewport shows the current camera view from Layout. In addition, LightWave 2018 Modeler provides new fully interactive tools including Lattice, Smoothing, Array and Spline Bridge to speed up your modeling.&quot;

In January 2019, LightWave 2019 introduced new integration tools with Unreal Engine, animatable mesh sculpting and painting in Layout, new UV mapping and UDIM tools (as well as support for smoothing groups) in Modeler, improved FBX interchange, shading model customization tools, new shape primitives, OpenVDB creation, shading/rendering enhancements, and workflow/UI improvements.

==Modeler and Layout==
LightWave is composed of separate programs, primarily Modeler and Layout. Each program provides a dedicated workspace for specific tasks. When these two programs are running simultaneously, a program called Hub is used to synchronize data between the two.

Modeler, as the name implies, includes all of the modeling features used to create the 3D models, while Layout includes features to arrange the 3D models, animate, and render them. Layout offers ray tracing, global illumination, and render output parameters.

This separation is unique among 3D computer graphics packages, which commonly integrate their modeler and renderer. NewTek asserts dedicating workspaces for specific tasks creates an arguably more efficient 3D production workflow. A long-standing debate in the LightWave user community has consisted of whether or not to integrate Modeler and Layout into a single program. In response to this, NewTek has begun an integration process by including several basic modeling tools with Layout.

There is also a command-line network rendering engine named Screamernet which can be used to distribute rendering tasks across a large number of networked computers. This is used to reduce the overall time that it takes to render a single project by having the computers each rendering a part of the whole project in parallel. Screamernet includes all the features of the rendering engine that is integrated in Layout but without an interactive user interface. LightWave supports 999 render nodes natively.

==Features==

===Dynamics===
LightWave provides dynamics physics systems supporting hard and soft body motion, deformation, constraint, motorization, environments, and particles. It interacts with 3D object models, bones, and hair (FiberFX). LightWave includes both Bullet and legacy proprietary (comprising ClothFX, SoftFX, HardFX, ParticleFX emitter, wind, collision, and gravity) dynamics engines.

===Hypervoxels===
Hypervoxels are a means to render different particle animation effects. Different modes of operation have the ability to generate appearances that mimic:

*Metaballs for objects like water or mercury, including reflection or refraction surface settings
*Sprites which are able to reproduce effects like fire or flocking birds
*Volume shading for simulating clouds or fog type effects.

===Material shaders===
LightWave comes with a nodal texture editor that comes with a collection of special-purpose material shaders. Some of the types of surface for which these shaders have been optimized include:

*general-purpose subsurface scattering materials for materials like wax or plastics
*realistic skin, including subsurface scattering and multiple skin layers
*metallic, reflective, materials using energy conservation algorithms
*transparent, refractive materials including accurate total internal reflection algorithms
*dielectric shading to render the behavior of light rays passing through materials with differing refractive indices

===Nodes===
NewTek expanded LightWave&#x27;s parameter setting capabilities with a node graph architecture (Node Editor) for LightWave 9. This Editor enabled broad hierarchical parameter setting on top of its fixed and stack-based parameter setting support. Example node types include mathematical, script, gradient, sample, instance, group, and shader. Nodes are usable within the Surface Editor, Mesh Displacement, and Virtual Studio features. A node plug-in API was released for third party developers to add their own nodes.

A notable example of third-party node development is Denis Pontonnier&#x27;s Additional Nodes. These free nodes enable modifying images, renders, procedural textures, Hypervoxels, object motions, animation channels, and volumetric lights. Also they enable particles and other meshes to drive node parameters.

===Scripting===
LScript is one of LightWave&#x27;s scripting languages. It provides a comprehensive set of prebuilt functions you can use when scripting how LightWave behaves.

With LightWave 11, NewTek added Python support as an option for custom scripting.

===LightWave Plug-In SDK===
The SDK provides a set of C classes for writing native LightWave plug-ins.

==Licensing==
Prior to being made available as a stand-alone product in 1994, LightWave required the presence of a Video Toaster in an Amiga to run. Until version 11.0.3, LightWave licenses were bound to a hardware dongle (e.g. Safenet USB or legacy parallel port models). Without a dongle LightWave would operate in &quot;Discovery Mode&quot; which severely restricts functionality. One copy of LightWave supports distributed rendering of up to 999 nodes.

<doc id="474656" wikidata="Q726989" url="?curid=474656" title="George Orton">
<text>George Washington F. Orton (January 10, 1873 – June 24, 1958) was a Canadian middle and long-distance runner. In 1900, he became the first Canadian to win a medal at an Olympic Games. He won a bronze in the 400 metre hurdles, and then, forty-five minutes later, won the gold medal in the 2500 metre steeplechase. He was the first athlete with a disability to win an Olympic gold medal. At the University of Pennsylvania, for whom he competed while earning his Masters (MA in 1894) and Doctorate (Ph.D. in 1896) and completed his ability to speak 9 languages, he was captain of Penn&#x27;s track and field team in 1896 and was a founder and captain of its ice hockey team in 1896–1897, and was known as &quot;The Father of Philadelphia Hockey&quot;. He won seventeen U.S. National Track and Field titles.

== Early life and injury ==
Orton was born in Strathroy, Ontario, the son of Oliver Henry Orton, a labourer, and his wife, Mary Ann Irvine. Orton was paralyzed when he fell out of a tree at the age of three. The fall caused a blood clot on his brain, and severely damaged his right arm. He was later diagnosed with spinal meningitis. He could not walk until age ten, but fully regained his mobility around age twelve.

Orton did his undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto, earning a B.A. in 1893 in Romance Languages. He was then offered a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania in 1893 to complete his Masters (1894) and Ph.D. (1896), at the age of twenty-three.

== Running career ==
By the time he completed his Ph.D., Orton was the top middle-distance runner in the world. He won a then-record seventeen national titles in the United States, along with seven in Canada. Also at the British AAA Championships steepechase event, he won the title at the 1898 AAA Championships.

He won the U.S. one-mile championship six times, the two-mile steeplechase seven times, the Cross Country twice, the five-mile run and the ten-mile run. While a student at the University of Toronto in 1892, Orton set a mile record of 4:21.8 which lasted for forty-two years. In total, he won 131 races, including a staggering thirty-three National and International championships.

==Olympic gold medal==
Orton&#x27;s competed at the 1900 Summer Olympics, held in Paris, where he represented the United States. He competed in three official Olympic events: two steeplechase competitions and the 400m hurdles. He also competed in several other events that were &quot;handicap&quot; races and not recognized by the IOC. Orton had to give up either time or distance to other runners in these events, because of his success on the track. He won a bronze medal in the 400m hurdles (the last of which was a water jump). Just forty-five minutes later, suffering from an intestinal virus, Orton won the gold medal in the 2500m steeplechase, setting a world record of 7:34.4. The next day, still ill, he placed fifth in the 4000m steeplechase.

==Father of Philadelphia Hockey==

Orton was known as &quot;The Father of Philadelphia Hockey&quot;. He introduced ice hockey to Philadelphians in 1896 while at Penn, and captained the first team there. Citing a lack of a proper facility, Orton was responsible for the building of the first indoor ice arena in Philadelphia, and the popularity of the sport took off from there. Orton founded the Philadelphia Hockey League in 1897, and the following year formed the Quaker City Hockey Club which played in the highly-competitive American Amateur Hockey League. From 1920 to 1922, Orton coached the Penn Varsity hockey team. Years earlier, while attending the University of Toronto, he helped form the first hockey team there, and also played soccer for the &#x27;Varsity&#x27; team in the Toronto Football League. Orton was chosen to play on Canada&#x27;s team that played against a U.S. all-star team from Fall River, Mass. on June 14, 1891. In 1910 he played centre half for the Philadelphia all-stars against the New York all-stars In Haverford, Pennsylvania, and in 1923, at the age of fifty, he was playing soccer for Merchantville in the Philadelphia league. He was a member of the Merion and Belmont Cricket Clubs of Philadelphia, the New York Athletic Club, the Pennsylvania Athletic Club, the University of Pennsylvania Track Club and was the secretary of the Rose Tree Fox Hunting Club of Media, Pa. for forty-three years. Orton was also a member of the American Academy of Poets, and spoke nine languages fluently.

==Track coach==
Orton took part in the first Penn Relay Carnival in 1895, and later became the track coach at Penn, taking over after the death of Mike Murphy. He wrote the definitive training manual for runners, &quot;Distance and Cross Country Running&quot; in 1903, and also wrote a book about the history of Penn Athletics. He was the manager of the Penn Relays from 1919 to 1925, and helped nurture the event in its early years, making it the greatest annual track and field competition in the world. He was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame and the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame, as well as the University of Pennsylvania Hall of Fame and the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame. His other books included the Bob Hunt series aimed at young men or boys who enjoy the outdoors. In 1903, Orton co-founded Camp Tecumseh, in Meredith, New Hampshire. A decade later, he founded Camp Iroquois, the first overnight athletic camp for girls and young women.

Orton was competitive in soccer (football) and became a writer on sports and running. In 1911 Orton teamed up with Thomas Cahill to write a guide to association football, or soccer.

Orton was secretary of the Rose Tree Hunt Club.

==Death and legacy==

Orton was named to the Helm Foundation and University of Pennsylvania Hall of Fame.

He died on June 24, 1958, in Laconia, New Hampshire, at age 85.

A book about Orton, &quot;The Greatest Athlete (you&#x27;ve never heard of)&quot;, was published in 2019.

<doc id="474666" wikidata="Q5813830" url="?curid=474666" title="Ted Horn">
<text>Eylard Theodore Horn (February 27, 1910 – October 10, 1948) was an American racing driver. Widely considered one of the greatest racers of his era, he was the first person in history to win the AAA National Championship three times consecutively, doing so in 1946, 1947 and 1948.

== Early life and career ==

Eylard Theodore Horn was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. Horn&#x27;s family moved several times during his childhood, finally settling in Los Angeles. At 15 years of age he found work at the Los Angeles Times newspaper.

On his way to work one day Horn was pulled over for speeding. Try as he might he could not get out of this situation easily. The policeman gave him a fairly unusual punishment for the infraction. The young man was to travel to a race track called San Jose Speedway where usually there were more cars than drivers, then find a willing car owner to let him drive. Once he got all the speed he had out of his system he could pick up his impounded car. Horn would heed the advice of the policeman and would eventually return to pick up his car. But he found a new passion in auto racing and would never &quot;get the speed he had out of his system.&quot;

When Horn began his racing career in earnest at a California race track called Legion Ascot Speedway he found he had much to learn as he was usually the slowest driver on the track. Eventually a few of the drivers gave him pointers on how to pick up his lap times which started to help develop his driving style. He suffered a serious racing accident which broke his foot and burned his back and kept him on the mend for several weeks. At the urging of his parents he promised to abandon the sport. He fully intended to abide by his parents wishes but after three years he began racing again.

Horn steadily improved to the point he finished a close second in a race to Indianapolis 500 winner Louis Meyer. Meyer was impressed with young Ted Horn, who felt he now needed to travel to the mid-western and eastern regions of the United States where there were more race tracks and opportunities for a young race driver.

== Championship car career ==

In 1934 in preparation for the Indianapolis 500 Horn practiced in a car called the Mick Special. However, he did not feel comfortable with the car and decided against trying to qualify it. Throughout that summer he campaigned a sprint car on a rigorous schedule once again in the east and midwest. He was successful enough to attract the attention of Harry Miller. Preston Tucker was putting together an ambitious effort with Miller and the Ford Motor Company for the 1935 Indianapolis 500. When asked by Miller, Horn accepted a ride in one of the new Miller Ford V8 cars. He did make the field for the 1935 Indianapolis 500. Unfortunately a flaw in the design of the car would eventually result in the steering gear in the car to eventually freeze up and the car being impossible to steer. He dropped out of the race after 145 laps, most of which was spent fighting the steering problem.

After his first Indianapolis 500, Horn felt that he failed to make an impression. Former driver turned car owner Harry Hartz felt otherwise about the young driver and thought that he did an excellent job of driving under difficult circumstances. Hartz was impressed enough to offer Horn a chance to drive his car in the 1936 Indianapolis 500, which he gladly accepted. Hartz, consistent finisher in his years driving the Indianapolis 500, took Horn under his wing. The combination Hartz and Horn was immediately a potent one as Horn would finish second on his first race with Hartz. He had two more Indianapolis 500 starts with the Hartz machine and finished third and fourth respectively.

Horn continued to race with moderate success through the 1930s, with second, third and fourth places at the Indianapolis 500 and placing well in the championship standings.

He volunteered for World War II service but was rejected on the basis of his racing injuries. After the cessation of hostilities, racing began again on a limited basis in 1945, and Horn won all seven races he entered that year. Further success came his way in the three subsequent years, giving him the National Championship in 1946, 1947 and 1948; this was the first three-time win. He never won the Indianapolis 500, but achieved nine straight top-four finishes. He also started on the pole in 1947.

== Death ==

During the season finale of the 1948 AAA Championship Car season, with Horn having already clinched his third successive championship, in Du Quoin, Illinois on October 10, 1948, he was involved in a serious accident during the second lap. He was taken to the hospital alive but died a short time later. He was 38. The AAA Championship Car race (now USAC Silver Crown) is known as the Ted Horn 100 in his memory.

== Awards and honors ==

Horn has been inducted into the following halls of fame:
* Auto Racing Hall of Fame (1964)
* Eastern Motorsports Press Association Hall of Fame (1987)
* National Sprint Car Hall of Fame (1991)

<doc id="474670" wikidata="Q324640" url="?curid=474670" title="Charismatic movement">
<text>The charismatic movement in Christianity is a movement within established or mainstream denominations to adopt beliefs and practices of Charismatic Christianity, with an emphasis on baptism with the Holy Spirit, and the use of spiritual gifts (&quot;charismata&quot;). It has affected most denominations in the United States, and has spread widely across the world.

The movement is deemed to have begun in 1960 in Anglicanism (Episcopal Church) and spread to other mainstream Protestant denominations, including American Protestant both Lutherans and Presbyterians by 1962, and to Roman Catholicism by 1967. Methodists became involved in the charismatic movement in the 1970s.

The movement was not initially influential in evangelical churches. Although this changed in the 1980s in the so-called Third Wave, the charismatic movement was often expressed in the formation of separate evangelical churches such as the Vineyard Movement—neo-charismatic organisations that mirrored the establishment of Pentecostal churches. Many traditional evangelical churches remain opposed to the movement and teach a cessationist theology.

==History==

The classic Pentecostalism movement usually traces its origin to the early twentieth century, with the ministry of Charles F. Parham and the subsequent ministry of William Joseph Seymour and the Azusa Street Revival. Its unique doctrine involved a dramatic encounter with God, termed baptism with the Holy Spirit. Some believed that speaking in tongues was evidence for having had this experience.

Before 1955 the religious mainstream did not embrace Pentecostal doctrines. If a church member or clergyman openly expressed such views, they would (either voluntarily or involuntarily) separate from their existing denomination. However, by the 1960s many of the characteristic teachings were gaining acceptance among Christians within mainline Protestant denominations. 

The charismatic movement represented a reversal of the previous pattern, as those influenced by Pentecostal spirituality chose to remain in their original denominations. The popularization and broader acceptance of charismatic teachings and ideas are linked to the Healing Revival that occurred from 1946 to 1958. The revivalists of the time, including William Branham, Oral Roberts, and A. A. Allen, held large interdenominational meetings which emphasized the gifts of the spirit. This global revival led to greater awareness and acceptance of Pentecostal teachings and practices.

The high church wing of the American Episcopal Church became the first traditional ecclesiastical organization to be affected internally by the new movement. The beginning of the charismatic movement is usually dated to Sunday, April 3, 1960, when Dennis J. Bennett, rector of St Mark&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Van Nuys, California recounted his Pentecostal experience to his parish; he repeated it on the next two Sundays, including Easter (April 17), during which many of his congregation also shared the experience of spirit. He was forced to resign. 

The resulting controversy and press coverage spread an awareness of the emerging charismatic movement. The movement grew to embrace other mainline churches, where clergy began receiving and publicly announcing their Pentecostal experiences. These clergy began holding meetings for seekers and healing services, which included praying over and anointing of the sick. The charismatic movement reached Lutherans and Presbyterians in 1962. 

The Catholic Charismatic Renewal began in 1967 at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Methodists became involved in the charismatic movement in the 1970s.

The charismatic movement led to the founding of many covenant communities, such as Sword of the Spirit and Word of God. They are a force of ecumenism in that they have members from many major Christian denominations, such as Catholics, Lutherans, Anglicans, Reformed and Methodists, who live and pray together.

Despite the fact that Pentecostals tend to share more in common with evangelicals than with either Roman Catholics or non-evangelical wings of the church, the charismatic movement was not initially influential among evangelical churches. C. Peter Wagner traces the spread of the charismatic movement within evangelicalism to around 1985. He termed this movement the Third Wave of the Holy Spirit. The Third Wave has expressed itself through the formation of churches and denomination-like organizations. These groups are referred to as &quot;neo-charismatic&quot; and are distinct from the charismatic movement of the historic Christian churches. The Vineyard Movement and the British New Church Movement exemplify Third Wave or neo-charismatic organizations.

==Beliefs==
Charismatic Christians believe in an experience of baptism with the Holy Spirit and that spiritual gifts (Greek , from , &#x27;grace&#x27;) of the Holy Spirit as described in the New Testament are available to contemporary Christians through the infilling or baptism of the Holy Spirit, with or without the laying on of hands. 

The charismatic movement holds that Baptism in the Holy Spirit is the &quot;sovereign action of God, which usually occurs when someone with a disposition of surrender and docility, prays for a fresh outpouring of the Holy Spirit in his or her life.&quot; Additionally, &quot;baptism in the Holy Spirit unleashes the Holy Spirit that is already present within us, by revitalizing the graces we received in the sacrament of Baptism.&quot; Baptism with the Holy Spirit &quot;equips and inspires the individual for service, for mission, for discipleship and for life.&quot; Rev. Brenton Cordeiro teaches that those who have received Baptism with the Holy Spirit &quot;testify that the experience brought them to a new awareness of the reality and presence of Jesus Christ in their lives [as well as] a new hunger for the Word of God, the Sacraments and were filled with a renewed desire for holiness.&quot; 

Although the Bible lists many gifts from God through his Holy Spirit, there are nine specific gifts listed in 1 Corinthians 12:8–10 that are supernatural in nature and are the focus of and distinguishing feature of the charismatic movement: word of wisdom, word of knowledge, faith, gifts of healing, miraculous powers, prophecy, distinguishing between spirits, speaking in different tongues (languages), and interpretation of tongues.

While Pentecostals and charismatics share these beliefs, there are differences. Many in the charismatic movement deliberately distanced themselves from Pentecostalism for cultural and theological reasons. Foremost among theological reasons is the tendency of many Pentecostals to insist that speaking in tongues is always the initial physical sign of receiving Spirit baptism. Although specific teachings will vary by denomination, charismatics generally believe that the Holy Spirit has already been present in a person from the time of regeneration and prefer to call subsequent encounters with the Holy Spirit by other names, such as &quot;being filled&quot;. In contrast to Pentecostals, charismatics tend to accept a range of supernatural experiences (such as prophecy, miracles, healing, or &quot;physical manifestations of an altered state of consciousness&quot;) as evidence of having been baptized or filled with the Holy Spirit.

Pentecostals are also distinguished from the charismatic movement on the basis of style. Also, Pentecostals have traditionally placed a high value on evangelization and missionary work. Charismatics, on the other hand, have tended to see their movement as a force for revitalization and renewal within their own church traditions.

Cessationists argue these sign and revelatory gifts were manifested in the New Testament for a specific purpose, upon which once accomplished, these signs were withdrawn and no longer function. Cessationists support this claim by suggesting there was a rapid decline in reports of such gifts from the time of the Church Fathers onwards. Non-cessationists argue that testimonial claims of God doing signs, wonders and miracles can especially be found in the first three centuries of the church. Sacramental charismatics also point out that the means of distribution of charismatic gifts in the early church, was not limited to the laying on of hands of the canonical apostles, but was tethered to the receptivity of prayer connected to the sacrament of baptism. The Charismatic movement is based on a belief that these gifts are still available today.

==Denominations influenced==
===Anglicanism===
In the United States, Episcopalian priest Dennis Bennett is sometimes cited as one of the charismatic movement&#x27;s seminal influences. Bennett was the rector at St Mark&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Van Nuys, California, when he announced to the congregation in 1960 that he had received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Soon after this he ministered in Seattle, where he ran many workshops and seminars about the work of the Holy Spirit.

In the United Kingdom, Colin Urquhart, Michael Harper, David Watson, Trevor Dearing and others were in the vanguard of similar developments.

The Massey University conference in New Zealand in 1964 was attended by several Anglicans, including the Rev. Ray Muller. He invited Bennett to New Zealand in 1966, and played a leading role in developing and promoting the &quot;Life in the Spirit&quot; seminars. Other Charismatic movement leaders in New Zealand include Bill Subritzky.

As of the early 21st century, a &quot;charismatic evangelical&quot; wing or school of thought is commonly identified in the Church of England, contrasted with the conservative evangelical, Anglo-Catholic and other tendencies. An influential local church in this movement has been London&#x27;s Holy Trinity Brompton. Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury since 2013, has a background in charismatic evangelicalism.

===Lutheranism===
Larry Christenson, a Lutheran theologian based in San Pedro, California, did much in the 1960s and 1970s to interpret the charismatic movement for Lutherans. A very large annual conference was held in Minneapolis during those years. Some Lutheran charismatics in the U.S. formed the Alliance of Renewal Churches. 

Richard A. Jensen&#x27;s &quot;Touched by the Spirit&quot; (1974) played a major role in the Lutheran understanding to the charismatic movement. Other Lutheran charismatic leaders have been Harald Bredesen and Morris Vaagenes. In Finland the emergence of charismatic congregations has reversed, in some places, a decline in attendance among Lutheran congregations.

===Reformed===
In Congregational and Presbyterian churches which profess a traditionally Calvinist or Reformed theology, there are differing views regarding present-day continuation or cessation of the gifts (&quot;charismata&quot;) of the Spirit. Generally, however, Reformed charismatics distance themselves from renewal movements with tendencies that could be perceived as overemotional, such as Word of Faith, Toronto Blessing, Brownsville Revival and Lakeland Revival.

Prominent Reformed charismatic denominations are the Sovereign Grace Churches and the Every Nation Churches in the United States. In Great Britain the Newfrontiers churches and movement, founded by Terry Virgo, are among Reformed charismatic churches.

===Roman Catholicism===

In the United States the Catholic charismatic renewal was led by individuals such as Kevin Ranaghan and others at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana. Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, which was founded by the Congregation of the Holy Spirit, a Catholic religious community, began hosting charismatic revivals in 1977.

In a foreword to a 1983 book by Léon Joseph Cardinal Suenens, at that time the Pope&#x27;s delegate to the Catholic charismatic renewal, the then Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI), comments on the Post Second Vatican Council period stating,

and
In the Roman Catholic church, the movement became particularly popular in the Filipino, Korean, and Hispanic communities of the United States; in the Philippines; and in Latin America, mainly Brazil. Traveling priests and lay people associated with the movement often visit parishes and sing what are known as charismatic masses. It is thought to be the second-largest distinct sub-movement (some 120 million members) within global Catholicism, along with Traditional Catholicism.

A difficulty is the tendency for many charismatic Catholics to take on what others in their church might consider sacramental language and assertions of the necessity of baptism in the Holy Spirit as a universal act. There is little to distinguish such baptism from the sacrament of confirmation. In this regard, a Study seminar organized jointly in São Paulo by the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity and the Bishops Conference of Brazil raised these issues. Technically, among Catholics, the baptism of the Holy Spirit is neither the highest nor fullest manifestation of the Holy Spirit.

Thus baptism of the Spirit is one experience among many within Christianity (as are the extraordinary manifestations of the Spirit in the lives of the saints, notably St. Francis of Assisi and St. Teresa of Avila, who levitated). Because of this, Catholic charismatics do not hold this experience as dogmatically as do Pentecostals. 

Possibly, Padre Pio (now St. Pio) provides a modern-day Catholic example of this experience. Describing his confirmation, when he was 12 years old, Padre Pio said that he &quot;wept with consolation&quot; whenever he thought of that day because &quot;I remember what the Most Holy Spirit caused me to feel that day, a day unique and unforgettable in all my life! What sweet raptures the Comforter made me feel that day! At the thought of that day, I feel aflame from head to toe with a brilliant flame that burns, consumes, but gives no pain.&quot; In this experience, Padre Pio said he was made to feel God&#x27;s &quot;fullness and perfection.&quot; Thus a case can be made that he was &quot;baptized by the Spirit&quot; on his confirmation day in 1899. It was one spiritual experience among many that he would have.

The &quot;Compendium to the Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; states:
Recent Popes (John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul II and Francis) have all emphasised the importance of a deeper relationship with the Holy Spirit for all Catholics, and have spoken encouragingly to the Catholic charismatic renewal organisation on many occasions. On June 8, 2019, Pope Francis encouraged everyone in Charismatic Renewal &quot;to share baptism in the Holy Spirit with everyone in the Church.&quot; On June 6, 2019, the CHARIS (Catholic Charismatic Renewal International Service) service was officially inaugurated by Pope Francis. CHARIS has a &quot;public juridic personality&quot; within the Roman Catholic Church and has come into being as a direct initiative of the highest ecclesiastical authority, Pope Francis. The primary objectives of CHARIS are &quot;To help deepen and promote the grace of baptism in the Holy Spirit throughout the Church and to promote the exercise of charisms not only in Catholic Charismatic Renewal but also in the whole Church.&quot;

===Methodism===
In the Methodist tradition (inclusive of the holiness movement), baptism with the Holy Spirit traditionally refers to the second work of grace subsequent to the New Birth and is called entire sanctification, in which original sin is removed and the person is made perfect in love (Christian perfection). 

Entire sanctification, which may be received instantaneously or gradually, &quot;cleanses the heart of the recipient from all sin (I John 1:7, 9; Acts 15:8, 9), sets him apart and endows him with power for the accomplishment of all to which he is called (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:8).&quot;

When the Methodist movement was initiated, &quot;many individuals in London, Oxford and Bristol reported supernatural healings, visions, dreams, spiritual impressions, power in evangelizing, [and] extraordinary bestowments of wisdom&quot;. John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, &quot;firmly maintained that the Spiritual gifts are a natural consequence of genuine holiness and dwelling of God&#x27;s Spirit in a man.&quot; As such, Methodist Churches hold to the theological position of continuationism. With its history of promoting holiness and experiential faith, many Methodist congregations now engage in charismatic worship since the arrival of the charismatic movement to Methodism, though other Methodist connexions and their congregations eschew it. 

In the latter case, the Pentecostal doctrine of a third work of grace accompanied by glossolalia is condemned by some connexions in the Methodist tradition, such as the Pilgrim Holiness Church, which teaches that the state of Christian perfection (in which a person is perfect in love) is the goal for humans:
Charismatic Methodists in the United States allied with the Good News caucus and those in Great Britain have been supported by the Lay Witness Movement, which works with Methodist Evangelicals Together. In the United Methodist Church, the charismatic apostolate Aldersgate Renewal Ministries was formed &quot;to pray and work together for the renewal of the church by the power of the Holy Spirit&quot;. It runs events at local United Methodist, Free Methodist and Global Methodist churches, as well as the Methodist School for Supernatural Ministry.

=== Moravianism ===
Some members of the Moravian Church accepted certain elements from the charismatic movement as it spread.

=== Adventism ===

A minority of Seventh-day Adventists today are charismatic. They are strongly associated with those holding more &quot;progressive&quot; Adventist beliefs. In the early decades of the church charismatic or ecstatic phenomena were commonplace.

===Eastern Orthodoxy===

The charismatic movement has not exerted the same influence on the Eastern Orthodox Church that it has on other mainstream Christian denominations. Although some Eastern Orthodox priests have advanced Charismatic practice in their congregations, the movement is seen as incompatible with Orthodoxy by writers within the church. For instance, an article published in the journal &quot;Orthodox Tradition&quot; says,&quot;There is nothing Orthodox about the charismatic movement. It is incompatible with Orthodoxy, in that it justifies itself only by perverting the message of the Fathers, suggesting that the Church of Christ needs renewal, and indulging in the theological imagery of, Pentecostal cultism.&quot;

Some priests forward charismatic renewal in the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese, the Brotherhood of St. Symeon, and other Orthodox churches.

There was a charismatic movement among Evangelical Eastern Orthodox Christians in Russia with Laestadian Lutheran influences (the Ushkovayzet), whose practitioners were known as Hekhulites or Hikhkhulites. Laestadian charismaticism has been attributed to influences from the shamanistic ecstatic religious practices of the Sámi, many of whom are Laestadians today.

===Nondenominational===

The movement led to the creation of independent evangelical charismatic churches more in tune with the revival of the Holy Spirit. These churches are often nondenominational. Calvary Chapel, Costa Mesa, California, was one of the first evangelical charismatic churches, founded in 1965. Victory Outreach International was founded in east Los Angeles in 1967. In the United Kingdom, Jesus Army, founded in 1969, is an example of the influence outside the United States. Many other congregations were established in the rest of the world.

<doc id="474679" wikidata="Q8427587" url="?curid=474679" title="McMug">
<text>McMug () is an anthropomorphic pig cartoon character from Hong Kong featured in comic strips, TV shows, and films. McMug first appeared in 1988, as the central character of a comic strip printed in the Ming Pao weekly magazine. McMug is drawn by cartoonist Alice Mak (麥家碧), with stories written by Brian Tse (謝立文).

Although McMug comics have a somewhat childish style, they often address serious social issues, including death, poverty, and single-parent families, making it resonate with adult audiences as well as children. The plotlines are also known for covering local cultural festivals, and celebrities, reflecting the deep roots of Hong Kong culture.

McMug has become one of the most popular cartoon figures in Hong Kong, appearing in books, movies, TV programs, stationery, bedding and apparently everything else that fits. McMug&#x27;s distant cousin, McDull, is also enjoying huge success.

==Fictional biography==

===Family===
McMug, who grew up on Lantau Island, was adopted when he was only one month old. In a thundery night, all panicky pigs fled from the farm, and among them was McMug who was picked up by a couple who were on the island for a holiday.

McMug can speak. He calls his parents Papa and Mama. The couples were Robin Hood figures when they were young, named BugBug. They count Superman as well as Superwoman amongst their friends.

===Friends===
McMug has his school life in a kindergarten named Springfield Flowers Kindergarten (春田花花幼稚園). He has been studying in kindergarten for 8 years.

* Lisa, a wild boar, is McMug&#x27;s penfriend.
* Darby, a tomcat, is his classmate.
* Goosie, a goose, is known for kindness.
* Fai, a tortoise, is loyal to friends.
* May is a cow.
* June is a female hippopotamus who always hangs out with May. They work out together.
* McDull, McMug&#x27;s only pig friend, who is even sillier than McMug. Early stories suggested that McDull and McMug are distant cousins.
* Miss Chan, a human teacher.
* The Principal, a middle-age man who founded the Springfield Flowers Kindergarten and became its Principal. Incidentally, he also opened a noodle shop in &quot;McDull&#x27;s story&quot;. According to one story, he founded the kindergarten in order to provide a teaching position for his wife, who was migrating to Hong Kong from the Mainland.

==Social impact==
McMug is rare in that it is a comic dedicated to cover social issues and local contemporary culture.

==McMug products==

In 2005, the Circle-K convenience store, together with Bliss (the company that owns the copyright to the McDull and McMug series), launched a marketing campaign named &quot;McMug Spell-it-out&quot; (). For any purchase in Circle-K exceeding HK$20, the customer gets a badge with a picture of McMug (or its friends) and a silly motto sheet. The complete set of these badges features the 26 English letters A–Z, plus additional &quot;secret&quot; designs featuring a heart (with Goosie), an exclamation mark (with Darby), a question mark (with Fai), and an ampersand (with May and June).

<text>Nottingham High School is a private fee-charging day school for boys and girls in Nottingham, England, with an infant and junior school (ages 4–11) and senior school (ages 11–18). There were 1177 students enrolled as at January 2022, of whom 262 were in the sixth form, studying for advanced certificate examinations.

==History==
===Foundation===

In 1513, the &quot;Free School&quot; was founded by Dame Agnes Mellers, after the death of her husband Richard, partly in his memory, but also as atonement for wrongdoings against the people of Nottingham. To do so she enlisted help from Sir Thomas Lovell as governor of Nottingham Castle and Secretary to the Treasury. Through their combined efforts, Henry VIII sealed the school&#x27;s foundation deed on the 22 November that year. It is unclear whether this was a new institution or an endowment of an existing school, of which records exist back to 1289. Almost 20,000 boys are estimated to have attended between 1513 and 2013.

In the foundation deed, Mellers provided for a commemoration service in St Mary&#x27;s Church in the Lace Market &quot;on the Feast of the Translation of St Richard of Chichester, namely 16 June&quot; each year, although the service &quot;is now held on the nearest Saturday to that date.&quot; With the exception of Nottingham Goose Fair, this is the most ancient ceremonial event still held in the city of Nottingham, and the oldest still largely in its original form (the Goose Fair now being a funfair rather than a livestock fair), although there seems to be no record of it being held between the mid-16th century and its revival in 1923. The formal procession seeks to symbolise the ancient links the school has with the Crown, the city and the church. The foundation deed also provides for distributing (out of a total sum of 20 shillings) certain monies to the lord mayor of Nottingham, vicar and others. and for the purchase of bread, cheese and ale for consumption by officials attending the service. Any balance remaining is required to be given to the poorest scholar, but now is given to a representative scholar of the school.
===Coat of arms===
The College of Arms granted the school a coat of arms in 1949, the full blazon being:
The motto, &quot;Lauda finem&quot;, is Latin for &quot;praise [to] the end&quot;.

The arms incorporate those of the founder: the arms of the Mellers family were three blackbirds (or &quot;merles&quot; – an example of canting arms) – on a white field; Dame Agnes, being a woman, would have displayed them on a lozenge, not a shield. In 2007 the school unofficially introduced a new logo for more general use, a modified version of the shield that omits the lozenge and ermine field.

===Remembrance Day service===

An annual Remembrance Day service on 11 November is attended by the whole school with the headmaster, president of the Old Nottinghamians and the school captain placing wreaths at the war memorial. Scholars attend a morning special assembly usually in the Player Hall, at which a minute&#x27;s silence is observed. Representatives of the school&#x27;s Combined Cadet Force mark their respect with a parade around the main school building.

==Premises==
===Location===
Since 1868 the school has stood high on Waverley Mount to the north of the city centre, looking down towards its foundation site in St Mary&#x27;s Church and later building in Stoney Street. The present site has undergone a long programme of building and development.

;Main building

An example of Gothic Revival architecture, the first school building on the present site, built between 1866 and 1867, was designed by Thomas Simpson. It consists of a tower and three wings: West Wing, Middle Corridor, and East Wing. West Wing houses classrooms for mathematics, English and geography. Housed in Middle Corridor are the learning support department, two ICT centres, two language laboratories, religious studies classrooms, two multi-purpose lecture theatres, the school library, and staff offices. East Wing contains the old gymnasium, the Player assembly hall and classrooms for modern languages, history, and classics. The school front and other features are Grade II listed.

;Tower
Overlooking the city centre is the school tower, now used as a staff office. A school standard and the Union Flag are raised on it on special occasions, such as Founder&#x27;s Day and the King&#x27;s Official Birthday, and when a member of the school community has died.

;Additions
To the west, the Founder Hall building was built in 1963 to mark the school&#x27;s 450th anniversary. It includes the school&#x27;s swimming pool and the Founder Hall itself, and acts as a performing venue to supplement the Player Hall. A drama studio was added in 2013 to mark the school&#x27;s 500th anniversary.

The Simon Djanogly Science Building from 1984 is situated to the south west with 13 laboratories for all three sciences. A 25-yard CCF shooting range remains in the basement. The building was opened on 2 March 1984 by the Duke of Edinburgh.

In front of the science building is the music school, completed in 1997. This houses the Lady Carol Djanogly Recital Hall, the Jones Trust Music Room, a music technology studio, a resources centre, seven instrumental teaching rooms, and a larger brass teaching room, a percussion studio and a classroom for Infant and Junior School pupils.
In 1989 a sports hall was built on land to the north-east of the site formerly occupied by fives court and a shooting range. It contains an multi-purpose exercise hall and a fitness room for older pupils.

In the north-west corner is the Sir Harry Djanogly Art, Design and Technology Centre. The ground floor was built in the mid-1990s, and a first floor was added in the 2003/2004 academic year to accommodate modern facilities for the Art Department.

A new dining hall and sixth form centre were constructed in the West Quad in 2009.

;Lovell House Building
Waverley House School, to the west of the main site, was purchased in 2008. Its buildings were refurbished and renamed the Lovell House Infant School. In 2013, this single-sex establishment was combined with the Junior School to form Nottingham High Infant and Junior School.

===Playing field===
The school&#x27;s games field is not on the main site but at Valley Road, approximately to the north. Historically farmland from as early as 1878, namely Harvey&#x27;s Farm; then briefly Hucknall Road Farm in 1920, it was converted to use as a playing field around 1960. It features a number of rugby pitches and posts during winter, which are converted for athletics in the spring, with a running track and areas for shot put, javelin, discus, pole vault, hurdles and high jump. During the summer, the ground is used for cricket, with nets put up and squares re-established for the season. Tennis courts, netball courts, and an archery range are also located there. The pavilion has several changing rooms on the ground and first floors, and a refreshment area for staff and guests. Until 1897, boys played sports and had their PE lessons at the Forest Recreation Ground.

==School organisation==
The junior and senior schools both have four houses, each named after a person connected with the school. The house system plays an integral role in school life. House tutors provide pastoral care and support.

===Junior school houses===
The junior school&#x27;s four houses are named after former pupils or staff who served with distinction in the First World War and were killed in action or died of their wounds. Ball&#x27;s House recalls Albert Ball, a fighter pilot in the RFC and pupil at the school in 1907–1909, Hardy&#x27;s House Theodore Hardy, an assistant master in 1891–1907 and a British Army chaplain in 1916–1918, Tonkin&#x27;s House FC Tonkin, a former pupil who served in the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps, and Trease&#x27;s House Reginald Trease, a pupil at the school in 1898–1905. The houses compete annually for a General Efficiency Cup donated in 1927 by William Crane.

===Senior school houses===
The four houses in the senior school are Mellers&#x27;, named after the school&#x27;s founder, Cooper&#x27;s, named after Frederick Cooper, an artist who in 1872 donated almost of land to the school, Maples&#x27;, named after Samuel Maples, a former pupil who bequeathed £3,000 to fund scholarships in 1892, and White&#x27;s, after Sir Thomas White, who endowed a charity to provide interest-free loans to &quot;young men of good name and thrift&quot; in the Midlands, some money from which was lent to the school in slightly questionable circumstances in the mid-19th century).

;Wheeler Cup
Houses compete for the Wheeler Cup, which is awarded on the cumulative performance in competitions throughout the school year. These cover athletics, chess, hockey, cross country, rugby, bridge, shooting, swimming, cricket, general knowledge, verse recitation, singing, and individual music.

===Curriculum===
Nottingham High School offers a wide range of GCSE, Advanced Subsidiary-Level (AS-level) and General Certificate of Education Advanced-Level (GCE A-level) subjects. Many are also studied by younger pupils at the school in years seven and nine.

Sixth-form subjects include Ancient Greek, art, biology, chemistry, classical civilization, computer science, design and technology, drama, economics, English language, English literature, Extended Project Qualification (EPQ), French, further mathematics, geography, government and politics, German, history, Latin, mathematics, music, music technology, physical education, physics, psychology, religious studies, statistics, and Spanish.

All sixth-form students were expected to undertake the EPQ from 2010, but for students entering sixth form from 2019 it is optional.

===Uniform===
In years 7 to 11, the uniform consists of a black blazer with a badge bearing the arms of Dame Agnes Mellers (displayed on a lozenge), black trousers or a black skirt, a white or grey shirt, black leather shoes, a house tie, and black, grey or navy blue socks. It is also possible to wear a jumper under the blazer. This is black with the school crest on the right chest. For those who have represented the school in sport, it may be black and bear the school coat of arms.

In the sixth form, students wear a black, grey or navy blue suit with a shirt of any colour but black.
Ties are a feature of the school uniform and used to signify pupils&#x27; status within the school.
Special ties include:
*Foundation – A black tie bearing a red squirrel holding a ducal coronet (the crest from the school&#x27;s coat of arms), presented on Founder&#x27;s Day to pupils who have performed well in public examinations (at least ten grade As at GCSE or three As at A-Level), and to teachers on completing ten years&#x27; service
*Lovell Order – Black, bearing the arms of Sir Thomas Lovell, for those who have performed a special service, such as librarians, the choir, orchestra and band secretaries, society officials and the stage staff, and teachers completing twenty years&#x27; service
*Sports Colours – White with narrow diagonal black and yellow stripes, for high sporting achievement, such as first-team level (usually for sports, and occasionally chess, bridge and general knowledge teams)
*Music Colours – Similar to sports colours, first awarded in 2007 to mark outstanding contributions to school music
*Third XV – Black with orange stripes to members of the school rugby third XV
*Prefects – no longer awarded
*Officers – Black with red stripes, bordered by white bands with the school coat-of-arms at top, presented since 2005 to Officers of the School (School Captain, School Vice-Captains and House Captains)
*Quincentenary – Black with diagonal stripes and school coat-of-arms, designed by Young Enterprise Team Sterling, sold to pupils and Old Nottinghamians to mark the 500th anniversary of the School

==Fees==
The school charges admission fees. About a tenth of pupils are supported by bursaries or scholarships giving a reduction of between 10 and 100 per cent, depending on family income.

==Media==
Some of a 1990 episode of the TV series &quot;Boon&quot;, starring Michael Elphick, was filmed at the school, with some pupils as extras. The story was entitled &quot;Bully Boys&quot;, the sixth episode of the fifth series, broadcast on 30 October 1990. The main playground, the Bridge Library (now the library reception), and the Valley Road playing fields were shown.

Kevin Fear (the school&#x27;s current headmaster) and certain boys, were filmed by ITV for a news story shown as part of the news programme &quot;ITV News Central&quot;. Filming took place at several school locations, including the headmaster&#x27;s office, various classrooms and the Lower School Library. The news was that the school had announced it would admit girls – for the first time in its 500-year history – from 2015/2016.

==List of masters==

† Died in office
‡ Never assumed post

Brian Garnet (headmaster 1565 – c. 1575) is notable as the father of the Jesuit priest Henry Garnet, who was executed for his involvement in the Gunpowder Plot.

==Notable alumni==

Between 1902 and 1961 it was known as the Nottingham High School Old Boys&#x27; Society.

<text>In computer science, program derivation is the derivation of a program from its specification, by mathematical means.

To &quot;derive&quot; a program means to write a formal specification, which is usually non-executable, and then apply mathematically correct rules in order to obtain an executable program satisfying that specification. The program thus obtained is then correct by construction. Program and correctness proof are constructed together.

The approach usually taken in formal verification is to first write a program, and then provide a proof that it conforms to a given specification. The main problems with this are that:
* the resulting proof is often long and cumbersome;
* no insight is given as to how the program was developed; it appears &quot;like a rabbit out of a hat&quot;;
* should the program happen to be incorrect in some subtle way, the attempt to verify it is likely to be long and certain to be fruitless.

Program derivation tries to remedy these shortcomings by:
* keeping proofs shorter, by development of appropriate mathematical notations;
* making design decisions through formal manipulation of the specification.

Terms that are roughly synonymous with program derivation are: transformational programming, algorithmics, deductive programming.

The Bird-Meertens Formalism is an approach to program derivation.

Approaches to achieving correctness in Distributed computing include research languages such as the P programming language.

<text>Seomoon Tak (born March 3, 1978), sometimes known mononymously as Tak, is a South Korean singer, noted for her powerful voice and technically skilled wide vocal range. Her debut album &quot;Asura&quot; has been among the top 20 popular karaoke songs in South Korea for more than 20 years. In 2002, she participated in the Red Devils Cheer, the support album for the South Korea national football team at the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

==Biography==
Seomoon Tak is an alumna of Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, and majored in music production and engineering. She debuted in 1999 and sold her first album, &quot;Asura&quot;, over 300,000 copies and her second album, &quot;Seomoon Tak II&quot;, over 300,000 copies. After she debuted in South Korea, she regularly had more than 1,000 live performances per year, and radio and TV shows appearances. She released 6 studio albums (Korean), 2 studio albums (Japanese), and 2 single albums, and recorded multiple movie and television soundtracks. Marty Friedman, the guitarist of Megadeath, also featured her second Japanese album. 

Besides her recordings, she was cast as Yitzhak, the musical Hedwig and the Angry Inch and Acid Queen, and the musical The Who&#x27;s Tommy in both Korea and Japan for many years. She is the first and only Asian Berklee student who was selected to perform for both &quot;Singer&#x27;s Night&quot; and &quot;Singer&#x27;s Showcase&quot; in front of over a thousand audiences at Berklee Performance Center for multiple times.

In 2012, she appeared on the South Korean singing competition television show &quot;I Am a Singer 2&quot;. She survived for five months until the final round of the season.

Upon the release of her second single in summer 2013, she started a project band, Seomoon Tak Band, which held several concerts in South Korea. Seomoon Tak has been performing in small and large venues around the world, including the latest performances in 2022 in New York City and New Orleans.

In 2022, Seomoon Tak co-founded the TAK Company, an entertainment, food and beverage servicing company in the U.S. to promote Korean culture and entertainment.

In 2024, Seomoon Tak sang lead on &quot;The Ballad of the Witches&#x27; Road (Lorna Wu&#x27;s Version)&quot; for Marvel Studios&#x27; series &quot;Agatha All Along&quot;. Lorna Wu was lead singer of the 1970s rock band Lorna Wu and the Coral Shore and mother of blood witch Alice Wu-Gulliver, played by Ali Ahn.

<doc id="474695" wikidata="Q170463" url="?curid=474695" title="Apse">
<text>In architecture, an apse (: apses; from Latin , &#x27;arch, vault&#x27;; from Ancient Greek , , &#x27;arch&#x27;; sometimes written apsis; : apsides) is a semicircular recess covered with a hemispherical vault or semi-dome, also known as an &quot;exedra&quot;. In Byzantine, Romanesque, and Gothic Christian church (including cathedral and abbey) architecture, the term is applied to a semi-circular or polygonal termination of the main building at the liturgical east end (where the altar is), regardless of the shape of the roof, which may be flat, sloping, domed, or hemispherical. Smaller apses are found elsewhere, especially in shrines.

==Definition==
An apse is a semicircular recess, often covered with a hemispherical vault. Commonly, the apse of a church, cathedral or basilica is the semicircular or polygonal termination to the choir or sanctuary, or sometimes at the end of an aisle.

Smaller apses are sometimes built in other parts of the church, especially for reliquaries or shrines of saints.

==History==
The domed apse became a standard part of the church plan in the early Christian era.

==Related features==
In the Eastern Orthodox Church tradition, the south apse is known as the diaconicon and the north apse as the prothesis. Various ecclesiastical features of which the apse may form part are drawn together here.

===Chancel===
The chancel (or sanctuary), directly to the east beyond the choir, contains the high altar, where there is one (compare communion table). This area is reserved for the clergy, and was therefore formerly called the &quot;presbytery&quot;, from Greek &quot;presbuteros&quot;, &quot;elder&quot;, or in older and Catholic usage &quot;priest&quot;.

===Chevet-apse chapels===

Semi-circular choirs, first developed in the East, which came into use in France in 470. By the onset of the 13th century, they had been augmented with radiating apse chapels outside the choir aisle, the entire structure of apse, choir and radiating chapels coming to be known as the &quot;chevet&quot; (French, &quot;headpiece&quot;).

<text>In cryptography, Skipjack is a block cipher—an algorithm for encryption—developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). Initially classified, it was originally intended for use in the controversial Clipper chip. Subsequently, the algorithm was declassified.

==History of Skipjack==
Skipjack was proposed as the encryption algorithm in a US government-sponsored scheme of key escrow, and the cipher was provided for use in the Clipper chip, implemented in tamperproof hardware. Skipjack is used only for encryption; the key escrow is achieved through the use of a separate mechanism known as the Law Enforcement Access Field (LEAF).

The algorithm was initially secret, and was regarded with considerable suspicion by many for that reason. It was declassified on 24 June 1998, shortly after its basic design principle had been discovered independently by the public cryptography community.

To ensure public confidence in the algorithm, several academic researchers from outside the government were called in to evaluate the algorithm. The researchers found no problems with either the algorithm itself or the evaluation process. Moreover, their report gave some insight into the (classified) history and development of Skipjack:

In March 2016, NIST published a draft of its cryptographic standard which no longer certifies Skipjack for US government applications.

==Description==
Skipjack uses an 80-bit key to encrypt or decrypt 64-bit data blocks. It is an unbalanced Feistel network with 32 rounds. It was designed to be used in secured phones.

==Cryptanalysis==
Eli Biham and Adi Shamir discovered an attack against 16 of the 32 rounds within one day of declassification, and (with Alex Biryukov) extended this to 31 of the 32 rounds (but with an attack only slightly faster than exhaustive search) within months using impossible differential cryptanalysis.

A truncated differential attack was also published against 28 rounds of Skipjack cipher.

A claimed attack against the full cipher was published in 2002, but a later paper with attack designer as a co-author clarified in 2009 that no attack on the full 32 round cipher was then known.

==In pop culture==
An algorithm named Skipjack forms part of the back-story to Dan Brown&#x27;s 1998 novel &quot;Digital Fortress&quot;. In Brown&#x27;s novel, Skipjack is proposed as the new public-key encryption standard, along with a back door secretly inserted by the NSA (&quot;a few lines of cunning programming&quot;) which would have allowed them to decrypt Skipjack using a secret password and thereby &quot;read the world&#x27;s email&quot;. When details of the cipher are publicly released, programmer Greg Hale discovers and announces details of the backdoor. In real life there is evidence to suggest that the NSA has added back doors to at least one algorithm; the Dual_EC_DRBG random number algorithm may contain a backdoor accessible only to the NSA.

Additionally, in the &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; modification &quot;Dystopia&quot;, the &quot;encryption&quot; program used in cyberspace apparently uses both Skipjack and Blowfish algorithms.

<text>RAF Bomber Command controlled the Royal Air Force&#x27;s bomber forces from 1936 to 1968. Along with the United States Army Air Forces, it played the central role in the strategic bombing of Germany in World War II. From 1942 onward, the British bombing campaign against Germany became less restrictive and increasingly targeted industrial sites and the civilian manpower base essential for German war production. In total 501,536 operational sorties were flown, of bombs were dropped and 8,325 aircraft lost in action. Bomber Command crews also suffered a high casualty rate: 55,573 were killed out of a total of 125,000 aircrew, a 44.4% death rate. A further 8,403 men were wounded in action, and 9,838 became prisoners of war.

Bomber Command stood at the peak of its post-war military power in the 1960s, the V bombers holding the United Kingdom&#x27;s nuclear deterrent and a supplemental force of Canberra light bombers. In 1968 it was merged with Fighter Command to form Strike Command.

A memorial in Green Park in London was unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 June 2012 to commemorate the high casualty rate among the aircrews. In April 2018 The International Bomber Command Centre was opened in Lincoln.

==Background==
At the time of the formation of Bomber Command in 1936, Giulio Douhet&#x27;s slogan &quot;the bomber will always get through&quot; was popular, and figures like Stanley Baldwin cited it. Until advances in radar technology in the late 1930s, this statement was effectively true. Attacking bombers could not be detected early enough to assemble fighters fast enough to prevent them reaching their targets. Some damage might be done to the bombers by anti-aircraft (AA) guns, and by fighters as the bombers returned to base, but that was not as effective as a proper defence. Consequently, the early conception of Bomber Command was as an entity that threatened the enemy with utter destruction. The Italian general Giulio Douhet, author of &quot;The Command of the Air&quot;, was of that view.

In 1936, Germany&#x27;s increasing air power was feared by British government planners who commonly overestimated its size, reach and hitting power. Planners used estimates of up to 72 British deaths per tonne () of bombs dropped, though this figure was grossly exaggerated. As well, the planners did not know that German bombing aircraft of the day (not quite 300 Junkers Ju 52 medium bombers) did not have the range to reach the UK with a load of bombs and return to the mainland. British air officers did nothing to correct these perceptions because they could see the usefulness of having a strong bombing arm.

==Early years of the Second World War==

At the start of the Second World War in 1939, Bomber Command faced four problems. The first was lack of size; Bomber Command was not large enough effectively to operate as an independent strategic force. The second was rules of engagement; at the start of the war, the targets allocated to Bomber Command were not wide enough in scope. The third problem was the Command&#x27;s lack of technology; specifically radio or radar derived navigational aids to allow accurate target location at night or through cloud. (In 1938, E. G. &quot;Taffy&quot; Bowen proposed using ASV radar for navigation, only to have Bomber Command disclaim need for it, saying the sextant was sufficient.) The fourth problem was the limited accuracy of bombing, especially from high level.

When the war began on 1 September 1939, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the neutral United States, issued an appeal to the major belligerents to confine their air raids to military targets. The French and British agreed to abide by the request, provided &quot;that these same rules of warfare will be scrupulously observed by all of their opponents&quot;. British policy was to restrict bombing to military targets and infrastructure, such as ports and railways which were of military importance. While acknowledging that bombing Germany would cause civilian casualties, the British government renounced deliberate bombing of civilian property (outside combat zones) as a military tactic.

The British government did not want to violate its agreement by attacking civilian targets outside combat zones and the French were even more concerned lest Bomber Command operations provoke a German bombing attack on France. Since the had few modern fighters and no defence network comparable to the British Chain Home radar stations, this left France powerless before the threat of a German bombing attack. The final problem was lack of adequate aircraft. The Bomber Command workhorses at the start of the war, the Vickers Wellington, Armstrong Whitworth Whitley and Handley Page Hampden/Hereford, had been designed as tactical-support medium bombers and none of them had enough range or ordnance capacity for anything more than a limited strategic offensive. Of these the Wellington had the longest range at .

Bomber Command became even smaller after the declaration of war. No. 1 Group, with its squadrons of Fairey Battles, left for France to form the Advanced Air Striking Force. This action had two aims: to give the British Expeditionary Force some air-striking power and to allow the Battles to operate against German targets, since they lacked the range to do so from British airfields.

In May 1940, some of the Advanced Air Striking Force was caught on the ground by German air attacks on their airfields at the opening of the invasion of France. The remainder of the Battles proved to be horrendously vulnerable to enemy fire. Many times, Battles would set out to attack and be almost wiped out in the process. e.g. 10 May 1940 when a significant number of Battles were shot down or damaged.

Following the Rotterdam Blitz of 14 May, RAF Bomber Command was authorized to attack German targets east of the Rhine on 15 May; the Air Ministry authorized Air Marshal Charles Portal to attack targets in the Ruhr, including oil plants and other civilian industrial targets which aided the German war effort, such as blast furnaces (which were visible at night). The first attack took place on the night of 15/16 May, with 96 bombers setting off to attack targets east of the Rhine, 78 of which were against oil targets. Of these, only 24 claimed to have found their targets.

Bomber Command itself soon fully joined in the action; in the Battle of Britain, Bomber Command was assigned to bomb invasion barges and fleets assembling in the Channel ports. This was much less public than the battles of the Spitfires and Hurricanes of RAF Fighter Command but still vital and dangerous work, carried out night after night.

Bomber Command was also indirectly responsible, in part at least, for the switch of attention away from Fighter Command to bombing civilian targets. A German bomber on a raid got lost due to poor navigation and bombed London. Prime Minister Winston Churchill consequently ordered a retaliatory raid on the German capital of Berlin. The damage caused was minor but the raid sent Hitler into a rage. He ordered the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; to level British cities, thus precipitating the Blitz.

Like the United States Army Air Forces later in the war, Bomber Command had first concentrated on a doctrine of &quot;precision&quot; bombing in daylight. When the German defences inflicted costly defeats on British raids in late 1939, a switch to night bombing was forced upon the Command. The problems of enemy defences were then replaced with the problems of night navigation and target-finding. In the early years of the war bombers had to rely on dead reckoning navigation supported by radio fixes and astro-navigation.

==Organisation==
Bomber Command comprised a number of Groups. It began the war with Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 Groups. No. 1 Group was soon sent to France and then returned to Bomber Command control after the evacuation of France. No. 2 Group consisted of light and medium bombers who, although operating both by day and night, remained part of Bomber Command until 1943, when it was removed to the control of Second Tactical Air Force, to form the light bomber component of that command. Bomber Command also gained two new groups during the war: the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) squadrons were organised into No. 6 Group and the Pathfinder Force was expanded to form No. 8 (Pathfinder) Group from existing squadrons on 8 January 1943. 

Many squadrons and personnel from Commonwealth and other European countries flew in Bomber Command. No. 6 Group, which was activated on 1 January 1943, was unique among Bomber Command groups, in that it was not an RAF unit; it was a Canadian unit attached to Bomber Command. At its peak strength, 6 Group consisted of 14 operational RCAF bomber squadrons and 15 squadrons served with the group. No. 8 Group, also known as the Pathfinder Force, was activated on 15 August 1942. It was a critical part of solving the navigational and aiming problems experienced. Bomber Command solved its navigational problems using two methods. One was the use of a range of increasingly sophisticated electronic aids to navigation and the other was the use of specialist Pathfinders. The technical aids to navigation took two forms. One was external radio navigation aids, as exemplified by Gee and the later highly accurate Oboe systems. The other was the centimetric navigation equipment H2S radar carried in the bombers. The Pathfinders were a group of elite, specially trained and experienced crews who flew ahead of the main bombing forces and marked the targets with flares and special marker-bombs. No. 8 Group controlled the Pathfinder squadrons. 

A number of other groups were part of the command, including, in June 1944, No. 26 Group RAF, three operational training groups – No. 91 Group RAF at Morton Hall, Swinderby, which was merged into No. 21 Group RAF, part of RAF Flying Training Command, on 1 May 1947; Nos 92 and 93 Groups; and No. 100 Group RAF (of which last was responsible for development, operational trial and use of electronic warfare and countermeasures equipment).

==Strategic bombing 1942–1945==

In 1941, the Butt Report revealed the extent of bombing inaccuracy: Churchill noted that &quot;this is a very serious paper and seems to require urgent attention&quot;. The Area Bombing Directive of 14 February 1942 ordered Bomber Command to target German industrial areas and the &quot;morale of...the industrial workers&quot;. The directive also reversed the order of the previous year instructing Bomber Command to conserve its forces; this resulted in a large campaign of area bombardment against the Ruhr area. Professor Frederick Lindemann&#x27;s &quot;de-housing&quot; paper of March identified the expected effectiveness of attacks on residential and general industrial areas of cities. The aerial bombing of cities such as the Operation Millennium raid on Cologne continued throughout the rest of the war, culminating in the controversial bombing of Dresden in 1945.
In 1942, the main workhorse-aircraft of the later part of the war came into service: the four-engined heavies. The Halifax and Lancaster made up the backbone of the Command; they had a longer range, higher speed and much greater bomb load than earlier aircraft. The older four-engined Short Stirling and twin-engined Vickers Wellington bombers were not taken out of service, but moved to less demanding tasks such as mine-laying. The classic aircraft of the Pathfinders, the de Havilland Mosquito, also made its appearance. By 25 July 1943, the Bomber Command headquarters had come to occupy &quot;a substantial set of red brick buildings, hidden in the middle of a forest on top of a hill in the English county of Buckinghamshire&quot;.

An offensive against the Rhine-Ruhr area (&quot;Happy Valley&quot; to aircrew) began on the night of 5/6 March 1943, with the first raid of the Battle of the Ruhr on Essen. The bombers destroyed of the city and hit 53 Krupps buildings. The Battle of Hamburg in mid-1943 was one of the most successful Bomber Command operations, although Harris&#x27; extension of the offensive into the Battle of Berlin failed to destroy the capital and cost his force more than 1,000 crews in the winter of 1943–44. In August 1943, Operation Hydra, the bombing of the Peenemünde V-2 rocket facility opened the secondary Operation Crossbow campaign against long-range weapons.

By April 1944, Harris was forced to reduce his strategic offensive as the bomber force was directed (much to his annoyance) to tactical and transport targets in France in support of the invasion of Normandy. The transport offensive proved highly effective. By late 1944, bombing such as Operation Hurricane (to demonstrate the capabilities of the combined British and US bomber forces), competed against the German defences. Bomber Command was now capable of putting 1,000 aircraft over a target without extraordinary efforts. Within 24 hours of Operation Hurricane, the RAF dropped about of bombs on Duisburg and Brunswick, the greatest bomb load dropped in a day during the Second World War.

Wesel in the Rhineland, bombed on 16, 17, 18 and 19 February, was bombed again on 23 March, leaving the city &quot;97 percent destroyed&quot;. The last raid on Berlin took place on the night of 21/22 April, when 76 Mosquitos made six attacks just before Soviet forces entered the city centre. By this point, most RAF bombing operations were for the purpose of providing tactical support. The last major strategic raid was the destruction of the oil refinery at Vallø (Tønsberg) in southern Norway by 107 Lancasters, on the night of 25/26 April 1945.

Once the surrender of Germany had occurred, plans were made to send a &quot;Very Long Range Bomber Force&quot; known as Tiger Force to participate in the Pacific war against Japan. Made up of about 30 British Commonwealth heavy bomber squadrons, a reduction of the original plan of about 1,000 aircraft, the British bombing component was intended to be based on Okinawa. Bomber Command groups were re-organised for Operation Downfall but the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki occurred before the force had been transferred to the Pacific.

In Europe Bomber Command&#x27;s final operation was to fly released Allied prisoners of war home to Britain in Operation Exodus.

==Casualties==

Bomber Command crews suffered an extremely high casualty rate: 55,573 killed out of a total of 125,000 aircrew (a 44.4 per cent death rate), a further 8,403 were wounded in action and 9,838 became prisoners of war. This covered all Bomber Command operations.

A Bomber Command crew member had a worse chance of survival than an infantry officer in World War I; more people were killed serving in Bomber Command than in the Blitz, or the bombings of Hamburg or Dresden. By comparison, the US Eighth Air Force, which flew daylight raids over Europe, had 350,000 aircrew during the war and suffered 26,000 killed and 23,000 POWs. Of the RAF Bomber Command personnel killed during the war, 72 per cent were British, 18 per cent were Canadian, 7 per cent were Australian and 3 per cent were New Zealanders.

Taking an example of 100 airmen:
* 55 killed on operations or died as a result of wounds
* three injured (in varying levels of severity) on operations or active service
* 12 taken prisoner of war (some wounded)
* two shot down and evaded capture
* 27 survived a tour of operations

In total 501,536 operational sorties were flown, of bombs were dropped and 8,325 aircraft lost in action.

Harris was advised by an Operational Research Section (ORS-BC) under a civilian, Basil Dickins, supported by a small team of mathematicians and scientists. ORS-BC (under Reuben Smeed) was concerned with analysing bomber losses. They were able to influence operations by identifying successful defensive tactics and equipment, though some of their more controversial advice (such as removing ineffectual turrets from bombers to increase speed) was ignored.

The very high casualties suffered give testimony to the dedication and courage of Bomber Command aircrew in carrying out their orders. The overall loss rate for Bomber Command operations was 2.2 per cent, but loss rates over Germany were significantly higher; from November 1943 – March 1944, losses averaged 5.1 per cent. The highest loss rate (11.8 per cent) was incurred on the Nuremberg raid (30 March 1944). The disparity in loss rates was reflected in that, at times, Bomber Command considered making sorties over France only count as a third of an op towards the &quot;tour&quot; total and crews derisively referred to officers who only chose to fly on the less dangerous ops to France as &quot;François&quot;. The loss rates excluded aircraft crashing in the UK on return, even if the machine was a write-off and there were crew casualties, which amounted to at least another 15 percent. Losses in training were significant and some courses lost 25 per cent of their intake before graduation; 5,327 men were killed in training from 1939 to 1945.

RAF Bomber Command had 19 Victoria Cross recipients.

==Effectiveness of operations==

Albert Speer, Hitler&#x27;s Minister of Armaments, noted that the larger British bombs were highly destructive. 15 years after the war&#x27;s end, Speer was unequivocal about the effect,
In terms of production decrease resulting from the RAF area attacks, the US survey, based upon limited research, found that in 1943 it amounted to 9 per cent and in 1944 to 17 per cent. Relying on US gathered statistics, the British survey found that actual arms production decreases were a mere 3 per cent for 1943, and 1 per cent for 1944. However they did find decreases of 46.5 per cent and 39 per cent in the second half of 1943 and 1944 respectively in the metal processing industries. These losses resulted from the devastating series of raids the Command launched on the Ruhr Valley. A contrasting view was offered by Adam Tooze that by referring to contemporary sources rather than post-war accounts:
and that in the first quarter of 1943 steel production fell by , leading to cuts in the German ammunition production programme and a sub-components crisis (). German aircraft output did not increase between July 1943 and March 1944:
The greatest contribution to winning the war made by Bomber Command was in the huge diversion of German resources into defending the homeland. By January 1943 some 1,000 Luftwaffe night fighters were committed to the defence of the Reich; mostly twin engined Messerschmitt Bf 110 and Junkers Ju 88. Most critically, by September 1943, 8,876 of the deadly, dual purpose 88 mm guns were also defending the homeland with a further 25,000 light flak guns, 20/37 mm. Though the 88 mm gun was an effective AA weapon, it was also a deadly destroyer of tanks, and lethal against advancing infantry. These weapons would have done much to augment German anti-tank defences on the Russian front.

Mine laying operations were a major contribution to the disruption of German naval activities. Aerial minelaying was used on the iron ore routes from Scandinavia and U-boat training areas in the Baltic; in North-West Europe aerial mines sank seven times more ships than naval mines laid from ships.

In operations Bomber Command laid 47,278 mines while losing 468 aircraft; Coastal Command contribution was 936 mines.
Bomber Command and Coastal Command minelaying is credited with the loss of 759 vessels totalling .

German production was diverted into construction and manning of minesweepers and the deployment of flak batteries to protect ports and estuaries. Around 100 vessels, mostly cargo types and around , were converted to mine barrage breakers to sail ahead of ships leaving harbour and of these about half of were lost to mines.

==1946–1968==
Bomber Command acquired B-29 Superfortresses, known to the RAF as Boeing Washingtons, to supplement the Avro Lincoln, a development of the Lancaster. The first jet bomber, the English Electric Canberra light bomber, became operational in 1951. Some Canberras remained in RAF service up to 2006 as photo-reconnaissance aircraft. The model proved an extremely successful aircraft; Britain exported it to many countries and licensed it for construction in Australia and the United States. The joint US-UK Project E was intended to make nuclear weapons available to Bomber Command in an emergency, with the Canberras the first aircraft to benefit. The next jet bomber to enter service was the Vickers Valiant in 1955, the first of the V bombers.
The Air Ministry conceived of the V bombers as the replacement for the wartime Lancasters and Halifaxes. Three advanced aircraft were developed from 1946, along with the Short Sperrin fall-back design. Multiple designs were tried out because no one could predict which designs would be successful at the time. The V bombers became the backbone of the British nuclear forces and comprised the Valiant, Handley Page Victor (in service in 1958) and Avro Vulcan (1956).

In 1956 Bomber Command faced its first operational test since the Second World War. The Egyptian Government nationalised the Suez Canal in July 1956, and British troops took part in an invasion along with French and Israeli forces. During the Suez Crisis, Britain deployed Bomber Command Canberras to Cyprus and Malta and Valiants to Malta. The Canberra performed well but the Valiant had problems, since it had only just been introduced into service. The Canberras proved vulnerable to attack by the Egyptian Air Force, which fortunately did not choose to attack the crowded airfields of Cyprus (RAF Akrotiri and RAF Nicosia holding nearly the whole RAF strike force, with a recently reactivated and poor-quality airfield taking much of the French force). Bomber Command aircraft took part in operations against Egypt.

Between 1959 and 1963, in addition to manned aircraft, Bomber Command also gained 60 Thor nuclear intermediate-range ballistic missiles dispersed to 20 RAF stations around Britain in a joint UK-US operation known as Project Emily. During the following twelve years, Bomber Command aircraft frequently deployed overseas to the Far East and Middle East. They served particularly as a deterrent to Sukarno&#x27;s Indonesia during the Konfrontasi. A detachment of Canberras had a permanent base at Akrotiri in Cyprus in support of CENTO obligations.

Britain tested its first atomic bomb in 1952 and exploded its first hydrogen bomb in 1957. Operation Grapple saw Valiant bombers testing the dropping of hydrogen bombs over Christmas Island. Advances in electronic countermeasures were also applied to the V bombers over the same period and the remaining V bombers came into service in the late 1950s. During the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962, Bomber Command aircraft maintained continuous strip alerts, ready to take off at a moment&#x27;s notice, and the Thor missiles were maintained at advanced readiness.

By the early 1960s doubts emerged about the ability of Bomber Command to pierce the defences of the Soviet Union. The shooting down of a U-2 spyplane in 1960 confirmed that the Soviet Union did have surface-to-air missiles capable of reaching the heights at which bombers operated. Since the Second World War the philosophy of bombing had involved going higher and faster. With the supersession of high and fast tactics, ultra-low-level attack was substituted. Bomber Command aircraft had not been designed for that kind of attack, and airframe fatigue increased. All Valiants were grounded in October 1964 and permanently withdrawn from service in January 1965.

Bomber Command&#x27;s other main function was to provide tanker aircraft to the RAF. The Valiant was the first bomber used as a tanker operationally. As high-level penetration declined as an attack technique, the Valiant saw more and more use as a tanker until the retirement of the type in 1965 due to the costs of remediating metal fatigue. With the Victor also unsuited to the low-level role six were converted to tankers to replace the Valiants, before the later conversion of the majority of Victors to tankers. The Vulcan also saw service as a tanker, and was used to bomb the main runway at Port Stanley Airport during the Falklands War.

In a further attempt to make the operation of the bomber force safer, attempts were made to develop stand-off weapons, with which capability the bombers would not have to penetrate Soviet airspace. However, efforts to do so had only limited success. The first attempt involved the Blue Steel missile (in service: 1963–1970). It worked, but its range meant that bombers still had to enter Soviet airspace. Longer-range systems were developed, but failed and/or were cancelled. This fate befell the Mark 2 of the Blue Steel, its replacement, the American Skybolt ALBM and the ground-based Blue Streak programme, which was cancelled in 1960.

RAF Fighter Command and Bomber Command merged in 1968 to form Strike Command. RAF Coastal Command followed in November 1969.

==Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief==
At any one time several air officers served on the staff of Bomber Command and so the overall commander was known as the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, the most well-known being Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris. The Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief are listed below with the rank which they held whilst in post.







==Battle honours==
* &quot;Berlin 1940–1945&quot;: For bombardment of Berlin by aircraft of Bomber Command.
* &quot;Fortress Europe 1940–1944&quot;: For operations by aircraft based in the British Isles against targets in Germany, Italy and enemy-occupied Europe, from the fall of France to the invasion of Normandy.

==Memorials==
Singer Robin Gibb led an effort to commemorate those who died during World War II and in April, 2011, it was announced that the £5.6 million needed to build the memorial had been raised. The foundation stone of the Bomber Command Memorial for the crews of Bomber Command was laid in Green Park, London on 4 May 2011.

The memorial was designed by architect Liam O&#x27;Connor, who was also responsible for the design and construction of the Commonwealth Memorial Gates on Constitution Hill, near Buckingham Palace. Sculptor Philip Jackson created the large bronze sculpture which stands within the memorial. It consists of seven figures tall, and represents the aircrew of a Bomber Command heavy bomber. Jackson described the sculpture as capturing &quot;the moment when they get off the aircraft and they&#x27;ve dumped all their heavy kit onto the ground&quot;.
The memorial was dedicated and unveiled on 28 June 2012 by Queen Elizabeth II.
In August 2006, a memorial was unveiled at Lincoln Cathedral.

The International Bomber Command Centre (IBCC) is a memorial and interpretation centre telling the story of Bomber Command. The centre was opened to the public at the end of January 2018, and the official opening ceremony was held on 12 April 2018, as part of the 100th anniversary celebrations of the RAF. The memorial itself consists of a Memorial Spire and an array of walls listing the names of the 57,861 personnel who died in Bomber Command in the Second World War.

==Medal clasp and proposed medal ==
The planned campaign medal for Bomber Command was never struck. The decision not to award a medal for all members of Bomber Command occurred during the short gap between the wartime coalition and Attlee&#x27;s Labour Government, whilst Churchill was still P.M. This caused Harris to turn down Attlee&#x27;s subsequent offer of a peerage in protest at this snub; a principled stand which Harris had taken, and declared, at the time the decision not to award a separate campaign medal was made. The Command&#x27;s raids had tied up huge amounts of Germany&#x27;s defensive resources - which might have been diverted to the Eastern and Western Fronts and elsewhere - and the physical destruction of war material was considerable. Nevertheless, Churchill, much to Harris&#x27;s chagrin, made virtually no mention of Bomber Command&#x27;s campaign in his victory speech on V.E.day. Harris, who was promoted to Marshal of the RAF by the Labour Government in 1946, was persuaded to accept a baronetcy when Winston Churchill became prime minister again in 1951, after Attlee&#x27;s Labour Government was voted out of office. As of 2018, the battle for a campaign medal continues.
The Military Medals Review was undertaken by Sir John Holmes and published in July 2012. In December 2012, following the review, the British government announced the introduction of a &quot;Bomber Command&quot; clasp to be worn on the 1939–1945 Star. The second such clasp after the &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; which had been instituted in 1945. A clasp rather than a separate medal was preferred because recipients would have already received either the Air Crew Europe Star or the France and Germany Star, and a specific medal would have resulted in “double-medalling”. It is a long-standing principle of the British honours system that &quot;same individual should not be able to receive two campaign medals for the same element of military service&quot;; i.e. double-medalling. The eligibility for the &quot;Bomber Command&quot; clasp is as follows: having already qualified for the 1939–1945 Star, the individual must have served for at least sixty days or one complete tour of operations on a Bomber Command unit and flew at least one operational sortie on a Bomber Command operational unit from the 3 September 1939 to the 8 May 1945 inclusive.

<text>Lough Erne ( , ) is the name of two connected lakes in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. It is the second-biggest lake system in Northern Ireland and Ulster, and the fourth biggest in Ireland. The lakes are widened sections of the River Erne, which flows north and then curves west into the Atlantic. The smaller southern lake is called the Upper Lough as it is higher up the river. The bigger northern lake is called the Lower Lough or Broad Lough. The town of Enniskillen lies on the short stretch of river between the lakes. The lake has more than 150 islands, along with many coves and inlets. The River Erne is 80 miles (129 km) long and drains an area of about 1,680 square miles (4,350 km2).

== Name, mythology and folklore ==
Lough Erne (Loch Éirne) appears to be named after an ancient population group called the Érainn, or after a goddess from which the Érainn took their name. Since tribes were often named after a divine ancestor, T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly suggested that the Érainn took their name from a goddess named Érann and that Loch Éirne probably means &quot;lake of (the goddess) Érann&quot;. O&#x27;Rahilly and other scholars have connected these names to Ériu (modern Éire), the goddess after which Ireland is named. He writes that the earlier forms of these goddess names were Everna/Iverna and Everiu/Iveriu and that both come from &quot;the Indo-European root &quot;ei-&quot;, implying motion&quot;. In his view Érann and Ériu would thus appear to mean &quot;she who travels regularly&quot;, explained as &quot;the sun-goddess, for the sun was the great celestial Traveller&quot;. Alternatively, John T. Koch suggests that Ériu was a mother goddess whose name comes from an Indo-European word stem meaning &quot;fat, rich, fertile&quot;.

In Irish mythology and folklore, there are three tales about the lake&#x27;s origins. One says that it is named after a mythical woman named Erne, Queen Méabh&#x27;s lady-in-waiting at Cruachan. Erne and her maidens were frightened away from Cruachan when a fearsome giant emerged from the cave of Oweynagat. They fled northward and drowned in a river or lake, their bodies dissolving to become Lough Erne. Patricia Monaghan notes that &quot;The drowning of a goddess in a river is common in Irish mythology and typically represents the dissolving of her divine power into the water, which then gives life to the land&quot;. Another tale says that it was formed when a magical spring-well overflowed, similar to the tale of Lough Neagh. The third says that, during a battle between the Érainn and the army of High King Fíachu Labrainne, it burst from the ground and drowned the Érainn. In &quot;Cath Maige Tuired&quot; (&quot;the Battle of Moytura&quot;), it is listed as one of the twelve chief loughs of Ireland. Historically, the lake was also called &quot;Loch Saimer&quot; (&quot;Samhaoir&quot;). In folklore Partholón killed his wife&#x27;s favourite hound, Saimer, in a fit of jealous rage, and the lake was named after it.

Lough Erne is the setting of a folk tale known as &quot;The Story of Conn-eda&quot; or &quot;The Golden Apples of Lough Erne&quot;, which appears in &quot;Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry&quot; (1888). In the tale, Conn-eda goes on a quest to procure three golden apples, a black steed and a supernatural hound from a city underneath Lough Erne. The city is ruled by a king of the Fir Bolg.

== History ==
The Menapii are the only known Celtic tribe specifically named on Ptolemy’s AD 150 map of Ireland, where they located their first colony, Menapia, on the Leinster coast circa 216 BC. They later settled around Lough Erne, becoming known as the Fir Manach, and giving their name to Fermanagh and Monaghan. Mongán mac Fiachnai, a 7th-century King of Ulster, is the protagonist of several legends linking him with Manannán mac Lir. They spread across Ireland, evolving into historic Irish (also Scottish and Manx) clans.

The Annals of Ulster were written in the late 15th century on Belle Isle, an island in Upper Lough Erne.

During the Second World War, RAF Castle Archdale was based on Lough Erne, providing an essential airbase for the Battle of the Atlantic and the battle against U-boats. A secret agreement with the Irish Government permitted flying boats based there to fly West straight across neutral Ireland to the Atlantic, avoiding the two-hour detour that would have been necessary for aeroplanes based in Northern Ireland. This flight path became known as &#x27;The Donegal Corridor&#x27;. An example of the many ways Ireland assisted the allies while remaining neutral.

In November 2012, it was announced that the Lough Erne Resort, a hotel on the southern shore of the Lower Lough, would host the 39th G8 summit.

== Geography ==
=== Islands ===
The lakes contain many small islands and peninsulas, which are also called &quot;islands&quot; because of the highly convoluted shoreline and because many of them were islands prior to two extensive drainage schemes in the 1880s and the 1950s which dropped the water level by about 5 feet (1.5 metres). The &quot;Parliamentary Gazetteer&quot; of 1846 stated, &quot;The islands are popularly fabled to be as numerous as the days of the year; but they have been more soberly estimated at 90 in the Upper Lake and 109 in the Lower&quot;.

The largest islands are Inishmore at the northern end of Upper Lough Erne (not to be confused with &quot;Inish More or Davy&#x27;s Island&quot; in Lower Lough Erne) and Galloon Island at the lower end of Upper Lough Erne. Whether these are entirely bounded by the lake, or partly bounded by the River Erne, is a matter of opinion. The next largest is Boa Island, within Lower Lough Erne. All three of these comprise multiple townlands. Many of the next largest islands constitute a single townland.

Islands in the lower lake include Boa Island, Cleenishmeen Island, Crevinishaughy Island, Cruninish Island, Devenish Island, Ely Island, Goat Island, Horse Island, Inish Doney, Inish Fovar, Inish Lougher, Inish More or Davy&#x27;s Island, Inis Rath, Inishmacsaint, Inishmakill, Lustybeg Island, Lustymore Island and White Island.

Those in the upper lake include Bleanish Island, Crehan Island, Dernish Island, Inishcorkish, Inishcrevan, Inishfendra, Inishleague, Inishlught, Inishrath, Inishturk, Killygowan Island, Naan Island and Trannish. Several of the islands are privately owned, and occasionally come on to the open market. In 2007 Inishturk went on the market at the price of £695,000. In 2012 Inisliroo went on the market at the price of £600,000.

The lake islands are the main Irish stronghold of the scarce garden warbler.

== Administration ==
Waterways Ireland, a cross-border organisation, established under the Good Friday Agreement in 1999, is responsible for navigation on the Erne System, as well the island of Ireland&#x27;s other navigable waterways.

Department for Infrastructure Rivers retains ownership of the bed and foreshore and manages water levels within the ranges specified in the Erne Drainage and Development Act (1950). The drainage scheme was designed by Percy Shepherd. Water level control is undertaken in conjunction with the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) in the Republic of Ireland under the terms of an agreement made in 1950 when the River Erne was harnessed for hydroelectric power generation. The agreement requires that levels are maintained in the Upper Lough between 150 ft. and 154 ft. (Apr. – Sept.) / 155 ft. (Oct. – Mar.), and in the Lower Lough between 147 ft. and 152 ft. These levels relate to the Irish grid datum at Poolbeg Lighthouse.

Water levels in Upper and Lower Lough Erne are managed by a control structures located at Portora in Enniskillen and by the hydro electric power station at Cliff between Belleek and Ballyshannon, in the Republic of Ireland. During the summer period it is aimed to keep the water level at the down steam side of Portora, at or above, 150 ft. to avoid the need for the gates to be closed requiring the use of the navigation lock. This is to prevent restriction to boat traffic using the navigation facilities at the peak tourist period.
Rapid draw down of water levels in the Upper Lough is prevented by the restricted capacity of the inter-lough channel section. This means that Rivers Agency must anticipate significant inflows by drawing down the loughs to ensure flood storage is available. In November 2009 the Erne system experienced a very significant flood event. The water levels were the highest recorded since the changes to the system in the 1950s.

The Erne Rivers Trust is a Rivers Trust NGO trying to help maintain the clean water in the Lough Erne catchment for all the flora and fauna.

== Sport and tourism ==
The Lough Erne area is popular for angling and watersports, with waterskiing, rowing and wakeboarding being amongst the most popular; the stretch of water alongside the Broadmeadow, Enniskillen, has hosted stages of the World Waterski Championships annually since 2005, and in 2007, a pro-wakeboard competition, &#x27;Wakejam&#x27; was hosted by the Erne Wakeboard Club (EWC) after successful national wakeboard competitions in the previous years. Canoeing is also a popular recreational sport on the Erne.

Lough Erne Yacht Club is based in Gublusk Bay. The Lough Erne Regatta is Ireland’s oldest event for racing under sail, with a lineage beyond 1820. The RNLI has an inland lifeboat and rescue watercraft based at Gublusk with a further station at Carrybridge on the Upper lake.

Several historical sites on Lough Erne&#x27;s islands attract tourists: Among them the monastic ruins on Devenish Island or the stone figures on Boa Island and White Island

The Lough Erne Golf &amp; Hotel Resort was opened in October 2007 by Irish businessman Jim Treacy. It is situated on a 600-acre peninsula between Castle Hume Lough and Lower Lough Erne. On 12 May 2011 it was announced that the owner of the hotel, Castle Hume Leisure Limited, had gone into administration. The Lough Erne Resort hosted the Lough Erne Challenge in 2009 and 2010. It was also due to host the 2017 Irish Open golf tournament but the event was moved to a different venue.

== Transport ==
A canal, the Shannon–Erne Waterway, runs between the upper end of the River Shannon and the River Erne, allowing boat movements from the Shannon estuary in southwest Ireland, through the western midlands of the country, across to the northwest and out to the Atlantic again (although the final section to the Atlantic side of Belleek is not navigable).

The section of the Ulster Canal connecting Lough Erne to Clones is being planned for navigation to be restored by Waterways Ireland.

<doc id="474709" wikidata="Q6112786" url="?curid=474709" title="Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test">
<text>The Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test (SweSAT)() is a standardised test used as one of the means to gain admission to higher education in Sweden. The test itself, which is administered by the Swedish Council for Higher Education, is divided into a mathematical part and a verbal part, which both respectively contain 4 subdivisions, in total 160 multiple-choice questions. All sections are taken in one day, a Saturday in April (Spring test) or a Sunday in October (Autumn test), lasting between 7½ and 8 hours including breaks between each section and a lunch break. Apart from the English language reading comprehension test, all sections are taken in Swedish.

==Evaluation and norming==
The result on the test is normalised to a scale between 0.0 and 2.0, with 0.05 s. About 0.1% of the test-takers are awarded 2.0, which is the highest grade. Usually, 145 to 150 marks (out of 160) are required for 2.0. The average normated score for the test is normally around 0.87, and the standard deviation is about 0.40, resulting in approximately two thirds of the test takers receiving a result in the interval 0.50–1.30, and 95% receiving a result between 0.20 and 1.70.

After each of the five tests, participants are given a brief moment to copy their answers onto an orange paper. Since autumn 2016, the correct answers to the test are posted on the Swedish Council for Higher Education&#x27;s website, studera.nu, the following Wednesday from the day of the test, which always takes place on Saturday or Sunday.

Prior to autumn 2016, the answers to the test were posted the same day as the exam on studera.nu, the högskoleprovet website, as well as in the evening newspapers and the following day in morning newspapers. Solutions could also be found in SVT&#x27;s text-TV.

The decision to postpone the release of the solutions was made in order to prevent strategic cheating that had been noticed during previous tests.

== The current test (since autumn 2011) ==
The test is since autumn 2011 divided into two parts - a quantitative and a verbal part of 80 questions each. The quantitative and the verbal parts are both divided into four sections each with different types of questions. The test has a total of 160 questions, divided into four subtests of 40 questions each. Two of the subtests contains questions from the quantitative part of the test. The other two subtests contains questions from the verbal part. A fifth subtest is also given in order to develop new questions for future tests, but the result from this subtest is not counted.

The test-takers are allowed to mark down their answers on an additional provided answer sheet, in addition to the sheet that they hand in to test supervisor after every subtest, and bring this with them after the test is completed. In this way they can compare their answers to the test key which is later published on the internet, teletext and newspapers. This only allows the test-takers to find out their raw score, as opposed to the normalised score which is used for university applications, but by comparing this results to the normalisation tables of prior tests an estimate can be made.

=== Quantitative part (40+40 questions) ===
#XYZ – Mathematical problem-solving. This section examines the ability to solve mathematical problems in the areas of arithmetic, algebra, geometry, function theory and statistics. The section consists of 24 questions out of the total 160.
#QC – Quantitative comparisons (in Swedish: KVA). This section examines the ability to make quantitative comparisons in the areas of arithmetic, algebra, geometry, function theory and statistics. The section consists of 20 questions out of the total 160.
#DS – Data sufficiency (in Swedish: NOG). This section involves deciding whether enough information has been provided to solve a problem in arithmetic or geometry. The items require some mathematical skills, but is primarily aimed at testing the ability to draw logical conclusions. The section consists of 12 questions out of the total 160.
#DTM – Diagrams, tables and maps (in Swedish: DTK). This section measures the ability to interpret diagrams, tables and maps. The questions demand both the ability to identify information and to analyse data from different sources. The section consists of 24 questions out of the total 160.

=== Verbal part (40+40 questions) ===
#WORD – Vocabulary (in Swedish: ORD). This section tests awareness of the meaning of words and concepts. The words may be of Swedish or foreign origin. They may also be archaic or words that have come into use in Swedish in recent years. Some words are dialectal. The items are taken from many different subject areas, and may also include widely used technical terms. The section consists of 20 questions out of the total 160.
#READ – Swedish reading comprehension (in Swedish: LÄS). This section tests the ability to understand five different texts in Swedish. The questions require the capacity to perceive details in the text and also to draw conclusions from the text as a whole. The section consists of 20 questions out of the total 160.
#SEC – Sentence completion (in Swedish: MEK). This section examines the ability to put into words and phrases in context. The section consists of 20 questions out of the total 160.
#ERC – English reading comprehension (in Swedish: ELF). This section tests the ability to read and understand a non-fictitious text in English (often picked from newspapers or magazines). It contains both long and short texts. One of the longer tests is a &quot;Cloze test&quot;, which contains gaps where words have been omitted. The emphasis of this section is on the capacity to perceive information, follow an argument and draw conclusions on the basis of the text in English. The section consists of 20 questions out of the total 160.

=== The fifth subtest ===
At each test there is given an extra fifth subtest in order to develop new questions for future tests. This part consists of data from the aforementioned sections, but the result from this subtest is not counted. Which subtest was the test part is revealed after the whole test is concluded.

== Older versions of SweSAT ==

=== 1977–1991 ===
The purpose with the very first test, from 1977, was to provide upper-secondary school students with a &quot;second chance&quot;, and to act as a selection instrument for candidates with at least 25 years of age and four years of work experience (known as &quot;25/4:s&quot;). While the test was open for anyone to take, and free of charge, only the 25/4:s could use their scores for selection to higher education.

The first test consisted of 150 questions within six subtests: &quot;Vocabulary&quot; (WORD – 30 questions), &quot;Data sufficiency&quot; (DS – 20 questions), &quot;Reading comprehension&quot; (READ – 30 questions), &quot;Diagrams, tables and maps&quot; (DTM – 20 questions), &quot;General information&quot; (GI – 30 questions) and &quot;Study techniques&quot; (STECH – 20 questions). The latter was a verbal test in which the items asked for one or several pieces of information that could be found in an accompanying pamphlet complete with a table of contents and registers. The pamphlet was around 80 pages, and too time-consuming to read in its entirety, so test-takers had to use registers to find the requested information. As such it was the subtest most closely reflecting normal study situations.

Quite soon the original READ subtest proved to easy for test takers. In 1980 its True/False answer format was changed to the multiple-choice format that was already used in the other subtests, and the number of READ-items was reduced from 30 to 24.

=== 1991–1996 ===
After the trial period ended in 1991, the SweSAT could be used for selection purposes by all candidates to higher education – now even more than before acting as a &quot;second chance&quot; for students with uncompetitive grade point average.

Now the STECH subtest was replaced by &quot;English reading comprehension&quot; (ERC) with 24 questions. Another change concerned the evaluation of new questions. So far, items had been tried out on separate occasions, using students from upper-secondary school (who might be more, but probably less motivated than regular test-takers). From now on newly developed items would be included in the regular test in a try-out block, that do not count toward the test score. Test takers do not know which block is the try-out block until after the test.

=== 1996–2011 ===
From 1996 to autumn 2011 the test was divided into five sections. Each was given in subtests lasting 50 minutes, with the exception of the ERC and WORD sections being grouped into one subtest (35 and 15 minutes, respectively). One of these subtests were given twice, with only one of these being counted towards the test-takers&#x27; total scores and the other section was being used to evaluate questions for future tests, with the test-takers being unaware of which section being counted towards their total.

==== Sections ====
#DTM – Diagrams, tables and maps. This section measures the ability to interpret diagrams, tables and maps. The questions demand both the ability to identify information and to analyse data from different sources. The section consists of 20 or 24 questions out of the total 122. (50 minutes)

<doc id="474710" wikidata="Q190550" url="?curid=474710" title="Moravian-Silesian Region">
<text>The Moravian-Silesian Region () is one of the 14 administrative regions of the Czech Republic. Before May 2001, it was called the Ostrava Region (). The region is located in the north-eastern part of its historical region of Moravia and in most of the Czech part of the historical region of Silesia. The region borders the Olomouc Region to the west and the Zlín Region to the south. It also borders two other countries – Poland (Opole and Silesian Voivodeships) to the north and Slovakia (Žilina Region) to the east.

It is a highly industrialized region, its capital Ostrava was actually called the &quot;Steel Heart of the Republic&quot;. In addition, it has several mountainous areas where the landscape is relatively preserved. Nowadays, the economy of the region benefits from its location in the Czech/Polish/Slovak borderlands.

== Administrative division ==
Traditionally, the region has been divided into six districts () which still exist as regional units, though most administration has been shifted to the municipalities with extended competence and the municipalities with commissioned local authority. (There are a total of 300 municipalities (39 are towns).)


=== Municipalities with extended competence ===
Since 1 January 2003, the region has been divided into 22 municipalities with extended competence, which took over most of the administration of the former district authorities. Some of these are further divided into municipalities with commissioned local authority. They are unofficially named little districts (). They are:
* Bílovec
* Bohumín
* Bruntál
* Český Těšín
* Frenštát pod Radhoštěm
* Frýdek-Místek
* Frýdlant nad Ostravicí
* Havířov
* Hlučín
* Jablunkov
* Karviná
* Kopřivnice
* Kravaře
* Krnov
* Nový Jičín
* Odry
* Opava
* Orlová
* Ostrava
* Rýmařov
* Třinec
* Vítkov
== Population ==
The total population of the region was 1,203,292 (men 49.1%, women 50.9%) in 2019, which makes it the third most populous region in the Czech Republic; 86.9% are Czechs, 3.3% Slovaks, 3.0% Poles, 2.3% Moravians, 0.8% Silesians, 0.3% Germans, and 0.2% Romani, though this last figure might be considerably higher, as Romani often do not officially admit their ethnicity. Around 40.2% of the population is religious, mostly Roman Catholic, while 52.3% declares as atheist.

The population density is 222 inhabitants per km2, which is the second-highest in the country, after the capital Prague. Most of the population is urban, with 59% living in towns with over 20,000 inhabitants. The average age of the population in the region was 42.7 in 2019.

===Cities and towns===
The table shows cities and towns in the region with the largest population (as of 1 January 2024):


==Economy==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 19.6 billion € in 2018, accounting for 9.5% of Czech economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 23,000 € or 76% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 74% of the EU average.

==Geography==
The geography of the region varies considerably, comprising many land forms from lowlands to high mountains whose summits lie above the tree line.

In the west lie the Hrubý Jeseník mountains, with the highest mountain of the region (and all Moravia), Praděd, rising . The mountains are heavily forested, with many spectacular places and famous spas such as Karlova Studánka and Jeseník, so are very popular with tourists. Also, several ski resorts are there, including Červenohorské Sedlo and Ovčárna, with long-lasting snow cover. The Hrubý Jeseník mountains slowly merge into the rolling hills of the Nízký Jeseníks and Oderské Vrchy, rising to 800 m at Slunečná and 680 m at Fidlův Kopec, respectively.

To the east, the landscape gradually descends into the Moravian Gate valley with the Bečva and Oder Rivers. The former flows to the south-west, the latter to the north-east, where the terrain spreads into the flat Ostrava Basin and Opava Hilly Land, where most of the population lives. The region&#x27;s heavy industry, which has been in decline for the last decade, is located there, too, benefiting from huge deposits of hard coal. The confluence of the Odra and Olza is the lowest point of the region, at 195 m.

To the south-east, towards the Slovakian border, the landscape sharply rises into the Moravian-Silesian Beskids, with its highest mountain Lysá hora at , which is the place with the highest annual rainfall in the Czech Republic, a year. The mountains are heavily forested and serve as a holiday resort for the industrial north.

===Nature conservation===
Three large landscape protected areas and a number of smaller nature reserves are in the region. The countryside is mostly man-made, but five natural parks with preserved natural scenery exist.

The Jeseníky PLA (with an area of ) lies in the mountain range of the same name in the north east of the region. The terrain is very diverse, with steep slopes and deep valleys. About 80%t of the area is forested, mostly by secondary plantations of Norway spruce, which were seriously damaged by industrial emissions. Due to local weather conditions, the tree line in the area descends to . Alpine meadows can be found in particularly low elevations in the Jeseník mountains. Also, a few peat moors are found there, which are otherwise nonexistent in Moravia.

The Poodří PLA () lies in the Moravian Gate, in close proximity to the region&#x27;s capital Ostrava, on the banks of the meandering Odra. It is an area of floodplain forests (one of the last preserved in Central Europe), flooded meadows, and many shallow ponds, on which water birds thrive.

The Beskydy PLA () is the largest Czech PLA. It lies in the south-east of the region, along the Slovakian boundary. In the north, the mountains rise steeply from the Ostrava basin, to the south their elevation and severity decreases. Most of the area is forested, mainly by Norway spruce plantations, which are not indigenous to the area. Many of these were severely damaged by emissions from the Ostrava industrial region. There are, however, also a lot of either newly planted or preserved forests of European beech, which in the past covered most of the mountains. The PLA is typical by its mosaic of forests and highland meadows and pastures with hamlets scattered throughout all the mountains. In recent years bear and wolf sighting have become more frequent.

Altogether, 125 small, protected nature areas cover an area of . The most notable of them is the lime Šipka Cave near Štramberk, where remnants of a Neanderthal man were discovered in the late 19th century.

===Places of interest===

There are three towns with protected historical centers. Příbor, the birthplace of Sigmund Freud, was an important center of education for northern Moravia from the 17th century to the first half of the 20th. Nový Jičín, founded under the castle of Starý Jičín, has a well-preserved central square dating back to the 14th century, with the Žerotínský château nearby. Štramberk is a unique small town nestled in a valley between lime hills, with many timber houses and the Trúba Spire rising on a hill above the town.

Many castles and châteaus are in the region, the most famous being Hradec nad Moravicí, Raduň, Kravaře, and Fulnek. Hukvaldy, in a village of the same name under the Moravian-Silesian Beskids, is one of the region&#x27;s many castle ruins, known for a musical festival dedicated to the composer Leoš Janáček, who was born there. Another well-known castle ruin is Sovinec under the Hrubý Jeseníks.

Due to the importance of industry in the region, many museums display products of local technical development. The Automobile Museum in Kopřivnice exhibits the history of the Tatra cars, The Train Carriage Museum is in Studénka, and the Mining Museum and the former Michal Mine (&quot;Důl Michal&quot;) are in Ostrava.

==History==
Until 2000, the current region did not exist as such, but was organized as part of a larger administrative unit called the North Moravian Region. Six of its districts, Bruntál, Frýdek-Místek, Karviná, Nový Jičín, Opava, and Ostrava, were in 2000 put into the newly established Moravian-Silesian Region. The old North Moravian Region still exists and jurisdiction of some administrative bodies is defined by its borders.

<text>Spring break is a vacation period at universities and schools that includes the Easter holiday, and takes place in early Northern Hemisphere spring. Introduced in the U.S. during the 1930s, spring break has been observed in Europe since the late 19th century, and is observed in many other countries. Spring break is associated with riotous partying at warm-weather locations.

==By country==

===Asia===
====Japan====
In Japan, the spring break starts with the end of the academic year in late March and ends around April 7 with the beginning of a new academic year.

==== Hong Kong ====
Hong Kong follows the British tradition of an Easter break of about one and a half weeks.

==== Iran ====
In Iran, spring break starts at Nowruz and ends on Sizdah Bedar, All Iranians have the same spring break.

==== Macau ====
Macau follows the Portuguese tradition of Easter break.

====South Korea====
In South Korea, the spring break originally lasted for two weeks in February with the new school year starting afterwards in March. However, due to a change in the academic calendar in 2015, the spring break was changed to a 1-week break in the first week of May, around Children&#x27;s Day (although some schools still keep it in February).

Colleges only take the Children&#x27;s Day itself off.

==== Taiwan ====
In Taiwan, spring break usually refers to the consecutive days off of Tomb Sweeping Day and Children&#x27;s Day.

==== UAE (United Arab Emirates) ====
In UAE, spring break is usually two or three weeks long from late March to early/middle of April. It usually depends on the school or the emirate.

===Europe===
====Czech Republic====
In the Czech Republic, only primary and secondary school students have a spring break. The break is one week long and the date of the break differs from county to county to avoid overcrowding of the break destinations in the Czech Republic (Czechs usually travel to the mountains to ski there). The counties are divided into six groups, each group containing counties evenly distributed across the country. The first group starts the holiday on the first Monday of February, the last group starts the holiday five weeks later (usually in early March). The last group of counties becomes the first one to have the spring break the next year.

====Georgia====
Before 2017, the spring break in Georgia was typically an Easter holiday, lasting from Thursday to Tuesday in Holy Week. In 2017 Minister of Education and Science Aleksandre Jejelava instead set the period from March 8 to 15 as a holiday for those in education, from preschool to university.

====Germany====
In Germany, universities typically schedule a semester break of five to eight weeks around March. The Whitsun (Pentecost) holidays around late May or early June are also considered a spring break.

====Greece====
In Greece, spring break takes place during Holy Week and the week following.

====Lithuania====
In Lithuania, spring break (called Easter holidays or spring holidays) takes place one week before Easter and one day after it (as it is the second day of Easter), all school students have this vacation. Primary school students have another week of holidays after Easter.

====The Netherlands====

In the Netherlands, a week-long break is given to high school students and students in higher education in the early stages of spring (February-March). There are regional differences between mostly the north and south of the country in when this break takes place, because of carnival, which is mostly celebrated in the southern parts of The Netherlands.

====Portugal====
In Portugal, spring break is mostly known as &quot;Easter Holidays&quot; and it gives two weeks to all students around the country.

====Russia====
Before 1917 there was an Easter Break in schools. In the Soviet Union, spring break was always from March 24 to 31. Now, many schools in Russia still have the spring break, but the exact date is decided by the school itself. In the majority of cases it is set in the middle of April. Also, the public holidays in May, connected with Labour day and Victory day, can be an accurate equivalent of the spring break.

==== Slovakia ====
Slovakia gives a week-long break to its elementary school and secondary school students in the months of February and March. Instead of vacationing in warm weather destinations, Slovaks mostly associate spring breaks with skiing. The break is one week long and the date of the break differs from region to region to avoid overcrowding of domestic break destinations. The regions are divided into three groups, the first group starts the holiday on the end of February, the last group starts the holiday two weeks later (in early March).

There is also another shorter Easter break from Holy Thursday to Easter Tuesday.

====Spain====
In Spain, there is no spring break as such; Holy Week is celebrated, and students usually have holidays during these days.

====United Kingdom====
The Easter Break is typically over 2 weeks in either late March or April, depending on when Easter Sunday falls.

===North America===
====Canada====
Canadian provinces give a one or two-week-long break to its elementary school and secondary school students in the month of March, with the time varying from province to province; New Brunswick and Quebec, for example, place their March breaks during the first week of March; Nova Scotia, and British Columbia schedule theirs during the second or third week; the break in Alberta and Manitoba usually occurs in the last week of March. 

In primary and secondary school, this break is called &quot;March break&quot; and in higher education it is usually &quot;reading week&quot; or &quot;reading break&quot;. Neither example is commonly associated with the party culture of American spring break. &quot;Mid-term break&quot; is a generic term. Reading week in Canada usually coincides with Family Day in the month of February.

====Jamaica====
In Jamaica, the spring break starts in the first week of Good Friday. The break may range from one week to two weeks, often two. This break starts depending on which month the Easter holiday begins, March or April.

====Mexico====
In Mexico, spring break takes place during the Holy Week and the one after it.

====United States====
 Now, spring break is an academic tradition in various mostly western countries that is scheduled for different periods depending on the state and sometimes the region.

In the United States, spring break at universities, colleges, and many K-12 school systems can take place depending on term dates and when Easter holiday falls. Spring break is usually a week or two long, although some schools schedule it for mid to late March, with separate days off for the Easter holiday.

=====Panama City Beach, Florida=====
Starting in the late 1990s, Panama City Beach began advertising the destination hoping to attract crowds that had formerly gone to Fort Lauderdale and then Daytona Beach before those communities enacted restrictions. From 2010 to 2016, an estimated 300,000 students traveled to the destination. The spawn of social media and digital marketing helped boost the beach town into a student mecca during March. Following well-publicized shootings and a gang rape in 2015, several new ordinances were put into effect prohibiting drinking on the beach and establishing a bar closing time of 2a.m.CT. Reports showed a drop in Panama City Beach&#x27;s spring break turnout in March 2016, followed by increased family tourism in April 2016. Both are attributed to the new ordinances by the Bay County Community Development Corporation (CDC).

=====Daytona Beach, Florida=====
After Fort Lauderdale started discouraging college students from vacationing there for spring break in the mid-1980s, Daytona Beach mayor Larry Kelly appeared on national television to encourage college vacationers to come to Daytona Beach instead. Soon after, beer and cigarette brands started advertising in Daytona Beach for spring break. &quot;MTV Spring Break&quot; coverage moved to Daytona Beach in 1986.

Kelly later called that decision a mistake, as locals experienced many problems during spring break every year. Kelly&#x27;s efforts to rein in the revelry included promoting athletic competitions called &quot;Spring Games&quot; to channel youthful energy in a wholesome direction, and proposing that hotels be billed for the cost of sending police to respond to calls during spring break. In 1993, Kelly lost his bid for re-election as mayor, and Daytona Beach officials cut their spring break marketing budget and ties with MTV.

=====Fort Lauderdale, Florida=====
Fort Lauderdale&#x27;s reputation as a spring break destination for college students started when the Colgate University men&#x27;s swim team arrived to practice there over Christmas break in 1934. Attracting approximately 20,000 college students in the 1950s, spring break was still known as &#x27;Spring vacation&#x27; and was a relatively low key affair. This began to change when Glendon Swarthout&#x27;s novel, &quot;Where the Boys Are&quot; was published in 1960, effectively ushering in modern spring break. Swarthout&#x27;s 1960 novel was quickly made into a movie of the same title later that year, &quot;Where the Boys Are&quot;, in which college girls met boys while on spring break there. The number of visiting college students immediately jumped to over 50,000. By the early 1980s, Fort Lauderdale was attracting between 250,000 and 350,000 college students per year during spring break. Residents of the Fort Lauderdale area became so upset at the damage done by college students that the local government passed laws restricting parties in 1985. At the same time, the National Minimum Drinking Age Act was enacted in the United States, requiring that Florida raise the minimum drinking age from 18 to 21 and inspiring many underage college vacationers to travel to other competing locations in the United States for spring break. By 1989, the number of college students traveling to Fort Lauderdale fell to 20,000, a far cry from the 350,000 who went four years prior.

=====South Padre Island, Texas=====
In the early 1980s, South Padre Island became the first location outside of Florida to draw a large number of college students for spring break. With only a few thousand residents, South Padre Island consistently drew 80,000 to 120,000 spring breakers into the 2000s.

==Corporate marketing==
It is common for major brands that cater to the youth market, such as Coca-Cola, Gillette, MTV, and branches of the United States Armed Forces, to market at spring break destinations.

<text>Quartz 2D is the native two-dimensional graphics rendering API for macOS and iOS platforms, part of the Core Graphics framework.

==Overview==
Quartz 2D is available to all macOS and iOS application environments and provides resolution-independent and device-independent rendering of bitmap graphics, text, and vectors both on-screen and in preparation for printing. Its responsibilities within the graphics layer include:
* Rendering text
* Displaying, manipulating, and rendering PDF documents
* Converting PostScript data to PDF data, and vice versa
* Displaying, manipulating, and rendering bitmap images
* Providing color management via ColorSync
* Displaying the elements of the Aqua user interface
Because Quartz 2D is one of several Quartz Technologies, the term &quot;Quartz&quot; by itself must be taken in context.

==Drawing in Quartz 2D==

Quartz 2D expands the drawing functions associated with QuickDraw. The most notable difference is that Quartz 2D eliminates output device and resolution specificity.

The drawing model utilized by Quartz 2D is based on PDF specification 1.4. Drawing takes place using a Cartesian coordinate system, where text, vectors, or bitmap images are placed on a grid. However, drawing output is not sent directly to the output device. Quartz 2D uses graphics contexts, environments in which drawing takes place. Each graphics context defines how the drawing should be presented: in a window, sent to a printer, an OpenGL layer, or off-screen. Each context rasterizes the drawing at the desired resolution without altering the data that defines the drawing. Thus, contexts are the mechanism by which Quartz 2D employs resolution- and device-independence. For example, a window context may rasterize an object to the appropriate screen resolution to create actual graphics on the display. The same object can be sent to a printing context at a much higher resolution. This permits the same graphics commands to yield output on any device using the most appropriate resolution.

==History==
Quartz 2D is similar to NeXT&#x27;s Display PostScript in its use of contexts. It first appeared as the 2D graphics rendering library called Core Graphics Rendering; along with Core Graphics Services (Compositing), it was wrapped into the initial incarnation of Quartz. Quartz (and its renderer) were first demonstrated at WWDC in May 1999.

Presently, the name &quot;Quartz 2D&quot; more precisely defines the 2D rendering capabilities of Core Graphics (Quartz). With the release of Mac OS X 10.2, marketing attention focused on Quartz Extreme, the composition layer, leaving the term &quot;Quartz&quot; to refer to the Core Graphics framework or just its 2D renderer. Presently, &quot;Quartz&quot; technologies can describe all of the rendering and compositing technologies introduced by macOS (including Core Image for example).

Prior to Mac OS X Tiger, QuickDraw rendering outperformed that of Quartz 2D. Mac OS X 10.4 rectified this, substantially increasing the standard rendering performance of Quartz 2D. Tiger also introduced Quartz 2D Extreme: optional graphics processor (GPU) acceleration for Quartz 2D, although it is not an officially supported feature. Quartz 2D Extreme is disabled by default in Mac OS X 10.4 because it may lead to video redraw issues or kernel panics. In Mac OS X Leopard, Quartz 2D Extreme was renamed QuartzGL.

<doc id="474719" wikidata="Q5754993" url="?curid=474719" title="High Button Shoes">
<text>High Button Shoes is a 1947 musical with music by Jule Styne, lyrics by Sammy Cahn and book by George Abbott and Stephen Longstreet. It was based on the semi-autobiographical 1946 novel &quot;The Sisters Liked Them Handsome&quot; by Stephen Longstreet. The story concerns the comic entanglements of the Longstreet family with two con men in Atlantic City.

The musical opened on Broadway in 1947 (running for 727 performances), and in London&#x27;s West End in 1948, and has had several regional revivals as well as being televised in 1956.

==History==
Many involved with &quot;High Button Shoes&quot; were Broadway first-timers or relatively unknown, except for the director, George Abbott. The creative team, composer Jule Styne, lyricist Sammy Cahn and writer Stephen Longstreet had worked in Hollywood, as had the producers Monte Proser and Joseph Kipness (who had also produced several short-lived Broadway shows) and actors Phil Silvers, who was known for his on-screen con-man persona, and Nanette Fabray. The designers Oliver Smith and Miles White and choreographer Jerome Robbins were all Broadway veterans. Rumors circulated that the book by Longstreet was &quot;hopeless&quot; and that Abbott and Silvers were &quot;heavily rewriting&quot; it. The Shuberts, involved because the show was to play in one of their theaters, approved an increase in Abbott&#x27;s percentage to include author&#x27;s royalties. Historian Ken Mandelbaum agrees that the show&#x27;s book was originally by Longstreet but that it was extensively rewritten by Abbott.

==Synopsis==
In New Brunswick, New Jersey in 1913, the Longstreet family, consisting of Mama, Papa, Mama&#x27;s younger sister Fran, and her college boyfriend Oggle, is affected when a con man, Harrison Floy, and his shill, Mr. Pontdue, come to town. The duos&#x27; dubious intentions are made clear as Floy pitches &quot;snake-oil&quot; schemes (&quot;He Tried to Make a Dollar&quot;) including selling fake watches and diamond mines, and the shill Mr. Pontdue asks for &quot;two.&quot; They are chased by the police, and the phony scheme is repeated. After they cheat the Longstreets in a phony land deal, Floy and Pontdue try to escape to Atlantic City, New Jersey with their ill-gotten profits and also take Fran (who has become romantically involved with Floy) with them. 

As the con men Floy and Pontdue are pursued to the Atlantic City beach while carrying a satchel full of stolen money, the people on the beach dance around them (&quot;The Bathing Beauty Ballet&quot;). They tangle with a large number of people—including bathing beauties, lifeguards, other criminals, identical twins—and one gorilla. The climax occurs when the Keystone Cops arrive, and Floy loses everything when he bets on the wrong football team. But after his being captured we learn that Pontdue has bet on not a football team, but a filly named &quot;Princeton.&quot; Floy gives the conned citizens their money back, but before he leaves tries to get the audience to buy one more item of &quot;great worth...&quot;

==Dance elements==
The highlight of the original production was a long (7- to 10-minute) ensemble dance number (&quot;The Bathing Beauty Ballet&quot;, to the song &quot;On a Sunday by the Sea&quot;) at the beginning of the second act. Choreographer Robbins staged this number in the manner of a Mack Sennett silent slapstick film. It uses the music of &quot;On A Sunday By the Sea&quot;, Liszt&#x27;s Second Hungarian Rhapsody, and Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;can-can&quot; from &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot;. &quot;This number was so basic to the show that deleting it would render the evening incoherent. It was a major evocation of a period, a tribute to silent-film comedy.&quot; Amanda Vaill, in her biography of Robbins, describes this dance number: &quot;The actors careen across the stage, in and out of a row of boardwalk bathhouses, slamming doors, falling, rolling, leaping to their feet, colliding with one another, in a masterpiece of intricately plotted chaos that bears all the marks of the developing Robbins style: wit, character, drama, and precision.&quot;

==Productions==
&quot;High Button Shoes&quot; opened on Broadway at the New Century Theatre October 9, 1947, it transferred to the Shubert Theatre December 22, 1947, then to The Broadway Theatre October 18, 1948, before closing July 2, 1949, after 727 performances. The cast starred Silvers as Harrison Floy and Fabray as Sara Longstreet (who was replaced by Joan Roberts in June 1948), and featured Joey Faye as Mr. Pontdue and Jack McCauley as Henry (Papa) Longstreet. The direction was by Abbott, choreography by Jerome Robbins, scenic design by Oliver Smith, costume design by Miles White, and lighting design by Peggy Clark. Robbins won the Tony Award for choreography.

The U.S. national tour ran in parallel with the Broadway shows, with Eddie Foy Jr. as Harrison Floy, Audrey Meadows as Sara &quot;Mama&quot; Longstreet and Jack Whiting as Henry &quot;Papa&quot; Longstreet. It opened at the Boston Opera House April 26, 1948, played at least 16 cities in the Midwest and Great Plains, including Chicago, Denver and Minneapolis, as well as Los Angeles on August 15, 1949, and closed December 31, 1949, in Kansas City.

A London production opened at the Hippodrome December 22, 1948, and ran for 291 performances. Two unknowns, Audrey Hepburn and Alma Cogan, were among the chorus girls.

A television adaptation was broadcast live November 24, 1956, on NBC with Nanette Fabray and Joey Faye repeating their original roles, Hal March as Harrison Floy and Don Ameche as Papa Longstreet.

The musical was revived at the Goodspeed Opera House, East Haddam, Connecticut July 1982 through September 11, 1982. Goodspeed Musicals revived the work again, July 13 through September 22, 2007.

More recently, the musical was revived again at the New York City Center on May 8–12, 2019.

== Principal casts ==
==Response==
Brooks Atkinson, theatre critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote that it was a &quot;very happy musical show in a very cheerful tradition.&quot; He particularly praised Phil Silvers&#x27; performance as &quot;an uproarious comic. He has the speed, the drollery and the shell-game style of a honky-tonk buffoon.&quot; He commented that the story was a &quot;sentimentally amusing fable&quot; and that the songs were &quot;simple in style and very pleasant to hear.&quot;

<text>Stanley Ho Hung-sun (; 25 November 192126 May 2020) was a Hong Kong and Macau billionaire businessman. He was the founder and chairman of SJM Holdings, which owns nineteen casinos in Macau including the Grand Lisboa.

Ho was nicknamed variously &quot;Godfather&quot; and &quot;King of Gambling&quot;, reflecting the government-granted monopoly he held on the Macau gambling industry for 40 years. His wealth was divided among his daughter, Pansy Ho ($5.3 billion) who owns MGM Macau, fourth wife Angela Leong ($4.1 billion) who is managing director of SJM Holdings, and son Lawrence Ho ($2.6 billion) who owns City of Dreams.

Ho was the founder and chairman of Shun Tak Holdings, through which he owned many businesses including entertainment, tourism, shipping, real estate, banking, and air transport. It is estimated that his businesses employ almost one-fourth of the workforce of Macau. Apart from Hong Kong and Macau, he also invested in mainland China, Portugal, North Korea where he operated a casino, Vietnam, the Philippines, Mozambique, Indonesia and East Timor.

His opinions and statements on Hong Kong&#x27;s real estate and commercial development had considerable sway on the market. In his later years, he had been involved in litigation with his sister, Winnie Ho, concerning the ownership of the Macau casino. Having suffered a stroke in July 2009, followed by a long period of recovery, Ho began steps in late 2010 to devolve his grip on his financial empire to his various wives and children. Ho died on 26 May 2020 at the Hong Kong Sanatorium &amp; Hospital.

== Early life ==
Born in Hong Kong during British colonial rule, he was of Chinese, Dutch-Jewish and English ancestry. Ho was descended from his great-grandfather, Charles Henry Maurice Bosman (1839–1892), who was of Dutch Jewish ancestry, and his Chinese mistress Sze Tai (施娣), a local Bao&#x27;an (present-day Shenzhen and Hong Kong) woman. His grandfather was Ho Fook (何福), brother of the merchant Sir Robert Ho Tung. Ho was the ninth of thirteen children of Ho Sai-kwong (何世光).

=== Education ===
Ho studied at Queen&#x27;s College, Hong Kong, at which he attended Class D - the lowest class level in the then Hong Kong Class System - owing to unsatisfactory academic results. However, he later received a scholarship to the University of Hong Kong. He became the first student from Class D to be granted a university scholarship. His university studies were cut short by the outbreak of World War II in 1942. Following the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, Ho moved to Macau.

=== Career ===
Ho began clerical work at a Japanese-owned import-export firm in Macau. He made his first fortune smuggling luxury goods and food across the Chinese border from Macau during World War II. In 1943 he set up a kerosene company and established a construction company with his money.

Ho, along with partners including Hong Kong tycoon Henry Fok, Macau gambler Yip Hon and his brother-in-law Teddy Yip, bid for Macau franchises. By bidding high and promising to promote tourism and to develop infrastructure, they won the public tender for Macau&#x27;s gaming monopoly license in 1961, for US$410,000, of which US$51,000 was provided by Henry Fok. defeating the long-time Macau casino barons, the Fu family, by MOP 17,000. In 1961 the company was renamed Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau, S.A.R.L. (STDM). 

In late 1962, Ho opened the Estoril Hotel, Macau&#x27;s first luxury casino resort.

In 1970, Ho opened the flagship Lisboa Casino Hotel. In the same year, Ho also set up Shun Tak Holdings Ltd, which was listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. Through a subsidiary, TurboJET, it owns one of the world&#x27;s largest fleets of high-speed jetfoils, which ferry passengers between Hong Kong and Macau.

In the 1980s, Ho pioneered the practice of subcontracting private gambling rooms in his casinos to independent agents. The practice developed in response to Triads&#x27; practice of buying hydrofoil tickets to scalp to tourists. Ho&#x27;s practice developed as an alternative, which would allow Triad agents direct access to his casinos instead via commissions on sales of casino chips to gamblers. This practice evolved into the VIP contractual system known as the junket trade.

Ho&#x27;s investments in Macau were diverse. In 1989, after STDM took full control of the Macau Jockey Club, Ho became its chairman and chief executive officer.

Ho opened a casino in Pyongyang, North Korea, in 1995.

In 1998 Ho became the first living Macanese resident to have a local street named after him. He also launched Asia&#x27;s first football and basketball lottery, called SLOT.

Ho was named by the Canadian Government, citing the &quot;Manila Standard&quot; newspaper, as having a link to the Kung Lok Triad (Chinese mafia) and as being linked to &quot;several illegal activities&quot; during the period 1999–2002. Ho&#x27;s alleged ties to Chinese organized crime have also been reported by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, citing a U.S. Senate committee and several government agencies, when the state investigated his ties to American casino operator MGM Mirage.

In 1987, Portugal agreed to return Macau to China in 1999. Ho took part in the joint advisory committee. He was a Standing Committee member of the 9th National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference.

Also;
* Member of the Selection Committee for the first Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
* Member of the Consultative Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR

=== Family ===
Ho had 17 children born to four women. Ho referred to his children&#x27;s mothers as his wives. Some forms of Polygamy remained legal in Hong Kong until it was outlawed in 1971.

In 1942, Ho married Clementina Ângela Leitão, from the prestigious Portuguese Leitão family (Chinese:黎登)– her grandfather was a lawyer and Macau&#x27;s only notary public at the time. They had four children. Leitão was involved in a motor vehicle accident in 1973, and suffered partial memory loss as a result. In 1981, Ho&#x27;s and Leitão&#x27;s son Robert and daughter-in-law Suki Potier died in a car accident. Clementina Leitão Ho died in 2004 and was buried in the St. Michael the Archangel Cemetery (Portuguese: Cemitério São Miguel Arcanjo).

In the late 1950s, Ho met Lucina Azul Jean Ying née Laam King-ying (藍瓊纓) and began a relationship. This union was recognized in Macau and Hong Kong at that time due to legacy rulings from the Great Qing Legal Code of the Chinese Qing Dynasty. The relationship resulted in five children including daughters Daisy Ho, to whom Ho ceded the chairmanship of SJM, and Pansy Ho, a 50 percent partner in MGM Macau; son Lawrence Ho, CEO of Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd, another Macau-based casino company; and Josie Ho (何超儀), a rock singer and award-winning actress. Lucina&#x27;s family now resides in Canada.

Ho began a relationship with Ina Chan in 1985. This union is not legitimate by laws in either Hong Kong or Macau. Ho&#x27;s wife Clementina Leitão needed constant nursing care following her car accident, and Ina Chan was one of the nurses brought in to look after Leitão. Ho and Chan have three children together; Laurinda Ho, Florinda Ho, and Orlando Ho.

In 1988, Ho met Angela Leong On-kei when she was his dance instructor. The couple had four children together: Sabrina Ho, Arnaldo Ho, Mario Ho and Alice Ho. Leong is now an incumbent member of the Legislative Assembly in Macau.

== Personal life ==
Over the years, dancing was one of Ho&#x27;s favourite hobbies, he used to tango, cha-cha-cha, and waltz. He often danced for televised charity fundraisers and sponsored numerous dance performances in Hong Kong and Macau, including the Hong Kong Arts Festival and the Macau Arts Festival, promoting the art of dance. He also invited internationally renowned dancing groups, such as the National Ballet of China, to perform in Hong Kong and Macau. Ho was a patron of the Hong Kong Ballet, the International Dance Teachers Association and was a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Dance. One of a number of thoroughbred racehorses owned by Ho, Viva Pataca, named after the currency of Macau, won several top Hong Kong races in 2006 and 2007.

In late July 2009, Ho suffered a fall at his home that required brain surgery. For seven months Ho was confined to the Hong Kong Adventist Hospital and, later, the Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital, during which period he made only one public appearance, on 20 December 2009, when he travelled to Macau to meet Chinese president Hu Jintao on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of Macau&#x27;s return to Chinese sovereignty. Ho was discharged from the Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital on 6 March 2010 and thereafter employed a wheelchair.

=== Philanthropy ===

==== Qing relics ====
In 2003, Ho donated a Qing dynasty bronze boar&#x27;s head to China&#x27;s Poly Art Museum, a state-run organisation that aims to develop, display, rescue and protect Chinese cultural relics. The boar&#x27;s head is part of a collection of twelve looted from the imperial Summer Palace in
Beijing in 1860 when it was sacked and burnt by the French and British armies. On 21 September 2007, Ho donated to the Chinese government a Qing dynasty bronze sculpture of a horse&#x27;s head originally taken from the Old Summer Palace. Ho had reportedly just purchased it from a Taiwanese businessman for US$8.84 million.

===Lanceford dispute===
In late January 2011, a dispute erupted among his wives and children involving the transfer of ownership of his private holding company, Lanceford. On 27 December Lanceford allotted 9,998 new shares, representing 99.98 per cent of its enlarged share capital, to two British Virgin Islands companies: Action Winner Holdings Ltd, wholly owned by third wife, Ina, holding 50.55 per cent and Ranillo Investments Ltd, equally held by each of Laam&#x27;s five children, holding the balance. The allotment document filed with the Registrar of Companies was signed by Laam&#x27;s daughter Daisy.

Ho issued proceedings in the High Court, naming its directors – 11 defendants, including his second and third wives, and children Pansy and Lawrence Ho, alleging the group &quot;improperly and/or illegally&quot; acted in changing the share structure. The writ sought an injunction restraining the defendants from selling or disposing any of the 9,998 new shares in the company. The two British Virgin Islands companies were also named in the writ. Ho said his intention from the outset was to divide his assets equally among his families and that the actions of the directors of Lanceford effectively eliminated this possibility, according to a statement issued by his lawyer Gordon Oldham.

Amidst confusion caused by conflicting statements from Ho and his wives and children about the state of the dispute, Ho, through Oldham – who had been allegedly sacked and rehired within the space of a few days – said he had been pressured to make public statements and sign legal documents without him being fully apprised of their contents.

== Honours ==
In 1984, Ho was awarded an honorary doctorate of social sciences from the University of Macau in 1984. In the New Year Honours 1990, Ho was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (O.B.E.) &quot;for services to the community in Hong Kong&quot; In 1995, The Government of Portugal appointed Ho to the &quot;Grã-Cruz da Ordem do Infante Dom Henrique&quot; (Great Cross of the Order of Prince Henrique), the highest honour for any civilian, for his contributions to society. In 1998, Dr. Stanley Ho Avenue in Macau was named, the first Chinese person to be so honoured in Macau during their lifetime. In 2001, he was among the first recipients to receive the Golden Lotus Medal of Honour from Macau.

In 2003 Ho received the Gold Bauhinia Star from the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee Hwa. In 2007, he received the Grand Lotus Medal of Honour from Macau. In 2008 Ho received the Medal for Business Entrepreneurialism from the city of Cascais and the street running adjacent to the Estoril Casino was renamed as Avenida Stanley Ho. It was the first road in Portugal to be named after a living Chinese citizen. In June 2009 he received the Visionary award at the G2E Asia conference, organised by the American Gaming Association; the award was delivered by Macau SAR Chief Executive Edmund Ho. In November 2010, Ho was awarded the Grand Bauhinia Medal.

== Death ==
Ho was in poor health in his last years, and stayed in hospital after his health deteriorated following a stroke in 2009. On 25 May 2020, Ho was reported to be in a critical condition, and he died at the Hong Kong Sanatorium &amp; Hospital on 26 May 2020, at around 1 pm local time. He was 98.

<doc id="474724" wikidata="Q210960" url="?curid=474724" title="Gérard Debreu">
<text>Gérard Debreu (; 4 July 1921 – 31 December 2004) was a French-born economist and mathematician. Best known as a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, where he began work in 1962, he won the 1983 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.

==Biography==
His father was the business partner of his maternal grandfather in lace manufacturing, a traditional industry in Calais. Debreu was orphaned at an early age, as his father committed suicide and his mother died of natural causes. Prior to the start of World War II, he received his baccalauréat and went to Ambert to begin preparing for the entrance examination of a grande école. Later on, he moved from Ambert to Grenoble to complete his preparation, both places being in Vichy France during World War II. In 1941, he was admitted to the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, along with Marcel Boiteux. He was influenced by Henri Cartan and the Bourbaki writers. When he was about to take the final examinations in 1944, the Normandy landings occurred and he, instead, enlisted in the French army. He was transferred for training to Algeria and then served in the occupying French Forces in Germany until July 1945. 
Debreu passed the Agrégation de Mathématiques exams at the end of 1945 and the beginning of 1946. By this time, he had become interested in economics, particularly in the general equilibrium theory of Léon Walras. From 1946 to 1948, he was an assistant in the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. During these two and a half years, he made the transition from mathematics to economics. In 1948, Debreu went to the United States on a Rockefeller Fellowship which allowed him to visit several American universities, as well as those in Uppsala and Oslo in 1949–50. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Paris in 1956. In 1960 he became a professor at the University of California, where he taught until 1991.

Debreu married Françoise Bled in 1946 and they had two daughters, Chantal and Florence, born in 1946 and 1950 respectively.

Debreu died in Paris at the age of 83 of natural causes on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 2004.

==Academic career==
Debreu began working as a Research Associate and joined the Cowles Commission at the University of Chicago in the summer of 1950. He remained there for five years, returning to Paris periodically.

In 1954, he published a breakthrough paper, entitled &quot;Existence of an Equilibrium for a Competitive Economy&quot;, together with Kenneth Arrow, in which they provided a definitive mathematical proof of the existence of a general equilibrium, using topological rather than calculus-based methods.

In 1955, he moved to Yale University.

In 1959, he published his classical monograph, &quot;Theory of Value: An Axiomatic Analysis of Economic Equilibrium&quot; (Cowles Foundation Monographs Series), which is one of the most important works in mathematical economics. He also studied several problems in the theory of cardinal utility, in particular the additive decomposition of a utility function defined on a Cartesian product of sets.

In this monograph, Debreu set up an axiomatic foundation for competitive markets. He also established the existence of an equilibrium using a novel approach. The main idea of his argument is to show that there exists a price system for which the aggregate excess demand correspondence vanishes. He did so by proving a type of fixed-point theorem that is based on the Kakutani fixed-point theorem. In Chapter 7, Debreu introduced the concept of uncertainty and showed how it could be incorporated into the deterministic model. Here, he introduced the notion of a contingent commodity, which is a promise to deliver a good should a certain state of nature be realized. This concept is very frequently used in financial economics, where it is known as the &quot;Arrow–Debreu security&quot;.

In 1960–61, he worked at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford and devoted most of his time to the complex proof that appeared in 1962 of a general theorem on the existence of an economic equilibrium.

In January 1962, he started working at the University of California, Berkeley, where he held the titles of University Professor and Class of 1958 Professor of Economics and Mathematics Emeritus.

During his sabbaticals in the late 1960s and 1970s, he visited universities in Leiden, Cambridge, Bonn and Paris. In 1987, he visited the University of Canterbury as an Erskine Fellow, lecturing in economic theory.

His later studies centred mainly on the theory of differentiable economies, where he showed that, in general, aggregate excess demand functions vanish at a finite number of points – basically, he showed that economies have a finite number of price equilibria.

In 1976, he received the French Legion of Honour. He was awarded the 1983 Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, for having incorporated new analytical methods into economic theory and for his rigorous reformulation of general equilibrium theory. He was a member of the International Academy of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the United States National Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.

In 1990, he served as president of the American Economic Association.
