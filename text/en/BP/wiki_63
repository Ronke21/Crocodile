==Notes==
Of the 158 named rivers that flow through the State of Colorado, all but the Green River and Cimarron River have their headwaters in that state.

As of February 1, 2008, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names had identified 5,564 natural streams in the State of Colorado. Of this number, 147 larger streams (2.6%) were named &quot;river&quot; and 11 (0.2%) were named &quot;rio&quot;. The vast majority of the Colorado streams (5082 or 91.3%) were named &quot;creek&quot;. Of the remaining Colorado streams, 122 (2.2%) were named &quot;arroyo&quot;, 60 (1.1%) were named &quot;wash&quot;, 44 (0.8%) were named &quot;fork&quot;, 18 (0.3%) were named &quot;branch&quot;, 17 (0.3%) were named &quot;brook&quot;, 17 (0.3%) were named &quot;run&quot;, 15 (0.3%) were named &quot;rito&quot;, 10 (0.2%) were named &quot;slough&quot;, but not a single stream was named &quot;stream&quot;. Perhaps the most unusual river name in Colorado belongs to the West Fork East Fork Williams Fork located in Garfield County.

Many streams in Colorado share a name with another stream in the same state. In addition to the Canadian River that is the largest tributary of the Arkansas River, there is also a Canadian River that is a tributary of the North Platte River. In addition to the Cimarron River that is another major tributary of the Arkansas River, there is also a Cimarron River that is a tributary of the Gunnison River. There is a Fall River that is a tributary of the Big Thompson River as well as a Fall River that is a tributary of Clear Creek.

There are 72 streams in the State of Colorado that are named &quot;Willow Creek&quot;, 71 streams named &quot;Spring Creek&quot;, 53 streams named &quot;Cottonwood Creek&quot;, 49 streams named &quot;Bear Creek&quot;, 49 streams named &quot;Beaver Creek&quot;, 48 streams named &quot;Dry Creek&quot;, 33 streams named &quot;Rock Creek&quot;, 33 streams named &quot;Sand Creek&quot;, and 32 streams named &quot;Mill Creek&quot;. The Arkansas River and the Colorado River flow through Colorado, as do a Florida River, an Idaho Creek, an Illinois River, an Indiana Creek, a Maryland Creek, a Michigan River, a Minnesota Creek, six &quot;Missouri Creek&quot;s, a Montana Creek, two &quot;New York Creek&quot;s, two &quot;Ohio Creek&quot;s, two &quot;Pennsylvania Creek&quot;s, two &quot;Tennessee Creek&quot;s, seven &quot;Texas Creek&quot;s, and a Virginia Creek.

<text>Campeche is a state on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico that is divided into thirteen municipalities. According to the 2020 Mexican census, Campeche is the third least populous state with inhabitants and the 17th largest by land area spanning .

Municipalities in Campeche are administratively autonomous of the state according to the 115th article of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico. Every three years, citizens elect a municipal president (Spanish: &quot;presidente municipal&quot;) by a plurality voting system who heads a concurrently elected municipal council (&quot;ayuntamiento&quot;) responsible for providing all the public services for their constituents. The municipal council consists of a variable number of trustees and councillors (&quot;regidores y síndicos&quot;). Municipalities are responsible for public services (such as water and sewerage), street lighting, public safety, traffic, and the maintenance of public parks, gardens and cemeteries. They may also assist the state and federal governments in education, emergency fire and medical services, environmental protection and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks. Since 1984, they have had the power to collect property taxes and user fees, although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than from their own income.

The largest municipality by population in Campeche is the state capital Campeche, with 294,077 residents, while the smallest municipality by population is Palizada with 8,683 residents. The largest municipality by area is Calakmul, which spans , while Tenabo is the smallest at . The first municipalities to incorporate were Campeche, Carmen, and Hecelchakán on , and the newest municipalities are Dzitbalché and Seybaplaya, which incorporated .

<doc id="478909" wikidata="Q793079" url="?curid=478909" title="Ayllu">
<text>The ayllu, a family clan, is the traditional form of a community in the Andes, especially among Quechuas and Aymaras. They are an indigenous local government model across the Andes region of South America, particularly in Bolivia and Peru.

Ayllus functioned prior to Inca conquest, during the Inca and Spanish colonial period, and continue to exist to the present day – such as the Andean community Ocra. Membership gave individual families more variation and security on the land that they farmed. Ayllus had defined territories and were essentially extended family or kin groups, but could include non-related members. Their primary function was to solve subsistence issues, and issues of how to get along in family, and the larger community. Ayllus descended from stars in the Inca cosmogony, and just like stars had unique celestial locations, each ayllu had a terrestrial location defined by the paqarina, the mythical point of emergence of the lineage huaca.

==Current practice==
&quot;Ayllu&quot; is a word in both the Quechua and Aymara languages referring to a network of families in a given area, often with a putative or fictive common ancestor.
The male head of an &quot;ayllu&quot; is called a &quot;mallku&quot; which means, literally, “condor”, but is a title which can be more freely translated as “prince”.

Ayllus are distinguished by comparative self-sufficiency, commonly held territory, and relations of reciprocity. Members engage in shared collective labor for outside institutions (mit&#x27;a), in reciprocal exchanges of assistance () as well as community labor tribute (mink&#x27;a, ).
“Ayllu solidarity is a combination of kinship and territorial ties, as well as symbolism. (Albo 1972; Duviols 1974; Tshopik 1951; and Urioste 1975). These studies, however, do not explain how the ayllu is a corporate whole, which includes social principles, verticality, and metaphor ...Ayllu also refers to people who live in [a shared] territory (&quot;llahta&quot;) and who feed the earth shrines of that territory.”
In Bolivia, representatives from the ayllus are sent to the National Council of Ayllus and Markas of Qullasuyu (Conamaq). This body chooses an Apu Mallku as its head.

==Historical function and organization==
How the ancient and current organizational form correspond is unclear, since Spanish chronicles do not give a precise definition of the term.

Ayllu were self-sustaining social units that would educate their own children and farm or trade for all the food they ate, except in cases of disaster such as El Niño years when they relied on the Inca storehouse system.
Each ayllu owned a parcel of land, and the members had reciprocal obligations to each other.
The &quot;ayllu&quot; would often have their own &quot;wak&#x27;a&quot;, or minor god, usually embodied in a physical object such as a mountain or rock. &quot;Ayullus were named for a particular person or place.&quot;

In marriages, the woman would generally join the class and ayllu of her partner as would her children, but would inherit her land from her parents and retain her membership in her birth ayllu. This is how most movements of people between ayllu occurred. But a person could also join an ayllu by assuming the responsibility of membership. This included &quot;mink&#x27;a&quot;, communal work for common purposes, &quot;ayni&quot;, or work in kind for other members of the ayllu, and &quot;mit&#x27;a,&quot; a form of taxation levied by the Inca government and the Spanish Viceroyalties.

<doc id="478911" wikidata="Q383515" url="?curid=478911" title="Jerry L. Ross">
<text>Jerry Lynn Ross (born January 20, 1948, Crown Point, Indiana) is a retired United States Air Force officer, engineer, and a former NASA astronaut. Ross is a veteran of seven Space Shuttle missions, making him the joint record holder for most spaceflights (a record he shares with Franklin Chang-Díaz). 

His papers, photographs, and many personal items are in the Barron Hilton Flight and Space Exploration Archives at Purdue University. He was inducted into the Astronaut Hall of Fame during ceremonies in May 2014.

Ross is the author of &quot;Spacewalker: My Journey in Space and Faith as NASA&#x27;s Record-Setting Frequent Flyer&quot; (Purdue University Press, 2013) with John Norberg. In March 2014, it was announced &quot;Spacewalker&quot; would be available in a French translation through the specialist aerospace publisher, Altipresse.

Fellow astronaut, Chris Hadfield, describes Ross in his 2013 autobiography, &quot;An Astronaut&#x27;s Guide to Life on Earth&quot;, as &quot;the embodiment of the trustworthy, loyal, courteous and brave astronaut archetype.&quot;

==Education==
Ross graduated from Crown Point High School, Crown Point, Indiana, in 1966. He received a Bachelor of Science in 1970 and a Master of Science degree in 1972, both in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University. At Purdue, he joined the Purdue Reamer Club.

==Military career==
Ross, an Air Force ROTC student at Purdue University, received his commission upon graduation in 1970. After receiving his master&#x27;s degree from Purdue in 1972, he entered active duty with the Air Force and was assigned to the Ramjet Engine Division of Air Force Aero-Propulsion Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, in Ohio. He conducted computer-aided design studies on ramjet propulsion systems, served as the project engineer for captive tests of a supersonic ramjet missile using a rocket sled track, and as the project manager for preliminary configuration development of the ASALM strategic air-launched missile. 

From June 1974 to July 1975, he was the Laboratory Executive Officer and Chief of the Management Operations Office. Ross graduated from the USAF Test Pilot School’s Flight Test Engineer Course in 1976 and subsequently was assigned to the 6510th Test Wing at Edwards Air Force Base, California. While on assignment to the 6510th’s Flight Test Engineering Directorate, he was project engineer on a limited flying qualities evaluation of the RC-135S aircraft, and, as lead B-1 flying qualities flight test engineer, was responsible for the stability, control, and flight control system testing performance on the B-1 aircraft. As chief B-1 flight test engineer, he was also responsible for training and supervising all Air Force B-1 flight test engineer crew members and for performing the mission planning for the B-1 offensive avionics test aircraft.

Ross has flown in 21 different types of aircraft, holds a private pilot&#x27;s license, and has logged over 3,900 flying hours, the majority in military aircraft. He retired from the Air Force on March 31, 2000.

==NASA career==
In February 1979, Ross was assigned to the Payload Operations Division at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, as a payload officer/flight controller who was responsible for the flight operations integration of payloads into the Space Shuttle. Ross was selected as an astronaut in May 1980. His technical assignments since then have included EVA, or &quot;space walks&quot;, RMS (Remote Manipulator System, or &quot;robotic arm&quot;), and chase team; support crewman for STS 41-B, STS 41-C and STS 51-A; spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) during STS 41-B, STS 41-C, STS 41-D, STS 51-A and STS 51-D; Chief of the Mission Support Branch; member of the 1990 Astronaut Selection Board; Acting Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office, Chief of the Astronaut Office EVA and Robotics Branch, and Astronaut Office Branch Chief for Kennedy Space Center Operations Support. Ross was assigned to STS-62-A, the first Shuttle mission to launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base, but the mission was canceled after the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster.

Ross flew as a mission specialist on STS 61-B (1985), STS-27 (1988) and STS-37 (1991), was the Payload Commander on STS-55/Spacelab-D2 (1993), and again served as a mission specialist on the second Space Shuttle to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station Mir, STS-74 (1995), the first International Space Station assembly mission, STS-88 (1998) and STS-110 (2002). A veteran of 7 space flights, Ross has over 1,393 hours in space, including 57 hours and 55 minutes on 9 EVAs. (see below)

In addition to his record number of launches, among his many personal milestones, Ross held the U.S. record for spacewalks (9) until that was surpassed by the current record holder, ISS Expedition 14 commander Michael Lopez-Alegria (10 EVA&#x27;s totaling 67 hours and 40 minutes). However, there is speculation that on STS-27 (1988), Ross made an additional EVA. This shuttle mission was a classified DoD satellite launch and therefore information about the flight has never been released. Ross also holds the record for most flights on a single Space Shuttle orbiter (&quot;Atlantis&quot;) at five. 

In 2013 John Norberg, who worked with Ross on his book, filed a Freedom of Information Act concerning STS-27 with the National Reconnaissance Office. The NRO confirmed it had control of the records and declined to release any information about the flight. Ross has never commented on the objectives or his work on STS-27. Ross officially ranks third in the world for spacewalks behind Russian Anatoly Solovyev (16) and Lopez-Alegria.

Ross served as Chief of the Vehicle Integration Test Office at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas until he retired in January 2012.

Ross retired from NASA on January 28, 2012, after being the first person to launch into space 7 times. He also leaves NASA after placing third in the most spacewalks after completing 9 EVA&#x27;s.

==Spaceflight experience==
STS-61-B &quot;Atlantis&quot; was launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, on November 26, 1985. During the mission, the crew deployed the MORELOS-B, AUSSAT-2, and SATCOM Ku-2 communications satellites, and operated numerous other experiments. Ross conducted two 6-hour spacewalks to demonstrate Space Station construction techniques with the EASE/ACCESS experiments. After completing 108 orbits of the Earth in 165 hours, 4 minutes, 49 seconds, &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed on Runway 22 at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on December 3, 1985.

STS-27 &quot;Atlantis&quot;, was launched from KSC on December 2, 1988. The mission carried a Department of Defense payload, as well as a number of secondary payloads. After 68 orbits of the Earth in 105 hours, 6 minutes, 19 seconds, the mission concluded with a dry lakebed landing on Runway 17 at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on December 6, 1988. The mission is noteworthy due to the severe damage &quot;Atlantis&quot; sustained to its critical heat-resistant tiles during ascent.

STS-37 &quot;Atlantis&quot;, was launched from KSC on April 5, 1991, and deployed the 35,000 pound Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. Ross performed two spacewalks totaling 10 hours and 49 minutes to manually deploy the stuck Gamma Ray Observatory antenna and to test prototype Space Station Freedom hardware. After 93 orbits of the Earth in 143 hours, 32 minutes, 44 seconds, the mission concluded with a landing on Runway 33, at Edwards Air Force Base, on April 11, 1991.

STS-55 &quot;Columbia&quot;, was launched from KSC on April 26, 1993. With Ross serving as Payload Commander/Mission Specialist, nearly 90 experiments were conducted during the German-sponsored Spacelab D-2 mission to investigate life sciences, materials science, physics, robotics, astronomy, and the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. &quot;Columbia&quot; landed on May 6, 1993, at Edwards Air Force Base, after 160 orbits of the Earth in 239 hours and 45 minutes.

STS-74 &quot;Atlantis&quot;, launched from KSC on November 12, 1995, was NASA&#x27;s second Space Shuttle mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station Mir. During the eight-day flight, t the crew aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis attached a permanent docking module to Mir, conducted a number of secondary experiments, and transferred tons of supplies and experiment equipment between &quot;Atlantis&quot; and the Mir station. &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed at Kennedy Space Center on November 20 after accomplishing their achievements in 129 orbits of the Earth, traveling 3.4 million miles in 196 hours, 30 minutes, 44 seconds.

STS-88 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (December 4–15, 1998) was the first International Space Station assembly mission. During the 12-day mission, the U.S.-built &quot;Unity&quot; module was mated with the Russian &quot;Zarya&quot; module. Ross performed three spacewalks totaling 21 hours 22 minutes to connect umbilicals and attach tools/hardware. The crew also deployed two satellites, Mighty Sat 1 and SAC-A. The mission was accomplished in 185 orbits of the Earth in 283 hours and 18 minutes.

STS-110 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (April 8–19, 2002) was the 13th Shuttle mission to visit the International Space Station (ISS). The first mission in the final phase of the ISS Assembly included the delivery and installation of the S0 Truss; the first time the station&#x27;s robotic arm was used to maneuver space walkers around the station; it was also the first time that all of a shuttle crew&#x27;s spacewalks were based from the station&#x27;s, &quot;Quest&quot; Airlock. Ross performed 2 EVAs totaling 14 hours and 9 minutes. Mission duration was 259 hours and 42 minutes.

<text>Quintana Roo is a state in southeast Mexico established out of the Quintana Roo Territory in 1974 with seven municipalities, which has since grown into eleven municipalities. According to the 2020 Mexican census, it has the twenty-fourth largest population of all states with inhabitants and is the 19th largest by land area spanning .

Municipalities in Quintana Roo are administratively autonomous of the state according to the 115th article of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico. Their legal framework derives from the state Constitution. Every three years, citizens elect a municipal president (Spanish: &quot;presidente municipal&quot;) by a plurality voting system. The president heads a concurrently elected municipal council (&quot;ayuntamiento&quot;) responsible for providing public services for their constituents. The municipal council consists of trustees and councillors (&quot;regidores y síndicos&quot;). Municipalities are responsible for public services (such as water and sewerage), street lighting, public safety, traffic, and the maintenance of public parks, gardens and cemeteries. They may also assist the state and federal governments in education, emergency fire and medical services, environmental protection and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks. Since 1984, they have had the power to collect property taxes and user fees, although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than locally.

As of 2020, the largest municipality by population is Benito Juárez with 911,503 residents while the smallest is Isla Mujeres with 22,686 residents. The largest municipality by land area is Felipe Carrillo Puerto which spans , and the smallest is Cozumel with .
The newest municipality is Puerto Morelos which was created out of Benito Juárez in 2016.

<doc id="478917" wikidata="Q934889" url="?curid=478917" title="Operation Slapstick">
<text>Operation Slapstick was the code name for a British landing from the sea at the Italian port of Taranto during the Second World War. The operation, one of three landings during the Allied invasion of Italy in September 1943, was undertaken by airborne troops of the British 1st Airborne Division, commanded by Major-General George Hopkinson.

Planned at short notice, the mission followed an offer by the Italian government to open the ports of Taranto and Brindisi on the heel of Italy to the Allies. The airborne division was selected to undertake the mission, but at the time they were located in North Africa. A shortage of transport aircraft meant the division could not land in their traditional way by parachute and glider, and all the landing craft in the area were already allocated to the other landings: Operation Avalanche at Salerno on the western coast, and Operation Baytown at Calabria. Instead, the division had to be transported across the Mediterranean by ships of the Royal Navy. The landing was unopposed and the airborne division successfully captured the ports of Taranto, and later Brindisi on the Adriatic coast in working order.

The only German forces in the area were elements of the 1st Parachute Division (&quot;1. Fallschirmjäger Division&quot;), which engaged the advancing British in ambushes and at roadblocks during a fighting withdrawal north. Eventually, by the end of September, the British 1st Airborne Division advanced to Foggia. Reinforcements from two infantry divisions had by then been landed behind them, which allowed the airborne troops to be withdrawn to Taranto. Soon after, the division, minus the 2nd Parachute Brigade, sailed for England in preparation for Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy.

==Background==
In May 1943, the Axis powers of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy were defeated in the North African Campaign. Two months later, the Allied powers of Great Britain and the United States successfully launched their invasion of Sicily, codenamed Operation Husky. The island being completely occupied by the end of August, the Allies next turned their attention to the invasion of Italy.

On 3 September 1943, the British Eighth Army, under the command of General Sir Bernard Montgomery, crossed the Strait of Messina from Sicily and landed in Calabria during Operation Baytown to seize the ports of Reggio and San Giovanni. The main invasion was planned for 9 September, with the U.S. Fifth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Mark Clark, landing at Salerno on the western coast in Operation Avalanche, with Naples as their immediate objective. The Allies hoped that the invasion would persuade the Italian forces to surrender. If they did, the five Italian divisions in France and the twenty-nine in the Balkans would have to be replaced by German formations. Also, if the Germans then decided to continue the fight in Italy, they would have to redeploy some of their troops engaged on the Eastern Front or on occupation duties in France.

During secret surrender negotiations with the Allies in early September, the Italian government offered to open the ports of Taranto and Brindisi on the eastern coast. German forces in that area were very weak and would be expected to withdraw rather than fight if the Allies landed there. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean, quickly planned a third landing, codenamed Slapstick, to take advantage of the offer.

Slapstick was in part an operation of deception, to divert German forces away from the main Allied landings at Salerno on the same day, while also attempting to capture Taranto and Brindisi intact. The main value of Taranto was its large port. Its seizure would, with the expected capture of Naples in the west by the Americans, give the Allies supply points on both Italian coasts.

This military operation had a major political role, since the leaders of the government, including King Vittorio Emanuele III and his family, and Prime Minister Badoglio, fled from Rome to Brindisi after the surrender. Brindisi at the time was controlled only by the Italian Army, but its quick occupation by British troops secured the safety of the Italian leaders and allowed the declaration of war by Italy against Germany.

===Taranto===
Taranto is the capital city of the Province of Taranto in the region of Apulia and has a large harbor. It includes the two islets of St. Peter and St. Paul, which protect the bay, called the &quot;Mar Grande&quot; (&quot;Big Sea&quot;), where the commercial port is located. After the unification of Italy, Taranto became the main base of the Italian Navy.
The military port was located in another bay, the &quot;Mar Piccolo&quot;. In November 1940, the Royal Navy attacked the naval base in Taranto, sinking some Italian battleships.

==Prelude==
===German forces===
The German High Command fully expected Italy to surrender and, in preparation, had secretly established a new Army group headquarters commanded by &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Erwin Rommel at Munich. Rommel would have six divisions transferred from the Eastern Front, two divisions from France that had just been reformed, and two parachute divisions based in Germany in his new command. However, a Russian offensive in the east prevented the release of all the units promised. Adolf Hitler came to the conclusion that, without the backing of the Italian Army, it would be impossible for the Germans to defend the whole of Italy.

In Italy, German &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Albert Kesselring, unaware of what was happening in Germany, had been building up the strength of his forces. He was aided in this by the escape from Sicily of three divisions, which managed to cross the Strait of Messina without serious loss of men or equipment. In August, five infantry and two panzer divisions moved into northern Italy. After the loss of Sicily, Hitler amended the German plans, deciding to hold the Salerno-Naples area with five infantry divisions, while the 1st Parachute Division was ordered to the Apulia region.

Commanded by &quot;Generalmajor&quot; Richard Heidrich, the 1st Parachute Division consisted of the 1st, 3rd and 4th Parachute Regiments, with an artillery regiment, tank-destroyer, anti-aircraft, and engineer battalions, and other support units. The division was the successor of the original German airborne force, the 7th Air Division, and was highly experienced. It had spearheaded the German invasion in the west in 1940, and fought in the battles of Greece and Crete, and in the Soviet Union. Withdrawn from the Soviet Union in 1943, the division had already fought against British paratroops during operations in Sicily. However, on 9 September only three combat battalions and the headquarters were in Apulia.

===British forces===
Plans were formulated on 6 September to transport the British 1st Airborne Division to Taranto from their base in North Africa. They would take advantage of the Italian surrender to capture the port and establish anti-aircraft defences. What was left of the Italian fleet still using the harbour was expected to have left beforehand. The Allies believed that the division would face only minimal opposition and would be able to overcome any resistance with the limited naval support available, as Taranto was outside the range of Allied fighter aircraft based in Sicily.

Although it had been formed in October 1941, the British 1st Airborne Division, commanded by Major-General George Hopkinson, had never before fought as a complete division. The only units with any combat experience were the 1st Parachute Brigade, which had fought with distinction as an independent brigade in North Africa and in Operation Fustian during the Allied invasion of Sicily, and the 1st Airlanding Brigade, understrength with only two battalions, which had also fought in Sicily during Operation Ladbroke. Both brigades had suffered heavy casualties in Sicily and were in no condition to undertake any further assault landings. Of the division&#x27;s other brigades, the 2nd and 4th Para Brigades, were untried in battle. Also, the 2nd Parachute Brigade was the only full strength unit, as the 4th Parachute Brigade had only two battalions, with its third battalion still forming in Palestine.

There was only sufficient troop transport aircraft to support one division-sized operation, and that was allocated to the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, under Major General Matthew Ridgway, as part of the Salerno landings. As a result, the 1st Airborne Division had to be carried to Italy by sea. With no landing craft available on such short notice, the division was carried across the Mediterranean by four cruisers, , , and of the Royal Navy&#x27;s 12th Cruiser Squadron, accompanied by the minelayer and the American cruiser , all commanded by Commodore W.G. Agnew. If the landing was successful, the British 78th Infantry Division in Sicily and the 8th Indian Infantry Division in the Middle East, would be sent to reinforce the airborne division, under the command of V Corps.

==Landing==
Before leaving Tunisia, the 1st Airborne Division was divided into two-halves. The first half, consisting of the divisional headquarters, the 1st and 4th Parachute Brigade groups and the 9th Field Company, Royal Engineers, boarded the Royal Navy ships at Bizerta. The ships departed at 17:00 on 8 September, their decks loaded with the division&#x27;s vehicles and stores. Admiral of the Fleet Sir Andrew Cunningham was concerned that the Italian battle fleet based at Taranto might sortie and attack the cruisers which would be unable to defend themselves adequately, overloaded as they were with troops and equipment. He therefore ordered the battleships and and their six escorting destroyers, commanded by Vice Admiral Arthur Power, to leave their base in Malta and join the flotilla. At 18:30 8 September, while the convoy was at sea, General Dwight D. Eisenhower broadcast the details of the Italian surrender.

To support the British landings early on 9 September, Scanzano was attacked by American B-26 Marauders from the 17th and 310th Bombardment Groups. Then, just as the Allied flotilla approached Taranto, the Italian battleships and and three cruisers were observed leaving the harbour. The flotilla went to action stations, but the Italian ships just sailed past them en route to Malta to surrender in accordance with the agreement between the Allies and the Italian government. At 15:00, the flotilla reached the minefield guarding the entrance to Taranto. The destroyer negotiated the minefield and entered the harbour. Two hours later, &quot;Javelin&quot; returned with an Italian harbour pilot on board. HMS &quot;Penelope&quot; and USS &quot;Boise&quot; were guided safely into the harbour and alongside the jetty, where they disembarked the troops they were carrying, while the other ships in the flotilla remained outside the port and used small ship&#x27;s boats to take their soldiers ashore. The port&#x27;s facilities were all in working order and were soon unloading the ships.

The first units ashore were the headquarters of the 4th Parachute Brigade and the 10th Parachute Battalion, which were directed to move inland to guard against a German attack. When the airborne division troops entered the city, they were welcomed by the Italian garrison and informed that the German forces had already departed. When the two brigades were offloaded, they passed through the city and set up defensive positions to the north. At the same time, Major-General George F. Hopkinson established his divisional headquarters in the Albergo Europa Hotel and accepted the Italian surrender from the military governor.

After safely landing the first half of the division, the 12th Cruiser Squadron returned to Bizerta to collect the remaining troops, consisting of the 2nd Parachute Brigade, the 1st Airlanding Brigade and the Glider Pilot Regiment. The only casualties in the landing occurred on 10 September when HMS &quot;Abdiel&quot;, while manoeuvring alongside the dock, struck a mine and sank. Casualties totaled 58 killed and 154 wounded from the 6th (Royal Welch) Parachute Battalion, and 48 dead among &quot;Abdiel&quot;″s crew. &quot;Abdiel&quot; was also carrying twelve 6 pounder anti-tank guns of the 2nd Anti-tank Battery, and the division&#x27;s reserve ammunition supply.

Overnight, the 4th Parachute Brigade led the advance inland. By daybreak on 10 September, they had reached Massafra, where they were welcomed by the population. The next town they reached was Mottola, which was still occupied by the Germans. The Germans put up some resistance to the 156th Parachute Battalion&#x27;s assault, but withdrew soon after. The division&#x27;s first combat casualties resulted from this action. The wounded were evacuated to Taranto, where the 133rd (Parachute) Field Ambulance had established an 80-bed main dressing station at the Rendinella hospital.

The German paratroop rearguard tried to delay the British advance with several ambushes and roadblocks. At a roadblock beside the town of Castellaneta, Major-General Hopkinson, the 1st Airborne Division&#x27;s GOC, was hit by a burst of German machine gun fire while observing the 10th Parachute Battalion&#x27;s attack. He died of his wounds the following day. Hopkinson was replaced as the divisional commander by Brigadier Ernest Down, previously the commander of the 2nd Parachute Brigade.

Within 48 hours of landing at Taranto, the airborne division reached and occupied the port of Brindisi and Bari on the Adriatic coast without opposition since both cities were still under control of the Italian royal army. On 11 September on the division&#x27;s left, contact was made with the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, the leading unit of the British Eighth Army which had arrived in the area from Calabria. By the evening of 12 September, the 1st Airborne Division had advanced inland on foot.

The airborne division&#x27;s next objective was now the airfield at Gioia del Colle. The Royal Air Force needed the airfield to bring in fighter aircraft from Sicily and support the landings at Salerno, which had not gone as expected. The Germans continued their withdrawal, and Gioia was reached over the night of the 16/17 September, by the 10th and 156th Parachute battalions. The Royal Air Force took over the airfield and 48 hours later, six squadrons were flying from the base in support of Allied operations. Between 20 and 24 September, the 1st Airborne Division was ordered to halt and construct defences on the approaches to Taranto, due to concerns that the Germans might launch a counterattack against the overextended unit.

The V Corps headquarters landed at Taranto on 18 September and prepared for the arrival of its two divisions. The first was the British 78th Infantry Division, which started arriving at Bari on 22 September, followed by the 8th Indian Infantry Division at Taranto the next day. On 24 September, the 1st Parachute and 1st Airlanding brigades took over the advance for the airborne division. By 27 September, they and the 78th Division reached Foggia, from Taranto. From there, the airborne division was withdrawn to Taranto. By November, most of the 1st Airborne Division had left for England.

==Aftermath==
Operation Slapstick did not provide the diversion General Eisenhower had hoped for. The decision by Heidrich not to oppose the landings was made without reference to Kesselring&#x27;s headquarters. Heidrich had expected to be confronted by an overwhelming Allied force and had withdrawn his units north, although he endeavoured to delay the Allied advance where possible by ambushes and roadblocks. The German division went on to frustrate the Allied attempt to advance on Rome during the Battle of Monte Cassino in 1944.

<text>Tabasco is a state in Southeast Mexico that is divided into 17 municipalities. According to the 2020 Mexican census, it has the 20th largest population with inhabitants and is the 24th largest by land area spanning .

Municipalities in Tabasco are administratively autonomous of the state according to the 115th article of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico. Every three years, citizens elect a municipal president (Spanish: &quot;presidente municipal&quot;), by a plurality voting system, who heads a concurrently elected municipal council (&quot;ayuntamiento&quot;) which is responsible for providing all the public services for their constituents. The municipal council consists of a variable number of trustees and councillors (&quot;regidores y síndicos&quot;). Municipalities are responsible for public services (such as water and sewerage), street lighting, public safety, traffic, and the maintenance of public parks, gardens and cemeteries. They may also assist the state and federal governments in education, emergency fire and medical services, environmental protection and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks. Since 1984, they have had the power to collect property taxes and user fees, although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than from their own income.

The largest municipality by population is Centro, with 683,607 residents while the smallest is Jonuta with 30,798 residents. The largest municipality by land area is Huimanguillo which spans , and the smallest is Jalpa de Méndez with . Tabasco has kept the same number of municipalities since 1883, one of the few Mexican states without recent changes.

<text>Baron Kensington is a title that has been created three times, in the Peerages of England, Ireland and the United Kingdom.

==English title (1623)==

The first creation came in the Peerage of England in 1623 when the Honourable Henry Rich was made Baron Kensington. He was the younger son of Robert Rich, 1st Earl of Warwick (see Earl of Warwick for earlier history of the Rich family). Henry was made Earl of Holland in 1624. His son, the second Earl, succeeded as 5th Earl of Warwick on the death of his cousin in 1673. These titles all became extinct on the death of Edward Rich, 5th Baron Kensington, 5th Earl Holland and 8th Earl Warwick, in 1759 (see Earl of Warwick for a more detailed description of the descent of the titles). The barony was revived in 1776 for a female-line grandson of the fifth Earl of Warwick (see below).

==Irish title (1776)==

Lady Elizabeth Rich, only daughter of Robert Rich, 5th Earl of Warwick, married Francis Edwardes, Member of Parliament for Haverfordwest from 1722 to 1725, and the member of a family which owned extensive lands in Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire. Their son William Edwardes represented Haverfordwest in the House of Commons for over fifty years. He succeeded to the Rich family estates (including Holland House in Kensington, although this was sold to Henry Fox in 1768) on the death of the last of Earl of Warwick and Holland in 1759. In 1776 the barony of Kensington attached to the earldom of Holland was revived when he was made Baron Kensington in the Peerage of Ireland. The first Baron was succeeded by his son, William, the second Baron, who also represented Haverfordwest in Parliament. The second Baron&#x27;s son, William, the third Baron, served as Lord Lieutenant of Pembrokeshire. The third Baron was succeeded by his son, the fourth Baron.

==UK title (1886)==
William Edwardes, 4th Baron Kensington, sat as Liberal Member of Parliament for Haverfordwest from 1868 to 1885 and served as a government whip under William Ewart Gladstone from 1880 to 1885. In 1886, he was created Baron Kensington, of Kensington in the County of Middlesex, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave the holder an automatic seat in the House of Lords up until 1999. His eldest son, the fifth Baron of the Irish Peerage, who now also became the second Baron of the United Kingdom Peerage, served in the Second Boer War and died from wounds received in action in June 1900. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixth and third Baron. He was a Colonel in the Territorial Army and also fought in South Africa as well as in the First World War. the titles are held by his grandson, the eighth and fifth Baron, who succeeded his uncle in 1981.

<doc id="478921" wikidata="Q3107329" url="?curid=478921" title="The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (novel)">
<text>The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy is the first book in the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; comedy science fiction &quot;trilogy of five books&quot; by Douglas Adams with a sixth book written by Eoin Colfer. The novel is an adaptation of the first four parts of Adams&#x27;s radio series of the same name, centring on the adventures of the only man to survive the destruction of Earth. While roaming outer space, he comes to learn the truth behind Earth&#x27;s existence. The novel was first published in London on 12 October 1979. It sold 250,000 copies in the first three months.

The namesake of the novel is &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, a fictional guide book for hitchhikers (inspired by the &quot;Hitch-hiker&#x27;s Guide to Europe&quot;) written in the form of an encyclopaedia.

==Plot summary==

The novel opens with an introduction describing the human race as a primitive and deeply unhappy species, while also introducing an electronic encyclopedia called the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; which provides information on every planet in the galaxy. Earthman and Englishman Arthur Dent awakens in his home in the West Country to discover that the local planning council is trying to demolish his house to build a bypass, and lies down in front of the bulldozer to stop it. His friend Ford Prefect convinces the lead bureaucrat to lie down in Arthur&#x27;s stead so that he can take Arthur to the local pub. The construction crew begin demolishing the house anyway, but are interrupted by the sudden arrival of a fleet of spaceships. The Vogons, the callous race of civil servants running the fleet, announce that they have come to demolish Earth to make way for a hyperspace expressway, and promptly destroy the planet. Ford and Arthur survive by hitching a ride on the spaceship, much to Arthur&#x27;s amazement. Ford reveals to Arthur he is an alien researcher for the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse who has been posing as an out-of-work actor from Guildford for 15 years, and this was why they were able to hitch a ride on the alien ship. They are quickly discovered by the Vogons, who torture them by forcing them to listen to their poetry and then toss them out of an airlock.

Meanwhile, Zaphod Beeblebrox, Ford&#x27;s &quot;semi-cousin&quot; and the President of the Galaxy, steals the spaceship &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; at its unveiling with his human companion, Trillian. The &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; is equipped with an &quot;Infinite Improbability Drive&quot; that allows it to travel instantaneously to any point in space by simultaneously passing through every point in the universe at once. However, the Infinite Improbability Drive has a side effect of causing impossible coincidences to occur in the physical universe. One of these improbable events occurs when Arthur and Ford are rescued by the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; as it travels using the Infinite Improbability Drive. Zaphod takes his passengers — Arthur, Ford, a depressed robot named Marvin, and Trillian — to a legendary planet named Magrathea. Its inhabitants were said to have specialized in custom-building planets for others and to have vanished after becoming so rich that the rest of the galaxy became poor. Although Ford initially doubts that the planet is Magrathea, the planet&#x27;s computers send them warning messages to leave before firing two nuclear missiles at the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;. Arthur inadvertently saves them by activating the Infinite Improbability Drive improperly, which also opens an underground passage. As the ship lands, Trillian&#x27;s pet mice Frankie and Benjy escape.

On Magrathea, Zaphod, Ford, and Trillian venture down to the planet&#x27;s interior while leaving Arthur and Marvin outside. In the tunnels, Zaphod reveals that his actions are not a result of his own decisions, but instead motivated by neural programming that he was seemingly involved in but has no memory of. As Zaphod explains how he discovered this, the trio are trapped and knocked out with sleeping gas. On the surface, Arthur is met by a resident of Magrathea, a man named Slartibartfast, who explains that the Magratheans have been in stasis to wait out an economic recession. They have temporarily reawakened to reconstruct a second version of Earth commissioned by mice, who were in fact the most intelligent species on Earth. Slartibartfast brings Arthur to Magrathea&#x27;s planet construction facility, and shows Arthur that in the distant past, a race of &quot;hyperintelligent, pan-dimensional beings&quot; created a supercomputer named Deep Thought to determine the answer to the &quot;Ultimate Question to Life, the Universe, and Everything.&quot; Deep Thought eventually found the answer to be 42, an answer that made no sense because the Ultimate Question itself was not known. Because determining the Ultimate Question was too difficult even for Deep Thought, an even more advanced supercomputer was constructed for this purpose. This computer was the planet Earth, which was constructed by the Magratheans, and was five minutes away from finishing its task and figuring out the Ultimate Question when the Vogons destroyed it. The hyperintelligent superbeings participated in the program as mice, performing experiments on humans while pretending to be experimented on.

Slartibartfast takes Arthur to see his friends, who are at a feast hosted by Trillian&#x27;s pet mice. The mice reject as unnecessary the idea of building a new Earth to start the process over, deciding that Arthur&#x27;s brain likely contains the Ultimate Question. They offer to buy Arthur&#x27;s brain, leading to a fight when he declines. The group manages to escape when the planet&#x27;s security system goes off unexpectedly, but immediately run into the culprits: police in pursuit of Zaphod. The police corner Zaphod, Arthur, Ford and Trillian, and the situation seems desperate as they are trapped behind a computer bank that is about to explode from the officers&#x27; weapons firing. However, the police officers suddenly die when their life-support systems short-circuit. Suspicious, Ford discovers on the surface that Marvin became bored and explained his view of the universe to the police officers&#x27; spaceship, causing it to commit suicide. The five leave Magrathea and decide to go to The Restaurant at the End of the Universe.

==Illustrated edition==

&quot;The Illustrated Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; is a specially designed book made in 1994. It was first printed in the United Kingdom by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson and in the United States by Harmony Books (who sold it for $42.00). It is an oversized book, and came in silver-foil &quot;holographic&quot; covers in both the UK and US markets. It features the first appearance of the 42 Puzzle, designed by Adams himself, a photograph of Adams and his literary agent Ed Victor as the two space cops, and many other designs by Kevin Davies, who has participated in many Hitchhiker&#x27;s related projects since the stage productions in the late 1970s. Davies himself appears as Prosser. This edition is out of print – Adams bought up many remainder copies and sold them, autographed, on his website.

==In other media==
===Audiobook adaptations===
There have been three audiobook recordings of the novel. The first was an abridged edition (), recorded in the mid-1980s by Stephen Moore, best known for playing the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android in the radio series, LP adaptations and in the TV series. In 1990, Adams himself recorded an unabridged edition for Dove Audiobooks (), later re-released by New Millennium Audio () in the United States and available from BBC Audiobooks in the United Kingdom. Also by arrangement with Dove, ISIS Publishing Ltd produced a numbered exclusive edition signed by Douglas Adams () in 1994. To tie-in with the 2005 film, actor Stephen Fry, the film&#x27;s voice of the Guide, recorded a second unabridged edition ().

=== Television series ===
The popularity of the radio series gave rise to a six-episode television series, directed and produced by Alan J. W. Bell, which first aired on BBC 2 in January and February 1981. It employed many of the actors from the radio series and was based mainly on the radio versions of Fits the First through Sixth. A second series was planned at one point with a storyline, according to Alan Bell and Mark Wing-Davey, that would have come from Adams’s abandoned &quot;Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen&quot; project (instead of simply making a TV version of the second radio series). However, Adams got into disputes with the BBC (accounts differ: problems with budget, scripts and having Alan Bell involved are all offered as causes) and the second series was never made. Elements of &quot;Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen&quot; were instead used in the third novel, &quot;Life, the Universe and Everything&quot;.

The main cast was the same as the original radio series, except for David Dixon as Ford Prefect instead of McGivern and Sandra Dickinson as Trillian instead of Sheridan.

===Film adaptation===
&quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; was adapted into a science fiction comedy film directed by Garth Jennings and released on 28 April 2005 in the UK, Australia and New Zealand and on the following day in the United States and Canada. It was rolled out to cinemas worldwide during May, June, July, August and September.

==Reception==
Greg Costikyan reviewed &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #6 and commented that &quot;&quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot; is written with superb English wit, far more humorous than any American sitcom.&quot; &quot;The Pequod&quot; rated the book a 9.5 (out of 10.0) and called it &quot;an ingeniously silly sci-fi satire... It may not add up to much but the jokes keep coming fast and furiously and its enormous cultural influence (&quot;Don’t Panic,&quot; etc.) proves to be well-earned.&quot;

==Other books==
The deliberately misnamed &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; &quot;Trilogy&quot; consists of six books (a hexalogy). Although the series was called a trilogy by readers, the word &quot;trilogy&quot; does not appear on the cover of the first three books and was not used until the publication of the fourth one. The first five books of the series were written by Adams: 

* &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; (1979)
* &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot; (1980) 
* &quot;Life, the Universe and Everything&quot; (1982) 
* &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish&quot; (1984) 
* &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot; (1992) 

On 16 September 2008 it was announced that Irish author Eoin Colfer would continue the series with a sixth novel. This book, entitled &quot;And Another Thing...&quot;, was published in October 2009, on the 30th anniversary of the publication of the original novel.

==Legacy==
The &quot;Babel fish&quot;, a creature used in the novel that feeds on brainwaves and can instantly translate alien languages, inspired the name of Babel Fish, the first free online language translator, which launched in 1997.

Radiohead&#x27;s song &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; (1997) was named after Marvin&#x27;s nickname, and the album it appears on, &quot;OK Computer&quot;, is part of a line spoken by Zaphod to Eddie, the Heart of Gold&#x27;s computer.

The Trillian instant messaging app (2000–) was named after a character of the series.

Towel Day is celebrated every year on 25 May as a tribute to Douglas Adams by his fans. On this day, fans openly carry a towel with them to demonstrate their appreciation for Adams and the book series. The commemoration was first held 25 May 2001, two weeks after Adams&#x27; death on 11 May.

When Elon Musk&#x27;s Tesla Roadster was launched into space on the maiden flight of the Falcon Heavy rocket in February 2018, it had the words DON&#x27;T PANIC on the dashboard display and carried amongst other items a copy of the novel and a towel.

In 2022, the novel was included on the &quot;Big Jubilee Read&quot; list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors, selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

The novel&#x27;s popularity (or the entire &quot;Hitchhikers&quot; franchise) has contributed to many homages and references involving the number 42, ranging from numerous mentions in pop culture to frequent mentions of the novel whenever the number 42 is addressed in Western media.

<text>Yucatán is a state in southeastern Mexico that is divided into 106 municipalities, organized into 7 administrative regions. According to the 2020 Mexican census, it is the twenty-second most populated state with inhabitants and the 20th largest by land area spanning .

Municipalities in Yucatán are administratively autonomous of the state according to the 115th article of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico. Every three years, citizens elect a municipal president (Spanish: &quot;presidente municipal&quot;) by a plurality voting system who heads a concurrently elected municipal council (&quot;ayuntamiento&quot;) responsible for providing all the public services for their constituents. The municipal council consists of a variable number of trustees and councillors (&quot;regidores y síndicos&quot;). Municipalities are responsible for public services (such as water and sewerage), street lighting, public safety, traffic, and the maintenance of public parks, gardens and cemeteries. They may also assist the state and federal governments in education, emergency fire and medical services, environmental protection and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks. Since 1984, they have had the power to collect property taxes and user fees, although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than from their own income.

The largest municipality by population is Mérida, with 995,129 residents (42.87% of the state&#x27;s total), while the smallest is Quintana Roo with 976 residents. The largest municipality by land area is Tizimín which spans , and the smallest is Sanahcat with . The newest municipality is Chikindzonot, established in 1957.

Kavandi was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in December 1994 and reported to the Johnson Space Center in March 1995. Following an initial year of training, she was assigned to the Payloads and Habitability Branch, where she supported payload integration for the International Space Station. Kavandi served as a mission specialist on STS-91 (June 2–12, 1998), the 9th and final Shuttle-Mir docking mission, concluding the joint U.S./Russian Phase 1 program. Following the mission, she worked as a CAPCOM (spacecraft communicator) in NASA&#x27;s Mission Control Center. On her second mission, she served aboard STS-99 (February 11–22, 2000), the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, which mapped more than 47 million miles of the Earth&#x27;s land surface to provide data for a highly accurate three-dimensional topographical map.

Kavandi subsequently worked in the Robotics Branch, where she trained on both the shuttle and space station robotic manipulator systems. On her most recent mission, she served aboard STS-104/ISS Assembly Flight 7A (July 12–24, 2001) on the tenth mission to the International Space Station. The shuttle crew installed the joint airlock &quot;Quest&quot; and conducted joint operations with the Expedition 2 crew. Kavandi had trained in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory for spacewalking, but she did not take a spacewalk during STS-104.

Following her last mission, Kavandi again served as lead for the Payloads and Habitability Branch, then as the branch chief for the International Space Station (ISS). She was responsible for the training, operations, safety, and habitability of crews on board the ISS, as well as the hardware and software development and design reviews. She was also responsible for the scientific payloads that the ISS crews operate on-orbit and for coordination between international partners for visiting vehicles and associated operations. In 2005, Kavandi accepted a position as deputy chief of the Astronaut Office and served in that position until February 2008. Following that assignment, she became deputy director, flight crew operations, and then director, flight crew operations Johnson Space Center.

A three-flight veteran, Kavandi has logged over 33 days in space, traveling over 13.1 million miles in 535 Earth orbits.

In March 2016, Kavandi succeeded Jim Free as the center director at the NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio.

In September 2019, she retired from NASA and started at Sierra Nevada Corporation.

<doc id="478931" wikidata="Q4862542" url="?curid=478931" title="Baron Kilmaine">
<text>Baron Kilmaine is a title that has been created twice, both times in the Peerage of Ireland. The first creation came in 1722 in favour of the soldier the Hon. James O&#x27;Hara. Two years later he succeeded his father as Baron Tyrawley. However, both titles became extinct on the second Baron Tyrawley&#x27;s death in 1773 without legitimate sons.

The second creation came in 1789 when Sir John Browne, 7th Baronet, of The Neale, was created Baron Kilmaine, of The Neale in the County of Mayo. He had previously represented Newtownards and Carlow in the Irish House of Commons. His grandson, the third Baron, sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1849 to 1873. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Baron. He was an Irish Representative Peer from 1890 to 1907, when he killed himself by jumping out of the window of a hotel in Paris. His son, the fifth Baron, sat as an Irish Representative Peer from 1911 to 1946, when he also died by suicide by drinking poison.

The seventh Baron lived in the West Midlands, was a founder of Whale Tankers Ltd, of Ravenshaw, Solihull. His widow, Linda (Lady Kilmaine), is a former High Sheriff of Warwickshire. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s only son, John, the eighth Baron, who succeeded his father in 2013. He lives in a Camphill community in South Wales. The seventh Baron served as a Trustee of his son&#x27;s care home and left a legacy in his will to commission to a state of the art accommodation block to house five individuals with learning disabilities.
The Browne baronetcy, of The Neale in the County of Mayo, was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia in 1636 for John Browne. However, he never assumed the title. The baronetcy was actually only assumed for the first time by his great-great-grandson, the sixth Baronet. The latter was succeeded by his younger brother, the seventh Baronet, who was created Baron Kilmaine in 1789.

Two other members of the Browne family have been elevated to the peerage. John Browne, 1st Earl of Altamont (the grandfather of John Browne, 1st Marquess of Sligo), was the grandson of Colonel John Browne, younger son of Sir John Browne, 1st Baronet. Consequently, the present Marquess of Sligo is also in remainder to the Browne baronetcy, of The Neale. Furthermore, Augusta Browne, youngest daughter of the Very Reverend the Hon. Henry Montague Browne, second son of the second Baron Kilmaine, was created Baroness Bolsover in 1880.

This Browne family of Ireland bears the arms &quot;Sable, three lions passant in bend argent between four bendlets argent&quot; which are the same arms as borne by the English family of Browne, Viscount Montagu, descended from Sir (c.1500-1548), KG, of Battle Abbey and Cowdray Park, Master of the Horse to King Henry VIII. However no familial connection between the two families is mentioned in The Complete Peerage (1910).

As of 2025, the present holder of the barony has not successfully proven his succession to the baronetcy and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the baronetcy considered vacant. However, at least as of 2013, the family remained in possession of Shelfield House, Warwickshire.

<doc id="478933" wikidata="Q380170" url="?curid=478933" title="Energy conservation">
<text>Energy conservation is the effort to reduce wasteful energy consumption by using fewer energy services. This can be done by using energy more effectively (using less and better sources of energy for continuous service) or changing one&#x27;s behavior to use less and better source of service (for example, by driving vehicles which consume renewable energy or energy with more efficiency). Energy conservation can be achieved through efficient energy use, which has some advantages, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a smaller carbon footprint, as well as cost, water, and energy savings.

Green engineering practices improve the life cycle of the components of machines which convert energy from one form into another.

Energy can be conserved by reducing waste and losses, improving efficiency through technological upgrades, improving operations and maintenance, changing users&#x27; behaviors through user profiling or user activities, monitoring appliances, shifting load to off-peak hours, and providing energy-saving recommendations. Observing appliance usage, establishing an energy usage profile, and revealing energy consumption patterns in circumstances where energy is used poorly, can pinpoint user habits and behaviors in energy consumption. Appliance energy profiling helps identify inefficient appliances with high energy consumption and energy load. Seasonal variations also greatly influence energy load, as more air-conditioning is used in warmer seasons and heating in colder seasons. Achieving a balance between energy load and user comfort is complex yet essential for energy preservation. On a large scale, a few factors affect energy consumption trends, including political issues, technological developments, economic growth, and environmental concerns.

== User-oriented energy conservation ==
User behavior has a significant effect on energy conservation. It involves user activity detection, profiling, and appliance interaction behaviors. User profiling consists of the identification of energy usage patterns of the user and replacing required system settings with automated settings that can be initiated on request. Within user profiling, personal characteristics are instrumental in affecting energy conservation behavior. These characteristics include household income, education, gender, age, and social norms.

User behavior also relies on the impact of personality traits, social norms, and attitudes on energy conservation behavior. Beliefs and attitudes toward a convenient lifestyle, environmentally friendly transport, energy security, and residential location choices affect energy conservation behavior. As a result, energy conservation can be made possible by adopting pro-environmental behavior and energy-efficient systems. Education on approaches to energy conservation can result in wise energy use. The choices made by the users yield energy usage patterns. Rigorous analysis of these usage patterns identifies waste energy patterns, and improving those patterns may reduce significant energy load. Therefore, human behavior is critical to determining the implications of energy conservation measures and solving environmental problems. Substantial energy conservation may be achieved if users&#x27; habit loops are modified.

== User habits ==
User habits significantly impact energy demand; thus, providing recommendations for improving user habits contributes to energy conservation. Micro-moments are essential in realizing energy consumption patterns and are identified using a variety of sensing units positioned in prominent areas across the home. The micro-moment is an event that changes the state of the appliance from inactive to active and helps in building users&#x27; energy consumption profiles according to their activities. Energy conservation can be achieved through user habits by following energy-saving recommendations at micro-moments. Unnecessary energy usage can be decreased by selecting a suitable schedule for appliance operation. Creating an effective scheduling system requires an understanding of user habits regarding appliances.

== Off-peak scheduling ==
Many techniques for energy conservation comprise off-peak scheduling, which means operating an appliance in a low-price energy hour. This schedule can be achieved after user habits regarding appliance use are understood. Most energy providers divide the energy tariff into high and low-price hours; therefore, scheduling an appliance to work an off-peak hour will significantly reduce electricity bills.

== User activity detection ==
User activity detection leads to the precise detection of appliances required for an activity. If an appliance is active but not required for a user&#x27;s current activity, it wastes energy and can be turned off to conserve energy. The precise identification of user activities is necessary to achieve this method of energy conservation.

==Energy conservation opportunities by sector==

=== Buildings ===

==== Existing buildings ====
Energy conservation measures have primarily focused on technological innovations to improve efficiencies and financial incentives with theoretical explanations obtained from the mentioned analytical traditions. Existing buildings can improve energy efficiency by changing structural maintenance materials, adjusting the composition of air conditioning systems, selecting energy-saving equipment, and formulating subsidy policies. These measures can improve users&#x27; thermal comfort and reduce buildings&#x27; environmental impact. The selection of combinatorial optimization schemes that contain measures to guide and restrict users&#x27; behavior in addition to carrying out demand-side management can dynamically adjust energy consumption. At the same time, economic means should enable users to change their behavior and achieve a low-carbon life. Combination optimization and pricing incentives reduce building energy consumption and carbon emissions and reduce users&#x27; costs.

Energy monitoring through energy audits can achieve energy efficiency in existing buildings. An energy audit is an inspection and analysis of energy use and flows for energy conservation in a structure, process, or system intending to reduce energy input without negatively affecting output. Energy audits can determine specific opportunities for energy conservation and efficiency measures as well as determine cost-effective strategies. Training professionals typically accomplish this and can be part of some national programs discussed above. The recent development of smartphone apps enables homeowners to complete relatively sophisticated energy audits themselves. For instance, smart thermostats can connect to standard HVAC systems to maintain energy-efficient indoor temperatures. In addition, data loggers can also be installed to monitor the interior temperature and humidity levels to provide a more precise understanding of the conditions. If the data gathered is compared with the users&#x27; perceptions of comfort, more fine-tuning of the interiors can be implemented (e.g., increasing the temperature where A.C. is used to prevent over-cooling). Building technologies and smart meters can allow commercial and residential energy users to visualize the impact their energy use can have in their workplaces or homes. Advanced real-time energy metering can help people save energy through their actions.

Another approach towards energy conservation is the implementation of ECMs in commercial buildings, which often employ Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) experienced in energy performance contracting. This industry has been around since the 1970s and is more prevalent than ever today. The US-based organization EVO (Efficiency Valuation Organization) has created a set of guidelines for ESCOs to adhere to in evaluating the savings achieved by ECMs. These guidelines are called the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP).

Energy efficiency can also be achieved by upgrading certain aspects of existing buildings. Making thermal improvements by adding insulation to crawl spaces and ensuring no leaks achieves an efficient building envelope, reducing the need for mechanical systems to heat and cool the space. High-performance insulation is also supported by adding double/triple-glazed windows to minimize thermal heat transmission. Minor upgrades in existing buildings include changing mixers to low flow greatly aids in water conservation, changing light bulbs to LED lights results in 70-90% less energy consumption than a standard incandescent or C.F.L. bulb, changing inefficient appliances with Energy Star-rated appliances will consume less energy, and finally adding vegetation in the landscape surrounding the building to function as a shading element. A window windcatcher can reduce the total energy use of a building by 23.3%.

Energy conservation through users&#x27; behaviors requires understanding household occupants&#x27; lifestyle, social, and behavioral factors in analyzing energy consumption. This involves one-time investments in energy efficiency, such as purchasing new energy-efficient appliances or upgrading the building insulation without curtailing economic utility or the level of energy services, and energy curtailment behaviors which are theorized to be driven more by social-psychological factors and environmental concerns in comparison to the energy efficiency behaviors. Replacing existing appliances with newer and more efficient ones leads to energy efficiency as less energy is wasted throughout. Overall, energy efficiency behaviors are identified more with one-time, cost-incurring investments in efficient appliances and retrofits, while energy curtailment behaviors include repetitive, low-cost energy-saving efforts.

To identify and optimize residential energy use, conventional and behavioral economics, technology adoption theory and attitude-based decision-making, social and environmental psychology, and sociology must be analyzed. The techno-economic and psychological literature analysis focuses on the individual attitude, behavior, and choice/context/external conditions. In contrast, the sociological literature relies more on the energy consumption practices shaped by the social, cultural, and economic factors in a dynamic setting.

==== New buildings ====
Many steps can be taken toward energy conservation and efficiency when designing new buildings. Firstly, the building can be designed to optimize building performance by having an efficient building envelope with high-performing insulation and window glazing systems, window facades strategically oriented to optimize daylighting, shading elements to mitigate unwanted glare, and passive energy systems for appliances. In passive solar building designs, windows, walls, and floors are made to collect, store, and distribute solar energy in the form of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer.

The key to designing a passive solar building is to best take advantage of the local climate. Elements to be considered include window placement and glazing type, thermal insulation, thermal mass, and shading. Optimizing daylighting can decrease energy waste from incandescent bulbs, windows, and balconies, allow natural ventilation, reduce the need for heating and cooling, low flow mixers aid in water conservation, and upgrade to Energy star rated appliances consume less energy. Designing a building according to LEED guidelines while incorporating smart home technology can help save a lot of energy and money in the long run. Passive solar design techniques can be applied most easily to new buildings, but existing buildings can be retrofitted.

Mainly, energy conservation is achieved by modifying user habits or providing an energy-saving recommendation of curtailing an appliance or scheduling it to low-price energy tariff hours. Besides changing user habits and appliance control, identifying irrelevant appliances concerning user activities in smart homes saves energy. Smart home technology can advise users on energy-saving strategies according to their behavior, encouraging behavioral change that leads to energy conservation. This guidance includes reminders to turn off lights, leakage sensors to prevent plumbing issues, running appliances on off-peak hours, and smart sensors that save energy. Such technology learns user-appliance activity patterns, gives a complete overview of various energy-consuming appliances, and can provide guidance to improve these patterns to contribute to energy conservation. As a result, they can strategically schedule appliances by monitoring the energy consumption profiles of the appliances, schedule devices to the energy-efficient mode, or plan to work during off-peak hours.

Appliance-oriented approaches emphasize appliance profiling, curtailing, and scheduling to off-peak hours, as supervision of appliances is key to energy preservation. It usually leads to appliance curtailment in which an appliance is either scheduled to work another time or is turned off. Appliance curtailment involves appliance recognition, activity-appliances model, unattended appliance detection, and energy conservation service. The appliance recognition module detects active appliances to identify the activities of smart home users. After identifying users&#x27; activities, the association between the functional appliances and user activities is established. The unattended appliance detection module looks for active appliances but is unrelated to user activity. These functional appliances waste energy and can be turned off by providing recommendations to the user.

Based on the smart home recommendations, users can give weight to certain appliances that increase user comfort and satisfaction while conserving energy. Energy consumption models of energy consumption of appliances and the level of comfort they create can balance priorities among smart home comfort levels and energy consumption. According to Kashimoto, Ogura, Yamamoto, Yasumoto, and Ito, the energy supply reduces based on the historical state of the appliance and increases according to the comfort level requirement of the user, leading to a targeted energy-saving ratio. Scenarios-based energy consumption can be employed as a strategy for energy conservation, with each scenario encompassing a specific set of rules for energy consumption.

===Transportation===
Transporting people, goods, and services represented 29% of U.S. energy consumption in 2007. The transportation sector also accounted for about 33% of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions in 2006, with highway vehicles accounting for about 84% of that, making transportation an essential target for addressing global climate change (E.I.A., 2008). Suburban infrastructure evolved during an age of relatively easy access to fossil fuels, leading to transportation-dependent living systems.[] The amount of energy used to transport people to and from a facility, whether they are commuters, customers, vendors, or homeowners, is known as the transportation energy intensity of the building. Land is developing at a faster rate than population growth, leading to urban sprawl and, therefore, high transportation energy intensity as more people need to commute longer distances to jobs. As a result, the location of a building is essential in decreasing embodied emissions.

In transportation, state and local efforts in energy conservation and efficiency measures tend to be more targeted and smaller in scale. However, with more robust fuel economy standards, new targets for the use of alternative transportation fuels, and new efforts in electric and hybrid electric vehicles, EPAct05 and EISA provide a new set of national policy signals and financial incentives to the private sector and state and local governments for the transportation sector. Zoning reforms that allow greater urban density and designs for walking and bicycling can greatly reduce energy consumed for transportation. Many Americans work in jobs that allow for remote work instead of commuting daily, which is a significant opportunity to conserve energy.[] Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) provide a solution to traffic congestion and C.E.s caused by increased vehicles. ITS combines improvements in information technology and systems, communications, sensors, controllers, and advanced mathematical methods with the traditional world of transportation infrastructure. It improves traffic safety and mobility, reduces environmental impact, promotes sustainable transportation, and increases productivity. The ITS strengthens the connection and cooperation between people, vehicles, roads, and the environment while improving road capacity, reducing traffic accidents, and improving transportation efficiency and safety by alleviating traffic congestion and reducing pollution. It makes full use of traffic information as an application service, which can enhance the operational efficiency of existing traffic facilities.

The most significant energy-saving potential is that there are the most problems in urban transportation in various countries, such as management systems, policies and regulations, planning, technology, operation, and management mechanism. Improvements in one or several aspects will improve road transportation. Efficiency has a positive impact, which leads to the improvement of the urban traffic environment and efficiency.

In addition to ITS, transit-oriented development (T.O.D.) significantly improves transportation in urban areas by emphasizing density, proximity to transit, diversity of uses, and streetscape design. Density is important for optimizing location and is a way to cut down on driving. Planners can regulate development rights by exchanging them from ecologically sensitive areas to growth-friendly zones according to density transfer procedures. Distance is defined as the accessibility of rail and bus transits, which serve as deterrents for driving. For transit-oriented development to be feasible, transportation stops must be close to where people live. Diversity refers to mixed-use areas that offer essential services close to homes and offices and include residential spaces for different socioeconomic categories, commercial and retail. This creates a pedestrian shed where one area can meet people&#x27;s everyday needs on foot. Lastly, the streetscapes design involves minimal parking and walkable areas that calm traffic. Generous parking incentivizes people to use cars, whereas minimal and expensive parking deters commuters. At the same time, streetscapes can be designed to incorporate bicycling lanes and designated bicycle paths and trails. People may commute by bicycle to work without being concerned about their bicycles becoming wet because of covered bicycle storage. This encourages commuters to use bicycles rather than other modes of transportation and contributes to energy saving. People will be happy to walk a few blocks from a train stop if there are attractive, pedestrian-friendly outdoor spaces nearby with good lighting, park benches, outdoor tables at cafés, shade tree plantings, pedestrian courts that are blocked off to cars, and public internet connection. Additionally, this strategy calms traffic, improving the intended pedestrian environment.

New urban planning schemes can be designed to improve connectivity in cities through networks of interconnected streets that spread out traffic flow, slow down vehicles, and make walking more pleasant. By dividing the number of road links by the number of road nodes, the connectivity index is calculated. The higher the connectivity index, the greater the route choices and the better the pedestrian access. Realizing the transportation impacts associated with buildings allows commuters to take steps toward energy conservation. Connectivity encourages energy-conserving behaviors as commuters use fewer cars, walk and bike more, and use public transportation. For commuters who do not have the option of public transportation, smaller vehicles that are hybrid or have better mileage can be used.

===Consumer products===
Homeowners implementing ECMs in their residential buildings often start with an energy audit. This is a way homeowners look at what areas of their homes are using, and possibly losing energy. Residential energy auditors are accredited by the Building Performance Institute (BPI) or the Residential Energy Services Network (RESNET). Homeowners can hire a professional or do it themselves or use a smartphone to help do an audit.

Energy conservation measures are often combined into larger guaranteed Energy Savings Performance Contracts to maximize energy savings while minimizing disruption to building occupants by coordinating renovations. Some ECMs cost less to implement yet return higher energy savings. Traditionally, lighting projects were a good example of &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; that could be used to drive implementation of more substantial upgrades to HVAC systems in large facilities. Smaller buildings might combine window replacement with modern insulation using advanced building foams to improve energy for performance. Energy dashboard projects are a new kind of ECM that relies on the behavioral change of building occupants to save energy. When implemented as part of a program, case studies, such as that for the DC Schools, report energy savings up 30%. Under the right circumstances, open energy dashboards can even be implemented for free to improve upon these savings even more.

Consumers are often poorly informed of the savings of energy-efficient products. A prominent example of this is the energy savings that can be made by replacing an incandescent light bulb with a more modern alternative. When purchasing light bulbs, many consumers opt for cheap incandescent bulbs, failing to take into account their higher energy costs and lower lifespans when compared to modern compact fluorescent and LED bulbs. Although these energy-efficient alternatives have a higher upfront cost, their long lifespan and low energy use can save consumers a considerable amount of money. The price of LED bulbs has also been steadily decreasing in the past five years due to improvements in semiconductor technology. Many LED bulbs on the market qualify for utility rebates that further reduce the price of the purchase to the consumer. Estimates by the U.S. Department of Energy state that widespread adoption of LED lighting over the next 20 years could result in about $265 billion worth of savings in United States energy costs.

The research one must put into conserving energy is often too time-consuming and costly for the average consumer when there are cheaper products and technology available using today&#x27;s fossil fuels. Some governments and NGOs are attempting to reduce this complexity with Eco-labels that make differences in energy efficiency easy to research while shopping.

To provide the kind of information and support people need to invest money, time and effort in energy conservation, it is important to understand and link to people&#x27;s topical concerns. For instance, some retailers argue that bright lighting stimulates purchasing. However, health studies have demonstrated that headache, stress, blood pressure, fatigue and worker error all generally increase with the common over-illumination present in many workplace and retail settings. It has been shown that natural daylighting increases productivity levels of workers, while reducing energy consumption.

In warm climates where air conditioning is used, any household device that gives off heat will result in a larger load on the cooling system. Items such as stoves, dishwashers, clothes dryers, hot water, and incandescent lighting all add heat to the home. Low-power or insulated versions of these devices give off less heat for the air conditioning to remove. The air conditioning system can also improve efficiency by using a heat sink that is cooler than the standard air heat exchanger, such as geothermal or water.

In cold climates, heating air and water is a major demand for household energy use. Significant energy reductions are possible by using different technologies. Heat pumps are a more efficient alternative to electrical resistance heaters for warming air or water. A variety of efficient clothes dryers are available, and the clothes lines requires no energy- only time. Natural-gas (or bio-gas) condensing boilers and hot-air furnaces increase efficiency over standard hot-flue models. Standard electric boilers can be made to run only at hours of the day when they are needed by means of a time switch. This decreases energy use vastly. In showers, a semi-closed-loop system could be used. New construction implementing heat exchangers can capture heat from wastewater or exhaust air in bathrooms, laundry, and kitchens.

In both warm and cold climate extremes, airtight thermal insulated construction is the largest factor determining the efficiency of a home. Insulation is added to minimize the flow of heat to or from the home, but can be labor-intensive to retrofit to an existing home.

==Energy conservation by countries==

===Asia===
Although energy efficiency is expected to play a vital role in cost-effectively cutting energy demand, only a small part of its economic potential is exploited in Asia. Governments have implemented a range of subsidies such as cash grants, cheap credit, tax exemptions, and co-financing with public-sector funds to encourage energy-efficiency initiatives across several sectors. Governments in the Asia-Pacific region have implemented a range of information provision and labeling programs for buildings, appliances, and the transportation and induel-economy labels, or actively seek to encourage behavioral changes, such as Japan&#x27;s Cool Biz campaign that encourages setting air conditioners at 28-degrees Celsius and allowing employees to dress casually in the summer.

China&#x27;s government has launched a series of policies since 2005 to effectively promote the goal of reducing energy-saving emissions; however, road transportation, the fastest-growing energy-consuming sector in the transportation industry, lacks specific, operational, and systematic energy-saving plans. Road transportation is the highest priority to achieve energy conservation effectively and reduce emissions, particularly since social and economic development has entered the &quot;new norm&quot; period. Generally speaking, the government should make comprehensive plans for conservation and emissions reduction in the road transportation industry within the three dimensions of demand, structure, and technology. For example, encouraging trips using public transportation and new transportation modes such as car-sharing and increasing investment in new energy vehicles in structure reform, etc.

===European Union===
At the end of 2006, the European Union (EU) pledged to cut its annual consumption of primary energy by 20% by 2020. The EU Energy Efficiency Directive 2012 mandates energy efficiency improvements within the EU.

As part of the EU&#x27;s SAVE program, aimed at promoting energy efficiency and encouraging energy-saving behavior, the Boiler Efficiency Directive specifies minimum levels of efficiency for boilers using liquid or gaseous fuels.

There is steady progress on energy regulation implementation in Europe, North America, and Asia, with the highest number of building energy standards being adopted and implemented. Moreover, the performance of Europe is highly encouraging concerning energy standard activities. They recorded the highest percentage of mandatory energy standards compared to the other five regions.

In 2050, energy savings in Europe can reach 67% of the 2019 baseline scenario, amounting to a demand of 361 Mtoe in an &quot;energy efficiency first&quot; societal trend scenario. A condition is that there be no rebound effect, for otherwise the savings are 32% only or energy use may even increase by 42% if techno-economic potentials are not realized.

Germany has reduced its primary energy consumption by 11% from 1990 to 2015 and set itself goals of reducing it by 30% by the year 2030 and by 50% by the year 2050 in comparison to the level of 2008.

===India===

The Petroleum Conservation Research Association (PCRA) is an Indian governmental body created in 1978 that engages in promoting energy efficiency and conservation in every walk of life. In the recent past, PCRA has organised mass media campaigns in television, radio, and print media. This is an impact-assessment survey by a third party that revealed that due to these larger campaigns by PCRA, the public&#x27;s overall awareness level has gone up leading to the saving of fossil fuels worth crores of rupees, besides reducing pollution.

The Bureau of Energy Efficiency is an Indian government organization created in 2001 that is responsible for promoting energy efficiency and conservation.

Protection and Conservation of Natural Resources are done by Community Natural Resources Management (CNRM).

===Iran===
Supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei had regularly criticized energy administration and high fuel consumption.

===Japan===
Since the 1973 oil crisis, energy conservation has been an issue in Japan. All oil-based fuel is imported, so domestic sustainable energy is being developed.

The Energy Conservation Center promotes energy efficiency in every aspect of Japan. Public entities are implementing the efficient use of energy for industries and research. It includes projects such as the Top Runner Program. In this project, new appliances are regularly tested on efficiency, and the most efficient ones are made the standard.

=== Middle East ===
The Middle East holds 40% of the world&#x27;s crude oil reserves and 23% of its natural gas reserves. Conservation of domestic fossil fuels is, therefore, a legitimate priority for the Gulf countries, given domestic needs as well as the global market for these products. Energy subsidies are the chief barrier to conservation in the Gulf. Residential electricity prices can be a tenth of U.S. rates. As a result, increased tariff revenues from gas, electricity, and water sales would encourage investment in natural gas exploration and production and generation capacity, helping to alleviate future shortages.

Households in the MENA region are responsible for 53% of energy use in Saudi Arabia and 57% of the UAE&#x27;s ecological footprint. This is partially due to poorly designed and constructed buildings, mainly under a cheap energy model that has left them without contemporary control technology or even proper insulation and efficient appliances. Building energy consumption can be cut by 20% under a combination of insulation, efficient windows and appliances, shading, reflective roofing, and a host of automated controls that adjust energy use.

Governments could also set minimum energy efficiency and water use standards on importing appliances sold inside their countries, effectively banning the sale of inefficient air conditioners, dishwashers, and washing machines. Administration of the laws would essentially be a function of national customs services. Governments could go further, offering incentives – or mandates – that air conditioners of a certain age be replaced.

==== Lebanon ====
In Lebanon and since 2002 The Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation (LCEC) has been promoting the development of efficient and rational uses of energy and the use of renewable energy at the consumer level. It was created as a project financed by the International Environment Facility (GEF) and the Ministry of Energy Water (MEW) under the management of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and gradually established itself as an independent technical national center although it continues to be supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as indicated in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between MEW and UNDP on 18 June 2007.

===Nepal===
Until recently, Nepal has been focusing on the exploitation of its huge water resources to produce hydropower. Demand-side management and energy conservation were not in the focus of government action. In 2009, bilateral Development Cooperation between Nepal and the Federal Republic of Germany has agreed upon the joint implementation of the &quot;Nepal Energy Efficiency Programme&quot;. The lead executing agencies for the implementation are the Water and Energy Commission Secretariat (WECS). The aim of the program is the promotion of energy efficiency in policymaking, in rural and urban households as well as in the industry.

Due to the lack of a government organization that promotes energy efficiency in the country, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) has established the Energy Efficiency Centre under his roof to promote energy conservation in the private sector. The Energy Efficiency Centre is a non-profit initiative that is offering energy auditing services to the industries. The centre is also supported by Nepal Energy Efficiency Programme of Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit.

A study conducted in 2012 found out that Nepalese industries could save 160,000-megawatt hours of electricity and 8,000 terajoules of thermal energy (like diesel, furnace oil, and coal) every year. These savings are equivalent to annual energy cost cut of up to 6.4 Billion Nepalese Rupees.
As a result of Nepal Economic Forum 2014, an economic reform agenda in the priority sectors was declared focusing on energy conservation among others. In the energy reform agenda, the government of Nepal gave the commitment to introduce incentive packages in the budget of the fiscal year 2015/16 for industries that practices energy efficiency or use efficient technologies (incl. cogeneration).

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority is the Government Agency responsible for promoting energy efficiency and conservation. The Energy Management Association of New Zealand is a membership-based organization representing the New Zealand energy services sector, providing training and accreditation services with the aim of ensuring energy management services are credible and dependable.

===Nigeria===
In Nigeria, the Lagos State Government is encouraging Lagosians to imbibe an energy conservation culture. In 2013, the Lagos State Electricity Board (LSEB) ran an initiative tagged &quot;Conserve Energy, Save Money&quot; under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. The initiative is designed to sensitize Lagosians around the theme of energy conservation by influencing their behavior through do-it-yourself tips. In September 2013, Governor Babatunde Raji Fashola of Lagos State and the campaign ambassador, rapper Jude &quot;MI&quot; Abaga participated in the Governor&#x27;s conference video call on the topic of energy conservation.

In addition to this, during the month of October (the official energy conservation month in the state), LSEB hosted experience centers in malls around Lagos State where members of the public were encouraged to calculate their household energy consumption and discover ways to save money using a consumer-focused energy app. To get Lagosians started on energy conservation, solar lamps and energy-saving bulbs were also handed out.

In Kaduna State, the Kaduna Power Supply Company (KAPSCO) ran a program to replace all light bulbs in Public Offices; fitting energy-saving bulbs in place of incandescent bulbs. KAPSCO is also embarking on an initiative to retrofit all conventional streetlights in the Kaduna Metropolis to LEDs which consume much less energy.

===Sri Lanka===

Sri Lanka currently consumes fossil fuels, hydro power, wind power, solar power and dendro power for their day to day power generation. The Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority is playing a major role regarding energy management and energy conservation. Today, most industries are requested to reduce their energy consumption by using renewable energy sources and optimizing their energy usage.

===Turkey===
Turkey aims to decrease by at least 20% the amount of energy consumed per GDP of Turkey by 2023 (energy intensity).

===United Kingdom===
The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy is responsible for promoting energy efficiency in the United Kingdom.

===United States===
The United States is currently the second-largest single consumer of energy, following China. The U.S. Department of Energy categorizes national energy use in four broad sectors: transportation, residential, commercial, and industrial.

About half of U.S. energy consumption in the transportation and residential sectors is primarily controlled by individual consumers. In the typical American home, space heating is the most significant energy use, followed by electrical technology (appliances, lighting, and electronics) and water heating. Commercial and industrial energy expenditures are determined by businesses entities and other facility managers. National energy policy has a significant effect on energy usage across all four sectors.

Since the oil embargoes and price spikes of the 1970s, energy efficiency and conservation have been fundamental tenets of U.S. energy policy. The scope of energy conservation and efficiency measures has been broadened throughout time by U.S. energy policies and programs, including federal and state legislation and regulatory actions, to include all economic sectors and all geographical areas of the nation. Measurable energy conservation and efficiency gains in the 1980s led to the 1987 Energy Security Report to the President (DOE, 1987) that &quot;the United States uses about 29 quads less energy in a year today than it would have if our economic growth since 1972 had been accompanied by the less- efficient trends in energy use we were following at that time&quot; The DOE Strategy and the legislation included new strategies for strengthening conservation and efficiency in buildings, industry, and electric power, such as integrated resource planning for electric and natural gas utilities and efficiency and labeling standards for 13 residential appliances and equipment categories. Lack of a national consensus on how to proceed interfered with developing a consistent and comprehensive approach. Nevertheless, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct05; 109th U.S. Congress, 2005) contained many new energy conservation and efficiency provisions in the transportation, buildings, and electric power sectors.

The most recent federal law to increase and broaden U.S. energy conservation and efficiency laws, programs, and practices is the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). Over the next few decades, it is anticipated that EISA will significantly reduce energy use because it has more standards and targets than previous legislation. Both acts reinforce the importance of lighting and appliance efficiency programs, targeting an additional 70% lighting efficiency by 2020, introducing 45 new standards for appliances, and setting up new standards for vehicle fuel economy. The Federal Government is also promoting a new 30% model code for efficient building practices in the construction industry. Additionally, according to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), the EISA&#x27;s energy efficiency and conservation initiatives will cut carbon dioxide emissions by 9% in 2030. These requirements cover appliance and lighting efficiency, energy savings in homes, businesses, and public buildings, the effectiveness of industrial manufacturing facilities, and the efficiency of electricity supply and end use. Expectations are high for increased energy savings due to these initiatives, which have already started contributing to new federal, state, and local laws, programs, and practices across the U.S.

The development and use of alternative transportation fuels (whose supply is expected to expand by 15% by 2022), renewable energy sources, and other clean energy technologies have also received more attention and financial incentives. Recent policies also emphasize growing the use of coal with carbon capture and sequestration, solar, wind, nuclear, and other clean energy sources.

In February 2023 the United States Department of Energy proposed a set of new energy efficiency standards that, if implemented, will save to users of different electric machines in the United States around $3,500,000,000 per year and will reduce by the year 2050 carbon emissions by the same amount as emitted by 29,000,000 houses.

== Mechanisms to promote conservation ==

=== Governmental mechanisms ===
Governments at the national, regional, and local levels may implement policies to promote energy efficiency. Building energy rules can cover the energy consumption of an entire structure or specific building components, like heating and cooling systems. They represent some of the most frequently used instruments for energy efficiency improvements in buildings and can play an essential role in improving energy conservation in buildings. There are multiple reasons for the growth of these policies and programs since the 2000s, including cost savings as energy prices increased, growing concern about the environmental impacts of energy use, and public health concerns. The policies and programs related to energy conservation are critical to establishing safety and performance levels, assisting in consumer decision-making, and explicitly identifying energy-conserving and energy-efficient products. Recent policies include new programs and regulatory incentives that call for electric and natural gas utilities to increase their involvement in delivering energy-efficiency products and services to their customers. For example, the National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency (NAPEE) is a public-private partnership created in response to EPAct05 that brings together senior executives from electric and natural gas utilities, state public utility commissions, other state agencies, and environmental and consumer groups representing every region of the country. The success of building energy regulation in effectively controlling energy consumption in the building sector will be, to a great extent, associated with the adopted energy performance indicator and the promoted energy assessment tools. It can help overcome significant market barriers and ensure cost-effective energy efficiency opportunities are incorporated into new buildings. This is crucial in emerging nations where new constructions are rapidly developing, and market and energy prices sometimes discourage efficient technologies. The building energy standards development and adoption showed that 42% of emerging developing countries surveyed have no energy standard in place, 20% have mandatory, 22% have mixed, and 16% proposed.

The major impediments to implementing building energy regulations for energy conservation and efficiency in the building sector are institutional barriers and market failures rather than technical problems, as pointed out by Nature Publishing Group (2008). Among these, Santamouris (2005) includes a lack of owners&#x27; awareness of energy conservation benefits, building energy regulations benefits, insufficient awareness and training of property managers, builders, and engineers, and a lack of specialized professionals to ensure compliance. Based on the above information, the development and adoption of building energy regulations, such as energy standards in developing countries, are still far behind compared to building energy regulation adoption and implementation in developed countries.

Building energy standards are starting to appear in Africa, Latin America, and Middle East regions, even though this is a new development going to the result obtained in this study. The level of progress on energy regulation activities in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East is increasing, given the higher number of energy standard proposals recorded in these regions. According to the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, several codes are being developed in developing countries with UNDP and GEF support. These typically include elemental and integrated routes to compliance, such as a fundamental method defining the performance requirements of specific building elements. However, they are still far behind in building energy regulation development, implementation, and compliance compared to developed nations. Also, decision-making regarding energy regulations is still from the government only, with little or no input from non-governmental entities. As a result, lower energy regulation development is recorded in these regions compared to regions with integrated and consensus approaches.

Additionally, there is growing government involvement in the development and implementation of energy standards; 62% of Middle Eastern respondents, 45% of African respondents, and 43% of Latin American respondents indicated that existing government agencies, such as building agencies and energy agencies, are involved in implementing building energy standards in their respective nations, as opposed to 20% of European respondents, 38% of Asian respondents, and 0% of North American respondents, who indicated the involvement of existing agencies. Several North African nations, like Tunisia and Egypt, have programs relating to building energy standards, while Algeria and Morocco are now seeking to establish building energy standards, according to the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. Similarly, Egypt&#x27;s residential energy standard became law in 2005, and their commercial standard was anticipated to follow. The standards provide minimal performance requirements for applications involving air conditioners and other appliances and elemental and integrated pathways. However, it was claimed that enforcement legislation was still required in 2005. Additionally, Morocco launched a program in 2005 to create thermal energy requirements for construction, concentrating on the hospitality, healthcare, and communal housing industries.

==== Mandatory energy standards ====
Energy standards are the primary way governments foster energy efficiency as a public good. A recognized standard-setting organization prepares a standard. Standards developed by recognized organizations are often used as the basis for the development and updating of building codes. They allow innovative approaches and techniques to achieve effective energy use and optimum building performance. Besides, it encourages cost-effective energy use of building components, including building envelope, lighting, HVAC, electrical installations, lift and escalator, and other equipment. Energy-efficiency standards have been expanded and strengthened for appliances, building equipment, and lighting. For example, appliances and equipment standards are being developed for a new range of devices, including reduction goals for &quot;standby&quot; power that keeps consumer electronic products in a ready-to-use mode. Some devices require certain levels of energy performance from a car, building, appliance, or other technical equipment. If the vehicle, building, appliance, or equipment does not meet these standards, there may be restrictions on its sale or rent. In the U.K., these are called &quot;minimum energy efficiency standards&quot; or MEES and were applied to privately rented accommodation in 2019.

Energy codes and standards are vital in setting minimum energy-efficient design and construction requirements. Buildings should be developed following energy standards to save energy efficiently. They specify uniform requirements for new buildings, additions, and modifications. National organizations like the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers publish the standards (ASHRAE). State and municipal governments frequently use energy standards as the technical foundation for creating their energy regulations. Some energy standards are written in a mandatory and enforceable language, making it simple for governments to add the standards&#x27; provisions directly to their laws or regulations.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) is a well-known example of a standard-making organization. This organization dates to the nineteenth century and is international in its membership (About ASHRAE 2018). Examples of ASHRAE standards that relate to energy conservation in the built environment are:

* Standard 62.1-2016 Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality
* Standard 90.2-2007 Energy Efficient Design of Low-Rise Residential Buildings
* Standard 100-2018 Energy Efficiency in Existing Buildings
* Standard 189.1-2014 Standard for the Design of High-Performance Green Buildings

The Residential Energy Services Network is a crucial benchmark for energy reduction (RESNET). The Home Energy Rating System (HERS) of RESNET, which is based on the International Code Council&#x27;s (ICC) energy code, is used to rate home energy consumption with a standard numerical scale that examines factors in home energy use (About HERS 2018). The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has acknowledged the HERS assessment system as a national benchmark for evaluating energy efficiency. The International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) of the ICC requires an energy rating index, and the main index used in the residential building sector is HERS. The mortgage financing sector makes substantial use of the HERS index. A home&#x27;s expected energy usage may impact the available mortgage funds based on the HERS score, with more energy-efficient, lower energy-using homes potentially qualifying for a better mortgage rate or amount.

==== Mandatory energy labels ====

Many governments require that a car, building, or piece of equipment be labeled with its energy performance. This allows consumers and customers to see the energy implications of their choices, but does not restrict their choices or regulate which products are available to choose from.

It also does not enable easily comparing options (such as being able to filter by energy-efficiency in online stores) or have the best energy-conserving options accessible (such as energy-conserving options being available in the frequented local store). (An analogy would be nutritional labeling on food.)

A trial of estimated financial energy cost of refrigerators alongside EU energy-efficiency class (EEEC) labels online found that the approach of labels involves a trade-off between financial considerations and higher cost requirements in effort or time for the product-selection from the many available options which are often unlabelled and don&#x27;t have any EEEC-requirement for being bought, used or sold within the EU. Moreover, in this one trial the labeling was ineffective in shifting purchases towards more sustainable options.

==== Energy taxes ====
Some countries employ energy or carbon taxes to motivate energy users to reduce their consumption. Carbon taxes can motivate consumption to shift to energy sources with fewer emissions of carbon dioxide, such as solar power, wind power, hydroelectricity or nuclear power while avoiding cars with combustion engines, jet fuel, oil, fossil gas and coal. On the other hand, taxes on all energy consumption can reduce energy use across the board while reducing a broader array of environmental consequences arising from energy production. The state of California employs a tiered energy tax whereby every consumer receives a baseline energy allowance that carries a low tax. As for usage increases above that baseline, the tax increases drastically. Such programs aim to protect poorer households while creating a larger tax burden for high energy consumers.

Developing countries specifically are less likely to impose policy measures that slow carbon emissions as this would slow their economic development. These growing countries may be more likely to support their own economic growth and support their citizens rather than decreasing their carbon emissions.

The following pros and cons of a carbon tax help one to see some of the potential effects of a carbon tax policy.

Pros of Carbon Tax include:

* Making polluters pay the external cost of carbon emissions.
* Enables greater social efficiency as all citizens pay the full social cost.
* Raises revenue which can, in turn, be spent on mitigating the effects of pollution.
* Encourages firms and consumers to search for non-carbon producing alternatives (ex. solar power, wind power, hydroelectricity, or nuclear power).
* Reduces environmental costs associated with excess carbon pollution.

Cons of Carbon Tax include:

* Businesses claim higher taxes which can discourage investment and economic growth.
* A carbon tax may encourage tax evasion as firms may pollute in secret to avoid a carbon tax.
* It may be difficult to measure external costs and how much the carbon tax should truly be.
* There are administration costs in measuring pollution and collecting the associated tax.
* Firms may move production to countries in which there is no carbon tax.

==== Voluntary energy standards ====
Another aspect of promoting energy efficiency is using the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) voluntary building design standards. This program is supported by the US Green Building Council. The &quot;Energy and Atmosphere&quot; Prerequisite applies to energy issues, it focuses on energy performance, renewable energy, and other. See green building.

<text>Janice Elaine Voss (October 8, 1956 – February 6, 2012) was an American engineer and a NASA astronaut. Voss received her B.S. in engineering science from Purdue University, her M.S. in electrical engineering from MIT, and her PhD in aeronautics and astronautics from MIT. She flew in space five times, jointly holding the record for American women. Voss died in Arizona on February 6, 2012, from breast cancer.

== Education ==
Voss was born in South Bend, Indiana, in 1956 and grew up in Rockford, Illinois, where she received her kindergarten-6th grade education from Maud E. Johnson Elementary School and Guilford Center School. In 1972, Voss graduated from Minnechaug Regional High School in Wilbraham, Massachusetts. After high school, Voss went on to earn her Bachelor of Science in engineering science from Purdue University in 1975. During her time at Purdue, she was a member of Alpha Phi Omega. Voss continued her education at MIT, earning her Master of Science degree in electrical engineering in 1977, completing her thesis on Kalman filtering techniques. From 1973 to 1975, Voss took correspondence courses at the University of Oklahoma. From 1977 to 1978, she completed work in space physics at Rice University. In 1983, Voss became a Draper Fellow while continuing her graduate studies in the Draper Laboratory at MIT. As a Draper Laboratory Fellow, she worked on developing software for the space shuttle program. Voss earned her Doctor of Philosophy in aeronautics and astronautics from MIT in 1987. For her PhD work, Voss focused on developing algorithms to identify frequencies, damping, and mode shapes for the International Space Station.

== Inspiration ==

Voss has cited Madeleine L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s 1962 novel &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; as one of her primary inspirations for becoming an astronaut. The book tells the story of a young girl who must travel through time to save her father. In the book, the young girl&#x27;s mother is a Nobel Prize winning biologist. Voss claims that the powerful female roles did not strike her as unusual, but were the norms she accepted in life. Voss flew a copy of &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; onboard STS-94 and mailed it to Madeleine L&#x27;Engle.
== Career ==
Voss first became involved with NASA in 1973 while she was still pursuing her bachelor&#x27;s degree. She worked as co-op at the NASA Johnson Space Center until she graduated with her B.S. degree in 1975. During her time at Johnson Space Center she worked on Computer simulation in the Engineering and Development Directorate. She later returned to Johnson Space Center in 1977, and spent one year working as a crew trainer, teaching entry guidance and navigation. After completing her PhD in 1987 she began working at Orbital Sciences Corporation, where she worked on mission integration and flight operations to support for an upper stage called the Transfer Orbit Stage (TOS). In the Fall of 1992, TOS launched the Mars Observer from a Titan rocket and the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite in September 1993.

In 1990, Voss was selected by NASA as an astronaut candidate, and became an astronaut in 1991. She served as a mission specialist on missions STS-57 (1993), STS-63 (1995), STS-83 (1997), STS-94 (1997) and STS-99 (2000). During her career as an astronaut, her technical assignments included working Spacelab/Spacehab issues for the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch, and robotics issues for the Robotics Branch. She participated in the first shuttle rendezvous with the Mir space station on STS-63, which flew around the station testing communications and in-flight maneuvers for later missions, but never actually docked. As an STS-99 crew member on the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, she and her fellow crew members worked continuously in shifts to produce what was at the time the most accurate digital topographic map of the Earth. Voss logged over 49 days in space, traveled 18.8 million miles in 779 Earth orbits, and all of her missions included at least one other woman.

From October 2004 to November 2007, she was the Science Director for NASA&#x27;s Kepler space telescope, a Sun-orbiting satellite designed to find Earth-like extrasolar planets in nearby planetary systems. It was launched in March 2009 and operated through October 2018. At the Astronaut Office Station Branch, she served as the Payloads Lead. She also worked for Orbital Sciences Corporation in flight operations support.

== Honors and dedication ==

Voss received several honors in her lifetime:

* National Science Foundation Fellowship; 1976
*Howard Hughes Fellowship; 1981
*Zonta Amelia Earhart Fellowship; 1982
*Draper Fellow; 1983

<doc id="478938" wikidata="Q611704" url="?curid=478938" title="James D. Halsell">
<text>James Donald Halsell Jr. (born September 29, 1956) is a retired United States Air Force officer, a former NASA astronaut. The veteran of five Space Shuttle missions pled guilty in 2021 to two counts of manslaughter and two counts of assault as a result of a motor vehicle accident in 2016. , he is incarcerated in Alabama. He is the second American astronaut to spend time in jail after Lisa Nowak.

==Early life and education==
James was born to Don and Jean Halsell in 1956. He was raised in West Monroe, Louisiana, and graduated West Monroe High School in 1974. He then graduated from the United States Air Force Academy with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1978. Halsell earned a Master of Science in Management from Troy University in 1983, and a Master&#x27;s degree in Space Operations from the Air Force Institute of Technology of Air University in 1985.

==Military career==
Halsell graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1978, and from Undergraduate Pilot Training at Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi, in 1979. An F-4 pilot qualified in conventional and nuclear weapons deliveries, he served at Nellis Air Force Base, Las Vegas, Nevada, from 1980 to 1981, and Moody Air Force Base, Valdosta, Georgia, from 1982 to 1984. In 1984–1985, he was a graduate student at the Air Force Institute of Technology, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio. He then attended the Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California, and during the next four years he performed test flights in the F-4, F-16 and SR-71 aircraft. Halsell retired from the Air Force in July 2004.

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in January 1990, Halsell became an astronaut in July 1991. A five flight veteran, Halsell has logged over 1,250 hours in space. He was the pilot on STS-65 (July 8–23, 1994) and STS-74 (November 12–20, 1995), and commanded STS-83 (Apr 4–8, 1997), STS-94 (July 1–17, 1997) and STS-101 (May 19–29, 2000). From February to August 1998, he served as NASA Director of Operations at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, Star City, Russia. Halsell also served as manager of Shuttle Launch Integration at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, from July 2000 to January 2003. Halsell was responsible for Space Shuttle preparation, launch, and return on 13 missions. After the &quot;Columbia&quot; accident, he led the NASA Return to Flight Planning Team, responsible for implementing the recommendations of the accident investigation board into the Shuttle Program, and resulted in the resumption of missions in 2005. He then served as the Assistant Director for Aircraft Operations Division of the Flight Operations Directorate. Halsell retired from NASA in November 2006 to accept a position with ATK Launch Systems, where he served as Vice President of Space Exploration Systems, and was the ATK site manager at Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama. On October 10, 2011, Halsell joined Dynetics, as a technical director in their Space Division.

===Spaceflights===
STS-65 flew the second International Microgravity Laboratory (IML-2). During the 15-day flight, the crew conducted more than 80 experiments focusing on materials and life sciences research in microgravity. The mission was accomplished in 236 orbits of the Earth, traveling 6.1 million miles in 353 hours and 55 minutes.

STS-74 was NASA&#x27;s second Space Shuttle mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station Mir. During the 8-day flight, the Atlantis crew successfully attached a permanent docking module to Mir and transferred over 2,000 pounds of food, water and scientific supplies for use by the cosmonauts. The STS-74 mission was accomplished in 129 orbits of the Earth, traveling 3.4 million miles in 196 hours, 30 minutes, 44 seconds.

STS-83, the Microgravity Science Laboratory (MSL-1) Spacelab mission, was cut short because of problems with one of the Shuttle&#x27;s three fuel cell power generation units. Mission duration was 95 hours and 12 minutes, traveling 1.5 million miles in 63 orbits of the Earth.

STS-94, a re-flight of the Microgravity Science Laboratory (MSL-1) Spacelab mission, focused on materials and combustion science research in microgravity. Mission duration was 376 hours and 45 minutes, traveling 6.3 million miles in 251 orbits of the Earth.

STS-101 was the third Shuttle mission devoted to International Space Station (ISS) construction. Objectives included transporting and installing over 5,000 pounds of equipment and supplies, and conducting a spacewalk. The mission was accomplished in 155 orbits of the Earth, traveling 4.1 million miles in 236 hours and 9 minutes.

== DUI and reckless murder charges ==
In 2014, Halsell had a blood alcohol level of 0.12 after causing a crash in Palmdale, California, north of Los Angeles, and pleaded no contest to a charge of drunken driving. In December 2014, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge sentenced him to 60 months of probation, with the conditions that he not drive with alcohol or drugs in his system, and mandatory submission to any drug, alcohol or chemical test.

On June 6, 2016, while on his probation, Halsell was involved in an alleged driving under the influence crash in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. In the crash, 11- and 13-year-old half-sisters Niomi James and Jayla Parler were killed, and James&#x27; father and his girlfriend were injured. Halsell was subsequently charged with reckless murder and first-degree assault. He refused to provide a voluntary blood sample immediately after the crash. He was allegedly intoxicated, and investigators found an empty wine bottle and a packet of sleeping pills in a motel room where he was staying. He tried to steal and make a getaway in the truck of another motorist who had stopped to help. After being booked, he was released on a $150,000 bond.

On September 1, 2016, Halsell was indicted on two counts of murder for the traffic deaths. An initial hearing scheduled in June 2017 was delayed when Halsell&#x27;s lawyers and those from the state were working toward a settlement. Several years later, the trial was set for March 9, 2020, and in January 2020, a judge ruled that prosecutors would not be permitted to tell the jury about Halsell&#x27;s prior DUI conviction. This trial was postponed due to a death in the lawyer&#x27;s family and rescheduled to August 3, 2020.

On May 27, 2021, Halsell pleaded guilty to two counts of manslaughter for the deaths of James and Parler, and pleaded guilty to two counts of assault for the injuries to James&#x27; father and his girlfriend. The guilty plea was given before a judge in Tuscaloosa, with Halsell immediately taken into custody. While sentencing guidelines include as much as two sentences (one for each manslaughter conviction) of 20 years and two sentences (one for each assault conviction) of 10 years, Halsell was sentenced to four years in prison, followed by 10 years of probation with supervised release.

==Personal life==
He is married to Kathy D. Spooner and they have a son and a daughter.

==Awards==
In 1989, Halsell was awarded the Liethen-Title awards for having the best overall flying and academic performance at Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. He received two Defense Meritorious Service Medals in 1995 and 1996. He received the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1998, the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 2001, and the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal in 2002. He was also the recipient of four NASA Space Flight Medals in 1994, 1995, 1997 and 2000.

<text>Scott Jay &quot;Doc&quot; Horowitz (born March 24, 1957) is a retired American astronaut and a veteran of four Space Shuttle missions.

==Biography==
Horowitz went to California State University, Northridge in 1974 where he earned his B.S. degree in engineering in 1978; he subsequently obtained a Ph.D. degree in aerospace engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1982, and then worked as a scientist for Lockheed Company.

==NASA career==
Horowitz joined the United States Air Force and flew as a T-38 and F-15 pilot while also teaching courses in aircraft design and propulsion at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and later California State University, Fresno. He graduated from the United States Air Force Test Pilot School in Dec, 1990 as a member of class 90-A. Horowitz was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in 1992, and piloted missions STS-75 (1996), STS-82 (1997) and STS-101 (2000). He commanded mission STS-105 (2001), a visit to the International Space Station for equipment and crew transfer.

In &quot;STS-75&quot;, Horowitz and Jeffrey A. Hoffman, both Jewish, had alternating use of the same bunk bed, to which Hoffman attached, upon Horowitz&#x27;s request, a mezuzah, using Velcro.
Horowitz retired from the United States Air Force and NASA in October 2004. He returned to NASA in September 2005 to become the Associate Administrator for the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate, in charge of the return of America to the Moon during the next decade.

===Interim===
During his interim away from NASA, Horowitz held a senior executive position with ATK Thiokol, the makers of the Space Shuttle solid rocket boosters. While there, he developed some ideas he had for new types of launch vehicles that used only solid fuel rockets. His ideas were crucial to the development of the mission hardware NASA has adopted for the Vision for Space Exploration. NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin invited Horowitz back to NASA as an associate administrator so he could lead the effort to develop this hardware.

On July 11, 2007, Horowitz announced his intent to leave NASA effective October 1, 2007.

==Space flight experience==
* STS-75 (February 22 – March 9, 1996: 15 days, 7 hours)
:::: Tethered satellite reflight, lost due to broken tether
* STS-82 (February 11 – February 21, 1997: 9 days, 23 hours)
:::: Hubble Space Telescope servicing
* STS-101 (May 19 – May 29, 2000: 9 days, 21 hours)
:::: International Space Station supply mission
* STS-105 (August 10 – August 22, 2001: 11 days, 21 hours)
:::: International Space Station supply mission &amp; crew rotation

==Post NASA==
Horowitz has been active in advocating reorienting NASA&#x27;s focus to human exploration of Mars, with the goals of permanent human outposts and settlements on the red planet. Horowitz is a member of the steering committee of the Mars Society. On one of his space shuttle flights as commander, he had the Mars Society&#x27;s Martian flag hoisted up a mast out of the space shuttle payload bay, and flew the shuttle under the flag of Mars . He later presented the Martian flag that had flown above the space shuttle to Robert Zubrin at a conference of the Mars Society.

In January 2018, Horowitz joined the board of advisors of the DAV foundation.

<text>In computer science, three-address code (often abbreviated to TAC or 3AC) is an intermediate code used by optimizing compilers to aid in the implementation of code-improving transformations. Each TAC instruction has at most three operands and is typically a combination of assignment and a binary operator. For example, codice_1. The name derives from the use of three operands in these statements even though instructions with fewer operands may occur.

Since three-address code is used as an intermediate language within compilers, the operands will most likely not be concrete memory addresses or processor registers, but rather symbolic addresses that will be translated into actual addresses during register allocation. It is also not uncommon that operand names are numbered sequentially since three-address code is typically generated by the compiler.

A refinement of three-address code is A-normal form (ANF).

== Examples ==
In three-address code, this would be broken down into several separate instructions. These instructions translate more easily to assembly language. It is also easier to detect common sub-expressions for shortening the code. In the following example, one calculation is composed of several smaller ones:


Three-address code may have conditional and unconditional jumps and methods of accessing memory. It may also have methods of calling functions, or it may reduce these to jumps. In this way, three-address code may be useful in control-flow analysis. In the following C-like example, a loop stores the squares of the numbers between 0 and 9:


for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i) {
 b[i] = i*i;

<text>The Popular Resistance Committees (PRC; , &quot;Lijān al-Muqāwama al-Shaʿbiyya&quot;) is a coalition of a number of armed Palestinian groups opposed to what they regard as the conciliatory approach of the Palestinian Authority and Fatah towards Israel.

The PRC is especially active in the Gaza Strip, through its military wing, the Al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades. The PRC has planned and executed a number of varied operations, but specializes in planting roadside bombs and vehicle explosive charges - directed against military and civilian convoys.

Formed in late 2000 by former Fatah and Tanzim member Jamal Abu Samhadana, the PRC is composed primarily of ex-Fatah fighters and Al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades members and is alleged by Israel to be inspired and financed by Hezbollah. The present leader of PRC is Ayman al-Shashniya.

The PRC was believed to be the third strongest faction active in the Gaza Strip, after Hamas and Islamic Jihad in 2012. It is currently fighting alongside Hamas and other allied Palestinian factions in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war (2023–present). It has been designated a terrorist organization by Israel and the United States.

==History==
The PRC was formed in late 2000 by former Fatah and Tanzim member Jamal Abu Samhadana, and is composed primarily of ex-Fatah fighters and al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades members.

On 15 October 2003, explosives destroyed a US diplomatic convoy at Beit Hanoun, killing three security guards and severely wounding a diplomat. The PRC initially claimed responsibility for the attack, but later denied carrying out the attack, saying it was against Palestinian interests. The US demanded that the Palestinian National Authority find those responsible and bring them to justice. Palestinian officials said that because of lack of progress in the attack investigation, the US halted financial support for the PA and placed unofficial sanctions on its accounts. After heavy US pressure, the Palestinian Authority arrested several PRC members, accusing them of being responsible. The PRC confirmed the men were PRC members. The PA tried the four &quot;suspects&quot; in a Palestinian military court, but intelligence agencies dismissed the tribunal as a &quot;mock trial&quot; and said while the suspects were PRC activists, they were not those responsible for the attack. The men were released in March 2004.

The Jenin Martyr&#x27;s Brigade was formed in March 2003 as a part of the PRC. Besides other activities, the JMB claimed responsibility for the March 2003 bombing of an Israeli bus in Haifa. The bus was blown to pieces when a suicide bomber, seated in the rear of the vehicle, detonated 10-15 kilograms of shrapnel-laced explosives that were attached to his body. 16 people died in the blast, and another 30-40 were injured. On 17 July 2004, the group kidnapped Palestinian Civil Police Forces Chief Ghazi al-Jabali at gunpoint in an ambush of his convoy which wounded two bodyguards. Al-Jabali was only released after Palestinian President Yasser Arafat agreed to PRC demands that he be fired.

The PRC are also involved in Rafah&#x27;s smuggling tunnels which have been used to smuggle weapons, explosives, fugitives and civilian supplies etc.

The PRC claimed responsibility for the assassination of Moussa Arafat on 7 September 2005.

On 8 June 2006, PRC leader Jamal Abu Samhadana was killed by IDF forces, along with at least three other PRC members. As the man considered responsible for a number of attacks, including the bombing of a children&#x27;s school bus near Kfar Darom in November 2000 and for the 2003 infiltration into an IDF outpost in Rafah that left several soldiers dead, he was considered one of the most wanted Palestinians on the IDF&#x27;s hit-list.

On Sunday, 25 June 2006, the PRC, together with Hamas and Jaish al-Islam (&quot;the Army of Islam&quot;), launched a major attack via a tunnel near the Kerem Shalom outpost. Eight Palestinian fighters used a nearly one kilometre tunnel that they had dug over the past several months to cross under the border between Gaza and Israel. The surprise attack ended with two Israeli soldiers dead and four wounded and the capture of Corporal Gilad Shalit. Two of the Palestinian attackers were killed while the other six made it back to the Gaza Strip with Shalit. Shalit was released five years later in a prisoner exchange.

The same day of the tunnel attack, Eliyahu Asheri, an 18-year-old Israeli student, went missing near the West Bank. The PRC shortly claimed responsibility for kidnapping and murdering him. Spokesman for the group, Abu Abir, also announced that the PRC had formed special units in the West Bank whose sole purpose is to kidnap soldiers and settlers, in accordance with the continued Operation &quot;Cavaliers&#x27; Wrath.&quot;

On 8 August 2007, the PRC announced that it would form a political party to run in future Palestinian elections. It vowed, however, to keep its armed wing intact. In February 2008 then PRC leader &#x27;Amir Qarmoot Abu As-Sa&#x27;id was killed in an Israeli airstrike.

On 25 August 2007, militants from the PRC and Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine attempted to enter the Israeli border town of Netiv HaAsara from Gaza. The militants used a ladder to scale the Israel-Gaza border, and two militants were killed by the Israel Defense Forces.

On 18 August 2011, Israel accused the PRC of committing the 2011 southern Israel attacks in which 8 Israelis were killed in firing and suicide bombing on two buses and a car near the Israeli-Egyptian border north to Eilat. On the evening of the same day, the Israeli Air Force, working with Shin Bet, bombed the homes of PRC members in Rafah. Among the dead, as identified by the group, were their commander, Kamal al-Nairab and Immad Hammad, chief of its military wing Al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades, and at least two more top members of the group and another member. The PRC responded to the raids in saying that it vows &quot;double&quot; revenge for the attack.

On 9 March 2012, an Israeli airstrike in Gaza killed PRC secretary-general Zuhir al-Qaisi (Zuhair al-Qaissi) as well as Mahmoud Hanani.

In July 2013, Hamas cracked down on PRC activities in Gaza, arresting a number of PRC members.

In October 2023, during the ongoing Israel–Hamas war, Israel claimed to have killed the head of PRC&#x27;s armed wing, Rafat Abu Hilal, in an airstrike in Rafah.

==Activities==
The PRC have been involved in a number of bombing attacks on both military and civilian targets in the Gaza Strip, including:

* The 8 October 2000 shooting attack on a bus carrying airport workers near the Rafah terminal, wounding 8 civilians, and a similar attack on a car on the road from Kerem Shalom to the Rafah terminal, killing the woman driver.
* The 20 November 2000: A mortar shell attack against scholar bus children as it passed near Kfar Darom, killing two adult workers, wounding ten young pupils more (one of them lose his leg).
* The 28 April 2001 mortar attacks on the Netzer Hazani agricultural Israeli settlement in the Gaza Strip (wounding five, one seriously), and similar attacks on Kfar Darom on 29 April and on Atzmona on 7 May of the same year.
* The February 14, 2002 killing of three Israeli soldiers using large explosive charges designed for tanks, and similar killings of three more soldiers on March 14 and one more on September 5 of that same year.
* The May 2, 2004 killing of the unarmed and pregnant Tali Hatuel, and her four daughters aged 2 to 11, on Kissufim road. The PRC and Islamic Jihad jointly claimed responsibility, also claiming that the attack was in retaliation for earlier Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) killings of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi.
* The January 13, 2005 killing of six Israeli civilians at the Karni Passage near Gaza, carried out together with Hamas and the al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades.
* On February 4, 2008, the Israeli Air Force assassinated the PRC&#x27;s top military leader, Amer Qarmut (Abu Said) in response to a joint suicide bombing by the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Dimona, which killed one Israeli.
* On March 6, 2008, the PRC detonated a roadside charge near the Kissufim crossing, killing an Israeli officer and wounding three others, one critically.
* Israel-Hamas war (2023–present): The PRC participated in the 7 October attacks, which started the war, and has since fought alongside Hamas and other allied Palestinian factions against the IDF throughout the Gaza Strip.

==Hezbollah connection==
According to Israel, the relation between the PRC and Hezbollah is more than coincidental. Israel alleges the organization enjoys financing and technical support from Hezbollah since its founding, and is a sort of proxy of Hezbollah&#x27;s influence in the Gaza Strip. The organization outwardly projects this relation through its mimicry of the Hezbollah flag which also bears a fist clenching a Kalashnikov rifle and stylized writing.

However, in recent times since the start of the Syrian Civil War the group has distanced itself from Hezbollah and Iran even condemning them for their involvement in the war, the group released a video in June 2016 called &quot;One Nation&quot; where they showed signs labeled with various cities including Aleppo, Gaza, Jerusalem, Fallujah, and Sana covered in blood referencing confrontations involving Iranian backed militias such as the Battle of Aleppo and Battle of Fallujah (2016), while a speaker from the group discussed the group&#x27;s solidarity with Sunnis affected by the conflicts in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen.

<doc id="478949" wikidata="Q382202" url="?curid=478949" title="Jeffrey Williams (astronaut)">
<text>Jeffrey Nels Williams (born January 18, 1958) is a retired United States Army officer and a NASA astronaut. He is a veteran of four space flights and formerly held the American record for most days spent in space, which was surpassed in April 2017 by his colleague Peggy Whitson. He still holds the record of the longest time in space for an American man.

== Early life and education ==
Williams was born in Superior, Wisconsin, and raised in Winter, Wisconsin. During his childhood, Williams reached the rank of Star Scout, the third-highest in the Boy Scouts of America. During the Jamboree on the Air in October 2009 he communicated with Boy Scouts in the National Scouting Museum in Texas from the International Space Station. Williams graduated from Winter High School in Winter, Wisconsin, in 1976. He earned a degree in applied science and engineering from the U.S. Military Academy in 1980, receiving his commission in the United States Army.

== NASA career ==
Williams served with the Army at Johnson Space Center from 1987 to 1992 before training as a test pilot. In 1996, he was selected by NASA as an astronaut candidate. In July 2002, Williams served as the commander of the NEEMO 3 mission aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory, living and working underwater for six days.
===STS-101===
In 2000, Williams launched to space for the first time on STS-101. STS-101 delivered supplies to the International Space Station, hauled up using a Spacehab double module and an Integrated Cargo Carrier pallet. Williams and fellow crew member James Voss performed a spacewalk and then reboosted the station from 230 miles (370 km) to 250 miles (400 km). They returned to Earth after over 9 days on orbit.

===Expedition 13===

Williams also flew aboard the Soyuz TMA-8 mission, replacing Expedition 12 astronaut William S. McArthur. He was previously in orbit as the Expedition 13 flight engineer and science officer aboard the International Space Station. He returned to Earth on September 28, 2006.

During his six-month stint at the International Space Station in 2006, Williams orbited the Earth more than 2,800 times. During Expedition 13, he worked on hundreds of experiments, walked in space twice, and captured more photographs of the Earth than any other astronaut in history. Many of his photos are found in his book &quot;The Work of His Hands: A View of God&#x27;s Creation from Space&quot;, where he shares personal narrative and vivid photos of the Earth.

On August 24, 2006, a taped message made by him to be played at an official NASA press conference was accidentally played over the air-to-ground loop, the tape revealing that the Crew Exploration Vehicle under development to replace the Space Shuttle after 2010 would be named Orion after the famed wintertime constellation.

===Expedition 21/22===
Williams also served as a flight engineer for Expedition 21 and assumed command of Expedition 22 in November 2009 having arrived on the International Space Station with his crew mates via Soyuz TMA-16 which launched on September 30, 2009. Williams with Expedition 22 Flight Engineer Maksim Surayev landed their Soyuz TMA-16 spacecraft on the steppes of Kazakhstan on March 18, 2010, wrapping up a 167-day stay aboard the Space Station.

====First live tweetup from space====

On October 21, 2009, Williams and his Expedition 21 crewmate, Nicole Stott, participated in the first NASA Tweetup from the station with members of the public gathered at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. This involved the first &quot;live&quot; Twitter connection for the astronauts. Previously, astronauts on board the Space Shuttle or ISS have sent the messages they desire to send as tweets down to Mission Control which then posted the message via the Internet to Twitter.

===Expedition 47/48===

Williams returned to space station in 2016 as part of Expedition 47/48. Upon the departure of Soyuz TMA-19M he became commander of Expedition 48. Williams was returned to Earth safely on 6 September 2016.

On Expedition 47, Williams surpassed Scott Kelly&#x27;s record of 520 cumulative days in space which was set when he returned from space on March 1, 2016; Williams beat this record with 534 cumulative days.

==Personal life==
Williams is a committed Christian. Following his return from the Expedition 21 mission, he wrote the book &quot;The Work of His Hands: A View Of God&#x27;s Creation From Space&quot; about his experience in space. The book reflects in Williams words the &quot;vivid lessons about the meticulous goodness of divine providence, God&#x27;s care for His creation, and His wisdom in ordering the universe&quot;.
He is married to Anne-Marie Williams.

==Spaceflight experience==
STS-68 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (September 30 to October 11, 1994) was part of NASA&#x27;s Mission to Planet Earth. STS-68, Space Radar Lab-2 (SRL-2), was the second flight of three advanced radars called SIR-C/X-SAR (Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar), and a carbon-monoxide pollution sensor, MAPS (Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites). SIR-C/X-SAR and MAPS operated together in Endeavour&#x27;s cargo bay to study Earth&#x27;s surface and atmosphere, creating radar images of Earth&#x27;s surface environment and mapping global production and transport of carbon monoxide pollution. Real-time crew observations of environmental conditions, along with over 14,000 photographs, aided the science team in interpreting the SRL data. The SRL-2 mission was a highly successful test of technology intended for long-term environmental and geological monitoring of planet Earth. STS-68 launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Mission duration was 11 days, 5 hours, 46 minutes, traveling 4.7 million miles in 183 orbits of the Earth.

STS-79 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (September 16–26, 1996), the fourth in the joint American-Russian Shuttle-Mir series of missions, launched from and returned to land at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. STS-79 rendezvoused with the Russian Mir space station and ferried supplies, personnel, and scientific equipment to this base 240 miles above the Earth. The crew transferred over 3.5 tons of supplies to and from the Mir and exchanged U.S. astronauts on Mir for the first time – leaving John Blaha and bringing Shannon Lucid home after her record six months stay aboard Mir. Mission duration was 10 days, 3 hours, 18 minutes, traveling 3.9 million miles in 159 orbits of the Earth.

STS-89 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (January 22–31, 1998), was the eighth Shuttle-Mir docking mission during which the crew transferred more than 9,000 pounds of scientific equipment, logistical hardware and water from Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; to Mir. In the fifth and last exchange of a U.S. astronaut, STS-89 delivered Andy Thomas to Mir and returned with David Wolf. Mission duration was 8 days, 19 hours and 47 seconds, traveling 3.6 million miles in 138 orbits of the Earth.

STS-106 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (September 8–20, 2000) was a 12-day mission during which the crew successfully prepared the International Space Station for the arrival of the first permanent crew. The five astronauts and two cosmonauts delivered more than 6,600 pounds of supplies and installed batteries, power converters, life support, and exercise equipment on the Space Station. Two crew members performed a space walk in order to connect power, data and communications cables to the newly arrived Zvezda Service Module and the Space Station. STS-106 orbited the Earth 185 times, and covered 4.9 million miles in 11 days, 19 hours, and 10 minutes.

<text>Daniel Christopher Burbank (born July 27, 1961) is a retired American astronaut and a veteran of two Space Shuttle missions. Burbank, a Captain in the United States Coast Guard, is the second Coast Guard astronaut after Bruce Melnick.

==Early life and education==
Burbank was born in Manchester, Connecticut, and raised in Tolland, Connecticut, where he graduated from Tolland High School. He attended Fairfield University his freshman year before transferring to the United States Coast Guard Academy, where he earned his commission in 1985. In 1987, he went through flight training and became an instructor pilot, serving at various Coast Guard stations at Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod, and Coast Guard Air Station Sitka. He has a master&#x27;s degree in aeronautical science from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in April 1996, Burbank reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1996. After completing two years of training and evaluation, Burbank worked technical issues for the Astronaut Office Operations Planning Branch, and the International Space Station (ISS) Branch, and served as CAPCOM (spacecraft communicator) for both Space Shuttle and ISS missions. He was also a member of the Space Shuttle Cockpit Avionics Upgrade design team. Twice flown, he served as a mission specialist on STS-106 and STS-115 logging over 23 days in space, and 7 hours and 11 minutes of EVA time. From January 2007 to December 2009, Burbank served as a professor of engineering at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, where he taught astronomy, aerodynamics, and statics &amp; engineering design. Burbank was assigned to ISS Expedition 29 and Expedition 30 aboard ISS beginning September 2011.

===Spaceflight experience===

STS-106 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (September 8–20, 2000). During the 12-day mission, the crew successfully prepared the ISS for the arrival of the first permanent crew. The five astronauts and two cosmonauts delivered more than 6,600 pounds of supplies and installed batteries, power converters, oxygen generation equipment and a treadmill on the ISS. A space walk was performed to connect power and data cables between the newly arrived Service Module and the ISS.

STS-115 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (September 9–21, 2006) successfully restarted assembly of the ISS. During the 12-day mission, the crew delivered and installed the massive P3/P4 truss, and two sets of solar arrays that provide one quarter of the station&#x27;s electrical power. The crew also performed unprecedented robotics activity using the Shuttle and ISS robotic arms. Burbank made a seven-hour extravehicular activity (EVA), a.k.a. a &quot;spacewalk,&quot; that completed P3/P4 truss installation, activated the solar alpha rotary joint and enabled the solar arrays to be deployed.

Expedition 29 was launched to the ISS along with Russian cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov, Anatoli Ivanishin and Burbank on November 13, 2011, arriving at the station on November 16, 2011 via Soyuz TMA-22. This expedition spent 66 days in space. Expedition 29 officially ended with the undocking of Soyuz TMA-02M on 21 November 2011.

Expedition 30 Burbank then served as commander of Expedition 30, beginning in November 2011. Burbank, along with Shkaplerov and Ivanishin, returned to Earth on April 27, 2012 after spending an additional 158 days in space.

== Post-NASA career ==
Burbank retired from NASA in June 2018. In 2022, he returned to the U.S. Coast Guard Academy to teach mechanical engineering as a Professor of Practice.

==Awards and decorations==
Burbank has received the following awards and honors:
==Personal life==
Burbank is listed as a member of the astronaut band &quot;Max Q&quot;, and a former member of The Idlers. He is a licensed amateur radio operator (ham) with Technician License K1DCB.

<doc id="478958" wikidata="Q1206001" url="?curid=478958" title="Nakagawa, Fukuoka">
<text>is a city located in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The city was founded on October 1, 2018, making it the newest city in Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 49,400 in 21613 households, and a population density of 660 persons per km². The total area is .

==Geography==
Nakagawa is adjacent to the south side of Fukuoka City and the west side of Kasuga City, and forms part of the Fukuoka metropolitan area. The flatland area in the northern part of the city, centered around Hakataminami Station near Fukuoka City has developed as a commuter town, but other areas are farmland and mountainous, with areas such as Minamihata Dam and Gokayama Dam.

===Neighboring municipalities===
Fukuoka Prefecture
*Chikushino
*Fukuoka
*Kasuga
*Ōnojō
Saga Prefecture
*Miyaki
*Tosu
*Yoshinogari

===Climate===
Nakagawa has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Nakagawa is . The average annual rainfall is 1766 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around .

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Nakagawa is as shown below. When looking at the city as a whole, the population is steadily increasing, but while the population is increasing in some areas in the north due to urbanization, other areas, which make up the majority of the area, are experiencing serious depopulation and aging.

==History==
The area of Nakagawa is believed to be the part of the Yayoi period, Nakoku, mentioned in ancient Chinese documents. It was later part of ancient Chikuzen Province. During the Edo Period, the area was under the control of Fukuoka Domain. After the Meiji restoration, the villages of Andoku, Iwato, and Minamihata were established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889.These three villages merged on April 1, 1956 to form the town of Nakagawa. It was raised to city status on October 1, 2018.

==Government==
Nakagawa has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 17 members. Nakagawa contributes one member to the Fukuoka Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Fukuoka 5th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
Nakagawa is a regional commercial center, and is largely a commuter town for neighboring Fukuoka.The central and southern parts of Nakagawa City are mainly rice paddies, but due to recent acreage reduction policies, an increasing number of farmers are turning to upland farming, and are focusing on cultivating a root vegetable called yacon.

==Education==
Nakagawa has seven public elementary schools and three public junior high schools and one public high school operated by the Fukuoka Prefectural Board of Education. 

==Transportation==
===Railways===
Nagakawa has no passenger railway service. The JR West Hakata-Minami Station is located on the border between Kasuga and Nakagawa, but the station and its platform are within the Kasuga area. The station building, rotary, and bus terminal are located in Nakagawa City, and the area around the station is more urbanized on the Nakagawa side than on the Kasuga side. In addition, although the Kyushu Shinkansen passes through Nakagawa, and the Sanyo Shinkansen Hakata General Vehicle Depot (commonly known as &quot;Hakuso&quot;) straddles border between Kasuga and Nakagawa, there is no Shinkansen station within Nakagawa city borders.

<doc id="478962" wikidata="Q331828" url="?curid=478962" title="Overfishing">
<text>Overfishing is the removal of a species of fish (i.e. fishing) from a body of water at a rate greater than that the species can replenish its population naturally (i.e. the overexploitation of the fishery&#x27;s existing fish stock), resulting in the species becoming increasingly underpopulated in that area. Overfishing can occur in water bodies of any sizes, such as ponds, wetlands, rivers, lakes or oceans, and can result in resource depletion, reduced biological growth rates and low biomass levels. Sustained overfishing can lead to critical depensation, where the fish population is no longer able to sustain itself. Some forms of overfishing, such as the overfishing of sharks, has led to the upset of entire marine ecosystems. Types of overfishing include growth overfishing, recruitment overfishing, and ecosystem overfishing. Overfishing not only causes negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, but also reduces fish production, which subsequently leads to negative social and economic consequences.

The ability of a fishery to recover from overfishing depends on whether its overall carrying capacity and the variety of ecological conditions are suitable for the recovery. Dramatic changes in species composition can result in an ecosystem shift, where other equilibrium energy flows involve species compositions different from those that had been present before the depletion of the original fish stock. For example, once trout have been overfished, carp might exploit the change in competitive equilibria and take over in a way that makes it impossible for the trout to re-establish a breeding population.

Since the growth of global fishing enterprises after the 1950s, intensive fishing has spread from a few concentrated areas to encompass nearly all fisheries. The scraping of the ocean floor in bottom dragging is devastating to coral, sponges and other slower-growing benthic species that do not recover quickly, and that provide a habitat for commercial fisheries species. This destruction alters the functioning of the ecosystem and can permanently alter species&#x27; composition and biodiversity. Bycatch, the collateral capture of unintended species in the course of fishing, is typically returned to the ocean only to die from injuries or exposure. Bycatch represents about a quarter of all marine catch. In the case of shrimp capture, the mass of bycatch is five times larger than that of the shrimp caught.

A report by FAO in 2020 stated that &quot;in 2017, 34 percent of the fish stocks of the world&#x27;s marine fisheries were classified as overfished&quot;. Mitigation options include: Government regulation, removal of subsidies, minimizing fishing impact, aquaculture and consumer awareness.

== Scale ==

Overfishing has stripped many fisheries around the world of their stocks. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimated in a 2018 report that 33.1% of world fish stocks are subject to overfishing. Significant overfishing has been observed in pre-industrial times. In particular, the overfishing of the western Atlantic Ocean from the earliest days of European colonisation of the Americas has been well documented.

The fraction of fish stocks that are within biologically sustainable levels has exhibited a decreasing trend, from 90% in 1974 to 66.9% in 2015. In contrast, the percentage of stocks fished at biologically unsustainable levels increased from 10% in 1974 to 33.1% in 2015, with the largest increases in the late-1970s and 1980s. 

In 2015, maximally sustainably fished stocks (formerly termed fully fished stocks) accounted for 59.9% and underfished stocks for 7% of the total assessed stocks. While the proportion of underfished stocks decreased continuously from 1974 to 2015, the maximally sustainably fished stocks decreased from 1974 to 1989, and then increased to 59.9% in 2015.

In 2015, among the 16 major statistical areas, the Mediterranean and Black Sea had the highest percentage (62.2%) of unsustainable stocks, closely followed by the Southeast Pacific 61.5% and Southwest Atlantic 58.8%. In contrast, the Eastern Central Pacific, Northeast Pacific (Area 67), Northwest Pacific (Area 61), Western Central Pacific and Southwest Pacific had the lowest proportion (13 to 17%) of fish stocks at biologically unsustainable levels.

Daniel Pauly, a fisheries scientist known for pioneering work on the human impacts on global fisheries, has commented:

According to the Secretary General of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development, &quot;Overfishing cannot continue, the depletion of fisheries poses a major threat to the food supply of millions of people.&quot;

The fishing down the food web is something that occurs when overfishing arises. Once all larger fish are caught, the fisherman will start to fish the smaller individuals, which would lead to more fish needing to be caught to keep up with demand. This decreases fish populations, as well as genetic diversity of the species, making them more susceptible to disease, and less likely to adapt to their stressors and the environment. Additionally, catching smaller fish leads to breeding of smaller offspring, which can be problematic for fish. In many species, the smaller the female, the less fecund it is, impacting the fish population.

== Types ==
There are three recognized types of biological overfishing: growth overfishing, recruit overfishing, and ecosystem overfishing.

===Growth overfishing===
Growth overfishing occurs when fish are harvested at an average size that is smaller than the size that would produce the maximum yield per recruit. A recruit is an individual that makes it to maturity, or into the limits specified by a fishery, which are usually size or age. This makes the total yield less than it would be if the fish were allowed to grow to an appropriate size. It can be countered by reducing fishing mortality to lower levels and increasing the average size of harvested fish to a size that will allow maximum yield per recruit.

===Recruitment overfishing===
Recruitment overfishing happens when the mature adult population (spawning biomass) is depleted to a level where it no longer has the reproductive capacity to replenish itselfthere are not enough adults to produce offspring. Increasing the spawning stock biomass to a target level is the approach taken by managers to restore an overfished population to sustainable levels. This is generally accomplished by placing moratoriums, quotas, and minimum size limits on a fish population.

===Ecosystem overfishing===
Ecosystem overfishing occurs when the balance of the ecosystem is altered by overfishing. With declines in the abundance of large predatory species, the abundance of small forage type increases causing a shift in the balance of the ecosystem towards smaller fish species.

== Examples and evidence for overfishing ==
Examples of overfishing exist in areas such as the North Sea, the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and the East China Sea. In these locations, overfishing has not only proved disastrous to fish stocks, but also to the fishing communities relying on the harvest. Like other extractive industries such as forestry and hunting, fisheries are susceptible to economic interaction between ownership or stewardship and sustainability, otherwise known as the tragedy of the commons.

* Tuna has been caught by the locals in the upper Adriatic for centuries. Increasing fishing prevented the large schools of little tunny from migrating into the Gulf of Trieste. The last major tuna catch was made in 1954 by the fishermen of Santa Croce, Contovello and Barcola.
* The Peruvian coastal anchovy fisheries crashed in the 1970s after overfishing and an El Niño season largely depleted the Peruvian anchovetas from its waters. Anchovies were a major natural resource in Peru; indeed, 1971 alone yielded 10.2 million metric tons of anchovies. However, the following five years saw the Peruvian fleet&#x27;s catch amount to only about four million tons. This was a major loss to Peru&#x27;s economy.
* The collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery off Newfoundland, and the 1992 decision by Canada to impose an indefinite moratorium on the Grand Banks, is a dramatic example of the consequences of overfishing.
* The sole fisheries in the Irish Sea, the west English Channel, and other locations have become overfished to the point of virtual collapse, according to the UK government&#x27;s official Biodiversity Action Plan. The United Kingdom has created elements in this plan to attempt to restore the fishery, but the expanding global human population and the expanding demand for fish has reached a point where demand for food threatens the stability of these fisheries, if not the species&#x27; survival.
* Many deep sea fish are at risk, such as orange roughy, rattails, sharks and sablefish. Deep sea fish usually grow slowly because of limited food, have slow metabolisms, low reproductive rates, and many do not reach breeding maturity for 30 to 40 years. A fillet of orange roughy at the store is probably at least 50 years old. Most deep sea fish are in international waters, where there are no legal protections. Most of these fish are caught by deep trawlers near seamounts, where they congregate for food. Flash freezing allows the trawlers to work for days at a time, and modern fishfinders target the fish with ease.
* Blue walleye became extinct in the Great Lakes in the 1980s. Until the middle of the 20th century, the walleye was a commercially valuable fish, with about a half million tonnes being landed in the period from about 1880 to the late 1950s, when the populations collapsed, apparently through a combination of overfishing, anthropogenic eutrophication, and competition with introduced rainbow smelt.

* The World Wide Fund for Nature and the Zoological Society of London jointly issued their &quot;Living Blue Planet Report&quot; on 16 September 2015 which states that there was a dramatic fall of 74% in worldwide stocks of the important scombridae fish such as mackerel, tuna and bonitos between 1970 and 2010, and the global overall &quot;population sizes of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish fell by half on average in just 40 years.&quot;
* Limited supply due to past overfishing of the Pacific bluefin tuna has contributed to occasional astronomical prices. In January 2019, a 278 kilogram (612 pound) tuna sold for 333.6 million yen, or over US$3 million, US$4,900 per pound.
*Sharks and rays: The global abundance of oceanic sharks and rays has declined by 71% since 1970, owing to an 18-fold increase in relative fishing pressure. As a consequence, three-quarters of the species comprising this group are now threatened with extinction. A stark example, caught almost entirely on video, was an incident in Hurghada, Egypt on 8 June 2023, in which Russian Vladimir Popov was killed by a tiger shark in an attack which has been attributed to overfishing of the Red Sea. 
*A study in 2003 found that, as compared with 1950 levels, only a remnant (in some instances, as little as 10%) of all large ocean-fish stocks are left in the seas. These large ocean fish are the species at the top of the food chains (e.g., tuna, cod, among others). This article was subsequently criticized as being fundamentally flawed, although much debate still exists and the majority of fisheries scientists now consider the results irrelevant with respect to large pelagics (the open seas).
*In the United States approximately 27% of exploited fish stocks are considered overfished. 
*In Tasmania, over 50% of major fisheries species, such as the eastern gemfish, the southern rock lobster, southern bulkefin tuna, jack mackerel, or trumpeter, have declined over the past 75 years due to overfishing.

==Consequences==
Overfishing not only causes negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, but also reduces fish production, which subsequently leads to negative social and economic consequences. According to a 2008 UN report, the world&#x27;s fishing fleets are losing US$50 billion each year due to depleted stocks and poor fisheries management. The report, produced jointly by the World Bank and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), asserts that half the world&#x27;s fishing fleet could be scrapped with no change in catch. In addition, the biomass of global fish stocks have been allowed to run down to the point where it is no longer possible to catch the amount of fish that could be caught. 

Increased incidence of schistosomiasis in Africa has been linked to declines of fish species that eat the snails carrying the disease-causing parasites. 

Massive growth of jellyfish populations threaten fish stocks, as they compete with fish for food, eat fish eggs, and poison or swarm fish, and can survive in oxygen depleted environments where fish cannot; they wreak massive havoc on commercial fisheries. Overfishing eliminates a major jellyfish competitor and predator, exacerbating the jellyfish population explosion. Both climate change and a restructuring of the ecosystem have been found to be major roles in an increase in jellyfish population in the Irish Sea in the 1990s.

According to the 2019 &quot;Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services&quot; published by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, overfishing is a primary driver of mass extinction in the world&#x27;s oceans. A 2021 study published in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; asserted that the &quot;primary cause&quot; of ocean defaunation is overfishing. Other studies have shown that overfishing has reduced fish and marine mammal biomass by 60% since the 1800s, and is currently driving over one-third of sharks and rays to extinction.

==Acceptable levels==
The notion of overfishing hinges on what is meant by an &quot;acceptable level&quot; of fishing. More precise biological and bioeconomic terms define acceptable level as follows:

* Biological overfishing occurs when fishing mortality has reached a level where the stock biomass has negative marginal growth (reduced rate of biomass growth), as indicated by the red area in the figure. (Fish are being taken out of the water so quickly that the replenishment of stock by breeding slows down. If the replenishment continues to diminish for long enough, replenishment will go into reverse and the population will decrease.)
* Economic or bioeconomic overfishing additionally considers the cost of fishing when determining acceptable catches. Under this framework, a fishery is considered to be overfished when catches exceed maximum economic yield where resource rent is at its maximum. Fish are being removed from the fishery so quickly that the profitability of the fishery is sub-optimal. A more dynamic definition of economic overfishing also considers the present value of the fishery using a relevant discount rate to maximise the flow of resource rent over all future catches.

===Harvest control rule===
A model proposed in 2010 for predicting acceptable levels of fishing is the Harvest Control Rule (HCR), which is a set of tools and protocols with which management has some direct control of harvest rates and strategies in relation to predicting stock status, and long-term maximum sustainable yields. Constant catch and constant fishing mortality are two types of simple harvest control rules.

===Input and output orientations===
Fishing capacity can also be defined using an input or output orientation.

* An input-oriented fishing capacity is defined as the maximum available capital stock in a fishery that is fully utilized at the maximum technical efficiency in a given time period, given resource and market conditions.

* An output-oriented fishing capacity is defined as the maximum catch a vessel (fleet) can produce if inputs are fully utilized given the biomass, the fixed inputs, the age structure of the fish stock, and the present stage of technology.

Technical efficiency of each vessel of the fleet is assumed necessary to attain this maximum catch. The degree of capacity utilization results from the comparison of the actual level of output (input) and the capacity output (input) of a vessel or a fleet.

==Reducing overfishing==
In order to meet the problems of overfishing, a precautionary approach and Harvest Control Rule (HCR) management principles have been introduced in the main fisheries around the world. The Traffic Light color convention introduces sets of rules based on predefined critical values, which can be adjusted as more information is gained.

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) treaty deals with aspects of overfishing in articles 61, 62, and 65.
*Article 61 requires all coastal states to ensure that the maintenance of living resources in their exclusive economic zones is not endangered by over-exploitation. The same article addresses the maintenance or restoration of populations of species above levels at which their reproduction may become seriously threatened.
*Article 62 provides that coastal states: &quot;shall promote the objective of optimum utilization of the living resources in the exclusive economic zone without prejudice to Article 61&quot;
*Article 65 provides generally for the rights of, inter alia, coastal states to prohibit, limit, or regulate the exploitation of marine mammals.

According to some observers, overfishing can be viewed as an example of the tragedy of the commons; appropriate solutions would therefore promote property rights through, for instance, privatization and fish farming. Daniel K. Benjamin, in &quot;Fisheries are Classic Example of the &#x27;Tragedy of the Commons&quot;&#x27;, cites research by Grafton, Squires and Fox to support the idea that privatization can solve the overfishing problem: According to recent research on the British Columbia halibut fishery, where the commons has been at least partly privatized, substantial ecological and economic benefits have resulted. There is less damage to fish stocks, the fishing is safer, and fewer resources are needed to achieve a given harvest.&quot;

Another possible solution, at least for some areas, is quotas, restricting fishers to a specific quantity of fish. A more radical possibility is declaring certain areas of the sea &quot;no-go zones&quot; and make fishing there strictly illegal, so the fish have time to recover and repopulate.

In order to maximise resources some countries, e.g., Bangladesh and Thailand, have improved the availability of family planning services. The resulting smaller populations have a decreased environmental footprint and reduced food needs.

Controlling consumer behavior and demand is critical in mitigating action. Worldwide, a number of initiatives emerged to provide consumers with information regarding the conservation status of the seafood available to them. The &quot;Guide to Good Fish Guides&quot; lists a number of these.

===Government regulation===
Many regulatory measures are available for controlling overfishing. These measures include fishing quotas, bag limits, licensing, closed seasons, size limits and the creation of marine reserves and other marine protected areas.

A model of the interaction between fish and fishers showed that when an area is closed to fishers, but there are no catch regulations such as individual transferable quotas, fish catches are temporarily increased but overall fish biomass is reduced, resulting in the opposite outcome from the one desired for fisheries. Thus, a displacement of the fleet from one locality to another will generally have little effect if the same quota is taken. As a result, management measures such as temporary closures or establishing a marine protected area of fishing areas are ineffective when not combined with individual fishing quotas. An inherent problem with quotas is that fish populations vary from year to year. A study has found that fish populations rise dramatically after stormy years due to more nutrients reaching the surface and therefore greater primary production. To fish sustainably, quotas need to be changed each year to account for fish population.

Individual transferable quotas (ITQs) are fishery rationalization instruments defined under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act as limited access permits to harvest quantities of fish. Fisheries scientists decide the optimal amount of fish (total allowable catch) to be harvested in a certain fishery. The decision considers carrying capacity, regeneration rates and future values. Under ITQs, members of a fishery are granted rights to a percentage of the total allowable catch that can be harvested each year. These quotas can be fished, bought, sold, or leased allowing for the least-cost vessels to be used. ITQs are used in New Zealand, Australia, Iceland, Canada, and the United States.

In 2008, a large-scale study of fisheries that used ITQs compared to ones that did not provide strong evidence that ITQs can help to prevent collapses and restore fisheries that appear to be in decline.

China bans fishing in the South China Sea for a period each year.

Several countries are now effectively managing their fisheries. Examples include Iceland and New Zealand. The United States has turned many of its fisheries around from being in a highly depleted state.

===Removal of subsidies===

Because government provided financial subsidies can make it economically viable to fish beyond biologically sustainable levels, several scientists have called for an end to fishery subsidies paid to deep-sea fisheries.

Fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly and economist Ussif Rashid Sumaila have examined subsidies paid to bottom trawl fleets around the world. They found that US$152 million per year are paid to deep-sea fisheries. Without these subsidies, global deep-sea fisheries would operate at a loss of US$50 million a year. A great deal of the subsidies paid to deep-sea trawlers is to subsidize the large amount of fuel required to travel beyond the 200 mile limit and drag weighted nets.

&quot;There is surely a better way for governments to spend money than by paying subsidies to a fleet that burns 1.1 billion litres of fuel annually to maintain paltry catches of old growth fish from highly vulnerable stocks, while destroying their habitat in the process&quot; – &quot;Pauly&quot;.

&quot;Eliminating global subsidies would render these fleets economically unviable and would relieve tremendous pressure on over-fishing and vulnerable deep-sea ecosystems&quot; – &quot;Sumaila&quot;.
Over 30 billion euros in public subsidies are directed to fisheries annually.

===Minimizing fishing impact===
Fishing techniques may be altered to minimize bycatch and reduce impacts on marine habitats. These techniques include using varied gear types depending on target species and habitat type. For example, a net with larger holes will allow undersized fish to avoid capture. A turtle excluder device (TED) allows sea turtles and other megafauna to escape from shrimp trawls. Avoiding fishing in spawning grounds may allow fish stocks to rebuild by giving adults a chance to reproduce.
===Aquaculture===
Aquaculture involves the farming of fish in captivity. This approach effectively privatizes fish stocks and creates incentives for farmers to conserve their stocks. It also reduces environmental impact. However, farming carnivorous fish, such as salmon, does not always reduce pressure on wild fisheries, since carnivorous farmed fish are usually fed fishmeal and fish oil extracted from wild forage fish. The various species of Pacific salmon and Atlantic salmon are relatively easy to raise in captivity and such aquacultural operations have existed for more than 150 years. Large scale releases of salmon raised in captivity to supplement wild salmon runs will usually increase fishing pressure on the much less abundant wild salmon runs.

Aquaculture played a minor role in the harvesting of marine organisms until the 1970s. Growth in aquaculture increased rapidly in the 1990s when the rate of wild capture plateaued. Aquaculture now provides approximately half of all harvested aquatic organisms. Aquaculture production rates continue to grow while wild harvest remains steady.

Fish farming can enclose the entire breeding cycle of the fish, with fish being bred in captivity. Some fish prove difficult to breed in captivity and can be caught in the wild as juveniles and brought into captivity to increase their weight. With scientific progress, more species are being made to breed in captivity. This was the case with southern bluefin tuna, which were first bred in captivity in 2009.

===Consumer awareness===
As global citizens become more aware of overfishing and the ecological destruction of the oceans, movements have sprung up to encourage abstinence—not eating any seafood—or eating only &quot;sustainable seafood&quot;.

Sustainable seafood is a movement that has gained momentum as more people become aware of overfishing and environmentally destructive fishing methods. Sustainable seafood is seafood from either fished or farmed sources that can maintain or increase production in the future without jeopardizing the ecosystems from which it was acquired. In general, slow-growing fish that reproduce late in life, such as orange roughy, are vulnerable to overfishing. Seafood species that grow quickly and breed young, such as anchovies and sardines, are much more resistant to overfishing. Several organizations, including the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), and Friend of the Sea, certify seafood fisheries as sustainable.

The Marine Stewardship Council has developed an environmental standard for sustainable and well-managed fisheries. Environmentally responsible fisheries management and practices are rewarded with the use of its blue product ecolabel. Consumers concerned about overfishing and its consequences are increasingly able to choose seafood products that have been independently assessed against the MSC&#x27;s environmental standard. This enables consumers to play a part in reversing the decline of fish stocks. As of February 2012, over 100 fisheries around the world have been independently assessed and certified as meeting the MSC standard. Their where-to-buy page lists the currently available certified seafood. As of February 2012, over 13,000 MSC-labelled products are available in 74 countries around the world. is an MSC project to teach schoolchildren about marine environmental issues, including overfishing.

The Monterey Bay Aquarium&#x27;s Seafood Watch Program, although not an official certifying body like the MSC, also provides guidance on the sustainability of certain fish species. Some seafood restaurants have begun to offer more sustainable seafood options. The Seafood Choices Alliance is an organization whose members include chefs that serve sustainable seafood at their establishments. In the US, the Sustainable Fisheries Act defines sustainable practices through national standards. Although there is no official certifying body like the MSC, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has created FishWatch to help guide concerned consumers to sustainable seafood choices.

In September 2016, a partnership of Google and Oceana and Skytruth introduced Global Fishing Watch, a website designed to assist citizens of the globe in monitoring fishing activities.

=== Global goals ===
The United Nations has included sustainable fishing and ending subsidies that contribute to overfishing as key targets for 2030 as part of their Sustainable Development Goal 14 called &quot;Life Below Water&quot;.

==Barriers to reducing overfishing==

===Tragedy of the commons===
In open-access resources like fish stocks, in the absence of a system like individual transferable quotas, the impossibility of excluding others provokes the fishermen who want to increase catch to do so effectively by taking someone else&#x27; share, intensifying competition. This tragedy of the commons provokes a capitalization process that leads them to increase their costs until they are equal to their revenue, dissipating their rent completely. Causes of the fishing problem can be found in the property rights regime of fishing resources. Overexploitation and rent dissipation of fishermen arise in open-access fisheries as was shown in Gordon.

The fishing industry has a strong financial incentive to oppose some measures aimed at improving the sustainability of fish stocks. Recreational fisherman also have an interest in maintaining access to fish stocks. This leads to extensive lobbying that can block or weaken government policies intended to prevent overfishing.

There is always disagreement between fishermen and government scientists... Imagine an overfished area of the sea in the shape of a hockey field with nets at either end. The few fish left therein would gather around the goals because fish like structured habitats. Scientists would survey the entire field, make lots of unsuccessful hauls, and conclude that it contains few fish. The fishermen would make a beeline to the goals, catch the fish around them, and say the scientists do not know what they are talking about. The subjective impression the fishermen get is always that there&#x27;s lots of fish - because they only go to places that still have them... fisheries scientists survey and compare entire areas, not only the productive fishing spots. – &quot;Fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly&quot; 
Fish are highly transitory and many species will freely move through different jurisdictions. The conservation efforts of one country can then be exploited by another. Tragedy of the commons can result in perverse incentives to increase fisheries subsidy.

===Illegal fishing===
While governments can create regulations to control people&#x27;s behaviors this can be undermined by illegal fishing activity. Estimates of the size of the illegal catch range from 11 to 26 million tonnes, which represents 14-33% of the world&#x27;s reported catch. Illegal fishing can take many forms. In some developing countries, large numbers of poor people are dependent on fishing. It can prove difficult to regulate this kind of overfishing, especially for weak governments. Even in regulated environments, illegal fishing may occur. While industrial fishing is often effectively controlled, smaller scale and recreational fishermen can often break regulations such as bag limits and seasonal closures. Fisherman can also easily fish illegally by doing things such as underreporting the amount of fish they caught or reporting that they caught one type of fish while actually catching another. There is also a large problem with the surveillance of illegal fishing activity. In 2001, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), passed the International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IPOA-IUU). This is an agreement with the intention to stop port states from allowing boats to dock that participated in illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing. It also gives details for port states on effective measures of inspecting and reporting illegal fishing. Some illegal fishing takes place on an industrial scale.

===Territorial disputes===
In waters that are the subject of territorial disputes, countries may actively encourage overfishing. A notable example is the cod wars where Britain used its navy to protect its trawlers fishing in Iceland&#x27;s exclusive economic zone.

===International waters===
Outside of countries&#x27; exclusive economic zones, fishing is difficult to control. Large oceangoing fishing boats are free to exploit fish stocks at will. China is claimed to operate the largest fishing fleet in international waters.

<text>Talksport (styled as talkSPORT) is a sports radio station in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, owned by News Broadcasting. Its content includes live coverage of sporting events, interviews with the leading names in sport and entertainment, phone-ins and discussion. Talksport, alongside sister station Talksport 2, is an official broadcaster for several sporting contests, including the Premier League and English Football League.

The station originated as a non-sport station, Talk Radio UK, in 1995. It relaunched as Talksport in January 2000. In the UK, Talksport is one of the Independent National Radio licensees, holding the INR3 licence for a speech-based service. It is available primarily on its medium wave frequencies 1089 kHz and 1053 kHz, but also on 1071 kHz and 1107 kHz, DAB digital radio, television platforms Sky, Virgin Media, Freeview, Freesat, and Freely, and via the Internet. Outside the UK and Ireland, Talksport broadcasts live commentary of every Premier League match around the world in multiple languages including English, Spanish and Mandarin.

As of October 2024, the network broadcasts to a weekly audience of 3.5 million listeners in the UK, according to RAJAR.

==History==
===Talk Radio era===
The station was originally and officially launched as Talk Radio UK on 14 February 1995 by American-based Emmis Communications, attempting a talk station with a &quot;brasher&quot; style and with shock jocks compared to BBC Radio 5 Live. It launched with the original &quot;Talk Radio Breakfast Show&quot;, however, the first live broadcast had been Caesar the Geezer&#x27;s phone-in which aired the previous night. Other presenters on Talk Radio included Jeremy Beadle, Tommy Boyd, Anna Raeburn, Lorraine Kelly, Gary Newbon, Terry Christian, and Dale Winton. Also in the line-up were Caesar the Geezer, Wild Al Kelly and Nick Miller.

After quitting the Breakfast Show on BBC Radio 1 FM in April 1995, Steve Wright joined the station, presenting &quot;Steve Wright&#x27;s Talk Show -&quot; a live Saturday morning programme. He was joined on the air by his former posse member and comedy writer Richard Easter, as well as female sidekick Georgey Spanswick. The show was guest-focused and popular at the time, but short-lived, as it moved to BBC Radio 2 in March 1996 and re-launched as &quot;Steve Wright&#x27;s Saturday Show&quot;.

By the end of its first year, the shock jocks were dropped, leading to increased ad revenue from advertisers, and the station was bought out by Media Ventures International (MVI). Luxembourg based CLT-UFA eventually became the majority owner of Talk Radio. A year later Talk Radio launched a new breakfast show presented by Paul Ross and Carol McGiffin. Former BBC Radio 1 DJ Simon Bates also joined the station, along with James Whale, Ian Collins, and Mike Dickin.

Talk Radio made its first foray into the world of sports radio rights bidding by purchasing from BBC Radio 5 Live the rights to broadcast Football League matches for the 1997–98 season. In addition, the station broadcast its first FIFA World Cup from France in 1998, bringing in the Sky Sports commentary team of Alan Parry and Andy Gray to commentate on the major matches. Dave Roberts covered additional games in France. Talk Radio also acquired up the rights to broadcast Manchester United&#x27;s matches in the Champions League for the 1998–99 season.

===Creation of Talksport===
On 12 November 1998, TalkCo Holdings – whose chairman and chief executive was Kelvin MacKenzie, former editor of &quot;The Sun&quot; – purchased Talk Radio. This led to a mass clearout of presenters including Nick Abbot, Anna Raeburn, Tommy Boyd and Peter Deeley, with MacKenzie placing an emphasis on a sports-oriented programming schedule, including &quot;The Sportszone&quot; with Alan Parry, Gary Newbon, Tony Lockwood, Tom Watt, and former Century Radio sports editor Dave Roberts presenting the weekend edition of &quot;The Sports Breakfast&quot;.

In late 1999, TalkCo, rebranded as The Wireless Group, announced a relaunch of Talk Radio to become the UK&#x27;s first national commercial sports radio station called Talksport. The relaunch occurred at midnight on 17 January 2000, and was accompanied by the station moving from Oxford Street to a new studio at Hatfields on the South Bank of the River Thames. Now mainly dedicated to sport, the programming lineup was drastically altered, beginning with &quot;The Sports Breakfast&quot; show; this was followed by a mid-morning motoring show called &quot;The Car Guys&quot;, with further sports programming in the afternoon and evening.

Most of the station&#x27;s talk show presenters were ousted at the time, including &quot;The Big Boys Breakfast&quot; with David Banks and Nick Ferrari, with only James Whale, Ian Collins and Mike Dickin surviving. To complement its new format, Talksport purchased the rights to broadcast Manchester United, Arsenal and Newcastle United matches in the UEFA Champions League, the FA Cup, England football internationals, UEFA Cup, England&#x27;s winter cricket tours to South Africa, Zimbabwe, Pakistan, and India, British &amp; Irish Lions tours to South Africa and New Zealand, and rights to the Super League, Rugby League World Cup, and world title boxing Fights.

The new line-up involved a number of presenters and commentators, including Alan Brazil, Mark Nicholas, Chris Cowdrey, Geoffrey Boycott, Mike Parry, Peter Shilton, Brian Moore, Brough Scott, Tom Watt, Gary Newbon, Ian Darke, Tony Banks, and Alvin Martin.

On 25 June 2016, Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corp announced that it was acquiring the parent Wireless Group company for $296 million.

===Expansion of the Talk brand===
Sound Digital&#x27;s successful bid for second national commercial DAB multiplex in 2016 also saw the return of Talkradio, as well as Virgin Radio and the creation of Talksport 2. On 25 June 2016, Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corp announced that it was acquiring the parent Wireless Group company for $296 million. Since June 2020 it has also produced sports bulletins for Times Radio. In 2022 a televised version of TalkRadio launched on TV.

==Broadcast==
Broadcast from London to the UK and Ireland, Talksport is the only British radio station broadcasting sporting discussions and commentaries 24 hours a day, having dropped 39 hours of weekly non-sports content on 2 April 2012. According to the RAJAR audience figures as of December 2022, Talksport&#x27;s audience is around 2.9 million listeners per week. Talksport 2 has an audience of around 344,000 listeners per week.

The 1089 and 1053 kHz medium wave frequencies were previously used by BBC Radio 1 between November 1978 and June 1994. Talksport&#x27;s transmission from the high-power Droitwich Transmitting Station on 1053 kHz can also be received in parts of Europe. In December 2024, Talksport announced that seven of its 18 AM transmitters are set to close, resulting in reducing its AM coverage of the UK&#x27;s population from 92% to 88.9%.

In a number of areas, particularly in areas where the signal from the main 1089 and 1053 kHz transmitters overlap with each other, Talksport operates a number of filler transmitters on different frequencies:
* 1071 kHz: Nottingham, Newcastle
* 1107 kHz: Merseyside, West Sussex, South Kent, The Wash, Hampshire

Talksport is also transmitted across the UK digitally via DAB digital radio, Freeview, Sky, Virgin Media and Freesat. Talksport is also streamed online and available for any Internet connected devices; however, due to rights restrictions on live coverage, some live sport commentaries are not available online.

Since August 2011, several shows on Talksport have been available on Sirius XM satellite radio in the US and Canada.

During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Talksport was available on DAB digital radio in some German cities. The station also partnered with Pure to sell a Talksport-branded Pure One digital radio receiver.

===Talksport 2===
The new station launched on 15 March 2016 as part of a Sound Digital&#x27;s successful bid for second national commercial DAB multiplex. The launch date coincided with the opening day of the 2016 Cheltenham Festival. Former Talksport chief executive Kelvin MacKenzie had proposed a rival sports station as part of Listen2Digital&#x27;s opposing bid for the second national commercial DAB multiplex.

Talksport 2 is a 24-hour sports station which focuses on a broad range of live sporting action from the UK and around the world and includes rugby, cricket, tennis, golf, football and horse racing, plus US sport. On its first day, Talksport 2 broadcast commentary of India v New Zealand in the ICC World Twenty20, Atlético Madrid v PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League and Indian Wells Masters tennis. On 9 June 2020 talkSPORT 2 switched from DAB Mono to DAB+ Stereo to make Room for Times Radio.

In its first two years on air, Talksport 2 acquired broadcast rights to the Aviva Premiership, Super League, ATP World Tour Masters 1000, French Open, ICC World Twenty20, NatWest t20 Blast, Royal London One-Day Cup, Indian Premier League, WGC Match Play, La Liga, MotoGP, ICC Champions Trophy, Premier League, English Football League, Champions League and Europa League.

As of September 2023, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 376,000 listeners, according to RAJAR.

===Talksport International===

==Other media==
* &quot;Soccer Bet&quot; was a short-lived 68-page weekly magazine which Talksport had hoped would appeal to football fans that enjoyed betting on games. It was designed in a smaller A5 format to make it easy for fans to carry and the launch was backed by a £500,000 promotional campaign. &quot;Soccer Bet&quot; lasted just two months before it was axed in October 2003 due to poor sales.
* &quot;Talksport TV&quot; launched in October 2004 platform broadcasting for six hours a day on the Sky Digital television platform aiming to catch listeners who had arrived home from work. The service amounted to little more than the simulcasting of TalkSport&#x27;s broadcasters and pundits presenting the station&#x27;s &quot;Drive Time&quot; and &quot;Kick Off&quot; programmes. The channel closed in 2005 following the takeover of Talksport by UTV Radio.
* Talk Radio was set to return to the airwaves as a station on DAB digital radio in 2008 after Ofcom awarded a second DAB digital radio national commercial multiplex to the 4 Digital Group consortium led by Channel 4. However, the station never launched after Channel 4 announced that it was abandoning its plans for digital radio stations
* &quot;Talksport Magazine&quot; launched in May 2008 as a weekly online-only digital publication to extend the station&#x27;s brand beyond the radio. The magazine was integrated into the newly relaunched Talksport website in 2010

==Controversies==

* June 2000: Talksport caused a stir with the BBC, after it was revealed Talksport had been broadcasting its live commentaries of matches at Euro 2000 from television monitors rather than from each of the stadia, due to the lack of available broadcast rights. Talksport&#x27;s commentary team included Alan Parry, Jim Proudfoot, Mark Tompkins, Alvin Martin and Frank Stapleton.
* April 2002: Tommy Boyd and his production team were dismissed from Talksport after a call from someone who wanted to shoot the Royal Family went through on air. Boyd went on record that he &quot;did not share the views&quot; of the caller.
* June 2002: Talksport broadcast unofficial coverage of the 2002 World Cup taking place in Japan and South Korea. The station flagged up its inability to broadcast live from the stadia, taking out full page advertisements in national newspapers containing the tag line &quot;It&#x27;s unauthorised. It&#x27;s unofficial. And it&#x27;s brilliant.&quot; Jim Proudfoot and Alvin Martin were Talksport&#x27;s main commentary team from its studios in London.
* February 2003: Talksport received over 200 complaints for giving a platform to the controversial Muslim extremist cleric Abu Hamza. Hamza and his aides were invited into the station to contribute to a religious debate on &quot;The James Whale Show&quot;, alongside other Christian, Jewish, and Muslim delegates. On the night of the live broadcast, 24 February, a mass of protesters gather outside the station&#x27;s London studios. Despite this, both Whale and head of programming Bill Ridley defended the station for having invited Hamza onto the programme.
* March 2004: Alan Brazil was dismissed by Talksport when, after spending three days at the Cheltenham Festival, he subsequently failed to show up to present &quot;The Sports Breakfast&quot; on Friday 19 March. He was reinstated less than three weeks later.
* May 2006: Alan Brazil was reportedly given three months&#x27; notice by Talksport after a bust-up with the station&#x27;s management. Brazil and Talksport management held talks less than two months later, and Brazil signed a new long-term contract with the station.
* June 2006: Alan Brazil got in trouble with Ofcom for referring to Japanese people as &quot;the nips&quot; during the World Cup in Germany
* August 2007: Mike Mendoza and Garry Bushell made derogatory comments about gay people, and the station was subsequently censured by regulator Ofcom. Bushell left the station when his six-month contract expired.
* May 2008: James Whale was dismissed by Talksport after twice urging listeners to vote for Boris Johnson in the 2008 London mayoral election. The station was subsequently fined £20,000 by Ofcom in December 2008.
* November 2008: Presenter Jon Gaunt was dismissed for repeatedly calling a local councillor a &quot;Nazi&quot;. Gaunt has since sought legal action for unfair dismissal, but any potential case has yet to go to court.
* November 2008: Rod Lucas was dropped by Talksport, and the company stated they had &quot;no plans to use him in the immediate future&quot; after the membership list of the BNP which was leaked on a Google blog named him as one of its members. The station clarified that this was not a sacking, for Lucas was only a temporary member of staff. The presenter himself said that his membership of the party was part of a covert research project.
* February 2011: Talksport hired former Sky Sports commentators Andy Gray and Richard Keys (Gray had also been a pundit for the station) a fortnight after the pair were dismissed from Sky Sports for being at the centre of a sexism controversy.
* April 2017: Ofcom upheld complaints against Mike Parry and Mike Graham for comments made on their daytime show the previous December, in which they laughed while telling anecdotes about sexual harassment by former colleagues at the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. Talksport said in its statement that the two presenters were &quot;laughing at the lack of action&quot; against sexual harassment.
* August 2021: A caller to &quot;The Sports Bar&quot; said that Tottenham Hotspur owner Daniel Levy would not let Harry Kane leave for free because Levy is Jewish. The remark was not heard on the radio due to a tape delay to avoid offensive callers but was heard on a YouTube simulcast. Talksport apologised and suspended their simulcast until a delay could be enabled.

<doc id="478970" wikidata="Q25109543" url="?curid=478970" title="Standard manuscript format">
<text>Standard manuscript format is a formatting style for manuscripts of short stories, novels, poems and other literary works submitted by authors to publishers. Even with the advent of desktop publishing, making it possible for anyone to prepare text that appears professionally typeset, many publishers still require authors to submit manuscripts within their respective guidelines. Although there is no single set of guidelines, the &quot;standard&quot; format describes formatting that is considered to be generally acceptable.

Although publishers&#x27; guidelines for formatting are the most critical resource for authors, style guides are also key references for authors preparing manuscripts since &quot;virtually all professional editors work closely with one of them in editing a manuscript for publication.&quot;

Manuscript formatting depends greatly on the type of work that is being written, as well as the individual publisher, editor or producer. Writers who intend to submit a manuscript should determine what the relevant writing standards are, and follow them. Individual publishers&#x27; standards will take precedence over style guides.

==Features==
In general, a document with standard manuscript format will have the following features:
* 8.5&quot;×11&quot; or A4 paper size.
* Courier or a similar monospaced serif font.
* 12-point (10 ) or 10-point (12 pitch) font size.
* Double-spaced lines of text (set in a word processor as 24-point or 20-point line spacing according to the chosen font size).
* 24 or 25 lines of text.
* 1, 1.25 or 1.5 inch margins.
* Paragraph indentation of 0.5 inches.
* Printed one-sided with black ink.

On the first page of the document, the author&#x27;s name and contact information appears in the top left corner. In the top right corner of the first page, the word count appears.

Subsequent pages only have text in the top right corner. This text includes: the author&#x27;s name, a slash, an abbreviated title, another slash, and the page number.

==Word count==
Writers can add the word count of the manuscript, although this may also be noted on a query letter. Most publishers pay writers based on a hypothetical number of words in the manuscript. However, this is not the physical count of actual words; this is a rough count of the number of characters divided to better estimate the space that the final text will consume in the published version. Normally, this involves counting every character in the manuscript, including spaces, and dividing by 6. If the correct font size is used, and if the margins are set so that lines contain an average of 60 characters, the editor can easily assume that there are 10 words per line. Furthermore, if the top and bottom margins are set so that there are, for example, 25 lines on each page, the editor can easily count 250 words per page.

==Manuscript handling==
The final reason involves how editors, copy editors, and typesetters handle manuscripts. They might work on an entire manuscript at one time or the editor might hand groups of pages to the typesetter at a time. Unstapled pages facilitate this.

Page numbers, author&#x27;s name, and title on every page ensure that if an unstapled manuscript is shuffled on a table, shared among two or more people, or dropped, it can easily be reassembled, and if a stack of unstapled manuscripts is dropped, it can easily be sorted into the correct sets.

==Other manuscript formats==
There are formatting conventions for different kinds of written works, including:
* Plays and screenplays
* Novels and novellas
* Essays and longer nonfiction works
* Stories and collections of stories
* Poems and collections of poems
* Research or academic papers

<text>Sea Control Squadron 21 (VS-21) was an aviation unit of the United States Navy. It served from 1945 to 2005 and was mainly tasked with anti-submarine warfare while operating from aircraft carriers. It was the only squadron to receive the designations VA-1E, VC-21, or VS-21.

==History==

=== World War II ===
The squadron originally as VT-41 established in the final year of World War II, and served after the war aboard USS &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; CVE-116 helping to develop hunter-killer ASW tactics for the U.S. Navy, and ultimately operated from full-size aircraft carriers in the sea control role, capable of anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare.

=== Late 1940s ===
The squadron was established as VT-41 at Naval Air Station Seattle, Washington (USA), under the command of LT. Joseph P. Keigher, with the General Motors-built TBM-1, TBM-1C, and TBM-3 Avenger torpedo bomber as part of CVEG-41. Commander Air Force Pacific Fleet had designated the squadron upon formation as having anti-submarine warfare as its primary mission.

On 15 November 1946, as part of a service-wide reorganization, VT-41 was redesignated VA-1E, while CVEG-41 was simultaneously redesignated CVEG-1. The group, which consisted of VA-1E and fighter squadron VF-1E, was assigned on 4 December 1946, on the &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot;. VA-1E was identified by the tail code &quot;BS&quot; (call sign &quot;Beef Steak&quot;). In 1947–1948, VA-1E conducted regular ASW exercises aboard &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; between the U.S. West Coast and the Western Pacific. The squadron saw extensive service in ASW trials and tactics development aboard &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot;.
When the US Navy turned back to the designation system used before November 1946, both CVEG-1 squadrons VA-1E and VF-1E were merged into Composite Squadron 21 (VC-21) on 1 September 1948, creating one of six new anti-submarine squadrons.

=== 1950s ===
VC-21 was redesignated VS-21 (Air Anti-Submarine Squadron 21) on 23 April 1950. The squadron became the first US Navy ASW Squadron to depart from the US on a deployment in response to the Korean War on 4 July that year on board the USS &quot;Sicily&quot; CVE-118. During the cruise, they were responsible for the evacuation of wounded US Marine service members from Koto-ri Airfield during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir.

On 3 December, the squadron transferred during the deployment to the USS &quot;Bairoko&quot; CVE-115, moving from the TBM-3E to the TBM-3S ASW aircraft before returning on 16 February 1951. Another Korean War deployment with the &quot;Bairoko&quot; took place between 3 February and 8 May 1953. This was VS-21&#x27;s first deployment the Grumman AF-2S/2W Guardian. In December 1954, VS-21 began to operate the Grumman S2F-1 Tracker. In 1955, the squadron began to display the red lightning bolt on their engine and later tailfins of their aircraft. The following year, the squadron made deployment to the West Pacific and Indian Ocean on board the USS &quot;Princeton&quot; CV-37, becoming the first Pacific Fleet VS squadron to win the Battle E award. This was followed by deployment in 1958 on board the &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; and in late 1959 to early 1960 on the &quot;Kearsarge&quot;, both of these with addition of the S2F-2 variant for the first time.

=== 1960s ===
After returning from its 1959 deployment, in April 1960, the squadron was split in two, with one half continuing as VS-21 while the other half became VS-29. Both VS-21 and VS-29 along with the Helicopter ASW squadron HS-6 were assigned to CVSG-53, embarking on the air group&#x27;s first cruise in 1961 with the &quot;Kearsarge.&quot; Another deployment in 1962 took the squadron to the Pacific Missile Range, deploying the S2F-1 and 1S and 1S1 aircraft. During this cruise, the squadron supported the recovery of Mercury-Atlas 8 on 3 October 1962.

After another deployment in 1963, VS-21 and the &quot;Kearsarge&quot; left what was to become a major Westpac deployment on 19 June 1964. On 5 August 1964, while carrier was inport at Yokosuka, Japan; the ship was ordered to provide ASW protection for US Navy Attack Carriers in the South China Sea near North Vietnam, as a result of the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. By that afternoon, VS-21 and the rest of CVSG-53, which had been temporarily based at NAF Atsugi; had returned to the carrier. In 1965, the squadron transferred to the S-2E Tracker and became the first VS squadron to operationally employ the AGM-12 Bullpup. Three more deployments to the Vietnam War in 1966, 1968 and 1969 also took place, all as part of CVSG-53, operating on board the &quot;Kearsage.&quot;

=== 1970s ===
In 1971, VS-21 was reassigned to the USS &quot;Saratoga&quot; CV-60 to validate the ability to operate ASW units with an Attack Carrier (the CV Concept). This test was deemed successful and as a result, the Attack Carriers (CVA) became Carriers (CV). VS-21 made its last deployment with CVSG-53 and its last Vietnam War deployment between 17 May and 29 July 1972. 1974 saw the squadron being selected to become the first squadron in the US Navy to operate the Lockheed S-3A Viking. That same year, the squadron changed its name from the Lightning Bolts to the Fighting Red Tails. Between 28 June 1975 and 27 January 1976, VS-21 made the first S-3 Viking deployment as part of CVW-1 assigned to the USS &quot;John F Kennedy&quot; CV-67, sailing to the Mediterranean Sea. The squadron also won a Battle E award as well as a CNO Safety Award CAPT. Arnold J. Isbell Trophy for ASW excellence in 1975.

After being reassigned to CVW-9 and the USS &quot;Constellation&quot; CV-64, the squadron deployed on 12 April 1977 to the West Pacific, returning on 21 November. On 30 May 1979, VS-21 deployed with CVW-15 aboard the USS &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; CV-63 with the addition of the US-3A Viking COD aircraft, returning on 25 February 1980.

=== 1980s ===
VS-21 made one operational deployment with the USS &quot;Ranger&quot; CV-61 between 7 April and 18 October 1982 before being reassigned to CVW-11. Beginning in May 1984, VS-21 made five operation cruises with CVW-11 between 1984 and 1990 on board the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; CVN-65, including a 1986 World Cruise through the Suez Canal and taking part in Operation Earnest Will. 

After leaving for another cruise on 5 January 1988, VS-21 and her air wing replaced the USS &quot;Midway&quot; and her air wing on 14–15 February before arriving in the Persian Gulf for Earnest Will on 18 February. Between 18 February and 10 March and then from 19 March and 22 May, VS-21 and CVW-11 conducted operations in the Persian Gulf which included taking part in a supporting role during Operation Praying Mantis on 18 April. During their transit to British Hong Kong, on 5–6 June, one of their S-3A Vikings during takeoff rolled to left and crashed into the sea. Despite ejecting, three of the four crew on board perished, including VS-21&#x27;s CO. VS-21 returned to the States on 1 July 1988.

VS-21, CVW-11 and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; left NAS Alameda for a World Cruise on 25 July 1989. After taking part in PACEX &#x27;89 with the &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; and &quot;Constellation&quot; Battlegroups, VS-21 took part in several war games in the Sea of Japan, Western Pacific and off Okinawa with 48 vessels including the &quot;Carl Vinson,&quot; the Battleships USS &quot;New Jersey&quot; BB-62 &quot;and&quot; USS Missouri BB-64 as well as several vessels of the JMSDF.

More exercises with the &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; and her air wing occurred with VS-21 and CVW-11 while in coordination with the ROK Armed Forces off South Korea between 18 and 28 October. After making port calls in British Hong Kong and Subic Bay as well as avoiding Typhoon Hunt in late November, VS-21 and &quot;Enterprise&#x27;s&quot; Battlegroup conducted operations with &quot;Midway&quot; Battlegroup as part of Operation Classic Resolve during the 1989 Philippines coup attempt. The final operations for VS-21 in 1989 brought them to Singapore as well taking part in war games with the Royal Malaysian Navy

=== 1990s ===
On 27 January 1990, &quot;NH704&quot;, one of VS-21&#x27;s S-3As; had to divert to RAFO Masirah due to partial loss of flight control movement. The aircraft later returned to &quot;Enterprise&quot; on 31 January. After conducting anti-drug interdiction operations with the air wing&#x27;s E-2Cs on 2 March, &quot;Enterprise&quot; and arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 17 May 1990 before VS-21 and CVW-11 returned to bases between 24 and 29 May. Around December 1990, VS-21 began receiving the S-3B Viking with the tailcode of CVW-5, the air wing they would move to 1991.

Temporarily assigned to CVW-14, VS-21 departed with the USS &quot;Independence&quot; CV-62 on 5 August 1991 from NAS North Island. Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 22 August, most of CVW-14&#x27;s squadrons including VS-21 were officially reassigned to CVW-5, while some of CVW-14 and CVW-5 moved to the older &quot;Midway&quot; as it got replaced. VS-21, CVW-5 and the &quot;Independence&quot; then departed Pearl Harbor for US Fleet Activities Yokosuka on 28 August 1991, arriving in Japan on 11 September. VS-21&#x27;s first operation deployment with CVW-5 occurred between 15 and 24 October November 1991, largely occurring in the Western Pacific and the Sea of Japan.

VS-21&#x27;s first Persian Gulf deployment since 1990 began on 15 April 1992, arriving in the region on 10 August. They became the first US Navy VS squadron to take part in Operation Southern Watch when the &quot;Independence&quot; and her air wing were assigned to begin the No-Fly Zone over Southern Iraq on 26 August 1992. VS-21 and the &quot;Independence&quot; were relieved by the &quot;Ranger&quot; Battlegroup on 14 September 1992, before returning to Japan on 13 October 1992.

Between February and July 1993, VS-21 conducted two short deployments in the Western Pacific and the Sea of Japan. On 1 October 1993, the squadron was redesignated Sea Control Squadron 21 (retaining the abbreviated form VS-21). VS-21 made another deployment to Persian Gulf as part of Southern Watch between 17 November 1993 and 17 March 1994, followed by taking part in RIMPAC 1994 during June to July 1994.

During March 1996, VS-21 along with CVW-5 and the &quot;Independence&quot; took part in contingency operations as the Republic of China (Taiwan) held its first democratic elections during the 1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis.

After two more deployments (including one to the Persian Gulf in 1998), in July 1998; VS-21 and the Independence transited to Pearl Harbor to conduct another Carrier swap, arriving on 17 July 1998. VS-21 and CVW-5 moved to the USS &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; CV-63 and departed on 24 July from Hawaii before arriving back in Japan on 11 August. VS-21 and the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf between March and August 1999 as well as taking part in a Westpac deployment between October and November that same year. That same year, VS-21 received newer Vikings from several squadrons including one from VS-29 (April 1999), two from VS-41 (September 1999) and 5 from VS-38 (which VS-21 swapped all of its older aircraft with in Hawaii during November 1999).

=== 2000s ===

VS-21 conducted its first two deployments of the 2000s between April and November 2000 in the Western Pacific and the Sea of Japan. Another Westpac deployment also took place between March and June 2001. VS-21 also assigned several of three of their aircraft to CVW-5 Detachment A as part of Operation Enduring Freedom between 1 October and 23 December 2001. VS-21 made two more deployments in 2002.

On 23 January 2003, VS-21 and the &quot;Kitty Hawk Battlegroup&quot; deployed to take part in Operations of the coast of North Korea due to the latter&#x27;s nuclear and military developments in light of the positioning of US forces near Iraq. VS-21 and the carrier then transited to the Persian Gulf for their last Southern Watch deployment. Starting on 19 March, the squadron took part in Operation Iraqi Freedom, before finishing operations in the Gulf on 23 April, arriving back in Japan on 6 May 2003.

VS-21 made three more deployments during 2003 and 2004 which included its last deployment with the &quot;Kitty Hawk&#x27;s&quot; Air Wing as it took part in Summer Pulse 2004 between 19 July and 7 September 2004. The squadron was finally disestablished on 28 February 2005.

<doc id="478980" wikidata="Q4157170" url="?curid=478980" title="Murder of Wendy Sewell">
<text>The murder of Wendy Sewell was committed on 12 September 1973. Wendy Sewell, a 32-year-old legal secretary from Bakewell, Peak District in Derbyshire was found beaten, sexually assaulted and murdered. In 1974, 17-year-old Stephen Downing was convicted of the murder of Sewell. Following a campaign by a local newspaper led by Don Hale, in which Sewell was purported to be promiscuous, Downing&#x27;s conviction was overturned in 2002. The case is thought to be the longest miscarriage of justice in British legal history, and attracted international media attention.

Downing remains the prime and only suspect in the case, with police reinvestigations finding that all the alternative suspects suggested by Don Hale could be eliminated from inquiries. Downing, meanwhile, was the only suspect who could not be eliminated. He was also recorded confessing to the crime after he was released, although he refused to be re-interviewed by police. Don Hale&#x27;s book was subsequently criticised for falsehoods and inaccuracies, and police considered bringing charges against him for its contents. 

When the law of double jeopardy was changed in England and Wales in 2005, allowing individuals who had previously been acquitted of a crime to be re-tried in certain circumstances, Derbyshire Police applied to the Crown Prosecution Service to re-charge Downing. However, as of July 2022, Downing has not been retried.

==History==
===Assault===
Wendy Sewell was attacked, in Bakewell Cemetery, at lunchtime on 12 September 1973. A witness, Charles Carman, saw her enter the cemetery at about 12:50 pm. She was beaten around the head seven times with the handle of a pickaxe, which had caused severe head injuries and fractures to her skull. She had been sexually assaulted, with her trousers, pants, plimsolls and parts of her bra removed by her killer. When help arrived the woman was still conscious and she then tried to stand up, before falling and banging her head on a gravestone. She died from her injuries in Chesterfield Royal Hospital two days later.

===Trial===

The 17-year-old cemetery groundskeeper who found the body, Stephen Downing, was immediately suspected of committing the attack. He told police he wanted to wash blood from his hands, at which point he was arrested. He later told police that he had found Sewell lying on the ground, covered in blood, and that her blood got on his clothes because she shook her head. He was a virgin and had never had a girlfriend. Despite having learning difficulties and a mental age of 11, he was not cautioned and was questioned for hours without a lawyer present. Officers questioning Downing shook him and pulled his hair to prevent him from going to sleep, and allegedly took bets on who would get him to confess. After several hours of this treatment, Downing agreed to sign a confession. At this point Sewell had not died, and he was only charged with the lesser crime of assault. After he confessed to the assault it was revealed that Sewell had died, and Downing&#x27;s charge was elevated to murder. Downing retracted his confession soon after, claiming he was at home at the time of the attack. There was no evidence to support this claim.

Downing&#x27;s trial took place between 13 and 15 February 1974 at the Crown Court at Nottingham before Mr Justice Nield and a jury. He pleaded not guilty to murder, although he admitted to sexually assaulting Sewell as she lay in the cemetery. A forensic scientist Norman Lee, gave evidence that the blood found on the accused could only have been present if he had been responsible for the assault. Lee described this evidence as &quot;a textbook example ... which might be expected on the clothing of the assailant&quot;. Downing said at the trial that he had been using the murder weapon, the pickaxe handle, to break up firewood. No full transcript of the trial exists, but it is known that, in summing up, the judge drew attention to Downing&#x27;s admission during the trial of having indecently assaulted Sewell as she lay injured in the cemetery. He had also only begun to claim his confession to the murder was not genuine several weeks after he was originally charged. He said he had only confessed because he thought that she had not been seriously injured and would not die.

By a unanimous verdict, and after only 1 hour of deliberations, the jury found Downing guilty of murder. He was sentenced to be indefinitely detained at Her Majesty&#x27;s pleasure, with a stipulation that he should serve a minimum of seventeen years.

Claiming he was in an innocent prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, Downing was unable to be paroled, as he did not admit to the crime. He was classified as &quot;In Denial of Murder&quot; and therefore ineligible for parole under English law.

===The first appeal===
A witness was found who said she saw Downing leaving the cemetery, and at that time she also saw Wendy Sewell alive and unharmed. Downing applied for leave to appeal on the grounds he had a new witness.

On 25 October 1974, the Court of Appeal heard the grounds for appeal and reached the conclusion that the witness&#x27; evidence of seeing Wendy Sewell walking towards the back of the consecrated chapel was unreliable due to some fully grown trees obstructing her line of sight. The witness had also only come forward months after the conviction and after police had previously visited her house to ask if she had seen anything. The court felt that her evidence was not credible and secure enough to allow an appeal against the conviction. After the appeal was rejected, it was widely accepted that Downing was guilty, and the case slipped into obscurity for many years.

During the Derbyshire Police&#x27;s re-investigation in 2002, this witness was re-interviewed and accompanied back to the cemetery location. She reaffirmed that the fully grown trees, which have since been felled, would have obstructed her line of sight. She also revealed the knowledge that she is, and was at the time, short sighted. The witness, who was 15 years old at the time of the murder, was unable to give an adequate reason for why she came forward with her original evidence.

===Campaign===
Stephen Downing continued to deny committing the murder so his family attempted to get support for another retrial, saying &quot;we just want him home&quot;. In 1994, they wrote to the local newspaper, the &quot;Matlock Mercury&quot;. The editor, Don Hale, took up the case and along with Downing&#x27;s family ran a campaign. As part of the campaign Sewell was claimed to be promiscuous and dubbed the &quot;Bakewell Tart&quot;.

Hale found that the murder weapon, a pickaxe handle, was on display at Derby Museum. He organised his own modern forensic examination to be made of it. Mr Downing&#x27;s fingerprints were not found although there was a palm print from an as yet unidentified person. However, the print could have come to be on the handle at any point in time, with it being contaminated over the years it was stored. It had not been stored in protected conditions and had been handled by countless individuals, meaning the print could have been entirely unrelated to the crime.

As a result of this campaign, along with Downing&#x27;s continued claims of innocence, the case was referred to the Criminal Cases Review Commission in 1997. He was released on appeal in 2001, after 27 years in prison. The following year, the Court of Appeal overturned Downing&#x27;s conviction, finding the confession evidence to be unreliable.

===The second appeal===
During the second appeal, held on 15 January 2002, the Court of Appeal accepted many of the reasons that were put forward by Hale and others for believing the conviction was unsafe. Julian Bevan, counsel for the Crown, accepted two arguments put forward by the defence. The first was that Downing&#x27;s confession should not have been allowed to go before a jury. The confession was deemed unsafe because Downing had been questioned for eight hours, during which the police shook him and pulled his hair to keep him awake; because he wasn&#x27;t formally cautioned that what he said may be used in evidence against him; and because he wasn&#x27;t given a solicitor. The Crown also agreed with the defence argument that more recent knowledge of blood-splattering patterns meant the prosecution&#x27;s claim that the blood could only have been found on the clothes of the attacker was questionable. Blood-staining experts, however, disagreed on whether the blood-staining was not from Downing attacking Sewell, and one concluded in 2002 that: &quot;The pattern of bloodstaining on Downing&#x27;s clothing supports the assertion that Stephen Downing battered Mrs Sewell prior to handling and kneeling by her body&quot;.

Lord Justice Pill said that the Court of Appeal did not have to consider whether Downing had proved that he was innocent, but whether the original conviction was fair – &quot;The question for [the Court of Appeal’s] consideration is whether the conviction is safe and not whether the accused is guilty&quot;. What the defence had proved was that there was reasonable doubt about the &quot;reliability of the confessions made in 1973&quot;. His Lordship said: &quot;The court cannot be sure the confessions are reliable. It follows that the conviction is unsafe. The conviction is quashed.&quot;

==Later events==
===Police reinvestigation===
Following the Court of Appeal overturning Stephen Downing&#x27;s conviction, the Derbyshire Police reinvestigated the murder under the name Operation Noble. During 2002, they interviewed 1,600 witnesses, at an estimated cost of £500,000. Downing himself provided his fingerprints for elimination purposes, but refused to be interviewed on the advice of his lawyers. A year after the conviction was overturned, in February 2003, Derbyshire police revealed the findings of their reinvestigation of the murder. 22 other possible suspects had been investigated, many of whom had been suggested by Don Hale during his campaign, and in his book &quot;Town Without Pity&quot;. One of the alternative suspects was Downing&#x27;s father, who had been driving the bus that dropped Sewell near her workplace on the morning she was assaulted. All of these alternative suspects were cleared of any possibility of having murdered Wendy Sewell. Downing, meanwhile, was the only suspect who could not be eliminated. The police had wanted to question Downing about three confessions he made to the murder since his release from prison, including one recorded on audio tape, but he refused to comply. A woman who he was in a relationship with had taped him confessing during an argument, and he was also alleged to have confessed to his father on two occasions in 2002 after his release. Although he had refused to be interviewed for the reinvestigation, Downing issued a formal complaint after the findings were announced, saying: &quot;They said that they would do a thorough investigation into the matter - they have not done&quot;. An independent committee set up to oversee the police investigation later concluded that the inquiry had been completely fair and that they were satisfied with the integrity and rigour of the investigation. Downing&#x27;s solicitor was among those on the committee and himself concluded that the investigation had been fair.

After failing to link any other person with the murder, and unable to eliminate Downing as the suspect, the police declared the case closed and said they were not looking for anyone else. Even though Downing remained the prime suspect, under the &quot;double jeopardy&quot; rules in place at the time a suspect could not be re-arrested and charged with a crime they had previously been acquitted of. The police said that, had the law been different, they would have applied to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to again charge Downing with the murder. The findings of the investigation led to public doubts over whether he should have been released.

===Complaints against Hale and charges considered===
Hale&#x27;s book, &quot;Town Without Pity&quot;, came in for considerable criticism at this time, and it was accused of inaccuracy. A police report criticised Hale&#x27;s book, saying that an analysis of it had showed discrepancies in his story. The man who wrote the report, Deputy Chief Constable Bob Wood, commented: &quot;There are a number of anomalies contained within Mr Hale&#x27;s documentation, and within &quot;Town Without Pity&quot;, that, taken in isolation, have the potential to detract the reader from the facts surrounding the case&quot;. The report further added: &quot;A number of witnesses to whom Mr Hale attributed personal comment have told officers they have never spoken to him. Many witnesses who recalled speaking to Mr Hale say his written version is not their recollection of what was said&quot;. The report highlighted that speculation in the book that Sewell was meeting an illicit boyfriend at the time of her death was incorrect, and said that it was wrong of Hale to draw significance to Sewell&#x27;s &quot;missing bag&quot; and claims that her personal effects were never found, since they had actually been returned to her husband shortly after the murder and never went missing. Police further investigated the book after complaints were raised, considering whether Hale could be prosecuted for its contents. However, it was announced in September 2003 that Hale would not be charged.

===2004 arrest===
In March 2004, Stephen Downing was arrested over allegations of intimidation, having apparently intimidated a female witness in the case. His arrest came four days before the screening of the BBC dramatisation of the case titled &quot;In Denial of Murder&quot;, which concluded that Downing may have in fact committed the crime. As a result, Don Hale complained about the programme. The producers said that it was a more balanced and accurate account of the case than Hale&#x27;s book &quot;Town Without Pity&quot;.

===Double jeopardy law change===
In 2005, the law on double jeopardy was changed so as to allow those who had previously been acquitted of murder to be re-tried if new and compelling evidence was found. This led to police to apply to the CPS to charge Downing, the prime and only suspect, once more. However, the CPS decided that the new evidence presented was not compelling enough for a retrial. Sewell&#x27;s widower David attempted to get the CPS to reconsider their ruling. Downing declined to comment.

===2008 conviction===
In October 2008, Downing was convicted of wearing police clothing in public. He had been arrested in Buxton while dressed as a police officer, which, it was concluded, was &quot;likely to deceive the public&quot;. His jacket had the name of Downing&#x27;s freelance photographic company advertised on the back. He had worn the clothing on previous occasions, and he was fined a total of £1,062.

==Yorkshire Ripper theory==

In January 2014, Chris Clark, a former detective investigating 16 unsolved murders and possible links to the &#x27;Yorkshire Ripper&#x27;, obtained a pathology report which he claimed was buried by the police in 1973 within a few days of the attack on Wendy Sewell. He said it would have completely contradicted the so-called confession, exonerated Downing and prevented a miscarriage of justice, because he said that it revealed that she had bruising on her neck and so must have been strangled. The Home Office said that any new evidence would be sent to the police, and said that any evidence of police misconduct would be referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Derbyshire Police dismissed the claims, saying that the murder had been thoroughly reinvestigated and this revealed that only Downing could not be eliminated as a suspect. They also stated that there was no evidence to suggest that Peter Sutcliffe was involved. Sutcliffe committed almost all of his attacks in west Yorkshire, some 40 miles from Bakewell, except for two attacks he committed in Manchester, which is also about 40 miles from Bakewell.

===&quot;Yorkshire Ripper: The Secret Murders&quot;===

In 2022, a documentary on Clark&#x27;s book about Peter Sutcliffe&#x27;s supposed links to other murders, titled &quot;Yorkshire Ripper: The Secret Murders&quot;, was aired. It claimed that Sutcliffe could be linked to the attack and that Downing must have been innocent, because he said in his confession that he had picked up the pickaxe handle he used to attack Sewell from the graveyard store, and it had actually not been kept there. It was suggested, therefore, that Downing had in fact not accessed the tool. However, Downing had actually said at his trial that he had been using the murder weapon that afternoon to break up firewood.

==Stephen Downing==
Stephen Downing worked for the local council as a gardener in the Bakewell cemetery where Wendy Sewell was murdered. He was 17 years old, with a reading age of an 11-year-old, when he was tried and found guilty of the murder of Sewell. He served 27 years in jail. He had to change prison eight times due to being assaulted by fellow prisoners as a sex offender. He was released from Littlehey Prison in Cambridgeshire in 2001.

Downing&#x27;s release was reported by the BBC as being hailed as &quot;a triumph for campaigning journalism... and an end to one of the worst miscarriages of justice in English legal history.&quot; Downing was reported as receiving celebrity treatment upon his release. He initially found employment as a trainee chef in a Bakewell restaurant, using the training he had been given whilst in prison. After his exoneration, Downing received an interim compensation payment of £250,000, as well as a final undisclosed sum said to be &quot;less than&quot; £500,000.

==Popular culture==
The case was featured in the 2004 BBC drama &quot;In Denial of Murder&quot; in which Jason Watkins played Stephen Downing and Caroline Catz played Wendy Sewell.

<text>Nikolay Mikhailovich Karamzin () was a Russian historian, writer, poet and critic. He is best remembered for his fundamental &quot;History of the Russian State&quot;, a 12-volume national history.

== Early life ==
Karamzin was born in the small village of Mikhailovka (modern-day Karamzinka village of Maynsky District, Ulyanovsk Oblast, Russia) near Simbirsk in the Znamenskoye family estate. Another version exists that he was born in 1765 in the Mikhailovka village of the Orenburg Governorate (modern-day Preobrazhenka village of the Orenburg Oblast, Russia) where his father served, and in recent years Orenburg historians have been actively disputing the official version. His father Mikhail Yegorovich Karamzin (1724—1783) was a retired captain of the Imperial Russian Army who belonged to the Russian noble family of modest means founded by Semyon Karamzin in 1606. For many years its members had served in Nizhny Novgorod as high-ranking officers and officials before Nikolay&#x27;s grandfather Yegor Karamzin moved to Simbirsk with his wife Ekaterina Aksakova of the ancient Aksakov dynasty related to Sergey Aksakov. According to Nikolay Karamzin, his surname derived from Kara-mirza, a baptized Tatar and his earliest-known ancestor who arrived to Moscow to serve under Russian rule. No records of him were left. The first documented Karamzin lived as early as 1534.

His mother Ekaterina Petrovna Karamzina (née Pazukhina) also came from a Russian noble family of moderate income founded in 1620 when Ivan Demidovich Pazukhin, a long-time officer, was granted lands and a title for his service during the Polish–Russian War. His two sons founded two family branches: one in Kostroma and one in Simbirsk which Ekaterina Karamzina belonged to. Her father Peter Pazukhin also made a brilliant military career and went from Praporshchik to Colonel; he had been serving in the Simbirsk infantry regiment since 1733. As far as the family legend goes, the dynasty was founded by Fyodor Pazukh from Lithuanian szlachta who left Mstislavl in 1496 to serve under Ivan III of Russia. Ekaterina Petrovna was born between 1730 and 1735 and died in 1769 when Nikolay was only over 2 years old. In 1770 Mikhail Karamzin married for the second time to Evdokia Gavrilovna Dmitrieva (1724—1783) who became Nikolay&#x27;s stepmother. He had three siblings — Vasily, Fyodor and Ekaterina — and two agnate siblings.

Nikolay Karamzin was sent to Moscow to study under Swiss-German teacher Johann Matthias Schaden; he later moved to St Petersburg, where he made the acquaintance of Ivan Dmitriev, a Russian poet of some merit, and occupied himself with translating essays by foreign writers into his native language. After residing for some time in Saint Petersburg he went to Simbirsk, where he lived in retirement until induced to revisit Moscow. There, finding himself in the midst of the society of learned men, he again took to literary work.

In 1789, he resolved to travel, visiting Germany, France, Switzerland (a plaque in Geneva bears witness to this) and England. On his return he published his &quot;Letters of a Russian Traveller&quot;, which met with great success. These letters, modelled after Irish-born novelist Laurence Sterne&#x27;s &quot;A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy&quot;, were first printed in the &quot;Moscow Journal&quot;, which he edited, but were later collected and issued in six volumes (1797–1801).

In the same periodical, Karamzin also published translations from French and some original stories, including &quot;Poor Liza&quot; and &quot;Natalia the Boyar&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (both 1792). These stories introduced Russian readers to sentimentalism, and Karamzin was hailed as &quot;a Russian Sterne&quot;.

== As a writer ==

In 1794, Karamzin abandoned his literary journal and published a miscellany in two volumes entitled &quot;Aglaia&quot;, in which appeared, among other stories, &quot;The Island of Bornholm&quot; and &quot;Ilya Muromets&quot;, the former being one of the first Russian Gothic stories and the latter, a story based on the adventures of the well-known hero of many a Russian legend. From 1797 to 1799, he issued another miscellany or poetical almanac, &quot;The Aonides&quot;, in conjunction with Derzhavin and Dmitriev. In 1798 he compiled &quot;The Pantheon&quot;, a collection of pieces from the works of the most celebrated authors ancient and modern, translated into Russian. Many of his lighter productions were subsequently printed by him in a volume entitled &quot;My Trifles&quot;. Admired by Alexander Pushkin and Vladimir Nabokov, the style of his writings is elegant and flowing, modelled on the easy sentences of the French prose writers rather than the long periodical paragraphs of the old Slavonic school. Karamzin also promoted a more &quot;feminine&quot; style of writing. His example proved beneficial for the creation of a Russian literary language, a major contribution for the history of Russian literature.

In 1802 and 1803, Karamzin edited the journal the &quot;Envoy of Europe&quot; (&quot;Vestnik Evropy&quot;). It was not until after the publication of this work that he realized where his strength lay, and commenced his 12 volume &quot;History of the Russian State&quot;. In order to accomplish the task, he secluded himself for two years at Simbirsk.

When Emperor Alexander learned the cause of his retirement, Karamzin was invited to Tver, where he read to the emperor the first eight volumes of his history. He was a strong supporter of the anti-Polish policies of the Russian Empire, and expressed hope that &quot;there would be no Poland under any shape or name&quot;. In 1816, he removed to St Petersburg, where he spent the happiest days of his life, enjoying the favour of Alexander I and submitting to him the sheets of his great work, which the emperor read over with him in the gardens of the palace of Tsarskoye Selo.

He did not, however, live to carry his work further than the eleventh volume, terminating it at the accession of Michael Romanov in 1613. He died on 22 May (old style) 1826, in the Tauride Palace. A monument was erected to his memory at Simbirsk in 1845.

==As a linguist and philologist==

Karamzin is credited for having introduced the letter Ë/ë into the Russian alphabet some time after 1795. Prior to that simple E/e had been used, though there was also a rare form patterned after the extant letter Ю/ю. Note that Ë/ë is not an obligatory letter, and simple E/e is still often used in books other than dictionaries and schoolchildren&#x27;s primers.

== As a historian ==
Until the appearance of his work, little had been done in this direction in Russia. The preceding attempt of Vasily Tatishchev was merely a rough sketch, inelegant in style, and without the true spirit of criticism. Karamzin was most industrious in accumulating materials, and the notes to his volumes are mines of interesting information. Perhaps Karamzin may justly be criticized for the false gloss and romantic air thrown over the early Russian annals; in this respect his work is reminiscent of that of Sir Walter Scott, whose writings were at that time creating a great sensation throughout Europe and probably influenced Karamzin.

Karamzin wrote openly as the panegyrist of the autocracy; indeed, his work has been styled the &quot;Epic of Despotism&quot; and considered Ivan III as the architect of Russian greatness, a glory that he had earlier (perhaps while more under the influence of Western ideas) assigned to Peter the Great. (The deeds of Ivan the Terrible are described with disgust, though.)

In the battle pieces, he demonstrates considerable powers of description, and the characters of many of the chief personages in the Russian annals are drawn in firm and bold lines. As a critic Karamzin was of great service to his country; in fact he may be regarded as the founder of the review and essay (in the Western style) among the Russians.

Also, Karamzin is sometimes considered a founding father of Russian conservatism. Upon appointing him a state historian, Alexander I greatly valued Karamzin&#x27;s advice on political matters. His conservative views were clearly expounded in &quot;The Memoir on Old and New Russia&quot;, written for Alexander I in 1812. This scathing attack on reforms proposed by Mikhail Speransky was to become a cornerstone of official ideology of imperial Russia for years to come.

== Commemoration ==
Several places in Russia were named after Karamzin:
* Karamzina village (now part of Ulyanovsk);
* Proyezd Karamzina (a road in Moscow);
* Nikolay Karamzin street (streets in Kaliningrad, Krasnoyarsk, Mayna, Ulyanovsk Oblast);
* A monument was built in honor of Karamzin in Ulyanovsk;
* Another monument was built in honor of Nikolay Karamzin at Ostafyevo Museum-Estate near Moscow Ring Road.
* The Millennium of Russia monument in Veliky Novgorod includes a statue of Karamzin;
* The Karamzin Public Library in Simbirsk, created in honor of the famous countryman, was opened to readers on April 18, 1848;
* In 2016 the Ulyanovsk State Regional Scientific Library organized an open literary competition dedicated to the 250 years anniversary of the birth of Nikolay Mikhailovich Karamzin. For this competition only poems about Karamzin and poems based on his works were accepted.

In 2016 on the occasion of the 250th birthday of the writer, the Central Bank of Russia issued a silver two-ruble coin dedicated to Karamzin in the series Outstanding People of Russia. Two commemorative stamps have been issued depicting N.M. Karamzin: in 1991 in the USSR as part of the Russian Historians stamp series, face value of 10 Russian kopeks, and in 2016 as part of the Outstanding Russian historians stamp series, face value of 25 Russian rubles.

<doc id="478988" wikidata="Q3116113" url="?curid=478988" title="Green River (Duwamish River tributary)">
<text>The Green River is a long river in the state of Washington in the United States, arising on the western slopes of the Cascade Range south of Interstate 90.

The upper Green River valley forms the western approach to Stampede Pass, and was once home to many small railroad and logging towns such as Weston, Lester, Green River Hot Springs, Nagrom, Maywood, Humphreys, Eagle Gorge, Lemolo, and Kanaskat. Shortly before World War I, the City of Tacoma, Washington, filed for water rights on the Green River. Today, much of the upper valley has become a gated water supply watershed for Tacoma and access is heavily restricted, creating controversy among recreation enthusiasts.

Between 1880 and 1888, the Northern Pacific Railway explored and surveyed the Green River. The railway constructed the first direct rail link across Washington&#x27;s Cascade Range with the opening of their Stampede Tunnel in 1888.

==History==
Until 1906, the Green River flowed into the White in downtown Auburn. In 1906, however, the White River changed course above Auburn following a major flood and emptied into the Puyallup River as it does today. The lower portion of the historic White River—from historic confluence of the White and Green Rivers to the historic confluence with the Black River at Tukwila that forms the Duwamish—is now considered part of the Green River. Then, with the opening of the Lake Washington Ship Canal in 1916, the lake&#x27;s level dropped nearly nine feet and the Black River dried up. From that time forward, the point of the name change from Green to Duwamish is no longer a confluence of rivers, though it has not changed location. Thus, the Green River now becomes the Duwamish River, flowing into the industrialized estuary known as the Duwamish Waterway and thence Elliott Bay in Seattle. By contrast, the White turns south at Auburn, and flows into the Puyallup River and later Commencement Bay in Tacoma.

In October 2009, giant sandbags were placed along the levee from Fort Dent through Kent and the Green River Trail was closed to cyclists. The sandbags mitigated the flood potential due to a weakness discovered in the Howard A. Hanson Dam following a January 2009 storm. Repairs strengthening the partially earthen dam by the Army Corps of Engineers have reduced this flood threat significantly. In September 2012, the Green River Trail was reopened following the removal of all giant sandbags.

==Course==
Most of the river above and including Eagle Gorge Reservoir are part of the Green River Watershed, which is closed to public access, creating controversy among recreation proponents for some time. West of the Green River Watershed at Kanaskat, the river passes through the Green River Gorge with cliffs rising sharply as much as from the riverbed. Flaming Geyser State Park, Nolte State Park, and Kanaskat-Palmer State Park are located in this area. The river is a popular tubing spot in the Summer.

Downstream from the Green River Gorge is the half-mile wide Green River Valley, where farmland has been protected from development. An attempt to locate a bike trail along the valley walls has encountered fierce resistance from farmers. As a result, bikes must share the road with autos as it winds through the pastoral landscape.

At Auburn, the Green River emerges from the Green River Valley and enters the much larger Auburn/Kent Valley, which was created by glacial action during the Pleistocene ice ages, then filled in by river sediments and lahars from Mount Rainier. After flowing generally west from its source, at Auburn the river turns north, entering a zone of light-industrial and retail development. A public multiuse trail runs along the river through most of this valley.

==Green River Killer==

The Green River is infamous as the location where the first victims of serial killer Gary Ridgway were found in the early 1980s. Most of these victims were sex workers that worked an active &quot;stroll&quot; along Pacific Highway South. Although only a few bodies were found in the river, the unidentified killer was known as the &quot;Green River Killer&quot;. These murders went unsolved for over 20 years. For many years, Dave Reichert led the investigation as a detective of the King County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. Ridgway made a plea agreement with King County Prosecuting Attorney Norm Maleng to cooperate with police in order to escape execution. In November 2003, Gary Ridgway pleaded guilty to 48 counts of Aggravated First Degree Murder. King County Superior Court Judge Richard A. Jones sentenced Ridgway to 48 consecutive life sentences. Ridgway will never be eligible for parole.

<doc id="478990" wikidata="Q3398745" url="?curid=478990" title="Portage Bay">
<text>Portage Bay is a body of water, often thought of as the eastern arm of Lake Union, that forms a part of the Lake Washington Ship Canal in Seattle, Washington.

To the east, Portage Bay is connected with Union Bay—a part of Lake Washington—by the Montlake Cut, over which spans the Montlake Bridge carrying State Route 513. To the north is the campus of the University of Washington. To the west, Portage Bay is spanned by the University Bridge, which carries Eastlake Avenue between Eastlake and the University District. Its westernmost limit can be said to be the Ship Canal Bridge, which carries Interstate 5 over the water; past this bridge, the body of water is deemed to be Lake Union. In the southern portion, Portage Bay is spanned by the Portage Bay Viaduct, which carries State Route 520 from the Eastlake/Capitol Hill district to Montlake.

Portage Bay was named in 1913 because of the portage across the Montlake Isthmus that used to be necessary to move logs from Union Bay to Lake Union before the construction of the Ship Canal. The bay is home to two yacht clubs, the Seattle and the Queen City, and many houseboats, as well as the Northwest Fisheries Science Center of the National Marine Fisheries Service and the University of Washington&#x27;s College of Ocean and Fishery Science.

==History==

In 1860 (or, more likely, some time slightly later), landowner Harvey Pike tried to cut the first ditch connecting Lake Washington&#x27;s Union Bay and Lake Union&#x27;s Portage Bay, but gave up and deeded his land to the Lake Washington Ship Canal Company, which built a transiting rail line for portaging goods between the lakes. This rail line continued use until 1878. In 1883, David Denny and Thomas Burke had a canal built for floating logs.

Cheshiahud lived and carved canoes on the shores of Portage Bay for many years from 1885. 
In 1909, the Pay Streak, a vaudeville and sideshows section of the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition, ended in a gondola ramp and esplanade on the north shores of Portage Bay.

For 14 years following World War II, the &quot;Fantome&quot; was stranded in Portage Bay pending payment to King County of back taxes.

A university police station was located on the north shore of Portage Bay until the 2010s, when it was demolished to make way for a public park. Fritz Hedges Waterway Park opened in October 2020, using funding from the Washington State Department of Transportation as part of remediation for the State Route 520 expansion program.

==Neighborhood==

The small residential neighborhood of Portage Bay is located on the southwestern shore of the bay. It is bounded on the south by State Route 520 and on the west by Interstate 5, and features one of the larger remaining enclaves of Houseboats in Seattle.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Ashiya is as shown below

==History==
The area of Ashiya was part of ancient Chikuzen Province. Shell middens left by the Jomon people are scattered around the midstream to the mouth of the ancient Onga River, and among these shell middens, one known as the Yamaga Shell Midden is particularly famous nationwide. In the late Yayoi period, the area was called &quot;Oka no Tsu&quot; and was famous as one of the three major military ports, along with Toyotsu and Usa. At that time, it was a deep and vast bay, but due to the accumulation of earth and sand from the Onga River over the years and land reclamation, there is no trace of what it once was. The name &quot;Ashiya&quot; appears in mid-Heian period documents. In 1185, it was the site of the Battle of Ashiyaura in the Genpei War. In the Kamakura period, the port was regards as equal to that of Shimonoseki. From the Edo period, it prospered as a post town on the highway to Karatsu and was under the control of Fukuoka Domain. After the Meiji restoration, the village of Ashiya was established on May 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. It was raised to town status on June 10, 1891. However, railway lines bypassed the area (due to its proximity to the Korean Peninsula and the Sea of Japan, construction was avoided from a defense perspective), and the area gradually became isolated.

==Government==
Ashiya has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 12 members. Ashiya, collectively with the other municipalities of Onga District, contributes two members to the Fukuoka Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of the Fukuoka 8th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
Ashiya has developed as a commercial center around the military base, with some residual agriculture and commercial fishing. The town is increasingly a commuter town for neighboring Kitakyushu. 

==Education==
Ashiya has three public elementary schools and one public junior high school operated by the town government. The town does not have a high school.

==Transportation==
===Railways===
Ashiya does not have any commercial railway services. The nearest train stations are or on the JR Kyushu Kagoshima Main Line.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Mizumaki is as shown below

==History==
The area of Mizumaki was part of ancient Chikuzen Province. About 3000 years ago, the large Ko-Onga Bay covered the area where the town of Mizumaki now lies. Soil and silt carried by the Onga River gradually built up until a flat plain was built up in the area. People began living and planting rice crops on that ground. Terrible floods continually plagued the area. During the Edo Period the area was under the control of Fukuoka Domain. After the Meiji restoration, the village of Mizumaki was established on May 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. Mizumaki was raised to town status on February 1, 1940. 

Mizumaki was the site of &quot;Japan Coal Mining Company, Onga Coal Mine&quot; which used forced laborers in the mine, particularly Dutch, American and British POWs in World War II. A memorial called &quot;The Memorial Cross &quot; commemorates the allied POWs who died during the war.

== Economy ==
During the Meiji period, Mizumaki, along with the municipalities of the Chikuho area, developed with the Kitakyushu industrial zone through coal mining, and is still considered part of to the Greater Kitakyushu Metropolitan Area. However, as the demand for coal decreased due to the energy revolution, the coal mines that had sponsored prosperity have closed, leading to depopulation. The population continued to decline as coal mines closed. However, as the city began to develop as a commuter town by taking advantage of its location near Kitakyushu City,

==Education==
Mizumaki has five public elementary schools and two public junior high schools operated by the town government. The town does not have a high school.

<text>The Green River, located in the western United States, is the chief tributary of the Colorado River. The watershed of the river, known as the Green River Basin, covers parts of the U.S. states of Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado. The Green River is long, beginning in the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming and flowing through Wyoming and Utah for most of its course, except for a short segment of in western Colorado. Much of the route traverses the arid Colorado Plateau, where the river has carved some of the most spectacular canyons in the United States. The Green is slightly smaller than Colorado when the two rivers merge but typically carries a larger load of silt. The average yearly mean flow of the river at Green River, Utah is per second.

The status of the Green River as a tributary of the Colorado River came about mainly for political reasons. In earlier nomenclature, the Colorado River began at its confluence with the Green River. Above the confluence, Colorado was called the Grand River. In 1921, U.S. Representative Edward T. Taylor of Colorado petitioned the Congressional Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce to rename the Grand River as the Colorado River. On July 25, 1921, the name change was made official in House Joint Resolution 460 of the 66th Congress, over the objections of representatives from Wyoming and Utah and the United States Geological Survey, which noted that the drainage basin of the Green River was more extensive than that of the Grand River, although the Grand carried a higher volume of water at its confluence with the Green.

The Green River is the subject of the song &quot;Green River&quot; by C.W. McCall.

== Description ==

The headwaters of the Green River is in western Wyoming, in northern Sublette County, on the western side of the Continental Divide in the Wind River Range and the Bridger–Teton National Forest. It flows south through Sublette County and western Wyoming in an area known as the Upper Green River Valley, then southwest and is joined by the Big Sandy River in western Sweetwater County. At the town of La Barge, it flows into Fontenelle Reservoir, formed by Fontenelle Dam. Below the dam, it flows through open sage-covered rolling prairie where it is crossed by the Oregon, California and Mormon emigration trails, and then further south past the town of Green River, Wyoming and into the Flaming Gorge Reservoir in southwestern Wyoming, formed by the Flaming Gorge Dam in northeastern Utah. Before the reservoir&#x27;s creation, the Blacks Fork joined the Green River south of the town of Green River, but today the mouth of Blacks Fork is submerged by the reservoir.

South of the dam, it is forced to turn sharply eastward by the uplift of the Uinta Mountains, looping around the eastern tip of the range as it travels from Utah into northwestern Colorado and through Browns Park before turning west and then south into Dinosaur National Monument, where it passes through the Canyon of the Lodore (otherwise known as the Gates of Lodore) and is joined by the Yampa River at Steamboat Rock. It turns westward back into Utah along the southern edge of the Uintas in Whirlpool Canyon. In Utah, it meanders southwest across the Yampa Plateau and through the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation and the Ouray National Wildlife Refuge. Two miles south of Ouray, Utah, it is joined by the Duchesne River, and three miles (5 km) farther downstream by the White River. Ten miles farther downstream, it is joined by the Willow River.

South of the plateau, it is joined by Nine Mile Creek, then enters the Roan Cliffs where it flows south through the back-to-back Desolation and Gray canyons, with a combined length of 120 mi (192 km). In Gray Canyon, it is joined by the Price River. South of the canyon, it passes the town of Green River, Utah and is joined by the San Rafael River in southern Emery County. In eastern Wayne County it meanders through Canyonlands National Park, where it joins Colorado.

The Flaming Gorge Dam in Utah is a significant regional source of water for irrigation and mining, as well as for hydroelectric power. Begun in the 1950s and finished in 1963, it was highly controversial and opposed by conservationists. Originally, a dam was to be built in Whirlpool Canyon, but the conservationist movement traded the Flaming Gorge Dam for halting that proposal.
The Green is a large, deep, powerful river. It ranges from 100 to 300 feet (30 to 100 m) wide in the upper course and from wide in its lower course, and from in depth. It is navigable by small craft throughout its course and by large motorboats upstream to Flaming Gorge Dam. Near the areas where the Oregon Trail crosses the river, it is wide and averages about deep at normal flow.
==History==


Archaeological evidence indicates that the tributary canyons and sheltered areas in the river valley were home to the Fremont Culture, which flourished from the 7th century to the 13th century. The Fremont were semi-nomadic people who lived in pithouses and are best known for the rock art on canyon walls and in sheltered overhangs.

In later centuries, the river basin was home to the Shoshone and Ute peoples, both nomadic hunters. The Shoshone inhabited the river valley north of the Uinta Mountains, whereas the Utes lived to the south. The current reservation of the Utes is in the Uintah Basin. The Shoshone called the river the &quot;Seeds-kee-dee-Agie&quot;, meaning &quot;Prairie Hen River.&quot;

In 1776, the Spanish friars Silvestre Vélez de Escalante and Francisco Atanasio Domínguez crossed the river near present-day Jensen, naming it the Rio de San Buenaventura. The map-maker of the expedition, Captain Bernardo Miera y Pacheco, erroneously indicated that the river flowed southwest to what is now known as Sevier Lake. Later cartographers extended the error, representing the Buenaventura River as flowing into the Pacific Ocean. At least one charted the Buenaventura as draining the Great Salt Lake. Later, Spanish and Mexican explorers adopted the name Rio Verde, meaning &quot;Green River&quot; in Spanish. Exactly when the Spanish started using this name and why is unknown. Explanations of the name &quot;Green&quot; include ideas about the color of the water (though it is usually just as red as that of the Colorado), the color of soapstone along its banks, the color of the vegetation, and the name of a trapper. No explanation can be verified. Wilson Hunt of John Jacob Astor&#x27;s Pacific Fur Company called it The Spanish River in 1811. By that time it was clear to the trappers that Miera&#x27;s map (if they had seen it) was wrong, for they had learned from the Native Americans that the Green River drained to the Colorado River and the Gulf of California. When Jedediah Smith reached the lower Colorado in 1826, he first called it the Seedskeedee, as the Green/Colorado River was commonly known among the trappers. By the time of Bonneville&#x27;s expedition in 1832, the names &quot;Seeds-kee-dee&quot;, &quot;Spanish River&quot;, &quot;Green River&quot;, and even &quot;Colorado River&quot; were used interchangeably by the trappers and American explorers.

While it was known that the Green River drained to Colorado, the exact course was not known. Miera&#x27;s map showed the Colorado River branching into two major streams – the Nabajoo (San Juan) and the Zaguananas. It also showed the Zaguananas branching into four heads, including the Dolores and the Rafael (the latter of which Escalante&#x27;s journal equates with Colorado per information from the Native Americans). A map of 1847 redirects the course of the Rafael to the north and labels it as Green River. It would be some time before the true confluence of the Green and Colorado Rivers would be known.

The Old Spanish Trail from New Mexico to California crossed the river just above the present-day town of Green River, Utah.

In the early 19th century, the upper river in Wyoming was part of the disputed Oregon Country. It was explored by trappers from the North West Company and Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, such as Donald Mackenzie who pioneered the area from 1819. In 1825, the American William Ashley and a party of American explorers floated down the river from north of the Uintah Mountains to the mouth of the White River. The valley of the river became increasingly used as a wintering ground for American trappers in the next decades, with trading posts established at the mouth of the White near Whiterocks, Utah, and Browns Park. The Upper Green River Rendezvous Site near Pinedale, Wyoming was a popular location for annual mountain man rendezvous during the 1820s and 1830s, with as many as 450 to 500 trappers attending during its heyday in the 1830s.

The region was explored by John C. Fremont on several of his expeditions in the 1840s. Fremont corrected the cartographic error of Miera, establishing firmly that the river did not drain the Great Salt Lake. In 1869, the river was surveyed and mapped by John Wesley Powell as part of the first of his two expeditions to the region. During his two voyages in 1869 and 1871, he and his men gave most of the current names of the canyons, geographic features, and rapids along the river. For example, &quot;we sweep around another great bend to the left, making a circuit of nine miles, and come back to a point within 600 feet of the beginning of the bend. In the two circuits, we describe almost in figure 8. The men call it a `bowknot&#x27; of a river; so we name it Bowknot Bend.&quot; (Powell, 1869)

From the 1840s through the 1860s, hundreds of thousands of emigrants made their way west along the Oregon, California, and Mormon emigration trails. Nearly all primary emigration routes had to cross the Green River. The main trail crossed near where the Big Sandy River joins the Green River in Wyoming. The river is too big and much too deep to ford at any time of the year and is the largest, most dangerous river crossed by the Oregon Trail. For that reason, ferries were commonly run on this stretch of the river. Some popular ferries included the Lombard and Robinson ferries at the main crossing and the Mormon, Mountain Man, and Names Hill ferries where the popular Sublette-Greenwood cutoff crossed the river further upstream.

In 1878 the first permanent settlement in the river valley was founded at Vernal by a party of Mormons led by Jeremiah Hatch. The settlement survived a diphtheria epidemic its first winter, as well as a panic caused by the Meeker Massacre in Colorado.

Most of the land in the valley of the river today is owned and controlled by the federal government. Private holdings are largely limited to bottoms. Until the 1940s, the valley&#x27;s economy was based largely on ranching. Tourism has emerged as the dominant industry in the region in the last several decades.

A proposed nuclear power plant, the Blue Castle Project, is set to begin construction near Green River in 2023. The plant will use of water annually from the Green River once both reactors are commissioned.

==Natural resources==
The La Barge oil field was discovered in 1924. Oil was produced from Tertiary sandstones (Wasatch Formation and Green River Formation), within an anticline 600 to 1200 feet deep. The Big Piney-La Barge complex has produced gas since 1956 and oil since 1960. Cumulative production by 1976 was 65 million bbl of oil and over 1.2 Tcf (trillion cubic feet) of gas. Production includes the Cretaceous Mesaverde Formation and Frontier Formation.

The discovery of petroleum at the Ashley Field after World War II has led to the exploitation of oil and natural gas in the region. The oil at Ashley Field is trapped in Aeolin deposits of &quot;coversands and loess,&quot; while there is a larger deposit of oil shale in the Green River formation. The Equity Oil Company currently has 17 wells in declining production of oil near Ashley Field and is looking to inject carbon dioxide into the Weber reservoir to increase the rate of oil flow through their pipelines.

At the time of its discovery (2005), the Green River Formation was said to have the world&#x27;s largest fossil fuel deposits in the form of a solid rock resource called oil shale. There is estimated to be between 500 billion and 1.1 trillion barrels (80 and 175 km3) of potentially recoverable oil in the basin, however; this estimated amount of recoverable oil in the form of kerogen is challenged, and in doubt, as currently there is no economically feasible technology to convert rock into a permeable oil. Kerogen is an uncooked form of hydrocarbon that nature did not convert into actual oil.
The cost of converting Green River oil shale into actual oil at the moment would be higher than what it could be sold for. The EROI for oil shale is &quot;very low&quot; while having a very high destructive environmental impact.

The Green River Basin contains the world&#x27;s largest known deposit of trona ore near Green River, Wyoming. Soda ash mining from trona veins 900 and 1600 feet (300 and 500 m) deep is a major industrial activity in the area, employing over 2000 persons at four mines. The mining operation is less expensive for the production of soda ash in the United States than the synthetic Solvay process, which predominates in the rest of the world.

The area has been mined for uranium.

<text>The Green River is a tributary of the Ohio River that rises in Lincoln County in south central Kentucky. Tributaries of the Green River include the Barren River, the Nolin River, the Pond River and the Rough River. The river was named after Nathanael Greene, a general of the American Revolutionary War.

==Route==
The river rises from south of Miracle, Kentucky in central Lincoln County, and follows a meandering path, collecting several smaller streams along its way to its impoundment by a dam at Green River Lake near Campbellsville. It then continues in a westerly direction and is joined by the Little Barren River before entering the Mammoth Cave National Park. At the western end of the park, it receives the tributary Nolin River which exits Nolin River Lake. Then continuing westward it is joined by the Barren River. It then takes a more northwesterly turn as it proceeds through western Kentucky. The river provided cooling water for the TVA&#x27;s now-shutdown Paradise Fossil Plant near Drakesboro, in Muhlenberg County. Near Sebree it provides coolant water for Robert Reed Power Station, a coal fired power plant, before it finally empties into the Ohio River at Spottsville.

==History==
Following the Revolutionary War, many veterans staked claims along the Green River as payment for their military service. The river valley also attracted several vagrants, earning it the dubious nickname Rogue&#x27;s Harbor.

In 1842, the Green River was canalized, with a series of locks and dams being built to create a navigable channel as far inland as Bowling Green, Kentucky. Four locks and dams were constructed on the Green River, and one lock and dam was built on the Barren River, a tributary that passed through Bowling Green.

In 1901, two additional locks and dams were opened on the Green River, which allowed river traffic to Mammoth Cave.

The 1937 Ohio River flood caused Green River to back up, inundating much of McLean County.
In 1941, Mammoth Cave National Park was established, and the two upper locks and dams closed in 1950. In 1965, Lock and Dam #4 at Woodbury that locked both the Green and Barren rivers failed.

In 1969, the United States Army Corps of Engineers impounded a section of the river, forming Green River Lake. The lake is now the primary feature of Green River Lake State Park.

The Southern Cherokee Nation of Kentucky, an unrecognized tribe of persons claiming Cherokee ancestry, is located in Henderson County, near the lower Green River.

==Locks and dams==

The Green River flows through Mammoth Cave National Park, located along river miles 188 to 210. The river drains the cave and controls the master base level of the Mammoth Cave system: the construction of a dam at Brownsville in 1906 raised the water level in some parts of the cave system by as much as above its natural value. The heightened level of Green River probably kept the connection of Mammoth Cave and the nearby Flint Ridge Cave system underwater until a drought partially exposed it and made connection a reality, increasing the length of Mammoth Cave to over 360 miles in length. In 2017, multiple agencies along with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers closed Green River Lock and Dam #6 and dismantled it after a hydraulic hole was discovered in the dam. Green River is now free-flowing throughout Mammoth Cave National Park though water levels are impacted by releases from Green River Lake upstream. This has allowed for increased canoeing and kayaking opportunities from Nolin Dam to Brownsville, and has added more land to the National Park on the west bank of Green River. The 2022 removal of Lock and Dam #5 near Reedyville will allow more opportunities for canoeing and kayaking along the river from Mammoth Cave to Rochester.
The Green River, an important transportation artery for the coal industry, is open to traffic up to the closed Lock and Dam #3 (known as the Rochester Dam) at mile 108.5. In 2019, plans were underway at Lock and Dam #3 to repair the dam and potentially raise the slack water pool held behind it by as much as three feet. Muhlenberg County, once the largest coal-producing county in the nation, benefits greatly from access to the river, as does the aluminium industry in Henderson County. In 2002, more than 10 million short tons were shipped on the river, primarily sub-bituminous coal, petroleum coke, and aluminium ore.

==Biology==
The Green River is home to more than 150 fish species and more than 70 mussel species. This includes some of Kentucky&#x27;s largest fish and some of the world&#x27;s rarest species of mussels.

===Mussels===
Endangered species:
*Ring Pink &quot;Obovaria retusa&quot;
*Rough Pigtoe &quot;Pleurobema plenum&quot;
*Northern riffleshell &quot;Epioblasma torulosa rangiana&quot; 

Threatened species:
*Long solid Mussel &quot;Fusconaia subrotunda&quot;
*Pink Mucket &quot;Lampsilis abrupta&quot;
*Pyramid Pigtoe &quot;Pleurobema rubrum&quot;

==In popular culture==
In summers as a child, singer John Prine would go with his parents to visit family in Muhlenberg County near Paradise, Kentucky. The visits, and seeing the devastation to the area brought by strip mining for coal, inspired his song &quot;Paradise&quot;, which also references the River and the Rochester Dam. In the song, Prine asks to have his ashes dispersed on the Green River. After his death in 2020 from COVID-19, this wish was fulfilled, and in 2022, the John Prine Memorial Park of Rochester Dam was officially opened.

Kotake is located in the northern part of the Chikuho district in central Fukuoka Prefecture, sandwiched between Nogata City and Iizuka City. It is located approximately 40 kilometers northeast of the center of Fukuoka City and approximately 40 kilometers southwest of the center of Kitakyushu City. The Onga River flows north-south through the center of the town. The area around the intersection of Japan National Route 200 and Fukuoka Prefectural Route 74 at the southern end of the town is the central urban area.

===Neighboring municipalities===

The average annual rainfall is 1560 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.7 °C, and lowest in January, at around 4.6 °C.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Kotake is as shown below

==History==
The area of Kotake was part of ancient Chikuzen Province. During the Edo Period, the area was under the control of Fukuoka Domain. After the Meiji restoration, the village of Katsuno was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Katsuno was raised to town status on January 1, 1928, and was renamed Kotake.

==Government==
Kotake has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 12 members. Kotake, collectively with the city of Miyawaka and town of Kurate, contributes one member to the Fukuoka Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of the Fukuoka 8th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
During the Meiji period, Kotake, along with the other municipalities of the Chikuho area, developed with the Kitakyushu industrial zone through coal mining, and is still considered part of to the Greater Kitakyushu Metropolitan Area. However, as the demand for coal decreased due to the energy revolution, the coal mines that had sponsored prosperity have closed, leading to depopulation. The last coal mine closed in 1976. Efforts are being made to revitalize the former sites by reusing them as industrial parks.

==Education==
Kotake has two public elementary schools and one public junior high school by the town government. The town does not have a high school.

<text>Daniel Massey (24 February 1798 – 15 November 1856) was an American-born Canadian blacksmith and businessman in what is now Newcastle, Ontario. A member of the Massey family and a farm machinery pioneer, Massey began production of agricultural implements in 1847 and established what grew into Massey-Ferguson.

==Early life==
Massey was born in Windsor, Vermont in 1798 to Daniel Massey Sr. and Rebecca Kelley. The family relocated to Upper Canada sometime between 1802 and 1807, likely to acquire cheap land, as many Americans were doing at the time. They settled on a farm in Haldimand Township near present-day Grafton. As a child, Massey was sent to live with relatives in Watertown, New York, where he attended school. He returned to Upper Canada by age 14, at which point he took over the family farm while his father and older brothers joined the Upper Canadian Militia to fight in the War of 1812. He had two older brothers, one of whom died in the war, and at least one sister.

Massey was a seventh-generation North American, descended from Puritans from Cheshire, England. Geoffrey Massy arrived in America around 1630, first in Essex, Massachusetts, and later in New Hampshire and Watertown, New York.

==Career==
Massey left home in 1817 at age 19 and spent several years clearing land for farms, which he then sold. In 1830, he settled down in Haldimand to care for his own farm. The same year, he brought a mechanical thresher, &quot;one of the first... if not the very first imported into Upper Canada&quot;, back from a visit to Watertown; this was the start of his work on and fascination with farm implements.

In 1844, Massey&#x27;s son Hart took over the farm, while Massey himself tinkered with repairing implements in a workshop on the property. He sold the farm to Hart in 1847 and moved to the Newcastle area, where he partnered with Richard F. Vaughan, owner of a struggling foundry and blacksmith shop in Bond Head. In 1849, he bought Vaughan&#x27;s share of the company and moved to a larger facility in Newcastle, where he set up the Newcastle Foundry and Machine Manufactory. His son Hart joined the company as a superintendent in 1851, becoming a partner in 1853 and sole owner in 1856 when his father retired.

Though Massey and his business were not prominent during his lifetime, the Newcastle Foundry and Machine Manufactory thrived. In 1870, Massey Manufacturing Company outgrew its Newcastle workshop and moved to Toronto. The firm merged with its main competitor, A. Harris, Son and Company Limited in 1891, at which point it became Massey-Harris, which produced the world&#x27;s first commercially successful self-propelled combine harvester in 1938. Massey-Harris purchased the Ferguson Company in 1953 to form Massey-Harris-Ferguson, which was shortened to Massey-Ferguson in 1958. The company continued to grow and remains a top multinational farm implement manufacturer. The business was headed by Hart and his descendants until 1926.

Massey was inducted into the Ontario Agricultural Hall of Fame in 1981 after being nominated by Massey-Ferguson.

==Personal life==
Massey married his childhood sweetheart Lucina Bradley in 1820. A Methodist family, they had three sons and seven daughters. He died on 15 November 1856 in Newcastle and is buried at Bowmanville Cemetery in Clarington, Ontario.

Lillian Massey Treble was Massey&#x27;s granddaughter. His great-grandchildren included Vincent Massey and Raymond Massey, and his great-great-grandchildren included actors Daniel and Anna Massey, architect Geoffrey Massey, and civil servant Lionel Massey.

The area of Keisen was part of ancient Chikuzen Province. Stone tools from the Japanese Paleolithic and numerous burial mounds from the Kofun period indicate that the area has been inhabited for many thousands of years. It was ruled by the Asakura clan during the Sengoku period. During the Edo Period, the area was under the control of Fukuoka Domain. After the Meiji restoration, the village of Keisen was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Keisen was raised to town status on April 17, 1940.

The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around . The highest temperature ever recorded in Asakura was on 16 July 1994; the coldest temperature ever recorded was on 25 January 2016.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Asakura in 2020 is 50,273 people. Asakura has been conducting censuses since 1920.

==History==
The area of Asakura was part of ancient Chikuzen Province. It is also one of the locations theorized to have been the location of Yamatai, based on the similarity of local place names to those in Yamato Province. According to the Nihon Shoki, after the fall of the Kingdom of Baekje to the combined forces of Tang China and Silla, Empress Saimei relocated the capital of Japan to the Tachibana no Hironiwa Palace in Asakura in 661 AD in preparation for a counter-invasion of the Korean Peninsula; however, he died the same year and the invasion never took place. In 1203, during the Kamakura period, the area was awarded as a &quot;shōen&quot; landed estate to Harada Tanekatsu, who took the name of &quot;Akitsuki&quot; and who began construction of Akizuki Castle. The Akizuki clan would rule the area for 17 generations to the end of the Sengoku period. Following the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, the area became part of the holdings of the Kuroda clan of Fukuoka Domain. Kuroda Nagamasa&#x27;s third son, Kuroda Nagaoki, was assigned 50,000 &quot;koku&quot; of the domain&#x27;s &quot;kokudaka&quot; and allowed to establish Akizuki Domain as a subsidiary domain. The Kuroda continued to rule to the Meiji restoration. In October 1876, the Akizuki rebellion occurred in which former &quot;samurai&quot; of the domain attempted to overthrow the Meiji government. 

With the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889 the town of Amagi; and 18 villages: Akizuki, Asakura, Haki, Hinashiro, Fukuda, Fukunari, Kamiakizuki, Kanagawa, Takagi, Kugumiya, Mada, Masue, Minagi, Miyano, Ōba, Shiwa, Tateishi and Yasukawa were created. Akizuki was elevated to town status on December 27, 1893.

*June 15, 1909 - Fukunari and Ōba were merged to create Daifuku Village.
*April 17, 1939 - Haki was elevated to town status.
*April 1, 1951 - Kugumiya, Masue and Shiwa were merged into Haki Town.
*April 1, 1954 - Amagi, Akizuki, Fukuda, Hinashiro, Kamiakizuki, Kanagawa, Mada, Minagi, Tateishi and Yasukawa were all merged to create Amagi City.
*March 10, 1955 - Takagi was merged into Amagi City.
*March 31, 1955 - Daifuku and Miyano were merged into Asakura Village.
*April 1, 1962 - Asakura was elevated to town status.
*March 20, 2006 - Amagi, Asakura and Haki were merged to create the city of Asakura.

==Government==
Asakura has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 318 members. Asakura, together with the town of Chikuzen and village of Tōhō contributes two members to the Fukuoka Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Fukuoka 5th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

<doc id="479030" wikidata="Q557200" url="?curid=479030" title="Trellis coded modulation">
<text>Trellis coded modulation (TCM) is a modulation scheme that transmits information with high efficiency over band-limited channels such as telephone lines. Gottfried Ungerboeck invented trellis modulation while working for IBM in the 1970s, and first described it in a conference paper in 1976. It went largely unnoticed, however, until he published a new, detailed exposition in 1982 that achieved sudden and widespread recognition.

In the late 1980s, modems operating over plain old telephone service (&quot;POTS&quot;) typically achieved 9.6 kbit/s by employing four bits per symbol QAM modulation at 2,400 baud (symbols/second). This bit rate ceiling existed despite the best efforts of many researchers, and some engineers predicted that without a major upgrade of the public phone infrastructure, the maximum achievable rate for a POTS modem might be 14 kbit/s for two-way communication (3,429 baud × 4 bits/symbol, using QAM).

14 kbit/s is only 40% of the theoretical maximum bit rate predicted by Shannon&#x27;s theorem for POTS lines (approximately 35 kbit/s). Ungerboeck&#x27;s theories demonstrated that there was considerable untapped potential in the system, and by applying the concept to new modem standards, speed rapidly increased to 14.4, 28.8 and ultimately 33.6 kbit/s.

==A new modulation method==
The name &quot;trellis&quot; derives from the fact that a state diagram of the technique closely resembles a trellis lattice. The scheme is basically a convolutional code of rates (&quot;r&quot;, &quot;r&quot;+1). Ungerboeck&#x27;s unique contribution is to apply the parity check for each symbol, instead of the older technique of applying it to the bit stream then modulating the bits. He called the key idea &quot;mapping by set partitions&quot;. This idea groups symbols in a tree-like structure, then separates them into two limbs of equal size. At each &quot;limb&quot; of the tree, the symbols are further apart.

Though hard to visualize in multiple dimensions, a simple one-dimension example illustrates the basic procedure. Suppose the symbols are located at [1, 2, 3, 4, ...]. Place all odd symbols in one group, and all even symbols in the second group. (This is not quite accurate, because Ungerboeck was looking at the two dimensional problem, but the principle is the same.) Take every other symbol in each group and repeat the procedure for each tree limb. He next described a method of assigning the encoded bit stream onto the symbols in a very systematic procedure. Once this procedure was fully described, his next step was to program the algorithms into a computer and let the computer search for the best codes. The results were astonishing. Even the most simple code (4 state) produced error rates nearly one one-thousandth of an equivalent uncoded system. For two years Ungerboeck kept these results private and only conveyed them to close colleagues. Finally, in 1982, Ungerboeck published a paper describing the principles of trellis modulation.

A flurry of research activity ensued, and by 1984 the International Telecommunication Union had published a standard, V.32, for the first trellis-modulated modem at 9.6 kilobit/s (2,400 baud and 4 bits per symbol). Over the next several years further advances in encoding, plus a corresponding symbol rate increase from 2,400 to 3,429 baud, allowed modems to achieve rates up to 34.3 kilobits/s (limited by maximum power regulations to 33.8 kilobits/s). Today, the most common trellis-modulated V.34 modems use a 4-dimensional set partition—achieved by treating two two-dimensional symbols as a single lattice. This set uses 8, 16, or 32 state convolutional codes to squeeze the equivalent of 6 to 10 bits into each symbol the modem sends (for example, 2,400 baud × 8 bits/symbol = 19,200 bit/s).

<text>William Surles McArthur Jr. (born July 26, 1951) is a retired United States Army colonel and NASA astronaut and a veteran of three Space Shuttle missions and one expedition to the International Space Station via the Russian Soyuz capsule.

==Army career and education==
Born July 26, 1951, and raised in Red Springs, North Carolina, McArthur was active in the Boy Scouts of America where he achieved its second highest rank, Life Scout. He attended the United States Military Academy, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Science and Engineering in 1973, and earned his commission in the U.S. Army. After serving with the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, McArthur attended the U.S. Army Aviation School and served tours of duty in Korea and Georgia, where he earned a Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1983.

==NASA career==
In 1987, McArthur attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School and was trained as an experimental test pilot. He was assigned to a post as a flight test engineer at NASA and was selected as an astronaut candidate in 1990. McArthur&#x27;s first spaceflight was in 1993 aboard STS-58. Subsequent missions included STS-74 in 1995 and STS-92 in 2000.

A Master Army Aviator, McArthur has logged over 9,000 flight hours in 41 different aircraft and spacecraft.

McArthur is the recipient of a number of prestigious awards and honors including the Army Distinguished Service Medal, the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal (Oak leaf cluster), the NASA Distinguished Service Medal, the NASA Exceptional Service Medal and the NASA Space Flight Medal. He retired from the U.S. Army in 2001.

McArthur was on board the International Space Station as a member of Expedition 12, having been launched on Soyuz TMA-7. He lived aboard the station from October 3, 2005, until April 8, 2006.

McArthur served as the Director of Safety and Mission Assurance for the Johnson Space Center until his retirement in June of 2017.

===Expedition 12===
In April 2006, McArthur and Expedition 13 flight officer Jeffrey Williams tested a new method of preparing for spacewalks by &quot;camping out&quot; or spending the night in the Quest airlock, the decompression capsule through which astronauts enter and exit space. In the chamber the pressure was reduced from the normal 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi) to 10.2 psi. The more commonly used method of preparing for spacewalks involves breathing pure oxygen for several hours to purge the body of nitrogen and avoid the bends. The &quot;campout&quot; method was intended to shorten that lengthy preparation time. Four hours into their sleep an error tone prompted mission controllers to cut short the activity, though it was still deemed a success.

==Personal life==
McArthur is married to the former Cynthia Kathryn Lovin with two daughters, and enjoys cycling, photography, and working with personal computers. In May 2009 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Strathclyde in recognition of his contribution to space science and engineering, as well as his outreach work with the Scottish Space School. He resides in Friendswood, Texas.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans&quot; is one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It is one of eight stories in the cycle collected as &quot;His Last Bow&quot; (1917), and is the second and final main appearance of Mycroft Holmes. It was originally published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom and in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in the United States in 1908.

Doyle ranked &quot;The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans&quot; fourteenth in a list of his nineteen favourite Sherlock Holmes stories.

==Plot==
The monotony of thick smog-shrouded London is broken by a sudden visit from Holmes&#x27; brother Mycroft. He has come about some missing, secret submarine plans. Seven of the ten missing papers were found with Arthur Cadogan West&#x27;s body, but the three &quot;most essential&quot; papers are still missing. West was a young clerk in a government office at Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, whose body was found next to the Underground tracks near the Aldgate tube station, his head crushed. He had little money with him (although there appears to have been no robbery), theatre tickets, and curiously, no Underground ticket.

Inspector Lestrade tells Holmes that a passenger reported hearing a thud, as though a body had fallen on the track, close to where West&#x27;s body was found. The passenger could not see anything, however, owing to the thick fog. After an examination of the track near Aldgate, Holmes concludes that West had been killed elsewhere, was deposited on the roof of an Underground train, and fell off when the jarring action of going across a railway point at Aldgate shook the coach.

Holmes decides to visit Sir James Walter, who was in charge of the papers. He has, however, died, apparently of a broken heart from the loss of his honour when the papers were stolen, according to his brother Colonel Valentine Walter. On visiting West&#x27;s fiancée, Holmes learns that West had something on his mind for the last week or so of his life; he had commented on how easily a traitor could get hold of &quot;the secret&quot; and how much foreign agents would pay for it. On the night in question, West and his fiancé were on their way to the theatre, when he suddenly dashed off into the fog and did not return.

Holmes next goes to the office from which the plans were stolen. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk, tells Holmes that, as always, he was the last man out of the office that night, and that he had put the papers in the safe. Anyone coming in afterwards to steal them would have needed three keys (for the building, the office, and the safe), but no duplicates were found on West&#x27;s body, and only the late Sir James had all three keys. Johnson also mentions that one of the seven recovered papers includes a unique invention, without which the submarine could not be properly built. Holmes also discovers that it is possible to see what is happening inside the office from outside, as the iron shutters do not close properly.

After leaving, Holmes finds that the clerk at the nearby Underground station remembers seeing West on the evening in question. Deeply shaken by something, he had taken a train to London Bridge.

Acting on information from Mycroft, and on what he has learnt thus far, Holmes identifies a person of interest: Hugo Oberstein, a known foreign agent who left town shortly after West&#x27;s murder. Some small reconnaissance shows Holmes that Oberstein&#x27;s house backs onto an above-ground portion of the Underground line; furthermore, owing to traffic at a nearby junction, trains often stop right under his windows. It seems clear that West&#x27;s body was laid on the train roof just there.

Holmes and Dr. Watson break into Oberstein&#x27;s empty house and examine the windows, finding that the grime has been smudged, and there is a bloodstain. An Underground train stops right under the window. Some messages from the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; agony column, all seeming to allude to a business deal, are also found, posted by &quot;Pierrot&quot;. Holmes posts a similarly cryptic message in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; demanding a meeting, signing it Pierrot, in the hopes that the thief might show up at Oberstein&#x27;s house.


It works. Colonel Valentine Walter shows up and is stunned to find Holmes, Watson, Lestrade, and Mycroft all waiting for him. He confesses to the theft of the plans, but swears that it was Oberstein who killed West. West had followed the Colonel to Oberstein&#x27;s and then intervened, and Oberstein had dealt West a fatal blow to the head. Oberstein then decided, over the Colonel&#x27;s objections, that he had to keep three of the papers, because they could not be copied in a short time. He then got the idea of putting the other seven in West&#x27;s pocket and putting him on a train roof outside his window, reasoning that he would be blamed for the theft when his body was found.

Deep in debt, Colonel Walter had acted out of a need for money. He redeems himself somewhat by agreeing to write to Oberstein, whose address on the Continent he knows, inviting him to come back to England for the fourth, vital page. This ruse also works; Oberstein is imprisoned, and the missing pages of the plans are recovered from his trunk. Colonel Walter dies in prison, not long after starting his sentence. For his efforts, Holmes is given an emerald tie pin by &quot;a certain gracious lady&quot;, implied to be Queen Victoria, as the pin was received at Windsor in the 1890s.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans&quot; was published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in December 1908, and in the US in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 12 December 1908. The story was published with six illustrations by Arthur Twidle in the &quot;Strand&quot;, and with five illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;. The story was included in the short story collection &quot;His Last Bow&quot;, which was published in the UK and the US in October 1917.

==Adaptations==

===Film and television===
A 1922 entry in the Stoll film series was an adaptation of &quot;The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans&quot;. It starred Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson, and featured Lewis Gilbert as Mycroft Holmes and Malcolm Tod as Cadogan West.

The story was adapted by Giles Cooper as an episode of the 1965 BBC television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Douglas Wilmer as Holmes and Nigel Stock as Watson. Only the first of two reels of the 16mm telerecording of the episode exists, although the full soundtrack survives. The episode was one of those remade for the West-German WDR &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; series (1967–1968), which exists in full.

The 1986 television film &quot;The Twentieth Century Approaches&quot;, the fifth instalment of &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson&quot;, features the story.

The story was adapted for a 1988 episode of the television series &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, Edward Hardwicke as Doctor Watson and Charles Gray as Mycroft Holmes. In this version, Inspector Lestrade is replaced by Inspector Bradstreet, who allows Colonel Valentine to go free after assisting with Oberstein&#x27;s capture.

The plot of the Matt Frewer 2001 TV movie &quot;The Royal Scandal&quot; is a combination of &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; and &quot;The Bruce-Partington Plans&quot;.

The story is partially used in the episode &quot;The Great Game&quot; (2010) of the television series &quot;Sherlock&quot;.

===Radio===
The story was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode, which aired on 22 October 1931, featured Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Other productions of the story aired in March 1935, with Louis Hector as Holmes and Lovell as Watson, and October 1936, with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson.

The story was also adapted by Meiser as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; that aired in 1939, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. Additional episodes in the series adapted from the story aired in 1941 and 1943 (both with Rathbone as Holmes and Bruce as Watson) and 1948 (with John Stanley as Holmes and Ian Martin as Watson).

John Gielgud played Sherlock Holmes and Ralph Richardson played Watson in an adaptation of the story that aired on the BBC Light Programme in 1954. John Gielgud&#x27;s brother Val Gielgud played Mycroft Holmes. John Cazabon played Inspector Lestrade, and William Fox played Colonel Valentine Walter. The production aired on NBC radio in 1955.

The story was adapted for the BBC Light Programme in 1967 by Michael Hardwick, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. Felix Felton played Mycroft Holmes.

&quot;The Bruce-Partington Plans&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, featuring Jamie Glover as Cadogan West and Stephen Thorne as Inspector Lestrade.

In 2010, the story was adapted as an episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson, with Rick May as Lestrade.

<doc id="479047" wikidata="Q1205864" url="?curid=479047" title="Tachiarai, Fukuoka">
<text>is a town located in Mii District, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 16,065 in 6283 households, and a population density of 700 persons per km². The total area of the town is . 

==Geography==
Tachiarai is located in southern Fukuoka Prefecture and the northern part of the Chikugo Plain, approximately 15 kilometers northeast of Kurume City and approximately 30 kilometers southeast of Fukuoka City. The topography is flat and the Chikugo River flows through the southeastern part of the town, forming the border with Kurume City. Tachiarai is divided into three neighborhoods: Ozeki, Hongō and Kikuchi. 

===Neighboring municipalities===
Fukuoka Prefecture
*Asakura
*Chikuzen
*Kurume
*Ogōri

===Climate===
Tachiarai has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Tachiarai is 15.2 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1946 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.4 °C, and lowest in January, at around 4.4 °C.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Tachiarai is as shown below

==History==
The area of Tachiarai was part of ancient Chikugo Province and during the Edo Period was part of the holdings of Kurume Domain. The village of Tachiarai was established on May 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. Tachiarai was home to an Imperial Japanese Army Air Force Base, established in 1919 and the Tachiarai Army Flight School, established in 1940, before American bombers destroyed them in 1945. On March 31,1955 Tachiarai merged with the villages of Ōzeki and Hongō and was raised to town status. 

=== Kakure Kirishitan community ===
During the Edo Period (1603-1867), Tachiarai was home to a community of Japanese hidden Christians (&quot;Kakure Kirishitans&quot;) who were present in the area since the 16th century, centered in the village of Imamura. They were one of the very few &quot;Kakure Kirishitan&quot; communities in Kyushu outside present-day Nagasaki prefecture. The community was quite successful in remaining hidden, avoiding being targeted by any crackdowns by the Tokugawa shogunate, which had banned Christianity on pain of death. As with other &quot;Kakure Kirishitan&quot; communities, the so-called &quot;Imamura Christians&quot; had unique practices and beliefs, such as the cult of a saint-like figure called &quot;Joan Mataemon&quot; whose historicity remains uncertain.

In 1867, the community was &quot;discovered&quot; by Christians from Urakami, triggering a process of conversion to Roman Catholicism. This attracted attention from the local authorities as Christianity was still banned in Japan, resulting in a large number of arrests, although all were released by 1868. By 1912, there were 2,712 Catholics in Tachiarai, but those began to emigrate en-masse to Brazil and later to other South American countries. In contrast to its centuries of hiding in Japan, Tachiarai&#x27;s Catholic diaspora was highly active in Brazil, having participated in the foundation of the Colégio São Francisco Xavier in São Paulo, which for decades was the most renowned educational institution for Brazilian nikkeis, and of churches in the cities of Registro and Promissão.

The present-day Brick Gothic Imamura Church was constructed with materials donated from Germany and inaugurated in 1913. In 2006, it was declared as a Tangible Cultural Heritage of Fukuoka prefecture, and in 2015, an Important Cultural Property of Japan.

==Government==
Tachiarai has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 12 members. Tachiarai, collectively with the city of Ogōri, contributes two members to the Fukuoka Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of the Fukuoka 6th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

Tachiarai houses a Defense Intelligence Headquarters signals intelligence facility, which is used to monitor communications from transiting satellites, as part of a program codenamed MALLARD.

== Economy ==
The economy of Tachiarai is based on agriculture. Much of the land is used for growing rice and other crops. A substantial portion of the population commutes to Kurume or Fukuoka for work.

==Education==
Tachiarai has four public elementary high schools and one public junior high school operated by the town government. The town does not have a high school.

<doc id="479051" wikidata="Q452419" url="?curid=479051" title="Collecting duct system">
<text>The collecting duct system of the kidney consists of a series of tubules and ducts that physically connect nephrons to a minor calyx or directly to the renal pelvis. The collecting duct participates in electrolyte and fluid balance through reabsorption and excretion, processes regulated by the hormones aldosterone and vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone).

There are several components of the collecting duct system, including the connecting tubules, cortical collecting ducts, and medullary collecting ducts.

==Structure==
===Segments===

The segments of the system are as follows:

====Connecting tubule====
With respect to the renal corpuscle, the connecting tubule (CNT, or junctional tubule, or arcuate renal tubule) is the most proximal part of the collecting duct system. It is adjacent to the distal convoluted tubule, the most distal segment of the renal tubule. Connecting tubules from several adjacent nephrons merge to form cortical collecting tubules, and these may join to form cortical collecting ducts (CCD). Connecting tubules of some juxtamedullary nephrons may arch upward, forming an arcade. It is this &quot;arcuate&quot; feature which gives the tubule its alternate name.

The connecting tubule derives from the metanephric blastema, but the rest of the system derives from the ureteric bud. Because of this, some sources group the connecting tubule as part of the nephron, rather than grouping it with the collecting duct system.
The initial collecting tubule is a segment with a constitution similar as the collecting duct, but before the convergence with other tubules.
The &quot;cortical collecting ducts&quot; receive filtrate from multiple initial collecting tubules and descend into the renal medulla to form medullary collecting ducts.

It participates in the regulation of water and electrolytes, including sodium, and chloride. The CNT is sensitive to both isoprotenerol (more so than the cortical collecting ducts) and antidiuretic hormone (less so than the cortical collecting ducts), the latter largely determining its function in water reabsorption.

====Medullary collecting duct==== 
&quot;Medullary collecting ducts&quot; are divided into outer and inner segments, the latter reaching more deeply into the medulla. The variable reabsorption of water and, depending on fluid balances and hormonal influences, the reabsorption or secretion of sodium, potassium, hydrogen and bicarbonate ion continues here. Urea passively transports out of duct here and creates 500mOsm gradient.
The outer segment of the medullary collecting duct follows the cortical collecting duct. It reaches the level of the renal medulla where the thin descending limb of loop of Henle borders with the thick ascending limb of loop of Henle
The inner segment is the part of the collecting duct system between the outer segment and the papillary ducts.

====Papillary duct====
Papillary (collecting) ducts are anatomical structures of the kidneys, previously known as the ducts of Bellini. Papillary ducts represent the most distal portion of the collecting duct. They receive renal filtrate (precursor to urine) from several medullary collecting ducts and empty into a minor calyx. Papillary ducts continue the work of water reabsorption and electrolyte balance initiated in the collecting tubules.

Medullary collecting ducts converge to form a central (papillary) duct near the apex of each renal pyramid. This &quot;papillary duct&quot; exits the renal pyramid at the renal papillae. The renal filtrate it carries drains into a minor calyx as urine.

The cells that comprise the duct itself are similar to rest of the collecting system. The duct is lined by a layer of simple columnar epithelium resting on a thin basement membrane. The epithelium is composed primarily of principal cells and α-intercalated cells. The simple columnar epithelium of the collecting duct system transitions into urothelium near the junction of a papillary duct and a minor calyx.

These cells work in tandem to reabsorb water, sodium, and urea and secrete acid and potassium. The amount of reabsorption or secretion that occurs is related to needs of the body at any given time. These processes are mediated by hormones (aldosterone, vasopressin) and the osmolarity (concentration of electrically charged chemicals) of the surrounding medulla. Hormones regulate how permeable the papillary duct is to water and electrolytes. In the medullary collecting duct specifically, vasopressin upregulates urea transporter A1. This increases the concentration of urea in the surrounding interstitium and increases the osmolarity.
Osmolarity influences the strength of the force that pulls (reabsorbs) water from the papillary duct into the medullary interstitium. This is especially important in the papillary ducts. Osmolarity increases from the base of the renal pyramid to the apex. It is highest at the renal apex (up to 1200 mOsm). Thus the force driving the reabsorption of water from the collecting system is the greatest in the papillary duct.

===Cells===
Each component of the collecting duct system contains two cell types, intercalated cells and a segment-specific cell type:
* For the connecting tubules, this specific cell type is the connecting tubule cell
* For the collecting ducts, it is the principal cell. The inner medullary collecting ducts contain an additional cell type, called the inner medullary collecting duct cell.

====Principal cells====
The principal cell mediates the collecting duct&#x27;s influence on sodium and potassium balance via sodium channels and potassium channels located on the cell&#x27;s apical membrane. Aldosterone determines expression of sodium channels (especially the ENaC on the collecting tubule). Increases in aldosterone increase expression of luminal sodium channels. Aldosterone also increases the number of Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase pumps that allow increased sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. Vasopressin determines the expression of aquaporin channels that provide a physical pathway for water to pass through the principal cells. Together, aldosterone and vasopressin let the principal cell control the quantity of water that is reabsorbed.

====Intercalated cells====
Intercalated cells come in α, β, and non-α non-β varieties and participate in acid–base homeostasis.

For their contribution to acid–base homeostasis, the intercalated cells play important roles in the kidney&#x27;s response to acidosis and alkalosis. Damage to the α-intercalated cell&#x27;s ability to secrete acid can result in distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA type I, classical RTA)(reference). The intercalated cell population is also extensively modified in response to chronic lithium treatment, including the addition of a largely uncharacterized cell type which expressed markers for both intercalated and principal cells.

==Function==

The collecting duct system is the final component of the kidney to influence the body&#x27;s electrolyte and fluid balance. In humans, the system accounts for 4–5% of the kidney&#x27;s reabsorption of sodium and 5% of the kidney&#x27;s reabsorption of water. At times of extreme dehydration, over 24% of the filtered water may be reabsorbed in the collecting duct system.

The wide variation in water reabsorption levels for the collecting duct system reflects its dependence on hormonal activation. The collecting ducts, in particular, the outer medullary and cortical collecting ducts, are largely impermeable to water without the presence of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, or vasopressin).
* In the &quot;absence&quot; of ADH, water in the renal filtrate is left alone to enter the urine, promoting diuresis.
* When ADH is &quot;present&quot;, aquaporins allow for the reabsorption of this water, thereby inhibiting diuresis.

The collecting duct system participates in the regulation of other electrolytes, including chloride, potassium, hydrogen ions, and bicarbonate.

An extracellular protein called hensin (protein) mediates the regulation of secretion of acid by alpha cells in acidosis, and secretion of bicarbonate by beta cells in alkalosis.

==Collecting duct carcinoma==

Carcinoma of the collecting duct is a relatively rare subtype of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), accounting for less than 1% of all RCCs. Many reported cases have occurred in younger patients, often in the third, fourth, or fifth decade of life. Collecting duct carcinomas are derived from the medulla, but many are infiltrative, and extension into the cortex is common. 
Most reported cases have been high grade and advanced stage and have not responded to conventional therapies. 
Most patients are symptomatic at presentation. Immunohistochemical and molecular analyses suggest that collecting duct RCC may resemble transitional cell carcinoma, and some patients with advanced collecting duct RCC have responded to cisplatin- or gemcitabine-based chemotherapy.

<text>Marsha Sue Ivins (born April 15, 1951) is an American retired astronaut and a veteran of five Space Shuttle missions.

==Career==
Ivins, born April 15, 1951, in Baltimore, Maryland, graduated from Nether Providence High School in Wallingford, Pennsylvania in 1969, and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1973. She is Jewish-American. She went to work for NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center, and worked mainly on orbiter displays and controls, before being assigned as a flight engineer in 1980 and co-pilot on NASA administrative aircraft. In 1984, Ivins was selected as an astronaut candidate.

She has flown aboard five space missions: STS-32 (1990), STS-46 (1992), STS-62 (1994), STS-81 (1997), and STS-98 (2001). Ivins retired from NASA on December 31, 2010.

==Spaceflight experience==

STS-32 (January 9–20, 1990) launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on an eleven-day flight, during which crew members on board the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; successfully deployed a Syncom satellite, and retrieved the 21,400-pound Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF). Mission duration was 261 hours, 1 minute, and 38 seconds. Following 173 orbits of the Earth and 4.5 million miles, &quot;Columbia&quot; returned with a night landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California.

STS-46 (July 31 – August 8, 1992) was an 8-day mission, during which crew members deployed the EURECA (European Retrievable Carrier) satellite, and conducted the first Tethered Satellite System (TSS) test flight. Mission duration was 191 hours, 16 minutes, and 7 seconds. Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; and her crew launched and landed at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, completing 126 orbits of the Earth in 3.35 million miles.

STS-62 (March 4–18, 1994) was a 14-day mission for the United States Microgravity Payload (USMP) 2 and Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology (OAST) 2 payloads. These payloads studied the effects of microgravity on materials sciences and other space flight technologies. Other experiments on board included demonstration of advanced teleoperator tasks using the remote manipulator system, protein crystal growth, and dynamic behavior of space structures. Mission duration was 312 hours, 23 minutes, and 16 seconds. Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; launched and landed at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, completing 224 orbits in 5.82 million miles.

STS-81 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (January 12–22, 1997) was a 10-day mission, the fifth to dock with Russia&#x27;s Space Station Mir, and the second to exchange U.S. astronauts. The mission also carried the Spacehab double module providing additional middeck locker space for secondary experiments. In five days of docked operations more than three tons of food, water, experiment equipment and samples were moved back and forth between the two spacecraft. Following 160 orbits of the Earth, the STS-81 mission concluded with a landing on Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s Runway 33 ending a 3.9 million mile journey. Mission duration was 244 hours, 56 minutes.

STS-98 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (February 7–20, 2001) continued the task of building and enhancing the International Space Station by delivering the U.S. laboratory module Destiny. The Shuttle spent seven days docked to the station while Destiny was attached and three spacewalks were conducted to complete its assembly. The crew also relocated a docking port, and delivered supplies and equipment to the resident Expedition-1 crew. Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California traveling 5.3 million miles in 203 orbits. Mission duration was 12 days, 21 hours, 20 minutes.

In 2006, the Setaka Town Assembly proposed inviting universities to consider establishing a campus in the town and asked for comments from the town&#x27;s residents. One group of residents submitted a deposition asking that only universities that &quot;did not&quot; allow foreign student enrollment be allowed to open a campus in Setaka. The deposition was accepted by the town assembly without debate.

<text>Overkill is the use of excessive force or action that goes further than what is necessary to achieve its goal. It may be a literal term referring to physical damage, though it is also used in colloquial conversation as a metaphor.

==Nuclear weapons==
&quot;Overkill&quot; is especially used to refer to a destructive nuclear capacity exceeding the amount needed to destroy an enemy.

The term is attested from 1946 and was in common use during the Cold War era, referring to the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. Both nations possess more than enough nuclear weapons to destroy one another many times over – nuclear overkill.
The term for this was &quot;pounding the rubble&quot; or, as military officers sometimes joked, &quot;pounding the ruble&quot;. Overkill colloquially refers either to use of force or weapons or to satiate the desire to humiliate a rival. In Spanish, &quot;overkill&quot; is referred to as &quot;matanza excesiva&quot;.

==In video games==
Overkill is a common feature implemented in many video games, typically representing the fact that the damage a single attack inflicted on an enemy or player character far exceeded the character&#x27;s remaining health points. In many first-person shooters, starting with &quot;Doom&quot;, overkilling a character results in &quot;gibbing&quot; – the character exploding in a shower of .

<text>was a town located in Tagawa District, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. It was once a coal mining town.

As of 2005, the town had an estimated population of 9,592 and a density of 592.09 persons per km2. The total area was 16.20 km2. This is down from 9,870 (609.26/km2) in 2003.

On March 6, 2006, Akaike was merged with the towns of Hōjō and Kanada (all from Tagawa District) to create the town of Fukuchi, with an estimated population of 25,000 (September 1, 2011).

In 1992, it was the first municipality in Japan to become effectively bankrupt, with losses of 3.2 billion yen, or 1.3 times its annual budget. The town&#x27;s rehabilitation process was completed at the end of fiscal 2001—two years earlier than initially planned. This was achieved through measures such as slashing the salaries of town officials, raising utility costs, and cutting back on public works projects.

In 1983 Clervoy was seconded from the Direction générale de l&#x27;armement (DGA) to CNES (French Space Agency) where he works on autopilot systems for various projects such as the earth observation satellite SPOT, the optical inter-satellite space link STAR, or the comet probe VEGA. Clervoy is Ingénieur Général de l&#x27;Armement in the Corps of Armament at the DGA.

He was selected in the second group of French astronauts in 1985 and started intensive Russian language training. From 1987 until 1992 he directed the parabolic flight program at the Flight Test Center, Brétigny-sur-Orge and provided technical support to the European human space program within the ESA Hermes crew office in Toulouse. From 1983 to 1987, Clervoy was also a lecturer in signal processing and general mechanics at the École nationale supérieure de l&#x27;aéronautique et de l&#x27;espace, Toulouse.

In 1991, he trained in Star City, Moscow, on the Soyuz and Mir systems. In 1992, he joined the Astronaut Corps of the European Space Agency (ESA) at the European Astronaut Center EAC in Cologne. In August 1992 Clervoy was detached to the NASA Johnson Space Center/ Houston to gain the Space Shuttle mission specialist qualifications. In between his space flights, Clervoy was assigned as flight software verification lead in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL) and as robotics display design lead for Shuttle and ISS. After his third spaceflight, he was assigned as the International Space Station display integration lead in the NASA-JSC Astronaut Office.

He flew twice aboard and once aboard or a total of 675 hours in space. Due to the difficulty that American astronauts had in pronouncing his name, Clervoy was nicknamed &quot;Billy Bob.&quot;

From 2001 through 2008, he was assigned Senior Advisor Astronaut of the Automated Transfer Vehicle ESA project in Les Mureaux (France). In 2008, he was also appointed member of the selection board for the new ESA astronaut class.

Clervoy holds military and civilian parachuting licenses, military and civilian scuba-diving licenses, and private pilot license.

==Spaceflight experience==
* STS-66 (November 3 –14, 1994), the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science-3 (ATLAS-3) mission was part of an ongoing program to determine the Earth&#x27;s energy balance and atmospheric change over an eleven-year solar cycle. Clervoy used the robotic arm to deploy the CRISTA-SPAS atmospheric research satellite 20 hours after lift-off, and logged 262 hours and 34 minutes in space and 175 earth orbits.
* STS-84 (May 15 – 24, 1997) was NASA&#x27;s sixth Shuttle mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station Mir. Assigned as payload commander, Clervoy&#x27;s primary tasks were the management of more than 20 experiments, the operation of the docking system and the double module SPACEHAB, and the transfer of 4 tons of equipment between &quot;Atlantis&quot; and Mir. He was also trained as a contingency spacewalker on this mission. He logged 221 hours and 20 minutes in space and 144 earth orbits. 
* STS-103 (December 19 – 27, 1999) primary objectives was the repair of the Hubble space telescope, which was put to sleep after successive failures of its gyroscopes, necessary to meet the telescope&#x27;s very precise pointing requirements. Clervoy was the flight engineer for ascent, space rendezvous and entry. He used the robotic arm to capture and deploy the telescope, and to maneuver his crew mates during each of their three spacewalks each lasting more than eight hours. He logged 191 hours and 11 minutes in space and 120 Earth orbits.

== Current assignment ==
Clervoy is a member of ESA’s European Astronaut Corps, based at the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, Germany. As part of his ESA collateral duties, Clervoy provides support to the human spaceflight programme, the external relations department and the sustainable development office.

<doc id="479098" wikidata="Q461887" url="?curid=479098" title="Takao Doi">
<text>is a Japanese astronaut, engineer and veteran of two NASA Space Shuttle missions.

== Early life and education ==
Doi holds a doctorate from the University of Tokyo in aerospace engineering, and has studied and published in the fields of propulsion systems and microgravity technology. He researched at the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science and was selected by NASDA as an astronaut candidate in 1985 for the Japanese crewed space program while also conducting research in the United States at NASA&#x27;s Lewis Research Center and the University of Colorado at Boulder. Doi flew as a mission specialist aboard STS-87 in 1997, during which he became the first Japanese astronaut to conduct a spacewalk.

He received a Ph.D. in 1983 from the University of Tokyo, and also a PhD in Astronomy from Rice University in 2004.

== Astronaut career ==
Takao Doi visited the International Space Station in March 2008 as a member of the STS-123 crew. STS-123 delivered the first module of the Japanese laboratory, Kibō, and the Canadian Dextre robot to the space station. During this mission, he became the first person to throw a boomerang in space that had been specifically designed for use in microgravity during spaceflight.

== Post-astronaut career ==
In September 2009, Doi retired from astronaut duty and started working as the chief of Space Applications Section of United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs.

In April 2016, he became a professor at the Unit of Synergetic Studies for Space of Kyoto University and then at the Graduate School of Advanced Integrated Studies in Human Survivability (GSAIS) in April 2020.

As an avid amateur astronomer, he discovered supernovae SN 2002gw and SN 2007aa.

<text>Joseph Frank Fontana (born January 13, 1950) is an Italian-born Canadian politician. He was a Liberal member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1987 to 2006, and mayor of London, Ontario from 2010 until his 2014 convictions for fraud and forgery.

==Life and career==

Fontana was born in Cellara, Cosenza, Italy in 1950, and moved to Canada with his parents at the age of four.

He studied chemical engineering at the University of Waterloo, but left school after becoming the drummer in a rock band. He later moved to London and briefly returned to school at the University of Western Ontario, but left to work in real estate and the insurance industry.

He opposed the building of a federal prison in London and soon became involved in local politics. In 1976 he ran for city council, representing Ward 3, but lost; in 1978 he also lost the Liberal nomination for the federal riding of London-Middlesex, but was elected to London City Council later in the year and served there until 1988, sitting on London&#x27;s Board of Control from 1985 to 1988.

==As Member of Parliament==

In 1988 he was elected to the House of Commons as a member of the opposition and served as Critic for Urban Affairs and Housing. He also formed the band &quot;True Grit&quot; with several Liberals including Roger Gallaway and future prime minister Jean Chrétien (who played trombone). He became the Ontario chair of the Liberal caucus and was involved in the Task Force on Via Rail and the Task Force on the Economy and Recession. In 1990 he supported Paul Martin&#x27;s attempt to become leader of the Liberal Party.

He was re-elected in 1993 and became parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Transport, playing a key role in, among other things, the introduction of the National Airports Policy. From 1996 to 1999 he served a record three times as chair of the national Liberal caucus and in 1999 became chair of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration and the chair of the Southwestern Ontario Liberal caucus.

He served as Minister of Labour in Paul Martin&#x27;s minority government until February 6, 2006, when Stephen Harper was sworn in as Prime Minister.

He was re-elected in 1997, 2000, 2004, and 2006. Appointed as the critic for Science and Research within the Liberal shadow cabinet, Mr. Fontana was strongly speculated to be considering a run for leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, though he ultimately did not seek the post, supporting Gerard Kennedy instead.

==Election as mayor==

On September 8, 2006, Fontana announced that he would run for mayor in London against mayor Anne Marie DeCicco-Best. On September 20, 2006, Fontana formally resigned his seat in the House of Commons in order to run for mayor. He was unsuccessful, losing badly to Mayor DeCicco-Best.

He subsequently announced he would run in the 2010 London mayoral election, again against DeCicco-Best. Fontana won the mayoralty in that election.

As a member of the Privy Council of Canada, Fontana automatically received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012.

==Criminal convictions==

In October 2012, calls for Fontana&#x27;s resignation as mayor were made amid allegations of misuse of government funds used to pay for his son&#x27;s wedding. Some city councillors urged Fontana to step aside during the investigation.

On November 21, 2012, the London detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police issued a press release announcing that Fontana had been charged with breach of trust by a public officer; fraud under $5,000; and uttering forged documents.

On November 22, 2012, Fontana offered to resign from the London Police Services Board and his resignation was formally accepted. Under municipal law governing Ontario, Police Services cannot allow an individual who is under investigation for a criminal offences to take part in any police function. At the next meeting of council&#x27;s Finance and Administrative Services Committee, its councillors asked that Fontanta step aside, voting by a 3–1 vote margin that he resign his council seat and duties as mayor, however the committee decision was not binding under the Municipal Act. A council motion asking Fontana to leave office pending resolution of his criminal charges lost by a vote, 8–5.

Fontana was found guilty of the charges by the Ontario Superior Court on June 13, 2014, and sentenced to serve 4 months under house arrest and 18 months on probation.

On June 16, 2014, Fontana announced he would be stepping down as mayor of London. He formally resigned on June 19, and was temporarily succeeded by Ward 3 city councillor Joe Swan as acting mayor until a council vote the following week selected Joni Baechler as his formal successor until the 2014 municipal election.

<text>Umberto Guidoni (born 18 August 1954 in Rome) is an Italian astrophysicist, science writer and a former ESA astronaut, being the first European to visit the International Space Station. He is a veteran of two NASA Space Shuttle missions. He was also a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 2004 to 2009, with the Group of the European United Left (GUE/NGL).

==Biography==

===Career and spaceflights===

Guidoni earned a doctorate in astrophysics from the University of Rome &quot;La Sapienza&quot; in 1978 and worked in the Italian Space Agency (ASI) as well as in the European Space Agency (ESA). One of his research projects was the Tethered Satellite System, which was part of the payload of the STS-46 mission. Guidoni trained as an alternate payload specialist for that mission and made his first spaceflight aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; STS-75 in 1996, which included the second flight of the TSS system (TSS-1R).

In 2001, Guidoni participated in the Space Shuttle&#x27;s STS-100 mission, being the first European on board International Space Station (ISS).
On that flight, the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; carried the &quot;Raffaello&quot; Multi-Purpose Logistics Module for its maiden flight as well as the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS), the Canadian robotic arm used extensively to assemble the ISS.

===ESA career===

In September 2001, Guidoni was assigned to ESA&#x27;s European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) as crew support for the payloads to be developed for the Columbus Laboratory. &quot;Columbus&quot; and its payloads are the European contribution to the scientific research performed on board the International Space Station.
He retired from active astronaut status in June 2004.

===Member of the European Parliament===

In June 2004 Guidoni was elected to the European Parliament, in the Group of the European United Left (GUE/NGL). He was a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), and substitute of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI), and the Temporary Committee on Climate Change. He has been rapporteur for the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) for Research and Innovation. He also proposed the amendment 16 to protect the freedom of the press from the strict application of the EU directive (IPRED2) on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights.

Guidoni joined the Party of Italian Communists (PdCI) around 2004. He led a tendency within PdCI called &#x27;Unite the Left&#x27;. Guidoni left PdCI in 2009.

===Present activity===


In 2007 was the speaker of the radio program entitled “From the Sputnik to the Shuttle” (the series &quot;At 8 in the evening&quot; by Radio Rai 2), in which he retraced the main steps of the Space Era. In 2009, he presented another cycle of the same series where he narrated the epic history of the Apollo lunar missions. Starting from this program, in 2011, was published the book “From the Earth to the Moon”.

Guidoni is involved in popularizing science and organizes events related to space. He has written articles and books including books for children such as &quot;Martino on Mars&quot;, &quot;Astrolibro&quot; and the most recent published in 2019: &quot;Voglio la LUNA&quot; and &quot;Guida per Giovani Astronauti&quot;.

== Honours ==

 On 15 April 1996, Guidoni was appointed Commander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic by Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, President of Italy.

 On 11 May 2001, he was promoted to Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic by Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, President of Italy.

 For his first orbital flight (STS-75) in 1996, Guidoni also received the NASA Space Flight Medal

 A second &quot;Space Flight Medal&quot; was awarded after his second space flight of 2001 (STS-100).

 For his achievements in space, Guidoni received the NASA Exceptional Service Medal in 2002.

<text>Mamoru &quot;Mark&quot; Mohri, (; born 29 January 1948) is a Japanese scientist, a former NASDA astronaut, and a veteran of two NASA Space Shuttle missions. He is the first Japanese astronaut who was part of an official Japanese space program. The first Japanese person in space, Toyohiro Akiyama, was a journalist who was trained in the Soviet Union.

==Biography==
Born in Yoichi, Hokkaidō, Japan, Mohri earned both a BSc and MSc degree in chemistry from Hokkaido University in respectively 1970 and 1972, and a PhD degree in chemistry from Flinders University in Adelaide, South Australia, in 1976.

Most of Mohri&#x27;s work has been in the field of materials and vacuum sciences. From 1975 to 1985, Mohri was a member of the nuclear engineering faculty of Hokkaido University, where he worked on nuclear fusion-related projects.

==Astronaut career==
Mohri was selected by the National Space Development Agency of Japan (now JAXA) to train as a payload specialist for a Japanese materials science payload. He flew his first space mission aboard STS-47 in 1992 as chief payload specialist for Spacelab-J. Mohri subsequently made another trip into space as part of mission STS-99 in 2000.

As of 2001, Mohri is the Chief Executive Director Emeritus for the Miraikan, the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Tokyo.

==Honours==
On 16 March 2006 Mohri was appointed an Honorary Member of the Order of Australia (AM), “for service to Australia-Japan education and science relations.”
