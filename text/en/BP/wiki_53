<text>Sha Tau Kok () is a closed town in North District, Hong Kong. It is the last remaining major settlement in the Frontier Closed Area and is Hong Kong&#x27;s northernmost town. Its residents are mostly descendants of Hakka farmers and Hoklo fishers who settled the area as a consequence of the Qing dynasty&#x27;s &quot;Great Clearance&quot; in the 17th century.

The town can be accessed via Sha Tau Kok Road and public transit beginning in Sheung Shui. However, visitors who do not possess a valid Closed Area Permit and identification are turned away at the police checkpoint guarding the entrance to the town. There are additional restrictions on access to Chung Ying Street, which separates the Hong Kong portion of Sha Tau Kok from the mainland Chinese portion in Shenzhen (Shatoujiao Subdistrict). Although the Hong Kong government now promotes tourism in the historically isolated town, Chung Ying Street remains closed off to most outsiders, including Hongkongers.

== Etymology ==
The English name Sha Tau Kok is transliterated from the Cantonese pronounciation of the Chinese name , which first appeared in the genealogy of the Ng () Hakka clan of Sha Lan Ha () in 1863. The Ngs of Sha Lan Ha wrote that Sha Tau Kok was originally the name of the bay. Italian Catholic missionary Simeone Volonteri labelled the northwestern part of Mirs Bay as Sha Tau Kok in his 1866 map of Sun On District. &quot;Sathewkok&quot;a transliteration from Hakka Chineseis sometimes used in English works relating to the Hakka people.

According to local legend, the name Sha Tau Kok is derived from a poem written by Qing officials when they inspected the area: &quot;The sun rises from the beach (Sha Tau), the moon hangs above the cape (Kok)&quot; (). The poem is written in red traditional Chinese characters on a stone tablet at the Cape of Sha Tau Kok, the town&#x27;s easternmost point.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
Stone tools such as hammers, pounders, axes, and adzes dating to the Neolithic Period were excavated from San Tsuen, Sha Tau Kok, in 2001. Pottery dating to the Han dynasty was also found there.

=== 17th–18th century ===
Not much is known about settlements in the area before the Qing dynasty (1644–1912). The provincial imperial government expressed interest in the Mirs Bay area because of its salt flats and pearl beds, in the 5th century and 8th century, respectively.

The &quot;Great Clearance&quot; of the 17th century expelled most of the area&#x27;s original settlers, who immigrated to locations such as present-day Yuen Long and Shenzhen. At the same time, the first Hakka settlers of Sha Tau Kok arrived to settle the northern shoreline of Mirs Bay, with more Hakka villages being established in the 18th century.

=== 19th century ===
The Sam Heung village alliance () occupied the original shoreline of Sha Tau Kok, which was called Tai Tan Tung (). The three villages included Shan Tsui, Tong To, and Tam Shui Hang.

During the early 1800s, five wealthy villagesShan Tsui, Tam Shui Hang, Wo Hang, Nam Chung, and Luk Kenginvested in the reclamation of Sha Tau Kok to provide more farmland for the growing population.

Around the 1830s, leaders from 10 or so villages formed an alliance called the Shap Yeuk () to establish a new market at the newly reclaimed Sha Lan Ha, that would allow the Sha Tau Kok area to operate independently from older markets in Shenzhen. The market was later named Tung Wo Market () and described in 1848 by Basel missionary Theodore Hamberg as &quot;a great market, quite given over to trade, newly built, and bustling with business&quot;. In the 1850s there were approximately 50 shops.

As a result of the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory, Sha Tau Kok was leased to the British in 1898. Within the lease, Tung Wo Market was not included, leading to the problem of shopkeepers in Tung Wo being cut off from their ancestral villages in Hong Kong. On 19 April 1899, the elders of Shap Yeuk petitioned the district magistrate and begged that the lease not go forward, fearing excessive taxation and practical problems if they lived in British territory while their market was in Chinese territory. This petition failed to change the lease, leading to a host of problems in the 20th century which led to the decline of Tung Wo Market.

=== 20th century ===
At the time of the 1911 government census, the population of Sha Tau Kok District was 8,570, while the population of Sha Tau Kok Village (British territory) was 14. The population was mostly Hakka, with a small minority of Punti and Hoklo. At the time, the present-day area of Sha Tau Kok Chuen and Yim Liu Ha was covered with marshes and salt fields. A sizable Hoklo population worked at those salt fields; they were the largest community of Hoklo speakers in the North District.

The total population of Sha Tau Kok District was 8,357 in 1921, growing to 8,941 in 1931. During the 1920s, there were around a hundred shops in Tung Wo Market, with some moving across the border to San Lau Street.

On 8 July 1967, amid the 1967 Hong Kong riots, several hundred demonstrators from the People&#x27;s Republic of China (Mainland China), including members of the People&#x27;s Militia, crossed the border at Sha Tau Kok and attacked the police post there. The police attempted to disperse the crowd using tear gas and wooden bullets. They then came under fire from several points, including automatic fire from Chinese territory, prompting an exchange of gunfire. Five police officers were killed and eleven were injured. Gunfire stopped with the arrival of a battalion from the British garrison.

=== 21st century ===
On 27 January 2005, it was announced that street maps would be put up to assist tourists.

In 2022, a pilot scheme was announced, under which limited areas of the town would be opened to tourists. In July 2023, it was announced that the government was working on a feasibility study to redevelop the border control point between Sha Tau Kok and mainland China.

, a daily quota of 1,000 individual visitors (700 group visitors and 300 individual travellers) are permitted to visit Sha Tau Kok, as long as they have a Tourism Closed Area Permit. Individual travellers are only allowed to enter the area by public transport. Although tourists can visit most parts of Sha Tau Kok, Chung Ying Street remains off limits. Although some residents are supportive of the opening up, the move has also led to concern from some residents that tourists might affect the historically closed community.

== Geography ==
Located within the Mirs Bay area, Sha Tau Kok is located on the northern shoreline of Starling Inlet, 10 km northeast of Fanling. The town centre is by the sea and the northern part of the town encompasses the hill known as Yuen Tuen Shan ().

The Cape of Sha Tau Kok () is the easternmost point of Sha Tau Kok. It is the location of a sign and stone stone tablet; the sign displays the cape&#x27;s coordinates, while the Chinese text on the tablet is a poem which translates to &quot;The sun rises from the beach (Sha Tau), the moon hangs above the cape (Kok)&quot; ().

A section of Starling Inlet located offshore of Sha Tau Kok is one of the 26 designated marine fish culture zones in Hong Kong.

== Border with mainland China ==

Sha Tau Kok Control Point is one of Hong Kong&#x27;s border crossing points along the geographical land border between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. The others are Man Kam To Control Point, Lo Wu Control Point, Lok Ma Chau Control Point, Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point, Heung Yuen Wai Control Point and Shenzhen Bay Control Point.

Sha Tau Kok is bordered by the Shatoujiao Subdistrict of Shenzhen; is the pinyin romanisation of , while is the Hong Kong Government Cantonese Romanisation. A border wall separates what was formerly one town, with Chung Ying Street being the only unwalled section of the Sha Tau Kok–Shatoujiao border. Before the implementation of the &quot;open door&quot; policy in the 1980s, both sides exercised strict control over cross-boundary activities on the street. Even in the present day, non-residents must have a permit to visit Chung Ying Street.

After the &quot;open door&quot; policy was put in place to allow freer travel between the two sides, mainland Chinese travelers flocked to Chung Ying Street to purchase goods unavailable in mainland China for personal use. However, it simultaneously became a notorious point of goods trafficking, attracting businessmen and unemployed individuals looking to capitalize on the market opportunities created by the policy. Hawking and touting, smuggling, unlawful import and export of goods, and illegal employment became prominent on Chung Ying Street.

Traffickers would enter Chung Ying Street with visitor permits, some making several trips a day acquiring goods and abusing the custom tariff limits on goods such as baby formula, soaps, electronics, and fabrics. These traffickers would then unload their burden to collect their pay inside Shatoujiao, or sell further inland in the mainland for greater profits. Although there are a lot of goods leaving Hong Kong from Sha Tau Kok via Chung Ying Street, there is also an inflow of foodstuffs and other commodities that come through from China into Hong Kong throughout the day, only limited by the closure of the Chinese customs post.

A variety of items have been smuggled through the border. In 1996, 2,511 kilograms of raw uninspected meat was seized in a single case. In 1997, counterfeit trademarked clothes and imported garments without license valued at over $4.5 million were seized. Live chickens, pirated CDs, animal products of protected species as pangolins, owls, eagles and tigers have also been seized. Attempted drugs trafficking is common to the present day, with cocaine, methamphetamine, and cannabis being intercepted at the Sha Tau Kok border. Illegally imported pet animals such as cats and dogs, are also common.

The control point of access to Shenzhen is located northwest of the hill in Shan Tsui (). It is possible to travel into Shatoujiao on the China side, via the Sha Tau Kok border. A dedicated coach line, the Sha Tau Kok express (), runs at a regular schedule from Sheung Shui MTR station, Fan Ling MTR station, Kowloon Tong, and Yau Ma Tei. Travellers are taken through the Shek Chung Au () border checkpoint without a permit search, then head directly to the Sha Tau Kok Control Point.

Here, passengers disembark, go through customs, and have their documents processed, before reboarding the coach to be driven to the mainland border immigration checkpoint. There, they disembark and take all their belongings through the mainland Chinese customs and again have their documents processed. Travellers from outside China are advised to obtain entry visas from the appropriate authorities, or via a travel agent before attempting the entry. Hong Kong residents of Chinese nationality should hold Home Return Permits for entry into China.

== Public housing ==
Sha Tau Kok Chuen is a public housing estate within the Sha Tau Kok Closed Area built to accommodate the residents affected by the clearance of the area. It consists of 51 low-rise blocks completed in 1988, 1989 and 1991, and it is the public housing estate with the most number of blocks in Hong Kong.

== Demographics ==
Most residents are from Hakka-farming or Hoklo (Hokkien)-fishing backgrounds. As both farming and fishing have declined in the past few decades, better-educated young people tend to move out to live and work in urban areas. However, older villagers remain, most of whom live in Sha Tau Kok Chuen or in nearby villages. Many working families return to visit on the weekends, during festivals or on holidays to attend ceremonies, such as the deity-thanking ceremony at the Tin Hau temple in Yim Liu Ha.

As of the 2021 census, Sha Tau Kok has a population of 4,056 people. The male-to-female ratio is about 1.19, i.e. 835 females for every 1,000 males. The median age is 46.7 years old. The median monthly household income is HK$27,650.

== Government ==
Sha Tau Kok District is a rural committee district encompassing 46 villages within North District.

== Education ==
Sha Tau Kok is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 83. Within the school net are two aided schools (operated independently but funded with government money): Fuk Tak Education Society Primary School and Sha Tau Kok Central Primary School. No government schools are in the net.

Shan Tsui Public School () is in Sha Tau Kok. In 2013, 90% of the roughly 200 students were Hong Kong residents living in Shenzhen.

Other schools include Kwan Ah School, Sha Tau Kok Central Primary School, and Tai Wah Public Schools.

==Transportation==
Before there were roads to access Sha Tau Kok, a branch of the Kowloon–Canton Railway (KCR), Sha Tau Kok Railway, served as the town&#x27;s main transport. Completed in 1912, this service had three stops, linking Fanling Station to Sha Tau Kok Station. It was built from the original narrow gauge of the KCR British Section, and later replaced by standard gauge. After Sha Tau Kok Road was completed, the Sha Tau Kok Railway and its terminus ceased operations on 1 April 1928. The area formerly occupied by the terminus is still known colloquially as &quot;train station terminus&quot; (火車頭).

Currently, there are both Kowloon Motor Bus and minibus services in Sha Tau Kok. The town has a bus terminus served by the KMB route 78K service as well as the smaller sixteen-seater minibus or public light bus service route number 55K. Both begin in Sheung Shui and pass through Luen Wo Hui before terminating at Sha Tau Kok. Travelers can also board the KMB route 277A from Lam Tin station to Sha Tau Kok. Alternatively, visitors can also travel by taxi. However, passengers will not be allowed to proceed through the Closed Area border checkpoint if they do not carry a valid permit. Police personnel will board the bus at the checkpoint to check the identification documents and the required Frontier Closed Area permit of each passenger. If passengers do not possess these documents, they will be asked to leave by police personnel.

==Public pier==
The Sha Tau Kok Public Pier is located at the town&#x27;s northeast coast and is the longest pier in Hong Kong. It spans 280 meters to reach the deeper waters of Starling Inlet, allowing larger vessels to berth at Sha Tau Kok. The pier is used to load and unload goods and berth kaitos operating between Sha Tau Kok, Kat O, Sam A, Ap Chau, and other northeast rural areas. The original pier was built in the 1960s and renovated from 2004 to 2007. Previously, non-residents of Sha Tau Kok could not make use of kaitos departing from the pier for purposes of tourism to islands in Mirs Bay, and instead had to take a much longer journey from Ma Liu Shui pier via Tolo Harbour. As part of the Northern Metropolis development strategy, the government proposed to open Sha Tau Kok Public Pier to tour groups starting from mid-2022. Island hopping for tourists is now possible, with trips to other islands taking 20 to 30 minutes.

<text>Max Otto Lorenz ( ; September 19, 1876 – July 1, 1959) was an American economist who developed the Lorenz curve in an undergraduate essay. He published a paper on this when he was a doctoral student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. His doctoral thesis (1906) was on &#x27;The Economic Theory of Railroad Rates&#x27; and made no reference to perhaps his most famous paper. The term &quot;Lorenz curve&quot; for the measure Lorenz invented was coined by Willford I. King in 1912.

He was of German ancestry, his father having been born in Essen in the Rhine Province of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1841.

He was active in both publishing and teaching and was at various times employed by the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. Bureau of Railway Economics, the U.S. Bureau of Statistics and the U.S. Interstate Commerce Commission. In 1917 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.

He was married to Nellie, and fathered three sons.

<text>The Warrior of Hirschlanden (&quot;Krieger von Hirschlanden&quot; in German) is a statue of a warrior made of sandstone, the oldest known Iron Age life-size anthropomorphic statue north of the Alps. It was a production of the Hallstatt culture, probably dating to the 6th century BC. It is now in the Württembergisches Landesmuseum in Stuttgart, with a copy at the Hirschlanden site (now Ditzingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany), where it was found. The preserved height is 1.50 m, but the feet have been broken off.

==Description==
The warrior wears a torc (neck-ring), a belt with a typical late Hallstatt dagger, and a pointed hat, possibly made (as with the real hat in the princely grave of Hochdorf) of birchbark.

While the legs are modelled with some realism, the upper body is rather schematic and the face is extremely sketchy, leading to speculation that the man might be intended to be seen as wearing a mask, as is known from burials in Klein-Klein, Styria, Austria, Trebeništa (North Macedonia) and the much earlier shaft-graves of Mycenae, 1500 BC.

The statue shows significant weathering, suggesting that it stood exposed to the elements for a long time before being buried. Other anthropomorphic statues of the early Iron Age have been found in Rottenburg, Tübingen, Stammheim and Stockach (all Baden-Württemberg, Germany), but they are far more stylised, more carving than statue. In the following La Tène period, anthropomorphic statues are still very rare, but examples include the finds from Glauberg (Hessen, Germany), Holzgerlingen figure (Baden-Württemberg, Germany), the Mšecké Žehrovice Head (Bohemia), and the sculptures at Roquepertuse.

Greek influence (&quot;kouroi&quot;) has been discussed. Numerous black figure vessels from fortified settlements of the period attest trading contacts with the Mediterranean, probably via the Rhône River and the Greek colony of Massilia (Marseille). Much closer stylistic connections exist with the far more elaborate statues from Capestrano, Picenium, Italy (650-550 BC) and Casale Marittimo (middle of the 7th century).

==History==
The statue was found in Hirschlanden (now Ditzingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany) in 1963 when a low barrow was excavated. The barrow was surrounded by a stone circle and a dry stone wall. It contained 16 burials, ranging from the very beginning of the Iron Age (Hallstatt D1, 600 BC) to the beginning of the Late Iron Age (La Tène period, 450 BC). The statue was found north of the barrow, but is supposed to have been originally placed on the top.

<doc id="476636" wikidata="Q1572612" url="?curid=476636" title="Saudi–Yemen barrier">
<text>The Saudi–Yemen barrier () is a physical barrier constructed by Saudi Arabia along part of its border with Yemen. It is a structure made of pipeline three metres (10 ft) high filled with concrete, acting as a &quot;security barrier along sections of the now fully demarcated border with Yemen&quot; and fitted with electronic detection equipment.

Construction of the barrier began in September 2003 in order to counter infiltrations and terrorism. When construction of the barrier by the Saudis began, the Yemeni government strongly objected, stating that it violated a border treaty signed in 2000. Thus, Saudi Arabia agreed to stop construction in February 2004.

==History==
In 2000, after 65 years or so of sporadic conflict, Yemen and Saudi Arabia finally agreed on border demarcations by signing the 2000 Jeddah border treaty.

Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz, who has also been deputy prime minister and minister of defence, has long managed the Yemen portfolio. For decades, he paid a network of Yemeni contacts and informants, which generated resentment on the Yemeni side about Saudi &quot;meddling&quot;. Sultan also headed the small Special Office for Yemen Affairs, which remained the main locus of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Yemen policy and patronage throughout the 1980s and 1990s, a role that weakened beginning in 2000. Its annual budget was believed to be $3.5 billion per year until the Treaty of Jeddah was signed in 2000. But even as late as early 2011, the &quot;number of people thought to be receiving subsidies still remained in the thousands, but in April recipients were notified that payments were being terminated&quot;. The tribal elites Saudi Arabia supports to weaken Yemen central government are behind the drug trade. Saudi Arabia overreached, according to Yemen, &quot;by accusing Yemeni smugglers of fomenting terrorism&quot; because &quot;homegrown Saudi terrorists—with or without weapons obtained from across the border—cannot be blamed on Yemen&quot;.

In February 2004, after extensive Egyptian and U.S. diplomatic efforts, Saudi Arabia decided to halt the construction, and Yemen agreed to take part in joint patrols and to set up watch towers to curb smuggling and infiltration. However, it was reported in October 2006, after plans were revealed of Saudi plans to build another fence along its border with Iraq, that the Saudis have enjoyed &quot;relative success by building a similar, though shorter, security barrier-fence along their southern border with Yemen to cut down on the 400,000 illegal immigrants who cross it every year looking for work in the far more prosperous Saudi state. Saudi authorities also believe that the fence has &quot;made their efforts to prevent the infiltration of revolutionary Islamists through Yemen far easier&quot;. In February 2007 the &quot;Arab Times&quot; reported that the “Saudis have been quietly pursuing an $8.5 billion project to fence off the full length of its porous border with Yemen for some years”.

In January 2008, Saudi authorities commenced construction of a wall along the border in the Harad district. A local sheikh claimed that erection of the wall broke the Jeddah border treaty that established the rights of both Yemeni and Saudi citizens to roam freely. The news website &quot;Mareb Press&quot; reported quoted a Yemeni military source saying that Yemeni border guards tried to prevent the construction, but the Saudis mobilized and threatened force if they were unable to commence work. Deep tunnels and concrete arches have been constructed and barbed wire has been laid along the frontiers to the south of the Saudi towns of Towal, Masfaq, and Khawjarah. Local sources from Harad stated that over 3,000 tribesmen from nearby gathered to rally against it, claiming their interests would be harmed by preventing them from crossing the border to visit their relatives and cultivate their farms.

During the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, Saudi Arabia reportedly began removing sections of the Barrier fence along its border with the Sa&#x27;dah and Hajjah governorates on 3 April 2015. The purpose of the removal was not immediately clear.

===Ethiopian migrant incidents===

Over 90 percent of migrants on the &#x27;Eastern Route&#x27; to Saudi Arabia are Ethiopians. Reasons for migration include economic reasons, as well as seeking refuge from conflict, famine, and persecution. This treacherous journey begins in the Horn of Africa, spans the Gulf of Aden, traverses war-torn Yemen, and eventually winds its way through the rugged terrain of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Jizan province.

Since 2017, Saudi Arabia has engaged in the arbitrary detention and involuntary repatriation of a substantial number of Ethiopian migrants who were caught crossing the Saudi-Yemen border. These actions have exposed migrants to severe and degrading conditions, leading to the emergence of serious and enduring physical and psychological health issues among those affected. As of 2022, at least 30,000 Ethiopian migrants who come illegally through Saudi-Yemen barrier, remain detained in Saudi Arabia solely for lack of legal residency and continue to suffer in overcrowded detention centres, facing the looming threat of experiencing a similar ordeal. Amnesty International utilized satellite verification to corroborate the existence and pinpoint the exact locations of the Al-Kharj and Al-Shumaisi detention centers which are located in Riyadh and Jeddah respectively. Additionally, geo-verified videos sourced from within these facilities provided concrete evidence, shedding light on the severe and distressing conditions prevailing within. 

Borders guards of the Houthi who control the other side of the border have also been accused of mistreating Ethiopian migrants including sexually assaulting them.

Amnesty International&#x27;s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa, Heba Morayef, strongly condemned the deprivation of human rights solely based on the absence of legal documents. She emphasized that lacking legal documentation should not be used as a justification for such human rights violations.

In June 2023, the International Organization for Migration Missing Migrant Project issued its own estimate of fatalities on the Saudi border which reports 795 or more Ethiopians lost their lives on the route between Saudi Arabia and Yemen between March 2022 to June 2023. Accounts collected by Human Rights Watch suggests that explosive weapons were fired at Ethiopian migrants by Saudi border guards, dismembering and killing many. Saudi border guards have also been accused of forcing migrants to rape one another, reportedly summarily executing someone who refused to do so.

==Government stances==

===Saudi Arabian concerns===
In the early 1990s terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia used explosives that came from Yemen. The border is , with much in the Rub&#x27; al Khali desert, or the &quot;Empty Quarter&quot;. In October 2010 &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the border between Saudi Arabia and Yemen &quot;an emblem of the increasingly global threats emanating from Yemen: fighters from Al Qaeda, Shiite [Houthi] insurgents, drugs and arms smuggling and, well under the world’s radar, one of the largest flows of economic refugees on earth&quot;.

Saudi Arabia claimed the barrier was necessary to protect from terrorism and smuggling weapons and illegal drugs—namely qat (and Yemen&#x27;s most important export, with border tribes reportedly earning upwards of £100 million a year). Specifically, Saudi Arabia claimed that smugglers provide weapons to radical Islamists within Saudi Arabia and were the source of explosives used in attacks like the 2003 Riyadh compound bombings, which killed 35 and injured over a hundred. Two years after the Yemeni Revolution of 2011, the country found itself a &quot;haven for foreign terror fighters&quot; where the Yemen-based Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has &quot;remained resilient and even enjoyed a resurgence&quot;.

In 2008, after starting a new section of barrier in Harad District, the Saudis declared that the barrier was necessary to stem the influx of illegal immigrants and drug and weapons smuggling. Among the numerous Somali and Ethiopian refugees that arrive on Yemen&#x27;s shores, thousands of them cross over into Saudi Arabia every day through the Harad District. Yemen&#x27;s poverty means that most head to Saudi Arabia or other wealthy Gulf states that rely on imported menial labor. In addition, hundreds of Yemeni children have been trafficked in the past decade. In 2007 alone, more than 60,000 Yemenis were deported from Saudi Arabia.

=== Yemeni opposition ===
Opponents claim the barrier severely restricts the local population—in particular in their ability to cross the border to seek access work. The Yemeni government initially opposed the construction because it violated the 2000 Jeddah border treaty, which allowed for grazing rights for shepherds in a buffer zone on both sides and stipulated that no armed forces be stationed within it. The first stretch of the barrier was erected less than 100 metres from the border line. At the time, the head of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s border guard maintained that the barrier was being constructed inside Saudi territory.

Yemenis have complained that Saudi Arabia&#x27;s support for various tribal and political figures in Yemen seemed aimed at keeping their southern neighbor divided and weak. Saudi Arabia reportedly spent billions of dollars a year to weaken Yemen&#x27;s central rule and its republican government. As Yemen&#x27;s instability and the threat of terrorism grew increasingly worse, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported in 2010 that Western diplomats were noticing a shift in Saudi Arabia&#x27;s approach to Yemen and its longtime president Ali Abdullah Saleh (who ended up resigning in February 2012).

== Comparisons ==

===To Israeli West Bank barrier===
In February 2004 &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Yemeni opposition newspapers compared the barrier to the Israeli West Bank barrier, while &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote, &quot;Saudi Arabia, one of the most vocal critics in the Arab world of Israel&#x27;s &#x27;security fence&#x27; in the West Bank, is quietly emulating the Israeli example by erecting a barrier along its porous border with Yemen&quot;.

The head of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s border guard dismissed the comparison, stating, &quot;The barrier of pipes and concrete could in no way be called a separation fence. What is being constructed inside our borders with Yemen is a sort of screen...which aims to prevent infiltration and smuggling&quot;.
However, only 10% of the Israeli barrier is concrete wall, with the remaining 90% chain-link fence.

<text>The berimbau (, borrowed from Kimbundu &quot;mbirimbau&quot;) is a traditional Angolan musical bow that is commonly used in Brazil. It is also known as &quot;sekitulege&quot; among the Baganda and Busoga.

It consists of a single-stringed bow attached to a gourd resonator and is played with a stick and a coin or stone to create different tones and rhythms.

The berimbau was used in many parts of Africa and Brazil during the 19th century to accompany chants and storytelling. It is part of the candomblé tradition, later incorporated into the Afro-Brazilian art capoeira. Until the mid-20th century, it was used almost exclusively within the black community, but after the popularization of capoeira, it gain wider popularity.

Today, berimbau is used in various genres of popular music.

== History ==
Berimbau is an adaptation of African gourde musical bows, as no Indigenous Brazilian or European people use musical bows. According to the musicologist Gerard Kubik, the &quot;berimbau&quot; and the &quot;southwest Angolan variety called &quot;mbulumbumba&quot; are identical in construction and playing technique, as well as in tuning and in a number of basic patterns played.&quot; The assimilation of this Angolan instrument is evident also in other Bantu terms used for musical bow in Brazilian Portuguese, including &quot;urucungo&quot;, and &quot;madimba lungungu&quot;.

In 1859, French journalist Charles Ribeyrolles described free practices of African slaves on a plantation in Rio de Janeiro province, linking the berimbau to the batuque:

The berimbau first appeared as an instrument accompanying capoeira in the early 20th century in Bahia. The berimbau slowly came to replace the drum as the central instrument for the capoeira game, which it is now famous for and widely associated with.

== As a weapon ==

Mestre Pastinha recalls that the capoeiristas during the prohibition used to attach a double-edged sickle to the instrument, turning it into a deadly weapon when necessary: &quot;&quot;In the moment of truth it would cease to be a musical instrument and would turn into a hand sickle&quot;.&quot; Mestre Noronha also claimed that the berimbau was a very useful weapon to the old capoeira masters of the 1920s who resisted police repression. The berimbau was used as a weapon either with one end sharpened or by attaching a blade to one end, making it the capoeira&#x27;s longest-range weapon.

The practice of hiding weapons inside musical instruments dates back to at least the early 19th century. On November 16, 1832, the police inspector in Rio reported that capoeiras conceal spears and weapons in &quot;marimba&quot;s and sugarcane pieces.

==Design==

The berimbau consists of a wooden bow (&quot;verga&quot; – traditionally made from &quot;biribá&quot; wood, which grows in Brazil), about long, with a steel string (&quot;arame&quot; – often pulled from the inside of an automobile tire) tightly strung and secured from one end of the verga to the other. A gourd (&quot;cabaça&quot;), dried, opened and hollowed-out, attached to the lower portion of the verga by a loop of tough string, acts as a resonator.

Starting in the 1950s, Brazilian berimbaus were painted in bright colors, following local Brazilian taste; today, most makers follow the tourist consumer&#x27;s quest for (faux) authenticity, and use clear varnish and discreet decoration.

To play the berimbau, one holds it in one hand, wrapping the two middle fingers around the verga, and placing the little finger under the cabaça&#x27;s string loop (the &quot;anel&quot;), and balancing the weight there. A small stone or coin (&quot;pedra&quot; or &quot;dobrão&quot;) is held between the index and thumb of the same hand that holds the berimbau. The cabaça is rested against the abdomen. In the other hand, one holds a stick (&quot;baqueta&quot; or &quot;vaqueta&quot; – usually wooden, very rarely made of metal) and a shaker (&quot;caxixi&quot;). One strikes the arame with the baqueta to produce the sound. The caxixi accompanies the baqueta. The dobrão is moved back and forth from the arame to change the pitch produced by the berimbau. The sound can also be altered by moving the cabaça back and forth from the abdomen, producing a wah-like sound.

Parts and accessories of the berimbau:
*Verga: wooden bow that makes up the main body of the Berimbau
*Arame: steel string
*Cabaça: opened, dried and hollowed out gourd-like fruit secured to the lower portion of the berimbau, used to amplify and resonate the sound

Calling the cabaça a gourd is technically a mistake. As far as Brazilian berimbaus are concerned, the fruit used for the berimbau&#x27;s resonator, while still known in Brazil as cabaça (&quot;gourd&quot;), it is not technically a gourd (family Cucurbitaceae); instead, it is the fruit of an unrelated species, the tree &quot;Crescentia cujete&quot; (family Bignoniaceae), known in Brazil as &quot;calabaça&quot;, &quot;cueira&quot;, &quot;cuia&quot;, or &quot;cabaceira&quot;.

*Pedra or Dobrão: small stone or coin pressed against the arame to change the tone of the berimbau
*Baqueta: small stick struck against the arame to produce the sound
*Caxixi: small rattle that optionally accompanies the baqueta in the same hand

Capoeiristas split berimbaus in three categories:
*&quot;Gunga&quot; (others say &quot;Berra-boi&quot;): lowest tone
*&quot;Médio&quot; (others say &quot;Viola&quot;): medium tone
*&quot;Viola&quot; (&quot;Violinha&quot; if the medium tone is Viola): highest tone

These categories relate to sound, not to size. The berimbau&#x27;s quality does not depend on the length of the verga or the size of the gourd, rather on the diameter and hardness of the verga&#x27;s wood and the quality of the cabaça.

==Sound==

The berimbau, as played for capoeira, basically has three sounds: the open string sound, the high sound, and the buzz sound.

*In playing the buzz sound, one holds easily the gourd closed against one&#x27;s belly, while touching the string with the dobrão. A muted &quot;tch&quot; sound emerges.
*To play the open string sound, one strikes the string less than an inch up from the gourd string, with the bow balanced on the little finger so that the gourd is opened. One can grossly tune the open sound, by loosening the arame, and by sliding the gourd a little up or down from the place where the sound is best.
*To produce the high sound, one must hold the bow in the same way, gourd opened, and forcefully press the dobrão on the string. The sound differs from the low sound in tone and in timbre. Old recordings and musicians report that the difference in tone used to be about 1 tone (the interval from C to D). One can press the dobrão away enough from the gourd for this only if the bow is about to 4 feet 2 inches (122 to 127 cm); that was the length of the bows in the 1940s and 1950s. Today, many berimbaus are overgrown to , and tuning options are limited in berimbau ensembles.

Other sounds may appear in a berimbau performance, but only these define capoeira&#x27;s rhythmic patterns (except Iuna).

Closing and opening the gourd while the string resounds produces a wah-wah effects, which depends on how large the gourd opening is. Whether this effect is desirable or not is a matter of controversy. Pressing the dobrão after striking the string is a widely used technique; so is closing neatly the gourd while the string resounds to shut off the sound. A specific toque requires the open string sound with closed gourd. Musicians use whatever sound they may get out of the string. It is not often considered bad practice to strike other parts of the instrument. As with most aspects of playing the berimbau, the names of the techniques differ from teacher to teacher. Most teachers, and most students, worry more about producing a nice sound than about naming the individual sounds.

Of course, the strength (velocity, accent) with which one lets the baqueta hit the string is paramount to rhythm quality. The open sound is naturally stronger (meaning that, for a constant-strength strike, the other two sound weaker), but the musician may decide which strikes to stress. Also, the sound tone shifts a little with the strength of the strike, and some sophisticated toques make use of this.

==In capoeira music ==

In capoeira, the berimbau commands the &quot;roda&quot;, the circle where capoeiristas engage in the game, and by extension, the game itself. The music required from the berimbau is essentially rhythmic. Most of the patterns, or toques, derive from a single basic structure. Capoeira musicians produce many variations upon the basic pattern. They give names to known variations, and when such a named variation occurs repeatedly while playing, they call what they are playing by the name of that variation. The most common names are &quot;Angola&quot; and &quot;São Bento Grande&quot;. There is much talking about the meaning of these terms.

In capoeira Angola, three Berimbaus play together. Each berimbau holds a position in relation to the &quot;roda&quot;:

*The &quot;gunga&quot; plays &quot;Angola&quot; and is most commonly played by a &quot;mestre&quot; or the highest grade capoeirista around. Depending on the style of the group and the personality of the individual, the gunga may improvise a lot or stick strictly to the main rhythm. The person playing the gunga at the beginning of a roda is often the leader of the roda and the other instruments follow as well. The gunga player may also lead the singing, which is made easier by the simple rhythm and little variation that he plays. The gunga is used to call players to the pé-do-berimbau (foot of the berimbau, where players enter the game).
*The &quot;médio&quot; plays &quot;Sao Bento Pequeno&quot;. For instance, while the gunga may play a simple, eight-unit pattern like (xxL.H.H.), the viola (or médio) can play a sixteen-unit variation, like (xxL.xLHL|.xL.H.H.). The dialog between gunga and viola (or médio) gives the &quot;toque&quot; its character. In the context of capoeira Angola, the médio inverts the gunga&#x27;s melody (Angola toque): (xxL.H...) by playing São Bento Pequeno: (xxH.L...) with moderate improvisation.
*The &quot;viola&quot; plays &quot;Sao Bento Grande&quot;. Mostly variations and improvisations. It may be described as the &quot;lead guitar&quot; of the &quot;bateria&quot;.

Tuning in capoeira is also loosely defined. The berimbau is a microtonal instrument and while one can be tuned to play a major or minor 2nd, the actual tone is approximately a neutral second lying between a whole and half tone.

The berimbaus may be tuned to the same pitch, differing only in timbre. More commonly, low note of the médio is tuned in unison to the high note of the Gunga, and likewise for the viola to the médio. Others like to tune the instruments in 4ths (C, F, B flat) or a triad (C, E, G). Any tuning is acceptable provided it sounds good to the master&#x27;s ear.

There are countless different rhythms or &quot;toques&quot; played on the berimbau.

===Toques===
Common toques names are:
* Angola: rests on (does not play) the last beat of the basic leaving (xxL.H...)
* São Bento Pequeno de Angola Invertido: similar to Angola but with the high and low tones reversed (xxH.L...). São Bento Pequeno is typically played on Médio in conjunction with Angola on the Gunga.
* São Bento Grande: adds an extra hit to São Bento Pequeno, (xxH.L.L.)
* São Bento Grande da Regional (or São Bento Grande de Bimba): an innovation of Mestre Bimba, is often played in the two bar pattern (xxL.xxH.|xxL.L.H.)
* Toque de Iúna: introduced to capoeira by Mestre Bimba. (L-L-L-L-L-xxL-L.) (the &#x27;-&#x27; = touching the dobrão to the arame without hitting).
* Cavalaria: in the past, used to warn Capoeiristas of the approach of police. (L.xxL.xxL.xxL.H.) is one example, variations exist.

In notating the toques, it is a convention to begin with the two buzzed tones, however it is worthwhile to note that they are pickups to the downbeat, and would more properly be transcribed: xx(L.H...xx)

São Bento Grande as played in a regional setting places the main stress or downbeat at the final L so that it sounds: (L.xxH.L.|L.xxH.L.L)

Other toques include Idalina: (L.L.x.H.|xxL.L.H.), Amazonas: (xxLLxxLH|xxLLLLLH), Banguela: (xxL.H.H.), all deriving from the basic capoeira pattern. The toque called &quot;Santa Maria&quot; is a four bar transcription of the corridos &quot;Santa Maria&quot; and &quot;Apanha Laranja no Chão Tico Tico&quot;. (xxL.LLL.|xxL.LLH.|xxH.HHH.|xxH.LHL.)

Capoeiristas also play samba, before or after capoeira, with the proper toques, deriving from the samba de roda rhythmic pattern: (xxH.xxH.xx.H.HH.)

<doc id="476640" wikidata="Q1171263" url="?curid=476640" title="Celtic Pride">
<text>Celtic Pride is a 1996 American sports comedy film written by Judd Apatow and Colin Quinn, and directed by Tom DeCerchio. It stars Daniel Stern and Dan Aykroyd as Mike O&#x27;Hara and Jimmy Flaherty, two passionate Boston Celtics fans, and Damon Wayans as Lewis Scott, the Utah Jazz&#x27;s All-Star shooting guard.

==Plot==
Best friends for life, physical education teacher Mike O&#x27;Hara and plumber Jimmy Flaherty are united by their love of Boston and its sports teams, especially the Boston Celtics, who are playing their last season in the old Boston Garden. When the Celtics drop Game 6 of the NBA Finals to the Utah Jazz, setting up a deciding Game 7 in Boston, Mike and Jimmy find themselves depressed and hopeless. On top of all this, Mike has moved back in with Jimmy after his wife Carol, fed up with his unhealthy obsession with the Celtics, left him and took their son Tommy with her.

Jimmy and Mike stumble upon the Jazz&#x27;s selfish, arrogant shooting guard Lewis Scott at a Boston nightclub. Hoping at first to get him so drunk that he will be hungover for Game 7, Mike and Jimmy pose as Utah fans. However, the pair get more than they bargained for when the next morning they end up kidnapping Scott after he wakes up at Jimmy&#x27;s apartment. The two decide to hold Scott until after the game, reasoning that if they are going to prison, they might as well help the Celtics win in the meantime.

Scott derides them for being washed-up losers and insinuates Mike (who had played college ball but was not good enough to go professional) is only after him because he is jealous of Scott&#x27;s fame and ability. Mike, on the other hand, berates Scott for his behavior on and off the court, including starring in a campy Oscar Mayer hot dog commercial, skipping practices, and disrespecting his teammates. Scott attempts to turn Jimmy against Mike and manages to free himself, only to be foiled by an antagonistic cabbie and a local cop, Kevin, both fellow Celtics fans. 
Ultimately, Mike challenges Scott to a game of one-on-one; the canny Scott is able to subdue him and Jimmy with Jimmy&#x27;s gun. Before he runs off, Scott presents the pair with a dilemma: they must root for him and the Jazz to win, or he will turn them both in to the police. Mike reconciles with his wife and son, knowing he might be going to prison, and Jimmy says goodbye to his grandmother. At the game, the two convince the other Celtics fans they are only pretending to root for the Jazz to jinx them, and the first half ends with the Celtics leading. Mike, who knows the Jazz are losing because Scott refuses to pass the ball, gives him a pep talk from the stands, and Utah closes the gap to one point with a little over 7 seconds remaining.

With one play left and the Jazz seemingly on the verge of defeat, Mike and Jimmy choose life over the Celtics, rooting for Utah and rushing the court after they win. Approached by Kevin, who earlier ignored his cries for help, Scott denies Mike and Jimmy committed the kidnapping, saving them from prison.

A few months later, Mike has reconciled with his wife by promising to never interfere with an NBA Finals game again. When football season begins, however, he and Jimmy sneak into Deion Sanders&#x27; hotel room at 3:00 a.m., presumably to kidnap him.

==Cast==
==Reception==
The film was not a major success despite its star power, grossing less than $10 million domestically. The film received negative reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 12% based on reviews from 25 critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of B− on a scale of A to F.

Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Celtic Pride&quot; is clearly intended as a spoof on the contemporary mania for athletics. But not only is the picture woefully short on laughs, it&#x27;s also coarse, overbearing and, in places, downright insulting&quot;. &quot;TV Guide&quot; said &quot;&quot;Celtic Pride&quot; supplies predictably lowbrow yocks for jocks, and its rather disturbing racial implications go entirely unacknowledged,&quot; and awarded it 1 and half stars out of five.

In a positive review, Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; said &quot;Not quite a three-pointer, but definitely more than an airball, &quot;Celtic Pride&quot; is an uneven but largely likable basketball-themed comedy that should lay up decent B.O. numbers and perform even better in the homevid arena.&quot;

Bill Murray has said he has seen this film and has credited it as to why he turns down role offers from Judd Apatow.

<doc id="476649" wikidata="Q214173" url="?curid=476649" title="Trujillo, Peru">
<text>Trujillo (; ; Mochica: &quot;Cɥimor&quot;) is a city in coastal northwestern Peru and the capital of the Department of La Libertad. It is the third most populous city and center of the third most populous metropolitan area of Peru. It is located on the banks of the Moche River, near its mouth at the Pacific Ocean, in the Moche Valley. This was a site of the great prehistoric Moche and Chimu cultures before the Inca conquest and subsequent expansion.

The Independence of Trujillo from Spain was proclaimed in the Historic Centre of Trujillo on December 29, 1820, and the city was honored in 1822 by the Congress of the Republic of Peru with the title &quot;Meritorious City and Faithful to the Fatherland&quot;, for its role in the fight for Peruvian independence. Trujillo is the birthplace of Peru&#x27;s judiciary, and it was twice designated as the capital of the country. It was the scene of a military revolt in 1932. Trujillo is considered the &quot;cradle of liberty and cradle of the judiciary in Peru&quot;.

Trujillo is also known as the &quot;City of Everlasting Spring&quot;, is considered the &quot;Capital of the Marinera&quot;, a traditional dance in Peru, &quot;Cradle of the Peruvian Paso horse&quot;, as well as the &quot;Capital of Culture of Peru&quot;. It has sponsored numerous national and international cultural events, and has a lively arts community. Current festivals include the &quot;National Marinera Festival&quot;, the Trujillo Spring Festival and the International Book Festival, which is one of the most important cultural events in the country.

Trujillo is close to two major archeological sites of pre-Columbian monuments: Chan Chan, the largest adobe city in the ancient world, designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1986; and the temples of the Sun and Moon (the largest adobe pyramid in Peru).

The city center contains many examples of colonial and religious architecture, often incorporating distinctive wrought ironwork. It includes residential areas, a central business district, and industrial supply distribution to the various districts. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Trujillo has its seat here. Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion and 10 colonial churches are located within the old city wall, now encircled by Avenida España; additional churches in the towns of Huamán, Huanchaco and Moche are located within of Trujillo&#x27;s centre.

Since 2011, the city has been developing the pilot project &quot;Trujillo: Sustainable City&quot;, as part of the platform &quot;Emerging and Sustainable Cities of the Inter-American Development Bank&quot;, in cooperation with the IDB. In 2012 Trujillo was selected by IBM to participate in a &quot;Smarter Cities Challenge&quot; project intended to improve public safety and transportation through technology.

==Identity==

===Capital of culture===
Trujillo is considered the &quot;Capital of Culture of Peru&quot; for the prominent writers associated with the city such as Cesar Vallejo and Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, and because the city is a center for important cultural expressions as the marinera dance, Peruvian paso horses, caballitos de totora, Trujillo&#x27;s gastronomy, etc. The North Group was formed here, with Eduardo González Viaña and Gerardo Chávez as successors. The city presents important national festivals, such as Marinera Festival, Spring Festival, and competitions for the paso horse and caballito de totora.

===Symbols===

====Coat of arms====
The coat of arms of the city was awarded on December 7, 1537, by Royal Decree issued by the King of Spain, Charles V. The shield consists of two columns rising from water, a king&#x27;s crown on top surrounded by pearls and precious stones and two staffs that surround the letter K (for &quot;Karolus&quot;, royal cypher of the King); and on the back is a black griffin facing right and supporting the shield.

====Flag====
The flag is the coat of arms on a white background; it is carried during the official ceremonies of the Municipality of Trujillo in the main square of the city. Also it is flown every December 29 to commemorate the proclamation of independence of Trujillo in 1820.

====Anthem====
The anthem was written by Ramiro Mendoza Sánchez with music composed by Ramiro Herrera Orbegoso. It is performed mainly for official civic ceremonies, by bands of musicians.

==History==
The history of Trujillo has its beginning in ancient times, as the area at the mouth of the Moche River was long a center of successive pre-European cultures. They extended their domains along the northern coast of Peru.

===Pre-Columbian era===


The archaeological history of this region goes back to the early pre-ceramic period. For example, Huaca Prieta was occupied as early as 4700 BC.

Several ancient cultures developed in this area: the Cupisnique, the Moche and Chimu. Numerous archaeological sites and monumental remains attest to the high degree of complexity of these civilizations.

Among the Cupisnique culture sites are Caballo Muerto and Huaca Prieta.

The Moche culture sites include huacas: the Temples of the Sun and Moon south of the city, the Huaca del Dragón (or Rainbow Huaca) and the Huaca Esmeralda to the north, and others.

The Chimu culture built its primary settlement at what is known as Chan Chan, which was the capital, having an estimated 100,000 people at its peak. It is the largest pre-Columbian city built of adobe and has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its remains are northwest of the current city center. The present Spanish–Peruvian city of Trujillo was founded in an ancestral territory populated by ancient indigenous civilizations. The Spanish founded new cities expressing their culture in what they called the &quot;Viceroyalty of Peru&quot;.

====Southern Moche civilization====
The Southern Moche civilization flourished in northern Peru with its Huacas del Sol y de la Luna from about AD 100 to 800, during the Regional Development Epoch. The people likely had formed into a group of autonomous polities that shared a common elite culture, as seen in the rich iconography and monumental architecture that survive today. They are particularly noted for their elaborately-painted ceramics, gold work, monumental constructions (huacas) and irrigation systems.

Moche history is broadly divided into three periods – the emergence of the Moche culture in the Early Moche (AD 100–300), its expansion and florescence during the Middle Moche (300–600), and the urban nucleation and subsequent collapse in the Late Moche (500–750). Moche society was agriculture-based, and the cultural leaders invested in the construction of a network of irrigation canals for the diversion of river water to supply the crops. Their culture was sophisticated; and their artifacts fully express their lives, including scenes of hunting, fishing, fighting, sacrifice, elaborate ceremonies, and sexual acts.

====Chimu Empire====

The Chimu built and occupied a territory known as Chimor, with its capital at the city of Chan Chan, a large adobe city in the Valley of Moche (around which present-day Trujillo city developed). The culture arose about 900 and flourished into the 14th century. 

The Chimos were characterized by speaking the Quingnam language, one of the languages that is certain to have existed in the ancient province of Trujillo:

The Inca ruler Tupac Inca Yupanqui led a campaign which conquered the Chimu in around 1470.

This was just 50 years before the arrival of the Spanish in the region. Consequently, Spanish chroniclers recorded accounts of Chimu culture from persons who had lived before the Inca conquest. Similarly, archaeological evidence suggest Chimor emerged from the remnants of Moche culture; early Chimu pottery had some resemblance to that of the Moche. Their ceramics are all-black, and their work in precious metals is very detailed and intricate. In the Late Chimu period, about 12,000 artisans lived and worked in Chan Chan alone. They engaged in fishing, agriculture, craft work, and trade. Artisans were forbidden to change their profession, and were grouped together in the citadel according to their area of specialization. Archeologists have noted a dramatic rise in the volume of Chimu craft production, which they attribute to artisans having been brought to Chan Chan from another area taken in conquest. As there is evidence of both metalwork (generally a male specialty) and weaving (a female art) in the same domestic dwelling, it is likely that both men and women were artisans. The men engaged in fishing, heavy agriculture (aided by irrigation and earthworks), and metallurgy. The women made ceramics and textiles (from spun and dyed cotton, llama, alpaca, and vicuña wool). People used reed fishing canoes, hunted, and traded using bronze coins.

In 2018 archaeologists uncovered the world’s largest child-sacrifice site at Trujillo. &quot;National Geographic&quot; discovered the remains of over 140 children and the skeletons of llamas, apparently the result of ritual sacrifice.

===Colonial era===

====Spanish foundation====
Trujillo was one of the first cities in the Americas founded by the Spanish conquistadors. They arrived in an area that had been inhabited and developed for thousands of years by the indigenous peoples. According to historian Napoleón Cieza Burga, the conquistador Diego de Almagro founded the first settlement in November 1534, calling it &quot;Trujillo of New Castile&quot; after Trujillo, the home city of Francisco Pizarro. It was founded among four Chimu settlements: Huanchaco, Huamán, Moche and Mampuesto, to create an alliance against the Incas. On November 23, 1537, King Charles I of Spain gave the town the rank of &#x27;city&#x27; and the coat of arms that remains a symbol for the city; it was the first city in Peru to receive a coat of arms from the king. By 1544 Trujillo had around 300 homes and 1,000 inhabitants, and an economy booming from the cultivation of sugar cane, wheat, and other food crops and the raising of livestock.

The Spanish colonists welcomed a diverse array of religious orders from the time of its founding, and there was a boom in church construction in the city during the 16th and 17th centuries. In 1577 Pope Gregory XIII created the Diocese of Trujillo, and in 1616 construction work commenced on the cathedral.

On February 14, 1619, Trujillo was struck by an earthquake, resulting in the near-total destruction of the city and the deaths of around 400 of its inhabitants. Rebuilding was slow. The people developed a devotion to Saint Valentine, on whose day the earthquake hit. The Jesuits opened a seminary and school for the education and training of priests; they also served as missionaries to the indigenous peoples, as they introduced Christianity.

====17th century====

=====The Wall of Trujillo=====
Due to the proximity of the city to the sea (about away) and the danger of attack by pirates and privateers, the Wall of Trujillo was built for defense during the reign of Viceroy Melchor de Navarra and Rocafull and the city mayors Bartolome Martinez and Fernando Ramirez Jarabeitia Orellana. This wall was built by an Italian architect, Giuseppe Formento, who began construction on February 19, 1687. Formento based his design on that by Leonardo da Vinci for the Italian city of Florence. The wall was designed in an elliptical shape to save costs in its construction, and was completed in 1689. The wall reached a perimeter of and used more than 100,000 bricks. The defensive structure was composed of 15 bastions, 15 shades and 5 covered gates.

The Huamán Gate was oriented westward to the road to the village of the same name. The Mansiche Gate was located to the north, giving way to the highway. The Miraflores Gate opened to the east. The Sierra Gate was named after the road leading to this region. Lastly, the Moche Gate gave access to people coming from the south. In 1942 the city developed a master plan; following the path of the ancient wall, it built Avenida España to encircle the area now called the Historical Center of Trujillo.

In the latter half of the 17th century, severe droughts and pestilence caused a major economic crisis for the city, which depended on agriculture. Trujillo regained prominence in the 18th century, in part due to the destruction of the city of Saña by flooding in 1720. Trujillo also suffered from flooding in 1701, 1720, 1728 and 1814; and earthquakes in 1725 and 1759.

By 1760 an estimated 9,200 people were living in the vicinity of the city. The foundation of the Municipality of Trujillo in 1779 coincided with a peak of prosperity for the city. Numerous undeveloped lots remained within the city walls but Trujillo was regarded as one of the most important cities in Northern Peru during the colonial era.

===Independence===
Inspired by liberal ideas from members of its educational institutions, Trujillo became a principal centre of Peruvian republican sentiments. Led by the city mayor and intendant José Bernardo de Tagle, the Intendancy of Trujillo declared its independence from Spain on December 29, 1820.

Between 1821 and 1825 the Trujillo region was the only stable and productive land within the nascent republic. In 1823 Trujillo took on the role of the first capital city of the Republic of Peru. On July 19, 1823, the Peruvian Congress located here repeated its invitation to Simón Bolívar, a leader in Bolivia, to join the war of independence. In 1824 the city received the liberation army of Bolívar, and was again designated as the seat of government. It is the only city to have twice been designated as the capital.

The years following the revolution saw the growth in the economic influence of the city, compensating for a loss of political power to Lima when it was designated as the capital, which instead suffered from the resulting political turmoil. The Moche and Chicama valleys emerged as new economic enclaves for the sugar cane industry. Land was increasingly concentrated in large estates and a new &quot;agricultural aristocracy&quot; developed that was linked to and influenced national political power. The policy of free trade and openness to foreign investment attracted an influx of Europeans, principally from Britain and Germany. By then, Trujillo had a population of 15,000 and began to grow beyond the city walls. New architectural styles were adopted, influenced by French and English Romanticism.

During the War of the Pacific against Chile between 1879 and 1883, Trujillo contributed troops towards national defence. Although never a site of battle, Trujillo suffered from occupation by Chilean troops and their plundering of the surrounding countryside.

====First Independent City of Peru====

It is considered the &quot;First Independent City of Peru&quot; for three reasons: it proclaimed independence from Spain on December 24, 1820 at the historical &quot;Casa de la Emancipación&quot; (House of Emancipation). Its leaders signed the declaration of independence at the Seminario de San Carlos y San Marcelo and proclaimed independence to an open council meeting in the Plaza de Armas, on December 29, 1820. Finally, on January 6, 1821, its leaders ratified the agreement and the proclamation of the independence of this city, as stated in the document called &quot;Libro rojo&quot; (the Red Book) of the Trujillo council.

Their actions gained independence for almost all of northern Peru, because the government of Trujillo city ruled what is now the regions of Tumbes, Piura, Lambayeque, La Libertad, Cajamarca, San Martín and Amazonas. Marquis of Torre Tagle said, &quot;My people. From this time for the unanimous will of the people, Trujillo is free. I put our fate and that of people under the protection of Heaven! Long live the homeland! Long live independence!&quot;
===Republican era===

The Provisional Regulations given by General San Martín in 1821 created the Department of Trujillo, based on colonial administration. This status was acknowledged in the first Constitution of Peru in 1823. Because of its size and economic wealth, the Department of Trujillo between 1821 and 1825 was the only stable and productive area that could organize and lead the nascent republic. The department encompassed nearly half the country. For the efforts of its people in the war of emancipation, San Martín gave it the title of &quot;Meritorious City Loyal to the Homeland&quot;. The municipality of the city, then called a &quot;cabildo&quot;, was given the rank of &quot;honorable&quot;.

In 1823, after the creation of the Republic of Peru, the protectorate of José de San Martín was developed. Before royal troops took the city of Lima, the first President of Peru, Don José de la Riva Agüero, together with Sánchez Carrión, named Trujillo as provisional capital of the country, which survived for a short period.

In 1824 the city received the liberation army of Simón Bolívar. Taking over the government of the country, he established a temporary government of the country in Trujillo, on March 8, 1824.

In 1821 the Court of Appeals was created to replace the Royal Court. Its jurisdiction extended over the present departments of Cajamarca, Piura, Lambayeque, Amazonas (then known as the Chachapoyas), and Huamachuco (then known as Sánchez Carrión). On March 26, 1824 Simón Bolívar established Trujillo&#x27;s first Superior Court of Justice as the Northern Superior Court. It had been the first high court established in the Republic of Peru with the powers of the Supreme Court.

====19th century====
By the end of the 19th century the five entrances had disappeared from the city, so it was that during this time the Wall of Trujillo was torn down and allowed the growth of the city. This urban expansion allowed the establishment of the neighborhoods of Chicago, La Unión and Pedro Muñiz. During the administration of Don Víctor Larco Herrera as mayor, the city began upgrading works such as the construction of City Hall, the arrangement and embellishment of the Plaza de Armas and the atrium of the cathedral. It also built the road to the resort of Buenos Aires, which expanded the city urban planning perspective. Another project was the renovation of the Municipal Theater.

====20th century====

In July 1932, Trujillo was once again at the centre of one of the most important episodes in the history of the Republic of Peru, the 1932 Trujillo uprising, which cost the lives of many citizens. Although this year came to be known as the &quot;year of barbarism&quot;, it would also mark the political identity of the city during the second half of the 20th century.

The latter half of the 20th century saw the expansion of the city due to a combination of rural-to-urban migration and the consolidation of surrounding districts into the Trujillo metropolitan area.

From 1980 Trujillo took on the aspect and behavior of a particularly dynamic metropolitan area, by which time the growth of the city and adjoining districts had produced a single metropolitan area, so in the 1980s the nascent Trujillo metropolitan area consisted of the integrated urban districts of Trujillo, El Porvenir and Florencia de Mora, with Víctor Larco Herrera and La Esperanza remaining discontinuous districts. In 1981 the city had 403,337 inhabitants. Also in the 1980s the Trujillo Industrial Park project was begun, located on the north side of the city, in the present La Esperanza district.

With the advent of the 1990s, the city of Trujillo was unified with the districts of La Esperanza and Victor Larco Herrera and the spread of the city resulted in the districts of Moche, Trujillo, Salaverry, and Laredo becoming part of the metropolitan area. In the first half of the 1990s, after the emergence of the El Milagro area in Huanchaco, it was joined to La Esperanza district, and increasing interdependence with the districts of Moche and Laredo, which was cemented Trujillo as a new metropolis of Peru, then with a population of 589,314 inhabitants.

====21st century====

=====Modernization of the city=====
With the experience of the last two decades of the 20th century, when the city experienced an excessive disordered growth while increasing the costs for providing basic services to the population, the Provincial Municipality of Trujillo created the Trujillo Metropolitan Development Plan 2010, known as &quot;Plandemetru&quot;, which was approved by city ordinance on November 30, 1995. Through this was planned the growth and development of the city up to 2010; later the lines of development of the metropolis were governed by the &quot;Strategic Plan for Integral Development and Sustainable Trujillo till 2015&quot; containing general guidelines for the development of the city by 2015.

=====Sustainable and smart city=====

In November 2010, Trujillo was the first city in Latin America and the Caribbean to be chosen by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to develop the pilot &quot;Sustainable City&quot; project as part of the platform &quot;Emerging and Sustainable Cities of the Inter-American Development Bank&quot;. This project includes a plan of action on climate change, which will be held on emissions limits in Trujillo, and will review the list of investment projects with respect to climate sustainability. According to IDB representative Fidel Jaramillo, Trujillo was chosen as the first driver of progress in Latin America to develop a new initiative. Trujillo&#x27;s plan is to conceive from other perspectives such as fiscal and financial sustainability, which is basic, but also from environmental sustainability and quality of life. The IDB is developing relevant projects in coordination with the Provincial Municipality of Trujillo. In 2012 Trujillo began to develop, with the support of American technology corporation IBM, the &quot;Smart City&quot; project, which will try to focus technologically on the two problems of public safety and transportation.

==Geography==

===Location===
Trujillo is located at an altitude of on a coastal strip in the west of the province of Trujillo, in the old valley of Chimor today known as the Moche or Santa Catalina Valley. Its main square is located at longitude at an altitude of above sea level and lies inland from the Pacific Ocean, in a straight line along Avenido Larco.

===Climate===
This city has a desert climate (&quot;BWh&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification) and it is known as &quot;La Ciudad de la Eterna Primavera&quot; (city of everlasting spring) because of its sunny and pleasant weather year-round. The &quot;International Spring Festival&quot; in early October attracts visitors from all over Peru and the world. The city is in an area of mild climate and low rainfall, with moderate temperatures ranging between due to the Humboldt Current.
Trujillo has a warm climate during the day and mild during the night due to the sea breeze. It has an average temperature of , and the extreme minimum and maximum temperatures fluctuate between in winter and summer, respectively. Rains are light, sporadic and occur during the afternoon or evening. The Andes and their foothills are very close to the coast, and having a lower elevation relative to the mountains of central and southern Peru, the flow of moist air from the Amazon region, which converges with the sea breezes from the west, favors during the summer a higher frequency of light showers. According to the climate classification of Thornthwaite, city of Trujillo would correspond to an arid climate type with no rain during all seasons.

The parts of the city closest to the sea experience haze during the morning and usually the temperature is lower than in the central and upper parts of the city.

<doc id="476654" wikidata="Q616345" url="?curid=476654" title="Little Christmas">
<text>Little Christmas (), also known as Old Christmas, is one of the traditional names among Irish Christians and the Amish for 6 January, which is also known more widely as the Feast of the Epiphany, celebrated after the conclusion of the twelve days of Christmastide. Epiphany, observed on 6 January, is preceded by Twelfth Night (Epiphany Eve) on 5 January. Believers prepare for Old Christmas through fasting, which is opened on Old Christmas through the consumption of Christmas dinner. The emphasis of Old Christmas celebrations is on reflecting on the birth of Jesus through attending church services and visiting with family. Popular Little Christmas customs include burning Christmas candles, singing Christmas carols, Epiphany singing, chalking the door, and having one&#x27;s house blessed.

==Origins==
Owing to differences in liturgical calendars, as early as the fourth century, the churches of the eastern Roman Empire were celebrating Christmas on 6 January, while those of the western Roman Empire were celebrating it on 25 December.

In October 1582, Pope Gregory XIII introduced the Gregorian calendar as a correction of the Julian calendar, because the latter has too many leap years that cause it to drift out of alignment with the solar year. This has liturgical significance since calculation of the date of Easter assumes that spring Equinox in the Northern Hemisphere occurs on 21 March. To correct the accumulated error, he ordained the date be advanced by ten days. Most Roman Catholic countries adopted the new calendar immediately and Protestant countries followed suit over the following 200 years. In particular, the British Empire (including the American colonies) did so from 1752 with the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750, by which time the divergence had grown to eleven days. This meant that Christmas Day on 25 December (&#x27;New Style&#x27;) was eleven days earlier than it would have been but for the Act, making &quot;Old Christmas&quot; [25 December (&#x27;Old Style&#x27;)] happen on 5 January (NS). In February 1800, the Julian calendar had another leap year but the Gregorian did not, moving Old Christmas to 6 January (NS), which coincided with the Feast of the Epiphany.

For this reason, in some parts of the world, the Feast of the Epiphany, which is traditionally observed on 6 January, is sometimes referred to as &quot;Old Christmas&quot; or &quot;Old Christmas Day&quot;. (Although 1900 was also not a leap year in the Gregorian calendar (and thus the Julian 25 December has since that year coincided with 7January in the Gregorian calendar) the custom of celebrating Little Christmas on 6January did not change.)

==Observance by country==
===Europe===
In the Scottish Highlands the term &quot;Little Christmas&quot; () is applied to New Year&#x27;s Day, also known as , or , while Epiphany is known as , the feast-day of the Kings. The Transalpine Redemptorists who live on Papa Stronsay in Scotland, celebrate &#x27;Little Christmas&#x27; on the twenty-fifth day of every month, except for December, when the twenty-fifth day is celebrated as Christmas Day. The custom of blessing homes on Epiphany developed because the feast commemorates the time that the three kings visited the home of the Holy Family.

In the late 19th Century, the day was also known as Little Christmas in some parts of England, such as Lancashire. In the Isle of Man, New Year&#x27;s Day on 1 January was formerly called in Manx, or &quot;Little Christmas Day&quot;, while 6 January was referred to as &quot;Old Christmas Day&quot;. The name &quot;Little Christmas&quot; is also found in other languages including Slovene (), Galician (), and Ukrainian.

In Scandinavia, where the main celebration of Christmas is on Christmas Eve (24 December), the evening of 23 December is known as &quot;little Christmas Eve&quot; ().

In some parts of the Spanish-speaking world, the emphasis of Christmas Day is on family dinner reunion and church attendance, while gifts are exchanged on the Feast of the Epiphany, when according to tradition the Three Wise Men (or Magi) brought gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh to the Child Jesus. Tradition names them Melchior, Caspar and Balthazar. It is an important celebration in Spanish-speaking countries, mainly dedicated to children, who receive their gifts on the morning of 6 January. In some countries, like Spain, it is a public holiday that marks the end of the Christmas season which started on Christmas Eve (24 December).

In the Western Christian world, the two traditional days when Christmas decorations are removed are Twelfth Night (the night before the Feast of the Epiphany) and if they are not taken down on that day, Candlemas, the latter of which ends the Christmas-Epiphany season in some denominations.

In Eastern Orthodox countries including Russia, &#x27;old Christmas&#x27; and &#x27;old New Year&#x27; are celebrated on the 6th and 14th of January in addition to the modern dates.

====Ireland: &quot;Nollaig na mBan&quot;, or Women&#x27;s Christmas ====
In Ireland, Little Christmas is also called (in Irish) or Women&#x27;s Christmas (in English). The day is so called because, traditionally, men would take on what would have been seen as the traditional &quot;female&quot; household duties for the day, giving women the day off. Goose was the traditional meat served on Women&#x27;s Christmas. 

Women customarily hold parties or go out to socialise with their female friends and relatives on the day. As a result, parties of women and girls are common in bars and restaurants on the night. While the tradition had been dying off in some parts of the country, the hospitality industry now specifically advertises events aimed at those celebrating Nollaig na mBan. In 2024, a number of &quot;Nollaig na mBan&quot; events took place around the country: Dublin City Council held a Nollaig na mBan Festival celebrating the women of the inner city; the men of Trillick St Macartan&#x27;s Gaelic Athletic Club organised and served at a &quot;thank you&quot; high tea for the women in their lives; and over 2,400 women took part in sea swims around the country to raise funds for Women&#x27;s Aid, a domestic violence charity.

In Ireland, it is the traditional day to remove the Christmas tree and decorations, as it is seen as bad luck to leave them in place past the twelfth day of Christmas. Until 2013, it was the last day of the Christmas holidays for both primary and secondary schools in Ireland.

===North America===
Some Anabaptists, such as the Amish and Mennonites, celebrate Christmas as a religious feast-day on 6 January. Believers prepare for Old Christmas through fasting, which is opened on Old Christmas through the consumption of Christmas dinner. The emphasis of Old Christmas celebrations is on reflecting on the birth of Jesus, as well as visiting with family and friends.

Celebration of Christmas Day on 6 January is reflected in the words of Cherry-Tree Carol, an English folk-song that migrated to Appalachia in the Eastern United States. In his paper &quot;The Observance of Old Christmas in Southern Appalachia&quot;, CRYoung writes &#x27;sometime before the twentieth century, singers who may have been Appalachian residents turned the question which Mary asks of Jesus in regard to &quot;what this world will be&quot; into a query which Joseph puts to the unborn baby. Taking &quot;Mary all on his left knee,&quot; he inquires when the birthday will be. Jesus responds:&#x27;
Young reports that &quot;Bill &#x27;Kitchen&#x27; Isom, an advocate of Old Christmas whose rendering of this carol Jean Thomas recorded in Carter County, Kentucky, gave the &#x27;wind up of it&#x27; in these words:
The holiday was also recognized by certain Ozark communities, &quot;&quot;In some sections of Arkansas there are people who bury the entrails of a black hen under the hearth on &quot;Old Christmas.&quot; This is said to protect the house against destruction by lightning or fire. [...] I know that some &quot;peckerwood families&quot; did bury chicken guts under their hearths as recently as 1935, not far from the enlightened metropolis of Hot Springs.&quot;&quot;

==Other meanings==
A &quot;Little Christmas&quot; is also a figure in Irish set dancing. It refers to a figure where half the set, four dancers, join with hands linked behind partners lower back, and the whole figure proceeds to rotate in a clockwise motion, usually for eight bars.
In the dance concerned, female participants enacted the traditional celebration&#x27;s house visits and slightly subversive tone by taking the active &quot;male&quot; role of switching from partner to partner.

<text>Vadim Nikolayevich Salmanov (4 November 1912, in Saint Petersburg – 27 February 1978, in Leningrad) was a Soviet composer and pedagogue.

Salmanov learned to play the piano as a child from his father who was a professional metallurgical engineer. Exposed to composers from the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods, Salmanov quickly grew fond of music and was quickly enrolled in music theory courses at the age of six. However, following the passing Salmanov&#x27;s father, he went to work at a factory and soon became interested in the topic of hydrogeology. 

At 18, he was about to attend the Leningrad Conservatory when he decided to study hydrogeology instead, eventually working as a geologist until 1935 when he finally decided to attend the Conservatory where he studied composition with Mikhail Gnesin following his attendance at a piano concert by Soviet pianist Emil Gilels. After graduating, he worked as a composer until the onset of World War II, when he enlisted in the Soviet Army and served from 1941 to 1945. After the war, he returned to his pedagogical work, teaching at the Leningrad Conservatory from 1946 to 1951, as well as creative work and began to set poems by Blok and Yesenin relating to the war. Later on in his life, Salmanov set poems by Federico García Lorca and Pablo Neruda as well as by Soviet poets.

Salmanov&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 in D minor was written in 1952 and dedicated to the conductor Yevgeny Mravinsky, who would go on to record all of four of Salmanov&#x27;s symphonies. The work uses Slavic folk melodies and a motto theme heard at the beginning of the first movement recurs in the Finale. His Symphony No. 4 was likewise dedicated to Mravinsky.

He also taught at the Leningrad Conservatory, his alma mater.

<doc id="476666" wikidata="Q753556" url="?curid=476666" title="Lucky Strike">
<text>Lucky Strike is an American brand of cigarettes owned by the British American Tobacco group. Individual cigarettes of the brand are often referred to colloquially as &quot;Luckies.&quot;

== Name ==
Lucky Strike was introduced as a brand of plug tobacco (chewing tobacco bound together with molasses) by an American firm R.A. Patterson in 1871 and evolved into a cigarette by the early 1900s. The brand style name was inspired by the gold rushes of the era, and was intended to connote a top-quality blend.

An urban legend claims that the name is a reference to cannabis in some cigarette packs.

== History ==
The brand was first introduced by R. A. Patterson of Richmond, Virginia in 1871 as cut plug chewing tobacco and later as a cigarette. In 1905, the company was acquired by the American Tobacco Company.
In 1917, the brand debuted the slogan &quot;It&#x27;s Toasted&quot; to promote the manufacturing method of toasting — rather than sun drying — the tobacco. In an attempt to counter this popular campaign, competitor Camel took a different approach, claiming that Camel was a &quot;fresh cigarette never parched or toasted.&quot;

Lucky Strike&#x27;s association with radio programs began during the 1920s on NBC. By 1928, the bandleader and vaudeville producer B. A. Rolfe was performing on radio and recording as &quot;B.A. Rolfe and his Lucky Strike Orchestra&quot; for Edison Records. Aviatrix Amelia Earhart became the face of Lucky Strike cigarettes in 1928, claiming to have smoked Lucky Strikes on her flight from Canada to England. The copy of an advertisement at that time said, &quot;Lucky Strikes were the cigarettes carried on the &#x27;Friendship&#x27; when she crossed the Atlantic. They were smoked continuously from Trepassey to Wales. I think nothing else helped so much to lessen the strain for all of us.&quot;

In the late 1920s, the brand was sold as an avenue to thinness for women. One typical advertisement said, &quot;Reach for a Lucky instead of a sweet.&quot; Sales of Lucky Strikes increased by more than 300% during the first year of that advertising campaign. Sales went from 14 billion cigarettes in 1925 to 40 billion in 1930.
In the early 1930s, Al Jolson was also paid to endorse the brand; he called Lucky Strike &quot;The cigarette of the acting profession... the good old flavor of Luckies is as sweet and soothing as the best &#x27;Mammy&#x27; song ever written.&quot; In 1935, the American Tobacco Company began to sponsor &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;, featuring North Carolina tobacco auctioneer Lee Aubrey &quot;Speed&quot; Riggs (later, another tobacco auctioneer from Lexington, Kentucky, F. E. Boone, was added). The weekly radio show capitalized on the tobacco auction theme and each ended with the signature phrase &quot;Sold, American.&quot;

In 1934, Edward Bernays was asked to deal with women&#x27;s apparent reluctance to buy Lucky Strikes because their green and red package clashed with standard female fashions. When Bernays suggested changing the package to a neutral color, George Washington Hill, head of the American Tobacco Company, refused, citing the money that he had already spent millions advertising the package. Bernays then endeavored to make green a fashionable color. The centerpiece of his efforts was the Green Ball, a social event at the Waldorf Astoria, hosted by Narcissa Cox Vanderlip. The pretext for the ball and its unnamed underwriter was that all proceeds would go to charity. High society women would attend wearing green dresses. Manufacturers and clothing and accessories retailers were advised of the excitement growing around the color green. Intellectuals were enlisted to give highbrow talks on the theme of green. 
The company&#x27;s advertising campaign generally featured a theme that stressed the quality of the tobacco, claiming that the higher quality tobacco resulted in a cigarette with better flavor. This campaign included a series of advertisements using Hollywood actors as endorsers of Lucky Strike. For example, Douglas Fairbanks referenced its toasted tobacco as a distinguishing feature. 

In 1937–1938, American Tobacco paid $130,000 (US$3.2 million in 2019) to 16 Hollywood actors and actresses for their endorsement of Lucky Strike. The highest paid among the celebrities were Joan Crawford, Gary Cooper, Clark Gable, Myrna Loy, Robert Taylor, and Spencer Tracy, who were each paid $10,000 (roughly US$178,000 in 2019). 

&quot;Luckies&quot; were the cigarette of choice for famous smoker Bette Davis. Starting in the fall of 1944, Lucky Strike began sponsoring comedian Jack Benny&#x27;s radio and television show, &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, which was also introduced as &quot;The Lucky Strike Program&quot;.

The Lucky Strike signature dark-green pack was changed to white in 1942 in a famous advertising campaign that used the slogan &quot;Lucky Strike Green has gone to war.&quot; The company claimed the change was made because the copper used in the green coloring was needed for World War II, though, in reality, American Tobacco used chromium for the green ink and copper for the gold-colored trim. Supply of each was limited and the substitute materials made the packaging look drab, but attributing the package update to the war effort helped Lucky Strike appear more patriotic. Famed industrial designer Raymond Loewy was challenged by company president George Washington Hill to improve the existing green and red package with a $50,000 bet. Loewy changed the background from green to white, because market research suggested it had more appeal to female smokers while also cutting printing costs by eliminating the green dye. He also placed the Lucky Strike target logo on both sides of the package, a move that increased both visibility and sales. Hill paid off the bet. 

The message &quot;L.S./M.F.T.&quot; (&quot;Lucky Strike means fine tobacco&quot;) was introduced on the package in 1944.

Lucky Strike was one of the brands included in the C-rations provided to American troops during World War II. Each C-ration of the time included nine cigarettes of varying brands, because military leaders believed tobacco was essential to the morale of soldiers. The other cigarette brands included in the C-rations were Camel, Chelsea, Chesterfield, Craven &quot;A&quot;-Brand, Old Gold, Philip Morris, Player&#x27;s, Raleigh, and Wings. The practice of including cigarettes in field rations continued through the Korean and Vietnam Wars, ending in 1976 with the growing evidence that linked smoking to various health problems.

=== Post World War II ===

In 1978 and 1994, export and U.S. rights were purchased by Brown &amp; Williamson. In the 1960s, filtered styles were launched in addition to a mentholated version called &quot;Lucky Strike Green,&quot; &quot;green&quot; referring to menthol, and not to the package color. In late 2006, the &quot;Full Flavored&quot; and &quot;Light&quot; filtered varieties were discontinued in North America. However, Lucky Strike continued to have marketing and distribution support in territories controlled by British American Tobacco (BAT) as a global brand. Additionally, R. J. Reynolds continues to market the original, non-filtered Lucky Strikes in the United States. Lucky Strike currently has a small base of smokers.

In 2007, a new packaging of Lucky Strikes was released with a two-way opening that splits seven cigarettes from the rest. In that same year, the company used the world&#x27;s smallest man at the time, He Pingping, in their advertising campaigns.

In 2009, Lucky Strike Silver (the variety marketed as &quot;lighter&quot;) changed its UK pack from the quintessential red design to blue, albeit with a red outer covering around the packet.

In 2012 consumption of Lucky Strikes stood at 33 billion packets, up from 23 billion in 2007. The television series &quot;Mad Men&quot;, which featured Lucky Strike as a major client of the advertising firm Sterling Cooper and the cigarette of choice of Don Draper, was credited with inspiring the massive jump in sales.

In December 2020, Lucky Strike filtered cigarettes, both full-flavored and lights, plus full-flavored and light menthol versions, were reintroduced to the U.S. market.

==Sport sponsorship==

From 1972 until the team&#x27;s departure in 1975, Lucky Strike sponsored the Scuderia Scribante team, which was also known as &quot;Neville Lederle&quot; and &quot;Lucky Strike Racing&quot;. The cars, driven by Neville Lederle and Dave Charlton, were some of the first to be sponsored by a major tobacco company after the Lotus Team was sponsored by Gold Leaf in 1968, and Marlboro started sponsoring British Racing Motors in 1972 and later McLaren in 1974. The team mainly participated in the South African Grand Prix in Kyalami, but during the 1972 Formula One season, the team also participated in the French Grand Prix in Circuit de Charade, the British Grand Prix in Brands Hatch and the German Grand Prix at the old Nürburgring. After the retirement of the team, it took over 20 years before Lucky Strike participated in Formula 1 again with the British American Racing team.

As a result of British American Tobacco (BAT) buying out American Tobacco Company in 1976, Lucky Strike came under control of BAT. The company acquired Formula 1&#x27;s Tyrrell Racing team in 1997 and rebranded it as British American Racing the following year, sponsoring the team with its Lucky Strike and stablemate 555 brands. In the team&#x27;s début season, they originally wanted to brand Jacques Villeneuve&#x27;s car in the red and white Lucky Strike livery, while branding Ricardo Zonta&#x27;s car with the blue colors of 555. However, the FIA blocked the move, and the team were forced to run two similar liveries. They opted to have the Lucky Strike livery on the left hand side of the car and the 555 livery on the right hand side, with a zip going up in the middle of the nose. From 2000 on, the team solely used Lucky Strike branding. The team was bought outright by partners Honda by 2006, though Lucky Strike continued to sponsor the team until the end of that year. For races where tobacco branding was not allowed, the Lucky Strike logo was blocked out (from 1999 to 2004), replaced by &quot;Run Free&quot; on other parts of the car (in 1999), changed to &quot;Look Alike&quot; (from 2000 to 2003), to a barcode with Formula One car (in 2003–2004), to &quot;Look Left,&quot; &quot;Look Right,&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Walk&quot; (in 2004), and &quot;Racing Revolution&quot; (in 2005–2006).

Lucky Strike was also the prime sponsor of the Suzuki MotoGP team from the 1990 season until the 1997 season. American motorcycle racer Kevin Schwantz became the 1993 world champion riding the Lucky Strike-sponsored Suzuki RGV500, with riders including Doug Chandler, Alex Barros and Daryl Beattie taking various podiums and wins on the Lucky Strike Suzuki as well.

==In popular culture==

=== In art ===
* American Colonial-Cubist artist Stuart Davis represented the brand in his 1921 painting, &quot;Lucky Strike&quot;

== Controversies ==

=== Lawsuits ===
In 1996, Brown &amp; Williamson, the makers of Lucky Strike, were ordered to pay $750,000 to a Florida resident who had developed lung cancer after having smoked cigarettes for 44 years. The jury found Brown &amp; Williamson guilty of manufacturing a defective product, and of engaging in misleading advertising by not warning people about the health danger associated with their product. 

In 1998, Brown &amp; Williamson again found liable to pay $950,000 in damages to the relatives of a Florida resident who had died from lung cancer. The jury found that the company had conspired with other tobacco companies to hide the health risks of smoking cigarettes. According to the Tampa Bay Times, this lawsuit marked &quot;the first time a tobacco company has been ordered to pay punitive damages intended to punish and deter wrongdoing because cigarettes are inherently dangerous&quot;.

==Cigarette camp==
&quot;Lucky Strike&quot; was the name of one of a number of temporary U.S. Army &quot;Tent cities&quot; known as Cigarette Camps situated around the French port of Le Havre following its capture in the wake of the Allied Normandy landings in mid-1944.

<doc id="476670" wikidata="Q1324020" url="?curid=476670" title="El Comercio (Peru)">
<text> is a Peruvian newspaper based in Lima. Founded in 1839, it is the oldest newspaper in Peru and one of the oldest Spanish-language papers in the world. It has a daily circulation of more than 120,000. It is considered a newspaper of record and one of the most influential media in Peru.

==History==
===19th century===

&quot;El Comercio&quot; began as a commercial, political and literary newspaper. Its first publication was on Saturday, May 4, 1839 by José Manuel Amunátegui y Muñoz (Chile, — Lima ) and Alejandro Villota (Buenos Aires, — Paris, ). It was originally a one-sheet afternoon newspaper printed on both sides in tabloid format. The price of the first edition was one silver real. Its motto was &quot;Order, freedom, knowledge.&quot; In total there were ten people who prepared the first issue. Printing was made on a handlebar &quot;Scott&quot; flatbed press, powered by a mule-driven winch.

Its first headquarters was the Casa de la Pila, located at Calle del Arzobispo No. 147 (current block 2 of Jr. Junín). Twenty-four days later it moved to Calle de San Pedro No. 63 (current block 3 of the Jr. Ucayali), both in the Cercado de Lima.

On August 9, 1839, the diary was published with four pages. Also in that month, its morning edition was launched and its afternoon edition was renamed from &quot;vespertina&quot; to &quot;de la tarde&quot;, remaining as such for a little more than 120 years. At the end of 1841, the newspaper moved to a farm located on the corner formed by the streets of San Antonio and La Rifa. Seventy-eight years later, this old house was demolished to make way for the new location on the corner of the current Lampa and Santa Rosa streets in the historic centre of Lima. In 1855, he acquired his first &quot;Marinoni&quot; reaction press, which was powered by steam and produced just over a thousand copies per hour.

On January 1, 1867, José Antonio Miró Quesada (Panama City, — Lima, ) began working at the newspaper as a correspondent in Callao at the age of twenty-two. In 1875, Manuel Amunátegui gave control of the newspaper to and José Antonio Miró Quesada, who formed the company &quot;Carranza, Miró Quesada y Compañía&quot;. They established in the act of incorporation that, after the death of the first of them, the surviving partner could purchase the company&#x27;s shares without the family of the deceased having any other right than to receive the respective financial compensation.

Between January 16, 1880 and October 23, 1884, &quot;El Comercio&quot; stopped publishing as a consequence of the closure ordered by Nicolás de Piérola and the subsequent occupation of Lima by the Chilean Army during the War of the Pacific.

After Carranza&#x27;s death in 1898, Miró Quesada acquired the shares and since then the Miró Quesada family has controlled the newspaper.

===20th century===

At the beginning of the 20th century, &quot;El Comercio&quot; would become the most influential newspaper in the country, whose Miró Quesada family was the most powerful at that time.

On January 19, 1902, the newspaper inaugurated its first &quot;Marinoni&quot; electric rotary press and its new stereotyping workshop, based on the use of movable typographic characters which, in October 1904, was complemented with the entry into operation of the first linotypes that were used in Peru, being the third newspaper in South America to implement it.

On January 21, 1917, a modern &quot;Goss&quot; rotary press was put into operation, with which thirty-two page copies could be printed, and the printing workshops were expanded. By 1922, it reached 40 thousand editions. On May 4, 1924, the traditional headquarters were inaugurated in the same location on the corner of Jr. Lampa and jr. Miró Quesada (today Santa Rosa) in the historic center of Lima.

On July 3, 1928, José Antonio Miró Quesada, by public deed, established a public limited company with his children called &quot;Empresa Editora El Comercio S. A.&quot; This is how his son Antonio Miró Quesada de la Guerra would later assume management of the newspaper, who, together with his wife, was murdered by an Aprista Party member on May 15, 1935, when they were walking to lunch at the National Club. He was later succeeded as director of &quot;El Comercio&quot; by several members of the Miró Quesada family. In the 1930s, Carlos Miró-Quesada Laos served as director of the newspaper and was a proponent for fascism in Peru.

On March 3, 1951, in response to competition from other newspapers and new media such as radio broadcasting, it was the first Peruvian newspaper to implement the use of the radio photo system and shortly after, on August 5, 1952, it put into operation a modern &quot;Westrex Divatel&quot; teletype that captured 3,600 words per hour. which allowed the newspaper to report current events in the world as a scoop a few hours after they occurred with their corresponding photograph. On March 29, 1953, El Comercio became the first Peruvian newspaper to publish a cultural section as a specialised Sunday supplement. Previously, cultural pages were published on Saturdays. On May 2, 1959, the last front page of the newspaper with advertisements was published. On May 4 of the same year (anniversary date), the first morning edition was published with a completely news cover and a renewed design that would remain for twenty-four years.

Despite this, the publishing company entered into conflict with its workers; amid accusations of difficult working conditions, some were fired.

In 1962, &quot;El Comercio Gráfico&quot; was launched to replace the newspaper&#x27;s evening edition. In July 1966, the &quot;Hoe Colormatic&quot; rotary press was inaugurated, releasing up to seventy thousand copies per hour and allowing the newspaper to publish color photographs. In 1971, &quot;El Comercio Gráfico&quot; was cancelled and replaced by the sports newspaper &quot;Aficción&quot;, which only existed for a few years.

The military government of Juan Velasco Alvarado expropriated the newspapers on July 28, 1974 (Decree-Law No. 20 681). So, &quot;El Comercio&quot; was theoretically dedicated to serving the peasant communities, but in practice it became a spokesperson for the regime. Héctor Cornejo Chávez, president of the Christian Democratic Party and supporter of Velasco, was appointed as director. This expropriation was signed by one of the family members: , who at that time was Minister of Health. The Peruvian media were returned to their rightful owners by President Fernando Belaúnde Terry on July 28, 1980, the same day he assumed office. The management of &quot;El Comercio&quot; was assumed by and .

At the beginning of 1982, &quot;El Comercio&quot; began the progressive change of the old linotype editing systems and began to be designed using computers, a transition successfully completed on November 23, 1983 with the adoption of an electronic photocomposition system. On June 28, 1984, he inaugurated a large printing plant in the Pueblo Libre district on an area of eighteen thousand m2 with a new rotary offset press &quot;M.A.N. Roland Lithomatic II&quot; with the ability to print the journal completely in colour.

Also in 1984, the &quot;School Page&quot; section was created, where journalistic articles by hundreds of schoolchildren from all over Peru began to be published. Although no longer in the printed version, the School Correspondents program continues with teaching and training in journalistic training topics for young schoolchildren.

In the mid-1990s, a new computerised publishing and digital pre-press system was implemented, in which it experimented with Infobanco, its subscription information service. In 1996 it was agreed to purchase 15% of Telefónica del Perú. On January 15, 1997, &quot;El Comercio&quot; launched its internet website. Also in that year, the printing plant was modernised with the acquisition of a new &quot;Goss Newsliner&quot; rotary press that was added to the previous one. All of which allowed &quot;El Comercio&quot; to have, since January 19, 1999, an avant-garde design in a slightly smaller size although still maintaining the traditional large format that it had used since the mid-19th century.

In 1998, the newspaper established its writing and style manual. Between November 1999 and February 2000, the company underwent a restructuring to save costs of up to one million dollars annually.

==== Team of Ricardo Uceda ====
In 1994, Ricardo Uceda resigned as editor-in-chief of &quot;Sí&quot; to form a special investigative team at . As with Uceda&#x27;s &quot;Sí&quot; reporting, the &quot;Comercio&quot; team focused on cases of governmental corruption. One their most notable successes came in 1998, when they exposed the misuse of state funds intended for the survivors of floods and mudslides induced by the 1997-98 El Niño event; the story resulted in the arrest and imprisonment of Civil Defence Chief General Homero Nureña.

===21st century===
The newspaper is owned by shareholders of the Miró Quesada family, whose ownership of the company dates to 1875. Despite this, management is under control of an individual who is not a member of the family.

The company has ownership over its subsidiaries, the newspapers &quot;Peru 21&quot; and &quot;Trome&quot;, and the magazine &quot;Somos&quot;.

The corporation, Empresa Editora El Comercio S.A., is the product of the merging of many companies in 1996. The company manages the editing, publication, and distribution of the newspaper, , as well as the publication and distribution of &quot;Trome&quot;, &quot;Peru 21&quot;, and &quot;Gestion&quot;. In addition, they manage the advertising aspects of the mentioned publications. Additionally, they are devoted to the editing, publication, and distribution of many other books, magazines, pamphlets, weeklies, all sorts of graphic publications, Multimedia products, and videography. Informational content is distributed by their subsidiary Orbis Ventures S.A.C., a company in charge of the administration of the company&#x27;s website.

The legal address of the company, where their administrative offices were in 300 Jr. Santa Rosa, Lima, Lima, Peru. Their publishing factories, Pando and Amauta, are in the districts of Pueblo Libre and the Cercado of Lima.

The new legal address is in 171 Av. Jorge Salazar Araoz, La Victoria, Lima.

Financially, the company operates very independently, as the effects of consolidation have not in large part affected the operation of their subsidiaries, Orbis Ventures S.A.C., Zetta Comunicadores del Perú S.A.E.M.A., EC Jobs S.A.C., Punto y Coma Editores S.A.C., Suscripciones Integrales S.A.C., Amauta Impressiones Comerciales, Producciones Cantabria S.A.C., Inmobiliaria El Sol S.A. and Grupo PluralTV.

==Political alignment==
The newspaper has been described as conservative and holding an ideological position is center-right. Barnhurst described &quot;El Comercio&quot; as &quot;the most conservative newspaper&quot; in Peru in a review of the media in the nation. According to Wayka, Elisabeth Dulanto Baquerizo de Miró Quesada, a member of the Miró Quesada family which owns El Comercio Group, signed the Madrid Charter and has helped hold events for the anti-leftist organization Madrid Forum, a group that was organized by the far-right Spanish party Vox.

<doc id="476675" wikidata="Q300846" url="?curid=476675" title="Patch (Unix)">
<text>The computer tool patch is a Unix program that updates text files according to instructions contained in a separate file, called a &quot;patch file&quot;. The patch file (also called a &quot;patch&quot; for short) is a text file that consists of a list of differences and is produced by running the related diff program with the original and updated file as arguments. Updating files with patch is often referred to as &quot;applying the patch&quot; or simply &quot;patching&quot; the files.

==History==
The original patch program was written by Larry Wall (who went on to create the Perl programming language) and posted to codice_1 (which later became codice_2) in May 1985.

patch was added to XPG4, which later became POSIX. Wall&#x27;s code remains the basis of &quot;patch&quot; programs provided in OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and schilytools. The Open Software Foundation, which merged into The Open Group, is said to have maintained a derived version.

The GNU project/FSF maintains its patch, forked from the Larry Wall version. The repository is different from that of GNU diffutils, but the documentation is managed together.

==Usage context==
Developed by a programmer for other programmers, patch was frequently used for updating source code to a newer version. Because of this, many people came to associate patches with source code, whereas patches can in fact be applied to any text. &quot;Patched&quot; files do not accumulate any unneeded text, which is what some people perceive based on the English meaning of the word; patch is as capable of removing text as it is of adding it. 

Patches described here should not be confused with binary patches, which, although can be conceptually similar, are distributed to update binary files comprising the program to a new release.

==Patches in software development==
The diff files that serve as input to patch are readable text files, which means that they can be easily reviewed or modified by humans before use.

In addition to the &quot;diff&quot; program, diffs can also be produced by other programs, such as Subversion, CVS, RCS, Mercurial and Git.

Patches have been the crucial component of many source control systems, including CVS.

===Advanced diffs===

When more advanced diffs are used, patches can be applied even to files that have been modified in the meantime, as long as those modifications do not interfere with the patch. This is achieved by using &quot;context diffs&quot; and &quot;unified diffs&quot; (also known as &quot;unidiffs&quot;), which surround each change with &quot;context&quot;, which is the text immediately before and after the changed part. Patch can then use this context to locate the region to be patched even if it has been displaced by changes earlier in the file, using the line numbers in the diffs as a starting point. Because of this property, context and unified diffs are the preferred form of patches for submission to many software projects.

The above features make diff and patch especially popular for exchanging modifications to open-source software. Outsiders can download the latest publicly available source code, make modifications to it, and send them, in diff form, to the development team. Using diffs, the development team has the ability to effectively review the patches before applying them, and can apply them to a newer code base than the one the outside developer had access to.

==Usage examples==
To create a patch, one could run the following command in a shell:

$ diff -u oldFile newFile &gt; mods.diff # -u tells diff to output unified diff format

To apply a patch, one could run the following command in a shell:
$ patch &lt; mods.diff
This tells patch to apply the changes to the specified files described in codice_3. Patches to files in subdirectories require the additional codice_4 option, where &quot;number&quot; is 1 if the base directory of the source tree is included in the diff, and 0 otherwise.

Patches can be undone, or reversed, with the &#x27;codice_5&#x27; option:
$ patch -R &lt; mods.diff
In some cases when the file is not identical to the version the diff was generated against, the patch will not be able to be applied cleanly. For example, if lines of text are inserted at the beginning, the line numbers referred to in the patch will be incorrect. patch is able to recover from this, by looking at nearby lines to relocate the text to be patched. It will also recover when lines of context (for context and unified diffs) are altered; this is described as fuzz.

==Ports of patch==
Originally written for Unix and Unix-like systems, patch has also been ported to Windows and many other platforms. Windows ports of patch are provided by GnuWin32 and UnxUtils.

A codice_6 command is also part of ASCII&#x27;s &quot;MSX-DOS2 Tools&quot; for MSX-DOS version 2.

<text>Hildegard Martha Lächert (19 March 1920 – 14 April 1995) was a female guard, or &quot;Aufseherin&quot;, at several concentration camps controlled by Nazi Germany. She became publicly known for her service at Ravensbrück, Majdanek and Auschwitz-Birkenau.

== Early life ==
Lächert became a mother aged 18 and again aged 23, both children conceived in non-marital relationships.

== Camp service ==
In October 1942, at the age of 22, Lächert, a German nurse, was called to serve at Majdanek as an &quot;Aufseherin&quot;. During her time in Majdanek, Lächert was recalled as having been extremely brutal. Lächert was disciplined by her SS superiors at least three times, albeit all for administrative offensives. She spent five days in jail for violating a curfew, and another eight days in jail for losing her pistol. 

In 1944, after the birth of her third child, Lächert served at Auschwitz concentration camp. She fled the camp in December 1944 ahead of the advancing Red Army. There are reports that her last overseeing jobs were at Bozen, a detention camp in northern Italy, and at the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in Austria.

In July 1945, Lächert, whose crimes had not been discovered yet, returned to Berlin and worked in an American hospital until October, after which she returned to Austria to continue nursing. On 30 March 1946, Austrian police officers arrested Lächert since she had previously worked with the SS. She was transferred to British custody, and then extradited to Poland in December.

== Trial ==
In November 1947, the former member of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) appeared in a Kraków, Poland courtroom, along with 40 other SS guards in the Auschwitz trial. Lächert sat next to three other former SS women, Alice Orlowski, Therese Brandl, and Luise Danz. Because of her war crimes in Auschwitz and Płaszów, the former guard and mother of two surviving children was given a sentence of 15 years in prison. Lächert was released from prison under an amnesty on 7 December 1956. Lächert subsequently received 6000 DM from the West German government as an alleged prisoner of war. After her release, Lächert briefly worked with the Federal Intelligence Service (BND), West German spy agency and the CIA, which at the time was routinely interviewing Nazi war criminals who had been released from prisons in Eastern Europe. Lächert&#x27;s work with the agencies ended after only a few months since she was quickly deemed useless.

In August 1973, Lächert was arrested by West German officials, and questioned about her past in Majdanek, due to the upcoming third Majdanek Trial. Lächert was released, but then rearrested as a suspect in June 1979 and put on trial. The same year, she ran in the European Parliament election for Erwin Schönborn&#x27;s far-right Aktionsgemeinschaft Nationales Europa in the European elections, placing 4th on the group&#x27;s list.

The testimonies heard concerning Lächert&#x27;s sadistic behaviour were extensive and detailed. One former prisoner, Henryka Ostrowska, testified, &quot;We always said &quot;blutige&quot; about the fact that she struck until blood showed,&quot; giving her the nickname &quot;Bloody Brigitte&quot; (&quot;Krwawa Brygida&quot; in Polish). Many other witnesses characterized her as the &quot;worst of the worst&quot; or &quot;the most cruel&quot; &quot;Aufseherin&quot;, as &quot;Beast&quot;, and as &quot;Fright of the Prisoners.&quot; Another survivor, Maria Kaufmann-Krasowski, testified that when Lächert assigned her to wash floors she beat her with a whip and referred to her as &quot;a piece of filth.&quot; For her part in selections to the gas chamber, complicity to the murder of 1196 prisoners, releasing her dog onto pregnant inmates (in one example ‘targeting the most vulnerable parts of her body in an act of cruel desecration and killing of her unborn child’) and her overall abuse, the court sentenced her to 12 years imprisonment in the Majdanek trials. Prosecutors had requested a life sentence. 

Lächert never had to serve this time, since her imprisonment in Poland and the time she spent in custody awaiting trial were allowed as time served. She died in 1995.

<doc id="476679" wikidata="Q7055001" url="?curid=476679" title="North Dakota Democratic–Nonpartisan League Party">
<text>The North Dakota Democratic–Nonpartisan League Party (abbreviated Democratic-NPL or simply D-NPL) is the North Dakota affiliate of the national Democratic Party. It was formed as the outcome of a merger of two parties; the state previously had a three-party political system. It is one of only two state Democratic Party affiliates to have a different name from the central party, the other is the neighboring Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party.

==History==
The North Dakota Democratic–Nonpartisan League Party has roots in the Progressive Era of American history. At the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, progressives – including lawyers, merchants, editors, and professors – joined both the Republican Party, which had strong control of state politics, as well as the state Democratic Party, the progressive faction of which called itself &quot;the party of the laborer and the farmer.&quot; Although they did not alter the control of the Republican Party during this era, progressives found support in the Norwegian-settled state, especially in the east. By 1906, progressive sympathies were growing in opposition to what most saw as complete control of state politics by the railway companies. The initial organization and calls for reform laid a foundation that would soon grow into a statewide socialist workers&#x27; movement that eventually spread throughout the Midwest.

===1906 through 1915===
The prewar decade was marked by a series of progressive successes, starting with progressive Democrat John Burke&#x27;s election as governor in 1906. Republican Alexander McKenzie&#x27;s conservative political machine still controlled the Senate, but the House of Representatives was filled with progressive Democrats and Republicans, who managed to introduce many anti-railroad bills despite staunch opposition by lobbyists. Progressive reforms and legislation were passed during this time, including a direct primary law, a joint resolution for a constitutional amendment for initiative and referendum power, a public library commission law, and laws to enforce prohibition. Subsequent years would see the end of Alexander McKenzie and his Republican political machine. By 1908, the first State electoral primaries solidified his retirement. That year the Republican Party, free from McKenzie&#x27;s conservative influence, crafted a progressive party platform. Progressive Democratic Governor John Burke enjoyed support of progressive Republicans.

North Dakota again demonstrated its progressive sympathies in 1912, when the state held the first United States Presidential Preference Primary on March 19. North Dakota Republicans favored progressive presidential candidate Robert M. La Follette over Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft. Though an angry Roosevelt formed the Progressive Party after losing the Republican nomination to Taft, he had little support from North Dakota, where many Progressives distrusted his backers, George Walbridge Perkins of the J. P. Morgan group and International Harvester. Because of such opposition, Woodrow Wilson carried the state in November. Republican Louis B. Hanna was elected governor in 1912 and 1914. Once in office, he and his legislative allies halted the creation of a state-operated grain elevator, which may have convinced progressives to unite in 1915.

===Rise of the Nonpartisan League===

When Arthur C. Townley came to Bismarck, North Dakota, in 1915, he saw strife between a conservative legislature and farmers&#x27; interest groups. With his background in organizing farmers for the Socialist Party (socialist activity had begun in North Dakota in 1900 when Arthur Basset organized a socialist club in Fargo), Townley brought his expertise to North Dakota. He knew that with the recent strife in Bismarck between a conservative legislature and the American Society of Equity and its farm following, the time was ripe for a political revolution. Townley resolved to organize the farmers so that they could control the primaries, whether it be Republicans or Democrats or both. This was the organization of the Farmers Nonpartisan League (later called the National Nonpartisan League). Townley organized the farmers of the state together for united action in nominating at the primaries and electing at the polls the men of their own choosing and men who would carry out their programs.

The method of organization was simple, scientific and successful. Organizers carefully went forth in ever increasing numbers to sell the idea to the farmers and to get their support for the new movement. The league grew quickly. The first members were pledged in February 1915. Before midsummer, there were 10,000 members, and before winter set in, there were 26,000 names enrolled.

The Nonpartisan League membership pledge was $2.50 a year; it later rose to $9 a year. The goals of the league were to use their collective best efforts to secure the nomination and election of men for office within the state who would support legislation to save millions of dollars each year for farmers.

The League program consisted of five planks:

# State-owned and operated elevators, flour mills, and packing plants
# State hail insurance
# Exemption of farm improvements from taxation
# Fair grain grades, based upon milling and baking values
# Rural credits at cost

Each was designed to remedy what the farmers conceived as an abuse, and each was to lower the cost of producing and marketing grain.

The determination of the league fulfilled their pledge and many of their planks passed legislation. The growth of far-left sympathies was on the rise in North Dakota. The Socialists had considerable success. They brought in many outside speakers; Eugene V. Debs spoke at a large antiwar rally at Garrison in 1915. By 1912, there were 175 Socialist locals in the state. Rugby and Hillsboro elected Socialist mayors. The party established a weekly paper, the &quot;Iconoclast&quot;, in Minot, North Dakota.

Throughout the decades, the League pushed for the establishments of state-operated mills, elevators, and banks. The state was not entirely isolationist, just as it was neither entirely liberal nor entirely conservative. By 1952, the Nonpartisan League was itself divided.

===Toward a two-party system===
Two factions divided the traditionally liberal Nonpartisan League: on one side the insurgents, on the other, the old guard. Those that called themselves insurgents aligned liberally with pro-farmers&#x27; union, pro-organized labor, and pro-Democratic party groups. The insurgents wanted to take the league into the Democratic Party. In 1952, the insurgents formed the Volunteers for Stevenson Committee, to help elect then Democratic Candidate Adlai Stevenson. To the contrary the members of the old guard, also known as the Capitol Crowd, were more conservative, anti-farmers&#x27; union, anti-labor, and pro-Republican segment of the league, these members wanted to keep the Nonpartisan League in the Republican Party; they supported Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1952 presidential race. Over the next four years legislative polarization grew and the Nonpartisan League eventually split in two; in 1956 North Dakota was fundamentally realigned into a two-party system. That year, the Nonpartisan League finally moved into the Democratic Party, and all Republicans joined in one organization. Two statewide parties vied for the votes of North Dakota citizens. Creation of the Democratic–Nonpartisan League Party was codified in March during the League Convention; 173 to 3 voted yes to file candidates in the Democratic column. The new party introduced a full slate of candidates for state office and adopted a liberal platform that included the repeal of the Taft–Hartley Act, creation of a $1.25 an hour minimum wage, and a graduated land tax on property worth $20,000 or more. Two months later in May 1956 the Democratic Convention accepted the Nonpartisan League&#x27;s candidates and adopted its platform. Republicans in North Dakota also united after conservative supports broke away from the league.

The Executive Committee of the NPL still formally exists within the party structure of the North Dakota Democratic–NPL. It was at one point headed by former State Senator &quot;Buckshot&quot; Hoffner (D-NPL, Esmond), Chairman, and former Lt. Governor Lloyd Omdahl, Secretary.

Although the Democratic Party was still the minority, the number of Democrats in the state legislature increased greatly. Before the league moved into the Democratic Party, there were only five Democrats among the 162 members of both houses of the legislature in 1955. In 1957, the number grew to 28. By 1959, the numbers continued to grow reaching 67, despite dropping to 62 members in 1961. Nevertheless, for the first time in history, North Dakota was becoming a two-party state.

==Recent events==
North Dakota has one of the lowest unemployment rates of all 50 states. The Nonpartisan League laid a foundation of enriched public ownership and responsibility in such institutions as a state bank. One study has drawn conclusions that publicly operated institutions such as the state bank have helped North Dakota weather economic storms.

The Bank of North Dakota was created to address market failures associated with monopoly power among large financial and business institutions in the early twentieth century. This market power meant that small farming operations had inadequate access to credit. One of the goals of the Nonpartisan League was to remedy limited access to credit by establishing this institution. A measure of the public good brought about by the Bank&#x27;s establishment that still stands today is what some have identified as the Bank&#x27;s role in reducing the impact of economic recession. The public-private relationship establishes roles assigned according to what each sector does best, allowing the mutual benefit of public and private banks balancing out inequality and building equality, thus creating an economic safety net for North Dakota citizens. These early roots of the Democratic-Nonpartisan League party have been celebrated for establishing a foundation that rights the state in times of national crisis and provides economic security to generations of the state&#x27;s farmers.

<doc id="476686" wikidata="Q50597" url="?curid=476686" title="Heidi Heitkamp">
<text>Mary Kathryn&quot;Heidi&quot;Heitkamp (, ; born October 30, 1955) is an American lawyer and politician who served as a United States senator from North Dakota from 2013 to 2019. A member of the North Dakota Democratic–Nonpartisan League Party, she was the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from North Dakota. Heitkamp served as the 20th North Dakota tax commissioner from 1986 to 1992 and as the 28th North Dakota attorney general from 1992 to 2000. , she is the last Democrat to hold or win statewide and/or congressional office in North Dakota.

Heitkamp ran for governor of North Dakota in 2000 and lost to Republican John Hoeven. She considered a bid for the Democratic nomination in the 2010 U.S. Senate election to replace the retiring Byron Dorgan, but on March 3, 2010, declined to run against Hoeven, who was ultimately elected.

In November 2011, Heitkamp declared her candidacy to replace the retiring Kent Conrad as U.S. senator from North Dakota in the 2012 election. She narrowly defeated Republican Congressman Rick Berg on November 6, 2012, in that year&#x27;s closest Senate race. Heitkamp was North Dakota&#x27;s second female senator, after Jocelyn Burdick, and the first woman to be elected to the Senate from the state. On November 6, 2018, Republican congressman Kevin Cramer defeated Heitkamp in her bid for reelection. After leaving the Senate, Heitkamp became a CNBC contributor and visiting fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School&#x27;s Institute of Politics. In April 2019, with Senator Joe Donnelly of Indiana (who also lost reelection in 2018), she launched One Country Project, an organization aimed at helping Democrats reconnect with rural voters. In January 2023, Heitkamp became the director of the University of Chicago Institute of Politics.

==Early life and education==

Heitkamp was born in Breckenridge, Minnesota, the fourth of seven children of Doreen LaVonne (née Berg), a school cook, and Raymond Bernard Heitkamp, a janitor and construction worker. Her father was of German descent, her mother of half Norwegian and half German ancestry. Heitkamp was raised in Mantador, North Dakota, attending local public schools. She adopted the nickname &quot;Heidi&quot; in first grade to distinguish herself from two other classmates named Mary and Kathy. She earned a B.A. from the University of North Dakota in 1977 and a J.D. from Lewis &amp; Clark Law School in 1980.

== Early career ==
Heitkamp interned for the United States Congress in 1976 and in the North Dakota Legislative Assembly in 1977.

===Practicing attorney and politics===
In 1980 and 1981, Heitkamp worked as an attorney for the Environmental Protection Agency. She next worked as an attorney for North Dakota State Tax Commissioner Kent Conrad.

She also became active in politics, joining the North Dakota Democratic–Nonpartisan League Party. In 1984, Heitkamp ran for state Auditor and lost to incumbent Republican Robert W. Peterson. In 1986, Kent Conrad resigned as tax commissioner after his election to the U.S. Senate. North Dakota Governor George A. Sinner appointed Heitkamp tax commissioner before she ran for the office and was elected with 66% of the vote against Republican Marshall Moore. She served in that position until 1992.

===North Dakota attorney general===
In 1992, the incumbent North Dakota attorney general, Nick Spaeth, retired in order to run for governor. Heitkamp ran for attorney general and won with 62% of the vote. She was reelected in 1996 with 64% of the vote.

As attorney general of North Dakota, Heitkamp became known for leading the state&#x27;s legal efforts to seek damages from tobacco companies, eventually resulting in the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement.

===2000 gubernatorial election===
In 2000, incumbent Republican governor Ed Schafer decided not to seek a third term. Heitkamp ran unopposed in the Democratic primary. On the Republican side, John Hoeven, CEO of the Bank of North Dakota, also ran unopposed. During her campaign for governor, it was announced that Heitkamp had been diagnosed with breast cancer, which later went into remission. Hoeven defeated her, 55% to 45%. Heitkamp won 12 of the state&#x27;s 53 counties.

===Business===
From 2001 to 2012, Heitkamp served as an external director on the Dakota Gasification Company&#x27;s Great Plains synfuels plant&#x27;s board of directors. She now serves on the advisory board of the Canadian American Business Council.

Heitkamp&#x27;s brother, Joel, is a radio talk-show host and former North Dakota state senator. Heitkamp has occasionally filled in as host of his program, &quot;News and Views&quot;, which is broadcast on KFGO in Fargo and other stations in North Dakota.

==U.S. Senate==

===Elections===

==== 2012 ====
In January 2011, incumbent Democratic U.S. senator Kent Conrad announced he would not seek reelection in 2012. On November 8, 2011, Heitkamp announced that she would seek the open seat. She vowed to be &quot;an independent voice&quot;.

Heitkamp won the November 6, 2012, Senate election by 2,936 votes, less than 1% of the ballots cast. Berg conceded the race the next day, though he could have asked for a &quot;demand recount&quot; under North Dakota law.

In 2014, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; suggested that Heitkamp might be a presidential contender in 2020, writing that she had come to Washington &quot;personifying traditional values of the Old West: candor, consistency, hard work, and a sense of good faith and fair play.&quot;

In December 2016, it was reported that President-elect Donald Trump was considering Heitkamp for Secretary of Agriculture. In response, Heitkamp said on the radio that she would likely refuse any such offer. &quot;I&#x27;m not saying &#x27;never, never,&#x27; but I will tell you that I&#x27;m very, very honored to serve the people of North Dakota and I hope that no matter what I do, that will always be my first priority...The job that I have right now is incredibly challenging. I love it.&quot; Trump eventually nominated former Georgia governor Sonny Perdue for the job.

Heitkamp represented North Dakota in the Senate from January 3, 2013 to January 3, 2019, alongside Republican John Hoeven, her former opponent in the governor&#x27;s race.

==== 2018 ====


On September 13, 2017, a day after dining at the White House with several other senators and Trump, Heitkamp announced she would seek a second term. She spoke of the importance of legislation regarding infrastructure, tax reform, and energy and farm policy. Representative Kevin Cramer won the Republican primary to challenge Heitkamp.

In October 2018, Heitkamp apologized after her campaign ran a newspaper advertisement that &quot;included names of victims of domestic violence, sexual assault or rape without their permission.&quot;

On November 6, 2018, Cramer defeated Heitkamp with 55.4% of the vote, despite raising $22 million less than her.

==Later career==

Heitkamp is a contributor to CNBC. In the 2020 presidential election, she was on North Dakota&#x27;s Democratic-NPL elector slate for Joe Biden. Trump won the state&#x27;s three electoral votes. In 2020, she was named a potential candidate for Secretary of Agriculture in the Biden Administration. Biden ultimately chose Tom Vilsack, who had previously held the position under President Barack Obama.

In 2021, Heitkamp lobbied against Democratic Party efforts to raise taxes on corporations, large inheritances and the superwealthy to pay for a $3.5 trillion social spending bill. The lobbyist John Breaux recruited her to advocate against taxation of large inheritances.

In October 2022, Heitkamp was named director of the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago in Chicago, IL, after previously serving there as a Pritzker Fellow.

Heitkamp is a board member for American Edge, a lobbying organization for the technology industry, and Norfolk Southern.

==Political positions==
Heitkamp has been described as a moderate Democrat. She was considered a centrist and often supported bipartisan legislation. The &quot;National Journal&quot; has given her a composite rating of 53% liberal and 47% conservative. The American Conservative Union gives her a lifetime 13.67% conservative rating. The fiscally conservative group Americans for Prosperity gives Heitkamp a lifetime score of 26% and a higher score of 70% in 2016. Americans for Democratic Action, which supports liberal positions, gave her a score of 45% liberal in 2016 and 60% liberal in 2015. According to FiveThirtyEight, Heitkamp voted in line with Trump&#x27;s positions over 54% of the time. &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot; published a study finding that she voted with Trump&#x27;s position 67% of the time. The Associated Press found that she voted with his positions more than 68% of the time. In 2018, GovTrack placed Heitkamp near the center of the Senate as the third-most moderate Democrat, to the right of moderate Republican senator Susan Collins.

In March 2018, Heitkamp co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (s. 720), which would have made it a federal crime for American contractors to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government.

In June 2018, Americans for Prosperity, which is backed by the Koch brothers, ran digital advertisements thanking Heitkamp for her vote to pass legislation loosening financial regulations on banks.

===Healthcare===
Heitkamp has said that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act contains &quot;good and bad&quot; elements and that &quot;it needs to be fixed.&quot; She criticized her Senate race opponent Rick Berg for wanting to repeal the law, citing concerns about insurance companies denying coverage to children with preexisting conditions.

During the United States federal government shutdown of 2013, Heitkamp criticized Republican attempts to use the Continuing Appropriations Resolution as &quot;a vehicle to legislate other issues,&quot; such as the defunding of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a delay of its individual mandate. She was one of 14 members of the bipartisan Senate group that negotiated the compromise that was the basis of the eventual deal to end the shutdown. During the 2013 government shutdown, Heitkamp donated about $8,000 of her salary to North Dakota charities that support veterans, provide healthcare supplies to those that cannot afford them, and raise breast cancer awareness.

In January 2018, Heitkamp was one of six Democrats to join Republican senators in voting to confirm Trump&#x27;s nominee for Health secretary, Alex Azar.

===Economic issues===
Heitkamp sought to get the Trump Administration &quot;to get the Export-Import Bank in high gear to help North Dakota&#x27;s economy.&quot;

Heitkamp said she would support a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution &quot;with exceptions&quot; if elected. She said the exceptions would include wartime spending, Social Security, Medicare, and a ban on tax cuts for those making more than $1 million per year.

Heitkamp announced in a 2012 campaign press release that she supports the Buffett Rule. She supports implementing the Buffett Rule via the Paying a Fair Share Act, which would require those making a gross income of $1 million or more to pay at least a 30% federal tax rate.

After Trump&#x27;s inauguration in 2017, Heitkamp was described as being &quot;under intense pressure from the president to defect to the tax reform cause.&quot; On December 1, 2017, she joined every Democrat and 14 House and Senate Republicans in voting against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

Heitkamp was described in 2017 as wanting &quot;to use her White House connections to prod Trump to take a softer view on trade&quot;.

&quot;Politico&quot; wrote in 2017 that Heitkamp &quot;hates the White House&#x27;s budget&#x27;s agriculture cuts and believes they&#x27;d devastate North Dakota&quot;.

Heitkamp was one of the chief architects of a bank deregulation bill that rolled back provisions of Dodd-Frank. Many progressives, most notably Elizabeth Warren, have urged her colleagues to oppose the bill. She was one of 17 Democrats who broke with the majority of their party and voted with Republicans to ease bank regulations. Trump invited Heitkamp to take part in the signing ceremony after the bill&#x27;s passage.

===Same-sex marriage===
On April 5, 2013, Heitkamp announced her support for same-sex marriage, along with fellow red state Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly, who entered the Senate at the same time Heitkamp did.

===Abortion===
When running for Senate in 2012, Heitkamp said she opposed public funding of abortions and believed that &quot;late term abortions should be illegal except when necessary to save the life of the mother.&quot; After her election, however, she voted to filibuster a bill that would have made abortions illegal after the fifth month of pregnancy except when the mother&#x27;s life is endangered. Heitkamp&#x27;s apparent shift led to criticism by Marjorie Dannenfelser of the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List.

Planned Parenthood, which supports legal abortion and reproductive rights, has given Heitkamp a 100% lifetime rating. She received a 100% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America, a 20% rating from the anti-abortion organization National Right to Life, and a 20% rating from Democrats for Life, a group of anti-abortion Democrats.

===Filibuster reform===
Heitkamp said she supports reforming the filibuster in the United States Senate, but did not endorse the proposal by Senators Ron Wyden and Tom Udall to do so.

===Support for Hillary Clinton===
Heitkamp was described in 2014 as a &quot;Hillary Clinton fan&quot; who believed Clinton would &quot;run, win, and be &#x27;an excellent president.&#x27;&quot; She said of Clinton, &quot;I think she transcends gender. When people look at her, they don&#x27;t see male or female. They see a very accomplished, qualified candidate. She&#x27;s very collaborative, very open to a different way of looking at things, uber smart. She digs down and understands an issue.&quot;

Heitkamp was less enthusiastic about Clinton by 2016, in light of her email controversy and what Heitkamp perceived as Clinton&#x27;s turn to the left. In 2018, when asked when Clinton would &quot;ride off into the sunset,&quot; Heitkamp replied, &quot;Not soon enough.&quot;

===Relationship with Donald Trump===
After the 2016 presidential election, in which Trump won North Dakota overwhelmingly, Heitkamp said she did not have to change her views to appeal to Trump supporters. In December 2016, she told Bloomberg News, &quot;Many of the people who voted for Donald Trump are the same voters from rural communities who I know, grew up with and work with every day.&quot; According to Bloomberg, Heitkamp &quot;hinted at a preference for Trump politicos over Washington ones because the former don&#x27;t &#x27;come as establishment Republicans,&#x27; but have a great &#x27;willingness to listen to a different perspective.&#x27;&quot;

In a June 2017 profile, Burgess Everett of &quot;Politico&quot; wrote, &quot;Washington is a surprisingly cozy place right now for Heitkamp. She met with Trump about a Cabinet position in December, visited the White House three times since and speaks regularly to Trump&#x27;s chief of staff Reince Priebus and top economic adviser Gary Cohn...Heitkamp is plainly chummier with Trump than she was to President Barack Obama.&quot; Everett quoted Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin as saying that it is &quot;a complete waste of time&quot; to try to get Heitkamp to vote with her party when she is determined to do otherwise. &quot;Her independence, and her closeness to Trump, will be a boon if she does run again,&quot; Everett wrote. &quot;Republicans respect Heitkamp, and Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) said she will enter as the favorite.&quot;

On September 6, 2017, Trump gave a speech in North Dakota and, in addition to inviting Republican officials onstage, also asked Heitkamp to join him, explaining: &quot;Everyone&#x27;s saying: What&#x27;s she doing up here? But I&#x27;ll tell you what: Good woman, and I think we&#x27;ll have your support—I hope we&#x27;ll have your support. And thank you very much, senator. Thank you for coming up.&quot; Amber Phillips of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted that given Trump&#x27;s popularity in North Dakota, his remarks had amounted to &quot;a potentially massive boost&quot; for Heitkamp as she sought &quot;to remain the state&#x27;s lone statewide elected Democrat.&quot; Heitkamp had flown with Trump to North Dakota on Air Force One.

Heitkamp heard from approximately 1,400 North Dakotans about Trump&#x27;s nomination of Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education. About 1,330 of them opposed it. She then announced her opposition to DeVos, attributing her decision to this overwhelming public reaction. &quot;Need an education secretary who puts students 1st &amp; will work to strengthen public school education, not privatize it as Betsy DeVos would,&quot; Heitkamp tweeted.

Heitkamp was the first Democrat to support and one of the handful of Democrats to vote to confirm Trump&#x27;s nominee Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State.

According to FiveThirtyEight, during her final two years in the Senate, Heitkamp voted the second-most in line with Trump among the Democratic Caucus, behind only Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia.

Relationship with Joe Biden

In regards to President Biden dropping out of the 2024 presidential election, Heitkamp said on July 21, 2024 that while she considers Biden an ally and a close friend, she added &quot;[today was] a good day for the Democratic Party.&quot; She called his decision &quot;a sacrifice he is making for the country.&quot; and added &quot;He has served this country so ably, it can&#x27;t have been easy.&quot;
=== Supreme Court ===
Heitkamp voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, telling CNBC that she had made this decision &quot;based on an interview and a review of his record.&quot; She said: &quot;Would he be the judge I&#x27;d pick? No, never...But he is the judge that the duly elected president picked.&quot;

In October 2018, Heitkamp voted against confirming Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, amid allegations that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted women. Her vote against Kavanaugh was considered politically risky, given North Dakota&#x27;s Republican leanings. During the three weeks after her October 6 vote, Real Clear Politics reported her polling deficit in her 2018 reelection campaign against Republican challenger Kevin Cramer had widened from 8.7% to 14%. In an interview, Heitkamp said that the &quot;better part of my career in public life has been working with victims&quot; and that her mother had been sexually assaulted as a teenager.

===Gun laws===
Heitkamp had an A rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA) for her consistent support of pro-gun legislation. In 2012, the NRA gave her an 86% score for supporting their positions; Gun Owners of America, another gun rights organization, gave her a 30% rating. Bloomberg News has commented that &quot;on guns, it will be hard to find room to the right of her.&quot;

In an April 11, 2013, interview, Heitkamp said that she intended to vote against the Manchin-Toomey amendment, which was introduced in the Senate after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. It would have amended the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to expand background checks to gun shows and internet purchases. Heitkamp said, &quot;I&#x27;m going to represent my state. ... in the end it&#x27;s not what any other senator believes. It&#x27;s about what the people of North Dakota believe.&quot;

Polling suggested that the majority of North Dakotans approve of prohibiting individuals on the No-Fly list from buying firearms and ammunition, but in June 2016, after the Orlando nightclub shooting, Heitkamp voted against such a prohibition. She was the only Democratic senator to do so. She instead expressed support for a &quot;compromise gun bill&quot; proposed by Susan Collins.

Her vote against expanded background checks for gun buyers angered many, including former White House chief of staff William M. Daley, who &quot;was so enraged he wrote a blistering attack in the Washington Post asking for his $2,500 campaign donation back.&quot;

Heitkamp declined to participate in the Democratic filibuster on gun control in June 2016, leading to harsh criticism by gun control groups such as the Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence and Everytown for Gun Safety.

===Energy and environment===
According to Reuters, Heitkamp &quot;has been a supporter of domestic energy development, both in fossil fuels and renewable resources.&quot; She has said that she supports the Keystone XL pipeline because it will create jobs, decrease America&#x27;s dependence on foreign oil from the Middle East, and help drive down the national debt. She has also said that many who oppose hydraulic fracturing have been exposed to &quot;junk science&quot; and do not know what it really is. She was Climate Hawks Vote&#x27;s lowest-rated Democratic senator on climate leadership in the 113th Congress and remains among the lowest in 2015.

In December 2016, Heitkamp told CNBC that although the Army Corps of Engineers had refused to approve permits needed to complete the Dakota Access pipeline, that would change under Trump. She said that she understood those who opposed the construction of the pipeline through Native American land, but added: &quot;I just think that this fight is not winnable.&quot;

In February 2017, Heitkamp was one of two Democratic senators to vote to confirm Scott Pruitt as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. In March 2017, she issued a statement supporting Trump&#x27;s approval of Keystone XL, calling it &quot;common sense&quot;. She also voted against the Stream Protection Rule.

==Personal life==
Heitkamp is married to Darwin Lange, a family practitioner. They reside in Mandan and have two adult children, Ali and Nathan. Heitkamp survived a bout with breast cancer in 2000. She is a member of the Catholic Church.

Heitkamp has said, &quot;I think certain people in my party know me pretty well and I&#x27;m too old to change. I would have a hard time figuring out how I would not say what I really thought at this point in my life. I always say, don&#x27;t ever get between a post-menopausal woman and [what she thinks is] a good idea.&quot;

<doc id="476688" wikidata="Q815575" url="?curid=476688" title="Beli Mawr">
<text>was an ancestor figure in Middle Welsh literature and genealogies. He is the father of Cassivellaunus, Arianrhod, Lludd Llaw Eraint, Llefelys, and Afallach. In certain medieval genealogies, he is listed as the son or husband of Anna, cousin of Mary, mother of Jesus. According to the Welsh Triads, Beli and Dôn were the parents of Arianrhod, but the mother of Beli&#x27;s other children—and the father of Dôn&#x27;s other children—is not mentioned in the medieval Welsh literature. Several royal lines in medieval Wales traced their ancestry to Beli. The &quot;Mabinogi&quot; names Penarddun as a daughter of Beli Mawr, but the genealogy is confused; it is possible she was meant to be his sister rather than daughter.

==Beli and Belenus==
The origin of the name Beli is still a matter of debate among scholars. The most popular hypothesis sees the name &quot;Beli&quot; as a Middle Welsh reflex of the Gaulish and Brittonic divine name &quot;Belenus&quot; (also attested as a personal name), but a more recent alternative is that proposed by Harvard Celticist John T. Koch, who suggests that &quot;Beli&quot; derives from a Proto-Celtic name &quot;Belgius&quot; or &quot;Bolgios&quot; borne by one of the chieftains who led the Gallic invasion of Macedonia in 280–279 BCE against King Ptolemy Ceraunus. 

Ptolemy was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty (Cleopatra), founded by his father, Ptolemy I Soter, a Greek general and the successor of Alexander the Great. Koch therefore proposes that this great leader &quot;Belgius&quot; came to be regarded as the namesake and ancestor of the powerful Brittonic and Gallic tribal group, the Belgae, whence would have come the doctrine that Beli was the ancestor of tribal dynasties. The Belgae were also described by Julius Caesar in Commentarii de Bello Gallico, his diary on the Gallic Wars.

Beli Mawr is claimed as the head of the House of Gwynedd by the line of Cunedda Wledig, founder of the Kingdom of Gwynedd, following the End of Roman rule in Britain during the late 4th century under Magnus Maximus. The pedigree is shown in the Harleian genealogies, the oldest documented genealogies of Welsh royal families. In Welsh legend, according to the Welsh Classical Dictionary, Beli Mawr was born between 120 BC and 80 BC.

==Beli son of Manogan==
Another Beli from medieval Welsh literature, who first appears in the 9th century &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; and is often confused or conflated with Beli Mawr in both medieval and modern sources, is Beli son of Manogan (also spelled Mynogan). This Beli is actually derived from the historical pre-Roman Brittonic king of the Catuvellauni, Cunobeline and his son Adminius (or Amminius). Via a series of textual corruptions that span several different popular books from Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages, the names of Cunobelinus and his son Adminius were combined and then jumbled, giving way to a new Beli, with the patronymic &quot;son of Manogan&quot;:
# Adminio, Cunobellini Brittannorum regis filio (Suetonius, &quot;Caligula&quot;, Ch. 44)
# Minocynobellinum Britannorum regis filium (Orosius, &quot;Historia Adversus Paganos&quot;, vii 5.5)
# Bellinus, filius Minocanni (&quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, ch. 19)

Rachel Bromwich writes that such a figure has origins in traditional names/characters: &quot;Beli Mawr is a character rooted far too firmly in Welsh tradition for his existence to be accounted for merely as an adaptation of Nennius&#x27;s Bellinus. Further, Loth showed that Manogan itself can be explained as a Celtic name, since Monocan appears in the Cartulaire de Redon (RC LI, p. 10; Chr. Br., p. 152). Two further instances of this name in Celtic sources may also be included: Jes. Gen. XVIII Manogan m. Pascen m. Cadell; and the Ogham inscription MINNACCANNI (Macalister, Corpus Inscriptionum Insularum Celticarum I, no. 135).&quot;

Thus, although Beli became a separate personage in medieval pseudohistory from Cunobelinus (Welsh &quot;Cynfelyn&quot;, Shakespeare&#x27;s Cymbeline), he was generally presented as a king reigning in the period immediately before the Roman invasion; his &quot;son&quot; Caswallawn is the historical Cassivellaunus.

==Henry of Huntingdon&#x27;s Belinus==
The 12th-century English historian Henry of Huntingdon, in his &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot; first published in 1129, follows the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; in his discussion of Julius Caesar&#x27;s invasion of Britain, mentioning a &quot;Belinus&quot;, brother of&quot; Cassibella(u)nus&quot;, who are both styled sons of &quot;Minocannus&quot;, but in later revisions of the text (and under the influence of Geoffrey of Monmouth), &quot;Liud&quot; (or &quot;Luid&quot;) (see Lludd Llaw Eraint).

==Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s Heli==
Beli also appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s history &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (1130s) as the British king Heli, son of Digueillus and father of Lud, Cassivellaunus and Nennius. He is said to have held the throne for 40 years, after which he was succeeded by his son Lud (Llud). In the Middle Welsh translations of Geoffrey&#x27;s work known collectively as &quot;Brut y Brenhinedd&quot;, Heli&#x27;s name was restored to Beli and his father renamed to Manogan.

<doc id="476691" wikidata="Q422972" url="?curid=476691" title="Focus (computing)">
<text>In a computing graphical user interface (GUI), a component has focus when it is selected to receive input from the user by an event such as a mouse button click or keypress. Moving the focus away from a specific user interface element is known as a blur event in relation to this element. Typically, the focus is withdrawn from an element by giving another element the focus. This means that focus and blur events are virtually simultaneous in relation to different user interface elements, one that becomes focused and one that is &quot;blurred&quot; (in the computing, not visual, sense).

The concept is similar to a cursor in a text-based environment. However, when considering a graphical interface, there is also a mouse pointer involved. Moving the mouse will typically move the mouse pointer without changing the focus. The focus can usually be changed by clicking on a component that can receive focus with the mouse. Many desktops also allow the focus to be changed with the keyboard. By convention, the  key is used to move the focus to the next focusable component and  to the previous one. When graphical interfaces were first introduced, many computers did not have mice, so this alternative was necessary. This feature makes it easier for people unable to use a mouse to use the user interface. In certain circumstances the arrow keys can be used to change focus.

==Window focus==
The behaviour of focus on one&#x27;s desktop can be governed by policies in window management.

===Click to focus===
On most mainstream user-interfaces, such as ones made by Microsoft and Apple, it is common to find a &quot;focus follows click&quot; policy (or &quot;click to focus&quot;), where one must click the mouse inside of the window for that window to gain focus. This also typically results in the window being raised above all other windows on screen. If a clickfocus model such as this is being used, the current application window continues to retain focus and collect input, even if the mouse pointer is over another application window.

===Focus follows pointer===
Another common policy on Unix systems using X Window System (X11) is the &quot;focus follows mouse&quot; policy (or FFM), where the focus automatically follows the current placement of the pointer. The focused window is not necessarily raised; parts of it may remain below other windows. Window managers with this policy usually offer &quot;autoraise,&quot; which raises the window when it is focused, typically after a configurable short delay. A possible consequence of a followfocus policy is that no window has focus when the pointer is moved over the background with no window underneath; otherwise the focus simply remains in the last window.

===Sloppy focus===
The sloppyfocus model is a variant of the followfocus model. It allows input to continue to be collected by the last focused window when the mouse pointer is moved away from any window, such as over a menubar or desktop area.

==Focus models used by X11 window managers==
==Intra-window component focus==
Individual components of a window may also have a focal position. For instance in a text editing package, the text editing window must have the Focus so that text can be entered. When text is entered into the component, it will appear at the position of the text-cursor, which will also normally be movable using the mouse pointer.

Which component should have the default focus, and how focus should move between components, are difficult but important problems in user interface design. Giving the wrong thing focus means that the user has to waste time moving the focus. Conversely, giving the right thing focus can significantly enhance the user experience.

<text>Yvon Godin (born May 12, 1955) is a Canadian politician.

Godin was a New Democratic Party (NDP) Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the riding of Acadie—Bathurst from 1997 until his retirement in 2015. Previously, Godin was a labour representative for the United Steelworkers. He was the NDP critic for Labour and Official Languages in his last term in parliament.

In 2003, he supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s campaign to lead the NDP.

==Involvement with the New Brunswick NDP==

As federal MP, Godin had a strained relationship with former New Brunswick New Democratic Party leader Elizabeth Weir. Following her resignation in 2005, however, there were rumours that Godin might resign his federal seat and run to replace her as provincial party leader at the party&#x27;s 2005 leadership convention. Ultimately, Godin declined to stand as a candidate, and Allison Brewer was elected NB NDP leader.

Following a poor showing in the 2006 New Brunswick provincial election, Brewer also resigned, and there were renewed rumours Godin would seek the leadership. However Godin demurred again, instead endorsing former priest Roger Duguay. Duguay had run in the provincial riding of Miramichi Bay-Neguac in the last provincial election, and received 26.2% of the vote, the best showing of any NDP candidate. The Miramichi Bay-Neguac riding overlaps with Godin&#x27;s federal riding. Duguay was subsequently elected leader at the party&#x27;s October 13, 2007 leadership convention but resigned after a disappointing result in the 2010 provincial election

Godin also had a strained relationship with Duguay&#x27;s successor, Dominic Cardy. Following the 2014 provincial election, Godin criticized Cardy&#x27;s leadership saying that Cardy had moved the provincial party too far to the centre. &quot;The problem, I think, with the provincial party, with Dominic, was that I think he was too much to the right to even be in the centre, and I think people read into that,&quot; said Godin who added: &quot;I think it did hurt the party. People were looking for the NDP, they were doing really well, and [voters] wanted change from the existing parties that we have now, who are serving the big corporations and forgetting about the people. I think that&#x27;s what happened.&quot; Cardy retorted by accusing Godin of failing to involve himself in the development of the provincial party&#x27;s platform, saying &quot;He&#x27;s never been to a provincial party meeting during my time as leader.&quot;

==Claim of breached privilege==

In September 2014, Godin claimed that his privileges as a Member were breached when he was delayed in accessing the Parliamentary precinct during an official visit by German President Joachim Gauck. In a committee meeting on October 21, video evidence was presented that showed Godin was delayed in crossing the street by just 70 seconds. In response, Godin demanded to know whether the video had been sped up.

<doc id="476703" wikidata="Q378816" url="?curid=476703" title="Prasutagus">
<text>Prasutagus (died AD 60 or 61) was king of the Iceni, a British Celtic tribe who inhabited roughly what is now Norfolk, in the 1st century AD. He is best known as the husband of Boudica.

Prasutagus may have been one of the eleven kings who surrendered to Claudius following the Roman conquest in 43, or he may have been installed as king following the defeat of a rebellion of the Iceni in 47. As an ally of Rome his tribe were allowed to remain nominally independent, albeit disarmed, and to ensure this Prasutagus named the Roman emperor as co-heir to his kingdom, along with his two daughters. Tacitus says he lived a long and prosperous life, but when he died, the Romans ignored his will and took over, depriving the nobles of their lands and plundering the kingdom. Boudica was flogged and their daughters raped. Roman financiers called in their loans. All this led to the revolt of the Iceni, under the leadership of Boudica, in 60 or 61. 

Coins have been found in Suffolk inscribed , &quot;under Esuprastus Esico made (this)&quot; in Latin. Some archaeologists believe that Esuprastus was the true name of the king Tacitus calls Prasutagus, while others think he was a different person. Others interpret Esuprastus is a compound name, with &quot;Esu-&quot; deriving from the god Esus and meaning &quot;lord&quot;, &quot;master&quot; or &quot;honour&quot;, and &quot;Prasto-&quot; being an abbreviated personal name, the coin inscription thus meaning &quot;under Lord Prasto-&quot;. It is also notable that coins of the Corieltauvi have been found inscribed with the similar names and . The name of an earlier king of the Iceni appears on coins as , a name which may be related to the Latin &quot;scaeva&quot;, &quot;left&quot;, and &quot;scaevola&quot;, &quot;left-handed&quot;. Both rulers&#x27; coins are similarly Roman in style and language and were probably issued within twenty years of each other. Chris Rudd suggests that Esuprastus, whom he identifies with Prasutagus, succeeded Scavo after the Icenian rebellion of 47.

Icenian coins dating from the 1st century AD use the spelling ECEN rather than ECE: It has been argued that this change coincides with the start of Prasutagus&#x27;s reign, with the coins of Antedios showing only the name of the ruler rather than the tribe. &quot;If so, the coins suggest that the Prasutagus era commenced only after the events of 47&quot;.

<doc id="476704" wikidata="Q3274739" url="?curid=476704" title="Camptotheca">
<text>Camptotheca (happy tree, cancer tree, or tree of life) is a genus of medium-sized deciduous trees growing to tall, native to southern China and Tibet. The genus is usually included in the tupelo family Nyssaceae, but sometimes included (with the tupelos) in the dogwood family Cornaceae.

The name &quot;happy tree&quot; is a direct translation of the Chinese name xǐ shù (Simplified Chinese:喜树).

There are two species:
*&quot;Camptotheca acuminata&quot; Decne.
*&quot;Camptotheca lowreyana&quot; S.Y.Li

The bark and stems of &quot;C. acuminata&quot; contain the alkaloid camptothecin. Several chemical derivatives of camptothecin are under investigation for or used as drugs for cancer treatment, including irinotecan, topotecan, rubitecan.

&quot;C. acuminata&quot; also contains the chemical compounds trifolin and hyperoside.

<doc id="476712" wikidata="Q4974613" url="?curid=476712" title="Brookgreen Gardens">
<text>Brookgreen Gardens is a sculpture garden and wildlife preserve, located just south of Murrells Inlet, in the U.S. state of South Carolina. The property includes several themed gardens featuring American figurative sculptures, the Lowcountry Zoo, and trails through several ecosystems in nature reserves on the property. It was founded by Archer Milton Huntington, stepson of railroad magnate Collis Potter Huntington, and Anna Hyatt Huntington, his wife, to feature sculptures by Anna and her sister Harriet Randolph Hyatt Mayor, along with other American sculptors. Brookgreen Gardens was opened in 1932. It was developed on property of four former rice plantations, taking its name from the former Brookgreen Plantation, which dates to the antebellum period.

== Early history ==
The property that now comprises Brookgreen Gardens was four rice plantations. The plantations from south to north were The Oaks, Brookgreen, Springfield, and Laurel Hill. The current gardens and surrounding facilities are located completely within the former Brookgreen Plantation, which was owned by Joshua John Ward. Before his death in 1853, he held more than 1,000 enslaved African Americans and in 1860 his estate (in his name) was the largest slaveholder in the United States.

Only a handful of relics survive on the former plantations. The Alston (or Allston) cemetery survives on the grounds of The Oaks plantation. Gov. Joseph Alston and his child are buried in the cemetery. The same grave is a memorial to the governor&#x27;s wife Theodosia Burr Alston, daughter of Vice President of the United States Aaron Burr, who was lost at sea. Her ghost is said to haunt the Grand Strand, looking for her father. The rice mill at Laurel Hill is all that stands of that plantation today. During the American Civil War, Confederates built an earthen structure on the grounds to block Union Navy ships from coming into the tidal rivers.

== The Huntingtons==
Archer and Anna Hyatt Huntington of Redding, Connecticut purchased the four plantations in order to develop gardens to showcase her sculptures. Situated on Waccamaw Neck in Georgetown County, South Carolina, between the Waccamaw River and the Atlantic Ocean, Brookgreen Gardens is the country&#x27;s first public sculpture garden. It has the largest collection in the world of figurative sculpture by American artists in an outdoor setting. It is also a nature and historical preserve with a small zoo and a nature exhibition center.

Archer and Anna Hyatt Huntington first visited the area in 1929. Because they were captivated by its beauty, they purchased nearly of forest, swamp, rice fields, and beachfront. They intended to establish a winter home on the coast, but Anna saw the potential of the property. They began to develop her vision of making it a showcase for her sculptures. Archer, son of philanthropists Arabella Worsham Huntington and stepson of Collis Huntington, and Anna have donated property and contributed to U.S. arts and culture in a number of states. Her sculpture of Joan of Arc is a feature of New York City&#x27;s Riverside Park.

===Sculpture gardens===


About 1,445 works of American figurative sculpture are displayed at the Archer and Anna Hyatt Huntington Sculpture Garden. Many of the works are by Hyatt Huntington, but other artists are also featured. Walkways and garden paths link the sculptures in their distinctive garden, fountain, or landscape settings, with vistas of the scenery surrounding them.
A area of Brookgreen Gardens was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The sculpture garden portion, , of Brookgreen Gardens was included in the designation of Atalaya and Brookgreen Gardens as a National Historic Landmark in 1984. Atalaya Castle is just across U.S. 17, which cuts through the former combined Huntington property. A seventy-inch long sea horse, sculpted by Joseph Kiselewski, was place in Brookgreen Gardens in 1942.

The sculpture gardens also include works by:
* Robert Alexander Baillie
* Gutzon Borglum
* Joseph Lorkowski Boulton
* Clio Hinton Bracken
* Cornelia Van Auken Chapin
* Henry Clews
* Joseph Bailey Ellis

===Lowcountry Trail===
Winner of the South Carolina Heritage Tourism Award, the Lowcountry Trail is a boardwalk that crosses the hillside overlooking Mainfield, a restored rice field of the former Brookgreen Plantation. For enslaved African Americans on Brookgreen Plantation, this hill was a bridge between the world of daily work and life in the slave village beyond the crest of the hill. The rhythms of life – planting, growing, harvesting, threshing – changed seasonally for everyone on the rice plantation.

Archaeological survey and excavation projects have revealed the remains of four structures on the hillside: the site of the overseer&#x27;s residence at the apex of the hill, and its kitchen, smokehouse and dependency closer to the edge of the rice field. Along the trail, interpretive panels that describe life on a rice plantation and four stainless steel figures have been placed to represent the Plantation Owner, the Overseer, and an Enslaved African Male and an Enslaved African Female. These figures were created in stainless steel by Babette Bloch.

====Lowcountry Trail Audio Tour====
The Lowcountry Trail Audio Tour is a public education program that emphasizes historic preservation. The tour winds along the Ricefield Overlook and adjacent rice field and is free with garden admission.

===Zoo and plantation sites===
The Lowcountry Zoo and the Lowcountry Center are also on the property. &#x27;Trekker tours&#x27; are conducted on the backroads of the former plantations. Recent archeological work has uncovered the foundations of several buildings at The Oaks plantation. Ponds have been created from the former &#x27;Brookgreen&#x27; plantation house sites.

===Natural areas===
The Atlantic Coast side of the property was later leased to the state of South Carolina to form Huntington Beach State Park. Boat tours are available from here with views of Sandy Island. A self-guided tour of the nature trail shows off the 2000 identified species of life, including longleaf pines, Spanish moss draped live oaks, and vistas of the river, and nearby marshland. The gardens make every effort to preserve the natural environment.

===Nights of a Thousand Candles===
Every year, the Brookgreen Gardens are lit with more than 2,700 candles and countless lights set among the plants, trees and sculptures of the garden. Tickets for the same are available every year for visitors.

===Labyrinth===
The Labyrinth at Brookgreen Gardens is located along the north end of the Trail Beyond the Garden Wall. It was built in 2009 and underwent a substantial redesign in 2014 under the direction of artist Kenny Pellar. It is maintained today by both staff and volunteers as an oasis for members and guests. The Labyrinth is available to walkers any time the Gardens are open. However, the Labyrinth will be closed when weather or river conditions indicate safety concerns.

<text>Britain&#x27;s Road to Socialism is the programme of the Communist Party of Britain, and is adhered to by the Young Communist League and the editors of the &quot;Morning Star&quot; newspaper.

It proposes that socialism can be achieved in Britain by the working class leading various political forces in a popular democratic alliance against monopoly capital, and implementing a left-wing programme of socialist construction. Part of this strategy involves winning the labour movement with a left-wing position, through struggle in the existing democratic bodies of the working class, such as trades unions, trades union councils and tenants&#x27; associations.

==History==
The publication of Communist Party programmes in Britain began in the 1920s with the release of &quot;Class against Class, the General Election Programme of the Communist Party of Great Britain&quot;. This was published in 1929 by the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), the precursor to the Communist Party of Britain, for the general election of that year in which the party fielded 25 candidates. The subsequent programme, titled &quot;For Soviet Britain&quot;, was published for the party&#x27;s 13th Congress in 1935. An unnamed draft programme was issued in 1939 but the Second World War and its aftermath delayed the publication of an updated programme until the 1950s.

&quot;For Soviet Britain&quot; was finally superseded in February 1951 when &quot;The British Road to Socialism&quot; was published, the original incarnation of today&#x27;s &quot;Britain&#x27;s Road to Socialism&quot;. The first edition of the document received the personal approval of Joseph Stalin before publication. The &quot;British Road&quot; built on themes already present in the Communist Party&#x27;s 1949 election programme &quot;The Socialist Road for Britain&quot;, and Stalin&#x27;s commentary did not suggest significant diversion from the existing policy. Under its original name, it underwent revisions in 1952, 1958, 1968 and 1977.

When the CPGB&#x27;s leadership abandoned &quot;The British Road to Socialism&quot; in 1985, elements in the party that remained loyal to the programme, including the then editorial board of &quot;The Morning Star&quot;, split to form the Communist Party of Britain in 1988. The re-established party published the 6th edition of the programme in 1989, with a revision in 1992 to consider the onset of capitalist restoration in Eastern Europe. Three subsequent editions have been produced with further revisions and a title change to &quot;Britain&#x27;s Road to Socialism&quot;. The 7th edition was published in 2001, the 8th in 2011, and the 9th in 2020.

<text>Ushant (; , ; , ) is a French island at the southwestern end of the English Channel which marks the westernmost point of metropolitan France. It belongs to Brittany and in medieval times, Léon. In lower tiers of government, it is a commune in the Finistère department. It is the only place in Brittany, save for Brittany itself, with a separate name in English.

==Geography==
Neighbouring islets include Keller Island () and Kadoran () to the north. The channel between Ushant and Keller is called the .

Ushant marks the southern limit of the Celtic Sea and the southern end to the western English Channel, the northern end being the Isles of Scilly, southwest of Land&#x27;s End in Cornwall, England. According to definitions of the International Hydrographic Organization the island lies outside the English Channel and is in the Celtic Sea.

The island is a rocky landmass at most , covering .

==History==
Ushant is famous for its maritime past, both as a fishing community and as a key landmark in the Channel approaches. It is named in the refrain of the sea shanty &quot;Spanish Ladies&quot;:

Several naval battles have been fought near Ushant between the British and French navies.

On 23 July 1815 the captive Emperor Napoleon – aboard towards his final exile – spent several hours on deck watching Ushant, the last part of France he would see.

During World War II, a force of British Commandos and US Army Rangers of the 29th Provisional Rangers successfully attacked a German radar installation on the island.

In March 1978, the oil tanker &quot;Amoco Cadiz&quot; ran aground at Portsall about from the island, leading to major pollution of the Brittany coast.

According to a repetitive old Breton proverb, (&quot;Who sees Molène sees his pains (or penalty) / who sees Ushant sees his blood / who sees Sein sees his end / who sees Groix sees his cross&quot;). This proverb underlines local points, which are often deadly to navigate with many rocks, and tidal streams of more than ten knots.

A standard start and finish line for traditional all-oceans circumnavigations is between Ushant and Lizard Point.

There is a single school on the island, attended by the majority of the island&#x27;s youth: L&#x27;École D&#x27;Ouessant, south-east of the main town. It was founded in 1865 by Scottish refugees fleeing English persecution. It is the only large workplace on the island, and a major employer.

==Population==

The sole village on the island is Lambaol (Lampaul), which has the mayoral office, school and post office. People also live in the outlying hamlets of Feuteun Vélen, Frugullou, Pen ar Lan, and Porsguen.
==Climate==
Ushant&#x27;s climate is oceanic (&quot;Cfb&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification: temperate, fully humid, temperate summer, with generally cool, rainy winters and temperate, drier summers.

&lt;br&gt;
==Sights==
The Creac&#x27;h lighthouse () is reputedly the most powerful in Europe. is the French system name for Plymouth in the British system of the Shipping Forecast.

==Cultural ties to Scotland==
In 2007, Ushant hosted a Scottish book festival and subsequently created their own tartan registered with the Scottish Register of Tartans; and in August 2010, the islanders were reported to be seeking to establish cultural links with a Scottish island. Rob Gibson, Member of the Scottish Parliament for the Highlands and Islands welcomed the suggestion.

== Transport ==

Ushant is connected to the French mainland by air and sea. Passenger ferries of the Penn Ar Bed company operate from Brest and Le Conquet year-round, and also from Camaret in summer, stopping at the island of Molène en route. The airline Finistair operates flights on Cessna 208 planes from Brest Bretagne Airport.

==Fauna==

Ouessant sheep form a rare breed, originating here. These are northern European short-tailed sheep, ubiquitous in northern Europe up to Roman times, but which now survives only in a few places. Apart from Ushant, these are in remote islands and mountains of Britain and Scandinavia and some places around the Baltic Sea. It is one of the smallest breeds of domestic sheep. It is usually black or dark brown (a few are white), and it is now kept elsewhere in the world as a heritage breed.

The isolation of the island has helped the conservation of the European dark bee (&quot;Apis mellifera mellifera&quot;), unaffected by pollution, pesticides and Varroa parasites. In the rest of France, it has been substituted by &quot;Apis mellifera ligustica&quot;. As a side effect, populations of the bee louse, &quot;Braula coeca&quot;, that has elsewhere perished through pesticides can still be found among the island&#x27;s bee population. The association is attempting to conserve and increase the numbers of the European dark bee, intending to reintroduce it in Western France.

Ushant and the Molène archipelago support Europe&#x27;s southernmost colony of grey seals. They are mostly at Point Cadoran, on Ushant&#x27;s north coast, where the strong currents keep the water temperature below 15 degrees Celsius (59 °F), the warmest that the seals can tolerate.

<doc id="476765" wikidata="Q7634264" url="?curid=476765" title="Sue Rodriguez">
<text>Sue Rodriguez (August 2, 1950 – February 12, 1994) was a Canadian right-to-die activist. In August 1991, she was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease) and was given two to five years to live. She ultimately made the decision to end her life and she sought the assistance of a doctor to that end, leading to a legal battle. She lost her case in front of the Supreme Court of Canada, but took her own life with the help of an anonymous doctor on February 12, 1994. She is cited as an important figure in the eventual legalization of medical assistance in dying in Canada.

== Life ==
Sue Rodriguez was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba and grew up in the Toronto suburb of Thornhill. She lived in California for a time before returning to Canada. Her first marriage to Henry Rodriguez ended after less than eight years, and she had a son.

== Death ==
After her ALS diagnosis, Rodriguez requested the help of a physician for medical aid in dying. However, no physicians were willing to fulfill the request; under section 241(b) of Canada&#x27;s &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, anyone who &quot;...aids or abets a person to commit suicide, whether suicide ensues or not, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years&quot;. Rodriguez sought a legal exception in her home province, British Columbia, but was denied.

The British Columbia Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA) filed a lawsuit, &quot;Rodriguez v British Columbia (AG)&quot;, that challenged section 241(b) as contrary to sections 7, 12, and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In a videotaped address to Parliament on November 24, 1992, Rodriguez famously asked, “If I cannot give consent to my own death, whose body is this? Who owns my life?” On May 20, 1993, her case was heard by the Supreme Court of Canada. On September 30 of that year, it decided against her 5–4.

On February 12, 1994, with the assistance of an anonymous doctor, Sue Rodriguez ended her own life by ingesting a liquid mixture of morphine and secobarbital. The doctor&#x27;s intervention was arranged by MP Svend Robinson, who was regarded as one of Rodriguez&#x27;s most prominent supporters. Robinson was present at her death. However, by her request, her ex-husband Henry and their son Cole were not. An investigation was undertaken, but no charges were laid. Robinson has vowed never to reveal the anonymous doctor&#x27;s identity.

Almost 23 years later, on June 7, 2016, medical assistance in dying became legal in Canada as the result of a similar Supreme Court case, &quot;Carter v Canada (AG)&quot;. The Court unanimously struck down parts of section 241(b) and section 14 of the Criminal Code which the justices ruled unjustifiably infringed on section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

== In the media ==
The 1996 book &quot;Timely Death&quot; was inspired by the Sue Rodriguez story, and the 1998 film &quot;At the End of the Day: The Sue Rodriguez Story&quot;, which stars Wendy Crewson as Sue Rodriguez, dramatizes her story.

On June 17, 2016, medically assisted dying became legal in Canada. An emotional Svend Robinson, who now lives in Geneva, Switzerland, told the press: “Today’s ruling is a victory for compassion, for justice and for humanity. And I pay tribute to the memory of Sue Rodriguez, who with courage, passion and dignity blazed the trail that led to this historic day. She would have been thrilled&quot;.

<text>The codice_1 command-line utility is a job scheduler on Unix-like operating systems. Users who set up and maintain software environments use cron to schedule jobs (commands or shell scripts), also known as cron jobs, to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals. It typically automates system maintenance or administration—though its general-purpose nature makes it useful for things like downloading files from the Internet and downloading email at regular intervals.

Cron is most suitable for scheduling repetitive tasks. Scheduling one-time tasks can be accomplished using the associated &quot;at&quot; utility.

Cron&#x27;s name originates from Chronos, the Greek word for time.

== Overview == 
The actions of cron are driven by a crontab (cron table) file, a configuration file that specifies shell commands to run periodically on a given schedule. The crontab files are stored where the lists of jobs and other instructions to the cron daemon are kept. Users can have their own individual crontab files and often there is a system-wide crontab file (usually in codice_2 or a subdirectory of codice_2 e.g. ) that only system administrators can edit.

Each line of a crontab file represents a job, and looks like this:

# * * * * * &lt;command to execute&gt;
# | | | | day of the week (0–6) (Sunday to Saturday; 
# | | | month (1–12) 7 is also Sunday on some systems)
# | | day of the month (1–31)
# | hour (0–23)
# minute (0–59)

The syntax of each line expects a cron expression made of five fields which represent the time to execute the command, followed by a shell command to execute.

While normally the job is executed when the time/date specification fields all match the current time and date, there is one exception: if both &quot;day of month&quot; (field 3) and &quot;day of week&quot; (field 5) are restricted (not contain &quot;*&quot;), then one or both must match the current day. 

For example, the following clears the Apache error log at one minute past midnight (00:01) every day, assuming that the default shell for the cron user is Bourne shell compliant:
1 0 * * * printf &quot;&quot; &gt; /var/log/apache/error_log
This example runs a shell program called export_dump.sh at 23:45 (11:45 PM) every Saturday.

45 23 * * 6 /home/oracle/scripts/export_dump.sh
Note: On some systems it is also possible to specify codice_4 to run for every &quot;n&quot;-th interval of time. Also, specifying multiple specific time intervals can be done with commas (e.g., codice_5). The line below would output &quot;hello world&quot; to the command line every 5th minute of every first, second and third hour (i.e., 01:00, 01:05, 01:10, up until 03:55). 
*/5 1,2,3 * * * echo hello world
The configuration file for a user can be edited by calling codice_6 regardless of where the actual implementation stores this file.

Some codice_1 implementations, such as the popular 4th BSD edition written by Paul Vixie and included in many Linux distributions, add a sixth field: an account username that runs the specified job (subject to user existence and permissions). This is allowed only in the system crontabs—not in others, which are each assigned to a single user to configure. The sixth field is alternatively sometimes used for &quot;year&quot; instead of an account username—the nncron daemon for Windows does this.

The Amazon EventBridge implementation of cron does not use 0 based day of week, instead it is 1-7 SUN-SAT (instead of 0-6), as well as supporting additional expression features such as first-weekday and last-day-of-month.

=== Nonstandard predefined scheduling definitions === 
Some cron implementations support the following non-standard macros:

codice_8 configures a job to run once when the daemon is started. Since cron is typically never restarted, this typically corresponds to the machine being booted. This behavior is enforced in some variations of cron, such as that provided in Debian, so that simply restarting the daemon does not re-run codice_8 jobs.

codice_8 can be useful if there is a need to start up a server or daemon under a particular user, and the user does not have access to configure init to start the program.

=== Cron permissions ===
These two files play an important role:
* /etc/cron.allow – If this file exists, it must contain the user&#x27;s name for that user to be allowed to use cron jobs.
* /etc/cron.deny – If the cron.allow file does not exist but the /etc/cron.deny file does exist then, to use cron jobs, users must not be listed in the /etc/cron.deny file.

Note that if neither of these files exists then, depending on site-dependent configuration parameters, either only the super user can use cron jobs, or all users can use cron jobs.

=== Time zone handling ===
Most cron implementations simply interpret crontab entries in the system time zone setting that the cron daemon runs under. This can be a source of dispute if a large multi-user machine has users in several time zones, especially if the system default time zone includes the potentially confusing DST. Thus, a cron implementation may as a special case recognize lines of the form &quot;CRON_TZ=&lt;time zone&gt;&quot; in user crontabs, interpreting subsequent crontab entries relative to that time zone.

== History ==

=== Early versions ===
The cron in Version 7 Unix was a system service (later called a daemon) invoked from codice_11 when the operating system entered multi-user mode. Its algorithm was straightforward:
# Read codice_12
# Determine if any commands must run at the current date and time, and if so, run them as the superuser, root.
# Sleep for one minute
# Repeat from step 1.

This version of cron was basic and robust but it also consumed resources whether it found any work to do or not. In an experiment at Purdue University in the late 1970s to extend cron&#x27;s service to all 100 users on a time-shared VAX, it was found to place too much load on the system.

=== Multi-user capability ===

The next version of cron, with the release of Unix System V, was created to extend the capabilities of cron to all users of a Unix system, not just the superuser. Though this may seem trivial today with most Unix and Unix-like systems having powerful processors and small numbers of users, at the time it required a new approach on a one-MIPS system having roughly 100 user accounts.

In the August, 1977 issue of the &quot;Communications of the ACM&quot;, W. R. Franta and Kurt Maly published an article titled &quot;An efficient data structure for the simulation event set&quot;, describing an event queue data structure for discrete event-driven simulation systems that demonstrated &quot;performance superior to that of commonly used simple linked list algorithms&quot;, good behavior given non-uniform time distributions, and worst case complexity formula_1, &quot;n&quot; being the number of events in the queue.

A Purdue graduate student, Robert Brown, reviewing this article, recognized the parallel between cron and discrete event simulators, and created an implementation of the Franta–Maly event list manager (ELM) for experimentation. Discrete event simulators run in &quot;virtual time&quot;, peeling events off the event queue as quickly as possible and advancing their notion of &quot;now&quot; to the scheduled time of the next event. Running the event simulator in &quot;real time&quot; instead of virtual time created a version of cron that spent most of its time sleeping, waiting for the scheduled time to execute the task at the head of the event list.

The following school year brought new students into the graduate program at Purdue, including Keith Williamson, who joined the systems staff in the Computer Science department. As a &quot;warm up task&quot; Brown asked him to flesh out the prototype cron into a production service, and this multi-user cron went into use at Purdue in late 1979. This version of cron wholly replaced the codice_13 that was in use on the computer science department&#x27;s VAX 11/780 running 32/V.

The algorithm used by this cron is as follows:
# On start-up, look for a file named codice_14 in the home directories of all account holders.
# For each crontab file found, determine the next time in the future that each command must run.
# Place those commands on the Franta–Maly event list with their corresponding time and their &quot;five field&quot; time specifier.
# Enter main loop:
## Examine the task entry at the head of the queue, compute how far in the future it must run.
## Sleep for that period of time.
## On awakening and after verifying the correct time, execute the task at the head of the queue (in background) with the privileges of the user who created it.
## Determine the next time in the future to run this command and place it back on the event list at that time value.

Additionally, the daemon responds to SIGHUP signals to rescan modified crontab files and schedules special &quot;wake up events&quot; on the hour and half-hour to look for modified crontab files. Much detail is omitted here concerning the inaccuracies of computer time-of-day tracking, Unix alarm scheduling, explicit time-of-day changes, and process management, all of which account for the majority of the lines of code in this cron. This cron also captured the output of &quot;stdout&quot; and &quot;stderr&quot; and e-mailed any output to the crontab owner.

The resources consumed by this cron scale only with the amount of work it is given and do not inherently increase over time, with the exception of periodically checking for changes.

Williamson completed his studies and departed the University with a Masters of Science in Computer Science and joined AT&amp;T Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, and took this cron with him. At Bell Labs, he and others incorporated the Unix codice_15 command into cron, moved the crontab files out of users&#x27; home directories (which were not host-specific) and into a common host-specific spool directory, and of necessity added the codice_16 command to allow users to copy their crontabs to that spool directory.

This version of cron later appeared largely unchanged in Unix System V and in BSD and their derivatives, Solaris from Sun Microsystems, IRIX from Silicon Graphics, HP-UX from Hewlett-Packard, and AIX from IBM. Technically, the original license for these implementations should be with the Purdue Research Foundation who funded the work, but this took place at a time when little concern was given to such matters.

=== Modern versions ===
With the advent of the GNU Project and Linux, new crons appeared. The most prevalent of these is the Vixie cron, originally coded by Paul Vixie in 1987. Version 3 of Vixie cron was released in late 1993. Version 4.1 was renamed to ISC Cron and was released in January 2004. Version 3, with some minor bugfixes, is used in most distributions of Linux and BSDs.

In 2007, Red Hat forked vixie-cron 4.1 to the cronie project, adding features such as PAM and SELinux support. In 2009, anacron 2.3 was merged into cronie. Anacron is not an independent cron program however; another cron job must call it. 

DragonFly&#x27;s dcron was made by its founder Matt Dillon, and its maintainership was taken over by Jim Pryor in 2010.

In 2003, Dale Mellor introduced mcron, a cron variant written in Guile which provides cross-compatibility with Vixie cron while also providing greater flexibility as it allows arbitrary scheme code to be used in scheduling calculations and job definitions. Since both the mcron daemon and the crontab files are usually written in scheme (though mcron also accepts traditional Vixie crontabs), the cumulative state of a user&#x27;s job queue is available to their job code, which may be scheduled to run iff the results of other jobs meet certain criteria. Mcron is deployed by default under the Guix package manager, which includes provisions (services) for the package manager to monadically emit mcron crontabs while both ensuring that packages needed for job execution are installed and that the corresponding crontabs correctly refer to them.

A webcron solution schedules ring tasks to run on a regular basis wherever cron implementations are not available in a web hosting environment.

==Cron expression==
A cron expression is a string comprising five or six fields separated by white space that represents a set of times, normally as a schedule to execute some routine.

Comments begin with a comment mark #, and must be on a line by themselves.

The month and weekday abbreviations are not case-sensitive.

In the particular case of the system crontab file (/etc/crontab), a &quot;user&quot; field inserts itself before the &quot;command&quot;. It is generally set to &#x27;root&#x27;.

In some uses of the cron format there is also a &quot;seconds&quot; field at the beginning of the pattern. In that case, the cron expression is a string comprising 6 or 7 fields.

;Asterisk 
: Asterisks (also known as wildcard) represents &quot;all&quot;. For example, using &quot;* * * * *&quot; will run every minute. Using &quot;* * * * 1&quot; will run every minute only on Monday. Using six asterisks means every second when seconds are supported.

;Comma : Commas are used to separate items of a list. For example, using &quot;MON,WED,FRI&quot; in the 5th field (day of week) means Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

;Hyphen ( codice_17 ): Hyphen defines ranges. For example, &quot;2000-2010&quot; indicates every year between 2000 and 2010, inclusive.

;Percent ( codice_18 ): Percent-signs (%) in the command, unless escaped with backslash (\), are changed into newline characters, and all data after the first % are sent to the command as standard input.

=== Non-standard characters ===
The following are non-standard characters and exist only in some cron implementations, such as the Quartz Java scheduler.
: &#x27;L&#x27; stands for &quot;last&quot;. When used in the day-of-week field, it allows specifying constructs such as &quot;the last Friday&quot; (&quot;) of a given month. In the day-of-month field, it specifies the last day of the month.
: The &#x27;W&#x27; character is allowed for the day-of-month field. This character is used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day. As an example, if &quot; is specified as the value for the day-of-month field, the meaning is: &quot;the nearest weekday to the 15th of the month.&quot; So, if the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger fires on Friday the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger fires on Monday the 16th. If the 15th is a Tuesday, then it fires on Tuesday the 15th. However, if &quot;1W&quot; is specified as the value for day-of-month, and the 1st is a Saturday, the trigger fires on Monday the 3rd, as it does not &#x27;jump&#x27; over the boundary of a month&#x27;s days. The &#x27;W&#x27; character can be specified only when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days.
;Hash ()
: &#x27;#&#x27; is allowed for the day-of-week field, and must be followed by a number between one and five. It allows specifying constructs such as &quot;the second Friday&quot; of a given month. For example, entering &quot;5#3&quot; in the day-of-week field corresponds to the third Friday of every month.
;Question mark ()
: In some implementations, used instead of &quot; for leaving either day-of-month or day-of-week blank. Other cron implementations substitute &quot;?&quot; with the start-up time of the cron daemon, so that would be updated to if cron started-up on 8:25am, and would run at this time every day until restarted again.
;Slash (codice_19)
: In vixie-cron, slashes can be combined with ranges to specify step values. For example, in the minutes field indicates every 5 minutes (see note below about frequencies). It is shorthand for the more verbose POSIX form . POSIX does not define a use for slashes; its rationale (commenting on a BSD extension) notes that the definition is based on System V format but does not exclude the possibility of extensions.
:Note that frequencies in general cannot be expressed; only step values which evenly divide their range express accurate frequencies (for minutes and seconds, that&#x27;s and because 60 is evenly divisible by those numbers; for hours, that&#x27;s and ); all other possible &quot;steps&quot; and all other fields yield inconsistent &quot;short&quot; periods at the end of the time-unit before it &quot;resets&quot; to the next minute, second, or day; for example, entering for the day field sometimes executes after 1, 2, or 3 days, depending on the month and leap year; this is because cron is stateless (it does not remember the time of the last execution nor count the difference between it and now, required for accurate frequency counting—instead, cron is a mere pattern-matcher).
:Some language-specific libraries offering crontab scheduling ability do not require &quot;strict&quot; ranges to the left of the slash when ranges are used. In these cases, is the same as a vixie-cron schedule of in the minutes section. Similarly, you can remove the extra from , from , and from for hours, days, and months; respectively.
: &#x27;H&#x27; is used in the Jenkins continuous integration system to indicate that a &quot;hashed&quot; value is substituted. Thus instead of a fixed number such as &quot; which means at 20 minutes after the hour every hour, &quot; indicates that the task is performed every hour at an unspecified but invariant time for each task. This allows spreading out tasks over time, rather than having all of them start at the same time and compete for resources.

<doc id="476776" wikidata="Q2091694" url="?curid=476776" title="Criminal Code (Canada)">
<text>The Criminal Code () is a law of the Parliament of Canada that codifies most criminal offences and procedures in Canada. Its official long title is An Act respecting the Criminal Law (French: ). It is indexed in the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985 as chapter number C-46 and it is sometimes abbreviated as &quot;Cr.C.&quot; (French: ) in legal reports. Section 91(27) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; establishes that the Parliament of Canada has sole jurisdiction over criminal law.

The &quot;Criminal Code&quot; contains some defences, but most are part of the common law rather than statute. Important Canadian criminal laws not forming part of the Code include the &quot;Firearms Act&quot;, the &quot;Controlled Drugs and Substances Act&quot;, the &quot;Canada Evidence Act&quot;, the &quot;Food and Drugs Act&quot;, the &quot;Youth Criminal Justice Act&quot; and the &quot;Contraventions Act&quot;. The Code underwent a major revision in 1954 but nonetheless remains the fundamental criminal law of Canada, despite several initiatives at major reform or the enactment of a new criminal code entirely. In 2019, the Trudeau government made a large revision to the Code which repealed numerous unconstitutional or archaic offences that had remained in it up to that point.

One of the conveniences of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; was that it constituted the principle that no person could be convicted of a crime unless otherwise specifically outlined and stated in a statute. This legal document has played a major part in Canada&#x27;s history and has also helped form other legal acts and laws, for example, the &quot;Controlled Drugs and Substances Act&quot;.

<text>The Park Estate is a private residential housing estate to the west of Nottingham city centre, England. It is noted for its Victorian architecture, although many of the houses have been altered, extended or converted into flats. The estate uses gas street lighting, which is believed to be one of the largest networks in Europe.

==History==

The Park Estate started life as a forested deer park situated immediately to the west of Nottingham Castle. The castle was, from its construction in 1087 until 1663, a royal castle, and the adjoining park a royal park. As well as deer, the park containing fish ponds and a rabbit warren, whilst King Henry II, who was reported to be &#x27;addicted to hunting beyond measure&#x27;, added a falconry. The park would have provided both food and sport for castle residents. After the capture of the castle by parliamentary forces during the English Civil War, the park&#x27;s trees were felled to provide fuel and supplies to the garrison, and in 1651 the castle was slighted.

In 1663, the ruined castle and park was bought by William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle. He initially re-stocked the park with deer, but by the 1720s the area had been given over for cattle grazing. In 1800, whilst Henry Pelham-Clinton, 4th Duke of Newcastle was still a minor, his mother considered disposing of the park. Her agents advised against such a sale as they thought it would depress land values in Nottingham, and they recommended instead a gradual sale of small plots on the periphery of the park. The first domestic building in the park was built in 1809. Built opposite the castle gatehouse, the building served as the vicarage to St. Mary&#x27;s Church.

With the industrialisation of Nottingham in the 19th century, the Park became a valuable open space for local people. Notwithstanding this, and despite much opposition from locals who regarded the area as public land, major development began in 1822 under the 4th Duke. Initially he engaged the architect John Jephson, but in 1825 Jephson was replaced by Peter Frederick Robinson, who published a plan for the park in 1827. The first houses appeared on Park Terrace around 1829 and by 1832 some 40–50 had been completed. Despite this development, in 1849 &quot;The Stranger&#x27;s Guide&quot; noted that the park was &#x27;open to the public and is used as a promenade by all classes of society, and a most healthy appendage it is to a populous and closely built town&#x27;.

Development continued under the 5th Duke, who appointed architect Thomas Chambers Hine in 1854 to design many of the houses and by 1859 houses were complete on Castle Grove, Lenton Road, Newcastle Drive and Clinton Terrace. Hine remained as the architect to the estate, even after the death of the 5th Duke in 1864, when the estate was managed by a trust. Many of the large villas were built for local wealthy industrialists and businessmen, who employed their own architects. The designs for all houses still had to be approved by Hine until he retired in 1891. Hine was also responsible for the construction of the Park Tunnel, intended to provide access for horse-drawn carriages to Derby Road.

By 1918, the estate was largely completed with 355 houses. By the mid 1930s the larger houses were proving difficult to sell. Many of the remaining leases were very short. St Heliers, the former home of Jesse Boot, 1st Baron Trent, which had been unoccupied for 10 years, and was reported as being in good condition, was sold by auction by Walker, Walton and Hanson on 15 June 1932. Originally costing some £6,000, Herbert Weightman of Wilford, a jobbing builder, bought the property for £7 (). The ground rent payable to the Newcastle Estate Office was £116 per year (). There were understood to be covenants in place preventing its demolition, but it was pulled down in 1936.

In 1938, the 8th Duke sold The Park to the Nuffield Trust who then sold it to Oxford University. Between 1940 and 1986 Oxford University sold the freeholds to the owners. The Park was designated a conservation area in 1969. In 1986 negotiations between The Park Residents Association and Oxford University Chest resulted in the ownership of the Estate being transferred to the newly formed Company: The Nottingham Park Estate Limited.

By 2007, all but about a dozen of the 355 original pre-1918 houses still existed, many without any significant external alterations.

==Architecture==

The following table lists the significant properties within the park estate.
===Planning constraints===
The Park is a conservation area with many of the buildings being listed. Planning submissions are subject to detailed planning regulations.

==Residential estate==
===Access===
Access to the estate for vehicles is restricted to three entrances – North Road (off Derby Road), Lenton Road (next to castle) and Peveril Drive (off Castle Boulevard) where registration with The Estate&#x27;s ANPR system is required to operate the rising bollards. There are also two minor entrances – Barrack Lane (off Derby Road) and Newcastle Drive/Park Row (off The Ropewalk) – that provide access to selected parts of the estate, although Barrack Lane itself does not fall within The Park.

There are several pedestrian/cycle entrances which are mostly gated, some of which locked at night. These are: Lenton Road (on to Park Road, Lenton); Lenton Road (next to Rock Drive: a steep walkway to Castle Boulevard); Fish Pond Drive (on to Castle Boulevard); Newcastle Drive (off Canning Circus) and The Park Tunnel which runs from Tunnel Road to Derby Road (near Budgens store) with a staircase halfway along to Upper College Street. There is a gated walkway from Pelham Crescent to Harlaxton Drive, Lenton.

From 1999 to 2013 the pedestrian gate between Lenton Road and Park Road, Lenton was locked every night between the hours of 11 pm and 5 am. The estate management argued this was necessary to reduce late night noise and anti-social behaviour, because the route links student-dominated Lenton to the city centre. A public local inquiry was held in 2013 to consider the legal status of Lenton Road, which ruled that it was a public right of way as a public footpath had been present since at least 1700, so should be added to the council&#x27;s Definitive Map and could not be legally barred with a locked gate. This resulted in the removal of the gate between Lenton Road and Park Road.

===Maintenance arrangements===
The Park is a private estate, managed by Nottingham Park Estate Ltd, a company governed by Act of Parliament. Living on the estate incurs both council tax and a local charge (&#x27;Park Rates&#x27;). The park rates cover maintenance of roads, pavements, the gas light network, the trees and the public green spaces. Residents previously received a reduced council tax bill due to these rates covering services which would usually provided by the council. However, the Park Estate rate is now paid in addition to the full council tax rate.

===Residents&#x27; Association===
The Nottingham Park Residents&#x27; Association (NPRA) holds regular talks and hosts a number of events using the two green spaces in the middle of the estate. They also produce a twice yearly magazine which is delivered, free of charge, to every Park household.

In 2011 the NPRA hosted a street party on the day of the Royal Wedding, and, in 2012, a Diamond Jubilee Street Party. Other events include a picnic for young children based on the Teddy Bear picnic song, a Carol Service and Boule tournament. Every two years in June a number of the gardens are open to the public, with the proceeds being donated to local charities.

<doc id="476786" wikidata="Q312696" url="?curid=476786" title="Mick Taylor">
<text>Michael Kevin Taylor (born 17 January 1949) is an English guitarist, best known as a former member of John Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers (1967–1969) and the Rolling Stones (1969–1974). As a member of the Stones, he appeared on &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; (1969), &quot;Get Yer Ya-Ya&#x27;s Out!&quot; (1970), &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; (1971), &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; (1972), &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; (1973) &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; (1974), and &quot;Tattoo You&quot; (1981). 

Since leaving the Rolling Stones in December 1974, Taylor has worked with numerous other artists and released several solo albums. From November 2012 onwards, he participated in the Stones&#x27; 50th-Anniversary shows in London and Newark, and in the band&#x27;s 50 &amp; Counting tour, which included North America, Glastonbury Festival and Hyde Park in 2013. He was ranked 37th in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2011 list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time. Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Slash states that Taylor has had the biggest influence on him.

==Biography==
===1949–1969: Early life===
Taylor was born to a working-class family in Welwyn Garden City, then raised in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, England, where his father worked as a fitter for the De Havilland aircraft company. He began playing guitar at age nine, learning from his mother&#x27;s younger brother. As a teenager, he formed bands with schoolmates and started performing concerts under names such as the Juniors and the Strangers. They also appeared on television and put out a single. Part of the band was recruited for a new group called the Gods, which included Ken Hensley (later of Uriah Heep fame). In 1966, the Gods opened for Cream at the Starlite Ballroom in Wembley.

On April 18, 1966, at age 17, Taylor went to see a John Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers performance at The Hop, Woodhall Community Centre, Welwyn Garden City, and since Eric Clapton was absent, Taylor got to play in his stead. After playing the second set, and garnering Mayall&#x27;s respect, Taylor left the stage, joined his friends and exited the venue before Mayall could speak with him. Still, this encounter proved pivotal in Taylor&#x27;s career, when Mayall needed someone to fill Peter Green&#x27;s vacancy the following year when Green quit to form Fleetwood Mac. Mayall placed a &#x27;Guitarist Wanted&#x27; advert in the weekly &quot;Melody Maker&quot; music paper, and got a response from Taylor, whom he readily invited to join. Taylor made his debut with the Bluesbreakers at the Manor House, an old blues club in north London. For those in the music scene the night was an event ...&quot;Let&#x27;s go and see this 17-year-old kid try and replace Eric&quot;.

Taylor toured and recorded the album &quot;Crusade&quot; with John Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers. From 1966 to 1969, Taylor developed a guitar style that is blues-based with Latin and jazz influences. He is the guitarist on the Bluesbreaker albums &quot;Crusade&quot;, &quot;Diary of a Band&quot;, &quot;Bare Wires&quot;, and &quot;Blues from Laurel Canyon&quot;. Later in his career, he further developed his skills as a slide guitarist.

===1969–1974: The Rolling Stones===
After Brian Jones and the Rolling Stones parted ways in June 1969, John Mayall and Ian Stewart recommended Taylor to Mick Jagger. Taylor believed he was being called in to be a session musician at his first studio session with the Rolling Stones. An impressed Jagger and Keith Richards invited Taylor back the following day to continue rehearsing and recording with the band. He overdubbed guitar on &quot;Country Honk&quot; and &quot;Live With Me&quot; for the album &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;, and on the single &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot; released in the UK on 4 July 1969.

Taylor&#x27;s onstage debut as a Rolling Stone, at the age of 20, was the free concert in Hyde Park, London on 5 July 1969. An estimated quarter of a million people attended for a show that turned into a tribute to Brian Jones, who had died two days before the concert.

During their 1972 American Tour, Truman Capote profiled members of the band for an ultimately unfinished article for Rolling Stone; he would later describe Taylor to Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show as &quot;pretty, a little Jean Harlow blond-type, but dumb, and totally uninteresting.&quot;

Between recording sessions, the band members were living in various countries as UK income tax exiles, with Taylor himself owing the Inland Revenue £22,000 after having spent less than a year and a half in the band. 

Taylor took the opportunity to work on various side projects during his tenure with the Rolling Stones. In June 1973, he joined Mike Oldfield onstage at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in a performance of Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;. Taylor was asked to take part in this project by Richard Branson, as he felt Oldfield was a relative unknown, having just been signed to Branson&#x27;s fledgling label, Virgin Records. Taylor joined Oldfield once more for a BBC television broadcast in November 1973. Taylor would also perform on the Herbie Mann albums &quot;London Underground&quot; and &quot;Reggae&quot;, both recorded in 1973.

===1973–1975: &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot;===
After the 1973 European tour (during which Taylor had taken to playing alongside opening act Billy Preston), Richards&#x27; drug problems had worsened, and began to compromise the band&#x27;s ability to function. In November 1973, Taylor underwent surgery for acute sinusitis and missed some of the sessions when the band began working on the LP &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; at Musicland Studios in Munich. Tony Sanchez, a photographer and acquaintance, would later allege that this was related to Taylor&#x27;s &quot;ever-increasing&quot; use of cocaine, although Taylor would later dismiss this as &quot;complete rubbish.&quot; Not much was achieved during the first ten days at Musicland, but most of the actual recordings were made there in January 1974, and in April at Stargroves, Jagger&#x27;s estate in Hampshire. When Taylor resumed work with the band, he found it difficult to get along with Richards, who was reportedly abusive, discouraging him from playing and surreptitiously erasing riffs which he had already recorded. Bill Wyman recalled that Taylor began to &quot;get very, very moody and frustrated.&quot; According to Rolling Stones producer Andy Johns, Taylor complained that Jagger and Richards &quot;won&#x27;t let me write any songs. Any time I have an idea I&#x27;m blocked out.&quot; Johns stated that he encouraged Taylor to leave the band, and that although Taylor &quot;would have left anyway&quot;, he blamed himself for instigating it. &quot;It was the worst thing I ever did. It wasn&#x27;t a smart move...though they were jolly surprised when he quit. &#x27;What is he, insane? No one&#x27;s ever left us before!&quot;

Not long after those recording sessions, Taylor went on a six-week expedition to Brazil, travelling down the Amazon River in a boat and exploring Latin music. Just before the release of the album in October 1974, Taylor told music journalist Nick Kent from the &quot;NME&quot; about the new LP and that he had co-written &quot;Till the Next Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Time Waits for No One&quot; with Jagger. Kent told Taylor he had seen the finished artwork for the sleeve, which revealed the absence of any songwriting credits for Taylor, who &quot;went silent for a second before muttering a curt &#x27;We&#x27;ll see about that!&quot; almost under his breath. Actually, he sounded more resigned that anything else&quot;. Kent claimed that Taylor&#x27;s wife had encouraged him to leave the band, and dismissively stated that Taylor &quot;felt he should get songwriting credits because Keith hadn&#x27;t turned up to a few sessions and he&#x27;d done a few riffs with Jagger,&quot; while Richards claimed that Taylor &quot;never really wrote things, in spite of what he said&quot;, and that he could have resolved his creative frustrations and engaged in solo projects while still remaining a part of the band.

However, at the time, Taylor, who was apparently &quot;determined to leave with a minimum of fuss&quot;, claimed that there &quot;was no personal animosity in the split&quot;, and that his decision &quot;had nothing whatsoever to do&quot; with credits and royalties. 

Taylor&#x27;s last broadcast appearance with the Rolling Stones before his departure was in the promotional videos for &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll (But I Like It)&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud to Beg&quot;.

In December 1974, Taylor announced he was leaving the Rolling Stones. He was attending a party hosted by Eric Clapton in London with Mick Jagger, Ronnie Wood and record producer Marshall Chess. At some point, Taylor allegedly told Jagger he was quitting the band and walked out. Taylor&#x27;s decision came as a shock to many. The Rolling Stones were due to start recording a new album in Munich, and the entire band was reportedly angry at Taylor for leaving at such short notice. Jagger claimed that he &quot;received a call from the office that Mick Taylor wasn&#x27;t coming to the Munich sessions. Then I received a call saying Mick Taylor wasn&#x27;t going anywhere anymore with the Stones.&quot; In response to questions about who would replace Taylor, Jagger spitefully commented: &quot;No doubt we can find a brilliant six foot, three inch blond guitarist who can do his own makeup.&quot; Jagger later stated that &quot; I suppose it was a bit inconsiderate of him to inform us a day before we were about to enter the studios...but maybe he hadn&#x27;t made up his mind until that point&quot;. Bill Wyman claimed that &quot;It was a very inconvenient time [...] I didn&#x27;t think he did it very politely.&quot; Richards allegedly sent Taylor a telegram the day after he left the band, stating: &quot;&#x27;Really enjoyed playing with you for the last five years. Thanks for all the turn-ons. Best wishes and love.&#x27;&quot; According to his wife, Rose, &quot;Mick just read it and started crying.&quot;&quot; Taylor&#x27;s departure was officially announced on 12 and 16 December 1974: &quot;After five and a half years Mick [Taylor] wishes a change of scene—wants the opportunity to try out new ventures, new endeavours. While we are all most sorry that he is going, we wish him great success and much happiness&quot;. Taylor made a statement to the press:

However, Taylor would later reveal that behind the scenes, things were more complicated:

When interviewed by Jann Wenner of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1995, Wenner wrote that Jagger had stated that Taylor never explained why he had left, and surmised that &quot;[Taylor] wanted to have a solo career. I think he found it difficult to get on with Keith.&quot; In the same Wenner interview, Jagger had reportedly said of Taylor&#x27;s contribution to the band: &quot;I think he had a big contribution. He made it very musical. He was a very fluent, melodic player, which we never had, and we don&#x27;t have now. Neither Keith nor Ronnie Wood (who replaced Taylor) plays that kind of style. It was very good for me working with him ... Mick Taylor would play very fluid lines against my vocals. He was exciting, and he was very pretty, and it gave me something to follow, to bang off. Some people think that&#x27;s the best version of the band that existed&quot;. Asked if he agreed with that assessment, Jagger said: &quot;I obviously can&#x27;t say if I think Mick Taylor was the best, because it sort of trashes the period the band is in now.&quot; Charlie Watts stated: &quot;I think we chose the right man for the job at that time just as Ronnie was the right man for the job later on. I still think Mick is great. I haven&#x27;t heard or seen him play in a few years. But certainly what came out of playing with him are musically some of the best things we&#x27;ve ever done&quot;. In an October 2002 &quot;Guitar World&quot; interview, Richards reflected on his relationship with Taylor: &quot;Mick Taylor and I worked really well together ... He had some lovely energy. Sweetly sophisticated playing, way beyond his years. Lovely sense of melody. I never understood why he left the Stones. Nor does he, I think ... I had no desire to see him go.&quot; Taylor later admitted in the 2012 documentary &quot;Crossfire Hurricane&quot; that he left because he wanted to protect his family from the drug culture surrounding the band. He further stated that in order to stay alive and fight his own demons (Taylor had turned into a drug addict himself by 1973), he needed to escape the realm of the Stones.

In an essay about the Rolling Stones published after Taylor&#x27;s resignation, &quot;The New York Times&quot; music critic Robert Palmer wrote that &quot;Taylor is the most accomplished technician who ever served as a Stone. A blues guitarist with a jazzman&#x27;s flair for melodic invention, Taylor was never a rock and roller and never a showman.&quot;

Taylor has worked with his former bandmates on various occasions since leaving the Rolling Stones. In 1977 he attended London-based sessions for the John Phillips album &quot;Pay Pack &amp; Follow&quot;, appearing on several tracks alongside Jagger (vocals), Richards (guitar) and Wood (bass).

On 14 December 1981 he performed with the band during their concert at Kemper Arena in Kansas City, Missouri. Richards appeared on stage at a Mick Taylor show at the Lone Star Cafe in New York on 28 December 1986, jamming on &quot;Key to the Highway&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t You Hear Me Knocking&quot;; and Taylor is featured on one track (&quot;I Could Have Stood You Up&quot;) on Richards&#x27; 1988 album &quot;Talk is Cheap&quot;. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted Taylor along with the Rolling Stones in 1989. Taylor also worked with Bill Wyman&#x27;s Rhythm Kings in the early 1990s.

In addition to his contributions to Rolling Stones albums released during his tenure with the band, Taylor&#x27;s guitar is also on two tracks on their 1981 release &quot;Tattoo You&quot;: &quot;Tops&quot; and &quot;Waiting on a Friend&quot;, which were recorded in 1972. (Taylor is sometimes mistakenly credited as playing on &quot;Worried About You&quot;, but the solo on that track is performed by Wayne Perkins.)

Taylor&#x27;s onstage presence with the Rolling Stones is preserved on the album &quot;Get Yer Ya-Ya&#x27;s Out!&quot;, recorded over four concerts at Madison Square Garden in New York and the Baltimore Civic Center in November 1969, and on the album &quot;Brussels Affair (Live 1973)&quot;, compiled from two shows recorded in Brussels on 17 October 1973 in the Forest National Arena, during their European Tour. Taylor&#x27;s live performances also feature in the documentary films &quot;Stones in the Park&quot; (released on DVD in 2001), &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; (released in 1970) and &quot;Cocksucker Blues&quot; (unreleased); and in the concert film &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones&quot; (shown in cinemas in 1974, and released on DVD and Blu-ray in 2010); these performances were also released on an album with the same title. Bootleg recordings from the Rolling Stones&#x27; tours from 1969 through 1973 also document Taylor&#x27;s concert performances with the Rolling Stones.

For the 2010 re-release of &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; Taylor worked with Jagger at a London studio in November 2009 to record new guitar and vocal parts for the previously unreleased song, &quot;Plundered My Soul&quot;. The track was selected by the Rolling Stones for release as a limited edition single on Record Store Day.

On 24 October 2012, the Rolling Stones announced, via their latest &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine interview, that Bill Wyman and Mick Taylor were expected to join the Rolling Stones on stage at the upcoming November shows in London. Richards went on to say that the pair would strictly be guests. At the two London shows on 25 and 29 November, Taylor played on &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot;.

During an interview on the &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; show (broadcast on 8 April 2013), Richards stated that Taylor would be performing with the Stones for their upcoming 2013 tour dates. Between 25 November 2012 and 13 July 2013 Taylor joined the Stones&#x27; 50 &amp; Counting Tour performing at each of the 30 shows across Europe and North America, including sitting in on four songs at the Staples Center in Los Angeles and several numbers during their headline set at the Glastonbury Festival. The tour ended with two concerts at Hyde Park, London, which resulted in the album, &quot;Hyde Park Live&quot; and the concert film &quot;Sweet Summer Sun: Live in Hyde Park&quot;. He once again accompanied the Stones between 21 February and 22 November 2014 for the 29 dates of the 14 On Fire concerts across Asia, Europe and Australia/New Zealand.

===1975–1981: Post-Stones===
After his resignation from the Rolling Stones, Taylor was invited by Jack Bruce to form a new band with keyboardist Carla Bley and drummer Bruce Gary. In 1975 the band began rehearsals in London with tour dates scheduled for later that year. The group toured Europe, with a sound leaning more toward jazz, including a performance at the Dutch Pinkpop Festival, but disbanded the following year. A performance, recorded on 1 June 1975 (which was finally released on CD in 2003 as &quot;Live at the Manchester Free Trade Hall&quot; by The Jack Bruce Band), and another performance from &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;, seem to be the only material available from this brief collaboration. Tony Sanchez claimed to have encountered Taylor some time after he left the Rolling Stones &quot;living with a lady who pushed cocaine for a living&quot;, and that &quot;he had been reduced to selling off his gold discs.&quot;

Taylor appeared as a special guest of Little Feat at London&#x27;s Rainbow Theatre in 1977, sharing slide guitar with then-frontman Lowell George on &quot;A Apolitical Blues&quot;: this song appears on Little Feat&#x27;s critically acclaimed live album &quot;Waiting for Columbus&quot;.

In the summer of 1977, Taylor collaborated with Pierre Moerlen&#x27;s Gong for the album &quot;Expresso II&quot;, released in 1978. Taylor began writing new songs and recruiting musicians for a solo album and worked on projects with Miller Anderson, Alan Merrill and others. He was present at many of the recording sessions for John Phillips&#x27; prospective second solo album. The recordings for Phillips&#x27; LP took place in London over a prolonged period between 1973 and 1977. This led to Taylor working with Keith Richards and Mick Jagger who were also involved with the album. The LP was to be released on the Stones&#x27; own label Rolling Stones Records (distributed by Atlantic Records). Ahmet Ertegun decided to pull the plug on the project after hearing alarming reports of excessive drug use by Phillips and Richards, but bootleg recordings of the sessions circulated among fans under the titles &quot;Half Stoned&quot; and &quot;Phillips &#x27;77&quot;. Eventually Eagle Rock Records made funds available to restore the original, rescued tapes and the album finally saw an official release in 2002 as &quot;Pay Pack &amp; Follow&quot;.
In 1977 Taylor signed a solo recording deal with Columbia Records. By April 1978 he had given several interviews to music magazines to promote a new, completed album which mixed rock, jazz and Latin-flavoured blues musical styles. The album, titled &quot;Mick Taylor&quot;, was finally released by Columbia Records in 1979 and reached No.119 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in early August, with a stay of five weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. CBS advised Taylor to promote the album through American radio stations but was unwilling to back him for any supporting tour. Frustrated with this situation, Taylor took a break from the music industry for about a year.

In 1981 he toured Europe and the United States with Alvin Lee of Ten Years After, sharing the bill with Black Sabbath. He spent most of 1982 and 1983 on the road with John Mayall, for the &quot;Reunion Tour&quot; with John McVie of Fleetwood Mac and Colin Allen. During this tour Bob Dylan showed up backstage at The Roxy in Los Angeles to meet Taylor.

In 1983,Taylor joined Mark Knopfler and played on Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Infidels&quot; album. He also appeared on Dylan&#x27;s live album &quot;Real Live&quot;, as well as the follow-up studio album &quot;Empire Burlesque&quot;. In 1984, Dylan asked Taylor to assemble an experienced rock and roll band for a European tour he signed with Bill Graham. Ian McLagan was hired to play piano and Hammond organ, Greg Sutton to play bass and Colin Allen, a long-time friend of Taylor, on drums. The tour lasted for four weeks at venues such as Munich&#x27;s Olympic Stadium Arena and Milan&#x27;s San Siro Stadium, sharing the bill with Carlos Santana and Joan Baez, who appeared on the same bill for a couple of shows.

===1988–present===

Taylor performed the lead guitar solo on the 1988 Joan Jett &amp; the Blackhearts top-10 single, &quot;I Hate Myself for Loving You&quot;. Taylor guested with the Grateful Dead on 24 September 1988 at the last show of that year&#x27;s Madison Square Garden run in New York. Taylor lived in New York throughout the 1980s. He battled with addiction problems before getting back on track in the second half of the 1980s and moving to Los Angeles in 1990. During this time Taylor did session work and toured in Europe, America and Japan with a band including; either Eric Parker or Bernard Purdie on drums, Wilbur Bascomb on bass, Max Middleton (formerly of the Jeff Beck Group), Shane Fontayne, and Blondie Chaplin. He also played on the Dramarama album &quot;Vinyl&quot;, a throwback to classic rock that Taylor was an important part of from the previous decade, playing all guitar tracks, which, ironically, included The Rolling Stones slide guitar song &quot;Memo From Turner&quot;. In 1990, his CD &quot;Stranger in This Town&quot; was released by Maze Records, backed up by a mini-tour including the record release party at the Hard Rock Cafe as well as gigs at the Paradise Theater.

He began what was to be a significant series of collaborations with Los Angeles based Carla Olson with their &quot;Live at the Roxy&quot; album &quot;Too Hot For Snakes&quot;, the centrepiece of which is an extended seven-minute performance of &quot;Sway&quot;. Another highlight is the lead track on the album, &quot;Who Put the Sting (On the Honey Bee)&quot;, by Olson&#x27;s then-bassist Jesse Sublett. It was followed by Olson&#x27;s &quot;Within An Ace&quot;, which featured Taylor on seven songs. He appeared on three songs from &quot;Reap The Whirlwind&quot; and then again on Olson&#x27;s &quot;The Ring of Truth&quot;, on which he plays lead guitar on nine tracks, including a twelve-minute version of the song &quot;Winter&quot;. Further work by Olson and Taylor can be heard on the Olson-produced Barry Goldberg album &quot;Stoned Again&quot;. Taylor went on to appear on Percy Sledge&#x27;s &quot;Blue Night&quot; (1994), along with Steve Cropper, Bobby Womack and Greg Leisz.

After spending two years as a resident of Miami, during which time he played with a band called &#x27;Tumbling Dice&#x27; featuring Bobby Keys, Nicky Hopkins and others, Taylor moved back to England in the mid-1990s. He released a new album in 1998 entitled &quot;A Stone&#x27;s Throw&quot;. Playing at clubs and theatres as well as appearing at festivals has kept Taylor connected with an appreciative audience and fan base.

In 2003, Taylor reunited with John Mayall for his 70th Birthday Concert in Liverpool along with Eric Clapton. A year later, in autumn 2004, he also joined John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers for a UK theatre tour. He toured the US East Coast with the Experience Hendrix group during October 2007. The Experience Hendrix group appeared at a series of concerts to honour Jimi Hendrix and his musical legacy. Players included Taylor, Mitch Mitchell, Billy Cox, Buddy Guy, Hubert Sumlin and Robby Krieger.

On 1 December 2010, Taylor reunited with Ronnie Wood at a benefit gig arranged by blues guitarist Stephen Dale Petit to save the 100 Club in London. Other special guests at the show were Dick Taylor (first bassist in the Rolling Stones) and blues/jazz trombonist Chris Barber. Taylor toured the UK with Petit, appearing as his special guest, featured on a Paul Jones BBC Radio 2 session with him and guested on Petit&#x27;s 2010 album, &quot;The Crave&quot;.

Taylor also helped to promote the &quot;Boogie for Stu&quot; album, recorded by Ben Waters to honour Ian Stewart (original Stones pianist and co-founder of the band), by taking part in a concert to mark the CD&#x27;s official launch at the Ambassadors Theatre, London on 9 March 2011. Proceeds from the event were donated to the British Heart Foundation. Although Jagger and Richards didn&#x27;t show up, Taylor noticeably enjoyed performing with Watts, Wood and Wyman, among others. In 2012, Taylor rejoined the Rolling Stones as a special guest on their 50 &amp; Counting Tour, typically performing &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot; in a prominent lead guitar role.

Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Slash states that Taylor had the biggest influence on him.

==Equipment==
Throughout his career, Taylor has used various guitars, but is mostly associated with the Gibson Les Paul. His first Les Paul was bought when he was still playing with The Gods (from Selmer&#x27;s, London in &#x27;65). He acquired his second Les Paul in 1967, not long after joining The Bluesbreakers: Taylor came to Olympic Studios to buy a Les Paul that Keith Richards wanted to sell. On the &#x27;72/&#x27;73 tours Taylor used a couple of Sunburst Les Paul guitars without a Bigsby. Other guitars include a Gibson ES-355 for the recording of &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; and &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;, a Gibson SG on the 1969, 1970 and 1971 tours. and occasionally a Fender Stratocaster and a Fender Telecaster.. For the instructional DVD, &quot;Mick Taylor: Rock Blues and Slide Guitar&quot;, he uses a Stratocaster. He started using the Vigier Excalibur in 1997.

Though Taylor is primarily known as an electric guitarist he has also contributed acoustic guitar, bass guitar, backing vocals, keyboards and synthesizers to solo and guest recordings.

Taylor has been married twice and has two daughters. Chloe (born 6 January 1971) is a daughter by his first wife, Rose Millar (sister of Robin Millar). Taylor married Millar in 1975 after leaving the Stones, but the relationship was reportedly &quot;in tatters&quot; before long and resulted in divorce only a few years later. Taylor&#x27;s daughter, Emma, was born from a short relationship with an American woman, Susan McMinamin, who sang backing vocals with Taylor&#x27;s band on one occasion. Taylor is in a relationship with Marlies Damming. They live in Damming&#x27;s homecountry of the Netherlands.

<doc id="476797" wikidata="Q1142783" url="?curid=476797" title="Just for Laughs Gags">
<text>Just for Laughs Gags (French: Les Gags) is a Canadian silent comedy/hidden camera reality television series that is under the Just for Laughs brand created by Pierre Girard and Jacques Chevalier.

The series uses a hidden camera format, playing pranks on unsuspecting subjects while hidden cameras capture the subjects&#x27; responses; each episode presents multiple gags. While some segments have included brief dialogue, most do not contain any sound or dialogue. The audio is replaced with sound effects, a laugh track, and music.

== Production ==
On 21 December 2000, &quot;Just for Laughs Gags&quot; began airing on French Canadian network Canal D. In the following years, the show was picked up by TVA, CBC and The Comedy Network in Canada, BBC1 in the UK, TF1 in France, and ABC and Telemundo and also Laff in the United States; the Canadian version (unlike the ones produced for ABC) aired in the United States in first-run syndication starting in the fall of 2015. That version is distributed by PPI Partners and is available in both weekday strip and weekend runs.

Most segments are filmed in Montreal, while some have been filmed in Quebec City, Vancouver and Mexico. British and Asian versions have been produced in the UK and Singapore, respectively. In 2011, the show spawned a spin-off, &quot;Just Kidding&quot;, which consists exclusively of kids playing pranks on adults.

== Reception ==

With its silent format and no translation required (outside of gag set-up commentary which is easily localised), in three years &quot;Just for Laughs Gags&quot; reached 70 countries and by 2015 had been purchased for use in over 130 countries throughout the world as well as in airports and by airlines.

Reactions to the gags range from &quot;inane&quot; to cross-culturally funny. The same distributors also distribute &quot;Surprise Sur Prise&quot;, a similar show.

Bruce Hills, who is COO of the company responsible for the show, thinks that the reason why it is in demand among TV channels is because of its feature of expressing to audiences without language.

==&quot;Just for Laughs&quot; (American TV series)==
Just for Laughs is an American sketch comedy show hosted by Rick Miller produced by Dakota Pictures that shows clips from the Canadian version of the show.

Good ratings during the summer airings in 2007 and a writer&#x27;s union strike resulted in ABC adding the show to the network lineup as a mid-season replacement for 2007–08.

It returned to the schedule on 1 January 2008, before being cancelled on 12 May 2008. On 4 June 2009, it was announced that a third season would begin airing on 21 June 2009.

Program Partners brought the show back to the United States for a fourth season beginning in fall 2015; this season aired in first-run syndication.

===Seasonal Nielsen ratings===
Seasonal ratings based on average total viewers per episode of &quot;Just for Laughs&quot; on ABC:
====Season 1 (2007)====
====Season 2 (2008)====
====Season 3 (2009)====
==YouTube channel==
The show has an official YouTube channel. As of February 2024, the channel had at least 7.6K videos.

==Lawsuit==
In 2014, an 83-year-old woman was preparing to sue &quot;Just for Laughs&quot; for child related pranking.

<doc id="476804" wikidata="Q2468622" url="?curid=476804" title="Whatstandwell">
<text>Whatstandwell () is a village on the River Derwent in the Amber Valley district of Derbyshire, England.
It is about five miles south of Matlock and about four miles north of Belper. Whatstandwell railway station is on the Derby–Matlock Derwent Valley Line, and the A6 trunk road crosses the River Derwent in the village. Most of the population is included in the civil parish of Crich but the village may be said to extend across the Derwent into the parish of Alderwasley.

==History==
On Peter Perez Burdett&#x27;s map of 1791, it is shown as &#x27;Hottstandell Bridge&#x27;, probably a literal spelling of the local dialect. A mid-19th-century Ordnance Survey map shows it as &#x27;Whatstandwell Bridge&#x27; which was the name given to the railway station. The name derives from Walter Stonewell, who &quot;held of the convent&quot; the house next to the bridge which John de Strepul built at his own expense, in 1393.

==Geography==
The Cromford Canal passes through the village, which was an important transport route to and from Arkwright&#x27;s Cromford Mill in the 19th century. The Friends Of Cromford Canal are currently seeking to reopen this navigation in full from Cromford to its junction with the Erewash Canal at Langley Mill. This area is part of the Derwent Valley Mills Heritage Site.

To the east of the village is the steep climb to Crich and the National Tramway Museum, while a short distance to the north is the former rope-worked incline of the Cromford and High Peak Railway. To the south, on the west bank of the Derwent, lies Shining Cliff Woods, owned and managed by the Grith Pioneers.

==Culture and community==
The village has an active social group that holds several village events each year. The flagship of these is the Whatstandwell Festival held across the valley at Hankin Farm in the middle of June. This features locally brewed real ale, local bands, games and a BBQ. The social group also organises a horticultural show, bonfire night, and a carol concert. The once-annual raft race was abandoned because of a lack of support and access issues.

There were two pubs at the turn of the century, but the Wheatsheaf is now a private residence, and the Derwent Hotel is a cafe/restaurant called the Family Tree.

Whatstandwell is mentioned in the D. H. Lawrence novel &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot;, published in 1913, in a scene in which Paul Morel and Miriam go on a day&#x27;s outing: &quot;They went on, miles and miles, to Whatstandwell. All the food was eaten, everybody was hungry, and there was very little money to get home with. But they managed to procure a loaf and a currant-loaf, which they hacked to pieces with shut knives, and ate sitting on the wall near the bridge, watching the bright Derwent rushing by, and the brakes from Matlock pulling up at the inn.&quot;

Ellen MacArthur, the round-the-world sailor, grew up in Whatstandwell.

Ken Smith, the subject of the Scottish BAFTA-winning film &quot;The Hermit of Treig&quot;, was born in the village. His book &quot;The Way of the Hermit&quot;, published by Pan McMillan ISBN 9781035009817 describes his childhood in the village.

<text>Ryan Gibson Anderson (born 1978), is an American former Washington State National Guardsman convicted by court-martial on September 3, 2004, on five counts of attempting to provide aid to the terrorist network al-Qaeda. He is currently serving a life sentence in the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas with the eligibility of parole.

Anderson was a tank crewman and held the rank of Specialist (E-4). He was assigned to the 81st Armored Brigade of the Washington Army National Guard and was preparing for deployment to Iraq when he was arrested in a joint FBI and United States Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) sting operation on February 12, 2004. At the time of the court-martial verdict, the jury of nine commissioned officers reduced Anderson&#x27;s rank to private and gave him a dishonorable discharge.

== Background ==

Anderson was born and raised in Everett, Washington. He attended Cascade High School. He then attended Washington State University and majored in history, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 2002. Anderson was married on April 5, 2003, to Erin Wheatley. They met while both attending Washington State University. Erin graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications, also in 2002. She then moved to Kansas to be closer to her incarcerated husband, attended the University of Missouri-Kansas City from 2007 to 2009 and graduated with a Master&#x27;s in counseling and guidance.

In 1999, Anderson converted to Islam and adopted the name Amir Abdul Rashid. Prior to his capture, Anderson was seen on a surveillance tape, in which he said, &quot;I wish to desert from the U.S. Army. I wish to defect from the United States. I wish to join al-Qaeda, train its members and conduct terrorist attacks&quot;.&quot;&quot;

== Arrest ==

Anderson was arrested February 12, 2004 after a joint investigation by the United States Army Counterintelligence, and the FBI. They monitored his online activities, such as logging onto extremist Internet chat rooms, trying to get in touch with al-Qaeda operatives, and offering the organization information on United States military capabilities and weaponry. Shortly before his arrest, Anderson was recorded on video surveillance providing tactical information on methods of killing U.S. troops and destroying tanks to undercover agents posing as al-Qaeda operatives. They tapped his and his wife&#x27;s cell phones, pulled text messages, and followed both him and his wife in their daily lives.

Shannen Rossmiller, a former municipal judge in Conrad, Montana and amateur cyber spy, is credited with first encountering Anderson in an online Islamist chat room. In posts, Anderson offered assistance in gathering information and in killing U.S. soldiers. After ascertaining that Anderson was a member of the U.S. military, Rossmiller contacted the FBI who set up a joint sting operation with the United States Department of Justice and the military.

== Court-martial ==
On September 2, 2004, a military jury found Anderson guilty of five counts of attempting to aid and provide intelligence to the enemy. In his defense, Anderson&#x27;s lawyers made an insanity plea, offering medical testimony that he has bipolar disorder and Asperger syndrome. They also claimed that he used role-playing to create structure in his life, therefore inducing him into the entrapment created by the authorities. He was given a demotion to the rank of private, a dishonorable discharge, and sentenced to a life sentence, with the possibility of parole.

<text>Therese Brandl (1 February 1902 – 24 January 1948) was a Nazi concentration camp guard.

In March 1942, Brandl was among the SS women assigned to Auschwitz I concentration camp. Her duties included watching over women in the sorting sheds and as the &quot;SS Rapportaufseherin&quot;. In October 1942, she was posted to the newly opened Auschwitz II extermination camp at Birkenau. Brandl was convicted of crimes against humanity after the war during the Auschwitz Trial in Kraków and executed.

==Career==
Born in Staudach-Egerndach, Bavaria, Brandl was posted to Ravensbrück concentration camp in March 1940 to begin her training under &quot;SS-Oberaufseherin&quot; Johanna Langefeld. Sent to Auschwitz I during March 1942, Brandl was employed in the laundry and soon rose through the ranks and became an &quot;Erstaufseherin&quot; (First Guard) directly under Margot Dreschel and Maria Mandl. In July 1944, she received the War Merit Cross from the Reich for her &quot;good conduct&quot; in the camps.

She took part in selections of women and children to be murdered in the gas chambers as well as physically abusing prisoners, including children, as Andreas Larinciakos, a nine-year-old boy from Cles, Italy, recalled: &quot;In November 1944, all children were transferred to Camp A, the gypsy camp. When they counted us, one was found missing, so Mandl, manageress of the women&#x27;s camp and her assistant, Brandl, drove us out into the street at one in the morning and made us stand there in the frost until noon the next day&quot;.

In November 1944, with the approach of the Soviet Army, she was assigned to the Mühldorf concentration camp complex, subcamp of Dachau along with Mandl and was demoted to &quot;Aufseherin&quot;. Few reports have surfaced about Brandl&#x27;s behavior at Mühldorf. She ultimately fled from Mühldorf on 27 April 1945, weeks before the arrival of the United States Army.

On 29 August 1945, the U.S. Army arrested her in the Bavarian mountains of Germany and sent her to a holding camp to await questioning. In November 1947, she was tried by the Polish authorities along with Mandl, Luise Danz, Hildegard Lächert, and Alice Orlowski at the Auschwitz Trial in Kraków. On 22 December 1947, Brandl was convicted of participating in the selection of inmates to be murdered. She was hanged in prison on 24 January 1948, about a week before her 46th birthday.

<doc id="476809" wikidata="Q1723642" url="?curid=476809" title="Kanata, Ontario">
<text>Kanata (, ) is a suburb and former city within Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is located about west of the city&#x27;s downtown core. As of 2021, the former City of Kanata had a population of 98,938, with the population centre (which includes next-door Stittsville) having a population of 137,118. Before it was amalgamated into Ottawa in 2001, it was one of the fastest-growing cities in Canada and the fastest-growing community in Eastern Ontario. Located just to the west of the National Capital Commission Greenbelt, it is one of the largest of several communities that surround central Ottawa.

== History ==

The area that is today Kanata was originally part of the March Township, and was first settled by Europeans in the early 19th century. One site dating from this era is Pinhey&#x27;s Point.

It remained mainly agricultural until the 1960s when it became the site of heavy development. Modern Kanata is largely the creation of Bill Teron, a developer and urban planner who purchased over of rural land and set about building a model community. Unlike other suburbs, Kanata was designed to have a mix of densities and commercial and residential properties. It had large amounts of open space, and was to be surrounded by a greenbelt. A reflection of the garden city movement, the area was divided into a series of communities, each of which was intended to have its own commercial centre and unique culture. These include Beaverbrook, Glen Cairn, Bridlewood, Katimavik, Hazeldean, Morgan&#x27;s Grant, and Kanata Lakes. The first street to be built was Tiffany Crescent in 1964.

As part of the overall plan for the city&#x27;s future, Teron set aside land for a technology park, reasoning that the city could grow a high-tech sector on the foundation of the scientists and researchers already attracted to the area for the dominant government sector in Ottawa. To attract the first high-tech companies to the new city, he offered land to the first technology companies to settle in Kanata at no cost other than the price of servicing, attracting Atomic Energy Canada, Northern Electric and Mitel.

The community grew rapidly due to the influx of hi-tech workers looking to capitalize on the new economic opportunities. The Province of Ontario incorporated Kanata as a city in 1978. The new city&#x27;s area was formed out of March Township as well as portions of Goulbourn Township and Nepean. The name &quot;Kanata&quot; was chosen in a referendum, defeating &quot;Hazeldean&quot;, &quot;March&quot; and &quot;Kairnwood&quot;.

On September 20, 1998, the city of Kanata dedicated a cenotaph in Village Green Memorial Park to those who served their country in war and peace.

Kanata remained a city until 2001, when the province created a new (amalgamated) City of Ottawa that included the City of Kanata (pop. 59,700).

The Kanata Avenue–Castlefrank Road overpass next to Royal Canadian Legion National Headquarters, opened in December 2003 and renamed Valour Bridge on December 1, 2006, is dedicated to all Canadians who have served in defence of freedoms in the great battles and campaigns since the turn of the 20th century.

As of the 2006 census, the population of Kanata had increased to 85,000, and was most recently estimated to be just over 90,000. The city became an important hi-tech centre. DEC was one of the pioneer technology companies in Kanata. The DEC campus was later used by Compaq and Hewlett-Packard, and is now occupied by Gilmore Printing. Kanata remains home to many of the major hi-tech employers of Ottawa, such as Ericsson, Avaya, Juniper Networks, Research In Motion, Mitel, March Networks, Nokia, Bridgewater Systems, DragonWave, Solace, Protecode, Dell Canada, HP, Smart Technologies, Norpak, MDS Nordion, Breconridge, AMCC, Cisco, and Ciena. Nortel Networks and the former Bell-Northern Research had a large campus of buildings just outside the Kanata boundary to the east. The hi-tech industry is clustered along March Road, in the Kanata North Business Park and Kanata Research Park, and along Eagleson Road, in the Kanata South Business Park.

== Geography ==
Situated in the Ottawa Valley, Kanata is about west-southwest of Downtown Ottawa along Highway 417 at a latitude of 45°18&#x27; North and a longitude of 75°55&#x27; West, with an area of . Its northern end is just to the west of the Ottawa River.

To the east, Kanata is separated from the former City of Nepean by the National Capital Commission&#x27;s Greenbelt. The community of Bells Corners borders the inner side of the Greenbelt. Bells Corners is itself a hi-tech suburb that was established around 1950, and was home to such Canadian technology icons as Computing Devices Canada, the Ottawa-based defence electronics company (bought by General Dynamics).

Running through the western part of Kanata is the Carp River. Immediately southwest of Kanata are the suburbs of Stittsville and Richmond which are also part of the City of Ottawa. A growing number of people employed in the hi-tech industry reside in the communities of Richmond and Stittsville owing to their close proximity to the larger tech hub of Kanata.

== Main neighbourhoods (North to South) ==

South March: This area of Kanata is north of the Kanata North Business Park on either side of March Road and is bounded by Terry Fox Drive to the south and the urban boundary, which basically runs along the Old Carp Road to the north. Extensive developments are underway towards the north. The development area along the west side of March Road is often referred to as Morgan&#x27;s Grant, while the development area along the east side of March Road can be referred to as Briarbrook, Briar Ridge and Brookside (depending on what area one is referring to). Many developers have developed the land along the east side.
Kanata North Business Park: Frequently referred to as Silicon Valley North during the late 1990s, this area is bounded by Terry Fox Drive to the north, Herzberg Road to the east, March Road to the south and Goulbourn Forced Road to the west. Many high-tech companies reside in this area including MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates, BlackBerry, Nokia, Dell, Mitel, Bridgewater Systems, Solace, AMD, Protecode, Inphi Corporation, Ciena, and Cisco. The 18-story, luxury Brookstreet Hotel is in the middle of the Kanata Research Park, surrounded by the first of two urban 18-hole golf courses, called the Marshes Golf Club. Unlike the members-only Kanata Lakes Golf &amp; Country Club, the Marshes Golf Club is open to the general public.

Marchwood Lakeside : Frequently referred to as Kanata Lakes, this area is bounded by Campeau Drive to the south, Knudson Avenue &amp; Weslock Way to the east, Terry Fox Drive to the west and Terry Fox Drive to the north. It has a main arterial street called Kanata Ave. which runs north–south all the way to the 417 (where it then switches to Castlefrank Road that continues south past Glen Cairn). This area has the second of two urban, 18-hole golf courses in Kanata. Unlike the Marshes Golf Course in the Kanata North Business Park, this golf course is not open to the public.

Beaverbrook: Bounded by the Kanata North Business Park to the north, March Road to the east, Campeau Drive to the south and Knudson Avenue &amp; Weslock Way to the west. The first and oldest neighbourhood in Kanata, Beaverbrook is known for its hedged houses and community facilities. Beaverbrook is also home to Canadian businessman Terry Matthews.

Kanata Town Centre: Bounded by Campeau Drive to the north, March Road to the east, Katimavik Road to the south and Terry Fox Drive to the west. The provincial highway 417 bisects this neighbourhood, with most of the undeveloped areas on the north side of the 417. North of the 417, this area has a large mix of high density homes (townhomes and stacked townhomes) to the east, as well as Kanata&#x27;s major shopping area called Kanata Entertainment Centrum which houses many big-box stores, as well as Landmark Cinemas and its own shopping centre. Between the commercial development and the residential developments to the east, there is a large undeveloped area zoned for high density residential, institutional and commercial spaces. South of the 417, this area again has a mix of residential, institutional and commercial spaces, although the amount of commercial spaces seems to have moved to the newer section of Kanata Town Centre, north of the 417. Again, most of the high density homes are to the east, mainly consisting of townhome developments. As one ventures further to the west, towards Terry Fox Drive, the residential switches from townhomes developments to single family homes.

Terry Fox Business Park: Bounded by the provincial highway 417 &amp; Terry Fox Drive to the north, Terry Fox Drive to the east, Maple Grove Road to the south and Huntmar Drive to the west. Canadian Tire Centre, home arena of the Ottawa Senators, is in the neighbourhood, as well as many newer big-box stores such as Home Depot, Staples, Canadian Tire and more recently Costco. The Bell Sensplex is also in this area, providing Kanata with an additional Olympic sized rink, three NHL sized rinks and an indoor soccer/lacrosse field.

Katimavik-Hazeldean: Bounded by Katimavik Road to the north, Eagleson Road to the east, by Hazeldean Road to the south and Terry Fox Drive to the west.

Glen Cairn: Bounded by Hazeldean Road to the north, Eagleson Road to the east, the Trans Canada Trail to the south, and Terry Fox Drive to the west. Glen Cairn features some low income housing, and is one of the oldest neighbourhoods in Kanata, along with Beaverbrook.

Kanata South Business Park: Bounded by the Trans Canada Trail to the north, Eagleson Road to the east, Fernbank Road to the south and Terry Fox Drive to the west. Again, many smaller high-tech companies are home to the KSBP. Most of this area was undeveloped until just recently. A Real Canadian Superstore recently opened and a large residential/small office development is under construction in the south end of the KSBP.

Bridlewood: Bounded by the National Capital Commission Green Belt to the north and east, Hope Side Road to the south, and Eagleson Road to the west. This area was part of the City of Nepean, but was transferred to the new City of Kanata when it was incorporated in 1978. Still under development, there are several residential projects underway in the core and to the south end of Bridlewood. Parts of southern Bridlewood may also be referred to as Emerald Meadows or Monahan Landing.

== Politics ==
Until 2015, Kanata was in the federal and provincial riding of Carleton—Mississippi Mills. Kanata was the largest centre in the riding, with more than half the population being in Kanata. Both federally and provincially, the riding had tilted strongly conservative, with greater Liberal support in Kanata itself being swamped by more conservative voters in the rest of the riding. Norm Sterling represented the area for decades in the Ontario legislature for the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario until he lost the nomination to Jack MacLaren in 2011. Federally, the area went Liberal for most of the 1990s, but in 2000, the riding, then known as Lanark—Carleton, was one of only two in Ontario to elect a Canadian Alliance MP. It was easily won by Conservative Gordon O&#x27;Connor in 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2011. O&#x27;Connor served as a cabinet minister under Stephen Harper from 2006 to 2013.

In 2015, Liberal candidate and Canadian Forces veteran Karen McCrimmon won the newly created riding of Kanata—Carleton, as the new riding had largely become devoid of more conservative rural areas due to population growth.

On the municipal level, the area has been more competitive. From 1994 to 2000, the area was represented on regional council by Kanata native Alex Munter, then a member of the New Democratic Party. In 2000, Munter was elected as the representative to the new Ottawa City Council. Munter retired in 2003 and was replaced by another progressive, Peggy Feltmate. Redistricting prior to the 2006 Ottawa election has seen Kanata divided into two wards, Kanata North and Kanata South. On November 13, 2006, Munter lost to Larry O&#x27;Brien in his bid to be mayor of Ottawa, though he carried Kanata. Feltmate won in the ward of Kanata South, and Marianne Wilkinson, seen as one of the more right-wing, developer-friendly members of council, was elected Councillor of Kanata North. Feltmate retired in 2010 and the Kanata South seat was won by Allan Hubley.

=== Mayors ===
#Marianne Wilkinson (1978–1985)
#Des Adam (1985–1991)
#Merle Nicholds (1991–2000)

== Media ==
Kanata&#x27;s community newspaper is &quot;The Kanata Community Voice&quot;, distributed every second week to all homes, apartments and businesses in the area. This newspaper was started in March 2018.

The &quot;Kanata Kourier-Standard&quot; newspaper, Kanata&#x27;s former community newspaper, was the result of a merger in 1989 between two longtime community newspapers: the &quot;Kanata Kourier,&quot; launched in 1983 by Alex Munter; and the &quot;Kanata Standard,&quot; launched in 1965 by Kanata&#x27;s community association. The paper was sold in November 27, 2017 by Torstar Metroland to Postmedia, who closed the publication January 2018.

<text>Red Flag Linux () is a Linux distribution developed by Red Flag Software. , the executive president of Red Flag Software is Jia Dong ().

Beside specialised solutions, Red Flag Linux had the following products:
* Red Flag Asianux Server 8.0
* Red Flag HA Cluster 7.0
* Red Flag Desktop 10 ()
* Red Flag Desktop 11 ()

The internal structure of Red Flag Linux is very similar to Red Hat Linux, using a similar installer.

==History==
Red Flag Linux first appeared in August 1999, when it was created by the Institute of Software Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Financial help came from government-owned Shanghai NewMargin Venture Capital. In March 2001, Bloomberg News reported that CCIDNET Investment, a venture capital arm of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, had become Red Flag&#x27;s second largest shareholder.

During a brief standoff with Microsoft in January 2000, in a year-long series of increasing tensions believed to have been tied to Microsoft&#x27;s perceived mismanagement of its Microsoft Venus venture, Chinese government ministries were ordered to uninstall Windows 2000 from their computers in favor of Red Flag Linux.

In January 2006, Red Flag Linux joined the Open Source Development Labs.

An Equation Group leak from 2017 included tools that targeted Red Flag Linux.

===2014 Closure/Restructuring===
On 10 February 2014, Red Flag Software terminated all employment contracts and closed down. The direct cause of the closure was cited as being the failure of the Chinese Academy of Sciences&#x27; Software Research Institute to pay a 40 million yuan subsidy. The institute cited Red Flag&#x27;s failure to complete a specific project, and general mismanagement, as reasons for not paying the subsidy.

According to a research manager with IDC in Beijing, its downfall resulted from a lack of brand awareness and sustained investments, coupled with the rise of rivals.

==Nanchang Internet cafes==
As of 3 December 2008, it has been reported that Internet cafes in Nanchang, since November 2008, have been required to install the Red Flag Linux as a replacement for pirated versions of the popular Microsoft Windows operating system, or switch to legitimate copies of Microsoft Windows. Radio Free Asia (which is funded by the U.S. government) claimed that Chinese internet cafes were being required to switch to Red Flag Linux even if they were using genuine copies of the Windows OS. This system is provided with a non-expiring support contract at the cost of 5000 yuan (~ US$850, February 2014) for all machines in the cafe.

An official spokesperson for Red Flag Linux clarified by stating that the announcement were targeted to the server-side and not the gaming-intensive (and therefore Windows demanding) client-side computers, and that in the original announcement, Microsoft Windows and Red Flag Linux were simply recommended platforms as they have been tested by the Bureau of Culture.

<text>The Canny edge detector is an edge detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images. It was developed by John F. Canny in 1986. Canny also produced a &quot;computational theory of edge detection&quot; explaining why the technique works.

== Development ==
Canny edge detection is a technique to extract useful structural information from different vision objects and dramatically reduce the amount of data to be processed. It has been widely applied in various computer vision systems. Canny has found that the requirements for the application of edge detection on diverse vision systems are relatively similar. Thus, an edge detection solution to address these requirements can be implemented in a wide range of situations. 
The general criteria for edge detection include:
# Detection of edge with low error rate, which means that the detection should accurately catch as many edges shown in the image as possible
# The edge point detected from the operator should accurately localize on the center of the edge. 
# A given edge in the image should only be marked once, and where possible, image noise should not create false edges.

To satisfy these requirements Canny used the calculus of variations – a technique which finds the function which optimizes a given functional. The optimal function in Canny&#x27;s detector is described by the sum of four exponential terms, but it can be approximated by the first derivative of a Gaussian.

Among the edge detection methods developed so far, Canny edge detection algorithm is one of the most strictly defined methods that provides good and reliable detection. Owing to its optimality to meet with the three criteria for edge detection and the simplicity of process for implementation, it became one of the most popular algorithms for edge detection.

== Process ==
The process of Canny edge detection algorithm can be broken down to five different steps:
# Apply Gaussian filter to smooth the image in order to remove the noise
# Find the intensity gradients of the image
# Apply gradient magnitude thresholding or lower bound cut-off suppression to get rid of spurious response to edge detection
# Apply double threshold to determine potential edges
# Track edge by hysteresis: Finalize the detection of edges by suppressing all the other edges that are weak and not connected to strong edges.

=== Gaussian filter ===
Since all edge detection results are easily affected by the noise in the image, it is essential to filter out the noise to prevent false detection caused by it. To smooth the image, a Gaussian filter kernel is convolved with the image. This step will slightly smooth the image to reduce the effects of obvious noise on the edge detector. The equation for a Gaussian filter kernel of size (2&quot;k&quot;+1)×(2&quot;k&quot;+1) is given by:

formula_1

Here is an example of a 5×5 Gaussian filter, used to create the adjacent image, with formula_2 = 2. (The asterisk denotes a convolution operation.)

:formula_3

It is important to understand that the selection of the size of the Gaussian kernel will affect the performance of the detector. The larger the size is, the lower the detector&#x27;s sensitivity to noise. Additionally, the localization error to detect the edge will slightly increase with the increase of the Gaussian filter kernel size. A 5×5 is a good size for most cases, but this will also vary depending on specific situations.

=== Finding the intensity gradient of the image ===
An edge in an image may point in a variety of directions, so the Canny algorithm uses four filters to detect horizontal, vertical and diagonal edges in the blurred image. The edge detection operator (such as Roberts, Prewitt, or Sobel) returns a value for the first derivative in the horizontal direction (G&quot;x&quot;) and the vertical direction (G&quot;y&quot;). From this the edge gradient and direction can be determined:

:formula_4

:formula_5,

where G can be computed using the hypot function and atan2 is the arctangent function with two arguments.
The edge direction angle is rounded to one of four angles representing vertical, horizontal, and the two diagonals (0°, 45°, 90°, and 135°). An edge direction falling in each color region will be set to a specific angle value, for instance, θ in [0°, 22.5°] or [157.5°, 180°] maps to 0°.

=== Gradient magnitude thresholding or lower bound cut-off suppression ===
Minimum cut-off suppression of gradient magnitudes, or lower bound thresholding, is an edge thinning technique.

Lower bound cut-off suppression is applied to find the locations with the sharpest change of intensity value. The algorithm for each pixel in the gradient image is:
# Compare the edge strength of the current pixel with the edge strength of the pixel in the positive and negative gradient directions. 
# If the edge strength of the current pixel is the largest compared to the other pixels in the mask with the same direction (e.g., a pixel that is pointing in the y-direction will be compared to the pixel above and below it in the vertical axis), the value will be preserved. Otherwise, the value will be suppressed.
In some implementations, the algorithm categorizes the continuous gradient directions into a small set of discrete directions, and then moves a 3x3 filter over the output of the previous step (that is, the edge strength and gradient directions). At every pixel, it suppresses the edge strength of the center pixel (by setting its value to 0) if its magnitude is not greater than the magnitude of the two neighbors in the gradient direction. For example,
* if the rounded gradient angle is 0° (i.e. the edge is in the north–south direction) the point will be considered to be on the edge if its gradient magnitude is greater than the magnitudes at pixels in the east and west directions,
* if the rounded gradient angle is 90° (i.e. the edge is in the east–west direction) the point will be considered to be on the edge if its gradient magnitude is greater than the magnitudes at pixels in the north and south directions,
* if the rounded gradient angle is 135° (i.e. the edge is in the northeast–southwest direction) the point will be considered to be on the edge if its gradient magnitude is greater than the magnitudes at pixels in the north-west and south-east directions,
* if the rounded gradient angle is 45° (i.e. the edge is in the northwest–southeast direction) the point will be considered to be on the edge if its gradient magnitude is greater than the magnitudes at pixels in the north-east and south-west directions.

In more accurate implementations, linear interpolation is used between the two neighbouring pixels that straddle the gradient direction. For example, if the gradient angle is between 89° and 180°, interpolation between gradients at the north and north-east pixels will give one interpolated value, and interpolation between the south and south-west pixels will give the other (using the conventions of the last paragraph). The gradient magnitude at the central pixel must be greater than both of these for it to be marked as an edge.

Note that the sign of the direction is irrelevant, i.e. north–south is the same as south–north and so on.

=== Double threshold ===
After application of non-maximum suppression, the remaining edge pixels provide a more accurate representation of real edges in an image. However, some edge pixels remain that are caused by noise and color variation. To account for these spurious responses, it is essential to filter out edge pixels with a weak gradient value and preserve edge pixels with a high gradient value. This is accomplished by selecting high and low threshold values. If an edge pixel’s gradient value is higher than the high threshold value, it is marked as a strong edge pixel. If an edge pixel’s gradient value is smaller than the high threshold value and larger than the low threshold value, it is marked as a weak edge pixel. If an edge pixel&#x27;s gradient value is smaller than the low threshold value, it will be suppressed. The two threshold values are empirically determined and their definition will depend on the content of a given input image.

=== Edge tracking by hysteresis ===

The strong edge pixels should certainly be involved in the final edge image; they are deemed to come from true edges in the image. However, there will be some debate on the weak edge pixels. We want to determine whether these pixels come from a true edge, or noise/color variations. Weak edge pixels should be dropped from consideration if it is the latter. This algorithm uses the idea that weak edge pixels from true edges will (usually) be connected to a strong edge pixel while noise responses are unconnected. 
To track the edge connection, blob analysis is applied by looking at a weak edge pixel and its 8-connected neighborhood pixels. As long as there is one strong edge pixel that is involved in the blob, that weak edge point can be identified as one that should be preserved. These weak edge pixels become strong edges that can then cause their neighboring weak edge pixels to be preserved.

== Walkthrough of the algorithm ==
This section will show the progression of an image through each of the five steps.

== Improvements ==
While traditional Canny edge detection provides a relatively simple but precise methodology for the edge detection problem, with more demanding requirements on the accuracy and robustness on the detection, the traditional algorithm can no longer handle the challenging edge detection task. The main defects of the traditional algorithm can be summarized as follows:
# A Gaussian filter is applied to smooth out the noise, but it will also smooth the edge, which is considered as the high frequency feature. This will increase the possibility of missing weak edges, and the appearance of isolated edges in the result.
# For the gradient amplitude calculation, the old Canny edge detection algorithm uses the center in a small 2×2 neighborhood window to calculate the finite difference mean value to represent the gradient amplitude. This method is sensitive to noise and can easily detect false edges and lose real edges.
# In the traditional Canny edge detection algorithm, there will be two fixed global threshold values to filter out the false edges. However, as the image gets complex, different local areas will need very different threshold values to accurately find the real edges. In addition, the global threshold values are determined manually through experiments in the traditional method, which leads to a complexity of calculation when a large number of different images need to be dealt with.
# The result of the traditional detection cannot reach a satisfactory high accuracy of a single response for each edge - multi-point responses will appear.
In order to address these defects, an improvement to the canny edge algorithm is presented in the following paragraphs.

=== Replace Gaussian filter ===
As both edge and noise will be identified as a high frequency signal, a simple Gaussian filter will add a smooth effect on both of them. However, in order to reach high accuracy of detection of the real edge, it is expected that a more smooth effect should be applied to noise and a less smooth effect should be added to the edge. Bing Wang and Shaosheng Fan from Changsha University of Science and Technology developed an adaptive filter, where the filter will evaluate discontinuity between greyscale values of each pixel. The higher the discontinuity, the lower the weight value is set for the smooth filter at that point. Contrarily, the lower the discontinuity between the greyscale values, the higher the weight value is set to the filter. The process to implement this adaptive filter can be summarized in five steps:
:1. K = 1, set the iteration n and the coefficient of the amplitude of the edge h.
:2. Calculate the gradient value formula_6 and formula_7
:3. Calculate the weight according to the formulae below:

formula_8

formula_9

:4. The definition of the adaptive filter is:

formula_10

to smooth the image, where

formula_11

:5. When K = n, stop the iteration, otherwise, k = k+1, keep doing the second step

===Improvement on gradient magnitude and direction calculation ===
The gradient magnitude and direction can be calculated with a variety of different edge detection operators, and the choice of operator can influence the quality of results. A very commonly chosen one is the 3x3 Sobel filter. However, other filters may be better, such as a 5x5 Sobel filter, which will reduce noise, or the Scharr filter, which has better rotational symmetry. Other common choices are Prewitt (used by Zhou) and Roberts Cross.

===Robust method to determine the dual-threshold value ===
In order to resolve the challenges where it is hard to determine the dual-threshold value empirically, Otsu&#x27;s method can be used on the non-maximum suppressed gradient magnitude image to generate the high threshold. The low threshold is typically set to 1/2 of the high threshold in this case. Since the gradient magnitude image is continuous-valued without a well-defined maximum, Otsu&#x27;s method has to be adapted to use value/count pairs instead of a complete histogram.

===The thinning of the edge ===
While the traditional Canny edge detection implements a good detection result to meet the first two criteria, it does not meet the single response per edge strictly. A mathematical morphology technique to thin the detected edge is developed by Mallat S and Zhong.

=== Use of curvelets ===

Curvelets have been used in place of the Gaussian filter and gradient estimation to compute a vector field whose directions and magnitudes approximate the direction and strength of edges in the image, to which steps 3 - 5 of the Canny algorithm are then applied. Curvelets decompose signals into separate components of different scales, and dropping the components of finer scales can reduce noise.

== Differential geometric formulation ==
A more refined approach to obtain edges with sub-pixel accuracy is differential edge detection, where the requirement of non-maximum suppression is formulated in terms of second- and third-order derivatives computed from a scale space representation (Lindeberg 1998) – see the article on edge detection for a detailed description.

== Variational formulation of the Haralick–Canny edge detector ==
A variational explanation for the main ingredient of the Canny edge detector, that is, 
finding the zero crossings of the 2nd derivative along the gradient direction, was shown 
to be the result of minimizing a Kronrod–Minkowski functional while maximizing the integral 
over the alignment of the edge with the gradient field (Kimmel and Bruckstein 2003). See the article on
regularized Laplacian zero crossings and other optimal edge integrators for a detailed description.

== Parameters ==
The Canny algorithm contains a number of adjustable parameters, which can affect the computation time and effectiveness of the algorithm.

* The size of the Gaussian filter: the smoothing filter used in the first stage directly affects the results of the Canny algorithm. Smaller filters cause less blurring, and allow detection of small, sharp lines. A larger filter causes more blurring, smearing out the value of a given pixel over a larger area of the image. Larger blurring radii are more useful for detecting larger, smoother edges – for instance, the edge of a rainbow.
* Thresholds: the use of two thresholds with hysteresis allows more flexibility than a single-threshold approach, but general problems of thresholding approaches still apply. A threshold set too high can miss important information. On the other hand, a threshold set too low will falsely identify irrelevant information (such as noise) as important. It is difficult to give a generic threshold that works well on all images. No tried and tested approach to this problem yet exists.

== Conclusion ==
The Canny algorithm is adaptable to various environments. Its parameters allow it to be tailored to recognition of edges of differing characteristics depending on the particular requirements of a given implementation. In Canny&#x27;s original paper, the derivation of the optimal filter led to a Finite Impulse Response filter, which can be slow to compute in the spatial domain if the amount of smoothing required is important (the filter will have a large spatial support in that case). For this reason, it is often suggested to use Rachid Deriche&#x27;s infinite impulse response form of Canny&#x27;s filter (the Canny–Deriche detector), which is recursive, and which can be computed in a short, fixed amount of time for any desired amount of smoothing. The second form is suitable for real time implementations in FPGAs or DSPs, or very fast embedded PCs. In this context, however, the regular recursive implementation of the Canny operator does not give a good approximation of rotational symmetry and therefore gives a bias towards horizontal and vertical edges.

<text>The aureus ( aurei, &#x27;golden&#x27;, used as a noun) was a gold coin of ancient Rome originally valued at 25 pure silver &quot;denarii&quot; (sin. &quot;denarius&quot;). The &quot;aureus&quot; was regularly issued from the 1st century BC to the beginning of the 4th century AD, when it was replaced by the &quot;solidus&quot;. The &quot;aureus&quot; was about the same size as the &quot;denarius&quot;, but heavier (since gold has a higher density than silver).

Before the time of Julius Caesar the &quot;aureus&quot; was struck infrequently. Caesar struck the coin more often, and standardized the weight at formula_1 of a Roman pound (about 8 grams). Augustus () tariffed the value of the &quot;sestertius&quot; as formula_2 of an &quot;aureus&quot;.

The mass of the &quot;aureus&quot; was decreased to formula_3 of a Roman pound (7.3 g) during the reign of Nero (r. 54–68). At about the same time the purity of the silver coinage was also slightly decreased.
After the reign of Marcus Aurelius (r. 161–180) the production of &quot;aurei&quot; decreased, and the weight fell to formula_4 of a Roman pound (6.5 g) by the time of Caracalla (r. 211–217). During the 3rd century, gold pieces were introduced in a variety of fractions and multiples, making it hard to determine the intended denomination of a gold coin.
During Gallienus’s reign, the purity was briefly reduced to 94%, and a small amount of coins were minted with as low as 80% purity. This was reset back to 99% by the next emperor.

The &quot;solidus&quot; was first introduced by Diocletian (r. 284–305) around 301 AD, struck at 60 to the Roman pound of pure gold (and thus weighing about 5.45 g each) and with an initial value equal to 1,000 &quot;denarii&quot;.
However, Diocletian&#x27;s &quot;solidus&quot; was struck only in small quantities, and thus had only minimal economic effect, although its stable weight brought an end to the instability that had existed for a while. Since only one document of Diocletian&#x27;s time uses this word to describe the coin, numismatists usually reserve the name &quot;solidus&quot; for the coin that was introduced later by Constantine the Great.

When the &quot;solidus&quot; was reintroduced by Constantine I (r. 306–337) in 312 AD, permanently replacing the &quot;aureus&quot; as the gold coin of the Roman Empire, it was struck at a rate of 72 to a Roman pound of pure gold, each coin weighing twenty-four Greco-Roman carats, or about 4.5 grams of gold per coin. By this time, the &quot;solidus&quot; was worth 275,000 of the increasingly debased &quot;denarii&quot;.

However, regardless of the size or weight of the &quot;aureus&quot;, the coin&#x27;s purity was little affected. Analysis of the Roman &quot;aureus&quot; shows the purity level usually to have been near to 24 carat gold, so in excess of 99% pure.

Due to runaway inflation caused by the Roman government&#x27;s issuing base-metal coinage but refusing to accept anything other than silver or gold for tax payments, the value of the gold &quot;aureus&quot; in relation to the &quot;denarius&quot; grew drastically. Inflation was also affected by the systematic debasement of the silver &quot;denarius&quot;, which by the mid-3rd century had practically no silver left in it.

In 301, one gold &quot;aureus&quot; was worth 833⅓ denarii; by 324, the same &quot;aureus&quot; was worth 4,350 &quot;denarii&quot;. In 337, after Constantine converted to the &quot;solidus&quot;, one &quot;solidus&quot; was worth 275,000 &quot;denarii&quot; and finally, by 356, one &quot;solidus&quot; was worth 4,600,000 &quot;denarii&quot;.

Today, the &quot;aureus&quot; is highly sought after by collectors because of its purity and value, as well as its historical interest. An &quot;aureus&quot; is usually much more expensive than a &quot;denarius&quot; issued by the same emperor. For instance, in one auction, an &quot;aureus&quot; of Trajan (r. 98–117) sold for $15,000, and a silver coin of the same emperor sold for $100. The most expensive &quot;aureus&quot; ever sold was one issued in 42 BC by Marcus Junius Brutus, the assassin of Gaius Julius Caesar, which had a price realized of $3.5 million in November 2020. (There is an example of this coin on permanent display at the British Museum in London.) An &quot;aureus&quot;, issued by the emperor Alexander Severus (r. 222–235), has a picture of the Colosseum on the reverse, and had a price realized of $920,000 in 2008. An &quot;aureus&quot; with the face of Allectus was auctioned off in the United Kingdom for £552,000 in June 2019.

<text>Rory O&#x27;Hanlon (born 7 February 1934) is an Irish former Fianna Fáil politician who served as Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann from 2002 to 2007, Leas-Cheann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann from 1997 to 2002, Minister for the Environment from 1991 to 1992, Minister for Health from 1987 to 1991 and Minister of State for Social Welfare Claims in 1982. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Cavan–Monaghan constituency from 1977 to 2011.

==Early life==
Born in Dublin in 1934, O&#x27;Hanlon was brought up in a family that had a strong association with the republican tradition. His father, Michael, who studied medicine was a member of the Fourth Northern Division of the Irish Republican Army during the War of Independence and took the Republican side during the Irish Civil War. As is made clear during a personal interview with Tim Pat Coogan for his biography of Michael Collins, O&#x27;Hanlon confirmed his father&#x27;s military service on Bloody Sunday in Dublin where he assisted members of Michael Collins&#x27; Squad in the killing of known British Agents in the Cairo Gang, who were placing a stranglehold on Collins&#x27; Intelligence War. His father was a close friend of Frank Aiken and was imprisoned in the Old Gaol in Dundalk from where members of the Fourth Northern Division escaped during the famous Hole-In-The-Wall breakout.

O&#x27;Hanlon was educated at Mullaghbawn National School, before later attending St. Mary&#x27;s College, Dundalk and Blackrock College in Dublin. He subsequently studied medicine at University College Dublin and qualified as a doctor. In 1965, he was appointed to Carrickmacross as the local general practitioner and was the medical representative on the North Eastern Health Board from its inception in 1970 until 1987.

==Political career==
===Beginnings===
O&#x27;Hanlon entered his first electoral contest when he was the Fianna Fáil candidate in the 1973 Monaghan by-election caused by the election of Erskine Childers to the Presidency. He was unsuccessful on this occasion but was eventually elected at the 1977 general election for the Cavan–Monaghan constituency. O&#x27;Hanlon was one of a handful of new Fianna Fáil deputies who were elected in that landslide victory for the party and, as a new TD, he remained on the backbenches. Two years later he became a member of Monaghan County Council, serving on that authority until 1987.

In 1979, Jack Lynch suddenly resigned as Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil. The subsequent leadership election resulted in a straight contest between Charles Haughey and George Colley. The latter had the backing of the majority of the existing cabinet, however, a backbench revolt saw Haughey become Taoiseach. O&#x27;Hanlon had supported Colley and was thus overlooked for appointment to the new ministerial and junior ministerial positions. Despite this, he did become a member of the powerful Public Accounts Committee in the Oireachtas.

When Fianna Fáil returned to power after a short-lived Fine Gael-Labour Party government in 1982, O&#x27;Hanlon was once again overlooked for ministerial promotion. An extensive cabinet reshuffle towards the end of the year saw O&#x27;Hanlon become Minister of State for Social Welfare Payments. His tenure was short-lived as the government fell a few weeks later and Fianna Fáil were out of power.

===Government minister===
In early 1983, Charles Haughey announced a new front bench and O&#x27;Hanlon was promoted to the position of spokesperson on Health and Social Welfare.

Following the 1987 general election, Fianna Fáil were back in power, albeit with a minority government, and O&#x27;Hanlon became Minister for Health. Immediately after taking office, he was confronted with several controversial issues, including the resolution of a radiographers&#x27; dispute and the formation of an HIV/AIDS awareness campaign. While Fianna Fáil campaigned on a platform of not introducing any public spending cuts, the party committed a complete u-turn once in government. The savage cuts about healthcare earned O&#x27;Hanlon the nickname &quot;Dr. Death&quot;. Despite earning this reputation, O&#x27;Hanlon also introduced a law to curb smoking in public places.

O&#x27;Hanlon&#x27;s handling of the Department of Health meant that he was one of the names tipped for promotion as a result of Ray MacSharry&#x27;s departure as Minister for Finance. In the end, he was retained as Minister for Health and was disappointed not to be given a new portfolio following the 1989 general election.

In 1991, O&#x27;Hanlon became Minister for the Environment. This was following Albert Reynolds&#x27; failed leadership challenge against Charles Haughey. He succeeded Pádraig Flynn who had been part of the challenge to Haughey.

When Reynolds eventually came to power in 1992, O&#x27;Hanlon was one of several high-profile members of the cabinet who lost their ministerial positions.

===Post-cabinet career===
In 1995, O&#x27;Hanlon became chair of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party before being elected Leas-Cheann Comhairle (deputy chair) of Dáil Éireann in 1997. Following the 2002 general election, O&#x27;Hanlon became Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann. In this position, he was required to remain neutral and, as such, he was no longer classed as a representative of any political party. He was an active chair of the Dáil; however, on occasion, he was criticised, most notably by Labour&#x27;s Pat Rabbitte, for allegedly stifling debate and being overly protective of the government. Following the 2007 general election, he was succeeded as Ceann Comhairle by John O&#x27;Donoghue. He was the vice-chair of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs.

He retired from politics at the 2011 general election.

==Personal life==
Two of O&#x27;Hanlon&#x27;s children have served as local politicians in Cavan–Monaghan, a son Shane is a former member of Monaghan County Council and a daughter Fiona O&#x27;Hea served one term on Cootehill Town Council. He is also the father of actor and comedian Ardal O&#x27;Hanlon. The Sinn Féin TD Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin is also a relation of O&#x27;Hanlon, as was the late Paddy O&#x27;Hanlon a founder-member of the SDLP. Ciarán Mullooly of Independent Ireland is a distant relative through family lineage in Australia and Louth.

<text>James Joseph McDaid (born 3 October 1949) is an Irish former Fianna Fáil politician who served as Minister of State for Transport from 2002 to 2004 and Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation from 1997 to 2004. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Donegal North-East constituency from 1989 to 2010.

McDaid has had a concurrent career as a medical doctor and continues to work as a general practitioner in Letterkenny.

==Early life==
McDaid was born in Termon, County Donegal in 1949. He was educated in St Eunan&#x27;s College in Letterkenny between 1962 and 1967. He went on to attend University College Galway (UCG), and was conferred with a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery in 1974. While at University College Galway, he played on the university soccer team that won three national titles, with McDaid captaining the side on two of those occasions. He was Clubman of the Year Award winner in 1972–73.

Between 1974 and 1979, McDaid worked at Letterkenny General Hospital, and in 1979 he went into partnership as a general practitioner in Letterkenny. He served as a medical officer to the Donegal county Gaelic football team.

==Political career==
McDaid was elected to Dáil Éireann on his first attempt at the 1989 general election. He ousted sitting Fianna Fáil TD Hugh Conaghan, and, according to &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, was selected by the party to run against their own man due to Conaghan&#x27;s opposition to the then Leader of Fianna Fáil Charles Haughey. He was re-elected at each subsequent general election until his resignation from the Dáil in 2010. In 1991, he was nominated by Taoiseach Charles Haughey to the position of Minister for Defence. On the morning the Dáil was due to debate his appointment, a photograph emerged taken outside Dublin&#x27;s Four Courts on the day a judge ruled that the Maze Prison escaper, James Pius Clarke, should not be extradited to the United Kingdom. McDaid was seen in the background, smiling broadly. While McDaid stated that his presence at the hearing was due to personal connections – Clarke&#x27;s mother was a constituent and a patient in his general practice in Letterkenny – the opposition Fine Gael party objected to his appointment and ministers from Fianna Fáil&#x27;s coalition partners, the Progressive Democrats, indicated their unwillingness to remain in office should McDaid be appointed. McDaid withdrew his name from consideration. Following Bertie Ahern&#x27;s election as leader of Fianna Fáil in 1994, McDaid was appointed to the front bench as spokesperson on Equality and Law Reform.

McDaid joined the government in 1997, when he was appointed Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. During his tenure he earned the nickname the &quot;Minister for Fun&quot;, however, he presided over much more weighty issues such as investigations into controversial events such as drugs allegations in sport and sex abuse by swimming coaches. Following the 2002 general election, McDaid failed to retain his Cabinet post, but he did become a Minister of State. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the North-West constituency at the 2004 European Parliament election and was later sacked from his position as Minister of State and returned to the backbenches once again.

In April 2006, McDaid announced that he would be retiring from public life in favour of returning to his medical practice and would not be standing in the next general election and that politics &quot;no longer held any challenge for him&quot;. However, on 27 July 2006, following the announcement that Independent Fianna Fáil TD Niall Blaney had joined the Fianna Fáil party, McDaid reversed this decision, and announced that he would be seeking nomination as a candidate to contest the 2007 general election. Following the absorption of Independent Fianna Fáil and its sole TD, Niall Blaney into Fianna Fáil, there were then three outgoing Fianna Fáil TDs in this very competitive three-seat constituency. Under the electoral system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote, it was considered virtually impossible for all three to be elected. Fianna Fáil&#x27;s Cecilia Keaveney lost her seat to the Fine Gael candidate Joe McHugh, with McDaid and Blaney being the two successful Fianna Fáil candidates.

McDaid told the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; on 1 June 2007 that he had received no help from Fianna Fáil headquarters during the general election campaign and that the party had treated him as a virtual independent. He warned that, consequently, the party should not take his support in the 30th Dáil for granted. This threat was followed through in November 2008 when he abstained from a vote on the Cervical cancer vaccination programme, resulting in his expulsion from the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party.

In April 2010, he said he would not be voluntarily giving up his ministerial pension of €22,487, despite most other TDs and Senators having done so. He said he would not do so &quot;unless it is the express wish of Dáil Éireann&quot;. The next month it was reported that he missed more than four out of every five Dáil votes in 2009 – by far the worst record of any TD.

McDaid resigned from his Dáil seat on 2 November 2010. In his resignation letter, he called for a general election before December 2010 and also accused the Government of taking political soft options and not tackling the real issues.

==Personal life==
McDaid&#x27;s private life has long been a source of interest in the Irish media. The breakdown of his marriage, and the subsequent publication of a book by his ex-wife, revealed the details of their troubled marriage and separation. He is divorced from his first wife Marguerite, with whom he had three sons and a daughter.

In April 2005, McDaid was arrested when found driving drunk in the wrong direction on a dual carriageway outside Dublin. Oncoming vehicles were forced to swerve to avoid his car, which was eventually forced to stop when a haulier blocked his path. Tests showed a blood alcohol level of 267 mg, more than three times over the legal limit of 80 mg. He was subsequently convicted of dangerous driving while intoxicated and drunken driving, banned from driving for 2 years and fined €750. However, he was returned his licence after only a year. The case attracted media attention and McDaid was described as &quot;a disgrace&quot; and &quot;an idiot&quot;. He acknowledged that these descriptions were accurate, and stated that he was genuinely sorry for his actions.

Three years earlier, as junior Transport Minister in November 2002, he had spearheaded the Government&#x27;s anti-drink driving campaign, warning that &quot;some drivers still choose to ignore our drink driving laws, and as a result innocent lives are destroyed&quot;.

He lives with his second wife, Siobhán and the couple&#x27;s son.

<doc id="476833" wikidata="Q840516" url="?curid=476833" title="The Vampire Chronicles">
<text>The Vampire Chronicles is a series of gothic vampire novels and a media franchise, created by American writer Anne Rice, that revolves around the fictional character Lestat de Lioncourt, a French nobleman turned into a vampire in the 18th century.

Rice said in a 2008 interview that her vampires were a &quot;metaphor for lost souls&quot;. The homoerotic overtones of &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; are also well-documented. As of November 2008, &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; had sold 80 million copies worldwide.

The first novel in the series, &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; (1976), was made into a 1994 film starring Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas, Christian Slater and Kirsten Dunst. &quot;The Queen of the Damned&quot; (1988) was adapted into a 2002 film of the same name, starring Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah and using some material from 1985&#x27;s &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot;. In May 2020, AMC acquired the rights to both &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Lives of the Mayfair Witches&quot; for developing film and television projects. A television series, &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, premiered on AMC on October 2, 2022, starring Jacob Anderson and Sam Reid.

==Books in the series==

Rice considered &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; a conclusion to the series and thought she would never write about Lestat again. In a 2008 interview with &quot;Time&quot;, she called her vampires a &quot;metaphor for lost souls&quot;, and noted that writing about them had been, to her, &quot;a sort of search for God and a kind of grief for a lost faith.&quot; Her 1998 return to the Catholic Church after 38 years of atheism had prompted a change in the direction of her writing that resulted in her 2005 novel &quot;Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt&quot; and its 2008 sequel &quot;Christ the Lord: The Road to Cana&quot;.

However, in the same interview, Rice said: &quot;I have one more book that I would really like to write; and the book will have a definite Christian framework and it will concern the vampire Lestat; and it will be a story I think I need to tell. But it will have to be in a redemptive framework. It will have to be where Lestat is really wrestling with the existence of God in a very personal way.&quot; That same year she produced a YouTube video in which she told her readers that she had dismissed any intentions of writing any more books in &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot;, calling the series &quot;closed&quot;. Later, during a 2012 Q&amp;A in Toronto, Canada, an audience member asked Rice if she would bring any of her old characters back, to which she replied: &quot;I&#x27;m not ruling it out. I think it&#x27;s very possible. I mean, I feel completely open with a new confidence in myself about it. I want to hear what Lestat has to say.&quot; On March 10, 2014, Rice announced a new installment of &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; titled &quot;Prince Lestat&quot;, calling it the first of a new series. &quot;Prince Lestat&quot; was released on October 28, 2014. A sequel, &quot;Prince Lestat and the Realms of Atlantis&quot;, was released on November 29, 2016, followed by &quot;Blood Communion: A Tale of Prince Lestat&quot; on October 2, 2018.

* &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; (2002)
* &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; (2003)

==Plot summary==
=== &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; (1976) ===
Louis de Pointe du Lac tells a young reporter the story of how he had been made a vampire in 18th-century New Orleans by Lestat de Lioncourt. In creating and sheltering the child vampire Claudia, Lestat and Louis had unknowingly set tragedy in motion.

=== &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; (1985) ===
This book chronicles Lestat&#x27;s own origins, as he resurfaces in the modern world and attempts to find meaning by exposing himself to humanity in the guise of a rock star. This attracts the attention of the ancient vampire Marius de Romanus, and culminates in the accidental awakening of Akasha, the ancient Egyptian queen and first vampire, who has been immobile for millennia and safeguarded by Marius.

=== &quot;The Queen of the Damned&quot; (1988) ===
Lestat has awakened Akasha, the first of all vampires, who has in her thousands of years of immobility, contrived an idealized way to achieve world peace, by killing almost all males and destroying all other vampires. She is herself destroyed by the vampire witch Mekare, who has awakened and returned after 6,000 years to fulfill a promise to destroy Akasha at the moment she poses the greatest threat.

=== &quot;The Tale of the Body Thief&quot; (1992) ===
The novel finds Lestat haunted by his past and tiring of immortality. A thief switches bodies with him and runs off, and Lestat enlists David Talbot, leader of the Talamasca and one of his only remaining friends, to help him retrieve it.

=== &quot;Memnoch the Devil&quot; (1995) ===
Lestat meets the Devil, who calls himself Memnoch. He takes Lestat on a whirlwind tour of Heaven and Hell, and retells the entirety of history from his own point of view in an effort to convince Lestat to join him as God&#x27;s adversary. In his journey, Memnoch claims he is not evil, but merely working for God by ushering lost souls into Heaven. Lestat is left in confusion, unable to decide whether or not to cast his lot with the Devil.

=== Subsequent novels ===
Rice&#x27;s &quot;New Tales of the Vampires&quot;—&quot;Pandora&quot; (1998) and &quot;Vittorio the Vampire&quot; (1999)—do not feature Lestat at all, instead telling the stories of the eponymous peripheral vampires, the Patrician Pandora from Rome in the 1st century B.C. and the 15th-century Italian nobleman Vittorio.

Armand tells his own life story in 1998&#x27;s &quot;The Vampire Armand&quot;, and Rice&#x27;s &quot;Mayfair Witches&quot; series crosses over with &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; in &quot;Merrick&quot; (2000) as Louis and David seek Merrick Mayfair&#x27;s help in resurrecting Claudia&#x27;s spirit. The origins of Marius are explored in 2001&#x27;s &quot;Blood and Gold&quot;, and &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; (2002) tells the story of young Tarquin Blackwood as he enlists Lestat and Merrick to help him banish a spirit named Goblin. 2003&#x27;s &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; intertwines the vampire, Blackwood and Mayfair storylines, and was intended by Rice to conclude the series.

&quot;Prince Lestat&quot; (2014) rejoins the remaining vampires a decade later as Lestat faces pressure to lead them. &quot;Prince Lestat and the Realms of Atlantis&quot; (2016) and &quot;Blood Communion&quot; (2018) continued this new narrative thread.

==Mythology==

In her review of &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; (1985) &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Michiko Kakutani noted, &quot;We learn lots of &#x27;facts&#x27; about vampires and vampire culture. We learn that they cry tears of blood, that they&#x27;re capable of reading other people&#x27;s minds, that they can be destroyed by fire and sunlight. We learn that &#x27;no vampire may ever destroy another vampire, except that the coven master has the power of life and death over all of his flock&#x27;; and we learn that &#x27;no vampire shall ever reveal his true nature to a mortal and allow that mortal to live&#x27;.&quot; Through &quot;The Tale of The Body Thief&quot; and &quot;Memnoch The Devil&quot;, the cosmology of the series expands into exploration of broader supernatural themes and realms, particularly of Heaven and Hell, and also into exploration of apex supernatural entities like angels, the devil, and God Himself. Memnoch also acknowledges that many other types of earthbound supernatural creatures exist aside from the vampires, which leaves open connections to Rice&#x27;s Taltos and werewolf stories.

=== Backstory ===

Rice chronicles the origins of her vampires in &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; and &quot;The Queen of the Damned&quot;.

The first vampires appeared in Ancient Egypt, their origin connected to spirits which existed before Earth. Mekare and Maharet, twin witches living on Mount Carmel, were able to speak to the mischievous and bloodthirsty shade Amel. Amel grew to love Mekare, becoming her familiar. In time, soldiers sent by Akasha, Queen of Egypt, burned their village and captured the two witches. Coveting their knowledge and power, the Queen imprisoned and tortured the witches for some time; this infuriated the spirit of Amel, who began to haunt Akasha&#x27;s villages and her nobles.

In time, as Akasha&#x27;s own treacherous noblemen conspired against her and instigated both her murder and that of her husband, King Enkil, the spirit of Amel infused into her body as she lay dying. The shade&#x27;s power and bloodlust roused her from death – reborn as the first immortal. After siring her spouse as well, Akasha and Enkil became known as the Divine Parents. To punish the twins for standing against her, the Queen had Maharet&#x27;s eyes torn out and Mekare&#x27;s tongue severed. Before they were to be executed, the steward Khayman sired them both out of pity.

Together they formed the First Brood and stood against the Divine Parents and their followers, the Queen&#x27;s Blood. Overwhelmed and captured, the twins were separated and sent into exile; Maharet to familiar lands in the Red Sea, and Mekare to uncharted waters out towards the west. After two millennia, the Queen and King went mute and catatonic. They were maintained like statues by elders and priests under the impression that if Akasha – the host of Amel, the Sacred Core – died, all vampires would die with her. As the Common Era arrived, most undead forgot.

As years passed, the story of the Divine Parents were maintained by a few elders who barely believed it themselves. Despite this, many of the self-made blood gods – vampires from Akasha&#x27;s earlier progeny – remained entombed in hollowed-out trees or brick cells where they starved. Early in the Common Era, the elder who was entrusted to keep the Parents abandoned Akasha and Enkil in the desert to wait for the sun to rise and consume them. While they remained unharmed, young vampires everywhere were destroyed by fire and even mighty elders were badly burned.

Following this, the fledgling Marius – a gifted Roman scholar – went to Egypt and retrieved the Divine Parents, making them his sacred responsibility as the new keeper. Over the course of nearly two millennia, they came to be known in legends as Marius and Those Who Must Be Kept. At some point in time, Maharet returned to her village on Mount Carmel in the guise of a distant family member. She returned periodically over the course of many centuries to keep a record of her descendants, all the way down to Jesse Reeves – one of the last of the Great Family.

=== Characteristics ===
Rice&#x27;s vampires differ in many ways from their traditional counterparts such as Dracula. They are unaffected by crucifixes, garlic, a stake through the heart, or holy water. Ancient immortals are almost completely unaffected by the sun. The key trait of Rice&#x27;s vampires is that they are unusually emotional and sensual, prone to aesthetic thinking. This lends well to artistic pursuits such as painting, writing, and singing; all of which are refined by their eidetic memory and heightened beauty.

Beyond their refined physical features, Rice&#x27;s vampires are unique in that their appearance is more statue-like than human. Their pupils are luminous while in the dark and their nails appear more like glass. Being undead, their skin is likewise pallid as well as unusually smooth. Additionally, upon being sired, the vampire&#x27;s body is essentially frozen in the state in which it died. Their hair and nails cease to grow; if they are cut, they will quickly grow back. The undead also possess no bodily fluids other than blood, as they are purged following death.

While virtually all other internal bodily functions expire, Rice&#x27;s vampires still possess a noticeable heartbeat – albeit considerably slower than that of a living heart. This ensures normal blood circulation and also synchronizes with that of their fledglings while turning them. When vampires enter a state of hibernation, their hearts cease to beat and they enter into a desiccated state in which their bodies become skeletal and dry from lack of blood flow. Blood starvation may also trigger this. Removing their heart from their bodies will also kill them.

Despite these differences, Rice&#x27;s undead do share some similarities with mainstream vampire fiction. They are supernaturally strong and can move faster than the eye can see. Their senses are heightened and they will heal from any injury short of beheading and even reattach limbs. The act of feeding is highly sexualized in Rice&#x27;s novels. Vampires both crave and need blood to sustain their unlife. While they can feed on animals, human blood is more nourishing. As they age, they&#x27;re able to resist the urge more to the point where elders feed only for pleasure.

As with most vampire fiction, all of the undead were originally human. To sire a fledgling, a maker must feed upon a victim to the point of death. The attacker must then offer their own blood for the mortal to drink. After their body expires, they resurrect as a newborn immortal. Fledglings retain all the memories and mannerisms they had in life, however these usually fade or change over time as they acclimate to their new existence. Many young vampires experience existential crises or crippling depression as they learn to cope with their isolated nature.

==== Vampire Gifts ====
Within Rice&#x27;s mythology, vampires possess certain paranormal abilities known as gifts. For younger undead, these gifts usually manifest in subtle ways. For older immortals – particularly ancient ones – these manifest as potent displays of both magic and their own inhuman natures. As vampires age, they become both stronger as well as more unnatural and statuesque in their appearance. Their demeanor usually becomes more tempered and calculating, even moreso as their more potent gifts manifest; which further distances them from their former human sentiments.

*Cloud Gift – This gift is proprietary to older undead. This power encompasses both levitation and eventually flight; allowing the immortal to ride wind currents high into the air or across long distances as well as adhere to sheer surfaces. Some prefer not to use it due to its inhuman nature. The precise time at which a vampire may develop this potent gift is uncertain. Some elders aren&#x27;t aware that they even possess it, while all ancient ones are certain to use it at some point. Some speculate that the desire to fly is a contributing factor to manifesting this power.
*Fire Gift – This is the ability to set objects alight through sheer pyrokinetic will, so long as they maintain eye contact to direct their focus. This is another gift exclusive to older vampires and ancients, allowing them to set even other immortals aflame by igniting their flammable blood. Like other such powers, it&#x27;s uncertain when exactly this gift manifests in a vampire. Fledglings sired by considerably older immortals may begin developing this ability from a very young age due to the raw potency of their maker&#x27;s blood. Feeding on old undead may also trigger it.
*Mind Gift – This gift is present even in fledglings and encompasses the powers of both telepathy and telekinesis. A vampire may read the thoughts of others even while asleep, as well as project their own thoughts into others or exert their will onto physical objects such as doors or engines. As they become elders, vampires slowly learn how to mentally strip information from humans against their will and later how to send out a psychokinetic blast that can rupture the brain and blood cells of mortals and undead alike, so long as they maintain visual contact for focus.
*Spell Gift – This gift is active even in fledglings, albeit to a lesser degree as many have yet to learn how to use it properly. Rooted in eye-to-eye contact, this gift is a form of hypnosis which allows the vampire to persuade a mortal of something. Older undead can even beguile younger ones. Although this power cannot compel victims to do something against their will, it does allow a skilled vampire to erase memories as well as fabricate new ones. Due to its cerebral nature, it is ineffective from a distance. Many undead believe this power is rooted in the Mind Gift.

===Society===
The series creates its own terminology: vampires call the transfer of vampirism to a human the &quot;Dark Gift&quot;, and refer to the vampire bestowing it as the &quot;maker&quot; and the new vampire as a &quot;fledgling&quot;. In ancient times vampires formed a religion-like cult, and in the Middle Ages, believing themselves cursed, dwelt in catacombs under cemeteries in covens which emphasized darkness and their own cursed state.

Vampires are largely solitary; Lestat&#x27;s &quot;family&quot; of 80 years is described as unusually long. There is no organized society beyond covens, religious bodies, and small groups from time to time. While a few vampires seem to find a way to cope with immortality, most capitulate to self-destructive anger or depression and do not survive beyond some decades or a few centuries. This is described in the series by the saying that vampires &quot;go into the fire or go into history&quot;—the few that survive far longer become legendary or semi-mythical characters. The most ancient vampires, a thousand or more years old, are known colloquially as &quot;Children of the Millennia&quot;. In his life as a vampire, Lestat spends decades trying to find any vampire who is more than a few hundred years old, as a way to learn where they all came from and what their vampiric status means, a quest that eventually leads him to the 2000-year-old Marius.

==Themes and impact==
In 2008 Rice called her vampires a &quot;metaphor for lost souls&quot;, adding that &quot;they were metaphors for us ... these were wonderful ways of writing about all our dilemmas in life... for me, supernatural characters were the way to talk about life; they were a way to talk about reality, actually.&quot; She also noted that writing about them had been, to her, &quot;a sort of search for God and a kind of grief for a lost faith.&quot;

The homoerotic overtones of &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; are also well-documented. Susan Ferraro of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Gay readers see in the vampires&#x27; lonely, secretive search for others of their kind a metaphor for the homosexual experience.&quot; In 1996, Rice commented:

She said later in 2008:
In his book &quot;Anne Rice and Sexual Politics: The Early Novels&quot;, James R. Keller asserts that the publication and success of Rice&#x27;s &quot;Vampire Chronicles&quot; reinforced the &quot;widely recognized parallel between the queer and the vampire.&quot; He notes that in particular &quot;gay and lesbian readers have been quick to identify with the representation of the vampire, suggesting its experiences parallel those of the sexual outsider.&quot; Richard Dyer discusses the recurring homoerotic motifs of vampire fiction in his article &quot;Children of the Night&quot;, primarily &quot;the necessity of secrecy, the persistence of a forbidden passion, and the fear of discovery.&quot;

==Reception==
As of November 2008, &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; had sold 80 million copies worldwide.

==Adaptations==

===Film===
&quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; was released in November 1994 starring Tom Cruise as Lestat, Brad Pitt as Louis, Kirsten Dunst as Claudia and Antonio Banderas as Armand.

A second film, &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;, which combined plot elements of &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; and &quot;The Queen of the Damned&quot;, was released in 2002 starring Stuart Townsend as Lestat and Aaliyah as Akasha.

In August 2014, Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment acquired the motion picture rights to the entire &quot;Vampire Chronicles&quot; series, with producers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci signed to helm the potential film franchise. The deal also included a screenplay for &quot;The Tale of the Body Thief&quot; (1992) adapted by Christopher Rice, Anne Rice&#x27;s son. In May 2016, writer–director Josh Boone posted a photo on Instagram of the cover a script written by him and Jill Killington. Titled &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, it is based on the novel of the same name and its sequel, &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot;.

===Television===

In November 2016, Rice announced on Facebook that the rights to her novels were reverted to her despite earlier plans for other adaptations. Rice said that she and her son Christopher would be developing and executive producing a potential television series based on the novels. In April 2017, they teamed up with Paramount Television and Anonymous Content to develop a series. As of early 2018, Bryan Fuller was involved with the creation of a potential TV series based on the novels. On July 17, 2018, it was announced that the series was in development at streaming service Hulu and that Fuller had departed the production. As of December 2019, Hulu&#x27;s rights had expired and Rice was shopping a package including all film and TV rights to the series. In May 2020, it was announced that AMC had acquired the rights to &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Lives of the Mayfair Witches&quot; for developing film and television projects. Anne and Christopher Rice would serve as executive producers on any projects developed. In June 2021, it was announced that AMC had given a series order for &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, an eight-episode television adaptation of the novel. The project is executive produced by Rolin Jones and Mark Johnson. The series premiered on AMC on October 2, 2022, starring Jacob Anderson as Louis, and Sam Reid as Lestat. &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; was renewed for an eight-episode second season in September 2022, ahead of its premiere on AMC. In June 2024, the series was renewed for a third season.

&quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; has received critical acclaim, and is the first television series in Rice&#x27;s Immortal Universe, based on the works of Anne Rice, with the second entry being the television adaptation of &quot;Lives of the Mayfair Witches&quot;.

<doc id="476836" wikidata="Q581861" url="?curid=476836" title="Noise reduction">
<text>Noise reduction is the process of removing noise from a signal. Noise reduction techniques exist for audio and images. Noise reduction algorithms may distort the signal to some degree. Noise rejection is the ability of a circuit to isolate an undesired signal component from the desired signal component, as with common-mode rejection ratio.

All signal processing devices, both analog and digital, have traits that make them susceptible to noise. Noise can be random with an even frequency distribution (white noise), or frequency-dependent noise introduced by a device&#x27;s mechanism or signal processing algorithms.

In electronic systems, a major type of noise is &quot;hiss&quot; created by random electron motion due to thermal agitation. These agitated electrons rapidly add and subtract from the output signal and thus create detectable noise.

In the case of photographic film and magnetic tape, noise (both visible and audible) is introduced due to the grain structure of the medium. In photographic film, the size of the grains in the film determines the film&#x27;s sensitivity, more sensitive film having larger-sized grains. In magnetic tape, the larger the grains of the magnetic particles (usually ferric oxide or magnetite), the more prone the medium is to noise. To compensate for this, larger areas of film or magnetic tape may be used to lower the noise to an acceptable level.

== In general ==
Noise reduction algorithms tend to alter signals to a greater or lesser degree. The local signal-and-noise orthogonalization algorithm can be used to avoid changes to the signals.

== In seismic exploration ==
Boosting signals in seismic data is especially crucial for seismic imaging, inversion, and interpretation, thereby greatly improving the success rate in oil &amp; gas exploration. The useful signal that is smeared in the ambient random noise is often neglected and thus may cause fake discontinuity of seismic events and artifacts in the final migrated image. Enhancing the useful signal while preserving edge properties of the seismic profiles by attenuating random noise can help reduce interpretation difficulties and misleading risks for oil and gas detection.

== In audio ==
Tape hiss is a performance-limiting issue in analog tape recording. This is related to the particle size and texture used in the magnetic emulsion that is sprayed on the recording media, and also to the relative tape velocity across the tape heads.

Four types of noise reduction exist: single-ended pre-recording, single-ended hiss reduction, single-ended surface noise reduction, and codec or dual-ended systems. Single-ended pre-recording systems (such as Dolby HX Pro), work to affect the recording medium at the time of recording. Single-ended hiss reduction systems (such as DNL or DNR) work to reduce noise as it occurs, including both before and after the recording process as well as for live broadcast applications. Single-ended surface noise reduction (such as CEDAR and the earlier SAE 5000A, Burwen TNE 7000, and Packburn 101/323/323A/323AA and 325) is applied to the playback of phonograph records to address scratches, pops, and surface non-linearities. Single-ended dynamic range expanders like the Phase Linear Autocorrelator Noise Reduction and Dynamic Range Recovery System (Models 1000 and 4000) can reduce various noise from old recordings. Dual-ended systems (such as Dolby noise-reduction system or dbx) have a pre-emphasis process applied during recording and then a de-emphasis process applied during playback.

Modern digital sound recordings no longer need to worry about tape hiss so analog-style noise reduction systems are not necessary. However, an interesting twist is that dither systems actually add noise to a signal to improve its quality.

=== Compander-based noise reduction systems ===
Dual-ended compander noise reduction systems have a pre-emphasis process applied during recording and then a de-emphasis process applied at playback. Systems include the professional systems Dolby A and Dolby SR by Dolby Laboratories, dbx Professional and dbx Type I by dbx, Donald Aldous&#x27; EMT NoiseBX, , Telefunken&#x27;s and MXR Innovations&#x27; MXR as well as the consumer systems Dolby NR, Dolby B, Dolby C and Dolby S, dbx Type II, Telefunken&#x27;s High Com and Nakamichi&#x27;s High-Com II, Toshiba&#x27;s (Aurex AD-4) , JVC&#x27;s and Super ANRS, Fisher/Sanyo&#x27;s Super D, SNRS, and the Hungarian/East-German Ex-Ko system.

In some compander systems, the compression is applied during professional media production and only the expansion is applied by the listener; for example, systems like dbx disc, High-Com II, CX 20 and UC used for vinyl recordings and Dolby FM, High Com FM and FMX used in FM radio broadcasting.

The first widely used audio noise reduction technique was developed by Ray Dolby in 1966. Intended for professional use, Dolby Type A was an encode/decode system in which the amplitude of frequencies in four bands was increased during recording (encoding), then decreased proportionately during playback (decoding). In particular, when recording quiet parts of an audio signal, the frequencies above 1 kHz would be boosted. This had the effect of increasing the signal-to-noise ratio on tape up to 10 dB depending on the initial signal volume. When it was played back, the decoder reversed the process, in effect reducing the noise level by up to 10 dB.

The Dolby B system (developed in conjunction with Henry Kloss) was a single-band system designed for consumer products. The Dolby B system, while not as effective as Dolby A, had the advantage of remaining listenable on playback systems without a decoder.

The Telefunken High Com integrated circuit &quot;U401BR&quot; could be utilized to work as a mostly Dolby B–compatible compander as well. In various late-generation High Com tape decks the Dolby-B emulating &quot;D NR Expander&quot; functionality worked not only for playback, but, as an undocumented feature, also during recording.

dbx was a competing analog noise reduction system developed by David E. Blackmer, founder of Dbx, Inc. It used a root-mean-squared (RMS) encode/decode algorithm with the noise-prone high frequencies boosted, and the entire signal fed through a 2:1 compander. dbx operated across the entire audible bandwidth and unlike Dolby B was unusable without a decoder. However, it could achieve up to 30 dB of noise reduction.

Since analog video recordings use frequency modulation for the luminance part (composite video signal in direct color systems), which keeps the tape at saturation level, audio-style noise reduction is unnecessary.

=== Dynamic noise limiter and dynamic noise reduction ===
Dynamic noise limiter (DNL) is an audio noise reduction system originally introduced by Philips in 1971 for use on cassette decks. Its circuitry is also based on a single chip.

It was further developed into dynamic noise reduction (DNR) by National Semiconductor to reduce noise levels on long-distance telephony. First sold in 1981, DNR is frequently confused with the far more common Dolby noise-reduction system.

Unlike Dolby and dbx Type I and Type II noise reduction systems, DNL and DNR are playback-only signal processing systems that do not require the source material to first be encoded. They can be used to remove background noise from any audio signal, including magnetic tape recordings and FM radio broadcasts, reducing noise by as much as 10 dB. They can also be used in conjunction with other noise reduction systems, provided that they are used prior to applying DNR to prevent DNR from causing the other noise reduction system to mistrack.

One of DNR&#x27;s first widespread applications was in the GM Delco car stereo systems in US GM cars introduced in 1984. It was also used in factory car stereos in Jeep vehicles in the 1980s, such as the Cherokee XJ. Today, DNR, DNL, and similar systems are most commonly encountered as a noise reduction system in microphone systems.

=== Other approaches ===
A second class of algorithms work in the time-frequency domain using some linear or nonlinear filters that have local characteristics and are often called &quot;time-frequency filters&quot;. Noise can therefore be also removed by use of spectral editing tools, which work in this time-frequency domain, allowing local modifications without affecting nearby signal energy. This can be done manually much like in a paint program drawing pictures. Another way is to define a dynamic threshold for filtering noise, that is derived from the local signal, again with respect to a local time-frequency region. Everything below the threshold will be filtered, everything above the threshold, like partials of a voice or &quot;wanted noise&quot;, will be untouched. The region is typically defined by the location of the signal&#x27;s instantaneous frequency, as most of the signal energy to be preserved is concentrated about it.

Yet another approach is the automatic noise limiter and noise blanker commonly found on HAM radio transceivers, CB radio transceivers, etc. Both of the aforementioned filters can be used separately, or in conjunction with each other at the same time, depending on the transceiver itself.

=== Software programs ===
Most digital audio workstations (DAWs) and audio editing software have one or more noise reduction functions.

== In images ==
Images taken with digital cameras or conventional film cameras will pick up noise from a variety of sources. Further use of these images will often require that the noise be reduced either for aesthetic purposes, or for practical purposes such as computer vision.

=== Types ===
In salt and pepper noise (sparse light and dark disturbances), also known as impulse noise, pixels in the image are very different in color or intensity from their surrounding pixels; the defining characteristic is that the value of a noisy pixel bears no relation to the color of surrounding pixels. When viewed, the image contains dark and white dots, hence the term salt and pepper noise. Generally, this type of noise will only affect a small number of image pixels. Typical sources include flecks of dust inside the camera and overheated or faulty CCD elements.

In Gaussian noise, each pixel in the image will be changed from its original value by a (usually) small amount. A histogram, a plot of the amount of distortion of a pixel value against the frequency with which it occurs, shows a normal distribution of noise. While other distributions are possible, the Gaussian (normal) distribution is usually a good model, due to the central limit theorem that says that the sum of different noises tends to approach a Gaussian distribution.

In either case, the noise at different pixels can be either correlated or uncorrelated; in many cases, noise values at different pixels are modeled as being independent and identically distributed, and hence uncorrelated.

=== Removal ===

==== Tradeoffs ====
There are many noise reduction algorithms in image processing. In selecting a noise reduction algorithm, one must weigh several factors:
* the available computer power and time available: a digital camera must apply noise reduction in a fraction of a second using a tiny onboard CPU, while a desktop computer has much more power and time
* whether sacrificing some real detail is acceptable if it allows more noise to be removed (how aggressively to decide whether variations in the image are noise or not)
* the characteristics of the noise and the detail in the image, to better make those decisions

==== Chroma and luminance noise separation ====
In real-world photographs, the highest spatial-frequency detail consists mostly of variations in brightness (&quot;luminance detail&quot;) rather than variations in hue (&quot;chroma detail&quot;). Most photographic noise reduction algorithms split the image detail into chroma and luminance components and apply more noise reduction to the former or allows the user to control chroma and luminance noise reduction separately.

==== Linear smoothing filters ====
One method to remove noise is by convolving the original image with a mask that represents a low-pass filter or smoothing operation. For example, the Gaussian mask comprises elements determined by a Gaussian function. This convolution brings the value of each pixel into closer harmony with the values of its neighbors. In general, a smoothing filter sets each pixel to the average value, or a weighted average, of itself and its nearby neighbors; the Gaussian filter is just one possible set of weights.

Smoothing filters tend to blur an image because pixel intensity values that are significantly higher or lower than the surrounding neighborhood &quot;smear&quot; across the area. Because of this blurring, linear filters are seldom used in practice for noise reduction; they are, however, often used as the basis for nonlinear noise reduction filters.

==== Anisotropic diffusion ====
Another method for removing noise is to evolve the image under a smoothing partial differential equation similar to the heat equation, which is called anisotropic diffusion. With a spatially constant diffusion coefficient, this is equivalent to the heat equation or linear Gaussian filtering, but with a diffusion coefficient designed to detect edges, the noise can be removed without blurring the edges of the image.

==== Non-local means ====
Another approach for removing noise is based on non-local averaging of all the pixels in an image. In particular, the amount of weighting for a pixel is based on the degree of similarity between a small patch centered on that pixel and the small patch centered on the pixel being de-noised.

==== Nonlinear filters ====
A median filter is an example of a nonlinear filter and, if properly designed, is very good at preserving image detail. To run a median filter:
# consider each pixel in the image
# sort the neighbouring pixels into order based upon their intensities
# replace the original value of the pixel with the median value from the list

A median filter is a rank-selection (RS) filter, a particularly harsh member of the family of rank-conditioned rank-selection (RCRS) filters; a much milder member of that family, for example one that selects the closest of the neighboring values when a pixel&#x27;s value is external in its neighborhood, and leaves it unchanged otherwise, is sometimes preferred, especially in photographic applications.

Median and other RCRS filters are good at removing salt and pepper noise from an image, and also cause relatively little blurring of edges, and hence are often used in computer vision applications.

==== Wavelet transform ====
The main aim of an image denoising algorithm is to achieve both noise reduction and feature preservation using the wavelet filter banks. In this context, wavelet-based methods are of particular interest. In the wavelet domain, the noise is uniformly spread throughout coefficients while most of the image information is concentrated in a few large ones. Therefore, the first wavelet-based denoising methods were based on thresholding of detail subband coefficients. However, most of the wavelet thresholding methods suffer from the drawback that the chosen threshold may not match the specific distribution of signal and noise components at different scales and orientations.

To address these disadvantages, nonlinear estimators based on Bayesian theory have been developed. In the Bayesian framework, it has been recognized that a successful denoising algorithm can achieve both noise reduction and feature preservation if it employs an accurate statistical description of the signal and noise components.

==== Statistical methods ====
Statistical methods for image denoising exist as well. For Gaussian noise, one can model the pixels in a greyscale image as auto-normally distributed, where each pixel&#x27;s &quot;true&quot; greyscale value is normally distributed with mean equal to the average greyscale value of its neighboring pixels and a given variance.

Let formula_1 denote the pixels adjacent to the pixel. Then the conditional distribution of the greyscale intensity (on a formula_2 scale) at the node is
formula_3
for a chosen parameter formula_4 and variance formula_5. One method of denoising that uses the auto-normal model uses the image data as a Bayesian prior and the auto-normal density as a likelihood function, with the resulting posterior distribution offering a mean or mode as a denoised image.

==== Block-matching algorithms ====

A block-matching algorithm can be applied to group similar image fragments of overlapping macroblocks of identical size. Stacks of similar macroblocks are then filtered together in the transform domain and each image fragment is finally restored to its original location using a weighted average of the overlapping pixels.

==== Random field ====

Shrinkage fields is a random field-based machine learning technique that brings performance comparable to that of Block-matching and 3D filtering yet requires much lower computational overhead such that it can be performed directly within embedded systems.

==== Deep learning ====
Various deep learning approaches have been proposed to achieve noise reduction and such image restoration tasks. Deep Image Prior is one such technique that makes use of convolutional neural network and is notable in that it requires no prior training data.

=== Software ===
Most general-purpose image and photo editing software will have one or more noise-reduction functions (median, blur, despeckle, etc.).

<doc id="476839" wikidata="Q679199" url="?curid=476839" title="Alpha course">
<text>The Alpha course is an evangelistic course that seeks to introduce the basics of the Christian faith through a series of talks and discussions. It is described by its organisers as &quot;an opportunity to explore the meaning of life&quot;. Alpha courses are run in churches, homes, workplaces, prisons, universities and a wide variety of other locations. The course began in Britain and is run around the world by various Christian denominations.

== History ==

Alpha originated in 1977 with the work of Charles Marnham, a curate at Holy Trinity Brompton (HTB), a parish of the Church of England in London. It started as a course for church members regarding the basics of beliefs commonly held by many believers in Christ, but then began to be used as an introduction for those interested in the faith. John Irvine, Marnham&#x27;s successor curate at HTB, took over the running of the course in 1981 and developed the 10-week format that continues to this day. In 1985 Nicky Lee took on the course, and in 1990 Nicky Gumbel, then also curate at Holy Trinity, took over the running of the course at the invitation of Sandy Millar (vicar at that time) and oversaw its revision and expansion.

Alpha grew rapidly in Britain in the 1990s, from just four courses in 1991 to 2,500 in 1995. It reached a peak in 1998, when 10,500 courses were run. By 2001 this figure had fallen to 7,300. In 2018 the Alpha website described the course as running in over 100 countries and in over 100 languages, with more than 24 million people having taken the course.
 the Alpha website states that the course &quot;has been translated into 112 different languages&quot;.

Courses have been run by Anglican, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Baptist, Methodist, Pentecostal, Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches, with some variations in course material.

== Structure ==

Alpha is organised as a series of sessions over 10 weeks, including a day or weekend away. Each session starts with a meal, followed by a talk and then discussion in small groups. The talks aim to cover the basic beliefs of the Christian faith.

In April 2016, Alpha introduced the Alpha Film Series, where traditional Alpha content is shown in a series of films, featuring stories and interviews. This series is mainly presented by Nicky Gumbel, Toby Flint (a curate at Holy Trinity Brompton) and Gemma Hunt. Interviewees include Bear Grylls, Jackie Pullinger, and Raniero Cantalamessa.

=== Religious education for schools ===

In conjunction with Youth for Christ, Alpha International produces two study programmes designed for children aged 11–14, &quot;exploRE: The Christian Faith&quot; a 12-week programme on the Christian faith, and &quot;exploRE: The Life of Jesus&quot;, a 14-lesson study of Jesus&#x27; birth, life, death and resurrection. The capitalised RE is a reference to religious education, part of the British curriculum. The materials are aimed at religious education teachers.

=== Relationship programmes ===

Several relationship-oriented programmes have emerged alongside Alpha that are now separately run by a sister organisation called Relationship Central. The Marriage Course is a seven-session course for married couples, consisting of a &quot;candlelit meal and/or coffee, tea and dessert at a romantic table for two while listening to practical talks that are informative and fun, either given live or played on DVD&quot;, while the Marriage Preparation Course follows a similar format over five sessions in preparation for married life. Unlike Alpha, there are no group sessions - the couple are to spend the time together, and relationship details are not shared with a counsellor or other participants. The Marriage Course was adopted by the British Army and an additional session on enforced separation (e.g. as a result of operational deployment) was added by a military couple working in co-operation with Relationship Central. In 2012, DVD versions of the Parenting Children Course (for parents or caregivers of children aged 0–10) and the Parenting Teenagers Course (11-18) were released. Unlike the Marriage Course, the parenting courses use a similar format to Alpha: a meal followed by a talk and group discussions.

The website says about these courses that while they are &quot;based on Christian principles&quot;, they are &quot;designed for all couples with or without a church background&quot;. The courses are authored by Nicky Lee and Sila Lee, staff at Holy Trinity Brompton and authors of &quot;The Marriage Book&quot; and &quot;The Parenting Book&quot;.

=== Caring for ex-offenders ===

Caring for ex-offenders is a follow-up to the Alpha for Prisons course, supporting released prisoners by providing them with material assistance including accommodation, work, food, and pastoral support through church life. It operates in Britain, Canada, South Africa and the United States.

=== St Paul&#x27;s Theological Centre ===

St Paul&#x27;s Theological Centre is Alpha/Holy Trinity Brompton&#x27;s theological institution, with aims to provide lay and clerical training in theology and resources for theological training in churches across the world, as well as theological guidance for Alpha.

== Doctrine ==
Alpha&#x27;s teachings are intended to centre upon aspects of Christian faith on which all denominations are in general agreement. Nicky Gumbel says (quoting the current Apostolic Preacher Raniero Cantalamessa), &quot;What unites us is infinitely greater than what divides us.&quot;

Distinctive Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox tenets, such as those concerning the Virgin Mary and certain sacramental teachings, are absent, as are Baptist teachings on baptism.

The New International Version of the Bible is quoted in the course materials.

Three of the fifteen sessions are given to the person and work of the Holy Spirit and cover the infilling of the Spirit; speaking in tongues and healing via prayer. Conversion stories in the book of Acts (see 2:1ff, 9:17-19, 10:44-46, 19:1-6) are seen as normative.

== Influences ==
Alpha&#x27;s greatest influence came from the ministry of John Wimber, who visited Holy Trinity Brompton a number of times during the 1980s and 1990s. Nicky Gumbel&#x27;s approach is linked to the Iwerne camps ministry of E. J. H. Nash, an influential Anglican cleric who set out to evangelise &quot;top boys at top schools&quot; and who organised summer camps at Iwerne Minster in Dorset. David Fletcher, who took responsibility for the camps after Nash, described Alpha as: &quot;basically the Iwerne camp talk scheme with charismatic stuff added on.&quot; Rob Warner addresses both, when he says: &quot;Alpha can ... be summed up as [Nash] camp rationalistic conservatism combined with Wimberist charismatic expressivism ... this is a highly unusual, even paradoxical hybrid.&quot;

== Usage ==

Although originating from the evangelical Anglican tradition, Alpha is now used in various denominations around the world. Its supporters include many Catholic cardinals, Anglican archbishops and bishops, and leading figures of all denominations. Former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey described the courses as &quot;superb.&quot; Rowan Williams was an enthusiastic supporter when he was Bishop of Monmouth and Archbishop of Wales, and he continued his support as Archbishop of Canterbury, opening an Alpha conference and accepting an invitation to speak at an Alpha supper in London in 2004. He has described it as &quot;a very special tool&quot; and &quot;a unique mixture of Christian content and Christian style&quot;. Father Raniero Cantalamessa, a monk of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin and Preacher to the Papal Household for Pope Benedict XVI wrote a document praising Alpha in June 2005.

== Criticism==
Alpha been criticised for having a charismatic emphasis, with some non-charismatic evangelicals criticising Gumbel&#x27;s emphasis upon the person and work of the Holy Spirit in particular.

More conservative critics (especially from a Reformed and evangelical perspective) have complained that the course does not adequately define sin, and therefore does not properly explain the reason for Jesus&#x27;s death and resurrection. The alternative Christianity Explored course is an attempt to go beyond what Alpha teaches on sin.

John Vincent of the Urban Theology Unit in Sheffield has suggested that Alpha presents too narrow a version of Christianity and one too centred on what theologians have said about Jesus, rather than allowing students the freedom to draw their own inspiration from studying Jesus&#x27; life and teaching. &quot;The Alpha course, because of its didactic style, its narrow-mindedness and its closed nature, doesn&#x27;t facilitate alternative views&quot;, he says. &quot;I happen to believe it therefore leads people into a self-centred religion which is not the same as the genuine Christian discipleship.&quot;

Some Catholics have criticised the fifteen-session &quot;Alpha in a Catholic Context&quot; version of the course for being unbalanced without sufficiently presenting some Roman Catholic doctrines, which instead need to be added afterwards in additional sessions.

<doc id="476841" wikidata="Q2259802" url="?curid=476841" title="Female guards in Nazi concentration camps">
<text> (, pl. ) was the position title for a female guard in Nazi concentration camps. Of the 50,000 guards who served in the concentration camps, training records indicate that approximately 3,500 were women. In 1942, the first female guards arrived at Auschwitz and Majdanek from Ravensbrück. The year after, the Nazis began conscripting women because of a shortage of male guards. In the context of these camps, the German position title of translates to (female) &quot;overseer&quot; or &quot;attendant&quot;. Later female guards were dispersed to Bolzano (1944–1945), Kaiserwald-Riga (1943–44), Mauthausen (March – May 1945), Stutthof (1942–1945), Vaivara (1943–1944), Vught (1943–1944), and at Nazi concentration camps, subcamps, work camps, detention camps and other posts.


==Recruitment==

Female guards were generally from the lower to middle classes and had no relevant work experience. Their occupational backgrounds varied: one source mentions former prison matrons, hairdressers, tramcar-conductors, or retired teachers. Volunteers were recruited via advertisements in German newspapers asking for women to show their love for the Reich and join the SS-Gefolge (&quot;SS-Retinue&quot;, a &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) support and service organisation for women). Additionally, some were conscripted based on data in their SS files. Adolescent enrollment in the League of German Girls acted as a vehicle of indoctrination for many of the women. At one of the post-war hearings, Herta Haase-Breitmann-Schmidt, head female overseer, claimed that her female guards were not full-fledged SS women. Consequently, at some tribunals it was disputed whether &quot;SS-Helferinnen&quot; employed at the camps were official members of the SS, thus leading to conflicting court decisions. Many of them belonged to the Waffen-SS and to the SS-Helferinnen Corps.

While training records suggest that as many as 3,500 women were employed as camp guards, some sources estimate a much lower number, between 50 and 190.

==Supervision levels and ranks==

Female guards were collectively known as &quot;SS-Helferin&quot; (German: &quot;SS Helper women&quot;). The supervisory levels within the &quot;SS-Helferin&quot; were as follows: 
#&quot;Chef Oberaufseherin&quot;, &quot;chief senior overseer&quot; [Ravensbrück]
#&quot;Lagerführerin&quot;, &quot;camp leader&quot; 
#&quot;Oberaufseherin&quot;, &quot;senior overseer&quot; 
#&quot;Erstaufseherin&quot;, &quot;First Guard&quot; [senior overseer in some satellite camps]
#&quot;Rapportführerin&quot;, &quot;Report Leader&quot;
#&quot;Arbeitsdienstführerin&quot;, &quot;work recording leader&quot;
#&quot;Arbeitseinsatzführerin&quot;, &quot;work input overseer&quot; 
#&quot;Blockführerin&quot;, &quot;Block Leader&quot; 
#&quot;Kommandoführerin&quot;, &quot;Work Squad Leader&quot; [senior overseer in some satellite camps]
#&quot;Hundeführerin&quot;, &quot;Dog Guide Overseer&quot; 
#&quot;Aufseherin&quot;, &quot;Overseer&quot;

==Daily life==

Relations between SS men and female guards are said to have existed in many of the camps, and Heinrich Himmler had told the SS men to regard the female guards as equals and comrades. At the relatively small Helmbrechts subcamp near Hof, Germany, the camp commandant, Wilhelm Dörr, openly pursued a sexual relationship with the head female overseer Herta Haase-Breitmann-Schmidt.

Corruption was another aspect of the female guard culture. Ilse Koch, known as &quot;The Witch of Buchenwald&quot;, was married to the camp commandant, Karl Koch. Both were rumored to have embezzled millions of Reichsmark, for which Karl Koch was convicted and executed by the Nazis a few weeks before Buchenwald was liberated by the U.S. Army; however, Ilse was cleared of the charge. Convicted of war crimes, she was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1951.

One apparent exception to the brutal female overseer prototype was Klara Kunig, a camp guard in 1944 who served at Ravensbrück and its subcamp at Dresden-Universelle. The head wardress at the camp pointed out that she was too polite and too kind towards the inmates, resulting in her subsequent dismissal from camp duty in January 1945. Her fate has been unknown since 13 February 1945, the date of the allied firebombing of Dresden.

==Camps, names and ranks==

Near the end of the war, women were forced from factories in the German Labour Exchange and sent to training centres. Women were also trained on a smaller scale at the camps of Neuengamme; Auschwitz I, II, and III; Flossenbürg (as well as Dresden-Goehle, Holleischen and Zwodau); Gross Rosen (as well as its satellites in Langenbielau, Ober Hohenelbe and Parschnitz); Stutthof, as well as a few at Mauthausen. Most of these women came from the regions around the camps. In 1944, the first female overseers were stationed at the satellite camps belonging to Neuengamme, Dachau, Mauthausen, a very few at Natzweiler-Struthof, and none at the Mittelbau-Dora complex until March 1945.

Twenty-eight served in Vught, some at Buchenwald, 60 in Bergen-Belsen, one at Dachau overseeing the brothel, more than 30 in Mauthausen (January 1945–May 1945), 30 at Majdanek, around 200 at Auschwitz and its subcamps, 140 at Sachsenhausen and its subcamps, 158 trained at Neuengamme, 47 trained at Stutthof, compared to 958 who served in Ravensbrück, 561 in the Flossenbürg complex, and over 800 in the Gross Rosen. Many female supervisors were trained and/or worked at subcamps in Germany, Poland, France, Austria, and Czechoslovakia.

*The head overseer at Allendorf was SS-Oberaufseherin/Erstaufseherin Kaethe Hoern (September 1944–March 1945) while her assistant was SS-Stellvertretende Oberaufseherin Hildegard K.; in Auschwitz Oberaufseherin Johanna Langefeld (March 1942–October 1942), Lagerfuehrerin Maria Mandl (October 1942–November 1944), Stellvertetende Oberaufseherin Emma Zimmer (1942–43), Stellvertretende Lagerfuehrerin Margot Dreschel (late 1943–November 1944), Arbeitsdienstfuehrerin Elisabeth Hasse, Oberaufseherin Elisabeth Volkenrath (November 1944–January 1945), and Rapportfuehrerin Irma Grese (1944–of Hungarian Jewish women&#x27;s compound under Mandl, Dreschel and Hasse), Mandl herself commanded all the SS women within Auschwitz-Birkenau. Grese and Volkenrath were convicted of war crimes and hanged on 13 December 1945; Mandl was hanged on 24 January 1948.

*Ravensbrück was the central and largest training ground for female guards. The first Oberaufseherin was Margarete Stollberg who organized construction operations at the camp in a very minor capacity until May 1939. Immediately after the camp was opened Johanna Langefeld became SS-Oberaufseherin (May 1939–March 1942) and Emma Zimmer became her deputy, (&quot;SS-Stellvertretende Oberaufseherin&quot;) (May 1939–October 1942); Maria Mandl also served during this period as an SS-Kommandoführerin (1939–1940) and Ober-Arrestführerin. of the camp bunker (1940–March 1942) while Gertrud Rabestein served as SS-Blockführerin of the Punishment Barrack and SS-Leiterin of the SS-Hundeführerinnen (1939–1941) and Gertrud Ida Schreiter served as an SS-Hundeführerin and SS-Kommandoführerin. After Langefeld was assigned to Auschwitz I during March 1942, Maria Mandl became SS-Oberaufseherin (March 1942–October 1942), followed by Johanna Langefeld, who once again served at Ravensbrück until the summer of 1943.

Camp authorities promoted longtime Aufseherin Anne Klein-Plaubel to Chief Senior Overseer (Chef Oberaufseherin) of Ravensbrck during August 1943, assisted by Stellvertretende Oberaufseherin Dorothea Binz and under them were SS-Scharführerin Christel Jankowsky, SS-Ober-arrestführerin Margarete Mewes, and SS-Blockführerinnen Henny Gottwitz (Block 3) and Ulla Jürß (1943–1944). During March 1944, Wilhelmine Pielen returned to Ravensbrück from Neubrandenburg and became assistant to Leader Binz until her transfer to Konigsberg-Neumark during October 1944. During this time, Arbeitsdienstführerin Gertrud Ida Schreiter (born Kaufmann) was the female Leader of the Labor Department, and her second-in-commands were Arbeitseinsatzführerinnen Greta Bösel (born Müller)–in 1944 and a certain Helevead (or Hollevaed) also served in Department IIIa; additionally, Helene Massar was a Kommandoführerin of the sewing shop at the camp until 1945. In the late autumn of 1944, Auschwitz-Birkenau Aufseherin Luise Brunner was installed as Chef Oberaufseherin at Ravensbrück. Under Brunner were Oberaufseherin Binz, Arbeitsdienstführerin Schreiter, Arbeitsdienstführerin Ilse Vettermann, Stellvertretende Oberaufseherin Else Krippner, SS-Stellvertretende Oberaufseherin Wilhelmine Pielen (after her return from Konigsberg-Neumark in February/March 1945-she replaced Krippner) and Arbeitseinsatzführerinnen Greta Bösel and Hollevaed-were around 144 SS-Aufseherinnen (SS-Overseers), including Report Overseers (Rapportführerinnen) Knack, Olga Nickel (who began service prior to the summer of 1942) and Hildegard Knop.

*In researching his maternal German kin, American historian James L. Cabot found that two of his distant relations were overseers – Maria Kleinschmidt, an operative at Neuengamme, and Charlotte Kleinschmidt (née Peters), whose exact camp service is unknown.

Prisoner Olga Lengyel, who in her memoir, &quot;Five Chimneys&quot;, wrote that selections in the women’s camp were made by SS Aufseherin Elisabeth Hasse and Irma Grese. Other survivors accused Juana Bormann, Elisabeth Volkenrath, Elisabeth Ruppert and Margot Dreschel for the same crimes.

==Later events==

In 1996, a story broke in Germany about Margot Pietzner (married name Kunz), a former Aufseherin from Ravensbrück, the Belzig subcamp and a subcamp at Wittenberg. She was originally sentenced to death by a Soviet court, but it was commuted to a life sentence, and she was released in 1956. In the early 1990s, at the age of 74, Pietzner was awarded the title &quot;Stalinist victim&quot; and given 64,350 Deutsche Marks (32,902 Euros). Many historians argued that she had lied and did not deserve the money. She had, in fact, served time in a German prison which was overseen by the Soviets, but she was imprisoned because she had served at three concentration camps.

The only female guard to tell her story to the public was Herta Bothe, who served as a guard at Ravensbrück in 1942, then at Stutthof, Bromberg-Ost subcamp, and finally in Bergen-Belsen. She received ten years&#x27; imprisonment and was released in the mid-1950s. In a rare interview recorded in 1999, Bothe was asked if she regretted being a guard in a concentration camp. Her response was, &quot;What do you mean? ... I made a mistake, no... The mistake was that it was a concentration camp, but I had to go to it—otherwise I would have been put into it myself, that was my mistake.&quot; Though Bothe claimed that refusal of the position of guard would have seen her placed in the camp herself – an explanation given by many female ex-guards – it was unlikely to have been true, as records from the time showed some new recruits leaving their positions at Ravensbrück, facing no recorded negative consequences for doing so.

In 2006, 84-year-old San Francisco resident Elfriede Rinkel was deported by the US Justice Department to Germany; Rinkel had worked at Ravensbrück from June 1944 to April 1945, and had used an SS-trained dog in the camp. She had hidden her secret for more than 60 years from her family, friends and Jewish-German husband Fred. Rinkel immigrated to the US in 1959 seeking a better life, and had omitted Ravensbrück from the list of residences supplied on her visa application. In Germany, Rinkel did not face criminal charges, with the expiry of the statute of limitations meaning that only murder allegations could be tried after such a length of time. The case continued to be examined until Rinkel&#x27;s death in 2018.

<text>San Miguel de Tucumán (), usually called simply Tucumán, is the capital and largest city of Tucumán Province, located in northern Argentina from Buenos Aires. It is the fifth-largest city of Argentina after Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Rosario and Mendoza and the most important of the northern region. The Spanish conquistador Diego de Villarroel founded the city in 1565 in the course of an expedition from present-day Peru. Tucumán moved to its present site in 1685.

==Overview==

The city is bordered on the north by Las Talitas (Tafí Viejo), on the east by Banda del Río Salí and Alderetes (Cruz Alta), on the west by the city of Yerba Buena, and on the south by Lules.

The city is located on the slopes of the Aconquija mountains, the easternmost mountain range before the large Chaco-Pampean flats. It is the commercial center of an irrigated area that produces large quantities of sugarcane, rice, tobacco, and fruit, giving the province its nickname, the Garden of the Republic. The National University of Tucumán (1914) and the Saint Thomas Aquinas University of the North (1965) are in the city.

On July 9, 1816, a congress gathered in Tucumán declared independence from Spain, which did not officially recognize it until 1862. The meeting place of the congress, the House of Tucumán, has been reconstructed as a national monument. After the national government broke down in 1820, the town was capital of the short-lived Republic of Tucumán.

Its telephone code is 0381, and its postal codes are T4000 (Center), T4001 (North), T4002 (South) and T4003 (East).

== Climate ==

San Miguel de Tucuman lies in a transition zone between temperate climates to the south, and subtropical climates to the north. It has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cwa&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification, with vastly more precipitation in the summer than in the winter. The average annual temperature is . The precipitation pattern is monsoonal: out of the that fall annually, most of it falls in the summer months, while the winter months tend to be drier. The average temperature in winter is . July is the coldest month with a mean temperature of . Frosts are uncommon, with some years recording no frosts at all. Usually, when frosts occur, they are light with temperatures rarely falling below . Winters are sunny, averaging 9–12 clear days and 9–12 overcast days per month. Snow is extremely rare, but in 2007, it reached the city center. There have been other episodes of sleet and snow in the mountains around the city, and in 2010, sleet was reported downtown again, a very rare event.

Spring and fall are transition seasons. Springs are very short, and by October, summer weather settles in the city, with highs beyond very common. This is due to the dryness of the season: daytime highs are close to those in the summer, when rainfall and clouds are persistent, whereas spring is often sunny and arid. April marks the beginning of the fall, but temperatures remain near summer levels: during the day, and during the night. Rainfall decreases as fall progresses.

Summers are the hottest and most humid time of year. The average temperature during the summer ranges from . In the summer, one can expect daytime highs ranging from ; at night, are the norm. Much of the rainfall that the city receives occurs during the summer months and cloudy weather tends to be more common, averaging 11–13 overcast days and only 2–4 clear days per month. Heat waves can push temperatures up to . However, some relief is possible after cold fronts from the south caused by Pampero winds which brings in cooler air. These winds can be strong following a hot day in advance of the cold fronts.

The highest temperature recorded was on October 31, 2009 while the lowest temperature recorded was on July 16, 1962.

== History ==

The first foundation of &quot;San Miguel de Tucumán y Nueva Tierra de Promisión&quot; was on May 31, 1565 by Diego de Villarroel in the Campos de Ibatín, to the southwest from where the current city is located nowadays. The city was moved to &quot;La Toma&quot; (where the old town or &quot;casco histórico&quot; is placed today) in 1685, due to the low quality of Ibatín water.

On September 24, 1812, the Battle of Tucumán took place near the city, when the Spanish army coming from Upper Peru were defeated by the army led by Manuel Belgrano. Belgrano had been obliged to fall back to Córdoba by the government of Buenos Aires, but the inhabitants of Tucumán called on him to resist another Spanish invasion.

With his troops almost unarmed and tired but reinforced by local gauchos (calling themselves&quot;Los decididos de Tucumán&quot;), Belgrano attacked the Spanish army from behind, defeating them and ensuring the Independence of Argentina. After the battle of Tucumán, the same army led by Belgrano would achieve another victory in Salta.

After those battles, Belgrano established a circular fortress known as &quot;La Ciudadela&quot;, located from the current Plaza de la Independencia (former Plaza Mayor). Because it had patriot barracks and was located on an intermediate point between the Río de la Plata and the Upper Peru and Santa Cruz de la Sierra, San Miguel de Tucumán was designated as the venue for the Congress of Independence. On July 9, 1816, the Independence of Argentina was declared, not only from Spain but from any other foreign domination. The act of the Independence was signed at the Casa de Tucumán, also named &quot;Casa Histórica&quot; or &quot;Casa de la Independencia&quot;.

By 1850 the city&#x27;s population had increased considerably, surpassing the estimated registers. Because of that, in 1870 it was proposed that the city be expanded, setting new limits. During those years, the first railway line reached the city, built by British-owned Córdoba Central Railway. The immigrants arriving in the region (most of whom were Spanish, Arabic, Jewish, and Italian) influenced the architectural style that adapted to those new cultures, leaving the original colonial style behind. Therefore, new buildings in the city were made in Neoclassical, eclectic and picturesque styles.

During the first years of the 20th century, the city added for recreational uses, and the first great park (similar to those existing in Paris and London) was thus established. By 1930 the city&#x27;s population had doubled.

== Cultural and tourist heritage ==


The House of Government of Tucumán was built in Art Nouveau style at the end of 19th century. The White Room is commonly used to receive notable people who visit the city.

In the city downtown, the San Miguel de Tucumán Cathedral still preserves some colonial elements and other elements from Italian architecture. The Basílica de San Francisco (also declared a historical heritage), the Parroquia de San Roque, Basílica del Santísimo Sacramento (known as &quot;Iglesia de Santo Domingo&quot;), Basílica de Nuestra Señora de la Merced and the Iglesia Nuestra Señora de Lourdes are some of the most important churches of the city.

The Casa de Tucumán (or &quot;Casa de la Independencia&quot;), as the site of the declaration of independence of Argentina, is the most significant building in the city. After the Congress of Tucumán various people lived in the house and deterioration became visible over the years, which is clearly evident in the famous photo taken by Angel Paganelli in 1869. The Government of Argentina acquired the historic house in 1874 with a view to its serving as a post office. Starting in the 1880s celebrations took place in the building to commemorate Independence.

Nevertheless, the government did not remodel the house until 1903, when it was demolished almost completely due to its very poor condition. The only room that was preserved from demolition was the room where the Independence was declared by the congressists. In 1942 the house was completely rebuilt, based on the original plans and the picture taken by Paganelli in 1869. For that purpose, the same kind of bricks, tejas (roof tiles) and baldosas (stone floor tiles) were used.

Other notable buildings of San Miguel include the Teatro San Martín (with some elements in neoclassical style), and the Correo Central, made in a mix of styles and a tower inspired in the palaces of Florence (specially Palazzo Vecchio), the old Legislature, the Palace of Justice, the Casino (former Savoy Hotel, built in 1912), the birthplace of Nicolás Avellaneda, the Colegio Nacional Bartolomé Mitre and the Campo de las Carreras, where the battle of Tucumán took place and which is now an historical park.

== Cultural life and education ==

For decades, San Miguel de Tucumán has been one of the cultural spots in the country, in part due to the influence of the National University of Tucumán. It has been the birthplace and/or home of well-known personalities such as folk singer Mercedes Sosa, author Tomas Eloy Martínez, a professor at Rutgers University in the United States; musician Miguel Ángel Estrella, artist/architect Tomás Saraceno, painter Luis Lobo de la Vega, and many others.

Two large theatres (San Martín and Alberdi) and several smaller and independent theaters offer a wide array of events, including plays, concerts, operas, and ballet, all year round. The &quot;Septiembre Musical&quot; is by far the most important cultural event during the year. This music festival, generally held at Independence Square, brings together several local and national artists who perform different musical styles ranging from folk music to rock.

Universities in the city include the public National University of Tucumán and the National Technological University, and the private (and Catholic) Saint Thomas Aquinas University of the North and the Saint Paul T University.

Since August 2008, the city has been the location of trials of high-ranking former military officers charged with war crimes from the 1976–83 dictatorship. Luciano Menéndez, a former colonel, was convicted for crimes against humanity, including the kidnapping and disappearance of senator (Guillermo Vargas Aignasse) on the night of the &quot;golpe&quot; (coup) in 1976. Many Abuelas de la Plaza de Mayo (Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo) have been seen in and around the Tucumán trials. The convictions of Menéndez and Ricardo Bussi were the first of this round of prosecution of military leaders of the Jorge Rafael Videla dictatorship. Their sentencings were seen as symbolic victories for the mothers and grandmothers whose children or husbands were &quot;disappeared&quot; by the military during that dark period of Argentine history.

==Sports==
Association football is the most popular sport in the city. San Miguel&#x27;s main football clubs are Club Atlético San Martín de Tucumán and Club Atlético Tucumán. Club Atletico San Martín is based out of San Miguel de Tucumán and was founded in 1909. This team has won four total national titles (1944, 1988, 2005, and 2007–08) and several regional titles. The longtime rival, Club Atletico Tucumán, is also based in the city of San Miguel de Tucumán but was founded in 1901. This team is the oldest football club in the Tucumán Province and the team has five national titles (1959, 2004, 2005, 2007–08, and 2008–09) and also many regional titles.
Basketball is also a popular sport, some clubs are Juan Bautista Alberdi Club, Central Córdoba Club, Belgrano Club, Villa Luján Club, Tucumán BB Club and others. Tucumán was one of two co-hosts of the 1995 FIBA Americas Championship.

The city is also a rugby union hotbed and hosts the Unión de Rugby de Tucumán, as well as the province&#x27;s two most successful clubs: Tucumán Rugby Club and Universitario. The rugby of Tucumán is the second most powerful in the Argentine, behind the Rugby of the Buenos Aires Union. For eight times, the &quot;Naranjas&quot; (Oranges) won the Argentine Championship of Unions; this is the greatest number won by a hinterland union. Other important rugby clubs of the city are Natación y Gimnasia, Cardenales, Tucumán Lawn Tennis, Los Tarcos, amongst others. The fans of the rugby of Tucumán are the most passionate among the Argentines.

==Transport==
The city is served by several bus lines that have routes within the city limits, and some others that connect it to the neighbouring cities of Yerba Buena, El Manantial, Tafí Viejo, Las Talitas, Banda del Río Salí, and Alderetes. San Miguel de Tucumán enjoys one of the largest bus stations in Argentina. The 30,000 m2 estación central de ómnibus (opened in 1994) is the point from where hundreds of bus services arrive from and depart to almost all of the largest and mid-size cities throughout the country.

The Teniente General Benjamín Matienzo International Airport (TUC/SANT) is the city&#x27;s airport (though located east of the city, in the neighboring department of Cruz Alta) serving over 290,000 passengers a year. There are daily flights to Buenos Aires, Jujuy, Santiago del Estero, Campo Arenal, the Minera Alumbrera Gold Mine, as well as international flights to Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia. The Mauricio Gilli Aerodrome is a private airport, located west from the city, for private aviation. It is locally known as Aeroclub.

The city has also four railway stations, with only the Mitre Railway terminus operating passenger trains to Retiro in Buenos Aires, with intermediate stops in Santiago del Estero and Santa Fe provinces amongst other stations. The other train station active is Belgrano Railway station, originally built by the Córdoba Central Railway and currently operated by freight company Trenes Argentinos Cargas y Logística.

Railway stations in San Martín de Tucumán:

Notes:
* 1 &quot;Also known as &quot;El Bajo&quot; station, the building is currently a Municipal unit&quot;.
* 2 &quot;The line was also known as &quot;Provincial&quot; before being acquired by the Cordoba Central Railway in 1899.&quot;

== Media ==
San Miguel de Tucumán is home to two free-to-air television stations (&quot;Channel 8&quot; and &quot;Channel 10&quot;), four newspapers (&quot;La Gaceta&quot;, &quot;El Siglo&quot;, &quot;El Periódico&quot;, &quot;El Tribuno de Tucumán&quot;), three cable television companies (CCC, ATS, and TCC), and several radio stations.

== Healthcare ==
San Miguel de Tucuman is part of the Provincial Health System (Sistema Provincial de Salud or SIPROSA). This system divided the Tucuman province into four systematic areas with San Miguel being in its own area. Each area has its own public hospitals and Health Primary Attention Centers for the people. This divisions purpose was to help regulate health care assistance across the population and make it more accessible. Since then, SIPROSA has been a part of a modernizing program with the government in trying to make a successful medical records system. This would collect data from all the different resources and compile it into one database making it a lot easier and quicker for patients to pull up medical history, medical records, or anything of that nature. This is a big step for the Tucuman region.

<text>Maria Mandl (also spelled Mandel; 10 January 1912 – 24 January 1948) was an Austrian and a war criminal notorious for her role in the Holocaust as a top-ranking official at the Auschwitz II-Birkenau and Ravensbrück concentration camps. She was executed for committing crimes against humanity.

==Early life==
Maria Mandl was born on 10 January 1912, in Münzkirchen, Austria-Hungary, to shoemaker Franz Mandl and Anna Streibl. She grew up on her family&#x27;s farm alongside three elder siblings, Georg, Anna, and Aloisia. Mandl&#x27;s father was well-known in the community for speaking out against the Nazi Party, instead aligning with the Christian Social Party (CSP). After the war, he served on the party&#x27;s District Council.

In order to assist with the family farm, Mandl withdrew from school on 20 July 1924, at the age of twelve, without an exit certificate. However, in 1927, with her father&#x27;s financial support, she was accepted into a Catholic boarding school in Neuhaus am Inn, where she studied for the next three years.

After graduating, Mandl struggled to find work in Münzkirchen, so she relocated to Brig, Valais, Switzerland, where she worked as a housekeeper and cook. Mandl resigned from her position after thirteen months due to homesickness and returned to Austria to live with her parents until 1934. She eventually found work as a maid at a private villa in Innsbruck. She ultimately left this job in 1936 and returned home once again when her mother and father&#x27;s health began to decline. The following year, she began working at the Münzkirchen post office and became engaged to a local man.

The annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938 resulted in the separation of Mandl and her fiancé, who believed that the Mandl family&#x27;s involvement with the CSP would harm his reputation as a Nazi soldier, as well as the loss of her position at the post office. Mandl was fired because her family was affiliated with the CSP, according to Münzkirchen residents, contradicting Mandl&#x27;s claims that she was fired because she &quot;had no identity as a National Socialist&quot;.

==Work as a ==
===KZ Lichtenburg (1938–1939)===
Mandl moved to Munich in September 1938 to live with her uncle, a police constable, in the hopes that he would help her get a job in the police force. There were no open positions, so her uncle encouraged her to take the position of at the Lichtenburg concentration camp in Prettin. In a subsequent interview, Mandl stated that she accepted the position because of the decent pay and the expectation that she would earn more than a nurse. She also claimed that she &quot;knew nothing about what the concentration camps were&quot;.

Mandl went through a standardized training program that included classes on Nazi philosophy and the proper attitude toward the Third Reich, as well as a twenty-question exam that assessed her knowledge of history, geography, and key dates in the Nazi Party. Her views on race and global issues were also examined. After meeting the requirements, Mandl was promoted to &quot;Aufseherin&quot; and permitted to work on the Lichtenburg camp grounds. For the first three months, she was working on a trial basis and supervised by one of her more experienced coworkers.

At Lichtenburg, Mandl worked under Max Kögl, who influenced her sadistic behavior, and Johanna Langefeld. Punitive exercises known as &quot;sport&quot; were forced upon prisoners, and Sunday beatings and whippings were common. Mandl was involved in the perpetration of these violent acts, according to Lichtenburg survivors Emilie Neu and Lina Haag, who described Mandl beating women, whilst they were naked and strapped to a wooden post, with a dogwhip. This is in addition to an incident in which Mandl repeatedly struck a prisoner with a key until they were unconscious, then dragged her by her knees across the camp and into a solitary cell.

A Lichtenburg survivor recalled an interaction with Mandl in the woman&#x27;s early days at the camp. In response to the survivor&#x27;s assertion that she is &quot;too pretty to play supervisor&quot;, Mandl replied, &quot;No, I swore the oath to the &quot;Führer&quot;, I&#x27;m staying.&quot;

===KZ Ravensbrück (1939–1942)===
Mandl was transferred to the Ravensbrück concentration camp on 15 May 1939 when she was twenty-seven, where she continued to work under Kögl and Langefeld. Mandl was given Langefeld&#x27;s rank in April 1942 after the latter was found to be ineffective in enforcing &quot;brutality and structure&quot; within the camp. Mandl earned the nickname &quot;the beast&quot; during this period.

Mandl became known among Ravensbrück prisoners for targeting women with curly hair, beating them in the head, kicking them to the ground, or shaving off their curls. Survivor has described in an incident in which Mandl kicked a Jewish woman to death during roll-call—one of the many fatal beatings that took place at the camp.

When Ravensbrück became a center for women to receive training, Mandl took over much of the instruction in the early years of the program. Mandl trained Hermine Braunsteiner, who would become known as the &quot;Mare of Majdanek&quot;, in the summer of 1939. Braunsteiner described Mandl as &quot;very strict&quot; and &quot;unfavorable&quot;, referring to how she witnessed her hitting the prisoners.

Mandl had a brief relationship with while at Ravensbrück, which ended when Bräuning became involved romantically with another woman. This increased the number of prisoners shot and punished by Mandl.

===KZ Auschwitz II-Birkenau (1942–1945)===
In October 1942, Mandl was assigned to Auschwitz II-Birkenau, where she succeeded Langefeld in rank after being promoted from to . Mandl worked under Rudolf Höss, who was the only SS man she had to report to. Höss regarded her highly, and on 27 March 1944, arranged for her to receive a one-hundred Reichsmark bonus in addition to her monthly pay. Mandl was also given command of all the female Auschwitz camps and subcamps, including Hindenburg O.S., Lichtewerden, and Raisko.

Mandl promoted Irma Grese to head of the Hungarian women&#x27;s camp at Birkenau and appointed Therese Brandl as her private secretary. According to survivor Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, Mandl would often stand at the gate into Birkenau, waiting for an inmate to turn and look at her; those who did were taken out of the lines and never heard from again. Mandl took part in death selections and other atrocities at Auschwitz for the next two years. She signed inmate lists, sending thousands of women and children to their deaths in the gas chambers at Auschwitz I and II. Regina Lebensfeldová-Hofstädterová, a typist in Auschwitz&#x27;s Political Department, stated in her testimony that Mandl called prisoners (dung bees).

In April 1943, Mandl and &quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; Franz Hössler formed the Women&#x27;s Orchestra of Auschwitz to accompany roll calls, executions, selections, and transports. Mandl personally selected the first conductor, Polish music teacher Zofia Czajkowska, and later arranged for an accomplished Austrian violinist named Alma Rosé to be transferred into Auschwitz so that she could lead the women’s orchestra. According to historian David M. Crowe, Mandl &quot;blended a passion for classical music with extreme cruelty towards her female prisoners&quot;.

In November 1944, Mandl was awarded the War Merit Cross, Second Class. Around this time, she was assigned to the Mühldorf subcamp of the Dachau concentration camp, and Elisabeth Volkenrath was appointed head of Auschwitz, which was liberated in late January 1945.

==Arrest, the Auschwitz trial, and execution==
In May 1945, Mandl fled from Mühldorf into the southern Bavarian mountains to return to Münzkirchen, but her father refused to assist her in hiding. Mandl then sought refuge with her sister in Łuck, Ukraine. However, Mandl was arrested by the United States Army on 8 October 1945. Mandl spent some time in a cell in the former Dachau concentration camp. She was filmed by U.S. soldiers on 14 May 1946, while sharing a cell with Elisabeth Ruppert. Interrogations allegedly revealed her to be highly intelligent and dedicated to her work in the camps. 

On 11 November 1946, at their request, U.S. officials transferred Mandl to Polish custody and placed her in Montelupich Prison. On 22 December 1947, Mandl was tried by Poland&#x27;s Supreme National Tribunal in the Auschwitz trial, found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to death by hanging. It is estimated that she was complicit in the murders of 500,000 people.

, a Polish survivor of Auschwitz who was an inmate under Mandl&#x27;s administration and was arrested by Poland&#x27;s post-war communist authorities as a &quot;anti-communist activist&quot;, was imprisoned in the cell next to Mandl and Therese Brandl. Rachwałowa was proficient enough in German to interpret for the wardens. She stated that the last time she saw the two German war criminals, after they had been sentenced to death and shortly before their executions took place, they both asked her for forgiveness.

Mandl was hanged on 24 January 1948 at 7:32 A.M., at the age of thirty-six. Her final words, spoken in Polish, were: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Poland lives&quot;).

<text>In sailing, a cunningham or cunningham&#x27;s eye is a type of downhaul used on a Bermuda rigged sailboat to change the shape of a sail. It is named after its inventor, Briggs Cunningham, a victorious America&#x27;s Cup skipper and yacht builder.

The cunningham differs from a typical downhaul in the way that it attaches to the sail. The system usually consists of a line which is secured at one end to the mast or boom below the foot of the mainsail. It is then passed through a cringle in the luff of the sail near the foot but above the tack, and then led down on the other side to a fitting on the mast, boom or on deck.

The tension in the luff of the sail is adjusted using a combination of the halyard and the cunningham (where fitted). The primary advantage of adjusting the cunningham is the speed and ease with which the luff tension can be changed while sailing or racing. By either hauling or easing the line, the tension in the luff can be changed, thereby shifting the point of maximum draft of the sail forward or aft respectively, optimizing sail shape and thus performance. It is a fine control which is used more frequently on racing sailboats than on cruising or day-sailing boats.
