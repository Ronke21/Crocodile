<doc id="484631" wikidata="Q1134560" url="?curid=484631" title="Tukwila (processor)">
<text>The Itanium 9300 series, code-named Tukwila, is the generation of Intel&#x27;s Itanium processor family following Itanium 2 and Montecito. It was released on 8 February 2010. It utilizes both multiple processor cores (multi-core) and SMT techniques. The engineers said to be working on this project were from the DEC Alpha project, specifically those who worked on the Alpha 21464 (EV8), which was focused on SMT.

Named for the city of Tukwila, Washington, Tukwila was previously code-named &quot;Tanglewood&quot;. The original name is also used by the Tanglewood music festival, and Intel renamed the project in late 2003.

The processor has two to four cores per die and up to 24 MB L3 of on-die cache.
They are the first batch of processors to contain more than 2 billion transistors on a single die. This total is made up as follows:

* core logic — 430 million
* system interface — 157 million
* L3 cache — 1,420 million
* I/O logic — 39 million
* chip total — 2.046 billion

Die size is 21.5×32.5 mm or 698.75 mm2.

==Xeon compatibility==
It was originally stated that Tukwila and its associated chipset would bring socket compatibility between Intel&#x27;s Xeon and Itanium processors, by introducing a new interconnect called Intel QuickPath Interconnect (QuickPath, previously known as Common System Interface or CSI). This ultimate endeavor would help reduce product development costs for both Intel and its partners, by allowing for greater reuse of components and manufacturing processes. Tukwila is reported to have four &quot;full&quot; QuickPath links and two &quot;half&quot; links.

Whitefield, the first Xeon processor to feature QuickPath, suffered significant project delays and was cancelled. The first Xeon MP processor to feature QuickPath is Beckton.

The released Itanium 9300-series processors are using a separate socket, LGA 1248, which is incompatible with Xeon processors and motherboards.

==Comparison table==
==Successor==
The successor is code-named &quot;Poulson&quot;. It was initially slated for a Q4 2009 release and said to have over four cores, most likely eight.

In 2009 an Intel representative stated that Intel would maintain a two-year development cycle for Itanium, implying Poulson would be released in Q1 2012.

<text>Ablon () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France.

==Geography==
Ablon is 5 km south east of Honfleur and 16 km north-west of Pont-Audemer with its northern border on the Seine Estuary. It can be reached on Highway D580A from Honfleur turning right on the small country road called &quot;Cote de Vats&quot; to reach the village of Ablon. Road D140 (Route de Genneville) from Genneville in the south passes through the western side of the commune to join the D580a just outside the commune. The D144 road forms the southern border of the commune. Ablon is in the north-eastern corner of the Calvados department with its eastern border being the departmental border with Eure.

The &quot;Morelle&quot; river passes through the north of the commune from east to west although oddly does not form part of the commune. The &quot;Canal de Retour&quot; is parallel to it but also does not form part of the commune.

==Toponymy==
The name of the village is attested as far back as 1180 as Abelon.

One theory states that the town&#x27;s name comes from the Norse &quot;Epi-lundr&quot;, meaning “apple orchard”. The nearby village of Yébleron shares this etymology. The ancient scandinavian &quot;lundr&quot; meaning orchard or wood has regularly been followed by the suffix -lon (for example, Bouquelon, Écaquelon, Yquelon, etc.).

Another theory suggests that the town&#x27;s name derives from the Germanic personal name Abilo, followed by the suffix -o/-one, but this suffix does not usually accompany Germanic personal names. It has also been suggested that the name is based solely on the name ‘Abilo&#x27; with no suffix but the usage of a personal name with no suffix or epithet would be exceptional among Norman place names.

A third theory suggests that Ablon comes from the Germanic personal name Abbo followed by the suffix -lon. If this is the case the name of the town means “Abbo&#x27;s wood”.

The similarity with the nearby village of Ablon-sur-Seine is coincidental.

==History==
In 1809, Ablon grew in size following its union with two neighbouring communes: Crémanville and Ableville.

Ablon was the site of a Nobel dynamite factory from 1879 until 1989. The factory ceased operations following an explosion on 3 March 1988 which killed 5, including the factory&#x27;s director, and left 8 injured. Windows were broken more than a kilometre away in the village of Honfleur.

==Administration==

List of Successive Mayors of Ablon
==Population==
The inhabitants of the commune are known as &quot;Ablonnais&quot; or &quot;Ablonnaises&quot; in French.

==Culture and heritage==

===Civil heritage===
The commune has two buildings that are registered as historical monuments:
*The Chateau of Ablon (1767 and 1845)
*The Dynamite Factory (1885 to 1916). The factory contains several items that are registered as historical objects:
**A Dreiswerke moulding machine (1952)
**A Weighing machine (20th century)

<text>Polka Dot Shorts is a Canadian children&#x27;s television series produced and broadcast by TVOntario from 1994 to 2001. It was created, produced, and edited by Jed MacKay.

Approximately 180 episodes were produced, all directed by Michael McNamara.

==About==
The series is based on &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot;, and stars the characters Polkaroo, Humpty, Dumpty, Bear and Marigold. The characters are portrayed by &quot;physical theatre&quot; actors in large costumes; Marigold&#x27;s performer, for example, had a ballet and circus background. Unlike in &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot;, in which Polkaroo only ever vocalized his own name, in &quot;Polka Dot Shorts&quot; he spoke full dialogue in English.

The show&#x27;s original concept had been to retain the characters while &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot; underwent a temporary production hiatus, although ultimately &quot;Polka Dot Shorts&quot; continued and the original &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot; did not resume production.

Originally, each episode started with a human host (Deborah Drakeford) introducing the episode to a gathering of children as she was about to read the story from a book. The stories themselves were dramatized by actors in large suits, playing the puppets from &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot;, while the reader provided the dialogue. A new character was added to the &quot;Polka Dot Door family&quot;: Polkaroo&#x27;s pet, Bibble. Although Bibble was only capable of making sounds that loosely resembled &quot;bibblebibblebibble&quot;, he did so in various tones which indicated his mood.

At one point in every episode, one or more of the characters would discover a large pair of polka dot shorts, and exclaim, &quot;A great big pair of polka dot shorts! How did they get there?&quot; Polkaroo&#x27;s response would be, &quot;I haven&#x27;t the foggiest idea!&quot; Some episodes were done entirely in rhyme, in which case the character who found the polka dot shorts would exclaim, &quot;Polka dot shorts, a great big pair! How on earth did they get there?&quot;

After the first two seasons the episodes were re-edited. The human hostess/storyteller was removed, and the show would begin immediately.

The series won a Gemini Award for Best Pre-School Program or Series at the 15th Gemini Awards in 2000, and Charles P. Schott (&quot;Bear&quot;) was a Gemini Award finalist for Best Performer in a Pre-School Series at the 17th Gemini Awards in 2002.

==Characters==
Polkaroo (played by Greg Lanthier, voiced by Andrew Sabiston): A green kangaroo-like animal with yellow hair, a red nose, a long yellow furry tail, a red-and-yellow polka dot on his neck and a gown covered in polka dots. He appears in every episode. He lives in a small house with his pet Bibble. He enjoys having his friends round to play and is mostly the one who finds the polka dot shorts. He sometimes talks in rhyme, and when his friends argue or do something he doesn&#x27;t like, he often interrupts them with &quot;Excuse me&quot;.

Bibble: Polkaroo&#x27;s mischievous pet which looks like a multi-coloured mop head covered in pom-poms. Often seen moving about making a &quot;bibbly&quot; sound, hence his name. He likes to pull pranks, and sometimes annoys the others with them.

Humpty (played by Line Roberge, voiced by Tony Daniels): A big green egg with purplish hair and a white nose. He wears a burgundy coloured suit patterned with pink roses, a tie with a large H on it, and green boots. Humpty is playful and sometimes a bit mischievous, but he always goes out of his way to help his friends. When the gang start to feel scared or nervous, he often says &quot;Pull yourself together.&quot; He is Dumpty&#x27;s older brother.

Dumpty (played by Brunella Battista, voiced by Julie Lemieux): Humpty&#x27;s younger brother. He is brown coloured with a blue checked nose. He wears a cream-coloured cap with the letter D on it, a blue bow tie, a blue suit with flowers and checks on it, and brown boots. The youngest of the group, he loves to help and wants to fit in. He sometimes annoys his older brother Humpty, but deeply cares for him.

Bear (played by Charles P. Schott, voiced by Brian Moffatt): A brown bear who is Polkaroo&#x27;s best friend and wears a green bow tie with white polka dots. He has a great fondness for honey, speaks with a posh accent, and can sometimes be a bit of a show-off. He often says &quot;Coincidence, I think not.&quot;

Marigold (played by Alisa Walton, voiced by Deborah Drakeford): A kind-hearted doll with orange yarn-like hair in pigtails. She wears a green dress with flowers on it, yellow-and-white striped leggings, and black buckle shoes. She loves gardening and grows many different plants. She often says &quot;You know what? I&#x27;ll tell you what.&quot;

<doc id="484650" wikidata="Q1004354" url="?curid=484650" title="Functional neuroimaging">
<text>Functional neuroimaging is the use of neuroimaging technology to measure an aspect of brain function, often with a view to understanding the relationship between activity in certain brain areas and specific mental functions. It is primarily used as a research tool in cognitive neuroscience, cognitive psychology, neuropsychology, and social neuroscience.

== Overview ==
Common methods of functional neuroimaging include
* Positron emission tomography (PET)
* Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
* Electroencephalography (EEG)
* Magnetoencephalography (MEG)
* Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
* Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)
* Functional ultrasound imaging (fUS)

PET, fMRI, fNIRS and fUS can measure localized changes in cerebral blood flow related to neural activity. These changes are referred to as &quot;activations&quot;. Regions of the brain which are activated when a subject performs a particular task may play a role in the neural computations which contribute to the behaviour. For instance, widespread activation of the occipital lobe is typically seen in tasks which involve visual stimulation (compared with tasks that do not). This part of the brain receives signals from the retina and is believed to play a role in visual perception.

Other methods of neuroimaging involve recording of electrical currents or magnetic fields, for example EEG and MEG. Different methods have different advantages for research; for instance, MEG measures brain activity with high temporal resolution (down to the millisecond level), but is limited in its ability to localize that activity. fMRI does a much better job of localizing brain activity for spatial resolution, but with a much lower time resolution while functional ultrasound (fUS) can reach an interesting spatio-temporal resolution (down to 100 micrometer, 100 milliseconds, at 15 MHz in preclinical models) but is also limited by the neurovascular coupling.

Recently, Magnetic particle imaging has been proposed as a new sensitive imaging technique that has sufficient temporal resolution for functional neuroimaging based on the increase of cerebral blood volume. First pre-clinical trials have successfully demonstrated functional imaging in rodents.

== Functional neuroimaging topics ==
The measure used in a particular study is generally related to the particular question being addressed. Measurement limitations vary amongst the techniques. For instance, MEG and EEG record the magnetic or electrical fluctuations that occur when a population of neurons is active. These methods are excellent for measuring the time-course of neural events (on the order of milliseconds,) but generally bad at measuring where those events happen. PET and fMRI measure changes in the composition of blood near a neural event. Because measurable blood changes are slow (on the order of seconds), these methods are much worse at measuring the time-course of neural events, but are generally better at measuring the location.

Traditional &quot;activation studies&quot; focus on determining distributed patterns of brain activity associated with specific tasks. However, scientists are able to more thoroughly understand brain function by studying the interaction of distinct brain regions, as a great deal of neural processing is performed by an integrated network of several regions of the brain. An active area of neuroimaging research involves examining the functional connectivity of spatially remote brain regions. Functional connectivity analyses allow the characterization of interregional neural interactions during particular cognitive or motor tasks or merely from spontaneous activity during rest. FMRI and PET enable creation of functional connectivity maps of distinct spatial distributions of temporally correlated brain regions called functional networks. Several studies using neuroimaging techniques have also established that posterior visual areas in blind individuals may be active during the performance of nonvisual tasks such as Braille reading, memory retrieval, and auditory localization as well as other auditory functions.

A direct method to measure functional connectivity is to observe how stimulation of one part of the brain will affect other areas. This can be done noninvasively in humans by combining transcranial magnetic stimulation with one of the neuroimaging tools such as PET, fMRI, or EEG. Massimini et al. (&quot;Science&quot;, September 30, 2005) used EEG to record how activity spreads from the stimulated site. They reported that in non-REM sleep, although the brain responds vigorously to stimulation, functional connectivity is much attenuated from its level during wakefulness. Thus, during deep sleep, &quot;brain areas do not talk to each other&quot;.

Functional neuroimaging draws on data from many areas other than cognitive neuroscience and social neuroscience, including other biological sciences (such as neuroanatomy and neurophysiology), physics and maths, to further develop and refine the technology.

== Critique and careful interpretation ==
Functional neuroimaging studies have to be carefully designed and interpreted with care.
Statistical analysis (often using a technique called statistical parametric mapping) is often needed so that the different sources of activation within the brain can be distinguished from one another.
This can be particularly challenging when considering processes which are difficult to conceptualise or have no easily definable task associated with them (for example belief and consciousness).

Functional neuroimaging of interesting phenomena often gets cited in the press.
In one case a group of prominent functional neuroimaging researchers felt compelled to write a letter to New York Times in response to an op-ed article about a study of so-called neuropolitics. They argued that some of the interpretations of the study were &quot;scientifically unfounded&quot;.

The Hastings Center issued a report in March 2014 entitled &quot;Interpreting Neuroimages: An Introduction to the Technology and Its Limits&quot;, with articles by leading neuroscientists and bioethicists. The report briefly explains neuroimaging technologies and mostly critiques, but also somewhat defends, their current state, import and prospects.

<text>Hydro-Québec () is a Canadian Crown corporation public utility headquartered in Montreal, Quebec. It manages the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in Quebec, as well as the export of power to portions of the Northeast United States. More than 40 percent of Canada’s water resources are in Quebec and Hydro-Québec is among the largest hydropower producer in the world.

It was established as a Crown corporation by the government of Quebec in 1944 from the expropriation of private firms. This was followed by massive investment in hydro-electric projects like the James Bay Project. Today, with 63 hydroelectric power stations, the combined output capacity is 37,370 megawatts. Extra power is exported from the province and Hydro-Québec supplies 10 per cent of New England&#x27;s power requirements. The company logo, a stylized &quot;Q&quot; fashioned out of a circle and a lightning bolt, was designed by Montreal-based design agency Gagnon/Valkus in 1960.

In 2023, it paid 2.47 billion in dividends to its sole shareholder, the Government of Quebec. Its residential power rates are among the lowest in North America.

== History ==

===1945–1959: beginnings and development===
In Quebec, advocates for the creation of a public hydroelectric utility protested against high costs, poor rural electrification, and the lack of French speakers in management positions in hydroelectricity companies. In 1944, Montreal Light, Heat &amp; Power company was nationalised, along with its subsidiary, Beauharnois Power, and Hydro-Québec was created to manage the companies.

Quebec Premier Adélard Godbout adopted a policy of investing 10 million dollars per year in rural electrification. However, in 1944 the government changed, and the new premier Maurice Duplessis was opposed to any form of government intervention in the economy. Local cooperatives were created to bring power to rural areas.
Duplessis remained in power until 1960, and during that time there were no further nationalisations of companies, and Hydro-Québec mostly served the Montreal area.

Major projects included:
* Bersimis-1 generating station completed in 1956, 1,125 MW
* Bersimis-2 generating station completed in 1959, 845 MW
* Beauharnois Hydroelectric Generating Station completed in 1961, 1,903 MW.
* Carillon Generating Station built 1959–1964, 752 MW

Between 1944 and 1962, Hydro-Québec&#x27;s installed capacity increased from 616 to 3,661 MW while lowering residential power rates by half in the Montreal area.

===1960–1979: the second nationalization===

Duplessis&#x27;s conservative reign, now known as the Grande Noirceur, ended when he died in office in 1959. The subsequent election of the Quebec Liberal Party, led by Jean Lesage, marked the beginning of the Quiet Revolution, a period of reform and modernization. In 1962, the US government lent Quebec $300 million. The funds were used to acquire independent power companies. The new government gave Hydro-Québec an exclusive mandate to develop new sites. In 1963 the government authorized it to acquire private electricity distributors, including the Gatineau Power Company and the Shawinigan Water &amp; Power Company Hydro-Québec achieved province-wide scope. All of the 46 rural coops accepted Hydro-Québec&#x27;s 1963 buyout offer, except Saint-Jean-Baptiste-de-Rouville which still exists. In 1964, the Province of British Columbia provided the Province of Quebec with a $100 million loan. $60 million from that loan went to Hydro-Québec. The loan faced controversy in the Quebec legislature. Major projects during this period included:
* Manicougan-Outardes Project, a 7-dam hydroelectric complex including the Jean-Lesage generating station (1,145 MW), René-Lévesque generating station (1,244 MW), and the Daniel-Johnson Dam (2,596 MW), originally named Manic-2, Manic-3, and Manic-5 respectively. Because these stations were 700 kilometres (400 miles) away from the urban centres in southern Quebec, through transmission line voltage was stepped up to for the first time anywhere, led by engineer Jean-Jacques Archambault.
* Churchill Falls Generating Station, 5,428 MW. The station is in Labrador and the government of Quebec negotiated a contract where Hydro-Québec buys power from the project at 1969 prices until the year 2041. That contract had been a source of conflict between the two provinces.In December 2024, Newfoundland premier Andrew Furey and Quebec premier François Legault signed a 50-year Memorandum of understanding that terminated the original contract in 2025. If ratified by both provinces, the rates Hydro-Quebec pays for Churchill Falls electricity would rise by 2,850%.
* Phase I of the James Bay Project. 

* Hydro-Québec worked with Atomic Energy of Canada Limited to build the CANDU reactor equipped Gentilly Nuclear Generating Station, which closed in 2012.

=== 1980–1996: restructuring ===
Because of the economic climate, demand for electricity dropped significantly in the early 1980s, which led to structural changes at Hydro-Québec. It became a joint stock company whose sole shareholder is Government of Québec, to which it pays an annual dividend. It was also given the mandate to export power and to work in any energy-related field.

In 1986 the Quebec – New England Transmission began bringing power from the James Bay Project 1,100 kilometers (700 miles) south to the Boston area.

Phase II of the James Bay Project started in 1987 and took nine years to complete. Construction of the Denis-Perron Dam began in 1994.

=== 1997–present: renewed growth ===
Like its counterparts in the North American utility industry, Hydro-Québec was reorganized in the late 1990s to comply with electricity deregulation in the United States. The transmission division, TransÉnergie, was the first to be spun off in 1997, in response to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission&#x27;s publication of Order 888. In the same year, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted Hydro-Québec a licence to sell wholesale electricity at market prices, enabling Hydro-Québec to expand its market. Hydro-Québec also acquired a substantial share of Noverco, controller of natural gas distributor Énergir, to participate in that market in northeastern North America.In 2002 the Agreement Respecting a New Relationship Between the Cree Nation and the Government of Quebec between the Grand Council of the Crees and the Quebec government made possible the development of the Eastmain Reservoir. The Eastmain-1-A and Sarcelle powerhouses and Rupert River diversion project were completed for $5,000 million CAD. This will provide water power to the turbines at Eastmain-1, Eastmain-1-A and Sarcelle powerhouses and will provide increased flow at the existing La Grande-1 generating station as well as Robert-Bourassa and the La Grande-2-A generator stations. Output will be 918 MW.

Other stations commissioned since 1997 are:
* Sainte-Marguerite-3 in 2003, 882 MW.
* Péribonka in 2008, 385 MW.
* Rocher-de-Grand-Mère in 2004, 230 MW.
* Eastmain-1in 2007, 480 MW
* Rapide-des-Cœurs in 2009, 76 MW.
* Chute-Allard in 2009, 62 MW
* Mercier in 2009, 55 MW.
* Bernard-Landry in 2012, 768 MW
* La Sarcelle in 2013, 150 MW.
* Romaine-2 in 2014, 640 MW.
* Romaine-1 in 2015, 270 MW.
* Romaine-3 in 2017, 395 MW.
* Romaine-4 in 2022, 245 MW.

=== Major outages ===
In 1988, all of Quebec and parts of New England and New Brunswick lost power because of an equipment failure at a substation on the North Shore. The March 1989 geomagnetic storm tripped circuit breakers on the transmission network causing a nine-hour Quebec-wide blackout.

In the North American ice storm of 1998, five days of freezing rain collapsed of high voltage power lines and over of medium and low voltage distribution lines in southern Quebec. Up to 1.4 million customers were without power for up to five weeks.

== Corporate structure and financial results ==

=== Corporate structure ===
Hydro-Québec has created separate business units dealing with the generation, transmission, distribution and construction. In 2017, production division generated 1.9B $ of net income (68.4%), transmission division 0.55B$ (19.4%), distribution division 0.33B $ (11.7%), and construction division did not generate any income. Hydro-Quebec redistributes all profits back to the government. In 2017, the crown corporation contributed $4 billion to the Quebec government by means of net income ($2.8B), royalties ($0.7B), public utilities tax ($0.3B) and debt securities ($0.2B).

In the year 2000 with the adoption of Bill 116, which amended the &quot;Act respecting the Régie de l&#x27;énergie&quot;, to enact the functional separation of Hydro-Québec&#x27;s various business units. Legislation passed in 2000 commits the generation division, Hydro-Québec Production, to provide the distribution division, Hydro-Québec Distribution, a yearly &quot;heritage pool&quot; of up to 165 TWh of energy plus ancillary services—including an extra 13.9 TWh for losses and a guaranteed peak capacity of 34,342 MW—at a set price of 2.79¢ per kWh. Order in council 1277-2001 specifies quantities to be delivered for each of the 8,760 hourly intervals, which vary from 11,420 to 34,342 MW.

According to the 2017 annual report the workforce stood at 19,786 employees, both permanent and temporary workers. And, a total of 1,304 employees were hired.

=== Privatization debate ===
In 1981, the Parti Québécois government redefined Hydro-Québec&#x27;s mission by modifying the terms of the &quot;social pact&quot; of 1944. The government issued itself 43,741,090 shares worth C$100 each, and the amended statute stated that Hydro-Québec would now pay up to 75% of its net earnings in dividends. This amendment to the &quot;Hydro-Québec Act&quot; started an episodic debate on whether Hydro-Québec should be fully or partially privatized. In recent years, economist Marcel Boyer and businessman Claude Garcia—both associated with the conservative think tank &quot;The Montreal Economic Institute&quot;—have often raised the issue, claiming that the company could be better managed by the private sector and that the proceeds from a sale would lower public debt.

Without going as far as Boyer and Garcia, Mario Dumont, the head of the Action démocratique du Québec, briefly discussed the possibility of selling a minority stake of Hydro-Québec during the 2008 election campaign. A Léger Marketing poll conducted in November 2008 found that a majority of Quebec respondents (53%) were opposed to his proposal to sell 7.5% of the company&#x27;s equity to Quebec citizens and businesses, while 38% were in favour.

Commenting on the issue on Guy A. Lepage&#x27;s talk show, former PQ Premier Jacques Parizeau estimated that such an idea would be quite unpopular in public opinion, adding that Hydro-Québec is often seen by Quebecers as a national success story and a source of pride. This could explain why various privatization proposals in the past have received little public attention. The liberal government has repeatedly stated that Hydro-Québec is not for sale.

Like many other economists, Yvan Allaire, from Montreal&#x27;s Hautes études commerciales business school, advocate increased electricity rates as a way to increase the government&#x27;s annual dividend without resorting to privatization. Others, like columnist Bertrand Tremblay of Saguenay&#x27;s &quot;Le Quotidien&quot;, claim that privatization would signal a drift to the days when Quebec&#x27;s natural resources were sold in bulk to foreigners at ridiculously low prices. &quot;For too long, Tremblay writes, Quebec was somewhat of a banana republic, almost giving away its forestry and water resources. In turn, those foreign interests were exporting our jobs associated with the development of our natural resources with the complicity of local vultures&quot;.

Left-wing academics, such as UQAM&#x27;s Léo-Paul Lauzon and Gabriel Sainte-Marie, have claimed that privatization would be done at the expense of residential customers, who would pay much higher rates. They say that privatization would also be a betrayal of the social pact between the people and its government, and that the province would be short-selling itself by divesting of a choice asset for a minimal short term gain.

== Activities ==

=== Power generation ===

On December 31, 2013, Hydro-Québec Production owned and operated 61 hydro plants —including 12 of over 1,000 MW capacity — with 26 major reservoirs. These facilities are located in 13 of Quebec&#x27;s 430 watersheds, including the Saint Lawrence, Betsiamites, La Grande, Manicouagan, Ottawa, Outardes, and Saint-Maurice rivers. These plants provide the bulk of electricity generated and sold by the company.

Non-hydro plants included the baseload 675-MW gross Gentilly nuclear generating station, a CANDU-design reactor which was permanently shut down on December 28, 2012 the 660-MW Tracy Thermal Generating Station, a heavy fuel oil-fired plant shutdown in March 2011 and two gas turbine peaker plants, for a total installed capacity of 36,971 MW in 2011. Hydro-Québec&#x27;s average generation cost was 2.11 cents per kWh in 2011.

The company also purchases the bulk of the output of the 5,428-MW Churchill Falls generating station in Labrador, under a long-term contract expiring in 2025. In 2009, Hydro-Québec bought the 60% stake owned by AbitibiBowater in the McCormick plant (335 MW), located at the mouth of the Manicouagan River near Baie-Comeau, for C$616 million.

In 2023, the energy sold by Hydro-Québec to its grid-connected customers in Quebec and exported to neighboring markets came almost exclusively from renewable sources. Hydro (98.53%) is by far the largest source, followed by wind (0.11%) and biomass, biogas and waste (0.01%). In 2013, emissions of carbon dioxide (1,130 tonnes/TWh), sulfur dioxide (4 tonnes/TWh) and nitrogen oxides (10 tonnes/TWh) were between 49 and 238 times lower than the industry average in northeastern North America. Imported electricity bought on the markets account for most of these emissions.
===Transmission system===
Hydro-Québec&#x27;s expertise at building and operating a very high voltage electrical grid spreading over long distances has long been recognized in the electrical industry. TransÉnergie, Hydro-Québec&#x27;s transmission division, operates the largest electricity transmission network in North America. It acts as the independent system operator and reliability coordinator for the Québec interconnection of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation system, and is part of the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC). TransÉnergie manages the flow of energy on the Quebec network and ensures non-discriminatory access to all participants involved in the wholesale market. The non-discriminatory access policy allows a company such as Nalcor to sell some of its share of power from Churchill Falls on the open market in the State of New York using TransÉnergie&#x27;s network, upon payment of a transmission fee.

In recent years, TransÉnergie&#x27;s &quot;Contrôle des mouvements d&#x27;énergie&quot; (CMÉ) unit has been acting as the reliability coordinator of the bulk electricity network for Quebec as a whole, under a bilateral agreement between the Régie de l&#x27;énergie du Québec and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission of the United States.

TransÉnergie&#x27;s high voltage network stretches over , including of , and a network of 514 substations. It is connected to neighbouring Canadian provinces and the United States by 17 ties, with a maximum reception capacity of 10,850 MW and a maximum transmission capacity of 7,994 MW.

==== Interconnections ====

The TransÉnergie&#x27;s network operates asynchronously from that of its neighbours on the Eastern Interconnection. Although Quebec uses the same 60 hertz frequency as the rest of North America, its grid does not use the same phase as surrounding networks. TransÉnergie mainly relies on back to back HVDC converters to export or import electricity from other jurisdictions.

This feature of the Quebec network allowed Hydro-Québec to remain unscathed during the Northeast Blackout of August 14, 2003, with the exception of 5 hydro plants on the Ottawa River radially connected to the Ontario grid at the time. A new 1250-MW back to back HVDC tie has been commissioned at the Outaouais substation, in L&#x27;Ange-Gardien, near the Ontario border. The new interconnection has been online since 2009 and the 315 kV line is fully operational since 2010.

One drawback of the TransÉnergie network involves the long distances separating the generation sites and the main consumer markets. For instance, the Radisson substation links the James Bay project plants to the Nicolet station near Sainte-Eulalie, south of the Saint Lawrence, over away.

==== Investments ====
In 2011, TransÉnergie invested C$1.3 billion in capital expenditures, including C$460 million to expand its network.

In addition to the new tie with Ontario, the company plans to build a new 1200-MW direct current link between the Des Cantons substation at Windsor, Quebec in Quebec&#x27;s Eastern Townships and Deerfield, New Hampshire, with an HVDC converter terminal built at Franklin, New Hampshire. The US segment of the US$1.1 billion line, would be built by &quot;Northern Pass Transmission LLC&quot;, a partnership between Northeast Utilities (75%) and NSTAR (25%). In order to go ahead, the project must receive regulatory approval in Quebec and the United States. The proposed transmission line could be in operation in 2015. According to Jim Robb, a senior executive from Northeast Utilities, New England could meet one third of its Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative commitments with the hydropower coming through this new power line alone.

=== Distribution ===
Hydro-Québec Distribution is in charge of retail sales to most customers in Quebec. It operates a network of of medium and low voltage lines. The division is the sole electric distributor across the province, with the exception of 9 municipal distribution networks — in Alma, Amos, Baie-Comeau, Coaticook, Joliette, Magog, Saguenay, Sherbrooke and Westmount—and the electric cooperative of Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Rouville.

Hydro-Québec Distribution buys most of its power from the 165-TWh &quot;heritage pool&quot; provided by Hydro-Québec Production at 2.79¢/kWh. The division usually purchases additional power by entering into long-term contracts after a public call for tenders. For shorter term needs, it also buys power from the neighboring systems at market prices. As a last resort, Hydro-Québec Production can also provide short-term relief. Supply contracts above and beyond the heritage pool must be approved by the &quot;Régie de l&#x27;énergie du Québec&quot; and their costs are passed on to customers.

The division signed one natural gas cogeneration agreement for 507 MW in 2003, three forest biomass deals (47.5 MW) in 2004 and 2005, and ten contracts for wind power (2,994 MW) in 2005 and 2008, all with private sector producers. It also signed two flexible contracts with Hydro-Québec Production (600 MW) in 2002.

Hydro-Québec Distribution is also responsible for the production of power in remote communities not connected to the main power grid. The division operates an off-grid hydroelectric dam serving communities on the Lower North Shore and 23 small diesel power plants in the Magdalen Islands, in Haute-Mauricie and in Nunavik.

=== Other activities ===

==== Electric Circuit network ====

In April 2011 the government of Quebec published a plan to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles, setting a target of 25% of cars sold in 2020 to be electric. The plan also called for provincial utility company Hydro-Quebec to develop a strategy for the deployment of public charging infrastructure. This resulted in the creation of &quot;The Electric Circuit&quot; (), the largest public network of charging stations for electric vehicles in Quebec. The first 30 charging stations were put into use in March 2012. The network&#x27;s first 400V fast charger was installed in 2013.

As of 2023, The Electric Circuit offers almost 3,500 public charging stations in Quebec and eastern Ontario. Usage is also compatible with the FLO and New Brunswick E-charge network adaptors.

==== Research and development ====


Hydro-Québec has made significant investments in research and development over the past 40 years. In addition to funding university research, the company is the only electric utility in North America to operate its own large-scale research institute, L&#x27;Institut de recherche d&#x27;Hydro-Québec (IREQ). Established by Lionel Boulet in 1967, the research centre is located in Varennes, a suburb on the South Shore of Montreal. IREQ operates on an annual research budget of approximately C$100 million and specializes in the areas of high voltage, mechanics and thermomechanics, network simulations and calibration.

Research conducted by scientists and engineers at IREQ has helped to extend the life of dams, improve water turbine performance, automate network management and increase the transmission capacity of high voltage power lines.

Another research centre, the &quot;Laboratoire des technologies de l&#x27;énergie&quot; (LTE) in Shawinigan, was opened in 1988 to adapt and develop new products while helping industrial customers improve their energy efficiency.

In the last 20 years, the institute has also conducted research and development work towards the electrification of ground transportation. Current projects include battery materials, including innovative work on lithium iron phosphate and nano-titanate, improved electric drive trains and the effects of the large-scale deployment of electric vehicles on the power grid. Projects focus on technologies to increase range, improve performance in cold weather and reduce charging time.

Hydro-Québec has been criticized for not having taken advantage of some of its innovations. An electric wheel motor concept that struck a chord with Quebecers, first prototyped in 1994 by Pierre Couture, an engineer and physicist working at IREQ, is one of these. The heir to the Couture wheel motor is now marketed by TM4 Electrodynamic Systems, a spin-off established in 1998 that has made deals with France&#x27;s Dassault and Heuliez to develop an electric car, the Cleanova, of which prototypes were built in 2006. Hydro-Québec announced in early 2009 at the Montreal International Auto Show that its engine had been chosen by Tata Motors to equip a demonstration version of its Indica model, which will be road tested in Norway.

==== Construction ====
The Hydro-Québec Équipement division acts as the company&#x27;s main contractor on major construction sites, with the exception of work conducted on the territory covered by the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement, which are assigned to the Société d&#x27;énergie de la Baie James subsidiary.

The construction of a complex of four hydroelectric generating stations on the Romaine River () began on May 13, 2009. The plants have been completed as of 2022 and have added a total of 1 550 MW of power.

In his March 2009 inaugural speech, Quebec Premier Jean Charest announced that his government intends to further develop the province&#x27;s hydroelectric potential. The call for further development of hydroelectric and other renewable generating capacity has been implemented in the company&#x27;s 2009-2013 strategic plan, released on July 30, 2009. Hydro-Québec plans capacity upgrades at the Jean-Lesage (120 MW) and René-Lévesque (210 MW) stations and a third unit at the SM-3 plant (440 MW). The company will also conduct technical and environmental studies and undertake consultations with local communities to build new facilities on the Little Mecatina (1,200 MW) and Magpie (850 MW) rivers on the North Shore, and revive the Tabaret project (132 MW) in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, in western Quebec.

====International ventures====
Hydro-Québec first forays outside its borders began in 1978. A new subsidiary, Hydro-Québec International, was created to market the company&#x27;s know-how abroad in the fields of distribution, generation and transmission of electricity. The new venture leveraged the existing pool of expertise in the parent company.

During the next 25 years, Hydro-Québec was particularly active abroad with investments in electricity transmission networks and generation: Transelec in Chile, the Cross Sound Cable in the United States, the Consorcio Transmantaro in Peru, Hidroelectrica Rio Lajas in Costa Rica, Murraylink in Australia and the Fortuna generating station in Panama.

It briefly held a 17% share in SENELEC, Senegal&#x27;s electric utility, when the Senegalese government decided to sell part of the company to a consortium led by the French company Elyo, a subsidiary of Group Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux, in 1999. The transaction was canceled in 2000 following the election of president Abdoulaye Wade.

Also in 1999, Hydro-Québec International acquired a 20% stake in the Meiya Power Company in China for C$83 million. The company held this participation until July 2004. The company&#x27;s expertise was sought by several hydroelectric developers throughout the world, including the Three Gorges Dam, where Hydro&#x27;s employees trained Chinese engineers in the fields of management, finance and dams.

Hydro-Québec gradually withdrew from the international business between 2003 and 2006, and sold off all of its foreign investments for a profit. Proceeds from these sales were paid to the government&#x27;s Generations Fund, a trust fund set up by the province to alleviate the effect of public debt on future generations.

In 2022, Hydro-Québec, through its US Subsidiary HQI US Holding, acquired Great River Hydro, LLC. for the sum of US$2.2 billion.

== Environment ==
The construction and operation of electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities has environmental effects and Hydro-Québec&#x27;s activities are no exception. Hydroelectric development affects the natural environment where facilities are built and on the people living in the area. For instance, the development of new reservoirs increases the level of mercury in lakes and rivers, which works up the food chain. It temporarily increases the emission of greenhouse gases from reservoirs and contributes to shoreline erosion.

In addition, hydroelectric facilities transform the human environment. They create new obstacles to navigation, flood traditional hunting and trapping grounds, force people to change their eating habits due to the elevated mercury content of some species of fish, destroy invaluable artifacts that would help trace the human presence on the territory, and disrupt the society and culture of Aboriginal people living near the facilities.

Since the early 1970s, Hydro-Québec has been aware of the environmental externalities of its operations. The adoption of a Quebec statute on environmental quality in 1972, the cancellation of Champigny Project, a planned pumped storage plant in the Jacques-Cartier River valley in 1973, and the James Bay negotiations leading to the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement in 1975, forced the company to reconsider its practices.

To address environmental concerns, Hydro-Québec established an environmental protection committee in 1970 and an Environmental Management unit in September 1973. Its mandate is to study and measure the environmental effects of the company, prepare impact assessment, and develop mitigation strategies for new and existing facilities, while conducting research projects in these areas, in cooperation with the scientific community.

=== Effects on the natural environment ===
In the late 1970s, the company set up a network of 27 monitoring stations to measure the effects of the James Bay Project which provide a wealth of data on northern environments. The first 30 years of studies in the James Bay area have confirmed that mercury levels in fish increase by 3 to 6 times over the first 5 to 10 years after the flooding of a reservoir, but then gradually revert to their initial values after 20 to 30 years. These results confirm similar studies conducted elsewhere in Canada, the United States and Finland. Research also found that it is possible to reduce human exposure to mercury even when fish constitutes a significant part of a population&#x27;s diet. Exposure risks can be mitigated without overly reducing the consumption of fish, simply by avoiding certain species and fishing spots.

Despite the fact that the transformation of a terrestrial environment into an aquatic environment constitutes a major change and that flooding leads to the displacement or death of nonmigratory animals, the riparian environments lost through flooding are partially replaced by new ones on the exposed banks of reduced-flow rivers. The biological diversity of reservoir islands is comparable to other islands in the area and the reservoir drawdown zone is used by a variety of wildlife. The population of migratory species of interest such as the caribou have even increased to the point where the hunt has been expanded.

Emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) rise significantly for a few years after reservoir impoundment, and then stabilize after 10 years to a level similar to that of surrounding lakes. Gross GHG emissions of reservoirs in the James Bay area fluctuate around 30,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per TWh of generated power. Hydro-Québec claims its hydroelectric plants release 35 times less GHG than comparable gas-fired plants and 70 times less than coal-fired ones and that they constitute the &quot;option with the best performance&quot; overall.

=== Social effects and sustainable development ===
Another major environmental concern relates to the population of areas affected by hydroelectric development, specifically the Innu of the North Shore and the Cree and Inuit in Northern Quebec. The hydroelectric developments of the last quarter of the 20th century have accelerated the settling process among Aboriginal populations that started in the 1950s. Among the reasons cited for the increased adoption of a sedentary lifestyle among these peoples are the establishment of Aboriginal businesses, the introduction of paid labor, and the flooding of traditional trapping and fishing lands by the new reservoirs, along with the operation of social and education services run by the communities themselves under the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement.

Some native communities, particularly the Crees, have come to a point &quot;where they increasingly resemble the industrialized society of the South&quot;, notes a Hydro-Québec report summarizing the research conducted in the area between 1970 and 2000. The report adds that a similar phenomenon was observed after the construction of roads and hydroelectric plants near isolated communities in northern Canada and Scandinavia. However, growing social problems and rising unemployment have followed the end of the large construction projects in the 1990s. The report concludes that future economic and social development in the area &quot;will largely depend on the desire for cooperation among the various players&quot;.

After the strong rejection of the Suroît project and its subsequent cancellation in November 2004, Hydro-Québec, under the leadership of its new CEO Thierry Vandal, reaffirmed Hydro-Québec&#x27;s commitment towards energy efficiency, hydropower and development of alternative energy. Since then, Hydro-Québec regularly stresses three criteria for any new hydroelectric development undertaken by the company: projects must be cost effective, environmentally acceptable and well received by the communities. Hydro-Québec has also taken part in a series of sustainable development initiatives since the late 1980s. Its approach is based on three principles: economic development, social development and environmental protection. Since 2007 the company adheres to the Global Reporting Initiative, which governs the collection and publication of sustainability performance information. The company employs 250 professionals and managers in the environmental field and has implemented an ISO 14001-certified environmental management system.

Additionally, the Innu Nation filed a $4 billion claim against Hydro-Québec in October 2020 to receive compensation for damages caused by the Churchill Falls Generating Station.

== Rates and customers ==

=== Quebec market ===

At the end of 2010, Hydro-Québec served 4,060,195 customers grouped into three broad categories: residential and farm (D Rate), commercial and institutional (G Rate) and industrial (M and L rates). The &quot;Other&quot; category includes public lighting systems and municipal distribution systems.

About a dozen distribution rates are set annually by the &quot;Régie de l&#x27;énergie&quot; after public hearings. Pricing is based on the cost of delivery, which includes the cost of supply and transmission, depreciation on fixed assets and provisions for the maintenance of facilities, customer growth and a profit margin.

Rates are uniform throughout Quebec and are based on consumer type and volume of consumption. All rates vary in block to mitigate any cross-subsidization effect between residential, commercial and industrial customers.

Hydro-Québec retail rates are among the lowest in North America. After a five-year rate freeze, between May 1, 1998 and January 1, 2004, the &quot;Régie&quot; granted rate increases on 8 occasions between 2004 and 2010 for a total of 18.4%. More recently, the regulator ordered two successive rate rollbacks in 2011 (0.4%) and 2012 (0.5%). However, rates are expected to go up by 3.7% a year from 2014 to 2018 to reflect a gradual increase of heritage pool electricity announced in the 2010 Quebec budget.

==== Residential customers ====
The average consumption of residential and agricultural customers is relatively high, at 16,857 kWh per year in 2011, because of the widespread use of electricity as the main source of space (77%) and water heating (90%). Hydro-Québec estimates that heating accounts for more than one half of the electricity demand in the residential sector.

This preference for electric heating makes electricity demand more unpredictable, but offers some environmental benefits. Despite Quebec&#x27;s very cold climate in winter, greenhouse gases emissions in the residential sector accounted for only 5.5% (4.65 Mt eq.) of all emissions in Quebec in 2006. Emissions from the residential sector in Quebec fell by 30% between 1990 and 2006.

Residential use of electricity fluctuates from one year to another, and is strongly correlated with the weather. Contrary to the trend in neighboring networks, Hydro-Québec&#x27;s system is winter-peaking. A new all-time consumption record was set on January 23, 2013 with a load of . Previous records were established on January 24, 2011 with , on January 16, 2009, with a load of , and on January 15, 2004 when peak reached .
The price of electricity for residences and farms includes a 40.64¢ daily subscription fee, and two price levels depending on consumption. The rates are all-included: power, transmission and distribution costs, but are subject to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the Quebec Sales Tax (QST). As of April 1, 2012, customers pay 5.32¢/kWh for the first 30 daily kWh, while the remainder is sold at 7.51¢/kWh. The average monthly bill for a residential customer was approximately C$100 in 2008.

Electric meter readings are usually conducted every two months and bills are bimonthly. However, the company offers an optional &quot;Equalized Payment Plan&quot; allowing residential customers to pay their annual electricity costs in 12 monthly installments, based on past consumption patterns of the current customer address and the average temperature in that location.

In 2007, Hydro-Québec pulled out of a Canadian government initiative to install smart meters across the province, stating that it would be &quot;too costly to deliver real savings&quot;. Since then, Hydro-Québec organized a 2-year pilot project, involving 2,000 customers in 4 cities, with time of use metering. A report, filed with the &quot;Régie de l&#x27;énergie&quot;, in the summer of 2010 concluded that the effect of marginal cost pricing with three levels of pricing in the winter would lead to minimal load and energy savings. The company intends to gradually phase-in Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) between 2011 and 2017. Early efforts will focus on meter data transfer, connect-disconnect, outage detection and theft reduction.

==== Industrial customers ====

For more than a century, industrial development in Quebec has been stimulated by the abundance of hydroelectric resources. Energy represents a significant expenditure in the pulp and paper and aluminum sectors. two industries with long-standing traditions in Quebec. In 2010, industrial customers purchased 68.4 TWh from Hydro-Québec, representing 40.4% of all electricity sold by the company on the domestic market.
The Quebec government uses low electricity rates to attract new business and consolidate existing jobs. Despite its statutory obligation to sell electric power to every person who so requests, the province has reserved the right to grant large load allocations to companies on a case-by-case basis since 1974. The threshold was set at 175 MW from 1987 to 2006 and was reduced to 50 MW in the government&#x27;s 2006–2015 energy strategy.

Large industrial users pay a lower rate than the domestic and commercial customers, because of lower distribution costs. In 2010, the largest industrial users, the &quot;Rate L&quot; customers, were paying an average of 4.66¢/kWh whereas companies with special contracts paid 3.07¢/kWh.

In 1987, Hydro-Québec and the Quebec government agreed to a series of controversial deals with aluminum giants Alcan and Alcoa. These risk sharing contracts set the price of electricity based on a series of factors, including aluminum world prices and the value of the Canadian dollar Those agreements are gradually being replaced by one based on published rates.

On May 10, 2007, the Quebec government signed an agreement with Alcan. The agreement, which is still in force despite the company&#x27;s merger with Rio Tinto Group, renews the water rights concession on the Saguenay and Peribonka rivers. In exchange, Alcan has agreed to invest in its Quebec facilities and to maintain jobs and its corporate headquarters in Montreal.

On December 19, 2008, Hydro-Québec and Alcoa signed a similar agreement. This agreement, which expires in 2040, maintains the provision of electricity to Alcoa&#x27;s three aluminum smelters in the province, located in Baie-Comeau, Bécancour and Deschambault-Grondines. In addition, the deal will allow Alcoa to modernize the Baie-Comeau plant which will increase its production capacity by 110,000 tonnes a year, to a total of 548,000 tonnes.

Several economists, including Université Laval&#x27;s Jean-Thomas Bernard and Gérard Bélanger, have challenged the government&#x27;s strategy and argue that sales to large industrial customers are very costly to the Quebec economy. In an article published in 2008, the researchers estimate that, under the current regime, a job in a new aluminum smelter or an expansion project costs the province between C$255,357 and C$729,653 a year, when taking into consideration the money that could be made by selling the excess electricity on the New York market.

This argument is disputed by large industrial customers, who point out that data from 2000 to 2006 indicate that electricity exports prices get lower when quantities increase, and vice versa. &quot;We find that the more we export, the less lucrative it gets&quot;, said Luc Boulanger, the head of the association representing Quebec&#x27;s large industrial customers. In his opinion, the high volatility of electricity markets and the transmission infrastructure physical limitations reduce the quantities of electricity that can be exported when prices are higher.

Hydro Quebec gained attention with Bitcoin miners in 2018 after the crackdown on mining in China. The province has an energy surplus equivalent to 10 Terawatt hours per year.

=== Export markets ===

Hydro-Québec sells part of its surplus electricity to neighbouring systems in Canada and the United States under long-term contracts and transactions on the New England, New York and Ontario bulk energy markets. In 2017, net exports revenues were at $1,651 million for a total of 34.4 TWh sent to New England (53%), New York (23%), Ontario (13%) and other (5%).

Although most export sales are now short-term transactions, Hydro-Québec has entered into long-term export contracts in the past. The corporation has 15 interconnections to neighboring markets. In 1990, the company signed a 328-MW deal with a group of 13 electric distributors in Vermont. On March 11, 2010, Vermont&#x27;s two largest utilities, Green Mountain Power and Central Vermont Public Service, entered into a tentative 26-year deal with Hydro-Québec to purchase up to 225 MW of hydro power from 2012 to 2038. The memorandum of understanding provides for a price smoothing mechanism shielding Vermont customers from market price spikes. The deal is contingent upon the enactment designating large hydro as &quot;renewable energy&quot;.

In 2015, Hydro-Quebec and the Ontario Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) signed a 500-MW seasonal capacity sharing agreement. Ontario has increased capacity in the Winter, and shortages in the summer. Quebec has increased capacity in the summer, and shortages in the Winter. Thus, the agreement serves as to achieve a cost-effective solution for both provinces. Furthermore, in 2016 (IESO) and Hydro-Quebec signed a new long-term agreement starting in 2017 until 2023. The deal will send 2TWh per year to Ontario. On the other hand, Quebec should receive capacity from Ontario during Winter&#x27;s peak demand.

== Presidents ==
From 1944 to 1978, management of Hydro-Québec consisted of five commissioners, one of them acting as president.

==Influence of Cross-Border Transmission Research==
In addition to the long-standing focus on large-scale transmission expansion, contemporary research—such as that presented by Gazar &quot;et al.&quot; (2024)—has investigated the causal relationships between cross-border transmission capacity, new hydroelectric generation, and evolving energy demand in the northeastern United States and Canada. Their Bayesian network analysis suggests that increases in Quebec’s hydroelectric capacity historically correlate more strongly with domestic demand and market price signals, rather than simply the availability of expanded transmission corridors. These findings can inform discussions of whether newly proposed U.S.–Canada intertie projects should include upstream reservoir development in environmental impact assessments.

<text>Agy () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region of north-western France.

==Geography==
Agy is located 4 km south-west of Bayeux and 7 km north-east of Balleroy. The D572 highway from Bayeux to Saint-Lô passes through the eastern edges of the commune. The rest of the commune can be reached on the D207 from Campigny in the north-west passing through the village then continuing south-east to join the D572A which is parallel to the D572. Apart from the village there are three hamlets: La Commune, Les Malcadets, and Aprigny all along the D207 road. The rest of the commune is entirely farmland.

The north-east border of the commune is marked by the &quot;Drone&quot; river with the southern border marked by the &quot;Ponche&quot;. In the west is the &quot;Vicalet&quot; stream flowing north and partly forming the western border.

==Toponymy==
The town&#x27;s name is attested in its Latin form &quot;Ageyum&quot; as early as the 9th century. It seems to be based on the Latin surname &quot;Agius&quot;, followed by the Gaulish suffix -acum. If this theory is correct it follows that Agy was once the lands of a man called &quot;Agius&quot;.

==History==
In 1834 the parish of Agy was attached to Subles and the Agy church was put on sale for demolition. On 25 August 1834, however, residents opposed the bailiffs who came to take possession of the premises with the buyers. Faced with resistance, Alexandre Douesnel-Dubosq - public prosecutor, was summoned by the police but, armed with clubs, the population continued to oppose the destruction of the church and the cemetery. In the afternoon the National Guard of Bayeux arrived to reinforce the police with three hundred men and this ended the riot. Three protesters were sentenced by the Correctional Tribunal of Bayeux. The demolition of the church took place over the following days. The people of Subles celebrated this event which created rivalry between the two towns. A resident of Subles set up the cock from the steeple of the Agy church on his house. The people of Agy then joined the French Catholic Church of Father Châtel and launched a subscription that led to the construction of a new church and the installation of a priest who was a disciple of Father Chatel. In this way, the people had their revenge.

<text>Airan () is a former commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region of northwestern France. On 1 January 2017, it was merged into the new commune Valambray.

==Geography==
Airan is located some 17 km south-east of Caen and 25 km east by south-east of Lisieux. It can be accessed from the D40 from Vimont in the north-west, passing through the south of the commune and continuing south-east to Vieux-Fumé. The D613 (Route de Paris) also from Vimont passes through the north of the commune and continues east to Crèvecœur-en-Auge. Neither road passes the village which can be accessed by the D47 road from Moult in the west which passes through the village then the heart of the commune before continuing south-east to Cesny-aux-Vignes. There is also the D43 road coming from the north through the village and continuing south to Fierville-Bray. The railway from Caen to Mézidon-Canon passes through the commune from west to east but there is no station in the commune. The nearest station is Bonafini to the west. The commune is quite large in extent and consists almost entirely of farmland with a few small patches of forest. Apart from the village there are also the hamlets of Le Haute-des-Pedouzes, Le Ruel, Valmeray, and Coupigny.

The &quot;Muance&quot; river forms part of the western border of the commune before it flows west then north to join the Dives river through a network of canals near Bures-sur-Dives. The &quot;Douet&quot; also rises in the north of the commune and forms part of the northern border before continuing north to join the Dives near Hernetot.

==Toponymy==
The name is of Continental Germanic origin in an area where such origins are rare (&quot;Heidram&quot; from the 9th century), possibly a personal name taken from &quot;Heidrammus&quot; or alternatively the name &quot;-ham&quot; preceded by an appellative or an unidentified person&#x27;s name.

==History==
Archaeological excavations have uncovered the remains of a Merovingian necropolis. There is a legend of the famous &quot;Treasure of Airan&quot;.

In 1942, the resistance caused two derailments in the commune - on the night of 15 to 16 April and also on 30 April to 1 May. These two derailments left a total of forty dead and fifty wounded German soldiers who were on leave in these trains. Following this Nazi repression was brutal for many hostages: some were shot, others deported.

<text>Susan Alva Fleming (February 19, 1908 – December 22, 2002) was an American actress and the wife of comic actor Harpo Marx and sister in law to Groucho, Chico, Zeppo and Gummo. Fleming was known as the &quot;Girl with the Million Dollar Legs&quot; for a role she played in the W. C. Fields film &quot;Million Dollar Legs&quot; (1932). Her big stage break, which led to her Hollywood career, was as a Ziegfeld girl, performing in &quot;Rio Rita&quot;.

==Career==

Fleming was from New York City and went to school in Forest Hills, Queens. After starring in the Ziegfeld Follies productions on Broadway, she started appearing in movies with &quot;The Ace of Cads&quot;, in which she appeared under the name Suzanne Fleming. One of her earliest film roles was a starring role in &quot;The Range Feud&quot; as Judy Walton, the love interest of John Wayne. Fleming combined her dancing and cinematic interests in the 1932 movie &quot;Million Dollar Legs&quot;, in which she played the daughter of W. C. Fields&#x27;s character. As part of a publicity stunt for the film, her legs were insured for the eponymous million dollars.

Fleming was unhappy with Hollywood, stating in a 1995 interview that she found &quot;nothing more boring than working on a movie... I hated it!&quot;.

==Personal life==
I first met Harpo at a party as is typical in Hollywood. I sat next to him and Fanny Brice. He had taken her to the party because he felt she would be entertaining, and he loved to be entertained.

At a dinner party held in the home of Samuel Goldwyn in 1932, Fleming was seated next to Harpo Marx and found him fascinating. Despite his silent persona in films, she found Marx to be &quot;a warm, fun, darling man to talk to&quot;. She pursued him relentlessly, dating for four years and proposing marriage to him on three occasions before he accepted. She ended her Hollywood career when she married Marx on September 28, 1936. Fleming&#x27;s wedding to Marx was revealed to the public when President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt sent the couple a telegram of congratulations in November. Marx had sent a thank you letter to Roosevelt in appreciation for a signed photograph of the President, in which Marx had stated that he was &quot;in line for congratulations, too, having been married since September&quot; in an unspecified &quot;little town up North&quot;.

Fleming was happy to leave show business, serving as Marx&#x27;s &quot;valet&quot; and raising their four children, whom they had adopted. In addition to his widespread interest in playing musical instruments, including his trademark harp, Fleming helped foster her husband&#x27;s interest in painting; she would make elaborate frames for his paintings, as well as creating her own works of art. The two collected many artworks, which Fleming donated widely after her husband&#x27;s death. In 1956, they moved to Rancho Mirage, California, with three out of the four other Marx Brothers; Gummo, Zeppo and Groucho building homes nearby.

Fleming became active in local community affairs, was the first woman on the board of College of the Desert and was elected to the Palm Springs Unified School District Board of Education.

Harpo Marx died at age 75 on September 28, 1964, their 28th wedding anniversary. Following his death, Fleming became more involved in local activities, including the local League of Women Voters. She became an advisory planning commissioner for Rancho Mirage, California, and headed an organization dedicated to preserving development on the fragile desert hillsides. She served a total of 18 years on the district board of education and ran and lost in a campaign for the California State Assembly. Honoring her contributions, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to her in 2002.

In a 1981 decision later overruled by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in a case brought by Fleming, federal judge William C. Conner ruled that the producers of &quot;A Day in Hollywood / A Night in the Ukraine&quot; had improperly used the Marx Brothers characters in their Broadway theatre production and that the publicity rights of the comedians, even after their deaths, overrode the First Amendment issues raised by the show&#x27;s creators. In April 1980, Conner refused to issue a preliminary injunction and allowed producer Alexander H. Cohen to open the show as planned.

==Death==
Fleming outlived Marx by almost forty years during which she was an artist and activist in the Palm Springs area. She died at age 94 on December 22, 2002, of a heart attack at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage. She died on the same day as her close friend, Mary De Vithas, her brother-in-law Chico Marx&#x27;s second wife.

<text>John David Caputo (born October 26, 1940) is an American philosopher who is the Thomas J. Watson Professor of Religion Emeritus at Syracuse University and the David R. Cook Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at Villanova University. Caputo is a major figure associated with postmodern Christianity and continental philosophy of religion, as well as the founder of the theological movement known as weak theology. Much of Caputo&#x27;s work focuses on hermeneutics, phenomenology, deconstruction, and theology.

== Education ==
Caputo received his BA in 1962 from La Salle University, his MA in 1964 from Villanova University, and his PhD in philosophy in 1968 from Bryn Mawr College.

==Work==
Caputo is a specialist in contemporary continental philosophy, with a particular expertise in phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction. Over the years, he has developed a deconstructive hermeneutics that he calls radical hermeneutics, which is highly influenced by the thought of the French philosopher Jacques Derrida. Additionally, Caputo has developed a distinctive approach to religion that he calls weak theology. Recently, his most important work has been to rebut the charges of relativism made against deconstruction by showing that deconstruction is organized around the affirmation of certain unconditional ethical and political claims.

Caputo has a special interest in continental approaches to the philosophy of religion. Some of the ideas Caputo investigates in his work include the &quot;religion without religion&quot; of Jacques Derrida; the &quot;theological turn&quot; taken in recent French phenomenology by Jean-Luc Marion and others; the critique of ontotheology; the dialogue of contemporary philosophy with Augustine of Hippo and Paul of Tarsus; and medieval metaphysics and mysticism. In the past, Caputo has taught courses on Søren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Emmanuel Levinas, Gilles Deleuze, and Jacques Derrida.

==Positions held==

Caputo taught philosophy at Villanova University from 1968 to 2004. He was appointed the David R. Cook Professor of Philosophy at Villanova University in 1993. Caputo was the Thomas J. Watson Professor of Religion at Syracuse University, where he taught in both the departments of philosophy and religion from 2004 until his retirement in 2011. He is emeritus professor at both Villanova University and Syracuse University and continues to write and lecture in both the United States and Europe. He is active in the American Philosophical Association, the American Academy of Religion, the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy and he chairs the board of editors for the &quot;Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory&quot;.

<text>Irene R. Mathyssen (born August 16, 1951) is a Canadian politician and was a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons of Canada from 2006 until 2019. She was previously a New Democratic Party Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) in Ontario from 1990 to 1995, and briefly served as a minister in the government of Premier Bob Rae.

==Background==
Mathyssen was educated at the University of Western Ontario from 1970 to 1975, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and Drama, and a Bachelor of Education degree. She taught English at Saunders Secondary School in London, Ontario, until 2006 except for a five-year break between 1990 and 1995 when she was an MPP. She served on the District 11 Ontario Secondary School Teachers&#x27; Federation Political Action Committee. She was a vocal opponent of the Invasion of Iraq in 2003 and participated in many local peace rallies. Mathyssen was a member of the &quot;Ontario Health Coalition&quot;. She was president of the Middlesex NDP riding association from 1989 to 1990.

==Provincial politics==
She was elected to represent the riding of Middlesex in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1990 provincial election, defeating incumbent Liberal Doug Reycraft by 520 votes (out of 38,382 cast). She served as a government Whip from 1990 to 1991, and was a parliamentary assistant to the Minister of the Environment from 1991 to 1994. In that capacity she announced that 6 million dollars would be spent on the cleanup of beaches in rural areas which were closed mostly due to agricultural runoff issues. In 1993, she voted against a government bill to allow a municipal expansion into her rural riding. During the debate she lamented about her lack of influence on the bill. She said, &quot;There have been times when I felt utterly powerless in all of this. It&#x27;s a strange feeling for one who came here with such high hopes.&quot;

On October 21, 1994, she was named a Minister without Portfolio, responsible for Culture, Tourism and Recreation.

The NDP was defeated by the Progressive Conservative Party in the 1995 provincial election, and Mathyssen was defeated in Middlesex, finishing third behind Reycraft and winner Progressive Conservative Bruce Smith.

She ran in the London—Fanshawe riding in the 1999 provincial election and placed third, behind PC candidate Frank Mazzilli and Liberal Peter Mancini. Mathyssen ran provincially in London—Fanshawe for a second time in the 2003 provincial election, and this time finished a strong second, losing to Liberal Khalil Ramal by fewer than 2,000 votes.

==Federal politics==
She ran for the federal New Democratic Party in the 1997 election, and finished third in the riding of London—Fanshawe, well behind Liberal incumbent Pat O&#x27;Brien. O&#x27;Brien won by more than 3,000 votes.

===2006: Elected as MP===
She again ran in London—Fanshawe in the 2006 election. Pat O&#x27;Brien had left the Liberal Party by this time, and sat out his remaining time in the House of Commons as an independent. He opted not to run in the 2006 election. Mathyssen won the riding with 34% of the vote, becoming one of 29 New Democrats elected.

During the session, she was named as the NDP critic for Housing and for the Status of Women. In November 2006, she tabled a Private member&#x27;s bill which she called the Housing Bill of Rights which would have provided secure housing for Canadians. The bill got no further than its first reading. A similar bill proposed by Libby Davies in 2004 also died on the order paper.

During a parliamentary session on December 5, 2007, Mathyssen committed a blunder when she stood in the Commons and accused Conservative James Moore of looking at images of &quot;scantily clad&quot; women on his personal laptop computer at his desk in the House of Commons. She openly questioned his integrity and said his actions &quot;disrespected women&quot;. James Moore denied the allegations were true. Later in the day, Mathyssen and Moore spoke in person about the incident; Moore explained that the woman he had been looking at on his laptop computer screen was his girlfriend. Shortly after, Mathyssen retracted her statement and apologized to Moore.

===2008: Re-elected===
Mathyssen was re-elected as the Member of Parliament for London-Fanshawe in the 2008 federal election. In that election, she was the only incumbent in the London region re-elected with increased total vote (17,672) and percentage of popular vote (43.1%). In addition to retaining her role as Status of Women critic, Mathyssen was also named the NDP&#x27;s deputy critic for public safety, and in this role, she has been an advocate for Canadian firefighters. She also served as the NDP&#x27;s deputy critic for Veterans&#x27; Affairs.

In December 2010, Mathyssen introduced Bill C-601, which allowed any worker who had lost their job through no fault of their own to make a single lump sum payment over the maximum allowable investment into their Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) without financial penalty. It also ensured that workers would receive the maximum amount of Employment Insurance benefits for which they are eligible; workers would be able to collect EI immediately despite receiving severance pay.

===2011: Re-elected===
In the 2011 election, Mathyssen was re-elected with 50% of the popular vote, defeating Conservative candidate Jim Chahbar by over 7,000 votes. She was named the Official Opposition Critic for Seniors in the NDP’s shadow cabinet by Jack Layton. Despite the tradition of committee chairs going to government MPs, she served as chair of the House of Commons Committee on the Status of Women.

On January 1, 2012, Caterpillar Inc. locked out over 450 workers from the Electro Motive Diesel plant in Mathyssen’s riding of London-Fanshawe. Mathyssen was a vocal critic of the company’s actions and a strong supporter of the locked out workers. After the company announced it was closing the plant on February 3, Mathyssen put forward a motion in the House of Commons to amend the Investment Canada Act to prevent companies from taking these actions in the future.

In October 2013, Mathyssen introduced Bill C-282 to eliminate the HST on feminine hygiene products. The idea gained popular grassroots support, with a group called &quot;Canadian Menstruators&quot; organizing an online petition that rapidly attracted tens of thousands of signatures from across Canada. Mathyssen took the lead in the House of Commons for an NDP Opposition Day, introducing a motion to force a vote on the issue. The governing Conservatives initially tried to stall the effort promising to revisit the idea in the future, without a clear timeline. Mathyssen would not relent however, and with more than 74,000 Canadians having signed the petition, the Conservatives, with pressure mounting from their own female MPs threatening to not show up for the vote, changed course at the last moment. With the backing of MPs from all political parties in the House of Commons, Mathyssen&#x27;s motion passed and the tax was eliminated on July 1, 2015.

=== 2015: Re-elected ===
In October 2015, Mathyssen was re-elected for another term in parliament. Despite a strong &quot;Stop Harper&quot; campaign that led to increased voter turnout and sent a wave of popular support to Justin Trudeau&#x27;s Liberals at the expense of the NDP, Mathyssen not only held her seat in London-Fanshawe, but retained almost all of the 20,000+ votes she received in 2011. NDP leader Tom Mulcair named Mathyssen the party&#x27;s Critic for Veterans Affairs and the deputy whip for the caucus.

In August 2018, Mathyssen announced that she would be retiring from politics and would not seek re-election in the 2019 federal election.

<doc id="484677" wikidata="Q4351939" url="?curid=484677" title="HMS King Edward VII">
<text>HMS &quot;King Edward VII&quot;, named after King Edward VII, was the lead ship of her class of pre-dreadnought battleships built for the British Royal Navy. Armed with a battery of four and four guns, she and her sister ships marked a significant advance in offensive power compared to earlier British battleship designs that did not carry the 9.2 in guns. &quot;King Edward VII&quot; was built at the Devonport Dockyard, and was laid down in March 1902, launched in July 1903, and completed in February 1905.

The ship entered service with the Atlantic Fleet as the fleet flagship before being transferred to the Channel Fleet in 1907, where she also served as the flagship. The Channel Fleet became the Home Fleet in 1909, where she remained for the next several years. During this period, the fleet was repeatedly reorganized, with &quot;King Edward VII&quot; ultimately ending up in the 3rd Battle Squadron by 1912, along with her sisters. The ships were sent to the Mediterranean during the First Balkan War to enforce the transfer of Scutari to Albania. Following the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the 3rd Battle Squadron became part of the Grand Fleet, where &quot;King Edward VII&quot; served for the next two years. The Grand Fleet conducted numerous sweeps into the North Sea in the hope of catching German vessels at sea, but rarely found action.

On the morning of 6 January 1916, while steaming to Belfast for a refit, &quot;King Edward VII&quot; struck a naval mine that had been laid by the German auxiliary cruiser . Attempts to tow &quot;King Edward VII&quot; to port failed when she took on a dangerous list, so she was abandoned and her crew evacuated to several destroyers. &quot;King Edward VII&quot; sank later that day.

==Design==


Following the development of pre-dreadnought type battleships carrying heavy secondary guns of diameter in the Italian &quot;Regia Marina&quot; and the United States Navy, the Royal Navy decided to build similar ships. Initial proposals called for a battleship equipped with eight guns to support the main battery, though under the direction of William Henry White, the Director of Naval Construction, these were replaced with four guns. The new ships, though based on the general type that had formed the basis of the preceding four battleship designs, marked the first significant change in the series. Like all late pre-dreadnoughts that entered service in the mid-1900s, &quot;King Edward VII&quot; was made almost instantaneously obsolescent by the commissioning of the all-big-gun in December 1906, armed with a battery of ten heavy guns compared to the typical four of most pre-dreadnoughts.

&quot;King Edward VII&quot; was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . The &quot;King Edward VII&quot;-class battleships displaced normally and up to fully loaded. Her crew numbered 777 officers and ratings. The &quot;King Edward VII&quot;-class ships were powered by a pair of 4-cylinder triple-expansion engines that drove two screws, with steam provided by sixteen water-tube boilers. The boilers were trunked into two funnels located amidships. The &quot;King Edward VII&quot;-class ships had a top speed of from .

&quot;King Edward VII&quot; had a main battery of four 40-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft. These were supported by a heavy secondary battery of four guns in four single turrets, two on each broadside. The ships also mounted ten 45-calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to fourteen 12-pounder guns and fourteen 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with five torpedo tubes submerged in the hull; two were on each broadside, with the fifth in the stern.

&quot;King Edward VII&quot; had an armoured belt that was thick; the transverse bulkheads on the aft end of the belt was thick. The sides of her main battery turrets were also 8 to 12 in thick, atop 12 in barbettes, and the 9.2 turrets had sides. The casemate battery was protected with of armour plate. Her conning tower had 12-inch-thick sides. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively.

==Service history==
===Pre-First World War===
When &quot;King Edward VII&quot; was laid down at Devonport Dockyard on 8 March 1902, the first plate was laid by King Edward VII, who with his wife Queen Alexandra had just attended the naming and launching ceremony of . &quot;King Edward VII&quot; was launched by her namesake on 23 July 1903 and was completed in February 1905. Edward VII consented to having &quot;King Edward VII&quot; carry his name on the condition that she always serve as a flagship. The Royal Navy honoured this wish throughout her career. &quot;King Edward VII&quot; was commissioned on 7 February at Devonport Dockyard for service as Flagship, Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet. She underwent a refit in 1906–1907, during which her superstructure 12-pounder guns were temporarily relocated to the top of her main battery turrets. Her Atlantic Fleet service ended when she paid off at Portsmouth Dockyard on 4 March 1907.

On 5 March, &quot;King Edward VII&quot; was recommissioned as flagship of Admiral Lord Charles Beresford, Commander-in-Chief, Channel Fleet. She underwent another refit at Portsmouth in 1907–1908. During this refit, her 12-pounders returned to their original locations, and the 3-pounders on her bridge were removed. Under a fleet reorganisation on 24 March 1909, the Channel Fleet became the 2nd Division, Home Fleet. Accordingly, &quot;King Edward VII&quot; was recommissioned as the Flagship, Vice Admiral, Home Fleet on 27 March. She underwent a refit at Portsmouth from December to February 1910. She was recommissioned at Portsmouth on 1 August 1911 as the Flagship, Vice Admiral, Third and Fourth Divisions, Home Fleet.

Under a fleet reorganisation in May 1912, &quot;King Edward VII&quot; and all seven of her sisters – , , , , , , and – were assigned to form the 3rd Battle Squadron, assigned to the First Fleet, Home Fleet. &quot;King Edward VII&quot; was commissioned at Sheerness as the Flagship, Vice Admiral, 3rd Battle Squadron, First Fleet, Home Fleet, on 14 May 1912. The 3rd Battle Squadron was detached to the Mediterranean in November 1912 because of the First Balkan War (October 1912 – May 1913); it arrived at Malta on 27 November 1912 and subsequently participated, as part of an international force, in a blockade of Montenegro and in an occupation of Scutari to force the Macedonians to relinquish the city to the newly-formed Albania. The squadron returned to the United Kingdom in 1913 and rejoined the Home Fleet on 27 June 1913.

===First World War===
Upon the outbreak of the First World War, the 3rd Battle Squadron was assigned to the Grand Fleet and based at Rosyth, with &quot;King Edward VII&quot; continuing her service as squadron flagship, at the time under the command of Vice Admiral Edward Bradford. The squadron was reinforced with the five s, and was used to supplement the Grand Fleet&#x27;s cruisers on the Northern Patrol. On 6 August, the day after Britain declared war on Germany, elements of the Grand Fleet sortied to inspect the coast of Norway in search of a German naval base violating Norwegian neutrality. &quot;King Edward VII&quot; and the rest of the 3rd Battle Squadron provided distant support to the operation. No such base was found, and the ships returned to port the next day. On 14 August, the ships of the Grand Fleet went to sea for battle practice before conducting a sweep into the North Sea later that day and into 15 August.

In late August, &quot;King Edward VII&quot; reported that two of her four 12-inch guns had developed cracks in the inner tubes, necessitating replacement. She accordingly left Scapa Flow for Devonport to have the guns replaced, Bradford shifting his flag to her sister ship &quot;Dominion&quot; temporarily. &quot;King Edward VII&quot; returned to the fleet on 2 September, at which point &quot;Dominion&quot; was sent to have her guns replaced. On 2 November, the squadron was detached to reinforce the Channel Fleet and was rebased at Portland. The squadron returned to the Grand Fleet on 13 November, although &quot;King Edward VII&quot; remained behind temporarily, not returning to the Grand Fleet until 30 November. During sweeps by the fleet, she and her sisters often steamed at the heads of divisions of the far more valuable dreadnoughts, where they could protect the dreadnoughts by watching for mines or by being the first to strike them.
On 14 December, the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, 2nd Battle Squadron, and accompanying cruisers and destroyers left port to intercept the German forces preparing to raid Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby. On the first reports of contact with German units on the morning of 16 December, the Grand Fleet commander, Admiral John Jellicoe, ordered Bradford to take the 3rd Battle Squadron to support the ships in contact at 10:00. Four hours later, they met the 1st and 4th Battle Squadrons, &quot;en route&quot; from Scapa Flow, though they failed to reach the German High Seas Fleet before the latter withdrew. The Grand Fleet remained at sea until late on 17 December, at which point the 3rd Battle Squadron was ordered back to Rosyth. &quot;King Edward VII&quot; and the rest of the squadron joined the Grand Fleet for another sweep into the North Sea on 25 December. The fleet returned to its ports two days later, having failed to locate any German vessels.

The 3rd Battle Squadron went to sea on 12 January 1915 for gunnery training, steaming north and passing to the west of Orkney on the night of 13–14 January. After completing training on the 14th, they returned to Rosyth on 15 January. On 23 January, the 1st and 2nd Battlecruiser Squadrons sortied to ambush the German I Scouting Group in what resulted in the Battle of Dogger Bank the following day. Later on the 23rd, the rest of the Grand Fleet, including &quot;King Edward VII&quot;, sortied to support the battlecruisers. The 3rd Squadron ships left first and steamed at full speed to reach ships of the Harwich Force, which had reported contact with German vessels. The battlecruisers intervened first, and &quot;King Edward VII&quot; and her sisters arrived around 14:00, by which time the battlecruisers had sunk the armoured cruiser and the surviving German ships had fled. The 3rd Battle Squadron patrolled the area with the rest of the Grand Fleet over the night before being detached at 08:00 on 25 January to steam to Rosyth.

Elements of the Grand Fleet went to sea repeatedly over the next few months. The 3rd Battle Squadron patrolled the central North Sea in company with the 3rd Cruiser Squadron from 10–13 March. The two units again went to sea to sweep the central North Sea from 5–8 April. A major fleet operation followed on 11 April, with the entire Grand Fleet sortieing for a sweep of the North Sea on 12–13 April. The squadrons returned to their ports on 14 April to replenish their fuel. Another such operation followed on 17 April, which also failed to find any German ships. The 3rd Battle Squadron returned to Rosyth late on 18 April. The fleet sortied again on 21 April, returning to port two days later. The 3rd Battle Squadron, joined by the 3rd Cruiser Squadron, patrolled the northern North Sea from 5–10 May, during which a German U-boat attacked the battleships but failed to score a hit.

Another sweep into the North Sea took place from 17–19 May, and no German forces were encountered. The fleet went to sea again on 29 May for a patrol south to the Dogger Bank before returning to port on 31 May, again without having located any German vessels. The Grand Fleet spent much of June in port conducting training, but the most modern units went to sea on 11 June for gunnery practice to the northwest of Shetland. While they were training, &quot;King Edward VII&quot; and the rest of the 3rd Battle Squadron, along with the 3rd Cruiser Squadron, patrolled the central North Sea. Fleet activities were limited in July, owing to a threatened strike by coal miners, which began on 18 July and threatened the supply of coal for the fleet&#x27;s ships. The strike continued into August, which led Jellicoe to continue to limit fleet activities to preserve his stocks of coal. The fleet saw little activity in September, and during this period, the Grand Fleet began to go to sea without the 3rd Battle Squadron.

====Loss====
On 6 January 1916, &quot;King Edward VII&quot;—having transferred her flag temporarily—departed Scapa Flow at 07:12 on a voyage around the northern coast of Scotland to Belfast, where she was scheduled to undergo a refit. At 10:47, she struck a mine that had been laid by the German auxiliary cruiser off Cape Wrath five days before. &quot;Möwe&quot; had slipped past British patrols and laid 252 mines under cover of darkness and a snow storm. The explosion occurred under the starboard engine room, and &quot;King Edward VII&quot; took on a list of 8° to starboard. Her commanding officer, Captain (later Admiral) Crawford Maclachlan, ordered her helm put over to starboard to close the coast and beach the ship if necessary, but the helm jammed hard to starboard and the engine rooms quickly flooded, stopping the engines. Counterflooding reduced her list to 5°. Signals to the passing collier &quot;Princess Melita&quot; induced her to close with &quot;King Edward VII&quot; and attempt to tow the battleship. Initially believing the attack to have been from a German U-boat, the flotilla leader and twelve destroyers sortied to come to &quot;King Edward VII&quot;″s aid. After arriving on the scene, &quot;Kempenfelt&quot; joined the tow attempt. Towing began at 14:15, but &quot;King Edward VII&quot; settled deeper in the water and took on a 15° list in a rising sea and strong winds and soon proved to be unmanageable. &quot;Princess Melita&quot;″s towline parted at 14:40, after which Captain Maclachlan ordered &quot;Kempenfelt&quot; to slip her tow as well.

With flooding continuing and darkness approaching, Captain Maclachlan ordered &quot;King Edward VII&quot; abandoned. The destroyer came alongside at 14:45, and she and destroyers and , took off the crew with the loss of only one life (a man fell between the battleship and one of the rescue vessels), the last man off being Captain Maclachlan, who boarded destroyer at 16:10. &quot;Fortune&quot;, &quot;Marne&quot;, and &quot;Musketeer&quot; departed to take the battleship&#x27;s crew to port, while &quot;Nessus&quot; stayed on the scene until 17:20 with tugs that had arrived to assist. After &quot;Nessus&quot; departed, the tugs continued to stand by, and saw &quot;King Edward VII&quot; capsize at 20:10 and sink around nine hours after the explosion. The cause of her loss was initially unknown, as the British were at that time unaware of &quot;Möwe&quot;″s minefield, and the battleship &quot;Africa&quot; had passed through the area earlier that day without incident. A shortage of minesweepers also delayed discovery of the minefield.

<text>Montecito is the code-name of a major release of Intel&#x27;s Itanium 2 Processor Family (IPF), which implements the &quot;Intel Itanium architecture&quot; on a dual-core processor. It was officially launched by Intel on July 18, 2006, as the &quot;Dual-Core Intel Itanium 2 processor&quot;. According to Intel, Montecito doubles performance versus the previous, single-core Itanium 2 processor, and reduces power consumption by about 20%. It also adds multi-threading capabilities (two threads per core), a greatly expanded cache subsystem (12 MB per core), and silicon support for virtualization.

==Architectural features and attributes==


* Two cores per die
* 2-way coarse-grained multithreading per core (not simultaneous). Montecito-flavour of multi-threading is dubbed temporal, or TMT. This is also known as switch-on-event multithreading, or SoEMT. The two separate threads do not run simultaneously, but the core switches thread in case of a high latency event, like an L3 cache miss which would otherwise stall execution. By this technique, multi-threaded workloads, including database-like workloads, should improve by 15-35%.
* a total of 4 threads per die
* separate 16 KB Instruction L1 and 16 KB Data L1 cache per core
* separate 1 MB Instruction L2 and 256 KB Data L2 cache per core, improved hierarchy
* 12 MB L3 cache per core, 24 MB L3 per die
* 1.72 billion transistors per die, which is added up from:
** core logic — 57M, or 28.5M per core
** core caches — 106.5M
** 24 MB L3 cache — 1550M
** bus logic &amp; I/O — 6.7M
* Die size is 27.72 mm × 21.5 mm, or 596 mm2
* 90 nanometer design
* Lower power consumption and thermal dissipation than earlier flagship Itaniums, despite the high transistor count; 75-104 W. This is mainly achieved by applying different types of transistors. By default, slower and low-leakage transistors were used, while high-speed, thus high-leakage ones where it was necessary.
* Advanced compensation for errors in cache, for reliable operation under mission-critical workloads. This was code-named Pellston technology during development, and has recently been renamed Intel Cache Safe Technology.
* Virtualization technology allowing multiple OS instances per chip. This was known as Silvervale technology during development, and is now called Intel Virtualization Technology.
* Improved, higher bandwidth front side bus (FSB), with three times the capacity of the existing bus design. It is meant to be at system level (per node, with 4 dies). System throughput per node should be at least 21 GB/s, which suggest dual 333.333 MHz (double pumped, resulting 2×667 effective MHz) front side bus. However, it is up to system integrators how they organize their bus topology.
* All Montecito processors support 533 MHz / 400 MHz FSB speed.
* Also available with legacy FSB for upgrading existing system designs.
* Eliminates the hardware-based x86 instruction emulation circuitry, in favor of the more efficient software-based IA-32 Execution Layer.

On October 25, 2005, Intel announced that the first dual-core Itanium processor would be delayed until &quot;the middle of next year.&quot; Montecito was launched on July 18, 2006. Due to unspecified issues, Intel&#x27;s Foxton power management technology was disabled in the first release of Montecito, and the front-side bus frequency was reduced to 267 MHz (533.333 MHz effective) instead of the 333 MHz speed originally scheduled for the design [3].

At the time of launch, the following models and pricing were available: 
* Itanium 2 9050 1.60 GHz / 24 MB L3 — $3,692
* Itanium 2 9040 1.60 GHz / 16 MB L3 — $1,980
* Itanium 2 9030 1.60 GHz / 8 MB L3 — $1,552
* Itanium 2 9020 1.42 GHz / 12 MB L3 — $910
* Itanium 2 9015 1.40 GHz / 12 MB L3 — $749
* Itanium 2 9010 1.60 GHz / 6 MB L3 / single core — $696

There are no plans for additional Montecito processors; the successor, Montvale was released in late 2007.

<text>HMS &quot;Loch Alvie&quot; was a of the Royal Navy, named after Loch Alvie in Scotland. She was ordered by the Royal Navy during World War II, but did not see action with them, having transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy before commissioning. After the war she returned to the Royal Navy and would pass in and out of service until 1963.

==Construction and design==
&quot;Loch Alvie&quot; was ordered 2 February 1943. She was laid down on 31 August 1943 by Barclay, Curle &amp; Company at Glasgow and launched on 14 April 1944. She was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy and commissioned on 10 August 1944 at Dalmuir, Scotland.

&quot;Loch Alvie&quot; was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was standard and deep load. She was powered by two 4-cylinder triple expansion steam engines fed with steam from two Admiralty 3-drum boilers and rated at . This gave a speed of . Sufficient fuel was carried to give a range of at in tropical waters.

The ship&#x27;s main gun armament was a single QF 4-inch (102 mm) Mk V gun forward, with an anti-aircraft armament of a quadruple 2-pounder (40-mm) pom-pom aft and at least six Oerlikon 20 mm cannon (two twin powered mountings and at least two single mounts). Two Squid anti-submarine mortars were fitted, with 120 rounds carried, backed up by 15 conventional depth charges. As built, the ship had a complement of 114 officers and men.

&quot;Loch Alvie&quot; underwent significant modification when under refit from 1952 to 1954, with the ship&#x27;s gun armament being heavily revised. The 4-inch gun was replaced by a twin Mk XVI 4-inch dual-purpose mount, while the close-in anti-aircraft armament was replaced by an outfit of six Bofors 40 mm guns (1 twin and 4 single mounts), while communications equipment was also upgraded.

==Service history==

===World War II===
After commissioning, &quot;Loch Alvie&quot; worked up at Tobermory. She joined the 9th Escort Group at Londonderry Port on 19 September 1944. After escorting convoys to and from Gibraltar, on 29 November she sailed as part of the escort of Russian Convoy JW 62, arriving at Murmansk on 7 December, and the return convoy RA 62, which left Kola Bay on 10 December, with &quot;Loch Alvie&quot; leaving the convoy on 17 December. She then returned to Liverpool for repairs.

The ship returned to convoy escort and anti-submarine operations in the English Channel in February 1945. The frigate deployed into the English Channel with the 9th escort group from 14 March to 20 April 1945. Later &quot;Loch Alvie&quot; joined Task Group 122.3 for anti-submarine operations and support duties in the South-Western Approaches and Irish Sea while based at Milford Haven.

After the German surrender in May &quot;Loch Alvie&quot; returned to the Clyde and took part in escorting Convoy JW67 – the last convoy to Russia – before being sent to Trondheim to escort fourteen U-boats to Loch Eriboll as part of &quot;Operation Deadlight&quot;.

In June 1945 &quot;Loch Alvie&quot; was returned to the Royal Navy, paid off officially from the Royal Canadian Navy on 11 July and put into reserve at Sheerness. &quot;Lock Alvie&quot; and were the only two Canadian ships of the war never to visit a Canadian port.

===Post-war===
&quot;Loch Alvie&quot; was recommissioned in April 1950 to serve in the 6th Frigate Flotilla of the Home Fleet. In 1951 she took part in the search operation to find the missing submarine . The ship was again decommissioned in April 1952 and placed in reserve at Chatham.

In October 1952, she started a major modernisation and refit at Portsmouth dockyard where her armament was revised, with the refit continuing until January 1954. On completing the refit she was re-commissioned for service in the Persian Gulf.

In October 1960 &quot;Loch Alvie&quot; completed another refit before returning to the Persian Gulf. In April 1961, when the passenger liner suffered an explosion, &quot;Loch Alvie&quot; took part in attempts to stop the resulting fires and salvage the ship. Later that year she was deployed to Kuwait as part of Operation Vantage, a deployment of British forces to Kuwait in response to Iraqi threats of invasion.

&quot;Loch Alvie&quot; was decommissioned at Singapore in November 1963. During 1964 she was stripped of equipment, and the hulk sold to Hong Huat Hardware, Singapore, for scrapping on 20 September 1965.

<text>HMS &quot;Loch Dunvegan&quot; was a frigate of the British Royal Navy, named after Loch Dunvegan in Scotland. Launched in 1944, the ship saw service in the Second World War, and in the Mediterranean Fleet in the early 1950s, before being broken up in 1960.

==Service history==

===Second World War===
Commissioned in June 1944, the ship was allocated for service in the 10th Escort Group for Atlantic convoy defence duty. In August she was detached to the 20th Escort Group for Russian convoy duty, joining Convoy JW 59 to Murmansk. On 24 August &quot;Loch Dunvegan&quot; took part in the sinking of the . The next day the convoy arrived at Kola Inlet and the ship was detached to join Convoy RA 59A for the return journey.

In March the Group was transferred to the English Channel to continue operations against U-boats.

===Post-war===
After the German surrender in May 1945 the ship was transferred to the Rosyth Escort Force and also employed in Air-Sea Rescue duty in the Atlantic. She also supported re-occupation operations in Norway. In August 1945 &quot;Loch Dunvegan&quot; was transferred to 1st Anti-Submarine Training Flotilla based at Londonderry, where she served until August 1947 when she was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Devonport.

In 1948 her pennant number was changed to K425 from F425.

===Mediterranean Fleet, 1950s===
After a refit &quot;Loch Dunvegan&quot; was recommissioned on 1 May 1950 for service in the 2nd Frigate Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet, arriving at Malta on 26 June. The usual programme of exercises and visits followed, and including a period as Guard ship at Aqaba. While under repair at Gibraltar on 27 April 1951 she gave assistance after the destruction of the ammunition ship RFA &quot;Bedenham&quot; in an explosion. In May 1951 she returned to Malta to rejoin the 2nd Frigate Flotilla, but when entering Mellieħa, she grounded, sustaining extensive damage, including the loss of propeller blades. Further repairs took until September, and on her arrival at Sliema the ship was involved in a series of collisions, including one with the destroyer . In January–February 1952 &quot;Loch Dunvegan&quot; was deployed as Guardship at Port Said, and provided shore parties in support of the military authorities after widespread anti-British riots. Flotilla duties and exercises then occupied her until November 1952 when she returned to the UK, was decommissioned and put into reserve at Devonport and then Penarth.

&quot;Loch Dunvegan&quot; remained in reserve at Penarth until 1960 when she was sold for scrapping at Thos. W. Ward of Briton Ferry, where the ship arrived under tow on 24 August 1960.

Allison was one of thirteen Canadians banned from traveling to Russia under retaliatory sanctions imposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in March 2014.

After the House of Commons introduced a vaccine mandate, Allison claimed a medical exemption. He attended House meetings virtually.

In February 2023, Allison, along with fellow Conservative MPs Leslyn Lewis and Colin Carrie, had dinner with Christine Anderson, a Member of the European Parliament representing Alternative for Germany, who was on a Canadian tour of right-wing media and convoy protest supporters. The meeting was condemned by the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau among others, for Anderson and AfD&#x27;s Islamophobic and antisemitic positions. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre also denounced Anderson&#x27;s views as &quot;vile&quot;, racist, and said that &quot;it would be better if Anderson never visited Canada in the first place&quot;. The three MPs released a joint-statement saying that while meetings with foreign elected officials are ordinary, they were unaware of her or her party&#x27;s views, and that they condemned racist and hateful views.

<text>Canberra Stadium, commercially known as GIO Stadium Canberra, is a facility primarily used for rugby league and rugby union games, located adjacent to the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra, the capital of Australia. It is the largest sports venue by capacity in Canberra.

The Canberra Stadium was previously known as the Bruce Stadium and the National Athletics Stadium before its current name.

==History==
The facility was designed by architect Philip Cox and constructed by Leighton Contractors. It opened on 29 October 1977.

In 1977, it was the venue for the Pacific Conference Games, and was also the venue for the 4th IAAF World Cup in Athletics. At the latter meet, the still-current world record for the women&#x27;s 400m was recorded by East German Marita Koch, and a world record for the women&#x27;s 4 × 100 m relay was set by East Germany, which stood until the 2012 London Olympic Games.

In the late 1980s, the running track was removed and the warm-up track next door upgraded. New offices, seating, and photo-finish facilities were added. In the 1990 NSWRL season, the reigning NSWRL premiers the Canberra Raiders moved to Bruce Stadium from Seiffert Oval in Queanbeyan, their home ground since entering the New South Wales Rugby League in 1982. The Raiders won their second straight premiership in 1990.

The removal of the athletics track meant that Australian rules football games, more specifically those of the Australian Football League (AFL), could be played at the ground, resulting in pre-season matches being scheduled as early as 1990. In 1995, an AFL match for premiership points was contested between the West Coast Eagles and Fitzroy. There were also a number of pre-season AFL games played at the venue, mostly featuring the Sydney Swans.

Also around that time, a cricket pitch was placed in the centre of the ground as an experiment, and a day/night one-day cricket match was played between two local teams before a small crowd. Regular cricket matches on the ground did not eventuate.

Further renovations occurred in 1997, in preparation for staging soccer matches as part of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, which shrank the size of the playing field, preventing any future Australian rules football games being played there. The final cost of the renovations was more than seven times what had been originally anticipated by the Territory government of the time, and the subsequent controversy ended the career of then Chief Minister Kate Carnell. During the lead-up, unseasonal snow fell on 28 May 2000, during a match between the Raiders and the Wests Tigers, the only such occasion in National Rugby League history, with the snow causing frost damage to the turf intended for the Olympic soccer tournament.

Olympic soccer in 2000 initiated a stadium facelift, converting the playing surface from oval to rectangular and bringing the crowd closer to the action. It is now an all-seater rectangular stadium with two main grandstands on either side of the playing field. The major disadvantage of that revamp was that the stadium could no longer host AFL games. All top-class cricket and Australian rules football games in Canberra are now staged at the 15,000-capacity Manuka Oval.

A 2008 Rugby League World Cup game between Scotland and France was played at Canberra Stadium, the first ever rugby league test played at the venue. France defeated Scotland 36–16.

In 2009, there was an A-League bid from Canberra that, if successful would have seen an A-League soccer team play at the stadium starting with the 2010–11 season. However, the League decided that the new teams would be Sydney Rovers FC (which dissolved due to financial problems) and Melbourne Heart FC.

To coincide with Canberra&#x27;s 100th birthday celebrations, the stadium was chosen to host the 2013 Rugby League Anzac Test between Australia and New Zealand. On 19 April 2013 in what was the first game ever played by the Kangaroos in Australia&#x27;s capital city, a crowd of 25,628 saw Australia defeat their Trans-Tasman rivals 32–12.

In January 2014, Canberra Stadium was rebranded GIO Stadium Canberra as part of a naming rights deal with GIO Insurance.

A new video screen was installed at the southern end of the stadium in March 2020.

==Ownership==
The stadium is currently owned by the Australian Government through the Australian Sports Commission and leased to the Government of the Australian Capital Territory. While the current lease is due to expire in 2010, the ACT Government is seeking ownership of the stadium through a land transfer with the Australian Government.

==Seating and capacity==
Capacity is a nominal all-seated 25,011, the largest crowd being 28,753 for the 2004 Super 12 Final. The main grandstand is named after Canberra Raiders and Australian rugby league player Mal Meninga, and a statue of another Raiders and Australian league representative Laurie Daley adorns the main grandstand entrance.
The eastern grandstand was named the Gregan/Larkham Grandstand on 28 April 2007, after Brumbies and Australia rugby union greats George Gregan and Stephen Larkham. Both ended their international careers after the 2007 Rugby World Cup as the two most-capped players in Wallabies history (at that time), with Gregan at a world-record 139 and Larkham at 102.

=== Crowd records ===
== Possible replacement ==
Whilst the stadium suits the needs of its two current primary tenants, as of 2017 it is the smallest Super Rugby stadium and only a medium-sized NRL venue. The stadium itself is approaching 35 years old, and despite modernisations over the years is lacking in certain amenities for fans – especially covered seating.

Additionally, Australia had bid for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and Canberra Stadium does not meet the necessary criteria to host matches. As such, the ACT Government launched a study examining the upgrade or replacement of Canberra Stadium, with options ranging from increasing capacity and enclosing the current facility, to completely re-configuring the current stadium to an oval for cricket and Australian rules football and building a state of the art rectangular facility next door.

Citing costs of building multiple facilities as an issue, ACT Sports Minister Andrew Barr indicated his preference would be a &#x27;super stadium&#x27; built with World Cup standard facilities and capacity, able to be reduced to approximately 30,000 seats after the event. Such a facility would have to incorporate movable seating in order to accommodate all of the major Australian sporting codes.

The official bid for the 2022 World Cup indicated that the &#x27;super stadium&#x27; plan was unlikely and the original plan of a new rectangular stadium built next door to the current stadium, with the existing facility re-configured for oval field sports, was considered to be the likely outcome.

After the failed World Cup bid a new rectangular covered stadium was proposed for Canberra. In 2013 the ACT government announced plans to build a 30,000 covered (with a roof similar to Forsyth Barr Stadium) rectangular stadium in the city on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin. It would be part of a 15-year significant redevelopment of the foreshore which extends the city to the Eastern Basin. Along with the stadium, as part of the redevelopment there would be apartments, a convention centre and an urban beach. Plans to build a new stadium have, however, been put on hold indefinitely due to the need for funds to compensate local residents over an asbestos home insulation debacle. Plans to construct the new stadium have since been pushed back by a decade.

<text>West Burra is one of the Scalloway Islands, a subgroup of the Shetland Islands in Scotland. It is connected by bridge to East Burra. With an area of , it is the eleventh-largest of the Shetland Islands.

==Geography==
The nearby south-facing sandy beach at Meal is a popular place on a warm day. At the south end of West Burra is Kettla Ness, with impressive cliff scenery; it is linked to the main island by a shingle and sand tombolo which also provides another attractive sandy beach. At Duncansclett, a traditional thatched cottage has recently been restored for use by the local history group; the building featured in the BBC television series, &quot;Restoration&quot; in 2003.

West Burra is linked to the Shetland Mainland via Trondra by a series of bridges.

===Settlements===
Hamnavoe (an extremely common Shetland name) is the main settlement, and there is also Bridge End, so called because it is near the bridge to East Burra.

==History==
The form used in the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; is &quot;Barrey&quot;. &quot;Collins Encyclopedia of Scotland&quot; suggests that Burra is a corruption of &quot;Borgarey&quot; meaning &quot;island of the broch&quot;. The place name Brough lends some support to this case and a nearby hillock may have been a broch from which stones were removed to build the pier at Scalloway.

The name Papil in the south of West Burra is a Norse reference to the &quot;Papar&quot;. This name can be found in the form Papyli in several locations in Iceland. However, it is not just Papil&#x27;s etymology that suggests the site of an early church, confirmation has been found in the form of the &quot;Monk&#x27;s Stone&quot;, which was dug up in Papil and which is now in the Shetland Museum.

The main village of Hamnavoe in the north of West Burra is unique among villages in Shetland, in having been planned and laid out by the factors of the estate, in much the same way as many estate villages created by &#x27;improving&#x27; landlords in Scotland; another parallel, albeit on a larger scale, is Ullapool, created by the British Fisheries Society. The original plan form is still clearly visible, despite the accretion of later development. Hamnavoe was once an important fishing centre. Today, none of the larger Shetland fishing boats is likely to be seen here but smaller vessels catch shellfish. Although full-time fishermen still live in the area, the fishing tradition is nowadays more evident in fish farming; there are several mussel and salmon farms around Burra.

==Notable people from West Burra==
* Thomas Fraser, a Country and Western musician who was born at Outterabrake and lived much of his life at Setter.

<text>East Burra () is one of the Scalloway Islands, a subgroup of the Shetland Islands in Scotland. It is connected by a bridge to West Burra.

With an area of it is the twelfth largest of the Shetland Islands.

East Burra has a much smaller population than West Burra and no substantial settlement; rather, there are a few hamlets and a scattering of individual croft houses. It is known for its Neolithic remains including a burnt mound, and for sea caves. The roofless, plain, Old Haa (manor or laird&#x27;s house) of Houss is a prominent feature. From Houss, it is possible to walk the two kilometres or so to the cliffs at the southern end of the island. From there, the island of South Havra, nowadays home only to sheep and seabirds, can be clearly seen.

East Burra is linked to the Shetland Mainland via West Burra and Trondra by a series of bridges.

==Etymology==
&quot;Collins Encyclopedia of Scotland&quot; suggests that the name &quot;Burra&quot; is a corruption of &quot;Borgarey&quot; (island of the broch), and while this is unlikely, and no broch is extant, the place name Brough, on West Burra lends some support to this case. However, the form used in the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; is &quot;Barrey&quot;.

<text>A lateral [[buoy]], lateral post or lateral mark, as defined by the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities, is a sea mark used in maritime pilotage to indicate the edge of a channel.

Each mark indicates the edge of the safe water channel in terms of port (left-hand) or starboard (right-hand). These directions are relative to the &quot;direction of buoyage&quot;; this is usually a nominally upstream direction. In a river, the direction of buoyage is towards the river&#x27;s source; in a harbour, the direction of buoyage is into the harbour from the sea. Where there may be doubt, it will be labelled on the appropriate chart. Often the cardinal mark system is used instead when confusion about the direction would be common.

A vessel heading in the direction of buoyage (e.g. into a harbour) and wishing to keep in the main channel should:
* keep port marks to its port (left) side, and
* keep starboard marks to its starboard (right) side.

== IALA System ==

Marks are distinguished by their shape and colour, being red or green.

For historical reasons, two different schemes are in use worldwide, differing in their use of colour. Previously there had been 30 different buoyage systems, before IALA rationalised the system. In 1980 on a conference convened by IALA, they agreed to adopt the rules of a new combined system, which combined the previous two systems (A and B) into one system, with two regions (A and B).

The IALA defines them as Region A and Region B:

=== Region A ===

* comprises Europe, Africa, and most of Asia and Oceania, as well as Greenland.
* port marks are red and may have a red flashing light of any rhythm except 2+1.
* starboard marks are green and may have a green flashing light of any rhythm except 2+1.

=== Region B ===
* comprises the Americas, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan, Hawaii, and Easter Island.
* port marks are green and may have a green flashing light of any rhythm except 2+1
* starboard marks are red and may have a red flashing light of any rhythm except 2+1

=== Both regions ===

* port marks are square or have a flat top
* starboard marks are conical (or present a triangular shape) or have a pointed top.

The shape is an important feature, as colours cannot be distinguished in some light conditions, or by persons with red-green colour blindness. Marks may also carry unique markings of letters and numbers; these may be used to identify the mark as one indicated on a nautical chart. Likewise, a mark&#x27;s light may flash in a distinctive sequence for the same purpose.

When a channel divides, as for instance a channel to a smaller harbour off a main river, then a &quot;preferred channel&quot; or &quot;bifurcation&quot; mark is used. The mark has the same shape and main colour as a port- or starboard- hand mark for the main channel. It bears in addition a horizontal band with the appropriate colour for the smaller channel. For example: region A, main channel straight on, creek leading to marina to port. The buoy where the channels divide would be a red cylindrical can or pillar with a cylindrical top mark. Around the middle would be a green band. In IALA region B the shape would be identical, but the main colour would be green with a red band. See the buoy by the island in the diagram above.

In Region A only, the phrase &quot;Is there any red port left?&quot; (referring to the red colour of the fortified wine &quot;port&quot;) may be used as a mnemonic, indicating that a red mark must be kept on the left when &quot;returning&quot; to (i.e., entering) a harbour or river.

In Region B only, the phrase &quot;red right returning&quot; may be used as a mnemonic, indicating that a red mark must be kept on the right when &quot;returning&quot; to (&quot;i.e.&quot;, entering) a harbour or river.

<text>The Isle of Noss or Noss () is a small, previously inhabited island in Shetland, Scotland. Noss is separated from the island of Bressay by the narrow Noss Sound. It has been run as a sheep farm since 1900, and has been a national nature reserve since 1955.

Noss is popular for wildlife tourism, and is linked to Bressay by a seasonal ferry service, run by the wildlife wardens using an inflatable boat. The ferry service brings around 1700 to the island each year, whilst total annual visitor numbers are thought to be around 5000 once those visiting on private and commercial boats are included. Attractions on Noss include a visitor centre, the Pony Pund built to breed Shetland ponies, the Holm of Noss rock and the Noup cliff.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Noss&quot; comes from the Old Norse , meaning nose. The fact that the name given was &quot;nǫs&quot; and not &quot;nǫsøy&quot; (nose island) - as is the way most other islands of a similar size are named in Shetland - suggests that the island was originally a peninsula attached to the neighbouring Bressay, and that at some point between the arrival of the Vikings and the 16th century the isthmus joining it was washed away by the sea.

==History==
Noss had a population of 20 in 1851 but has had no permanent inhabitants since 1939. The main focus of settlement on Noss was around the low lying west side of the island at Gungstie (Old Norse: a landing place). Gungstie was built in the 1670s and is currently used by the seasonal wildlife wardens. Another settlement at Setter, on the south east of the island was inhabited until the 1870s and now lies derelict. Among the few families living on Noss were the Booth family headed by Joseph Booth (1765–1847). Genealogical records indicate that he was occupied as a farmer and fish curer. Records show that he was resident on Noss as early as 1834. The cliffs of the Noup of Noss (also known as the &#x27;Great Wall of Noss&#x27;) were first climbed by Jo Moran in 1963.

==Flora and fauna==
137 vascular plant species, 25 fungi and lichen species, 44 mosses and liverworts and 30 species of algae have been recorded at Noss. Two nationally scarce species of vascular plant, small adder&#x27;s-tongue and northern knotgrass are found here, as is the nationally scarce lichen &quot;Lecanora straminea&quot;.

Noss was designated a national nature reserve in 1955, and is managed by NatureScot. The island is renowned for its seabird colonies and is one of the more accessible of the internationally important seabird colonies in the North Atlantic. The sandstone cliffs of Noss have weathered into a series of horizontal ledges making ideal breeding grounds for gannets, puffins, guillemots, shags, black-legged kittiwakes, razorbills, northern fulmars and great skuas.

The species profile has changed considerably over the last 100 years, with dramatic increases in some species and population crashes in others. Four new species have begun to breed here (gannet, fulmar, great skua and storm petrel), however a further six species that were formerly recorded (lesser black-backed gull, common gull, tree sparrow, Eurasian whimbrel, peregrine falcon and white-tailed eagle) no longer breed at Noss. In total 201 bird species have been recorded: in addition to the many seabirds several species of waders also breed here, including dunlin, common snipe, oystercatcher and ringed plover. Other breeding bird species include skylark, meadow pipit, rock pipit and wheatear.

Otters are also frequently seen around the island, and grey and common seals are seen in small numbers. In total ten species of cetacean have been seen in the seas off Noss, of which the most commonly recorded is the harbour porpoise.

==Conservation designations==
The national nature reserve is classified as a Category IV protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Noss also holds other designations for its important wildlife being designated as a both a Special Protection Area (SPA) and a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The island has also been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International.

<text>The Brahman is an American breed of zebuine-taurine hybrid beef cattle. It was bred in the United States from 1885 using cattle originating in India, imported at various times from the United Kingdom, India, and Brazil. These were mainly Gir, Guzerá and Nelore stock, with some Indu-Brasil, Krishna Valley and Ongole. The Brahman has a high tolerance of heat, sunlight and humidity, and good resistance to parasites. It has been exported to many countries, particularly in the tropics; in Australia it is the most numerous breed of cattle. It has been used in the creation of numerous taurine-indicine hybrids, some of which – such as the Brangus and Brahmousin – are established as separate breeds.

== History ==

Zebuine (Asian humped) cattle were present in the United States from 1849, when a single bull of Indian origin was imported from the United Kingdom to South Carolina. In 1885 a pair of grey bulls was brought directly from India to Texas; one was large, weighing over , the other weighed little more than half that. Cross-breeding of these with local taurine cows was the first step in the creation of the Brahman breed. Other small groups of Indian cattle were imported up to about 1906, mostly to Texas; some of them were imported to be displayed as circus animals, and were later sold to ranchers. In 1924 and 1925 a total of 210 bulls and 18 cows of mainly zebuine-taurine hybrid Guzerá stock, but also including some Gir and Nelore, were brought from Brazil to the United States through Mexico. 

A breed association, the American Brahman Breeders Association, was formed in 1924, and a herd-book was started. The name &#x27;Brahman&#x27; was chosen by J. W. Sartwelle, secretary of the association. In 1939 the herd-book was closed, thereafter recording only the offspring of registered parents. The registration in 1946 of eighteen imported Brazilian bulls, mainly Indu-Brasil and Gir, was permitted, as were some later additions of imported stock. The association registered all American indicine cattle in the same herd-book until 1991, when herd-books for Gir, Guzerat, Indu-Brasil, Nelore and Tabapua were separated from that for the American Red and Grey Brahman.

Exports of cattle of this breed to Australia began in 1933 and continued until 1954, amounting to 49 head in all; by 1973 their offspring numbered more than . Some further imports, numbering about 700 head in total, took place after 1981. By 1987 there were over a million in Queensland alone, and by the end of the century there were more of them in Australia than of any other breed, particularly in the tropical north of the country.

The Brahman is reported from fifty-five countries, in all inhabited continents, with an estimated world population of over 1.8 million head. Populations of over are reported by Argentina, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Mozambique and South Africa. No population data for the United States has been reported since 2014, when there were just under head.

== Characteristics ==

The Brahman has good tolerance of heat and humidity, good resistance to insects, and good tolerance of poor feeding conditions. It has been found to do well in southern coastal areas of the United States. These characteristics may be transmitted to cross-breeds of Brahman with cattle of European origin, which can also benefit from heterosis (&#x27;hybrid vigor&#x27;).

== Use ==

The Brahman is reared for the meat industry, particularly in areas where good resistance to hot or tropical conditions is needed. As with other zebuine cattle, the meat is of lower quality than that of specialised European beef cattle breeds. For this reason it is commonly cross-bred with cattle of those breeds, either by raising hybrid calves born to pure-bred parents, or by creating a composite or hybrid breed, of which there are many. Some of them, such as the Brahmousin (Brahman x Limousin), Brangus (Brahman x Angus) and Simbrah (Brahman x Simmental) have acquired breed status in their own right, but many others have not. These include the Brahorn (Brahman x Shorthorn), the Bravon (Brahman x Devon) and South Bravon (Brahman x South Devon), the Bra-Swiss (Brahman x Brown Swiss), the Sabre (Brahman x Sussex) and the Braford (Brahman x Hereford).

In Oman and Fujairah, Brahman bulls are used in the traditional sport of bull-butting; they may be fed milk and honey to prepare them for the contest.

<text>Frank Edward Peretti (born January 13, 1951) is a &quot;New York Times&quot; best-selling author of Christian fiction, whose novels primarily focus on the supernatural and spiritual warfare. , his works have sold over 15 million copies worldwide. He has been described by &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; as creating the Christian thriller genre. Peretti is best known for his novels &quot;This Present Darkness&quot; (1986) and &quot;Piercing the Darkness&quot; (1989). Peretti has held ministry credentials with the Assemblies of God, and formerly played the banjo in a bluegrass band called Northern Cross. He now lives in Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho, with his wife, Barbara.

==Biography==
Frank E. Peretti was born in Lethbridge in southern Alberta, Canada, but raised in Seattle, Washington, for most of his life. As a child, he had a cystic hygroma, a facial tumor which affected his ability to speak until later receiving surgery and speech therapy. He became a natural storyteller who regularly told monster stories to neighborhood children. After graduating from high school, he began playing banjo with a local bluegrass group. He married his wife, Barbara, in 1972. Later, he studied English, screen writing and film at UCLA, and assisted his father in pastoring a small Assembly of God church on Vashon Island from 1978 to 1983, also taking construction jobs to make ends meet. While working as a pastor, teaching children at church camps &quot;rekindled his interest in storytelling&quot;.

==Writing==

===Early work===
After leaving pastoring and while working at a ski factory, Peretti wrote and published a well-received adventure story for children, &quot;The Door in the Dragon&#x27;s Throat&quot; (1985). A year later, he published &quot;This Present Darkness&quot; (1986), his most famous and popular novel to date. It was initially rejected by fourteen publishers before being picked up by Crossway Books. Although &quot;This Present Darkness&quot; was not an immediate success, sales improved with word of mouth, particularly after singer Amy Grant promoted the book. The book remained on the Christian Booksellers Association&#x27;s top ten best-sellers list for over 150 consecutive weeks, and has as of 2013 sold over 2.7 million copies worldwide.

Peretti followed &quot;This Present Darkness&quot; with a sequel, &quot;Piercing the Darkness&quot; (1989), another tremendous success. Combined, &quot;This Present Darkness&quot; and &quot;Piercing the Darkness&quot; have sold 3.5 million copies . , &quot;This Present Darkness&quot; continues to sell approximately 8,000 copies per year.

Peretti also took the characters from his first work &quot;The Door in the Dragon&#x27;s Throat&quot; and used them to write &quot;The Cooper Kids Adventure Series&quot;, releasing seven more titles that contained the same Indiana Jones-style adventures similar to &quot;The Door in the Dragon&#x27;s Throat&quot;.

Throughout the 1990s, Peretti continued to write full-time, releasing &quot;Prophet&quot; (1992), &quot;The Oath&quot; (1995), and &quot;The Visitation&quot; (1999). &quot;The Oath&quot;, generally regarded as one of Peretti&#x27;s greater works, has sold more than one million copies, and received the ECPA Gold Medallion Book Award for Best Fiction in 1996. &quot;The Visitation&quot; landed at #19 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list and was adapted into a film in 2006.

===Later years===
The turn of the millennium saw Peretti&#x27;s departure from writing his popular novels. He wrote a 2000 memoir, &quot;The Wounded Spirit&quot;, which covered his struggles as a child with a facial tumor, which caused him to be mocked by other children and retreat to solitude until it was eventually treated with multiple surgeries. He dwelled on the subject of bullying in his non-fiction titles &quot;No More Victims&quot; (2001) and &quot;No More Bullies&quot; (2003).

In 2001, Peretti released &quot;Hangman&#x27;s Curse&quot;, the first book in the &quot;Veritas Project&quot; series for teens. The book was an instant hit among both teens and adults, and was made into a low-budget 2003 film of the same name. The second book in the series, &quot;Nightmare Academy&quot;, was published in 2002 with equal success. The two books together sold more than 500,000 copies, according to Thomas Nelson Publishers. Peretti has mentioned that there may be more possible entries in the Veritas Project series.

Peretti&#x27;s first full-length novel after 2000 was the 2005 thriller &quot;Monster&quot;, which played with the Bigfoot legend and explored issues surrounding the &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; and creationist-based objections to evolution. &quot;Monster&quot; hit &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list at #34 on its first week and rose to #29 on its second week.

In April 2006, Peretti and fellow supernatural author Ted Dekker co-authored the novel &quot;House&quot;. It received mixed reviews from Peretti and Dekker fans, but was popular enough to be adapted as the 2008 film &quot;House&quot;, starring Michael Madsen.

In April 2010, it was announced that Peretti had signed with Howard Books (a division of Simon &amp; Schuster) for a new novel. The novel, &quot;Illusion&quot;, was published in March 2012.

=== Influence and themes ===
Peretti&#x27;s work, with its themes of spiritual warfare, has been described belonging to &quot;an older tradition of believers, including C. S. Lewis, John Bunyan, and John Milton (and before them, medieval and ancient apocalyptic writers), who depicted angels and humans at war.&quot;

Jay R. Howard summarizes the worldview underlying Peretti&#x27;s works:

The New Age movement is noted by Howard as &quot;the tie that binds the villains&quot; throughout Peretti&#x27;s novels. Peretti depicts New Age beliefs as promoting demonic activity and attempting to gain dominance while limiting Christianity. It is shown expanding through the education system – led by the US&#x27;s top university – and practitioners including environmentalists, government officials, and teachers. Public education is thus &quot;a battle ground for the confrontation of good and evil.&quot;

Marisa Ronan places Peretti&#x27;s works in the context of the American Century. &quot;Shaped by the politicization of evangelical concerns&quot; and focusing on a culture war against the backdrop of the Cold War, &quot;...at stake was Christianity&#x27;s, and thus America&#x27;s, hold on the twentieth century&quot;.

The theme of false sexual abuse allegations against Peretti&#x27;s protagonists by women and children – because they are possessed by demons – has been mentioned by several reviewers. One reviewer describes it as &quot;a terrible willingness to forgive child abuse and sexual assault if the accused was a powerful man and the accuser was a woman or child&quot; mirrored in American evangelicalism, while another notes that not only are all of the victims depicted as &quot;demonically-possessed liar[s]&quot;, but those in helping roles are also &quot;villains&quot;: &quot;Those who are on the frontline of helping children and survivors – public school teachers, therapists, social workers, child advocates – are cast as evil&quot;.

Another recurring theme in Peretti&#x27;s writings is the concept of a peaceful, simple life. Characters are described as living on quaint farms, living a simple, rural life, or living in small, community-focused towns. In one interview, Peretti noted that he believes Christians ought to &quot;live a quiet life, mind our own business, work with our own hands, and walk properly toward those outside.&quot;

==Filmography==
&quot;Tilly&quot;, a novella which started out as an audio drama produced by Focus on the Family and aired on August 10, 1987, was adapted into a forty-minute film by anti-abortion group Love Life America in 2002 and shown on both PAX TV and briefly on the EWTN show &quot;Defending Life&quot; before being released on DVD. It was directed by Stephen Vidano and produced by IMS Productions.

In 2004 &quot;Hangman&#x27;s Curse&quot; was made into a film, in which Peretti himself had a small role as an eccentric professor, Dr. Algernon Wheeling. It had a limited release in theaters but appears to have been successful enough to encourage film producers to continue developing Peretti&#x27;s books into films.

&quot;The Visitation&quot; was also made into a film by Twentieth Century Fox in 2006.

&quot;House&quot; was released in select theaters on November 7, 2008.

In addition to his appearance in &quot;Hangman&#x27;s Curse&quot;, Peretti has had a voice role in &quot;Flo, the Lying Fly&quot;, the second animated entry in the &quot;Hermie and Friends&quot; series for children. He has also made a number of videos (and associated audio tapes and books) in which he takes on the persona of Mr. Henry, a slightly eccentric inventor and Bible teacher.

==Critical reviews==
Peretti has been hailed as &quot;America&#x27;s hottest Christian novelist&quot; and has been called a &quot;sanctified Stephen King&quot; and &quot;the Stephen King of Christian fiction&quot;. In comparison to King, however, Peretti says, &quot;Stephen King doesn&#x27;t have any supernatural good guys. Usually the supernatural is evil, and it&#x27;s up to the humans to deal with it. In my books, I introduce a supernatural good to combat the supernatural evil. At least you&#x27;ve got a fighting chance.&quot;

He has received generally positive praise from many Christian book reviews, his books being heralded as telling entertaining stories with complex interwoven plots.

==Theological criticisms==
Peretti&#x27;s fictional portrayal of spiritual warfare reflects in part his background in the Assemblies of God and the contemporary focus of Neo-charismatic writings on the demonic. His concept of territorial spirits reigning over cities with the related spiritual mapping is paralleled in the Neo-charismatic world, including in non-fiction works in theology and missions by Charismatic writers such as C. Peter Wagner (and the related New Apostolic Reformation), Larry Lea, Ed Silvoso and Ed Murphy.

His books have been considered to reflect the New Christian Right. As his novels have been widely sold and read throughout Evangelical, Charismatic and Pentecostal churches, Peretti&#x27;s fiction has excited the imaginations of clergy and laity alike on the subject of spiritual warfare. Michael Maudlin of &quot;Christianity Today&quot; reports hearing that some readers have been so enthused they have declared that &quot;This Present Darkness&quot; is the best book ever written after the Bible. He has also described its theology as &quot;closer to primitive dualism than traditional Christian theism.&quot;

Some critical reservations have been expressed by a number of Evangelical and Pentecostal writers that many readers are using Peretti&#x27;s novels as manuals on prayer, exorcism, spiritual warfare and as guidebooks about dangers of the New Age movement. For example, Kim Riddlebarger expresses alarm that many readers have &quot;redefined their entire worldview based upon a novel&quot; and insists that the Bible does not call upon Christians to &quot;engage in spiritual warfare as a combat between angels and demons&quot;. Peretti has commented regarding this use of his work. His 1992 novel &quot;Prophet&quot; included a disclaimer stating &quot;This novel is a creative work of fiction imparting spiritual truth in a symbolic manner, and not an emphatic statement of religious doctrine&quot;, and upon publication of &quot;The Oath&quot; he stated, &quot;If you really want to study spiritual warfare, read the Bible. Don&#x27;t read my book.&quot;

Irving Hexham rejects Peretti&#x27;s depiction of the New Age as confirming a negative stereotype. Hexham observes that Peretti&#x27;s novels reflect the anxieties that many fundamentalist and evangelical Christians have about secular society, the mass media, the social sciences and tertiary education. He is also disturbed &quot;to see the way Frank Peretti has become a popular and oft-quoted authority on the New Age&quot; because &quot;his actual qualifications in religious matters are minimal&quot;. Andrew Connolly notes that &quot;these enemies, united under a New Age banner, are motivated not simply by an alternative religious ideology, but by demons&quot; in Peretti&#x27;s work.

== Impact ==
In addition to creating the Christian thriller genre, Peretti&#x27;s work has had a notable impact on Christian literature and culture. Phyllis Tickle, religion editor of &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, called Peretti &quot;the daddy, the king of, the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of the contemporary evangelical Christian fiction, if you cut out inspirational from that category.&quot; &quot;Christianity Today&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; have stated his work has led the way for later Christian fiction such as the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series, which authors Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins have acknowledged, as well as for fiction by Pat Robertson and Chuck Colson.

Connolly argues Peretti&#x27;s writing opened the door for other evangelical fiction that is gendered as masculine. Peretti &quot;truly is the initiator of the male evangelical Christian fiction&quot;, noted Tickle in 1995. Peretti has stated the Christian fiction market previously wanted &quot;prairie romance-type books&quot; and &quot;used to be very nonconfrontative – you know, the young woman struggling against the rigors of prairie life meets a fine young Christian minister.&quot;

The editor-in-chief of the publisher Crossway Books has described Peretti&#x27;s thrillers as being written for the Moral Majority, stating, &quot;there are 35 or 40 million people in this country who are really upset with the way things are. For once, their side is not beaten down. They win.&quot; While his thrillers deal with war between angels and demons, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; notes they also &quot;[explore] other issues such as curricula used in public schools and attempts by a thinly disguised version of the American Civil Liberties Union to shut down a Christian school by charging that corporal punishment constitutes child abuse.&quot; Historian Crawford Gribben argues Peretti&#x27;s work &quot;certainly set the terms for the re-energizing and even the remilitarization, of evangelicalism&quot;; others have noted his writings encourage readers to take political action.

Some scholars have argued that Peretti&#x27;s works, with their themes of spiritual warfare and conspiracies, have paved the way for evangelical acceptance of President Donald Trump. Daniel Silliman, professor of American religion and culture at Heidelberg University, asserts that Trump played off the types of fears among evangelical Christians found in Peretti&#x27;s books and later works inspired by him such as the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series. Theological studies professor André Gagné, who has written on the Christian dominionist movement the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), states that its founder C. Peter Wagner &quot;regarded Frank Peretti&#x27;s novels as the best illustration of actual spiritual warfare.&quot; Religious studies scholar Damon T. Berry argues that despite the books&#x27; fictional settings, the spiritual warfare and demonology presented – also seen in the NAR&#x27;s prophecies regarding Trump – are intended to be true-to-life. QAnon, with its messianic spiritual warfare overtones, has been connected to &quot;the same culture previously captivated and emboldened&quot; by Peretti&#x27;s novels such as the &quot;Darkness&quot; series.

Peretti&#x27;s books have been translated to dozens of languages, among them Chinese, Croatian, French, German, Hungarian, Norwegian, Polish, Russian and Swedish.

<text>The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc. (usually known as SCO, pronounced either as individual letters or as a word) was an American software company, based in Santa Cruz, California, that was best known for selling three Unix operating system variants for Intel x86 processors: Xenix, SCO UNIX (later known as SCO OpenDesktop and SCO OpenServer), and UnixWare.

SCO was founded in 1979 by Larry Michels and his son Doug Michels and began as a consulting and Unix porting company. An early involvement with Microsoft led to SCO making a product out of Xenix on Intel-based PCs. The fundamental insight that led to SCO&#x27;s success was that there was a large market for a standard, &quot;open systems&quot; operating system on commodity microprocessor hardware that would give business applications computing power and throughput that previously was only possible with considerably more expensive minicomputers. SCO built a large community of value-added resellers that would eventually become 15,000 strong and many of its sales to small and medium-sized businesses went through those resellers. This community was exemplified by the annual SCO Forum conference, held in a scenic setting that reflected the company&#x27;s Santa Cruz culture. SCO also had corporate customers in the replicated sites space, where a SCO-based system was deployed in each of a retail or restaurant chain&#x27;s stores.

Despite seeing rapid growth in terms of revenues, SCO tended to have high research and development costs and was never consistently profitable either before or after going public in 1993. SCO bought two former Xenix outfits, the Software Products Group within Logica in 1986 and HCR Corporation in 1990, thereby gaining development offices in Watford, England and Toronto, Canada. During the mid-1990s, SCO acquired two further UK companies, IXI Limited in Cambridge and Visionware in Leeds, which led to a suite of client-to-Unix integration products and then the Tarantella product line. SCO&#x27;s operating system technology moved from Xenix to System V Release 3 as reflected by the products SCO Open Desktop and SCO OpenServer. In 1995, SCO bought the System V Release 4 and UnixWare business from Novell and, in collaboration with several hardware partners, the New Jersey development office it gained in the deal led a series of enhancements to the UnixWare product aimed at the high-end enterprise and data center spaces.

Beginning in the late 1990s, SCO faced increasingly severe competitive pressure, on one side from Microsoft&#x27;s Windows NT and its successors and on the other side from the free and open source Linux. In 2001, the Santa Cruz Operation sold its rights to Unix and its Unix divisions to Caldera Systems. After that the corporation retained only its Tarantella product line, and changed its name to Tarantella, Inc. Caldera Systems became Caldera International and then changed its name to The SCO Group, which has created some confusion between the two companies. The company described here is the original Santa Cruz Operation. Although generally referred to simply as &quot;SCO&quot; up to 2001, it is now sometimes referred to as &quot;old SCO&quot;, &quot;Santa Cruz&quot;, or &quot;SCO Classic&quot; to distinguish it from &quot;The SCO Group&quot; to whom the U.S. trademark &quot;SCO&quot; was transferred.

== Early history ==

=== Origin ===
SCO was founded in 1979 in Santa Cruz, California, by Larry Michels and his son Doug Michels as a computer consulting company that focused on both technology and management considerations. Larry Michels, 48 years old at the time, was an electrical engineer who had gone into the aerospace industry in Los Angeles. He had then founded a credit verification company, Credifier Corporation, which he sold to TRW Inc., for whom he subsequently served as a vice president for ten years. (Larry Michels was first cousin of another technology entrepreneur, Allen Michels.) Towards the end of that time, Michels became head of the Advanced Products Laboratory for TRW Electronics, and relocated to Santa Cruz to run it remotely from there.

As part of this, Michels was involved with a telephony business, TRW Vidar. This was a company, based in Mountain View, California, that TRW had acquired and that was a part of TRW Electronics. TRW Vidar was a pioneer in digital telephone switches, and also an early user of Version 6 Unix in its development environment. Michels felt that TRW as a whole did not understand the rapid change that computers were bringing to businesses or what it had with Vidar – &quot;They thought they were buying a telephony business, they thought that telephony was telephony, but they really were computers. Unless you approached them as being computers, you didn&#x27;t end up with anything.&quot; He then left TRW to do management consulting work, thinking, as he later said, that &quot;if TRW was having so much trouble, it was probably an interesting business [helping companies] go about making these transitions.&quot; As a result of this connection, some have considered The Santa Cruz Operation to have been an offshoot of TRW Vidar.

Doug Michels, 25 years old at the time, had graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1976 with a degree from their department of computer and information science. He had then started his own consulting operation, focusing on technical work.

The two saw some commonalities in their consulting endeavors and decided to join forces to reduce overhead. They chose to stay in Santa Cruz both because of the relaxed lifestyle there and because the university would provide a ready supply of technically suitable employees. By some sources The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc. was incorporated in January 1979. The name came from Larry Michels&#x27; time as head of the TRW advanced research group, when the remote outpost had been known as &#x27;the Santa Cruz operation&#x27;. The Michelses decided to use that for the name of their new firm, and the name was retained in the years that would follow because it told people where they were coming from.

=== Unix porting company ===
Offices for the new firm were established at 500 Chestnut Street in the downtown area of Santa Cruz. But as Doug Michels conceded in a 2006 interview, in terms of what they would be doing, &quot;We didn&#x27;t really have an idea.&quot; Pure consulting work held little ongoing appeal, and the notion of helping large businesses manage rapid technological change proved difficult in practice.

However, the Michelses soon became intrigued by the microprocessor revolution then underway, in which computer systems based on processors such as the Intel 8080 or the Zilog Z80 could be put together much quicker than the minicomputers of the past. In the consulting work they did, SCO was dealing with various resellers and small time-sharing companies in helping those companies formulate their technology strategies. The people at SCO had, and further acquired, a familiarity with the Unix operating system and its potential for use in the business world. By early 1981, SCO was selling a report analyzing Unix features and availability based on a poll it had taken of over sixty members of the /usr/group association.

Moreover, people at SCO realized that since Unix was portable and not controlled by any hardware manufacturer, use of it could allow microprocessor-based system manufacturers to avoid having to develop a proprietary operating system of their own, which they had neither the time nor the expertise to do. Accordingly, the company decided to focus on custom jobs of porting the Unix system and applications that ran on it. Eric S. Raymond, in his book &quot;The Art of Unix Programming&quot; (which places the start of SCO in 1978), calls SCO the &quot;first Unix company&quot;, although Interactive Systems Corporation, which put out the first commercial Unix release (as a base for office automation systems) in 1977, perhaps has a stronger case.

The first Unix-based operating system that SCO made is for the PDP-11, is named DYNIX (not to be confused with a same-named Unix variant later made by Sequent Computer Systems), and is based on Seventh Edition Unix. It supports the Tymshare service and by early 1981 was included in Tymshare&#x27;s DYNASTY computer system offering. SCO also did a Unix port to the LSI-11 variant of the PDP-11.

Xenix is a Seventh Edition Unix-based version of the operating system that Microsoft worked on, initially for the PDP-11. SCO first began working with Xenix in 1981. In 1982, Microsoft and SCO forged a joint agreement for development and technology exchange, with the two companies&#x27; engineers working together on improvements to Xenix. (Microsoft was still a small company at the time, with perhaps 25 or 50 employees.) Microsoft and SCO then further engaged Human Computing Resources in Canada, and the Software Products Group within Logica in the United Kingdom, as part of making further improvements to Xenix and porting Xenix to other platforms. In doing so, Microsoft gave HCR and Logica the rights to do Xenix ports and license Xenix binaries in those territories.

In 1983, SCO made a technically difficult port of Xenix to the &quot;unmapped&quot; Intel 8086 processor (earlier 8086 Xenix ports required an off-chip MMU) and licensed rights from Microsoft to be able to ship its packaged Unix system, Xenix, for the IBM PC XT. This work takes advantage of earlier porting and compilers work that Altos Computer Systems had done for the mapped 16-bit Intel architecture. The resulting system is binary compatible with, and can run applications built for, Altos Xenix systems, and was a successful venture for SCO.
Somewhat in parallel with that, SCO and Microsoft also developed the 68000-based Xenix port for the Apple Lisa. It has multiuser capability as well as support for virtual terminals for single users. SCO also sold applications for Xenix on Lisa, including a Uniplex word processor, the Multiplan spreadsheet from Microsoft, Level II COBOL from Micro Focus, and the Informix database software from Relational Database Systems. While the Lisa was not a success in the personal computer marketplace, its powerful-for-its-price-point processor combined with a relatively inexpensive operating system gave third-party vendors an attractive platform for building systems to compete with minicomputers, and SCO sold several thousand copies of Xenix for the Lisa. This was the first shrink-wrapped binary product sold by SCO, and its sales convinced SCO of the potential of that kind of product.

A third target of SCO&#x27;s Xenix porting work was the DEC Professional 350. As Larry Michels said in early 1984, &quot;SCO will continue offering custom XENIX adaptions to the large OEM market – the Original Equipment Manufacturers – who make up SCO&#x27;s established customer base.&quot; SCO also sold Unix training.

By September 1983, SCO had around 60 employees and was already expanding into a second office, at 1700 Mission Street in Santa Cruz. While some of SCO&#x27;s staff had studied computer science, others were coming from backgrounds in linguistics, sociology, psychology, or business.

In early 1984, Microsoft and SCO issued a joint announcement about SCO&#x27;s rights to distribute Xenix within the United States. SCO Xenix for the PC XT shipped sometime in 1984 and contains some enhancements from 4.2BSD Unix, Micnet local area networking, and multiuser support. In 1985, SCO worked with AT&amp;T and Microsoft to test conformance with the System V Interface Definition (SVID), one of the early Unix standardization efforts.

In October 1985, SCO announced the availability of Xenix System V for the Intel 8088-based IBM PC XT and the Intel 80286-based IBM PC AT and IBM PC XT. The product can support ten remote users via serial ports and was sold with optional packages for software development in C or assembly language and for text processing. There had been concern within SCO about the business chances of the 80286 product, since IBM had elected to come to market with their own Unix. But that IBM effort, contracted to Interactive Systems Corporation and called PC/IX, resulted in a product that was unsuccessful.

There had been considerable skepticism in the industry that Unix could ever establish a successful market position on the PC. These included beliefs that Unix was inherently large and complex enough that it needed a minicomputer, the platform on which it had been developed, in order to run effectively. As Larry Michels said in early January 1991, &quot;We had all the problems of being ahead of the market.&quot; The company had never been adequately funded, as venture capitalists were unenthused by the idea of Unix on a PC; cash flow problems resulted and the Michelses used much of their personal savings to keep the company in business. A key turning point was when Compaq Computer began shipping systems with Unix installed and chose SCO to be their provider.

Larry Michels tended to focus on the business aspects of the company while Doug Michels focused on technology facets; together they became recognized as pioneers of the Unix-on-PC industry. Larry Michels was president of SCO and Doug Michels was, as Larry put it, &quot;the number-two person&quot;, usually with the title of executive vice-president, but both employees and outside investors were encouraged to treat the two as an indivisible team.

In December 1986, SCO acquired the Software Products Group division of Logica. It became a wholly owned subsidiary, the Santa Cruz Operation Limited, and the basis for SCO&#x27;s UK operation, with its office subsequently being relocated first to Soho and then to Watford outside London. By 1993, almost half of SCO&#x27;s revenues came from outside North America, and of that, almost half came from the United Kingdom.

In 1987, the company brought out the SCO Xenix 386 Toolkit, which allowed developers to start coding applications and device drivers for the new Intel 80386 processor in addition to the existing 80286. Later that year, SCO&#x27;s full release of Xenix for 80386 was made; the chip was powerful enough that Xenix running on it could handle some 30 different users. SCO provided some basic applications with Xenix. But the real value came from the 1,700 other applications that had been developed by value-added resellers (VARs) and independent software vendors (ISVs) for the platform, including such domains as auto parts management, medical accounting, bakery process control, and many others. As one retrospective look characterized it, Xenix served &quot;as a workhorse for small businesses – places where you might find a dozen or so dumb terminals and a couple of printers plugged into a system running [a] small database system. It&#x27;s simple, small and stable.&quot;

By early 1987, SCO had relocated its offices to a building at 400 Encinal Street in an industrial park in the Harvey West area of Santa Cruz (the building had been previously occupied by Intel). As of a year later, SCO employed some 500 people, mostly in Santa Cruz, and had plans to build a new office building there. By early 1991, that new building, 425 Encinal Street, was holding an open house event for prospective employees. The company subsequently established offices in several other buildings in the Harvey West area. These included 324 Encinal Street, 150 Dubois Street, and 100 Pioneer Street.

By the late 1980s, fed by strong computer science program that emphasized Unix design and a robust internship program at SCO, some 50 to 60 percent of SCO employees were UC Santa Cruz graduates. SCO now employed some 800 people overall, mostly in its Santa Cruz offices but also in the UK office and in one in Washington, D.C. By early 1989, SCO had sold some 350,000 copies of Xenix in total, mostly through its channel. The company was achieving what the &quot;Santa Cruz Sentinel&quot; termed &quot;explosive growth&quot;.

SCO would subsequently reorient its product on a later technology base. However Xenix comprised the largest installed base of any of the early commercial variants of Unix; it remained a good seller among some customers and SCO releases of Xenix continued until Xenix/386 version 2.3.4 was put out in 1991.

===Relations with Microsoft===
Microsoft&#x27;s level of commitment to Xenix was always viewed with some suspicion within the industry. It later became clear that by the mid-1980s, Microsoft was losing interest in Xenix from their own business perspective, both due to the cost of licensing it from AT&amp;T and because MS-DOS was rapidly taking off as a product. 

In February 1989, it was announced that Microsoft was taking a minority investment in SCO by buying an amount less than 20 percent of that company. The terms of the agreement, which were not publicly disclosed, provided SCO with funds that it acutely needed in order to continue to expand in its rapidly growing market. The deal put a Microsoft executive on SCO&#x27;s board of directors; that executive, Microsoft&#x27;s chief financial officer Frank Gaudette, would play an important role in guiding SCO to become a mature enterprise. The deal contained provisions to prevent Microsoft from exercising dominant control over the smaller SCO. By some accounts, the Microsoft board member often had to be asked to leave discussions when the topic became how SCO could best compete with Microsoft. Already on the board since 1987 was another Microsoft veteran, Jim Harris, who had been a leader of Microsoft&#x27;s OEM sales efforts.
 
Microsoft&#x27;s motivation for the purchase has been variously explained as a desire to keep a Xenix technology partner, as a hedge against the growth of Unix, and as a hedge against the Open Software Foundation. Yet another explanation was the one given by Larry Michels in 1991, making reference to the SCO Unix product then being sold: &quot;The paradox is if you were Microsoft, Open Desktop isn&#x27;t something you want to see succeed. But if it doesn&#x27;t, something else will, and they would rather see Open Desktop than whatever that would be. We pay them royalties.&quot;

Later figures stating the amount that Microsoft actually owned included 16 percent, 14 percent, and 11 percent. Microsoft did not fully exit its position in SCO until 2000.

In any case, intellectual property rights were not transferred in the 1989 agreement and SCO would continue to pay Microsoft royalties for Xenix and Unix technologies. Not until 1997 was SCO able to reach an agreement with Microsoft that relieved SCO of the obligation to include Microsoft code, and pay royalties on that code regardless of whether it was used or not, in SCO products. And that only came after SCO filed a complaint against Microsoft for violating European Union competition law, a complaint that was ruled valid by the European Commission.

=== SCO UNIX and Open Desktop===
Needing to create a product from a more recent branch from the Unix family tree, Unix System V Release 3, SCO, together with Microsoft and Interactive Systems Corporation, worked during 1987 and 1988 to develop the System V/386 Release 3.2 version, which adds the ability to run existing Xenix binary applications on System V without requiring recompilation. This capability makes use of the new Intel Binary Compatibility Standard (iBCS), developed by Intel, AT&amp;T, and SCO. The AT&amp;T release of System V/386 Release 3.2 was announced at SCO Forum in 1988, but further work was needed by SCO to incorporate Xenix device drivers before SCO could release it as a product.

SCO UNIX, full name SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2.0, had first customer ship in June 1989; this became the basis for commercial successor to SCO Xenix. Based on an agreement forged with AT&amp;T the previous year, it was also the first SCO operating system to carry the &#x27;Unix&#x27; word itself in the product name.
In early 1990, the integrated product SCO Open Desktop began shipping. It features on top of SCO UNIX System V/386 several critical functionalities: a graphical user interface based on the X Window System and Open Software Foundation Motif toolkit; TCP/IP networking; support for the NFS network file system and OS/2 LAN Manager; database support; and Merge 386 for running DOS-based applications. Regarding OSF Motif, this is its first appearance in a commercial product, and Open Desktop became the first graphical Unix for an Intel 32-bit processor that was packaged in shrink-wrapped form.

SCO used technology partners for much of this work. The graphical desktop itself is the X.desktop one from IXI Limited; The TCP/IP networking stack and NFS implementation come from Lachman Associates, while Open Systems Interconnection software comes from Retix, Inc. The relational database manager included is Ingres. The Merge functionality comes from Locus Computing Corporation.

Version 3.2.2 of SCO Unix and Open Desktop came out in mid-1990; it contains various fixes and improvements for problems found in the field. However, Open Desktop did not make inroads on the personal computer market, as SCO Unix&#x27;s system resource requirements were strenuous and there were few commonly used PC applications available for it.

Beginning in the late 1980s, AT&amp;T and Sun Microsystems worked on a merge of Xenix, BSD, SunOS, and System V Release 3 features, with the result being known as UNIX System V Release 4. SCO UNIX and Open Desktop remained based on System V Release 3, but eventually added home-grown versions of a number of the features of Release 4.

Initially supplemented by some engineers who transferred from SCO&#x27;s headquarters operation in Santa Cruz, the ex-Logica group in Watford became one of the major development sites for SCO and over the next few years did the operating system kernel development work behind the subsequent SCO OpenDesktop and SCO OpenServer product releases. It later did engineering work in networking, security, escalations, and other areas, in addition to being the sales, marketing, and customer engineering hub for SCO&#x27;s EMEA region.

SCO acquired the Toronto, Canada-based HCR Corporation in 1990. Since their interactions in the early Xenix days, HCR had become Canada&#x27;s leading commercial Unix platform developer. The HCR acquisition allowed SCO to improve its development tools offerings, especially for Open Desktop. SCO Canada took over work on the Microsoft C compiler that dates back to Xenix days but can produce binaries for either Xenix or Unix. In addition, the SCO Open Desktop Development System also offers the AT&amp;T pcc compiler, here called rcc, but it can only compile for Unix. SCO Canada continued to sell HCR&#x27;s Cfront-based C++ product, which by 1991 had an estimated 450 licensed sites using it. The Toronto site also took on some porting and integration work.

SCO had a large technical publications operation at this time, with substantial staffing in each of the Santa Cruz, Toronto, and Watford offices, who as a group published on the order of 30,000 pages of documentation on a 18-month release cycle. One of the tech writers at Watford from 1991 to 1995 was science-fiction author Charles Stross, and his experiences in that office would provide some of the setting for his 2000s work &quot;The Atrocity Archives&quot;.

Collectively, Xenix and SCO UNIX became the most installed flavor of Unix due to the popularity of the x86 architecture. Hardware manufacturers that manufactured Intel-based systems and that resold a SCO operating system on it included not just Compaq but also DEC, Tandy Computers, Siemens Nixdorf, Olivetti, Unisys, and Hewlett-Packard. Especially significant were those systems with multiprocessor capability, such as the Compaq SystemPro, for which the SCO MPX multiprocessor extension to SCO UNIX had been delivered in 1990 based on development work that SCO did in conjunction with the firm Corollary, Inc. This effort produced the first version of Unix to support the symmetric multiprocessing capability of Compaq&#x27;s.

The primary market segment for SCO Unix was small businesses, such as real estate offices or florists to take two examples, where specialized dealers who were familiar with a particular application domain built or assembled customized software for that domain and then sold that as a turnkey solution to the business. SCO Unix was also used by chains such as Radio Shack and Taco Bell.

SCO capitalized on the increasingly prevalent &quot;open systems&quot; movement of the time, which held that a combination of interoperability, portability, and open software standards should result in computer users should not being locked into any one computer company&#x27;s product. Moreover, Doug Michels became an effective and convincing advocate for the open systems idea. The premise in SCO&#x27;s case was that an industry standard operating system for industry standard hardware – capable of handling the kind of multi-tasking, multi-user workload that MS-DOS could not – would give customers a compelling offering that previously was thought only possible with considerably more expensive minicomputers. By early 1991, &quot;The New York Times&quot; was publishing a profile of SCO based around the notion that it might become &quot;the next Microsoft&quot;.

===Applications and SCO Office Portfolio===
While SCO operating systems were often the basis of vertical market software offerings by others, SCO had long desired to create additional horizontal market software applications for its operating system product as part of further popularizing it. Thus SCO had provided some basic applications with Xenix, including database, graphics, a word processor, and a spreadsheet.

In 1988, these applications were bundled together as part of an offering known as SCO Office Portfolio, which serves as an integrated environment for office automation on Xenix, SCO Unix, and SCO Open Desktop. The portfolio primarily comprises SCO Lyrix, a word processor; SCO Professional, a spreadsheet; and SCO Integra, an SQL-based relational database. The first two were developed by SCO, while SCO Integra is based on an SQL engine from Coromandel Industries augmented by a 4GL called Accell from Unify Corporation.

Linking them together was the SCO Manager, which has a character-based but multi-windowed interface. It provides desktop tools such as mail, calendaring, and chat; an expandable menu system; and a clipboard mechanism for transmitting information between applications. The system administration interface for SCO Unix itself also adopted the Portfolio Manager interface.

Early 1990 also saw the release of Microsoft Word version 5.0 for Xenix and SCO Unix, which was also available as part of SCO Office Portfolio. It has functionality equivalent to Word for DOS, and was marketed to government agencies and other organizations running multiuser office systems. This was followed in early 1991 by Word 5.1 for SCO Unix, which has graphical user interface support. As part of adapting Word to Unix, SCO made various enhancements for multiuser support and workgroup-related features.

SCO had visions of selling its applications on platforms other than its own. In late 1988, SCO and Sun Microsystems announced that SCO Office Portfolio would be ported to Sun-3 workstations running SunOS. And in mid-1990, SCO made its Word for Unix available for AT&amp;T 3B2 and AT&amp;T 6386 systems.

One of the offerings in the SCO Office Portfolio was SCO FoxBase+, a version of FoxBase that is explicitly purposed as a look-alike to the popular dBase III database software for MS-DOS. And even SCO&#x27;s advertisements had called SCO Professional a &quot;workalike&quot; of the popular Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet. This resulted in problems when, in July 1990, Lotus Development Corporation sued SCO for copyright infringement, as one of several such actions that Lotus took against its imitators and competitors. The suit was settled out of court a year later; in a victory for Lotus, SCO agreed to stop all sales and licensing of SCO Professional and instead recommend that customers use 1-2-3.

In the end, SCO had neither the market share nor the sales ability to compete on applications with the major players in that area such as Microsoft and Lotus. Accordingly, staffing level and expenses for application work were sharply reduced in 1991, and again in 1993–94. The final version of Microsoft Word for SCO Unix, for instance, was 5.1.1; it was eventually withdrawn as a product by SCO in 1996.

===ACE and near insolvency===
Besides Microsoft, venture capitalists owned about 20 percent of SCO by 1991, meaning that the Michelses owned a majority of the company, although by 1993 the Michelses&#x27; share was stated as being about one-third. These venture capital firms included Morgan Stanley, Accel Partners, Chancellor Capital, and Wolfensohn &amp; Company.
During the late 1980s and early 1990s, analysts said that, given its revenue SCO should be more profitable than it was. Indeed, SCO had never been able to show profits on a consistent basis; through the end of fiscal 1991 SCO had accumulated a total loss of $31 million over its entire existence. SCO had high staffing levels, with for instance the $106 million revenue for 1990 going along with 1,300 employees, which was twice the level a typical software company of its era would have had. One analyst said that SCO &quot;is run like a university, a family-run university, not a company.&quot; Commenting on the company&#x27;s efforts to write applications for Unix themselves, another analyst said &quot;It&#x27;s a company that attacks in all directions.&quot; In part due to this kind of criticism, the Michelses said in late 1990 that they saw significant downsides to going public and preferred to remain private. One former employee recalled that Larry Michels &quot;ran SCO like it was a downhill skier racing out of control. He liked to think the company was literally like that – the fastest guy was always a little bit out of control. SCO was always a little out of control.&quot;

The late 1980s saw considerable interest in RISC-based processor architectures in comparison to Intel&#x27;s existing CISC-based approach, and there was particular interest in the R3000 and R4000 processors from MIPS Computer Systems. Major hardware vendors such as Digital Equipment Corporation were switching over to RISC-based systems.

In April 1991, the Advanced Computing Environment initiative was announced. There were a number of companies involved, but in term of the major players, it consisted of Compaq, Microsoft, MIPS Computer Systems, DEC and the Santa Cruz Operation. It had the goal of building the next generation commodity computing platform around the MIPS processor. Microsoft&#x27;s role was to supply a version of OS/2 for the processor (this OS/2 version would become the basis of Windows NT). SCO&#x27;s job was to supply the Unix operating system for the processor. The work consisted of taking DEC&#x27;s OSF/1 variant of Unix as one starting point, SCO&#x27;s Open Desktop as another, and adding in elements of DEC&#x27;s previous Ultrix flavor, to produce a Unix for the ACE platform. SCO created a top-level business unit within the company to focus on the ACE work and the expected market resulting from it.

But almost from the beginning, the ACE consortium was challenged by the difficulty of large, powerful companies with disparate interests working together; one German executive from a non-member company called ACE an &quot;eier-legende Wollmilchsau&quot; (egg-laying woolen milk pig). By November 1991, SCO&#x27;s work was reported as six months behind schedule. At the same time, indications were reported in trade media, the business press, and the general press that the ACE project as a whole was in trouble. In April 1992, a year after the start, the project fell apart; SCO publicly acknowledged that it had abandoned work on the Unix for MIPS and had withdrawn from the consortium, no longer confident that the project would succeed or was even necessary given improvements in CISC processor speed from Intel. Compaq withdrew as well, and MIPS Computer Systems was in the middle of being bought out. Only some of the heavy engineering expenditures that SCO had spent on ACE were recoverable; Larry Michels said, &quot;We learned a lot out of ACE. We learned the hard way.&quot;

As a whole during this period, SCO&#x27;s expenses were too high and the company was undercapitalized. And by several accounts, during 1991 the company came close to becoming bankrupt. The year saw a large-scale reduction in staffing levels from that peak of 1,300 – with around 12 percent of the workforce being let go across two rounds of layoffs – together with a company-wide reorganization that involved new managers being brought in from other technology companies. Especially targeted for elimination were the projects to build applications for Unix.

Following these changes, SCO showed a profit during its fiscal 1992 and the first half of its fiscal 1993.
In 1992, &quot;Software Magazine&quot; wrote that SCO had long been &quot;the only major player in this market,&quot; but noted that Univel and SunSoft were both introducing Unix-on-Intel products. Both of these were from better-financed companies.
But the sales of UnixWare 1.0 turned out to be modest, and SCO&#x27;s share of the Unix-on-Intel market was around 65 percent in mid-1993. For 1993 overall, SCO sold around 185,000 copies of its Unix product, while Novell (which acquired Univel) sold around 35,000 of UnixWare and Sun&#x27;s sales of Solaris-on-Intel were insignificant. &quot;PC Magazine&quot;, in a lengthy review the following year of different operating system choices for the Intel architecture, wrote that SCO had a dominant position in the Unix-on-Intel market. The magazine added that with its &quot;Tyrannosaurus Rex&quot;-like presence and more than 3,000 applications available, independent software vendors interested in Unix on PCs invariably made products that were SCO Unix-conformant.

=== Going public ===
By the summer of 1992, it was clear that SCO was intending to go public in the near future, and a number of investment bankers, brokers, and analysts attended that year&#x27;s SCO Forum conference with that possibility in mind. Larry Michels now viewed becoming a public company as crucial, as it would give SCO greater access to investment capital and because it would make SCO a more credible vendor to large corporations. There was also a desire to let employees benefit from the stock options they held. At the same time, Michels had become prominent in the local business scene in Santa Cruz County, arguing that the area had to be more aggressive about fostering economic development. At one point he asked SCO employees to attend a public hearing in support of a controversial plan for an outlet mall in which he was an investor. He was also a sponsor of several charitable events and philanthropies in the Santa Cruz area.

On December 5, 1992, the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; broke the story that three former executive secretaries at SCO had filed a lawsuit two days earlier against Larry Michels and SCO for sexual harassment. The suit, which named the women involved and was filed in Santa Cruz County Superior Court, stated that Michels had, on repeated occasions, propositioned or groped the women and had forced them into kissing him at work. In charging a sexually-hostile work environment, the women characterized Michels&#x27; behavior as &quot;oppressive, demeaning, sexually belittling, intimidating, exploitive and abusive.&quot; When one of the women had complained about Michels to the human resources department, she said she was told &quot;that&#x27;s just Larry, being Larry,&quot; and that the onus was on her to come up with a proposal on how she should be treated and present it to Michels. One of the women had been fired, another had quit her job, and the third had been transferred to another position after filing a complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing.

When asked for his reaction by a reporter, Michels denied the allegations in the suit and said, &quot;Did it say I raped anybody? Did it say I pinned anybody down?&quot; In response to the accusations hugging and kissing the women against their will at work, Michels said, &quot;How serious a crime is that?&quot; And asked if he regretted any of his actions, he said &quot;I certainly regret that I hired those three girls.&quot; On December 15, a fourth-named former executive secretary joined the lawsuit, saying among other allegations that Michels had taken her to a remote wooded property he owned and tried to force himself on her and that she ran away for fear of being raped. Public attention to sexual harassment had increased following the previous year&#x27;s Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings, and complaints had been filed with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing against other high-level male executives at SCO as well. On December 16 the board of directors of SCO announced that it had appointment one of its members, Jim Harris, to investigate the situation at SCO and that the board was &quot;extremely distressed by the recent allegations made against the company and its president.&quot;

On December 21, 1992, less than three weeks after initial lawsuit was filed, Larry Michels resigned as chief executive of SCO. Harris became interim president of the company. The rapid sequence of events triggered what the &quot;Santa Cruz Sentinel&quot; termed a period of &quot;internal turmoil and depression&quot; within the organization.

A month later, Lars Turndal took over as president and chief executive officer of SCO. Turndal, originally from Sweden, had overseen the large growth in SCO&#x27;s European operation over the preceding six years. Harris became chairman of the board, while Doug Michels remained executive vice president and also became chief technical officer. Programs begun by Harris, and continued by Turndal, sought to introduce to the company externally-provided classes in cultural sensitivity and to establish an internal diversity council.

In early April 1993, the sexual harassment suit was settled out of court, with the four women being awarded a total of $1.25 million. At the same time, SCO filed the necessary papers with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to go public. Prosecutors in Santa Cruz County considered whether criminal charges should be filed against Larry Michels but after a two-month investigation decided not to. Michels received a $354,000 &quot;golden handshake&quot; from SCO, which brought some criticism from employment rights&#x27; advocates. (Michels never returned to the company, although he kept in touch with what was going on via his son, and died of a stroke in 1999.)

The initial public offering for The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc. took place on May 27, 1993. The stock traded on NASDAQ under the symbol SCOC. The stock&#x27;s offering price was 12 and it closed at 12, meaning that it did not have the first-day jump that &quot;hot&quot; IPOs are expected to show.

The firm&#x27;s initial stretch as a public company was difficult. Two important board members, Harris and Microsoft&#x27;s Gaudette, died during 1993, with Turndal succeeding Harris as chairman. By year&#x27;s end the stock price was around 6, or half what it had started at.

The transitions of this period marked the change in SCO from being an entrepreneur-driven company to one driven by the need to behave in a more business-like manner and show steady profits. Turndal further jettisoned unprofitable applications and focused on SCO&#x27;s core Unix business as well as middleware additions to strengthen the platform. In December 1994, Turndal was made chair of the board as well as CEO, while Alok Mohan was elevated to president and chief operating officer.

With its first release in mid-1993, Microsoft&#x27;s server operating system Windows NT became a looming threat to the Unix-on-Intel market. SCO had even more commercial competitors in the Unix-on-Intel space, including NCR, IBM, Sequent, SunSoft&#x27;s Solaris, and Novell&#x27;s UnixWare, and each of these is based on SVR4. SCO was the only Unix-on-Intel vendor basing their product on SVR3.2. But there were many applications available for OpenServer, in part the result of SCO having forged many partnerships with other computer companies. Over half of all SCO sales were through VARs, who typically used SCO as the basis for an end-user application and then bundled the hardware, operating system, and application as a turnkey solution.

By the mid-1990s, SCO Unix in all its product releases had an installed base of a million systems sold. SCO OpenServer had a foothold in the corporate world as well; the 1997 edition of the book &quot;UNIX Unleashed&quot; wrote that &quot;It is very popular among corporate internets/intranets and has been for many years.&quot; The book added that &quot;Its technical support cannot be matched, which is why many corporations choose this commercial OS as their server OS of choice.&quot;

===PizzaNet, SCO Global Access, first Internet concert===
SCO also recognized the importance of the Internet. In August 1994, SCO and Pizza Hut announced PizzaNet, a pilot program in the Santa Cruz area that allowed consumers to use their own computer to order pizza delivery from a local Pizza Hut restaurant, with connection being made over the Internet to a central Pizza Hut server in Wichita, Kansas. The PizzaNet application software was developed by SCO&#x27;s Professional Services group.

PizzaNet was based on the first commercially licensed and bundled Internet operating system, SCO Global Access. SCO was the first commercial Unix system supplier to license the powerful NCSA Mosaic hypertext browser and NCSA HTTPd, and the first to ship these technologies from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign bundled with an operating system for commercial use.

On August 23, 1994, SCO broadcast a live music concert from the UC Santa Cruz&#x27;s Cowell Courtyard. This event, part of SCO Forum 1994, is said to be the first time a scheduled live music concert was broadcast over the Internet; it was sent over both the Mbone and the emerging World Wide Web. The band was Deth Specula, a group composed of SCO employees. Their first song parodied Grand Funk Railroad&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;re an American Band&quot;. Deth Specula sang &quot;We Are an Internet Band&quot; with lyrics like:

=== &quot;Everest&quot; ===
The next big product release from the company was code-named &quot;Everest&quot;. It resulted from three years of labor at SCO&#x27;s Santa Cruz, Watford, and Toronto development sites, an effort that amounted to $50 million in research and development costs. The general thrust of the work was towards supporting the requirements of business-critical servers. It included adding support for memory-mapped files, the journaling HTFS filesystem with mirroring and striping support, disk compression, RAID levels 0, 1, and 5, POSIX.1b real-time scheduling and semaphores, the Advanced Power Management interface, and SVID 3–level conformance. Everest expanded MP support from 8 to 32 processors. Everest has hardware support for 900 different physical machines, of which 60 were SMP systems, and for some 2,000 peripheral devices.

Another major new feature of Everest is the SCOadmin system administration tool, with both graphical and command-line interfaces, and software upgrades that can be run either locally or remotely. The existence of an administration framework and GUI was considered by &quot;InfoWorld&quot; writer Jason Pontin to be important in competing with the user-friendly qualities of Windows NT.

Everest was released as SCO OpenServer Release 5. The release was celebrated with a corporate event at the Hudson Theatre in New York City on May 9, 1995. The location was chosen in part to give the product an East Coast corporate veneer rather than a West Coast laid-back one. As part of the release publicity, SCO emphasized they had settled on competing in the server market and had halted any attempt to compete with Windows in the desktop client market.

Industry analysts were generally impressed with OpenServer. Testers of beta releases of the product, including Taco Bell which was deploying OpenServer to each of its 4,000 stores, were impressed by its reliability.

Although parts of the Unix kernel were rewritten during the Everest project, it is still fundamentally the nearly ten-year-old System V Release 3.2 kernel and as such has some limitations, such as not being multithreaded. This lack of native threads support would prove a challenge in years to come when certain kinds of modern system software needed to run on the platform. OpenServer 5 was compatible with around 8,000 business applications, and it was partly a desire to maintain compatibility with existing applications that prevented SCO from making more drastic changes to the operating system. Overall on a technical evaluation, &quot;PC Magazine&quot; found OpenServer 5 to be good but not quite as good as Novell&#x27;s UnixWare 2 product. One Unix OEM told &quot;PC Week&quot; that OpenServer 5 was &quot;a good product, but it&#x27;s not a revolutionary product; it&#x27;s an evolutionary product. It doesn&#x27;t quite do the enterprise stuff people are looking for.&quot;

One project which sought to improve OpenServer&#x27;s technology base was code-named &quot;MK2&quot;. Its origins date to 1992 with an agreement between SCO and the French company Chorus Systèmes SA for cooperative work on the Chorus microkernel technology in the context of combining OpenServer with a microkernel for use in real-time processing environments in telecommunications and other areas. The first result of this, a dual-functionality product called Chorus/Fusion for SCO Open Systems Software, was released in 1994. By 1995, SCO had set up a business unit for the MK2 venture and was spending considerable amounts of engineering resources on what was now a reimplementation of OpenServer to run on top of the Chorus microkernel, in what was going to be called the SCO Telecommunications OS Platform. A primary customer for this work was the Private Communications Systems unit within Siemens AG. Later in 1995 the MK2 project had to adjust for SCO&#x27;s acquisition of UnixWare technology from Novell, and the goal became to run merged OpenServer/UnixWare code on top of Chorus. However, by early 1997, relations had broken down between SCO, Chorus, and the customer, and the MK2 project was scrapped without having achieved fruition.

Through several changes of corporate ownership, SCO OpenServer 5 would remain a supported product into the 2020s.

On July 1, 1995, Lars Turndal retired and Alok Mohan became the company&#x27;s CEO. Mohan&#x27;s background was in corporate finance and strategic planning with AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions. The equities market immediately reflected changes in SCO financial statements: When customers spent more time evaluating OpenServer 5 rather than buying it during the first quarter it was available, SCO missed its forecasted earnings and SCO stock lost a quarter of its value.

=== Client Integration Division ===
In February 1993, SCO acquired IXI Limited, a software company in Cambridge, UK, best known for its X.desktop product, which formed the graphical basis of Open Desktop. In December 1994, SCO bought Visionware, of Leeds, UK, developers of XVision. The roles of the two companies were different but complementary, as one former SCO UK employee has succinctly summarised: &quot;IXI specialised in software that ran on Unix and made Unix easier to use. ... Visionware specialised in software that ran on Windows that made Unix easier to use.&quot;

In 1995, SCO combined the two development teams to form the IXI Visionware, Ltd. subsidiary. Later in 1995, the merged business unit was subsumed more fully into its parent and became the Client Integration Division of SCO.

These acquisitions were part of SCO acknowledging that it did not want to compete with Microsoft on the desktop, but rather wanted to put forward a Windows-friendly product strategy. It also fit SCO&#x27;s idea of the client–server model of computing, where SCO would offer connectivity and middleware components to support Windows clients talking to SCO servers.

In May 1997, the Client Integration Division released the Vision97 family of products: XVision Eclipse (a PC X server), VisionFS (an SMB server for UNIX), TermVision (a terminal emulator for Microsoft Windows), SuperVision (centralised management of users from Windows), and SQL-Retriever (ODBC- and JDBC-compliant database connectivity software). The VisionFS product was developed from scratch by the Cambridge development team; the other products were developed by the Leeds development team and were mostly new versions of the existing Visionware products. A later release of the suite is branded as Vision2K.

The Client Integration Division was relatively independent of the rest of SCO, for reasons both technical and organizational. It ported its code to all major Unix platforms, including those of SCO&#x27;s competitors. It operated its own web site for some time. The SCO Unix channel-based sales model did not work well for the Vision products, and the client division had its own sales force. This was illustrated by SCO having two different subsidiaries in Japan: Nihon SCO, which dealt with the operating system products and services, and SCO K.K., a joint venture which handled the Vision product line.

==Later history==
=== The Novell–SCO–HP deal of 1995 ===

Novell&#x27;s 1993 acquisition of Unix System Laboratories had never really worked out, and by late summer 1995 Novell was looking for a way out of the Unix business. On September 20, 1995, Novell announced the sale of that business to SCO, coincident with a licensing arrangement with Hewlett-Packard. As part of the deal, SCO said that it would merge the SVR4.2-based UnixWare with the SVR3.2-based OpenServer, creating a new merged product code-named &quot;Gemini&quot;. Gemini would then be sold through SCO&#x27;s channel and reseller operation. SCO and HP also said that they would co-develop a next-generation, 64-bit version of Unix for use with &quot;Merced&quot;, the code name for HP and Intel&#x27;s upcoming 64-bit architecture. Some 400 Novell software engineers had been working on UnixWare, mostly in an office in Florham Park, New Jersey; almost all of these engineers joined either SCO or HP (about a year later, the SCO part relocated to offices in Murray Hill, New Jersey). The part of the deal between Novell and SCO closed on December 6, 1995.

As Doug Michels later reflected in 2006, SCO seized on the idea of buying the Unix business from Novell for three reasons: &quot;for one, we got all the talent from Bell Labs that had created Unix; two, we got the moral authority around Unix; and three, we got rid of all the crazy historical licensing problems&quot; dating from Unix&#x27;s origins within AT&amp;T. In order to reduce the price to SCO, part of the deal was that SCO agreed to pay a royalty stream back to Novell of UnixWare sales.
By December 1995, there were already some indications that the three-way arrangement was not working out as had been initially advertised. The computer industry was not sure that SCO could handle being the primary Unix shepherd. The HP project, code-named &quot;White Box&quot;, focused on making a hybrid environment out of the SRV4.2-based Gemini and the SVR3.2-based HP-UX, but that effort faced major technical hurdles.

&quot;White Box&quot; became the 3DA effort, the purpose of which was to unify OpenServer, UnixWare, and HP-UX in some way to produce a resulting product would then become the de facto Unix standard for both existing IA-32 systems and the upcoming IA-64. The effort was motivated in part by threat of Windows NT threat taking advantage of splits among Unix providers when 64-bit systems arrived in common use. By August 1996, HP and SCO were delivering application programming interface (API) specifications to various OEMs and ISVs, as well as doing a best-of-breed technology analysis to determine whether Gemini or HP-UX would be the going-forward source base for a given component. Both companies were also doing porting work to Merced using the early-version compilers available.

The effort was still in theory going in early 1997, when HP and SCO were to publish the &quot;Lodi&quot; set of common programming interfaces for a 64-bit Unix incorporating elements of OpenServer, UnixWare, and HP-UX. But little progress had been made on actual implementation, with sources for only a few components having been exchanged by the two companies. The collaboration failed for both business reasons – HP and SCO had differing perceptions of the marketplace – and technical ones – an inability to produce a common binary Unix-for-Intel product that could run existing applications from both companies&#x27; user bases. Primary among the technical obstacles were endianness considerations.

As an &quot;InformationWeek&quot; story later wrote, the three-way deal had been a &quot;complicated plan&quot; that was &quot;confusing from the start&quot;. The terms of the deal between Novell and SCO were uncertain enough that an amendment to the agreement had to be signed in October 1996. (Even that was not clear enough to preclude an extended legal battle between Novell and The SCO Group during SCO-Linux disputes of the 2000s, a battle that The SCO Group eventually lost.)

=== &quot;Gemini&quot; and the UDK ===
Meanwhile, SCO focused on &quot;Gemini&quot;, the task of combining the OpenServer and UnixWare product lines on 32-bit systems. The fundamental idea behind the Gemini was that SCO could merge OpenServer 5 and UnixWare 2 in a way that would satisfy the requirements of both small businesses and large enterprises and thus keep the existing customer base that SCO had with OpenServer while entering the enterprise space with UnixWare.

One consequence of the UnixWare acquisition was that the New Jersey office of Novell had a languages and development tools group with more advanced technology than what SCO Canada had been working with, including a C++ compiler based upon the Edison Design Group front-end, and that made the SCO Canada engineering staff largely redundant once the Novell deal was closed. As a result, the Toronto office was shut down in early 1996.
What the New Jersey group produced was the Universal Development Kit (UDK), which was a key element in the question of how to help OpenServer users to make the move to Gemini.
With the UDK, a single build of a single version of an application&#x27;s source code could produce binaries that would run unaltered on all three of SCO&#x27;s platforms: UnixWare 2, OpenServer 5, and the upcoming Gemini.
 The UDK featured more modern C and C++ compilers and other tools compared to what OpenServer had, and included platform-specific optimizations for things such as C++ exception handling. The hope was that existing OpenServer developers would switch to using the UDK and thereby get an easy path towards migrating to Gemini.

Support for the new Java programming language and related Java technologies was also emphasized as a key part of the UDK and the operating system products themselves. Over the next several years, SCO would add engineering efforts towards making Java an effective vehicle for customers to use on SCO platforms, including a mapping of Java threads onto UnixWare light-weight processes, recognition of Java class files as first-class Unix executables, as well as adapting a just-in-time compiler to the original Sun Java virtual machine. Another announced SCO effort related to Java was PerkUp, an infrastructure built on the Java classloader facility that was billed as an additional service for UnixWare 7 that would reduce the total memory and throughput needs when multiple Java server applications were running on a system (however, PerkUp never emerged as a product, and the patent for it ended up with Apple, Inc. before expiring).

Initially, SCO had made a strong push for Gemini among the SCO user base; the August 1996 instance of the annual SCO Forum conference dedicated an extra two days to a series of &quot;Gemini Fast-Track&quot; sessions. But by a year later, SCO had decided it would not push the migration that quickly, although it still expected that within two or three years all users would migrate. One SCO executive said, &quot;We mustn&#x27;t disenfranchise the OpenServer path ... those guys [SCO resellers] are our lifeblood&quot; and recalled that a few years earlier, SCO resellers had continued to sell Xenix-based systems even after SCO had stopped development work on Xenix.

When released as a product, Gemini was called UnixWare 7; the &quot;7&quot; was picked to reflect the summed merge of OpenServer 5 and UnixWare 2. SCO referred to UnixWare 7 as being based on an SVR5 kernel, indicating a significant jump over the existing SVR4.2, although the SVR5 designation was not picked up by the Unix world at large. UnixWare 7 was announced in March 1998 at an event in New York.

SCO committed itself to still maintaining and improving the OpenServer product for a couple of years, but made clear that it would never be expanded to 64-bit architectures. Thus at that point, OpenServer users would have to migrate.

=== &quot;Big E&quot; and DCAP ===

SCO management was intent on selling UnixWare through OEM deals with hardware manufacturers aiming at the enterprise market, and towards this end in 1996 they announced the &quot;Big E&quot; initiative that would standardize UnixWare as the operating system on these systems and that would attract independent software vendors to make their products available on such systems. Hardware vendors already supporting UnixWare 7 included IBM, HP, Compaq, and Tandem, despite some of them offering their own Unix flavors on their high-end RISC systems. In particular, SCO had deals with IBM to sell UnixWare on the IBM Netfinity system.

In February 1998, SCO announced the creation of the Data Center Acceleration Program (DCAP), which sought to add features related to reliability, availability, and scalability to UnixWare 7 in order to make it fully suitable for high-end, Intel-based systems deployed in data centers. The funding for DCAP came from Intel and from four hardware OEM providers of Intel-based servers: Compaq, Data General, ICL, and Unisys. The features to be added to UnixWare 7 included six-way clustering and support for 16-way ccNUMA servers. As one analyst for International Data Group said, &quot;UnixWare is moving upmarket.&quot; The program was also intended to help SCO fund development of UnixWare for the Merced architecture and give the four hardware vendors access to the resulting 64-bit OEM UnixWare without requiring further porting to each vendor&#x27;s specific hardware.

A year later, at the CeBIT show in March 1999, SCO announced the release of UnixWare 7, Data Center Edition, as the product of the DCAP effort. In addition to the sponsoring companies, IBM and Sequent both said they would offer the data center edition on their servers. In terms of high availability figures, the data center edition promised 99.99% availability (&quot;four nines&quot;) at the time of release, with 99.995% (&quot;four and a half nines&quot;) to arrive by 2000. Another avenue towards capturing space in the enterprise was work that SCO did in conjunction with Compaq and Tandem towards the 1998 release of UnixWare NonStop Clusters.

The data center release came out at the same time as UnixWare 7.1 release, which offers six different edition bundles in all. A review in &quot;InfoWorld&quot; said that &quot;UnixWare 7 is the sturdiest and most feature-rich Unix ever ported to Intel processors&quot; and added that, especially with the addition of the webtop interface, the 7.1 release was equal in polish to Windows NT. UnixWare 7.1 started seeing some strong sales.

Through several changes of corporate ownership, UnixWare 7 would remain a supported product into the 2020s.

Another multi-company initiative that SCO led was the Uniform Driver Interface project (UDI), which sought to establish an OS-neutral and platform-neutral portable interface for writing device drivers. The UDI project had the backing of Intel, HP, IBM, Compaq, Sun, and others, as well as the involvement of independent hardware vendors such as Adaptec. UDI details were heavily discussed at the 1999 edition of SCO Forum; and UDI materialized in SCO operating systems with later UnixWare 7 and OpenServer 5 releases.

===Tarantella product===

October 1997 saw the first release of a new product from the Client Integration Division. Tarantella is an application brokering platform that sits between back-end applications running on various platforms and Java-enabled web browser clients. An initial limitation was that it supported applications running on Unix but needed third-party software in order to handle mainframe or Windows applications. One selling point of Tarantella is that users could begin working on an application on one client, have to stop working for whatever reason, and then resume working from that point on from another client. A review in &quot;InfoWorld&quot; viewed Tarantella was promising but needing more work.

Later version 1.x releases support more application types, such as AS/400 and IBM mainframe applications. More client types were added as well, including native clients to remove the dependency on Java support. The product also added scalability and security features to better support larger enterprises and secure application access over the Internet.

A rebranding to Tarantella Enterprise II took place in late 1999. This release added support for Windows applications via native support for Microsoft&#x27;s Remote Desktop Protocol. At that point, the primary competitor to Tarantella became the MetaFrame product from Citrix Systems. While Citrix was the dominant player in this space, it did not yet support Unix applications, whereas Tarantella does.

Significant revenue from Tarantella did not happen during the 1990s, as it had a long sales cycle due to lengthy customer evaluations. SCO then sought to market Tarantella as a platform for application service providers to use and as a way that companies could host and outsource applications. As part of this, SCO sought to use Tarantella as a way of promoting itself as a new dot com company as opposed to its twenty-year history as an operating system provider.

SCO were pioneers in the notion of a web desktop, or webtop. This was also central to the idea of how Tarantella presents applications to a user. This was integrated with Tarantella to provide a UnixWare 7 webtop in 1999 which organizes access to UnixWare and its applications via any Java-enabled web browser. To some industry reviewers, the OS webtop was a compelling feature.

=== Customers and financial state ===
Between 1996 and 1997, SCO&#x27;s share of the Unix systems sold rose from 36 percent to 40 percent. By 1998, the figure was over 40 percent. And in 1998, shipments of SCO Unix systems grew by 58 percent over 1997, a greater increase than for any other server-oriented flavor of Unix. The Unix market as a whole was considered strong, despite fears of the increasing power of Windows NT. And by 1998, SCO had 85 percent of the Unix-on-Intel market. At the end of the 1990s, SCO Unix systems had around 15,000 value-added resellers (VARs) and an infrastructure presence of some kind in 80 countries around the world. SCO also had a strong business in replicated sites, meaning retail companies where there was a SCO system in each store of a chain; such customers included fast food outlets such as McDonald&#x27;s, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell; pharmacy chains such as CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens; and other chains such as Kmart and Radio Shack. Other well-known companies who were SCO customers included Northwest Airlines, as well as Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber, Nasdaq, Inc., and Lucent Technologies. SCO was named to &quot;PC Magazine&quot;″s &quot;100 Most Influential Companies&quot; list in both 1997 and 1998.
The company did not have good financial results during this time. By 1997, there were few independent operating system vendors left in the industry other than SCO. Being a software-only company whose revenue was only around the $200 million mark left SCO with marginal resources to compete with Unixes from the big RISC vendors like Digital, HP, and Sun.
Engineering costs were high, as UnixWare 7 and Tarantella each resulted from two years of research and development activity.
During 1997 there were some reductions in staff and closing of regional offices.

In April 1998, Doug Michels was named as president and CEO of the company, with Alok Mohan becoming chairman of the board. Michels said that he never aimed to become CEO, preferring to remain more technology-focused, but that he had always had a lot of visibility into the CEO role and was &quot;obviously very emotionally and intellectually attached to the company&quot; and its stakeholders.

One of Michels&#x27; first actions was to oversee a switch to electronic software licensing for SCO&#x27;s products. The third quarter of fiscal 1997 had included a $23 million charge for reduction in channel inventory, and Michels said he was determined to eliminate issues related to the size of physical inventory. He stated that, &quot;SCO believes electronic licensing and distribution of products will be a standard for the industry.&quot; The channel inventory was emptied by July 1998 and the new electronic licensing was in effect the following month for a new point release of OpenServer 5, the product that was still accounting for some 80 percent of SCO&#x27;s Unix revenues.

=== &quot;Monterey&quot; ===

During the mid- to late 1990s, many in the computer industry believed that Intel&#x27;s under-development 64-bit architecture, known as IA-64 and code-named &quot;Merced&quot;, would dominate the marketplace once released. But the architecture was very different from IA-32 and migrating operating systems and tools to it was very expensive. SCO needed a well-funded hardware company to ally with; the earlier 3DA initiative with HP had failed, and discussions about SCO being compatible with the &quot;Bravo Unix&quot; from Compaq and its Digital Unix had not gotten far. When IBM proposed an alliance, SCO jumped at the chance to further bolster its entry into the enterprise space.

The core idea of Project Monterey was to take elements from IBM&#x27;s AIX, Sequent&#x27;s DYNIX/ptx, and SCO&#x27;s UnixWare, to form a merged 64-bit Unix for Intel&#x27;s Merced architecture. This merged OS was supposed to become available at the same time as Merced, in mid-2000.

Along the way, there would be stages of earlier deliverables. IBM pledged as part of the deal to make UnixWare 7 its Unix of choice for high volume IA-32 systems and to devote considerable efforts towards selling UnixWare 7 through its sales and marketing mechanisms. This would be aided by IBM including its middleware and some AIX technology into 32-bit UnixWare, and conversely some UnixWare technology would be incorporated into future versions of AIX. IBM would gain access to SCO&#x27;s experience with Unix on Intel as well as access to SCO&#x27;s reseller channel.

Part of the motivation for Monterey was another attempt by Unix vendors to show a clear advantage for Unix in the high-end enterprise space against Microsoft&#x27;s latest NT offering, now being branded as Windows 2000 and scheduled to be available for Merced as well. Towards that end, Intel said they would create a multi-million dollar fund for ISVs to develop for the 64-bit Monterey. &quot;InfoWorld&quot; stated that IBM had &quot;stunned the industry&quot; with the move, in part because IBM was playing catch-up in the Merced space.

The project was announced by the involved companies on October 26, 1998, in New York. An IBM executive said, &quot;IBM is totally committed to making this effort a success.&quot; One SCO executive said that Monterey was &quot;probably the biggest deal SCO has done.&quot;

But not every industry observer was enthusiastic; the story about the deal in &quot;Computer Reseller News &quot; began, &quot;Just what the world needs: another Unix.&quot; In any case, the project proceeded, with AIX becoming the dominant technology within it rather than UnixWare. By October 1999, a year after the announcement, the work-in-progress Monterey was said to be up and operational on early silicon versions of Itanium, as Merced was by then officially called, and able to run both 32-bit UnixWare binaries and 64-bit natively built binaries on it.

However, as 2000 began, things were changing at IBM, as there was a corporate-wide strategic initiative to get behind the open-source Linux operating system. A few months later IBM released a major upgrade to AIX, but instead of it being associated with Monterey, it was called AIX 5L with the &#x27;L&#x27; indicating an affinity for Linux. It was clear to industry observers that IBM considered Monterey to be over with. IBM&#x27;s decision to shelve Monterey left the SCO product line without a 64-bit Unix solution. Itanium was further delayed, and when it did come out, it failed to succeed in the marketplace; so Project Monterey was a failure from multiple perspectives.

=== Y2K surge and recede ===
The open-source-software movement was something that SCO had to be cognizant of, and for a number of years SCO Skunkware, a frequently updated collection of open source packages built for SCO platforms, had helped bridge the gap between the traditional and open source development worlds. Then in an attempt to deal with the growing popularity of Linux as a low-cost operating system, during 1999 SCO began offering consulting services for Linux. SCO also engaged in partnerships with, and investments into, various Linux companies. This included agreements to sell Linux distributions from Caldera Systems, SuSE, and TurboLinux, as well as a partnership to provide professional services to customers of TurboLinux server farms and an investment in the LinuxMall portal site. One motivation for some of these initiatives was an effort by SCO to enlarge its professional services operation, as by 1999 such activity only comprised about 5 percent of SCO&#x27;s total revenues. Finally, a vice president for marketing was hired who had a Linux background.

During 1998 and 1999, much of the computer industry, including SCO, was focused on dealing with the Y2K problem. SCO saw a surge in sales as customers bought new, Y2K-compliant products and upgrades to replace the vulnerable software they were running. As a consequence, the company began reporting better financial results during 1999 and its stock began a slow upward climb, starting from a prior low point of 2. To meet the demand, SCO added more staff.

In October 1999, the company announced record earnings for a quarter and a year and its highest yearly revenue mark at $224 million. The results broke a four-year streak of SCO losing money. The company also had the best cash position in its history, with some $62 million in that form or in short-term investments. As a result, its stock price rose to a new high of 14. Michels expressed optimism, saying the year was &quot;a turning point&quot; and &quot;the beginning of very strong ongoing business.&quot;

The stock&#x27;s biggest surge happened in mid-December 1999, when Steve Harmon, an influential analyst covering technology companies, went on CNBC and included SCO on his list of ten stock picks for 2000. The stock promptly jumped by 7 points, and in late December 1999 the stock reached an all-time high of 35.
SCO&#x27;s value was seen in having a solid core business with earnings and revenue; in having some kind of Linux play; and in having a new-technology, Internet-capitalizing product in Tarantella. An analyst for the GiGa Information Group agreed that SCO was a company to watch in 2000.

But the Y2K-based splurge would not last. In March and July 2000, SCO announced earnings shortfalls, with SCO&#x27;s Unix products selling slowly once Y2K anxiety was past. The increasing popularity of Linux solutions had resumed taking its toll as well. By July, only seven months after its peak at over 35, the stock price had crashed to below 5. The company announced it was cutting costs as a result and that it had hired investment bankers Chase H&amp;Q to explore &quot;strategic combinations&quot; with other companies.

Fundamentally, SCO was doing battle on one hand in a commercial software world increasingly dominated by Microsoft and on the other hand in a world where open source Linux was undermining commercial software itself. These two factors made constantly pleasing Wall Street investors with double-digit growth figures an imposing task. In particular, Linux posed an existential threat to SCO OpenServer&#x27;s low-end marketshare; as one analyst said, &quot;Linux can give you the same value proposition [as SCO] – a Unix on cheap hardware – for less money.&quot; And despite all the efforts, UnixWare had not been fully successful in competing in the high-end market, and now Linux was threatening UnixWare&#x27;s share of that as well. As a result, by mid-2000, SCO&#x27;s market position, and the company itself, was rapidly collapsing.

==Final history==
=== Asset sale and change of name ===

In March 2000, at the time of the first announced earnings shortfall, SCO had reorganized into three divisions: Server Software, Professional Services, and Tarantella. The split was intended to highlight Tarantella as a product independent of SCO Unix, and was seen by industry analysts as a prelude to some or all of the divisions being sold. As one International Data Corporation analyst said, &quot;SCO has to do something with their business model because their business is eroding.&quot;
On August 2, 2000, following several months of negotiations, SCO announced that it would sell its Server Software and Services Divisions, including UnixWare, to the Linux company Caldera Systems. The deal was complex, involving cash, stock, and loans, and difficult to evaluate monetarily, but based on the price of Caldera Systems stock at the time it was worth around $110–114 million.

The idea of the purchase from Caldera Systems&#x27; perspective is that it would gain access to SCO&#x27;s large VAR channel; the value of such channels was well known to former Novell chief Ray Noorda, whose Canopy Group was funding Caldera Systems. The announcement that SCO was selling its Unix assets to a Linux distribution company represented, in the view of Eric Raymond, the completion of the move from the commercial Unix industry to the open-source movement. From Doug Michels&#x27; later perspective, the problem with Linux was not that it was open source and free itself, but rather that in August 1999, during the dot-com boom, the Linux company Red Hat had been able to get $400 million during their IPO and was not expected to make a profit anytime soon, while SCO was an established public company closely watched by the stock market that was expected to make a profit and had only around $50 million in cash. By this time, the SCO stock price was down around 2. Thus when the chance came to merge with Caldera Systems, which was in a generally similar position as Red Hat although with less cash, SCO took it.

SCO was much the bigger company, with 900 employees at that point to Caldera Systems&#x27; 120. Throughout the year there had been layoffs from SCO, including the shutting down of the Watford development office. In addition a number of longtime SCO employees chose to leave the company. An especially large layoff took place in September 2000, soon after the Caldera Systems announcement, when 190 employees were let go, comprising 19 percent of the company&#x27;s workforce. This layoff included 40 employees in Santa Cruz itself.

The SCO acquisition was originally scheduled to close in October 2000, but got delayed due to concerns from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the details of the merger. However, the two companies&#x27; support organizations did get combined during this time. In addition, there was confusion among the SCO customer base about the fate of OpenServer. So in February 2001, the deal was renegotiated to include OpenServer in what was sold to Caldera Systems, although a percentage of OpenServer revenue would still go back to SCO. The monetary terms of the deal were adjusted as well, with Caldera Systems paying SCO more cash than in the original agreement.

Finally on May 7, 2001, SCO completed the sale of its Server Software and Services Divisions, as well as UnixWare and OpenServer technologies, to Caldera Systems. At that time Caldera Systems changed its name to Caldera International, and the remaining part of SCO, the Tarantella Division, changed its name to Tarantella, Inc.

=== Aftermath ===
The sale of the company&#x27;s Unix assets and renaming of what was left marked the end of an era for not just SCO but the town of Santa Cruz as well. The staff going to Caldera moved into the 400 Encinal building while the newly named Tarantella occupied the 425 Encinal structure.

There were ironies in SCO&#x27;s demise being largely from the effects of Linux, since SCO had been a pioneer of the open systems movement. As one writer stated, &quot;In some ways, SCO was Linux before Linux, popularizing Unix on low-cost Intel machines.&quot;

In August 2002, Caldera International renamed itself The SCO Group since the SCO Unix products were still their greatest source of revenue due to the large installed base they had. That entity soon started the SCO-Linux controversies.

Those familiar with the Santa Cruz Operation, including those who worked there and those who wrote about it, became protective of that company&#x27;s reputation, especially given the possible name confusion regarding the role The SCO Group played in the attacks on Linux. As former Santa Cruz Operation employee wrote later about The SCO Group, &quot;I&#x27;ll spare you the sordid legal details, but by then, it was no longer our SCO.&quot;

== Company culture ==
=== Santa Cruz atmosphere ===
From its inception and co-founding by UC Santa Cruz graduate Doug Michels, the company drew upon the readily available technical talent who chose to remain in the central California coastal town of Santa Cruz after graduating. But the town and university affected the company as well. SCO was at the center of the Santa Cruz tech scene, with many employees moving from it to other tech companies or vice versa. Some of the feel of the SCO offices was carried forward in coworking facilities later set up in Santa Cruz by two former SCO employees.

New products were promoted with mock film posters. The Vice President of Marketing and Communications was, through much of the 1980s and early 1990s, Bruce Steinberg, who was an artist and musician in the San Francisco area music scene, whose credits included having designed the &quot;flying toasters&quot; cover of the Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s 1973 live album &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Winterland&quot;.

The Santa Cruz Operation name itself brought comments; one Canadian industry writer called it &quot;One of the coolest company names I ever came across since entering this business&quot;.

From its earliest days through to its last ones, The Santa Cruz Operation was known for reflecting the casual ambience of its namesake town. Dress was casual to the point where some staffers went barefoot. There was beer in the office, end-of-day meetings held on Encinal Street roofs, and an outdoor hot tub at the Mission Street office (dating from the facility&#x27;s previous existence as a holistic health clinic) that was used during the day or for late-night, after-work parties. One former employee said years later of her experience there, &quot;It was a family. We played hard, but we also worked hard. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve worked anywhere since that&#x27;s had that kind of feel.&quot; The SCO reputation was exemplified by an oft-related story of a time where the company had to put out a rule that &quot;clothing must be worn during office hours,&quot; caused by an instance where someone walking in from the hot tub had not done so and a potential corporate partner had been paying a visit.

Over 500 former Santa Cruz Operation employees held a reunion at the Cocoanut Grove venue in Santa Cruz in 2012.

=== SCO Forum ===

Beginning in 1987, SCO hosted an annual Summer conference for the international Unix community. Called SCO Forum, it was held on the University of California, Santa Cruz&#x27;s scenic redwood-forested campus overlooking Monterey Bay, drew some 2000–3000 attendees, and lasted for much of a week.

Featured speakers over the years included Douglas Adams, Scott Adams, Dave Barry, Clifford Stoll, John Perry Barlow, Linus Torvalds, Andy Grove (Intel), Michael Swavely (Compaq), Steve Ballmer (Microsoft), and Scott McNealy (Sun Microsystems). Musical entertainment included concerts by Jefferson Starship, Tower of Power, Roger McGuinn, Jan &amp; Dean, The Kingsmen, The Surfaris, and Deth Specula.

Due to its useful content and its relaxed, fun atmosphere, SCO Forum became known as one of the best such conferences to go to in the industry and was viewed fondly by those who attended. It was the largest tech event in the Santa Cruz area and made a multi-million dollar impact on the local economy.

=== Palookaville webcasts ===
Following the first live Internet concert in 1994, SCO continued in that tradition by sponsoring and producing a series of live Internet webcasts from the popular Santa Cruz night club Palookaville. These webcasts demonstrated the use of UnixWare 7 as a real-time audio and video webcasting server utilizing RealAudio and RealVideo technologies from RealNetworks.

=== Trapping a hacker ===
SCO was a target of one of the most publicized security hackers of the 1980s and 1990s, Kevin Mitnick, who broke into the company&#x27;s systems in 1987. SCO&#x27;s staff detected his intrusions and engaged in exchanges with him that allowed them to track his activities. After about a week of this, it appeared that the intruder was trying to modify or copy Xenix code. Authorities having been notified, the phone line Mitnick was using for the intrusions was discovered and he was arrested. He reached a deal to plead to a misdemeanor for which he did no jail time, but it was his first conviction as an adult. SCO officials agreed not to sue him if he would explain his hacking techniques to them. But when a SCO staffer traveled to meet him, he was uncommunicative. In any case, Mitnick soon continued his intruder activities against other companies&#x27; systems.

=== SCO Follies ===
From 1985 to 2001, the company hosted a Winter Solstice party at the Cocoanut Grove in Santa Cruz featuring a live musical show known as &quot;The SCO Follies&quot;. This was a fully scripted and produced satire skewering SCO management and the high-tech industry. It featured live action, musical numbers, and videos. On September 22, 2012, the SCO Alumni Association hosted the SCOGala Reunion party at the Cocoanut Grove, which included the first SCO Follies since 2001. Some 500 former employees, friends, and family attended the event.

== Alliances ==
SCO was a primary partner in several industry alliances, intended to promote SCO operating system technology as a de facto standard for emerging hardware platforms. The most notable of these were:

* The ACE Consortium: Founded by Compaq, Microsoft, MIPS Computer Systems, Silicon Graphics, Digital Equipment Corporation, and SCO in 1991, to drive the next generation of PCs powered by the Advanced RISC Computing Specification (ARC)
* 3DA: Formed by SCO and Hewlett-Packard in 1995, to define the standard Unix for IA-32 and later IA-64 systems
* Uniform Driver Interface: Led by SCO and with work starting in 1997, the UDI project sought to establish an OS-neutral and platform-neutral portable interface for writing device drivers. The UDI project had the backing of Intel, HP, IBM, Compaq, Sun, and others. 
* Project Monterey: Formed by SCO, IBM, Sequent and Intel in 1998, to define the standard UNIX for IA-64 systems. Also intended to merge some of the proprietary Unix products afloat at the time.

None of these alliances were ultimately successful.

SCO was also part of 1993&#x27;s COSE initiative, a more successful and broadly supported initiative to create an open and unified UNIX standard.

SCO was a founding member of 86open (1997–1999), hosting the first meeting of the Unix on Intel standards effort.

<doc id="484731" wikidata="Q939645" url="?curid=484731" title="Seed money">
<text>Seed money, also known as seed fundingorseed capital, is a form of securities offering in which an investor puts capital in a startup company in exchange for an equity stake or convertible note stake in the company. The term &quot;seed&quot; suggests that this is a very early investment, meant to support the business until it can generate cash of its own (see cash flow), or until it is ready for further investments. Seed money options include friends and family funding, seed venture capital funds, angel funding, and crowdfunding.

==Usage==

Traditionally, companies that have yet to meet listing requirements or qualify for bank loans, recognize VC as providers of financial support and value added services. Seed money can be used to pay for preliminary operations such as market research and product development. Investors can be the founders themselves, using savings and loans. They can be family members and friends of the founders. Investors can also be outside angel investors, venture capitalists, accredited investors, equity crowdfunding investors, revenue-based financing lenders, or government programs.

==Early-stage funding==
Seed capital can be distinguished from venture capital in that venture capital investments tend to come from institutional investors, involve significantly more money, are arm&#x27;s length transactions, and involve much greater complexity in the contracts and corporate structure accompanying the investment. Seed funding is generally one of the first steps investors offer to get startups on their feet before they become fully operational. Seed funding involves a higher risk than normal venture capital funding since the investor does not see any existing projects to evaluate for funding. Hence, the investments made are usually lower (in the tens of thousands to the hundreds of thousands of dollars range) as against normal venture capital investment (in the hundreds of thousands to the millions of dollars range), for similar levels of stake in the company. Seed funding can be raised online using equity crowdfunding platforms such as SeedInvest, Seedrs and Angels Den. Investors make their decision whether to fund a project based on the perceived strength of the idea and the capabilities, skills and history of the founders.

==Government funding==
This is the most selective type of funding. Government funds may be targeted toward youth, with the age of the founder a determinant. Often, these programmes can be targeted towards adolescent self-employment during the summer vacation. Depending on the political system, municipal government may be in charge of small disbursements. The European Commission runs microfinance programmes (loans under €25 000) for self-employed people and businesses with fewer than 10 employees. European seed capital is available, but typically is limited to a 50% share. European SMEs can often benefit from the Eureka programme, which federates SMEs and research organisations, such as universities. Government programmes are often tied to political initiatives.

==Other sources==
Seed money may also come from product crowdfunding or from financial bootstrapping, rather than an equity offering. Bootstrapping in this context means making use of the cash flow of an existing enterprise, such as in the case of Chitika and Cidewalk.

=== Types of Seed funding ===

* Friends and family funding: This type of seed funding involves raising money from friends and family members.
* Angel investing: As mentioned above, angel investors are wealthy individuals who provide seed funding in exchange for equity ownership.
* Seed accelerators: These are programs that provide startups with seed funding, mentorship, and resources to help them grow their businesses.
* Crowdfunding: This type of funding allows startups to raise money from a large number of people, typically through an online platform.
* Incubators: These are organizations that provide startups with seed funding, office space, and resources to help them grow their businesses.
* Government grants: Some government agencies provide seed funding for startups working on specific projects or in specific industries.
* Corporate ventures: Some big companies set up venture arms to provide seed funding to startups in their industry or complementary field.
* Micro-Venture Capital: A type of venture capital that provides seed funding to new startups and early-stage companies with a small amount of money.

<doc id="484740" wikidata="Q7760088" url="?curid=484740" title="The Reindeer Section">
<text>The Reindeer Section are a Scottish indie rock supergroup formed in 2001 by Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol, which released albums and gigged in 2001 and 2002.

Lightbody describes the band&#x27;s sound as &quot;pretty much all very slow, quiet, folky-type stuff. Stuff that I really love listening to, like Low, for example, and Neil Young and Joni Mitchell and all that end of things. It&#x27;s sort of inspired by those records rather than by the American rock music that inspired me to start a band in the first place.&quot;

The songs &quot;You Are My Joy&quot; and &quot;Cartwheels&quot; were featured on the 2009 Snow Patrol best-of album, &quot;Up to Now&quot;.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;Y&#x27;All Get Scared Now, Ya Hear!&quot;: 2001===
The Reindeer Section arose – according to Lightbody – out of a chance get-together of musicians at a Lou Barlow gig in Glasgow in 2001, at which Lightbody drunkenly laid down the challenge to others to &quot;make an album together&quot;, to which everyone said &quot;yeah yeah&quot;. Lightbody &quot;went home and next day wrote the album&quot; and later convinced Johnny Davis of Bright Star to fund a recording session and release the proposed album. The group met over three days of rehearsal and ten days of recording to produce the first album. &quot;Y&#x27;All Get Scared Now, Ya Hear!&quot; was released on 20 October 2001 with a mini tour, the first venue of which was Belfast&#x27;s The Limelight. In television, the track &quot;Will You Please Be There For Me&quot; was used in the closing of episode 39 of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Ed&quot;.

===&quot;Son of Evil Reindeer&quot; and hiatus: 2002===
&quot;Son of Evil Reindeer&quot; was released ten months after the first, with a slightly different line-up. The single, &quot;You Are My Joy&quot; appeared on US show, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, and on the fourth series of US TV series &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;. The song &quot;Cartwheels&quot; appeared on &quot;The Second Chance&quot;, an episode of &quot;The O.C.&quot;. The band&#x27;s most recent gig was on 14 December 2002 at the Queen Margaret Union in Glasgow.

<doc id="484741" wikidata="Q584681" url="?curid=484741" title="South Ronaldsay">
<text>South Ronaldsay (, also , ) is one of the Orkney Islands off the north coast of Scotland. It is linked to the Orkney Mainland by the Churchill Barriers, running via Burray, Glimps Holm and Lamb Holm.

==Name==
Along with North Ronaldsay, the island is named after St Ronald. The original name from which the English name derives, &quot;Rǫgnvaldsey&quot;, comes from Old Norse; &quot;Rǫgnvalds&quot; (&quot;Ronald&#x27;s&quot;) + &quot;ey&quot; (&quot;island&quot;).

==Geography and geology==
With an area of , it is the fourth largest of the Orkney islands after The Mainland, Hoy and Sanday. Ferries sail from Burwick on the island to John o&#x27; Groats on the Scottish mainland and from St Margaret&#x27;s Hope to Gills Bay.

South Ronaldsay&#x27;s main village is St Margaret&#x27;s Hope, Orkney&#x27;s third largest settlement. It is named either after Margaret, Maid of Norway, the heir to the Scottish throne who died in Orkney age seven or possibly Saint Margaret of Scotland. The village has a small blacksmith&#x27;s museum and is known for its annual Boys&#x27; Ploughing Match. During this event young girls and boys dressed in dark jackets play the part of the horses and young boys using miniature ploughs compete with one another at ploughing a 4-foot square rig in the nearby sands.

The cardinal points of the island are Ayre of Cara, by Churchill Barrier no. 4 (north), Grimness (east), Brough Ness, (south) and Hoxa Head, (west). The highest elevation is Ward Hill, which reaches . This name is common one in Orkney for the highest point on an island and comes from the historic use of these places used for the lighting of warning beacons.

==Prehistory==

The island is known for the Neolithic Isbister Chambered Cairn, popularly known as the &quot;Tomb of the Eagles&quot;. Discovered by Ronald Simison in 1958 in the south east of the island, 16,000 human bones and 725 bird bones were found at the site, the latter predominantly belonging to the White-tailed Sea Eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus albicilla&quot;). The evidence suggests that the human bodies had been exposed to the elements to remove the flesh before burial. The tomb was in continuous use for a millennium or more.

The burnt mound at nearby Liddle, discovered by Simison in 1972, is the best example of a Bronze Age cooking place in Orkney. Made of flat slabs originally sealed with clay, the central stone trough would have been filled with water heated by stones using peat as a fuel. The building was probably roofless.

There is a broch site at Howe of Hoxa in the north west that may have been the burial place of Thorfinn &quot;Skullsplitter&quot;.

==History==
In 1627 nine chapels were recorded on the island with some of the names hinting at the existence of Christian worship prior to the Norse conquest of Orkney. They were: Sant Androis at Woundwick, Our Ladie at Halcro, Sant Colmis at Loch of Burwick, Ruid chappell in Sandwick, Sant Tola [Olaf] in Wydwall, Sant Colme in Hoxay, Sant Margrat in the Howp, Sant Colmeis in Grymnes and Sant Ninian in Stow. The locations are all known although little physical evidence remains in several cases.

In the late 17th century South Ronaldsay was described as &quot;fertile in Corns and abounding with People&quot;. Murdoch MacKenzie&#x27;s 1750 map of the island indicates the site of lead workings near Grimness and a visitor in 1774 &quot;saw several deep holes which I was informed were sunk in search of Lead ore&quot; although only small quantities were mined.

By the late 18th century South Ronaldsay was divided into two unequally sized parishes, St Peter&#x27;s covered the northern two thirds of the island while St Mary&#x27;s formed the southern third. St Peter&#x27;s Church has a date stone of 1642 and appears on Blaeu&#x27;s 1654 map. By 1793 the building had no roof and was &quot;exposed to all the winds of heaven&quot; but as probably repaired by 1801. A Pictish symbol stone was discovered in a window in the church. On one face of the slab is a mirror-case underlying part of an undecorated crescent and V-rod and on the other a crescent and V-rod, ornamented with scrollwork, below a decorated panel.

During the 19th century the island&#x27;s economy benefited from the herring fishing industry and St Margaret&#x27;s Hope became the main trading centre for the South Isles. In 1890 there were 20 shops and 18 tradesmen located there.

Tomison&#x27;s Academy was founded by William Tomison, a native of the island who became Governor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. When it opened it had 170 pupils but the school closed in the 1960s. Tomison is buried nearby in the grounds of his former home, Dundas House.
In 1991, the island was rocked by false allegations of widespread child abuse, as part of the worldwide Satanic panic, that saw nine children being removed from their families by police and social workers. The case was thrown out of court when it was found the social workers were using unorthodox interrogation techniques to force confessions from the children, who all denied the abuse.

There are many well-preserved houses and other structures in the local vernacular style.

==Local politics==
The island is part of the &quot;East Mainland, South Ronaldsay and Burray&quot; ward, represented on the Orkney Islands Council by three independent councillors. The local community council covers both South Ronaldsay and Burray.

==Natural history==
&quot;Microtus arvalis ronaldshaiensis&quot; is one of five varieties of the Orkney vole, a sub-species of the common vole found only in the Orkney islands. Larger than the common vole, it resembles the field vole but has shorter, paler fur.

The Orkney voles were introduced to the archipelago in Neolithic times. The oldest known radiocarbon-dated fossil of the Orkney vole is 4600 years BP, which marks the latest possible date of introduction.

<doc id="484742" wikidata="Q16849" url="?curid=484742" title="Matti Nykänen">
<text>Matti Ensio Nykänen (; 17 July 1963 – 4 February 2019) was a Finnish ski jumper who competed from 1981 to 1991. He is one of the most successful ski jumpers of all time, having won five Winter Olympic medals (four gold), nine World Championship medals (five gold), and 22 Finnish Championship medals (14 gold). Most notably, he won three gold medals at the 1988 Winter Olympics, becoming, along with Yvonne van Gennip of the Netherlands, the most medaled athlete that winter.

Nykänen is the only ski jumper in history to have won all five of the sport&#x27;s major individual titles: a gold medal at the Winter Olympics (three times), the Ski Jumping World Championships (once), the Ski Flying World Championships (once), four World Cup overall titles, and the Four Hills Tournament (twice). His four World Cup titles is an all-time male record shared with Adam Małysz. Nykänen remains the only male five-time ski flying world record holder in history.

From the 1990s onwards, Nykänen&#x27;s status as a celebrity was mainly fueled by his personal relationships, his career as a pop singer, and various incidents often related to heavy use of alcohol and violent behaviour. He was sentenced to 26 months in prison following a stabbing incident in 2004, and again for 16 months following an aggravated assault on his wife in 2009.

==Ski jumping career==

For most of the 1980s, Nykänen and Jens Weißflog of East Germany dominated the sport. Nykänen won gold and silver at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. His 17.5-point gold medal victory was the largest margin of victory in Olympic ski jumping history at the time. He was also the first ever to win gold medals on both hills at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. 

In 1985 he flew 191 metres in Planica, a world record that stood briefly until Piotr Fijas (Poland) flew 194 metres, again in Planica, in 1987. His other achievements include a total of nine medals (five golds) at the World Championship level. He also won a total of 46 World Cup competitions (only now topped by the current record-holder Gregor Schlierenzauer, Austria) and won the overall title four times (also a record, currently shared with Adam Małysz Poland). 

He won the prestigious Four Hills Tournament twice. He competed in the FIS Ski Flying World Championships five times and placed in the medals every time. Nykänen also won the ski jumping competition at the Holmenkollen ski festival twice (1982, 1985). In 1987, Nykänen was awarded the Holmenkollen Medal (shared with Hermann Weinbuch).

On 28 February 2008, he won the International Masters Championship for veteran ski jumpers.

===The only one with five world records===

On 16 March 1984, he set ski jumping world distance record on official training two times at 182 metres (597 ft). And on the next day at 185 metres (607 ft), all three in Oberstdorf, West Germany.

On 15 March 1985, he set two ski jumping world distance records on official training at 187 metres (614 ft) and at 191 metres (627 ft), both of them on Velikanka bratov Gorišek in Planica, Yugoslavia.

==Personal life==

Nykänen was married six times:
* Tiina Hassinen (1986–1988), one son
* Pia Hynninen (1989–1991), one daughter
* Sari Paanala (1996–1998) (Nykänen changed his surname to Paanala during this marriage)
* Mervi Tapola (2001–2003, remarried 2004–2010)
* Pia Talonpoika (2014– his death)

===Relationship with Mervi Tapola===

Nykänen met millionaire “sausage heiress” Mervi Tapola (1954–2019) in 1999, and they were married from 2001 to 2003.
They got divorced in 2003, and remarried again in 2004. The marriage was tempestuous and gave rise to many well-publicised incidents: The first reported assault against Tapola occurred in June 2000, following a restraining order that was imposed upon Nykänen. In 2004, Nykänen was handed a suspended sentence for assaulting Tapola again. Nykänen had already been accused of assaulting Tapola in 2001, but the charges were withdrawn because Tapola exercised her right to remain silent.

In September 2005, while on probation for another assault, Nykänen was re-arrested four days after his release for abusing his partner again. Nykänen was convicted and imprisoned for four months on 16 March 2006. Soon after his release, he stabbed a man in a pizza restaurant in Korpilahti. In the summer of 2009, Tapola (then Tapola-Nykänen) petitioned for divorce a 14th time, but cancelled it.

On Christmas Day 2009, Nykänen allegedly injured his wife with a knife and tried to throttle her with a bathrobe belt. He was charged for attempted manslaughter and held in custody by Tampere police, but was released on 28 December after charges were dropped for insufficient evidence. On 24 August 2010, Nykänen was convicted of grievous bodily harm and sentenced to 16 months in prison and ordered to pay €5,000 in compensation to his wife for pain and emotional suffering and €3,000 for legal expenses. In August 2010, Tapola made a 15th request for divorce.

===Assault incident===
On 24 August 2004, Nykänen was arrested on suspicion of attempted manslaughter of a family friend after losing a finger pulling competition in Tottijärvi, Nokia. In October 2004, he was found guilty of aggravated assault, and sentenced to 26 months in prison. As it was a first offence, he was released in September 2005.

===As an entertainer===

When Nykänen&#x27;s ski jumping career was drawing to a close, a group of businessmen proposed to make him a singer. His first album &quot;Yllätysten yö (Night of surprises)&quot; was released in 1992 and sold over 25,000 copies. Nykänen became the second Olympic gold medalist after Tapio Rautavaara to be awarded a &quot;golden record&quot; in Finland. His next album &quot;Samurai&quot; (1993) was not as successful.

At the end of the 1990s, due to serious financial problems, Nykänen worked as a stripper in a Järvenpää restaurant. The restaurateur was reproached for exploitation of Nykänen.

In 2002, Nykänen made a comeback as a singer and released the single &quot;Ehkä otin, ehkä en&quot; (&quot;Maybe I took [it], maybe I didn&#x27;t&quot;). He also gave his name to a cider brand with the same advertisement slogan. In 2006 Nykänen released his third studio album &quot;Ehkä otin, ehkä en (Maybe I took it, maybe I didn&#x27;t)&quot;. During most of his musical career, Nykänen worked with professional musician Jussi Niemi. Nykänen toured Finland performing two to three times a week with the &quot;Samurai&quot; ensemble led by Niemi.

Many of Nykänen&#x27;s singles were named after some (in)famous quotes by Nykänen, such as &quot;Elämä on laiffii&quot; (&quot;Life is life&quot;), &quot;Jokainen tsäänssi on mahdollisuus&quot; (&quot;Every chance is a possibility&quot;), and &quot;Ehkä otin, ehkä en&quot;.

In November 2009, Nykänen began to present his own cooking web series &quot;Mattihan se sopan keitti (Matti cooked the soup)&quot;.

===ADHD diagnosis===
In the early 2000s, Nykänen was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

== Death ==
Matti Nykänen died at his home in Lappeenranta, shortly after midnight on 4 February 2019, from a sudden illness, at the age of 55. He had complained of dizziness and nausea earlier that night. He had been diagnosed with diabetes less than three months earlier. The news of his death was widely reported by the media both in Finland and abroad, with many tributes also paid to him by fellow ski jumpers of his time. He was survived by his fifth wife and three children, two from previous relationships and one outside of marriage. In May 2019 Nykänen&#x27;s sisters confirmed that the cause of death was pancreatitis and pneumonia.

==In popular culture==
*In 1988 DPR Korea issued a postage stamp depicting Nykänen in the flight during competition.
*In 2016, Swedish actor Edvin Endre portrayed Nykänen, in the British biographical sports film &quot;Eddie the Eagle&quot;.

==Biographies==

*A film about the life of Nykänen, simply entitled &quot;&quot;, was released in 2006 with Finnish actor Jasper Pääkkönen cast as Nykänen. The movie focused on Nykänen&#x27;s exploits beyond ski jumping.

<text>Ernest Charles Drury (January 22, 1878 – February 17, 1968) was a farmer, politician and writer who served as the eighth premier of Ontario, from 1919 to 1923 as the head of a United Farmers of Ontario–Labour coalition government.

Drury was the first premier of Ontario to have been born in the province after confederation.

==Family==
Drury was the grandson of Richard Drury, who arrived in Crown Hill, Ontario, from Kenilworth, Warwickshire, England, in 1819.

His father, Charles Alfred Drury, continued the family farm and was a forward-looking farmer, who used new techniques and technologies. In 1882, he was president of the Agricultural and Arts Association of Ontario. He also served as reeve of Oro Township, in Simcoe County, for 13 years and was elected to the Ontario Legislature as an Ontario Liberal Party member. He served from 1882 to 1890, the last two years as Ontario&#x27;s first Minister of Agriculture.

==Early career==
Drury was an Opposition candidate in Simcoe North in the 1917 wartime election, which was held during the Conscription Crisis of 1917, but was defeated by the Government candidate. Conscription was the over-riding issue in this election; Drury believed that conscription was a &quot;necessary evil,&quot; and always insisted that if men be drafted, so too should wealth be conscripted through heavier taxation.

==Premier of Ontario==

Drury was a co-founder of the UFO in 1913 but did not run in the 1919 election, which returned farmer candidates as the largest bloc in the provincial legislature. Not having a leader, the UFO Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) asked Drury to lead them and take the position of Premier. The UFOs 49 MLAs joined with 11 Labour members to form a coalition government. It was the first of a wave of United Farmers governments that took power in several provinces and that founded the Progressive Party of Canada. 

Drury was elected to the Legislative Assembly in Halton in a 1920 by-election, after John Featherstone Ford, the sitting UFO MLA, had stepped aside. Drury faced Edward Stephenson of the Soldier Party (with both Liberals and Conservatives declining to contest the seat) and emerged victorious with 67.7% of the vote. Stephenson was critical of Drury&#x27;s qualified support of conscription in 1917, but Drury acquitted himself well before the voters. 

===Achievements===

The Drury government had a significant impact on the Province:

* It introduced allowances for widows and children, a minimum wage for women, a mandatory weekly day of rest, broadened workmen&#x27;s compensation benefits improved the support mechanisms for parents and children born out of wedlock, and standardized adoption procedures.
* Ontario Hydro saw greater expansion in the field of rural electrification and in 1921, Hydro acquired the Toronto Electric Light Company, together with various railway interests, thus making it the largest electric power system in the world.
* The Province of Ontario Savings Office was created, effectively a provincially-owned bank that was designed to lend money to farmers at a lower rate.
* It began the first major reforestation program in North America, and initiated construction of the modern highway system.
* Drury also arranged for a grant to Frederick Banting and Charles Best, at that time relatively unknown researchers, as a result of their discovery of insulin.

===Temperance controversies===
The government was also a strict enforcer of temperance measures, amidst mixed publicity. The newly-elected Labour MLA George Grant Halcrow was immediately convicted of violating the &quot;Ontario Temperance Act&quot;, which prevented him from receiving an expected appointment to the Cabinet. He became House Leader for the Labour Party but found himself at odds with Attorney-General William Raney over temperance by admitting, &quot;I was an out-and-out wet in the Legislature.&quot;

When police and liquor officials were authorized to search automobiles and private yachts for illegal liquor, &quot;The Toronto Telegram&quot; observed that the only means of transportation where citizens could be free from search were &quot;balloons and submarines&quot;. Another Act was passed which effectively prevented any movement of liquor within the Province, but it was later held not to prohibit exports to the United States.

In 1920, Reverend J. O. L. Spracklin, a Provincial Temperance enforcer, shot and killed an illicit liquor trader. The pastor, a strongly zealous and articulate personality, was acquitted of manslaughter, but the resultant publicity, generally linked with a major professed aim of Drury&#x27;s administration, served to call the aim of rigorous temperance enforcement into question in the minds of many Ontarians.

===Ontario Hydro===
Dougall Carmichael, appointed as Minister without Portfolio, was given the responsibility of being the government representative on the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, and specifically with keeping its chairman Adam Beck in line. At one point in 1922, Carmichael announced to the Legislature that he was quitting his position as Commissioner because Hydro &quot;was either inefficient or dishonest&quot;. He was forced to retract the allegation of dishonesty, and continued to be a Commissioner until the following year.

In 1920, responding to a campaign to have Hydro&#x27;s rates made uniform, a Legislature committee headed by John G. Lethbridge proposed a levy of $2 per on all electricity generated in the province in order to subsidize up to 80% of construction costs on rural transmission lines (whenever there was an average of three customers per mile of line). Beck rejected the idea of a levy, but put forward his own plan (which generated great controversy). An Act that favoured Beck&#x27;s view, through subsidizing up to 50% of construction costs in the rural power zone, was passed in 1921, which effectively tightened Hydro&#x27;s control over public distributors and denied payments to private electricity producers.

Hydro&#x27;s plans for the promotion of interurban railways were significantly scaled back after the Sutherland Commission&#x27;s report on the subject recommended it in 1921, and its affairs in general were the subject of the Gregory Commission appointed in 1922.

By battling with Beck and his plans for expansion of the province&#x27;s hydro-electric system, Drury also alienated industrialists and many workers.

===Forest policy===
The Drury government investigated the administration of forest concessions granted under the previous Hearst administration, which had been directed by its minister Howard Ferguson, and passed an Act to provide for corrective measures with regard to permits that had been improperly issued.

A particular issue with Ferguson&#x27;s previous actions was that he had sold timber limits to the Shevlin-Clarke Lumber Company (headed by fellow Conservative James Arthur Mathieu) for less than half the price they would have normally fetched, and the company later paid a fine of $1.5 million for breaching the &quot;Crown Timber Act&quot;. This transaction, as well as others, were criticized in a subsequent inquiry by the Latchford-Riddell Commission, which reported:

Despite the amount of evidence gathered about the improper administration of forest lands (including Ferguson&#x27;s self-professed arrogance in the matter) and the recommendations given as to how it should be improved, the industry and Ferguson launched a vigorous attack against the United Farmers. Ferguson described the Commission as &quot;claptrap political conspiracy&quot;, accused Drury and Raney of &quot;political knavery&quot;, and the UFO as &quot;intellectual and political freaks who were projected into prominence by accident and who grew out of garbage&quot;. This scuttled any attempts at reform and helped to contribute to their later downfall.

===Other difficulties===
Many labour leaders distrusted a government dominated by farmers, feeling that they could not understand the problems of urban workers. Drury&#x27;s failure to establish fair wage provisions in government contracts and his commitment to free trade that threatened the livelihood of industrial workers alienated urban workers further.

The government was also harmed by the Ontario Bond Scandal that resulted in Provincial Treasurer Peter Smith being jailed.

The government was opposed by all the major newspapers in the province, with the exception of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, and, despite its attempt to broaden its base, was opposed by business.

===Fall from power===
The government under Drury tried to be a &quot;people&#x27;s government&quot; rather than a &quot;class government&quot;, but in so doing, alienated the base of its support, particularly farmers. In a series of erratic events, the UFO government clashed with the uncooperative UFO organization (led by James J. Morrison throughout Drury&#x27;s term) which ultimately withdrew its support.

The Drury government collapsed after it introduced bills in the Legislature that would have brought in proportional representation and a preferential ballot and Drury called an early election. The government was defeated when it ran for re-election in the 1923 provincial election, in part, due to false claims that Drury had used $100 to purchase a new coal scuttle for his personal use. In fact, the device was an old scuttle which had been retrieved from storage and polished up. Drury never responded to the false claim, however, and it contributed to opposition claims of the government&#x27;s extravagance.

==Later life==
Drury retired from politics but later ran as a federal candidate. Unlike many other members of the UFO, he never joined either the Liberal Party of Canada or the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation.

Drury was active with the Progressive Party of Canada following the demise of his provincial government. He ran as a Progressive candidate in Simcoe North in the 1925 Canadian federal election, 1926 and 1930 federal elections but was defeated by Conservative candidates by margins of 600, 200 and 800 votes respectively.

===Local government===
In 1934, he was appointed sheriff and registrar of Simcoe County, a position which he held until 1959. A portrait of Drury is still displayed prominently at the local courthouse in Barrie.

===Writings===
He wrote for magazines such as &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; and also wrote two local histories of Simcoe County. He did not write his memoirs until 1966.

In June 2019, the city of Barrie published a poem of Drury’s entitled &quot;An Ode to Freedom in Canada&quot; along with interviews with his descendants on a website called Barrie Today.com.

Drury remained interested in political matters. During the debate on whether or not Canada should install American-operated nuclear-tipped Bomarc missiles in the 1960s, Drury wrote &quot;the next government of Canada... should refuse to accept nuclear arms. The whole nuclear program of the United States is dangerous.&quot;
==Recognition==
In 2011, the Ontario Heritage Trust erected a marker at Drury&#x27;s gravesite, as part of its Premiers&#x27; Gravesites Program.

There was a secondary school, E. C. Drury High School, which was closed and replaced by Craig Kielburger Secondary School in 2012. The provincial E. C. Drury School for the Deaf is still in operation in Milton, Ontario.

<doc id="484748" wikidata="Q7379989" url="?curid=484748" title="Running Start">
<text>Running Start is a dual credit enrollment program in Washington, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Montana and Illinois which allows high school juniors and seniors to attend college courses numbered 100 or above, while completing high school. It is similar to other dual enrollment programs common at public and private colleges and universities in other states like Concurrent Enrollment or Dual Enrollment. Running Start credits are held in equally high regard as Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate.

== History ==
Washington State implemented their Running Start program in 1993. Following Washington State was New Hampshire in 1999, Montana in 2001, Hawaii in 2007, and Illinois in 2012. Running Start and Dual Enrollment Programs across the United States have seen a huge increase in enrollment. Washington State has seen a 56 percent increase in enrollment in the past ten years and had over 26,000 students enrolled in the 2016–2017 school year. Across the United States there are an estimated 2 million high school students enrolled in a dual enrollment program.

==Washington State==
The Running Start program in Washington state was piloted in the early 1990s and officially approved to begin in the fall of 1993.

Running Start provides up to two years of paid tuition at any of Washington&#x27;s community and technical colleges, and at Central Washington University, Eastern Washington University, Washington State University, and Northwest Indian College. High school juniors who can pass the entrance exam for a local community college may take part or all of their coursework at the community college. Successfully passing a course earns a student both high school and college credit.

Running Start students can complete a substantial number of their first two years of college credits early. After high school, they pay for fewer community college credits before moving on to four-year institutions; it is possible for a motivated student to earn both a high school diploma and certain two-year college associate&#x27;s degrees simultaneously.

New state regulations took effect on July 26, 2011, limiting Running Start students to a 1.0 FTE (full-time equivalent) limit for high school or higher education courses each, and a 1.2 FTE limit for both institutions combined. (1.0 FTE is equivalent to 15 college credits, or 1,500 high school weekly minutes of instruction). Students who wish to take more than 15 college credits may pay the regular tuition rate and still receive dual credit. Fee waiver for additional credits might be available if the student belongs to low-income family (e.g., enrolled in free or reduced lunch program in high school).

While tuition is paid for by the student&#x27;s current school district, students have to pay fees, purchase textbooks, and provide transportation for themselves.

== University of Hawaii ==
Open to most high school juniors and seniors, Running Start allows students to receive credit with their public high school as well as receive college credit from the University of Hawaii. Unlike Washington, tuition is sometimes charged, with costs varying from school to school. GEAR UP Hawaii currently offers a limited number of scholarships who currently receive free or reduced lunch. In order to participate in Running Start, students must first receive parental consent, complete an online application, have up-to-date vaccinations, take a placement test, and complete a TB test.

== Criticism ==
Statistics from 2016–2017 have showed that Running Start is not as effective as Advanced Placement in reaching low-income families. Fewer than 5 percent of Running Start students were from low-income families, compared with 13 percent of Advanced Placement classes. Demographically speaking, the Running Start program has been credited as having made a notable impact, as a study done in Texas revealed that 5 percent of African-American students credit stemmed from concurrent enrollment and white students credit was double that as of 2016. Since the popularity of dual enrollment programs such as Running Start, college professors are noting a decrease of middle-class American students in their classrooms. Concurrent enrollment is similar to dual enrollment in that the student will receive college and high school credit but concurrent enrollment involves staying at a high school campus and is significantly cheaper. Both programs are capable of reducing a mass amount of money that would otherwise go into years spent at university, although concurrent enrollment eliminates certain fees that a student would have to pay in Running Start.

<text>Léon Philippe Teisserenc de Bort (5 November 1855 in Paris, France – 2 January 1913 in Cannes, France) was a French meteorologist and a pioneer in the field of aerology. Together with Richard Assmann (1845-1918), he is credited as co-discoverer of the stratosphere, as both men announced their discovery during the same time period in 1902. 
Teisserenc de Bort pioneered the use of unmanned instrumented balloons and was the first to identify the region in the atmosphere around 8-17 kilometers of height where the lapse rate reaches zero, known today as the tropopause.

==Early life and career==
He was the son of an engineer. He began his scientific career in 1880, when he entered the meteorological department of the Bureau Central Météorologique (Administrative Centre of National Meteorology, a department of the French government) in Paris under E. E. N. Mascart. In 1883, 1885 and 1887 he made journeys to North Africa to study geology and terrestrial magnetism, and during this period published some important charts of the distribution of pressure at a height of 4,000 metres. Between 1892 and 1896, Teisserenc de Bort was chief meteorologist to the Bureau.

==Instrumented balloons pioneer==
After his resignation from the Bureau in 1896, he established a private meteorological observatory in Trappes near Versailles. There he carried out investigations on clouds and the problems of the upper air. He conducted experiments with high-flying instrumented hydrogen balloons and was one of the first people to use such devices.

In 1898, Teisserenc de Bort published an important paper in &quot;Comptes Rendus&quot; detailing his researches by means of balloons into the constitution of the atmosphere. He noticed that while the air temperature decreased steadily up to approximately 11 kilometers of height, it remained constant above that altitude (up to the highest points he could reach). In other words, he discovered an indication of a temperature inversion or at least of a zero lapse rate above this altitude. For many years he was uncertain whether he discovered a true physical phenomenon or whether his measurements suffered from a systematic bias (indeed, the first measurements &quot;did&quot; have a positive temperature bias as the instruments were liable to radiative heating by solar radiation). That is why Teisserenc de Bort carried out 200+ more balloon experiments (with a substantial part of them being held during the night to eliminate radiative heating) until 1902, when he suggested that the atmosphere was divided into two layers.

==Troposphere and stratosphere==
During the years that followed, he named the two layers of the atmosphere known as the &quot;troposphere&quot; and the &quot;stratosphere&quot;. This naming convention has since been maintained, with (higher-altitude) layers that were subsequently discovered being given names of this sort. After Teisserenc de Bort&#x27;s death in 1913, the heirs donated the observatory to the state so that the research tasks could be continued.

==Additional investigations==
He also carried out investigations near Viborg in Denmark 1902-1903, in Sweden and over the Zuider Zee, the Mediterranean and the tropical region of the Atlantic, and fitted out a special vessel in order to study the currents above the trade winds. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society in 1903, honorary member in 1909, and was awarded the Symons Gold Medal of the Society in 1908. He collaborated with Hugo Hildebrandsson in &quot;Les bases de la météorologie dynamique&quot; (1907).

==Named after him==
* The crater Teisserenc on the Moon.
* The crater Teisserenc de Bort on Mars.

<text>A process theory is a system of ideas that explains how an entity changes and develops. Process theories are often contrasted with variance theories, that is, systems of ideas that explain the variance in a dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. While process theories focus on how something happens, variance theories focus on why something happens. Examples of process theories include evolution by natural selection, continental drift and the nitrogen cycle.

==Process theory archetypes==

Process theories come in four common archetypes. Evolutionary process theories explain change in a population through variation, selection and retention—much like biological evolution. In a dialectic process theory, “stability and change are explained by reference to the balance of power between opposing entities” (p. 517). In a teleological process theory, an agent “constructs an envisioned end state, takes action to reach it and monitors the progress” (p. 518). In a lifecycle process theory, “the trajectory to the final end state is prefigured and requires a particular historical sequence of events” (p. 515); that is, change always conforms to the same series of activities, stages, phases, like a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly.

==Applications and examples==
Process theories are important in management and software engineering. Process theories are used to explain how decisions are made how software is designed and how software processes are improved.

Motivation theories can be classified broadly into two different perspectives: Content and Process theories. 
*Content theories deal with &quot;“what”&quot; motivates people and it is concerned with individual needs and goals. Maslow, Alderfer, Herzberg and McClelland studied motivation from a “content” perspective. 
*Process theories deal with the “process” of motivation and are concerned with &quot;“how”&quot; motivation occurs. Vroom, Porter &amp; Lawler, Adams and Locke studied motivation from a “process” perspective.

Process theories are also used in education, psychology, geology and many other fields; however, they are not always called &quot;process theories&quot;.

<doc id="484766" wikidata="Q7714247" url="?curid=484766" title="Well of Souls">
<text>The Well of Souls (; sometimes translated Pit of Souls, Cave of Spirits, or Well of Spirits), is a partly natural, partly man-made cave located inside the Foundation Stone (&quot;Noble Rock&quot; in Islam) under the Dome of the Rock shrine on the Temple Mount (Haram al-Sharif) in Jerusalem. During the Crusader period, it was known to Christians as the &quot;Holy of Holies&quot;, referring to the inner sanctum of the former Jewish Temple, which, according to modern scholarship, was probably located on top of the Foundation Stone.

The name &quot;Well of Souls&quot; derives from a medieval Islamic legend that at this place the spirits of the dead can be heard awaiting Judgment Day, although this is not a mainstream view in Sunni Islam. The name has also been applied to a depression in the floor of this cave and a hypothetical chamber that may exist beneath it.

==History and context==
===Judaism and Islam===
The Well of Souls is located under the Foundation Stone, an exposed bedrock which lies directly under the Dome of the Rock. The Dome of the Rock stands on the location of the destroyed Second Jewish Temple (built around 516 BCE to replace Solomon&#x27;s Temple), which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. In traditional Jewish sources, the Foundation Stone is considered the place from which the creation of the world began, and where Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac.

In Islam, the Foundation Stone is known as the Noble Rock. Al-Tabari, a Muslim writer of the 9th century CE, identified the rock with the place where the Romans had &quot;buried the temple [] at the time of the sons of Israel.&quot; Some modern Muslims believe it to be the spot from which Muhammad ascended to heaven during his (Isra and Mi&#x27;raj, &#x27;Night Journey&#x27;). According to a medieval Islamic tradition, the Foundation Stone tried to follow Muhammad as he ascended, leaving his footprint here while pulling up and hollowing out the cave below. The impression of the hand of the Archangel Gabriel, made as he restrained the Stone from rising, is nearby.

Both Jewish and Muslim traditions relate to what may lie beneath the Foundation Stone, the earliest of them found in the Talmud in the former and understood to date to the 12th and 13th centuries in the latter. The Talmud indicates that the Stone marks the center of the world and serves as a cover for the Abyss () containing the raging waters of the Flood. The cave was venerated as early as 902 according to Ibn al-Faqih. Muslim tradition likewise places it at the center of the world and over a bottomless pit with the flowing waters of Paradise underneath. A palm tree is said to grow out of the River of Paradise here to support the Stone. Noah is said to have landed here after the Flood. The souls of the dead are said to be audible here as they await the Last Judgment, although this is not a mainstream view in Sunni Islam.

===Crusader period===
The Foundation Stone and its cave entered fully into the Christian tradition after the Crusaders conquered Jerusalem in 1099. These Europeans converted the Dome of the Rock into a church, calling it in (the &#x27;Temple of the Lord&#x27;). They made many radical physical changes to the site at this time, including cutting away much of the rock to make staircases and paving the Stone over with marble slabs. The main entrance of the cave was enlarged, and Europeans of the Crusades are probably also responsible for creating the shaft ascending from the center of the chamber. The Crusaders called the cave the &quot;Holy of Holies&quot; and venerated it as the site of the archangel&#x27;s announcement of John the Baptist&#x27;s birth. Modern scholarship indicates that the Holy of Holies of the Jewish Temple was probably on top of the Foundation Stone, not inside it.

==Legends and old interpretations==
In 1871, Jerusalem was visited by the explorer and Arabist Sir Richard Francis Burton. Burton&#x27;s wife Isabel later described their exploration of the Well of Souls as tourists:

==Description==
===The entrance===
The entrance to the cave is at the southeast angle of the Foundation Stone, beside the southeast pier of the Dome of the Rock shrine. Here a set of 16 new marble steps descend through a cut passage thought to date to Crusader times. On the way down, bedrock masses project in towards the stair; the one to the right is called &quot;the tongue&quot;. (According to legend, the Stone answered &#x27;Caliph &#x27;Umar I&#x27; when he addressed it.)

===The chamber===
The cave chamber is roughly square, about on a side, and ranges from around high.

Inside the chamber are four prayer niches. As one descends, next to the staircase there are two (prayer niches): to the left (south) is one dedicated to Prophet Dawud (David), with a trefoil arch supported by miniature marble twisted-rope columns. To the right (southeast) is a shallower, but ornately decorated, prayer niche dedicated to the prophet Suleiman (Solomon). This is certainly one of the oldest in the world, considered to date at least to the late 9th century, with some even suggesting that it dates back to the 7th century and to the time of Abd al-Malik, builder of the Dome of the Rock—making it the oldest in the world—but this is disputed. To the north is a small shrine dedicated to prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and to the northwest another one dedicated to Khidr-Elijah. A depression in the floor of the cave elicits an echo, which may indicate a chamber beneath it.

The chamber is supplied with electric lighting and fans.

===The shaft===
At the center of the ceiling is a shaft, in diameter, which penetrates up to the surface of the Stone above. It has been proposed that this is the 4,000-year-old remnant of a shaft tomb. Another theory is that it represents a Crusader &quot;chimney&quot; cut for ventilation to accommodate lighted shrine candles. Still others have tried to make a case that it was part of a drainage system for the blood of sacrifices from the Temple altar. There are no rope marks within the shaft, so it has been concluded that it was never used as a well, with the cave as a cistern. The ceiling of the cave appears natural, while the floor has been long ago paved with marble and carpeted over.

==Literature==
* The earliest reference to a &quot;pierced rock&quot; (the shaft in the cave&#x27;s roof) may be that in the by the anonymous &quot;Pilgrim of Bordeaux&quot; who visited Jerusalem in 333 CE.
* References to the &quot;Well of Souls&quot; under the Foundation Stone date at least to the 10th-century Persian writer Ibn al-Faqih who mentions it as an Islamic sacred site. 
* The 11th-century Persian writer and traveler Nasir-i Khusraw related the traditional story of the origin of the cave in his classic travelogue :
* The 16th-century rabbi David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra said there was a cave under the Dome of the Rock called the &quot;Well of Souls&quot;.

<text>The Ginger Group was not a formal political party in Canada, but a faction of radical Progressive and Labour Members of Parliament who advocated socialism. The term ginger group also refers to a small group with new, radical ideas trying to act as a catalyst within a larger body.

The Ginger Group split with the Progressive Party in 1924 when Progressive leader Robert Forke proved too eager to accommodate the Liberal government of William Lyon Mackenzie King and agreed to support the government&#x27;s budget with only minimal concessions. J. S. Woodsworth, using his right as the leader of the Independent Labour MPs, moved a stronger amendment to the budget based on demands the Progressives had made in earlier years but had since abandoned. The Progressive and Labour MPs who broke with their Progressive colleagues to support Woodsworth became the &quot;Ginger Group&quot;. It was made up of United Farmers of Alberta MPs George Gibson Coote, Robert Gardiner, Edward Joseph Garland, Donald MacBeth Kennedy and Henry Elvins Spencer as well as United Farmers of Ontario MP Agnes Macphail. The group was later joined by Labour MPs J. S. Woodsworth, William Irvine, Abraham Albert Heaps and Angus MacInnis, independent MP Joseph Tweed Shaw and Progressive MPs Milton Neil Campbell, William John Ward, William Charles Good, and Preston Elliott.

Members of the Ginger Group played a role in forming the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation in 1932, with Woodsworth becoming the new party&#x27;s leader.

The only sitting United Farmers of Alberta who did not join the CCF at its founding was William Thomas Lucas, who ran for re-election unsuccessfully as a Conservative in 1935.

The name Ginger Group was also used to refer to a group of Conservative MPs who, in 1917 opposed Prime Minister Robert Borden&#x27;s use of the Military Service Act to introduce conscription during the Conscription Crisis of 1917.

<text>Xico is a city located in the central part of the Mexican state of Veracruz. It produces coffee, tropical fruit, wine, handicrafts, and other products. A regional special dish is their variant of mole known as Mole Xico or Xiqueño which consists of 25+ ingredients and is comparatively sweeter to other dark moles such as mole poblano due to the use of more fruits. It is 25 km from the state capital Xalapa.
Every year in July, Xico has a very large bullfighting event. In 2006, Veracruz Governor Fidel Herrera attended the event. 

Three kilometres outside the town is Cascada de Texolo.

<doc id="484778" wikidata="Q1462316" url="?curid=484778" title="Spurious relationship">
<text>In statistics, a spurious relationship or spurious correlation is a mathematical relationship in which two or more events or variables are associated but &quot;not&quot; causally related, due to either coincidence or the presence of a certain third, unseen factor (referred to as a &quot;common response variable&quot;, &quot;confounding factor&quot;, or &quot;lurking variable&quot;).

== Examples ==
An example of a spurious relationship can be found in the time-series literature, where a spurious regression is one that provides misleading statistical evidence of a linear relationship between independent non-stationary variables. In fact, the non-stationarity may be due to the presence of a unit root in both variables. In particular, any two nominal economic variables are likely to be correlated with each other, even when neither has a causal effect on the other, because each equals a real variable times the price level, and the common presence of the price level in the two data series imparts correlation to them. (See also spurious correlation of ratios.)

Another example of a spurious relationship can be seen by examining a city&#x27;s ice cream sales. The sales might be highest when the rate of drownings in city swimming pools is highest. To allege that ice cream sales cause drowning, or vice versa, would be to imply a spurious relationship between the two. In reality, a heat wave may have caused both. The heat wave is an example of a hidden or unseen variable, also known as a confounding variable.

Another commonly noted example is a series of Dutch statistics showing a positive correlation between the number of storks nesting in a series of springs and the number of human babies born at that time. Of course there was no causal connection; they were correlated with each other only because of two independent coincidences. During the Pagan era, which can be traced back at least to medieval times more than 600 years ago, it was common for couples to wed during the annual summer solstice, because summer was associated with fertility. At the same time, storks would commence their annual migration, flying all the way from Europe to Africa. The birds would then return the following spring — exactly nine months later.

In rare cases, a spurious relationship can occur between two completely unrelated variables without any confounding variable, as was the case between the success of the Washington Commanders professional football team in a specific game before each presidential election and the success of the incumbent President&#x27;s political party in said election. For 16 consecutive elections between 1940 and 2000, the Redskins Rule correctly matched whether the incumbent President&#x27;s political party would retain or lose the Presidency. The rule eventually failed shortly after Elias Sports Bureau discovered the correlation in 2000; in 2004, 2012 and 2016, the results of the Commanders&#x27; game and the election did not match. In a similar spurious relationship involving the National Football League, in the 1970s, Leonard Koppett noted a correlation between the direction of the stock market and the winning conference of that year&#x27;s Super Bowl, the Super Bowl indicator; the relationship maintained itself for most of the 20th century before reverting to more random behavior in the 21st.

==Hypothesis testing==

Often one tests a null hypothesis of no correlation between two variables, and chooses in advance to reject the hypothesis if the correlation computed from a data sample would have occurred in less than (say) 5% of data samples if the null hypothesis were true. While a true null hypothesis will be accepted 95% of the time, the other 5% of the times having a true null of no correlation a zero correlation will be wrongly rejected, causing acceptance of a correlation which is spurious (an event known as Type I error). Here the spurious correlation in the sample resulted from random selection of a sample that did not reflect the true properties of the underlying population.

==Detecting spurious relationships==

The term &quot;spurious relationship&quot; is commonly used in statistics and in particular in experimental research techniques, both of which attempt to understand and predict direct causal relationships (X → Y). A non-causal correlation can be spuriously created by an antecedent which causes both (W → X and W → Y). Mediating variables, (X → M → Y), if undetected, estimate a total effect rather than direct effect without adjustment for the mediating variable M. Because of this, experimentally identified correlations do not represent causal relationships unless spurious relationships can be ruled out.

===Experiments===

In experiments, spurious relationships can often be identified by controlling for other factors, including those that have been theoretically identified as possible confounding factors. For example, consider a researcher trying to determine whether a new drug kills bacteria; when the researcher applies the drug to a bacterial culture, the bacteria die. But to help in ruling out the presence of a confounding variable, another culture is subjected to conditions that are as nearly identical as possible to those facing the first-mentioned culture, but the second culture is not subjected to the drug. If there is an unseen confounding factor in those conditions, this control culture will die as well, so that no conclusion of efficacy of the drug can be drawn from the results of the first culture. On the other hand, if the control culture does not die, then the researcher cannot reject the hypothesis that the drug is efficacious.

===Non-experimental statistical analyses===

Disciplines whose data are mostly non-experimental, such as economics, usually employ observational data to establish causal relationships. The body of statistical techniques used in economics is called econometrics. The main statistical method in econometrics is multivariable regression analysis. Typically a linear relationship such as

:formula_1

is hypothesized, in which formula_2 is the dependent variable (hypothesized to be the caused variable), formula_3 for &quot;j&quot; = 1, ..., &quot;k&quot; is the &quot;j&quot;th independent variable (hypothesized to be a causative variable), and formula_4 is the error term (containing the combined effects of all other causative variables, which must be uncorrelated with the included independent variables). If there is reason to believe that none of the formula_3s is caused by &quot;y&quot;, then estimates of the coefficients formula_6 are obtained. If the null hypothesis that formula_7 is rejected, then the alternative hypothesis that formula_8 and equivalently that formula_3 causes &quot;y&quot; cannot be rejected. On the other hand, if the null hypothesis that formula_7 cannot be rejected, then equivalently the hypothesis of no causal effect of formula_3 on &quot;y&quot; cannot be rejected. Here the notion of causality is one of contributory causality: If the true value formula_12, then a change in formula_3 will result in a change in &quot;y&quot; &quot;unless&quot; some other causative variable(s), either included in the regression or implicit in the error term, change in such a way as to exactly offset its effect; thus a change in formula_3 is &quot;not sufficient&quot; to change &quot;y&quot;. Likewise, a change in formula_3 is &quot;not necessary&quot; to change &quot;y&quot;, because a change in &quot;y&quot; could be caused by something implicit in the error term (or by some other causative explanatory variable included in the model).

Regression analysis controls for other relevant variables by including them as regressors (explanatory variables). This helps to avoid mistaken inference of causality due to the presence of a third, underlying, variable that influences both the potentially causative variable and the potentially caused variable: its effect on the potentially caused variable is captured by directly including it in the regression, so that effect will not be picked up as a spurious effect of the potentially causative variable of interest. In addition, the use of multivariate regression helps to avoid wrongly inferring that an indirect effect of, say &quot;x&quot;1 (e.g., &quot;x&quot;1 → &quot;x&quot;2 → &quot;y&quot;) is a direct effect (&quot;x&quot;1 → &quot;y&quot;).

Just as an experimenter must be careful to employ an experimental design that controls for every confounding factor, so also must the user of multiple regression be careful to control for all confounding factors by including them among the regressors. If a confounding factor is omitted from the regression, its effect is captured in the error term by default, and if the resulting error term is correlated with one (or more) of the included regressors, then the estimated regression may be biased or inconsistent (see omitted variable bias).

In addition to regression analysis, the data can be examined to determine if Granger causality exists. The presence of Granger causality indicates both that &quot;x&quot; precedes &quot;y&quot;, and that &quot;x&quot; contains unique information about &quot;y&quot;.

<text>Burray () is one of the Orkney Islands in Scotland. It lies to the east of Scapa Flow and is one of a chain of islands linked by the Churchill Barriers.

==Geography and geology==
Burray lies between Mainland, Orkney and South Ronaldsay, and is linked to both by the Churchill Barriers. Barriers 1, 2, and 3 connect Burray with Mainland, Orkney via the islets of Glimps Holm and Lamb Holm in Holm Sound to the north east. Barrier 4 links to South Ronaldsay, across Water Sound. To the west is the tidal island of Hunda, also joined by a causeway. Further west, across Scapa Flow, are the islands of Flotta and Calf of Flotta, approximately away.

In 2001, the population of Burray was 357, a total that had grown to 409 by 2011. The main settlement, Burray Village, is a former fishing port on the south west coast. There are also settlements of Northtown, Southtown and Hillside on the island.

Burray is made up of Old Red Sandstone of the Devonian period. The island is indented in the north west by Echnaloch Bay, which takes its name from Echna Loch. Burray Ness and Burray Haas are two headlands in the east.

==Visitor attractions==
Attractions in Burray include the Fossil and Heritage Centre at Viewforth.

The island has a reasonable amount of birdlife, with Eurasian curlew, herring and lesser black-backed gulls breeding here.

==History==

===Viking history===
One of the largest Viking hoards in Scotland was discovered on 22 April 1889 by Mr G. Petrie, Little Wart, Burray when he was peat-cutting in the North Town Moss. It consisted of over 140 items of silver bullion, including many fragments of arm ring or &#x27;ring-money&#x27;, and about a dozen coins The date proposed for deposition is c. 998.

===Sir James Stewart===
During the early 18th century, the laird of Burray was one Sir James Stewart. Stewart is said to have been involved with a murder in Kirkwall in 1725, and went on the run for twenty years. A Jacobite sympathiser, he ended up fighting in the Battle of Culloden in 1746, and was one of the few survivors. However, when he returned to Burray after the battle, he happened to chance upon the son of the murder victim, who reported him to the authorities. Stewart was arrested, and ended up dying in a prison cell in London.

The novelist Mary Brunton was born Mary Balfour on Burray on 1 November 1778.

===WWII and construction of Churchill Barriers===
On 14 October 1939, the Royal Navy battleship was sunk at her moorings within the natural harbour of Scapa Flow, by the under the command of Günther Prien. &quot;U-47&quot; had entered Scapa Flow through Holm Sound, just to the north of Burray, one of several eastern entrances to Scapa Flow. The eastern passages were protected by measures including sunken block ships, booms and anti-submarine nets, but &quot;U-47&quot; entered at night at high tide by navigating between the block ships.
To prevent further attacks, the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill ordered the construction of permanent barriers. Work began in May 1940 and the barriers were completed in September 1944, but were not officially opened until 12 May 1945, four days after the end of World War II.

The Churchill Barriers project required a substantial labour force, which peaked in 1943 at over two thousand. Much of the labour was provided by around 1200 Italian prisoners of war, who had been captured in the desert war in North Africa, who were transported to Orkney from early 1942 onwards. As the use of POW labour for War Effort works is prohibited under the Geneva Conventions, the works were justified as &#x27;improvements to communications&#x27; to the southern Orkney Islands.

The prisoners were accommodated in two camps, some at Camp 34 at Warebanks on Burray and the rest at Camp 60 on Lamb Holm where the famous Italian Chapel was built. Camp 34 had its own chapel but this was destroyed at the end of the war with the rest of the camp. Photos exist of Camp 34&#x27;s football team and band.

<doc id="484786" wikidata="Q5437443" url="?curid=484786" title="Fatemeh Haghighatjoo">
<text>Fatemeh Haghighatjoo (also spelled Haghighatjou and Haqiqatju; ) is an Iranian scholar and reformist politician who represented Tehran, Rey, Shemiranat and Eslamshahr in the Iranian Parliament from 2000 to 2004. She left Iran in 2005 and currently resides in the United States, where she serves as the CEO and co-founder of the 501(c)(3) organization Nonviolent Initiative for Democracy (NID).

== Early life and education ==
Haghighatjoo was born in 1968 in southern Tehran, the second of four daughters, and comes from a traditionalist middle-class family. She lost her father in an accident when she was 6, and was brought up by her mother as a practising Muslim. She attended University of Tehran and Tarbiat Modarres University, gaining a degree in psychology and holding a Ph.D. in family counseling. She was a student activist with the Office for Strengthening Unity.

== Political career ==
Haghighatjoo worked for Mohammad Khatami&#x27;s presidential campaign, and joined Mosharekat party as a student leader. In 2000, she successfully ran for a seat in the Iranian Parliament and became the youngest female deputy.

An advocate of women&#x27;s rights, reforms and democracy, she contributed proposing a bill to join Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. She was charged with &quot;Tahrif&quot; of the words of Ayatollah Khomeini and insulting Ali Khamenei in 2001 for what she said in a speech in Qazvin, eventually convicted of the latter charge and sentenced to ten months suspended imprisonment.

On 23 February 2004, she resigned from the parliament on the grounds that she is no longer able to keep her oath of office and as a sign of protest to &quot;the incorrect, illegal and non-religious conduct of the appointed bodies [e.g. the Guardian Council and Judiciary] in recent years&quot;.

== Professional career ==
Haghighatjoo was a math teacher and then a counselor in a girls&#x27; high school, before being employed as a lecturer at University of Tehran and Shahid Beheshti University. She is also a former faculty member at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, and the University of Connecticut and has had fellowship positions at Kennedy School of Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s Center for International Studies.

== Views ==
She self-identifies as feminist. She told &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; in 2009 that she entered Parliament believing Islam and democracy could coexist; she left office believing in “separation of mosque and state.’’

== Personal life==
Haghighatjoo married a parliamentary correspondent, when she was 31 and serving her second year as a lawmaker. In August 2003, she gave birth to a girl, Sara Tahavori.

<text>USS &quot;President&quot; was a wooden-hulled, three-masted heavy frigate of the United States Navy, nominally rated at 44 guns; she was launched in April 1800 from a shipyard in New York City. &quot;President&quot; was one of the original six frigates whose construction the Naval Act of 1794 had authorized, and she was the last to be completed. The name &quot;President&quot; was among ten names submitted to President George Washington by Secretary of War Timothy Pickering in March of 1795 for the frigates that were to be constructed. Joshua Humphreys designed these frigates to be the young Navy&#x27;s capital ships, and so &quot;President&quot; and her sisters were larger and more heavily armed and built than standard frigates of the period. Forman Cheeseman, and later Christian Bergh, were in charge of her construction. Her first duties with the newly formed United States Navy were to provide protection for American merchant shipping during the Quasi War with France and to engage in a punitive expedition against the Barbary pirates in the First Barbary War.

On 16 May 1811, &quot;President&quot; was at the center of the Little Belt affair; her crew mistakenly identified as , which had impressed an American seaman. The ships exchanged cannon fire for several minutes. Subsequent U.S. and Royal Navy investigations placed responsibility for the attack on each other without a resolution. The incident contributed to tensions between the U.S. and Great Britain that led to the War of 1812.

During the war, &quot;President&quot; made several extended cruises, patrolling as far away as the English Channel and Norway; she captured the armed schooner and numerous merchant ships. In January 1815, after having been blockaded in New York for a year by the Royal Navy, &quot;President&quot; attempted to run the blockade, and was chased by a blockading squadron. During the chase, she was engaged and crippled by the frigate off the coast of the city. The British squadron captured &quot;President&quot; soon after, and the Royal Navy took her into service as HMS &quot;President&quot; until she was broken up in 1818. &quot;President&quot;″s design was copied and used to build the next in 1829.

==Design and construction==
During the 1790s, American merchant vessels began to fall prey to Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean, most notably from Algiers. Congress&#x27;s response was the Naval Act of 1794. The Act provided funds for the construction of six frigates; however, it included a clause stating that construction of the ships would cease if the United States agreed to peace terms with Algiers.

Joshua Humphreys&#x27; design was long on keel and narrow of beam (width) to allow for mounting very heavy guns. The design incorporated a diagonal scantling (rib) scheme to limit hogging (warping); the ships were given extremely heavy planking. This gave the hull greater strength than those of more lightly built frigates. Humphreys developed his design after realizing that the fledgling United States Navy could not match the navies of the European states for size. He therefore designed his frigates to be able to overpower other frigates, but with the speed to escape from a ship of the line.

George Washington named &quot;President&quot; in order to reflect a principle of the United States Constitution. In a report on progress of construction dated 12 December, 1795 her keel had been completed, laid on the blocks and bolted together, and many parts received. Also noted that a large schooner carrying frame pieces along with other cargo had wrecked on Cape Hatteras on an unspecified date and was lost with all of her cargo. In March 1796 a peace accord was announced between the United States and Algiers. Construction was suspended in accordance with the Naval Act of 1794. At the onset of the Quasi-War with France in 1798, funds were approved to complete her construction, and her keel was laid at a shipyard in New York City. Her original naval constructor was Forman Cheeseman and the superintendent was Captain Silas Talbot.

Based on experience Humphreys gained during construction of &quot;President&quot;″s sister ships, and , he instructed Cheeseman to make alterations to the frigate&#x27;s design. These included raising the gun deck by and moving the main mast further rearward. &quot;President&quot; was built to a length of between perpendiculars and a beam of .

Although construction was begun at New York in the shipyard of Foreman Cheesman, work on her was discontinued in 1796. Construction resumed in 1798, under Christian Bergh and naval constructor William Doughty.

===Armament===
&quot;President&quot;″s nominal rating was that of a 44-gun ship. However, she usually carried over 50 guns. and was pierced for 64. During her service in the War of 1812, &quot;President&quot; was armed with a battery of 55 guns: thirty-two 24-pounder (10.9 kg) cannon, twenty-two 42-pounder (19 kg) carronades, and one 18-pounder (8 kg) long gun.

During her Royal Navy service as HMS &quot;President&quot;, she was initially rated at 50 guns, although she was at this stage armed with 60 cannons—thirty 24-pounder guns (10.9 kg) on the upper deck, twenty-eight 42-pounder (19 kg) carronades on the spar deck, plus two more 24-pounder guns on the forecastle. In February 1817, she was again re-rated, this time to 60 guns.

Unlike modern Navy vessels, ships of this era had no permanent battery of guns. Guns were portable and were often exchanged between ships as situations warranted. Each commanding officer modified his vessel&#x27;s armaments to his liking, taking into consideration factors such as the overall tonnage of cargo, complement of personnel aboard, and planned routes to be sailed. Consequently, a vessel&#x27;s armament would change often during its career; permanent records of the changes were not generally kept.

==Quasi and First Barbary Wars==

&quot;President&quot; launched on 10 April 1800—the last of the original six frigates to do so. After her fitting out, she departed for Guadeloupe on 5 August with Captain Thomas Truxtun in command. She departed Sandy Hook on 5 September. On 16 September she recaptured British ship &quot;Ruth&quot; from a French privateer () that had captured her the day before. On 16 October she detained and sent into St. Kitts schooner &quot;Little George&quot; without papers, but flying a Swedish flag, to determine ownership. She conducted routine patrols during the latter part of the Quasi-War and made several recaptures of American merchant ships. Nevertheless, her service in this period was uneventful. She returned to the United States sighting the Cape Henry Lighthouse on 16 February, and was in Hampton Roads on 17 February. after a peace treaty with France was ratified on 3 February 1801.
During the Quasi-War, the United States paid tribute to the Barbary States to ensure that they would not seize or harass American merchant ships. In 1801 Yusuf Karamanli of Tripoli, dissatisfied with the amount of tribute in comparison to that paid to Algiers, demanded an immediate payment of $250,000. Thomas Jefferson responded by sending a squadron of warships to protect American merchant ships in the Mediterranean and to pursue peace with the Barbary States.

On 22 May, 1801 Capt. Truxton turned over command to Capt. Richard Dale. In May, &quot;Commodore&quot; Richard Dale selected &quot;President&quot; as his flagship for the assignment in the Mediterranean. Dale&#x27;s orders were to present a show of force off Algiers, Tripoli, and Tunis and maintain peace with promises of tribute. Dale was authorized to commence hostilities at his discretion if any Barbary State had declared war by the time of his arrival. Dale&#x27;s squadron consisted of &quot;President&quot;, , , and . She sailed 1 June, 1801 from Hampton Roads. The squadron arrived at Gibraltar on 1 July; &quot;President&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; quickly continued to Algiers, where their presence convinced the regent to withdraw threats he had made against American merchant ships. &quot;President&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; subsequently made appearances at Tunis and Tripoli before &quot;President&quot; arrived at Malta on 16 August to replenish drinking water supplies.

Blockading the harbor of Tripoli on 24 August, &quot;President&quot; captured a Greek vessel with Tripolitan soldiers aboard. Dale negotiated an exchange of prisoners that resulted in the release of several Americans held captive in Tripoli. &quot;President&quot; arrived at Gibraltar on 3 September. While anchored in Algeciras Bay on 22 October one of her boats was sent to Gibraltar, about 5 1/2 miles away, but capsized with all on board, except one, was lost. While leaving Mahón, under control of a Pilot, on 30 November, &quot;President&quot; struck a large rock while traveling at . The impact brought Dale on deck and he successfully navigated &quot;President&quot; out of danger. An inspection at Toulon revealed that the impact had twisted off a 16-17 foot section of the forward part of her keel, the lower stem was gone, and other damages. Repairs were finished on 15 January, 1802. &quot;President&quot; remained in the Mediterranean until 11 March 1802; She departed for the United States and arrived on 14 April and was placed &quot;in ordinary&quot;.

Although &quot;President&quot; remained in the United States, operations against the Barbary States continued. A second squadron assembled under the command of Richard Valentine Morris in . Morris&#x27; poor performance resulted in his recall and subsequent dismissal from the Navy in 1803. A third squadron assembled under the command of Edward Preble in ; by July 1804, they had fought the Battle of Tripoli Harbor.

===Second Barbary patrol===
On 21 March, 1804 The Secretary of the Navy ordered Lt. Cassin, supervisor of the Washington Navy Yard, to prepare her for sea.
In April 1804, President Jefferson decided to reinforce Preble&#x27;s squadron. &quot;President&quot;, &quot;Congress&quot;, &quot;Constellation&quot;, and &quot;Essex&quot; prepared to sail as soon as possible under the direction of Commodore Samuel Barron. Barron selected &quot;President&quot; as his flagship, but she required a new bowsprit and repairs to her masts and rigging. Some two months passed before the squadron was ready to sail. She arrived at Hampton Roads on 13 June. They departed in late June and arrived at Gibraltar on 12 August.

&quot;President&quot; left Gibraltar on 16 August with &quot;Constellation&quot;; the frigates paused at Malta before arriving off Tripoli on 10 September, joining &quot;Constitution&quot;, , and . Sighting three ships running the blockade of Tripoli, the squadron moved in to capture them; during the pursuit, a sudden change in wind direction caused &quot;President&quot; to collide with &quot;Constitution&quot;. The collision caused serious damage to &quot;Constitution&quot;″s stern, bow, and figurehead. Two of the captured ships were sent to Malta with &quot;Constitution&quot;; &quot;President&quot; sailed to Syracuse, Sicily, arriving on 27 August.

When Barron arrived in the Mediterranean, his seniority of rank over Preble entitled him to assume the duties of commodore. However, soon after replacing Preble, Barron went ashore at Syracuse in poor health and became bedridden. Under command of Captain George Cox, &quot;President&quot; began routine blockade duties of Tripoli during the winter months of 1804–05. In late April 1805, &quot;Constitution&quot; captured three ships off Tripoli. &quot;President&quot; escorted them to port at Malta before rejoining &quot;Constitution&quot;.

Barron&#x27;s fragile health necessitated his resignation; he passed command to John Rodgers in late May 1805. Barron ordered Cox to command &quot;Essex&quot;, and turned &quot;President&quot; over to his brother, James Barron, on 29 May. On 3 June, after the Battle of Derne, the U.S signed a peace treaty with Tripoli. &quot;President&quot; sailed for the United States on 13 July, carrying the ailing Barron and many sailors released from captivity in Tripoli.

==&quot;Little Belt&quot; Affair==

In 1807, the &quot;Chesapeake&quot;-&quot;Leopard&quot; Affair heightened tensions between the United States and Britain. In preparation for further hostilities, Congress began authorizing naval appropriations, and &quot;President&quot; recommissioned in 1809 under the command of Commodore John Rodgers. She made routine and uneventful patrols, mainly along the United States&#x27; eastern seaboard, until 1 May 1811, when the British frigate stopped the American brig &quot;Spitfire&quot; from New York and impressed a crewman.

Rodgers received orders to pursue &quot;Guerriere&quot;, and &quot;President&quot; sailed immediately from Fort Severn on 10 May. On 16 May, approximately northeast of Cape Henry, a lookout spotted a sail on the horizon. Closing to investigate, Rodgers determined the sail belonged to a warship, and raised signal flags to identify his ship. The unidentified ship, later learned to be —a 20-gun sixth rate—hoisted signal flags in return, but the hoist was not understood by &quot;President&quot;″s crew. &quot;Little Belt&quot; sailed southward and Rodgers, believing the ship to be &quot;Guerriere&quot;, pursued.

Darkness set in before the ships were within hailing distance, and Rodgers hailed twice, only to have the same question returned to him: &quot;What ship is that?&quot; According to Rodgers, immediately after the exchange of hails, &quot;Little Belt&quot; fired a shot that tore through &quot;President&quot;″s rigging. Rodgers returned fire. &quot;Little Belt&quot; promptly answered with three guns, and then a whole broadside. Rodgers ordered his gun crews to fire at will; several accurate broadsides heavily damaged &quot;Little Belt&quot; in return. After five minutes of firing, &quot;President&quot;″s crew realized their adversary was much smaller than a frigate and Rodgers ordered a cease fire. However, &quot;Little Belt&quot; fired again and &quot;President&quot; answered with more broadsides. After &quot;Little Belt&quot; became silent, &quot;President&quot; stood off and waited overnight. At dawn it was obvious that &quot;Little Belt&quot; was greatly damaged from the fight; Rodgers sent a boat over from &quot;President&quot; to offer assistance in repairing the damage. Her Captain, Arthur Bingham, acknowledged the damage; declining any help, he sailed to Halifax, Nova Scotia. &quot;President&quot; had one sailor slightly wounded in the exchange, while &quot;Little Belt&quot; suffered 31 killed or wounded.

Upon &quot;President&quot;″s return to port, the U.S. Navy launched an investigation into the incident. Gathering testimony from &quot;President&quot;″s officers and crewmen, they determined that &quot;Little Belt&quot; had fired the first shot in the encounter. In the Royal Navy investigation, Captain Bingham insisted that &quot;President&quot; had fired the first shot and continued firing for 45 minutes, rather than the five minutes Rodgers claimed. In all subsequent reports, both captains continually insisted that the other ship had fired the first shot. Reaching a stalemate, the American and British governments quietly dropped the matter.

==War of 1812==

The United States declared war against Britain on 18 June 1812. Three days later, within an hour of receiving official word of the declaration, Commodore Rodgers sailed from New York City. The commodore sailed aboard &quot;President&quot;, leading a squadron consisting of &quot;United States&quot;, &quot;Congress&quot;, , and on a 70-day North Atlantic cruise. A passing American merchant ship informed Rodgers about a fleet of British merchantmen en route to Britain from Jamaica. Rodgers and his squadron sailed in pursuit, and on 23 June they encountered what was later learned to be . &quot;President&quot; pursued the ship, and in what is recorded as the first shot of the War of 1812, Rodgers himself aimed and fired a bowchaser at &quot;Belvidera&quot;, striking her rudder and penetrating the gun room. Upon &quot;President&quot;″s fourth shot at &quot;Belvidera&quot;, a cannon one deck below Rodgers burst, killing or wounding 16 sailors and throwing Rodgers to the deck with enough force to break his leg.

The ensuing confusion allowed &quot;Belvidera&quot; to fire her stern chasers, killing six more men aboard &quot;President&quot;. Rodgers kept up the pursuit, using his bow chasers to severely damage &quot;Belvidera&quot;″s rigging, but his two broadsides had little effect. The crew of &quot;Belvidera&quot; quickly made repairs to the rigging. They cut loose her anchors and boats and pumped drinking water overboard to lighten her load, thereby increasing her speed. &quot;Belvidera&quot; soon gained enough speed to distance herself from &quot;President&quot;, and Rodgers abandoned the pursuit. &quot;Belvidera&quot; sailed to Halifax to deliver the news that war had been declared.

&quot;President&quot; and her squadron returned to the pursuit of the Jamaican fleet, and on 1 July began to follow the trail of coconut shells and orange peels the Jamaicans had left behind them. &quot;President&quot; sailed to within one day&#x27;s journey of the English Channel, but never sighted the convoy. Rodgers called off the pursuit on 13 July. During their return trip to Boston, Rodgers&#x27; squadron captured seven merchant ships and recaptured one American vessel.

After some refitting, &quot;President&quot;, still under Rodgers&#x27; command, sailed on 8 October with &quot;Congress&quot;, &quot;United States&quot;, and &quot;Argus&quot;. On 12 October, &quot;United States&quot; and &quot;Argus&quot; parted from the squadron for their own patrols. On 10 October, &quot;President&quot; chased , but failed to overtake her. On 17 October &quot;President&quot; captured the British packet ship &quot;Swallow&quot;, which carried a large amount of currency on board. On 31 October, &quot;President&quot; and &quot;Congress&quot; began pursuit of , which was escorting two merchant ships. The chase lasted about three hours, and in that time &quot;Congress&quot; captured the merchant ship &quot;Argo&quot;. Meanwhile, &quot;President&quot; kept after &quot;Galatea&quot; and drew very close, but lost sight of her in the night. &quot;Congress&quot; and &quot;President&quot; remained together, but did not find any ships to capture during November. Returning to the United States, they passed north of Bermuda and proceeded toward the Virginia capes; they arrived in Boston on 31 December, having taken nine prizes. &quot;President&quot; and &quot;Congress&quot; found themselves blockaded there by the Royal Navy until April 1813.
On 30 April, &quot;President&quot; and &quot;Congress&quot; sailed through the blockade on their third cruise of the war. On 2 May, they pursued , but she outran them and escaped. &quot;President&quot; parted company with &quot;Congress&quot; on 8 May, and Rodgers set a course along the Gulf Stream to search for merchant ships to capture. By June, not having come across a single ship, &quot;President&quot; turned north; she put into North Bergen, Norway, on 27 June to replenish her drinking water. Sailing soon after, &quot;President&quot; captured two British merchant ships, which helped to replenish her stores. On 10 June &quot;President&quot; captured the outward-bound Falmouth packet &quot;Duke of Montrose&quot;, Captain Aaron Groub Blewett, which managed to throw her mails overboard before &quot;President&quot; could send a prize crew aboard. &quot;President&quot; made a cartel of &quot;Duke of Montrose&quot;, putting all of &quot;President&quot;″s prisoners on board and then sending her into Falmouth under the command of an American officer. When &quot;Duke of Montrose&quot; arrived at Falmouth the British Government abrogated the cartel on the grounds that they had advised the American Government that the British would not recognize agreements entered into on the high seas.

Around the same time, two Royal Navy ships came into view. &quot;President&quot; set all sails to escape, and outran them in a chase lasting 80 hours. Rodgers reported that his decision to flee the ships was based on identifying them as a ship of the line and a frigate. Royal Navy records later revealed that the vessels were actually the 32-gun frigate and the 16-gun fireship .

Spending a few days near the Irish Channel, &quot;President&quot; captured several more merchant ships. She then set a course for the United States. In late September, she encountered along the east coast of the United States. Rodgers used his signal flags to trick &quot;Highflyer&quot; into believing that &quot;President&quot; was . Lieut. George Hutchinson, &quot;Highflyer&quot;″s captain, came aboard &quot;President&quot; only to discover he had walked into a trap; &quot;President&quot; captured &quot;Highflyer&quot; without a shot being fired. &quot;President&quot;″s long cruise netted her 11 merchant ships, in addition to &quot;Highflyer&quot;.

On 4 December 1813, &quot;President&quot; sailed from Providence, Rhode Island. On the 25th, she encountered two frigates in the dark, one of which fired at her. Rodgers believed the ships to be British, but they were two French frigates, and . Afterward, Rodgers headed toward Barbados for an eight-week cruise in the West Indies, reportedly making three small captures, among them the British merchant ships &quot;Wanderer&quot;, which she captured on 4 January 1814 in the Atlantic Ocean at approximately and sank, and &quot;Edward&quot;, which she captured and sank on 9 January. Returning to New York City on 18 February 1814, &quot;President&quot; encountered HMS &quot;Loire&quot;, which turned to escape once the latter&#x27;s crew realized &quot;President&quot; was a 44-gun frigate. &quot;President&quot; remained in New York for the duration of 1814 due to the harbor&#x27;s blockade by a British squadron consisting of , , &quot;Pomone&quot;, and &quot;Tenedos&quot;.

===Capture===

Stephen Decatur assumed command of &quot;President&quot; in December 1814, planning a cruise to the West Indies to prey on British shipping. In mid-January 1815, a snowy gale with strong winds forced the British blockading squadron away from New York Harbor, giving Decatur the opportunity to put to sea. On the evening of 14 January, &quot;President&quot; headed out of the harbor but ran aground, the result of harbor pilots incorrectly marking a safe passage. Stranded on the sand bar, &quot;President&quot; lifted and dropped with the incoming tide. Within two hours her hull had been damaged, her timbers twisted, and masts sprung. Damage to her keel caused the ship to hog and sag. Decatur was finally able to float &quot;President&quot; off the bar and, assessing the damage, he decided to return to New York for repairs; however, the wind direction was not favorable and &quot;President&quot; was forced to head out to sea.

Unaware of the exact location of the blockading squadron, Decatur set a course to avoid them and seek a safe port, but approximately two hours later the squadron&#x27;s sails were spotted on the horizon. &quot;President&quot; changed course to outrun them, but the damage she suffered the night before had significantly reduced her speed. Attempting to gain speed, Decatur ordered expendable cargo thrown overboard; by late afternoon of 15 January, HMS &quot;Endymion&quot; under Captain Henry Hope came alongside and proceeded to fire broadsides. Decatur planned to bring &quot;President&quot; in close to &quot;Endymion&quot;, whereby &quot;President&quot;″s crew could board and capture the opposing ship and sail her to New York. (&quot;President&quot; would be scuttled to prevent her capture).

Making several attempts to close on &quot;Endymion&quot;, Decatur discovered that &quot;President&quot;″s damage limited her maneuverability, allowing &quot;Endymion&quot; to anticipate, and draw away from, positions favorable for boarding. Faced with this new dilemma, Decatur ordered bar and chain shot fired to disable &quot;Endymion&quot;″s sails and rigging, the idea being to shake his pursuer and allow &quot;President&quot; to proceed to a safe port without being followed. At noon, &quot;Endymion&quot;, being the much better sailer, was close-hauled, outpacing her squadron and leaving them behind. At 2 pm, she gained on &quot;President&quot; and took position on the American ship&#x27;s quarter, shooting into &quot;President&quot; as she tried to escape. &quot;Endymion&quot; was able to rake &quot;President&quot; three times and did considerable damage to her; by contrast, &quot;President&quot; primarily directed her fire at &quot;Endymion&#x27;s&quot; rigging in order to slow her down during the two-hour engagement.

Finally at 7:58 pm, &quot;President&quot; ceased fire and hoisted a light in her rigging, indicating that she had surrendered. &quot;Endymion&quot; ceased firing on the defeated American ship but did not board to take possession of her prize, due to a lack of undamaged boats. &quot;Endymion&quot;″s foresails had been damaged in the engagement and while she hove to for repairs, Decatur took advantage of the situation and, despite having struck, made off to escape at 8:30 pm; &quot;Endymion&quot;, hastily completed repairs and resumed the chase at 8:52 pm.

&quot;President&quot; drew away while her crew made hurried repairs of their own. Within two hours, one of her lookouts spotted the remainder of the enemy squadron drawing near. &quot;President&quot; continued her escape attempt, but by nightfall HMS &quot;Pomone&quot; and &quot;Tenedos&quot; had caught up and began firing broadsides. Realizing his situation, Decatur surrendered &quot;President&quot; again, just before midnight.

==As HMS &quot;President&quot;==
Now in possession of the Royal Navy, &quot;President&quot; and her crew were ordered to proceed to Bermuda with &quot;Endymion&quot;. During the journey, they encountered a dangerous gale. The storm destroyed &quot;President&quot;″s masts and strained her timbers so badly that all the upper-deck guns were thrown overboard to prevent her from sinking. 
The cartel , Garness, master, brought 400 prisoners from &quot;President&quot; from Bermuda back to New York. On 7 April 1815 &quot;Clarendon&quot; grounded at Sandy Hook but crew, passengers, and prisoners were all saved.

Upon the prisoners&#x27; return to the United States, a U.S. Navy court martial board acquitted Decatur, his officers, and his men of any wrongdoing in the surrender of &quot;President&quot;.

&quot;President&quot; and &quot;Endymion&quot; continued to England, arriving at Spithead on 28 March. &quot;President&quot; was commissioned into the Royal Navy under the name HMS &quot;President&quot;. Her initial rating was set at 50 guns, although she was at this stage armed with 60 cannons—thirty 24-pounders (10.9 kg) on the upper deck, twenty-eight 42-pounder (19 kg) carronades on the spar deck, plus two more 24-pounder guns on the forecastle. In February 1817 she was again re-rated, this time to 60 guns.

In March 1818 she was considered for refitting. A drydock inspection revealed that the majority of her timber was defective or rotten and she was broken up at Portsmouth in June. &quot;President&quot;″s design was copied and used to build in 1829, although this was reportedly more of a political maneuver than a testament to the design: the Royal Navy wished to retain the name and likeness of the American ship on their register as a reminder to the United States and other nations of the capture.

<doc id="484796" wikidata="Q5255750" url="?curid=484796" title="1992 Democratic Party presidential primaries">
<text>From February 10 to June 9, 1992, voters of the Democratic Party chose its nominee for president in the 1992 United States presidential election. Despite scandals and questions about his character, Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton won the nomination through a series of primary elections and caucuses culminating in the 1992 Democratic National Convention held from July 13 to July 16, 1992, in New York City. Clinton and Tennessee Senator Al Gore were nominated by the convention for president and vice president, respectively.

Clinton and Gore went on to take advantage of the chaos and disarray of the Reagan coalition and win the presidential election, defeating incumbent President George H. W. Bush and becoming the first Democratic nominee since Jimmy Carter to win a presidential election.

==Background==
Although the McGovern–Fraser Commission had recommended proportionality as early as 1972, this primary was the first to adopt the proportional 15% rule, still in place today, as the standard throughout the country. Any candidate receiving greater than 15% of the vote in a given congressional district (or in the case of New Jersey, state legislative district) would receive a proportional share of the apportioned delegates for that district or state. For 1992 two-thirds of the delegates were selected in 35 primaries.

==Candidates==
During the aftermath of the Gulf War, President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s approval ratings were high. At one point after the successful performance by U.S. forces in Kuwait, President Bush had an 89% approval rating.

As a result of Bush&#x27;s high popularity, major high-profile Democratic candidates feared a high likelihood of defeat in the 1992 general election. This fear was &quot;captured perfectly by &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in a skit called &#x27;Campaign &#x27;92: The Race to Avoid Being the Guy Who Loses to Bush,&#x27;&quot; in which each prospective major candidate &quot;tried to top the other in explaining why they were unfit to run&quot; for the presidency.

Mario Cuomo and Jesse Jackson declined to seek the Democratic nomination for president, as did U.S. Senator and eventual Vice President Al Gore, whose son had been struck by a car and was undergoing extensive surgery and physical therapy. However, Governors Bill Clinton and Jerry Brown and U.S. Senator Paul Tsongas opted to run for president.

==Timeline==
Bush&#x27;s high approval rating after the Gulf War made many Democrats feel that they could not defeat him in the election. Dick Gephardt, Al Gore, Jesse Jackson, Sam Nunn, and Jay Rockefeller did not enter the race despite speculation around them as candidates.

Clinton, a Southerner with experience governing a more conservative state, positioned himself as a centrist New Democrat. He prepared for a run in 1992 amidst a crowded field seeking to beat the incumbent President George H. W. Bush. In the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War, Bush seemed unbeatable, but an economic recession—which ultimately proved to be small by historical standards—spurred the Democrats on. Tom Harkin won his native Iowa without much surprise. Clinton, meanwhile, was still a relatively unknown national candidate before the primary season when a woman named Gennifer Flowers appeared in the press to reveal allegations of an affair. Clinton sought damage control by appearing on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; with his wife, Hillary Clinton, for an interview with Steve Kroft. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts won the primary in neighboring New Hampshire but Clinton&#x27;s second-place finish – strengthened by Clinton&#x27;s speech labeling himself &quot;The Comeback Kid&quot; – re-energized his campaign. Clinton swept nearly all of the Southern Super Tuesday primaries, making him the solid front runner. Jerry Brown, however, began to run a surprising insurgent campaign, particularly through use of a 1-800 number to receive grassroots funding. Brown &quot;seemed to be the most left-wing and right-wing man in the field. [He] called for term limits, a flat tax, and the abolition of the Department of Education.&quot; Brown scored surprising wins in Connecticut and Colorado.

On March 17, Tsongas left the race when he decisively lost both the Illinois and Michigan primaries to Clinton, with Brown as a distant third. Exactly one week later, Brown eked out a narrow win in the bitterly fought Connecticut primary. As the press focused on the primaries in New York and Wisconsin, which were both to be held on the same day, Brown, who had taken the lead in polls in both states, made a serious gaffe: he announced to an audience of various leaders of New York City&#x27;s Jewish community that, if nominated, he would consider the Reverend Jesse Jackson as a vice presidential candidate. Jackson was still a controversial figure in that community and Brown&#x27;s polling numbers suffered. On April 7, he lost narrowly to Clinton in Wisconsin (37–34), and dramatically in New York (41–26). In addition, his &quot;willingness to break with liberal orthodoxy on taxes led to denunciations from the party regulars, but by the end of the race he had been embraced by much of the Left.&quot;

Although Brown continued to campaign in a number of states, he won no further primaries. Despite this, he still had a sizable number of delegates, and a big win in his home state of California would have deprived Clinton of sufficient support to win the nomination. After nearly a month of intense campaigning and multiple debates between the two candidates, Clinton managed to defeat Brown in the California primary by a margin of 47% to 40%. Clinton became the second candidate after George McGovern in 1972 to win the nomination without winning Iowa or New Hampshire. The same feat would be repeated nearly 30 years later by Joe Biden in 2020.

Clinton won 28 of the 35 states that held primaries while only winning 4 of the 16 states that used caucuses. 70% of black voters supported Clinton, 15% supported Brown, and 8% supported Tsongas.

==The convention==
The convention met in New York City, and the official tally was:

* Bill Clinton 3,372
* Jerry Brown 596
* Paul Tsongas 209
* Penn. Gov. Robert P. Casey 10
* Rep. Pat Schroeder 8
* Larry Agran 3
* Ron Daniels 1
* Al Gore 1
* Joe Simonetta 1

Clinton chose U.S. Senator Albert A. Gore Jr. (D-Tennessee) to be his running mate on July 9, 1992. Choosing Gore, who is from Clinton&#x27;s neighboring state of Tennessee, went against the popular strategy of balancing a Southern candidate with a Northern partner. Gore did serve to balance the ticket in other ways, as he was perceived as strong on foreign policy and environmental issues, while Clinton was not. Also, Gore&#x27;s similarities to Clinton allowed him to push some of his key campaign themes, such as centrism and generational change.

Before Gore&#x27;s selection, other politicians were mentioned as a possible running-mate, &quot;e.g.&quot; Bob Kerrey, Dick Gephardt, Mario Cuomo, Indiana Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Pennsylvania Senator Harris Wofford, Florida Senator Bob Graham, and Massachusetts Senator John Kerry.

The Democratic Convention in New York City was essentially a solidification of the party around Clinton and Gore, though there was controversy over whether Jerry Brown, who did not endorse Clinton, would be allowed to speak. Brown did speak at the convention by seconding his own nomination.

Another additional controversy concerned Pennsylvania Governor Bob Casey, who sought a speaking slot at the convention but was not granted one. Casey complained that it was because of his outspoken anti-abortion views: he had warned the platform committee that Democrats were committing political suicide because of their support for abortion rights. Clinton supporters have said that Casey was not allowed to speak because he had not endorsed the ticket.
