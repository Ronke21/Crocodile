<text>Guy Gardner, one of the characters known as [[Green Lantern]], is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, usually in association with the Green Lantern Corps, of which he is a member. Gardner has also been a member of various incarnations of the Justice League.

Gardner has been substantially adapted into media outside comics, primarily in association with the Green Lanterns. James Arnold Taylor, Diedrich Bader, and Troy Baker have voiced the character in animation. Matthew Settle portrayed the character in the television pilot &quot;Justice League of America&quot;. Nathan Fillion will portray Gardner in the DC Universe, beginning with &quot;Superman&quot; (2025).

==Publication history==
Guy Gardner was created by John Broome and Gil Kane in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (vol. 2) #59 (March 1968), although the character was changed significantly in the 1980s by Steve Englehart and Joe Staton who turned him into a jingoistic parody of an ultra-macho &quot;red-blooded American male.&quot; This latter remains the character&#x27;s archetype to this date. Englehart recounted: 

Staton&#x27;s design for Guy Gardner was based on the character Major Ronald Merrick from the TV series &quot;The Jewel in the Crown&quot;, as Staton saw Merrick&#x27;s entitlement and resentment as a parallel to Guy Gardner. Gardner&#x27;s later blue costume, introduced in the first issue of the character&#x27;s first ongoing series (cover dated October 1992), was also designed by Staton. During this series, retitled &quot;Guy Gardner: Warrior&quot; with issue #17, Guy Gardner is gradually evolved into a more vulnerable and heroic character; Beau Smith, who wrote the series for most of its run, was concerned that leaving him as an angry jerk would make the character stagnant and one-note.

==Fictional character biography==
=== Early Life === 
Guy Gardner is raised in Baltimore by his parents, Roland and Peggy Gardner. His father, Roland, is an abusive alcoholic who subjects Guy to daily physical and emotional abuse. While some of Guy&#x27;s injuries are visible, such as bruises and cuts, others are psychological and deeply impactful. Despite striving to excel in school to earn his father&#x27;s approval, Roland favors Guy&#x27;s older brother, Mace. Guy finds solace in reading &quot;General Glory&quot; comic books, even modeling his bowl haircut after Glory&#x27;s sidekick, Ernie. 

During his teenage years, Guy becomes a juvenile delinquent, frequently defying authority. He is eventually set on a better path by Mace, who has become a police officer. Guy later attends the University of Michigan, where he supports himself and earns bachelor&#x27;s degrees in education and psychology. While there, he plays football until a career-ending injury derails his athletic aspirations, leaving a lasting emotional impact. 

After college, Guy works as a social welfare caseworker, focusing on prison inmate rehabilitation. However, he abandons this career, fearing it amplifies his aggressive tendencies. He then transitions to teaching children with disabilities, finding a more suitable and fulfilling role. 

In &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity, Guy&#x27;s backstory is significantly altered. He is portrayed as a former police officer and the middle child in a family with a long tradition in the Baltimore Police Department, dating back to 1860. He earns his Green Lantern ring after heroically rescuing his older brother, Gerard, during a police shootout. In this version, Guy has a strained relationship with his father, Ebenezer, a decorated officer forced into early retirement due to injuries sustained in the line of duty. Guy&#x27;s dismissal from the police force stems from an unexplained incident. 

This origin is later retconned in DC Rebirth, which reintroduces Guy&#x27;s abusive upbringing at the hands of his alcoholic father, Roland Gardner. This is revisited during Guy&#x27;s present-day fight with the Sinestro Corps member Arkillo and further confirmed when his father is reintroduced under his original name.

===Green Lantern Corps===
The Green Lantern of Space Sector 2814, an alien named Abin Sur from the planet Ungara, crash-lands on Earth after being mortally wounded. As Sur dies, his power ring seeks and finds two potential successors: Guy Gardner and Hal Jordan. Jordan is nearer to the crash, so he is chosen over Gardner. As a result, Guy is relegated to being a backup should anything happen to Jordan.

When Jordan becomes aware of Gardner&#x27;s status as his backup, he sets up a chance meeting, and the two become friends. Though Gardner is originally naive to Jordan&#x27;s secret identity, he eventually assists Jordan during his adventures. He is later partnered with Jordan after training under Kilowog.

During an earthquake, Gardner is hit by a bus while attempting to rescue one of his students. During his recovery, the Guardians recruit John Stewart to be Jordan&#x27;s new &quot;backup&quot;.

Some time later, during a period where Gardner is performing his duties as a backup Green Lantern, Hal Jordan&#x27;s power battery explodes, trapping him in the Phantom Zone. Jordan and Kari Limbo, Gardner&#x27;s girlfriend at the time, both believe him to be dead, and the two develop a romantic relationship that ultimately culminates in a marriage proposal. Gardner interrupts the wedding by contacting Limbo telepathically. His previous experiences affect his mind, causing him to sustain brain damage and be rendered comatose for several years. He recovers, but his personality is radically altered, causing him to become arrogant and unstable.

Following &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, the Guardians and the Zamarons leave the universe to create the next generation of Guardians. Gardner is placed under the care of Appa Ali Apsa on the planet Maltus before escaping. Apsa recaptures Gardner before Jordan bargains with him to let Gardner go.

===Justice League International===
Soon after obtaining his freedom from Maltus, Gardner becomes a founding member of the Justice League International after the original JLA disbands in the 1986-87 storyline &quot;Legends&quot;. In his time with the JLI, Gardner resents Batman&#x27;s leadership of the group, going so far as to challenge the Dark Knight to a fist fight. In a notorious panel, Batman downs Guy with one punch after Guy takes off his ring. The other members leave him lying on the floor. When Guy wakes up, he bangs his head on a console and knocks himself out. When he comes to, his personality has changed to kind and gentle. Until he hits his head again at a later point, Guy is kind, sweet, boyishly innocent, and a perfect gentleman to the female members of the group. Guy&#x27;s run in JLI is full of constant personality shifts and endless arguing between team members. This leads to a fight with Lobo, the sucker-punching of Blue Beetle during a boxing match, and finally him quitting the team after being &quot;belittled&quot; by Superman.

Gardner is romantically involved with his fellow Leaguer Ice, even learning some rudimentary Norwegian, but he is often callous to her and slow to admit his feelings. Their relationship ends with her death at the hands of the Overmaster.

The relationship with Ice is revisited in the 2021-2023 DC Black Label series &quot;The Human Target&quot;. Gardner is depicted as an obsessive stalker, enraged by Ice&#x27;s romance with Christopher Chance, who is dying from a poison meant for Lex Luthor. In issue 6 of the series, in what has been described as &quot;the of the most startling things your reviewer has ever witnessed in a superhero comic&quot;, Ice freezes Gardner and Chance smashes Gardner&#x27;s frozen body into chunks. The series&#x27; final issues reveal that Gardner faked his death at Ice&#x27;s request as part of a plot to cover up the true nature of Chance&#x27;s poisoning.

===Guy Gardner: Reborn===

After completing his assignment of recruiting new Corps members, Jordan returns to Earth to reclaim his title as Green Lantern of Sector 2814. Gardner&#x27;s response is to challenge Jordan to a fight where the loser would quit the Corps. Gardner loses and surrenders his ring. After some failed run-ins with Goldface and Black Hand as a non-powered vigilante, he sets out on a quest to regain his power and identity. Tricking Lobo into assisting him, he invades Qward to find the yellow power ring of Sinestro, but is told by the Qwardians that the ring is unique and never returned to Qward. He then travels to Oa and finds it on Sinestro&#x27;s hand in the &quot;Crypt of the Green Lantern Corps&quot;.

Gardner&#x27;s own comic series begins with him using the yellow ring and a modified costume similar to his Green Lantern costume but from street clothes. The yellow ring does not use a battery to recharge. It needs to be used against the rings of Green Lanterns so it can absorb their residual energy to restore its power. Gardner discovers this by accident when Kilowog uses his own ring to scan Gardner&#x27;s.

Guy Gardner returns to Earth to pick a fight with Superman but eventually rejoins the Justice League and helps battle the monster Doomsday. Guy and his teammates are brutally beaten, and Superman is killed during the creature&#x27;s defeat. During the &quot;Reign of the Supermen&quot; storyline, when four different versions of Superman appear after his death, Guy fights, becomes allies with and later endorses the Last Son of Krypton Superman, who is actually the Eradicator. Later, Guy clears his name of murder that is committed by his Draalian clone &quot;Joe Gardner&quot; and learns that his brother Mace has become the assassin Militia. After a brawl between the two, Guy decides to take the codename Warrior.

In the &quot;JLA: Classified&quot;-based miniseries &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not the Justice League&quot;, Guy assists the Super Buddies and is revealed to have kept his yellow ring.

===&quot;Guy Gardner: Warrior&quot;===
By this time, the power of Guy&#x27;s ring begins to fluctuate due to the meddling of the villain Parallax (Hal Jordan). Deprived of his powers, Guy wears a golden exosuit provided by Blue Beetle which simulates superhuman strength. Guy is not happy with this initial suit as it does not feel as natural as using a ring power. The exosuit first appears in issue 18, the second issue to feature the new title of &quot;Guy Gardner: Warrior&quot;. Although the exosuit is destroyed during combat with Militia in issue 19, Guy&#x27;s power ring provides him with a new exosuit constructed of ring energy. This is much more to Guy&#x27;s liking.

After the destruction of his hometown, a grief-stricken and power-hungry Hal Jordan destroys the Green Lantern Corps. Ganthet first comes to Guy Gardner to offer him the last Green Lantern power ring. When Gardner refuses, Ganthet decides to entrust it to Kyle Rayner.

After Guy starts having visions of Oa&#x27;s destruction and his power starts to mysteriously increase, he leads a group of heroes to Oa to find out what happened to the Corps. Guy and his team are ambushed and quickly defeated by Parallax. Guy manages to trick Hal into thinking that he is dead by simulating a ring powered construct of himself that was impaled by an energy pike. Guy uses the element of surprise and manages to evenly match Hal in a fight for a few minutes. Eventually Hal gains the upper hand, defeats Gardner and destroys his ring. Parallax then punches out one of Gardner&#x27;s eyes and sends him and his team back to Earth. Guy awakes in the hospital after spending three weeks in a coma. Deprived again of his power ring, he is forced to find an alternate means of acquiring power.
Guy joins up with the Doc Savage analogue Buck Wargo and his globe-trotting Monster Hunters, which features obscure Silver Age hero Tiger-Man (Desmond Farr) along with Joey Hong and Rita Muldoon. On an expedition to the Amazon, Gardner finds and drinks from the chalice of the Warrior Water. This activates alien DNA that was implanted in his bloodline a millennium ago by the Vuldarians, a space-traveling race. He discovers new, shapeshifting abilities that writer Beau Smith claims were editorially mandated to capitalize on the success of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, and which would allow him to resume his role as a superhero. When Guy first emerges, his body assumes the shape of his old exosuit, albeit red instead of gold, and his lost eye is restored. Guy&#x27;s body remains that way until the end of the &quot;Zero Hour&quot; storyline. He morphs weapons directly out of his arms as of &quot;Zero Hour&quot; issue #2.

Gardner opens a superhero theme bar called Warriors, as both a source of income and a base between his adventures. He is joined by Buck&#x27;s group, Veronna, mightiest of the Nabba Jungle tribe of women, who guards the Warrior Water and believes she is destined as Guy&#x27;s mate, and those who are brought on as bouncers for Warriors but act as fellow adventurers: Lady Blackhawk (displaced in time by &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot;), Wildcat, Lead, and Arisia Rrab.

His early days as Warrior see him struggling with his newfound powers. He has difficulty changing his body into any weapon, and his transformations often cause him pain. After a breakdown that leads to a confrontation with Superman and Supergirl, with some soul-searching help from his supposed ancestor Cardone, Gardner is finally able to use his new powers to form most non-energy-based weapons from his body, as well as absorb some forms of energy and redirect them through his various &quot;weapons&quot;. Another ability, his capability to use the knowledge of warriors from across space and time, is rarely used and mostly forgotten. Guy has many enemies during the series including Evil Star, Gorilla Grodd, Black Serpent, Sledge, Major Force, Martika the Seductress, Bronkk and the Tormocks (ancient nemeses to the Vuldarians), Mudakka, and Dementor as well as the return of his clone Joe Gardner (now going by the name Enforcer), the Quorum, and his brother Militia with girlfriend Honey. He teams with many heroes including Steel, with whom he becomes close friends. Gardner also becomes good friends with Lobo after the defeat of the Tormocks.

During the time that Gardner fights against Dementor, he learns that his enemy is also a product of Vuldarian breeding. Dementor&#x27;s father raped a Vuldarian woman. Dementor is sent to Hell, where he reveals that he is the one responsible for Gardner&#x27;s constant personality shifts (in a sense, explaining why his personality changed drastically over the years). However, this new direction only lasts for 30 issues of &quot;Guy Gardner: Warrior&quot; (which crosses over in the Way of the Warrior with &quot;Justice League America&quot; and &quot;Hawkman&quot; and later a crossover with Kyle Rayner&#x27;s Green Lantern book) In the last issues, Gardner finally deals with his &quot;family&quot;, as well as revealing another side of his Vuldarian powers, the ability to heal mortal wounds.

Over the course of the series, Gardner makes peace with a great deal of his past. On one Christmas, the Spectre, on behalf of the Phantom Stranger, makes it possible for Guy to communicate with his deceased father, who apologizes for the abuse, both physical and mental, he placed upon Guy, his brother Mace, and their mother. He reveals how proud he is of all the accomplishments Guy achieved as a man and the pair reconcile. Afterward, Guy gives his condolences to Ice&#x27;s mother over their shared loss of her daughter and she provides him an ice sculpture to remind him of her daughter. A celebration held at Warriors for the holiday sees Guy cross paths with an inebriated Fire. The pair shares a kiss after expressing how much they miss Ice. It is suggested they sleep together after this.

After the &quot;Warrior&quot; series is canceled, Gardner continues to appear in the DC Universe; most notably as a recurring character in the &quot;Green Lantern&quot; series during Kyle Rayner&#x27;s run and a reserve member of the JLA. He seems to be killed during the &quot;Our Worlds at War&quot; crossover. He is later discovered to be trapped in a pocket of Hell called the Gorge in General Zod&#x27;s country of Pokolistan. After freeing himself by switching places with Superman villain Kancer as ruler of the Gorge, his Warrior powers are apparently enhanced. He declares it his job to do less ethical things that heroes like Superman cannot.

===Return to the Corps===
During the 2005 miniseries &quot;Green Lantern: Rebirth&quot;, Gardner&#x27;s Vuldarian DNA is overwritten by his human DNA when Parallax possesses Gardner and several Green Lanterns. Hal Jordan&#x27;s ring splits in two and Gardner&#x27;s ring is restored to him. Eventually, Parallax is defeated by the combined effort of all five active Green Lanterns, including Gardner. The Guardians then select Gardner as one of the senior officers of the new Green Lantern Corps.

In the 2005–2006 miniseries &quot;Green Lantern Corps: Recharge&quot; (written by Dave Gibbons), the Guardians assign Gardner to be one of the Corps&#x27; three main instructors, along with Kilowog and Kyle Rayner. The trio is responsible for the training of the new Corps, to which the Guardians intend to name 7,200 members. Gardner is not at all appreciative of his new role. When he complains to the Guardians, they tell him that success in training new recruits could lead to him being given a new position.

Gardner plays a significant role in defeating the Spider Guild attack on Oa. Discovering that trainee Soranik Natu has disappeared into the forbidden Vega star system, which the Guardians&#x27; pact with the Psions forbids Green Lanterns from entering, Gardner and Kyle Rayner led a rescue mission in direct violation of Oan policy. Once there, the Lanterns discover the Spider Guild nest and determine that its next target is the Oan sun. Returning just as the attack commences, Gardner gathers the frightened trainee Green Lanterns and rallies them with a speech that impresses even his longtime rival, Hal Jordan. Gardner&#x27;s performance in repelling the attack results in his promotion to Lantern #1 of the Green Lantern Honor Guard, a position of authority over other Lanterns. In this new role, Gardner is expected to &quot;think outside the box&quot; and &quot;do the jobs other Lanterns cannot&quot;, a function well-suited to his irascible personality.

===&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; and &quot;One Year Later&quot;===
In his new role as Lantern #1, Guy leads the Corps in the defense of Oa against Superboy-Prime, creating a wall of energy to slow the rampaging teen and calling a &quot;Code 54&quot;, authorizing the use of extreme force. Guy supervises the final capture and imprisonment of Superboy-Prime, locking him in a red Sun-Eater provided by Donna Troy and organizing a constant watch of fifty Lanterns to keep him imprisoned.

Guy spends the entire &quot;missing year&quot; following &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; doing missions for the Guardians without shore leave (though he is infrequently seen on Earth in the &quot;52&quot; weekly limited series, it should be assumed he has sneaked away from the Guardians&#x27; watch). When he is finally granted some time off one year later, his relaxation is cut short by an attack by a grudge-holding Bolphunga the Relentless. Soon after, Guy assisted Hal Jordan on an unsanctioned mission to the Manhunter homeworld, Biot. Through Hal and Guy&#x27;s efforts, several long-lost and believed deceased lanterns (including Arisia, Chaselon, Jack T. Chance, Graf Toren, Hannu, Ke&#x27;Haan, Laira, and Boodikka) were freed from imprisonment by the Cyborg Superman. Upon returning from the mission, Guy was punished by the Guardians and forced to endure one month as one of the fifty Lanterns on &quot;Prime Duty&quot;. Lanterns of the Honor Guard, like Guy, are allowed to break the rules three times before expulsion.

According to &quot;Green Lantern&quot; writer Geoff Johns in a 2006 Newsarama interview, Prime would not be escaping under Guy&#x27;s watch: &quot;Not at all. That&#x27;s ridiculous. Anyone who&#x27;s read Guy Gardner for the last two years in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; or in &quot;Green Lantern Corps&quot; knows that he&#x27;s a much better, stronger character than that. And even in the old Giffen stuff, he would probably break some rules, taunt the other heroes, and drink a beer or two, but he would not be that much of an idiot. He was never that much of an idiot, and certainly not with what I&#x27;m doing with him, or with what Dave Gibbons is doing with him in &quot;Corps&quot;. He has his moments, and he&#x27;s a really fun character, but he&#x27;s definitely not going to be a moron. His role is not DCU Moron. His role is DCU Shitkicker&quot;.

===The Corpse===
Guy is briefly part of the Corps&#x27; Black Ops division. Dubbed &quot;The Corpse&quot;, members forsake their rings for stealthier powers provided by the Guardians. Guy takes part in one mission with this secretive unit. He is tasked with locating Von Daggle, a Durlan who was formerly in charge of the Corpse. Gardner relays a message from the Guardians, informing Daggle that he was reinstated. From there, Daggle takes command of Gardner, leading him to the homeworld of the Dominators, a race of superscientists with a grudge against Earth. Together, they defeat a super-evolved Dominator, though the Corpse&#x27;s use of lethal force does not sit well with Guy. Gardner informs Daggle that he cannot be a part of his crew and Daggle wipes his memory, musing that &quot;humans never make the cut&quot;.

===&quot;Sinestro Corps War&quot;===
In the &quot;Sinestro Corps War&quot; storyline, Superboy-Prime and Cyborg Superman escape imprisonment when the Sinestro Corps attacks Oa, killing the guards on Prime Duty. Guy, along with fellow Green Lanterns Hal Jordan and John Stewart, are captured by Parallax during battle and brought to Qward. Guy and Stewart are then held prisoner by Lyssa Drak, who forces them to relive tragedies in their lives. Hal manages to defeat Lyssa and free Guy and John from their nightmare. In the skirmish following their escape, Parallax nearly breaks Gardner&#x27;s neck. Upon returning to their universe, they defend Earth from the entire Sinestro Corps. After helping to free Kyle from Parallax&#x27;s possession, Parallax is split into four pieces by former Guardians Ganthet and Sayd, and placed into the power batteries of Hal, John, Guy, and Kyle. Guy is infected by the Sinestro Corps&#x27; deadly alien virus named Despotellis, but cured by the Green Lantern Corps&#x27; own sentient smallpox virus, Leezle Pon.

===Return of Ice===
Within the aftermath of the Sinestro Corps War, Guy is finally reunited with former girlfriend Ice, recently resurrected. Despite Ice&#x27;s uncertainty as to the wisdom of reviving the old romance, Guy&#x27;s professions of adoration seem sufficient to convince her to meet him for a proper date on the same spot exactly one month later. Before leaving Earth to open a bar/restaurant on Oa, Guy leaves Ice a note. She declines his proposal to cohabit on Oa, and Guy reads her desire to rebuild a new life on Earth with her best friend Beatriz as an attempt to distance from him, accusing Beatriz of pitting Ice against him. The two agree that their current situations will make a relationship impossible.

===&quot;Blackest Night&quot;===
In the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; storyline, Guy and Kyle Rayner are opposed to the Guardians&#x27; decision to execute all Sinestro Corps members and all other prisoners and attempt unsuccessfully to convince the Alpha Lanterns and the Guardians themselves to stay away from the dark path on which they are headed, and are reassigned to Earth. They later try to return to Oa, and fail to repel an invasion of a swarm of black rings to Oa&#x27;s Lantern crypt, where the corpses of fallen Lanterns are reanimated as Black Lanterns. In the ensuing conflict, Guy is forced to crush the body of the insectoid Bzzd, but is then impaled through the leg by Ke&#x27;Haan.

After Kyle is killed in the explosion of Chaselon&#x27;s power battery, Guy flies into a rage, and is transformed into a Red Lantern. Now powered by both of his green and red power rings, Guy seeks vengeance against the Black Lanterns and is able to destroy them on sight effortlessly with his combined weapons. Despite Kyle&#x27;s resurrection at the hands of Star Sapphire Miri Riam, Guy turns his murderous rage on his former friends, before Mogo purges the Red Lantern rage from him, though he is told only a Blue Lantern can cure him completely. He then joins the battle against Nekron on Earth.

===&quot;Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors&quot;===
After the events of &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Guy Gardner stars in the monthly series &quot;Emerald Warriors&quot;, written by Peter Tomasi. While searching for a cure for his Red Lantern rage, it is revealed that Guy entered into an alliance with Red Lantern leader Atrocitus. This briefly alienates Guy from Kilowog and Arisia.

In the &quot;War of the Green Lanterns&quot; storyline, the influence of Parallax, now restored to the Central Power Battery, forces Guy and the other Earth Lanterns to use the rings of other Corps. Guy, citing his experience with the Red Lanterns, chooses the red power ring. During their conflict with the Green Lantern Corps, Guy and his allies release Parallax from the Central Power Battery, Guy using the Star Sapphire ring in conjunction with the Red Lantern ring, drawing on his love of the Corps and his hatred and his anger to power both rings at once, the two emotional extremes proving sufficient to release Parallax from the battery. Guy is subsequently cleansed of the Red Lantern energy by Kyle Rayner&#x27;s blue ring before each reclaims his usual ring.

===The New 52===

Gardner, John Stewart, and an elite Green Lantern Strike Team star in a relaunched &quot;Green Lantern Corps&quot; series, which debuted in September 2011 as part of DC&#x27;s The New 52 relaunch. This series debuted with author Peter J. Tomasi and art by Fernando Pasarin and Scott Hanna. Guy is also shown on the cover for the new &quot;Justice League International&quot; series that was released that same month, written by Dan Jurgens and with art by Aaron Lopresti. Initially, Guy appears to be the one Earth Green Lantern that the Guardians still appear to rely on, what with Hal having been expelled after &quot;War of the Green Lanterns&quot;, Kyle being expelled due to his alliance with the other ring-wielders, and John being put on trial for killing another Lantern. However, the Guardians really plan to undermine all four Earth Lanterns by sabotaging Guy&#x27;s career after building it up, ensuring a precipitous fall.

This plan begins when the Guardians promote Guy to the role of &#x27;Sentinel Lantern&#x27; and entrust him with guarding a group of ambassadors travelling to a planet for a crucial conference. They subsequently release Guy&#x27;s old enemy Xar from the Science cells and create the impression that he is going after Guy&#x27;s family on Earth. They predicted that Guy would abandon his duty and return to Earth while Xar attacks the ambassadors. With the rest of his team having been absorbed by the Third Army, Guy escapes only through his strength of will, averting the Third Army&#x27;s attempt to &#x27;recruit&#x27; him. With Xar having killed the ambassadors, the Guardians order Guy to resign from the Corps to redeem the damage he has done.

Feeling depressed after a phone conversation with his family, during which his father dismisses superheroes as overly reliant on their powers, Guy attempts to spend the night fighting crime with only his natural skills. This backfires when he interrupts a police sting operation, culminating in him being arrested by his sister. While in prison, he is attacked by the Third Army, but is rescued by Green Lanterns Simon Baz and B&#x27;dg, who send the civilians to safety before crushing the Third Army and retreating to the Sea of Tranquility on the moon. Guy is angered when he discovers that the Guardians have turned against him and the Corps. Simon and B&#x27;dg dispatch him to the planet Oa. There, Guy reclaims his ring and joins Kilowog and the others reserve Corps members in their rebellion against the treacherous Guardians.

After the villainous First Lantern is destroyed and the unemotional Guardians are killed off by Sinestro, Guy and Kilowog locate where Salaak was imprisoned by the Guardians and free him. Guy is angered when he discovers Salaak&#x27;s surveillance footage of Xar being released by the Guardians. Salaak helps him locate Xar&#x27;s whereabouts, and discovers that Xar is located on Earth and preparing to kill off Guy&#x27;s family. Guy manages to speed up with Saint Walker&#x27;s willing assistance to arrive in time to blast Xar to be incinerated, and reunites with his family.

Following the event, Guy is placed in the cast of the &quot;Red Lanterns&quot; series where he is sent by Hal Jordan to join the Red Lanterns undercover. He defeats Atrocitus and takes command of the group. It is revealed that part of his decision to join with the Red Lanterns is feeling as if he has never fit in as a Green Lantern. As a Red Lantern Gardner manages to keep his rage in check, successfully leading most of the Red Lanterns; Atrocitus leads a splinter group and allows new Red rings to cause murderous justice-based rampages to continue. After joining with the Green Lanterns to defeat the cosmic terrorist Relic, Hal promises to give the Red Lanterns a sector for them to watch over, unwittingly this sector becomes Sector 2814, where Earth resides, giving guardianship of Earth to the Red Lantern Corps.

Guy also tries to reunite with Ice but she has undergone several personal revelations of her own and needs time apart; Guy promises to give her just that.

==Powers and abilities==

===Power rings===

Guy Gardner is trained to use a Green Lantern power ring, which is only limited by the user&#x27;s willpower. He later acquires Sinestro&#x27;s Qwardian power ring, which is later revealed to be based on the bearer&#x27;s control of fear. This early version of a yellow ring is powered by absorbing plasma radiation expelled from a Green Lantern ring. It seems to make Guy more invulnerable than a normal Green Lantern. He uses both for basic Lantern abilities including constructs, flight, and energy projection, though it also causes him some difficulty on occasion. For example, if he asks it a question he will get an answer in Qwardian, which he does not speak. In &quot;Green Lantern: Rebirth&quot; #6 it is mentioned that Guy Gardner&#x27;s ring is constantly sparking with energy, as if unable to contain the power of his will. Following Kyle Rayner&#x27;s apparent death, Guy&#x27;s rage causes a red power ring to latch onto him, bestowing on him the ability to generate napalm like flames that will burn even in space. Unlike most Red Lanterns, Guy retains his intelligence, and, like Hal Jordan when he was under the thrall of a red ring, Guy is able to shape the red flames into solid constructs. Unlike Hal, Guy&#x27;s green ring remains active, allowing him to combine the two lights and obliterate the Black Lanterns. Guy is also the first male character seen to wield a love-powered Star Sapphire ring, wearing it in conjunction with the Red Lantern ring (he states that the result feels like he has blood and sugar in his mouth). During the events of the &quot;Green Lanterns: The Lost Army&quot;, Guy creates a new uniform using both his green and red rings. Later during the final battle, the Power Converters used by Lightsmiths convert Guy&#x27;s Red Lantern Ring to a Green Lantern ring, thus ending his connection to the Red Lantern Corps. Lastly, a Blue Lantern Ring comes to Guy.

===Vuldarian powers===
Guy&#x27;s Vuldarian powers include limited shapeshifting abilities which allow him to create weapons out of his body like blades and energy guns, shielding, armor or equipment which he has total control over. At first, these transformations cause him pain and he is unable to shrink from his 7-foot height. He maintains super strength, stamina, and durability around Superman&#x27;s strata, the power of flight, capable of surviving in outer space unassisted, accelerated healing, and has access to the memories of deceased Vuldarians (touted as the most dangerous warriors in the history of the universe). Trained by the Vuldarian Cardone, Gardner becomes highly skilled in using his abilities and practices extensively in the martial arts. During the return of Parallax, he suffers a metahuman power discharge and his Vuldarian abilities go into recession. Coincidentally, when he awakes, he is near Hal Jordan&#x27;s power ring, which has the ability to duplicate itself. Gardner once more has a power ring, and following the return of the Guardians of the Universe, he is once again a Green Lantern.

===Green Lantern (Tangent Comics)===

Guy becomes the caretaker of a mystical artifact that survives the events of the 2005 &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; storyline, after it is discovered on New Earth by Kyle Rayner. It has the power to temporarily awaken the dead and has also served as a dimensional gateway. The Guardians eventually use the artifact for a ritual to merge the willpower entity Ion with Sodam Yat during the &quot;Sinestro Corps War&quot;.

<text>Moyobamba () or Muyupampa (Quechua &quot;muyu&quot; circle, &quot;pampa&quot; large plain, &quot;circle plain&quot;) is the capital city of the San Martín Region in northern Peru. Called &quot;Santiago of eight valleys of Moyobamba&quot; or &quot;Maynas capital&quot;. There are 50,073 inhabitants, according to the 2017 census. Some 3,500 species of orchids are native to the area, which has led to the city&#x27;s nickname of &quot;The City of Orchids&quot;. The city is the capital of both Moyobamba Province and Moyobamba District.

The city is linked by road with Tarapoto to the southeast, Rioja to the west and Bagua to the northwest. Roads connect Moyobamba to the Pacific coast by way of Bagua and Olmos to the north and Cajamarca to the southwest.

==History==

The first colonies were from the Chachapoyas culture, but the modern city of Moyobamba was established by Juan Pérez de Guevara on 25 July 1540, who named it &quot;Santiago de los Ocho Valles de Moyobamba&quot; (Santiago of the eight Moyobamba Valleys). It was founded on the site of an Inca settlement and was the first city founded by the Spanish in the Peruvian Amazon. It is the second oldest Spanish town east of the Andes.

During the Spanish Conquest, Moyobamba was a base from which incursions were made into the surrounding areas.

The city was the seat of the first religious missions established in the region. The Roman Catholic Church used the city as a base, where it began the task of converting the natives to Christianity. It was an important commercial center during the colonial era (1533–1821) and it was given city status in 1857. The historic &quot;Puerto de Tahuishco&quot; was once a vibrant port along the Mayo River, but has since become one of the last waning vestiges of the river trade route.

On 7 June 1897, Moyobamba was made the capital of the Loreto Region. On 4 September 1906, it became the capital of the San Martín Region. It was named the seat of the Territorial Prelature of Moyobamba in 1948. On September 25, 2005, Moyobamba was affected by the 2005 northern Peru earthquake.

==Geography==

The city sits on a bluff overlooking the Mayo River, at 2,820 feet (860 m) above sea level, in the humid, tropical region known as the &quot;Ceja de selva&quot;.

Native Orchids are the most famous of the Moyobamba flora.

The surrounding area consists of rivers, caves, waterfalls, hot springs and lakes. These include the Tioyacu River and the subterranean river in the cave of the Huacharos (&quot;Cueva de los Huacharos&quot;), the natural hot springs at San Mateo, the Laguna Azul lake, the Ahuashiyacu and the Gera waterfalls.
===Climate===
Moyobamba has a tropical climate of rainy, very warm and humid savanna. The temperature varies between (minimum) and (maximum), being the average temperature throughout the year. On some nights in Moyobamba it is cooler.

==Demographics==
The demographics of Moyobamba is a mix of cultures and people of different origins. The european group includes people from Spain and Italy with smaller groups of people from Armenia, Syria, Germany, and Poland and forms 70 percent of the population; the &quot;mixed people&quot; (amerindian with european) form 25 percent of total population. The remaining 5 percent of the population includes Chinese, Japanese, Quechua and other amerindians (amazonian groups), and people of black origins.

One small group people, descendants of Armenians, Jews, and Germans have the higher education and economic rate in the city; many of their members emigrated from Moyobamba to other areas and are very active in politics, economy, trade and education in largest cities of Peru (like Lima, Trujillo, Arequipa, Ica and Chiclayo).

==Economy==

Moyobamba is the center of a large agricultural region and one of the major trading centers for the Aguaruna Native Communities which inhabit the surrounding valley known as the Upper Mayo River Valley. The most lucrative crops grown in the region include rice, coffee, and corn. Cotton, sugarcane, tobacco and cocoa are also produced.

Alcohol, liquor, wines, and straw hats are produced in the city.

Hot springs, gold, and some petroleum are found nearby.

After the slow demise of its airport, this regional capital began to fall behind the faster-developing Tarapoto, a neighboring city further down-river. Farmers and regional government workers often clash in a geopolitical battle over local control and access to outside markets.

==Festivities==
===Fiesta de San Juan===

&quot;Moyobambinos&quot; (residents of Moyobamba) celebrate the region&#x27;s patron saint (&quot;San Juan&quot; - Saint John) every year on June 24. Locals celebrate with traditional dances and dishes, most notably Juane, a dish that is meant to resemble the head of John the Baptist on a platter before Herod Antipas. It is made by stuffing a ball of sticky green rice with chicken and wrapping it in bijao (&quot;Heliconia bihai&quot;) leaves for cooking. Then celebrants dance the &quot;Pandilla&quot; around wooden poles dug into the ground before chopping them down with an axe and collecting the treasures from the top.

<text>Weapon dances incorporating swords or similar weapons are recorded throughout world history. There are various traditions of solo and mock-battle (Pyrrhic) sword dances in Africa, Asia and Europe. Some traditions use sticks or clubs in place of bladed weapons, while most modern performers employ dulled replications to avoid injury.

==Forms==
General types of sword dance include:
*solo dancers around swords – such as the traditional Scottish sword dances. This general form also encompasses non-sword dances such as the bacca pipes jig in Cotswold morris dance,
*mock-battle dances, including many stick dances from non-sword traditions, and such common continental dances as Bouffons or Mattachins as described by Thoinot Arbeau in 1588.
*hilt-and-point sword dances – where the dancers are linked together by their swords in a chain. These form the basis for rapper sword and long sword forms.

==China and Vietnam==

Sword dances in China and Vietnam, known as &quot;jian wu&quot; or &quot;múa kiếm&quot;, began as a military training exercise with swords and spears which evolved into an elaborate acrobatic dance. Jian wu was one of four classical dances that were used in the Chinese and Vietnamese opera. Each of these dances was very meaningful within the opera performances and they often were used for plot descriptions and characterization. Sword dancing also found a use in Chinese and Vietnamese cultures through communicating with the supernatural; sword dancing was done in an effort to communicate feelings to the dead spirits that may be disrupting a household.

There are quite a few styles within the actual art of sword dancing. The first style focuses on relaxation and flexibility while the other style focuses on speed and strength. There are also different types of swords and weapons used during each dance. A long sword is usually wielded with slower dramatic movements during a solo performance while shorter scimitars are used at a very high pace during a sword dance between two or more people. Each style requires certain movements that require the dancer to be highly agile and athletic.

==Indian subcontinent==

Many sword-dances in the Indian subcontinent originated with the martial traditions of the region, the paragon of which exemplified in the long-established Gatka tradition, arising from the tenet of monolithic, theosophical militarization found within Sikhism. The paika akhada which were previously used to train Orissan warriors now perform weapon dances in the streets during festivals. Other dances like the &quot;mer dandiya&quot; are simply theatrical depictions of battle, while some like the choliya of the Kumaon region were used to ward off evil spirits. Sword dances are still commonly performed for weddings and other occasions in the Indian subcontinent today.

In the Indian subcontinent, the chhau sword dance, Firkal sword dance, Khasi tribal sword dance, Bhotiya tribe sword dance, Lakharu-li sword dance, Khaijama-Phanai sword dance, Gujarat sword dance and the Khattak sword dance are performed on festive occasions.

==Middle East==
Arab sword dances (&quot;raqs al-saïf&quot;) evolved out of sword fighting between men, in both Egypt and Turkey. There was even a time when sword dancing was banned by the sultan during Ottoman rule, as it was believed that dancers, who took swords from soldiers and pretended to &quot;kill&quot; them at the end of the performances, collected the swords to begin a resistance against the army. These swords were never returned. Female sword dancing was not widespread in West Asia. Men in Egypt performed a dance called &quot;el ard&quot;, a martial dance involving upraised swords, but women were not widely known to use swords as props during their dancing in public. However, paintings and engravings by French artist Jean-Léon Gérôme (who visited Egypt in the 18th century) show sword dancers balancing sabers on their heads. The Turkish Kılıç Kalkan dance of Bursa is performed exclusively by men with a sword and shield, and represents the Ottoman conquest of the city. The performers wear early Ottoman battle dress and dance to the sound of clashing swords and shields without music.

==Europe==
Hilt-and-point sword dances are, or were, performed all over Europe. These are particularly concentrated in an area corresponding to the boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire at around 1400–1500, and many of these traditional dances are still performed in England, Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, North Italy, France, Flanders, and the Iberian Peninsula, with a particular concentration in Basque Country, Galicia and Andalusia. Sword dances are also performed by Albanians, both in the Balkans and in Italy. Into the late 1400s Albanian sword dances were imitated by Italian tarantellas.

Sword dances performed by the guilds of Smiths and Cutlers in Nuremberg are recorded from 1350. 16th century records of sword dances survive from all over Germany. Depictions of dances survive from Zürich (1578) and Nuremberg (1600). In Scotland a dance was recorded as being performed in 1285, but this was found in a document from 1440.

An important concentration of traditional sword dances can be found on the Italian side of the western Alps. Main sites are Giaglione, Venaus and S. Giorio in the Susa valley, where the so-called &quot;Spadonari&quot; (sword-holders) dance is still performed between the end of January and the beginning of February. This dance is also connected with the rebirth of nature and vegetation.

In Romania, in a dance called Căluș, a sword dance similar to a Morris Dance, is part of a more complex ritualistic dance involving elements of fertility ritual and horse worship.

Hilt-and-point sword dances traditional to England include rapper sword and long sword, although both of these are now also performed by revival teams outside their traditional areas, including teams in most of the English-speaking world. English sword dancing has also been brought to the New World, initially as part of the &quot;morris revival&quot; of the 1970s and 1980s. Teams are now extant in most major metropolitan areas in North America. The New York City Sword Ale is an annual gathering over Presidents&#x27; Day weekend that brings together over a dozen sword teams form the east coast and around the world.

The Rugova war dance ( or &quot;Loja Luftarake e Rugovës&quot;) is a traditional Albanian war dance named after the Rugova region in Kosovo. The dance is considered a relic of the war dances (), the remnants of pantomimic dances performed in the re-enactment or preparation of battles. The dance is performed by two male dancers who fight a mock battle for the hand of a girl (a &quot;maiden&#x27;s dance&quot;).

<doc id="469034" wikidata="Q5871115" url="?curid=469034" title="History of women in the United States">
<text>The earliest women living in what is now the United States were Native Americans. European women arrived in the 17th century and brought with them European culture and values. During the 19th century, women were primarily restricted to domestic roles in keeping with Protestant values. The campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage in the United States culminated with the adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920. During World War II, many women filled roles vacated by men fighting overseas. Beginning in the 1960s, the second-wave feminist movement changed cultural perceptions of women, although it was unsuccessful in passing the Equal Rights Amendment. In the 21st century, women have achieved greater representation in prominent roles in American life.

The study of women&#x27;s history has been a major scholarly and popular field, with many scholarly books and articles, museum exhibits, and courses in schools and universities. The roles of women were long ignored in textbooks and popular histories. By the 1960s, women were being presented more often. An early feminist approach underscored their victimization and inferior status at the hands of men. In the 21st century, writers have emphasized the distinctive strengths displayed inside the community of women, with special concern for minorities among women.

==Colonial era==
Native American women previous to and during the time of Colonial America were highly regarded as leaders. Many Indigenous women had decision making power and were respected in their communities. After colonization, however, one of the first forms of assimilation that the Native American community experienced was reducing the role of Indigenous women to match the patriarchal status of the English/American women.

The experiences of women during the colonial era varied from colony to colony, but there were some overall patterns. Most of the British settlers were from England and Wales, with smaller numbers from Scotland and Ireland. Groups of families settled together in New England, while families tended to settle independently in the Southern colonies. The American colonies absorbed several thousands of Dutch and Swedish settlers. After 1700, most immigrants to Colonial America arrived as indentured servants—young unmarried men and women seeking a new life in a much richer environment. After the 1660s, a steady flow of black slaves arrived, chiefly from the Caribbean. Food supplies were much more abundant than in Europe, and there was an abundance of fertile land that needed farm families. However, the disease environment was hostile in the malaria-ridden South, where a large portion of the arrivals died within five years. The American-born children were immune from the fatal forms of malaria.

Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón&#x27;s unsuccessful American colony in 1526–1527 (San Miguel de Gualdape) involved about 600 colonizers, including women; only about 150 returned home alive.

The first English people to arrive in America were the members of the Roanoke Colony who came to North Carolina in July 1587, with 17 women, 91 men, and 9 boys as the founding colonists. On August 18, 1587, Virginia Dare was born in the colony; she was the first English child born in the territory of the United States. Her mother was Eleanor Dare, the daughter of John White, governor of the Roanoke colony. It is not known what happened to the members of the Roanoke colony.

===Virginia===

Jamestown, the first English settlement in America, was established in 1607 in what is now Virginia. In 1608 the first English women (two of them, Mistress Forrest and her maid Anne Burras) arrived in Jamestown. Burras became the first English woman to marry in the New World, and her daughter Virginia Laydon was the first child of English colonists to be born in Jamestown.

The first Africans since those in Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón&#x27;s unsuccessful colony in 1526–1527 (San Miguel de Gualdape) were brought to Jamestown in 1619; they consisted of about twenty people, including at least one woman. They were captives originally from the Kingdom of Ndongo in modern Angola, who had been part of a larger group heading to Mexico, and were taken after an attack on their Portuguese slave ship by English privateers. Their arrival is seen as a beginning of the history of slavery in Virginia and also as a starting point for African-American history, given that they were the first such group in mainland British America.

Also in 1619, 90 young single women from England went to Jamestown to become wives of the men there, with the women being auctioned off for 150 pounds of tobacco each (to be paid to the shipping company), as that was the cost of each woman&#x27;s travel to America. Such voyagers were often called &quot;tobacco brides&quot;. There were many such voyages to America for this purpose (the 1619 voyage being the first), with the tobacco brides promised free passage and trousseaus for their trouble.

===New England===
In New England, the Puritan settlers from England brought their strong religious values and highly organized social structure with them. They believed a woman should dedicate herself to rearing God-fearing children to the best of her ability.

There were ethnic differences in the treatment of women. Among Puritan settlers in New England, wives almost never worked in the fields with their husbands. In German communities in Pennsylvania, however, many women worked in fields and stables. German and Dutch immigrants granted women more control over property, which was not permitted in the local English law. Unlike English colonial wives, German and Dutch wives owned their own clothes and other items and were also given the ability to write wills disposing of the property brought into the marriage.
The New England regional economy grew rapidly in the 17th century, thanks to heavy immigration, high birth rates, low death rates, and an abundance of inexpensive farmland. The population grew from 3000 in 1630 to 14,000 in 1640, 33,000 in 1660, 68,000 in 1680, and 91,000 in 1700. Between 1630 and 1643, about 20,000 Puritans arrived, settling mostly near Boston; after 1643 fewer than fifty immigrants a year arrived. The average size of a completed family 1660–1700 was 7.1 children; the birth rate was 49 babies per year per 1000 people, and the death rate was about 22 deaths per year per 1000 people. About 27 percent of the population comprised men between 16 and 60 years old.

The benefits of economic growth were widely distributed, with even farm laborers better off at the end of the colonial period. The growing population led to shortages of good farm land on which young families could establish themselves; one result was to delay marriage, and another was to move to new lands further west. In the towns and cities, there was strong entrepreneurship, and a steady increase in the specialization of labor. Wages for men went up steadily before 1775; new occupations were opening for women, including weaving, teaching, and tailoring. The region bordered New France, which used Indian warriors to attack outlying villages. Women were sometimes captured. In the numerous French and Indian Wars the British government poured money in to purchase supplies, build roads and pay colonial soldiers. The coastal ports began to specialize in fishing, international trade and shipbuilding—and after 1780 in whaling. Combined with a growing urban markets for farm products, these factors allowed the economy to flourish despite the lack of technological innovation.

====Schooling====
Tax-supported schooling for girls began as early as 1767 in New England. It was optional and some towns proved reluctant. Northampton, Massachusetts, for example, was a late adopter because it had many rich families who dominated the political and social structures and they did not want to pay taxes to aid poor families. Northampton assessed taxes on all households, rather than only on those with children, and used the funds to support a grammar school to prepare boys for college. Not until after 1800 did Northampton educate girls with public money. In contrast, the town of Sutton, Massachusetts, was diverse in terms of social leadership and religion at an early point in its history. Sutton paid for its schools by means of taxes on households with children only, thereby creating an active constituency in favor of universal education for both boys and girls.

Historians point out that reading and writing were different skills in the colonial era. School taught both, but in places without schools reading was mainly taught to boys and also a few privileged girls. Men handled worldly affairs and needed to read and write. Girls only needed to read (especially religious materials). This educational disparity between reading and writing explains why the colonial women often could read, but could not write so they used an &quot;X&quot; to sign their names.

===Hispanic New Mexico===
Hispanic women played a central role in traditional family life in the Spanish colonies of New Mexico; their descendants comprise a large element in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado. Gutierrez finds a high level of illegitimacy, especially among the Indians who were used as slaves. He finds, &quot;Aristocrats maintained mistresses and/or sexually exploited to their slaves but rarely admitted to fathering illegitimate children.&quot;

===Colonial personalities and activities===
====Pocahontas====
The American Indian woman has been seen as a symbolic paradox. Depending on the perspective, she has been viewed as either the &quot;civilized princess&quot; or the &quot;destructive squaw&quot;. A highly favorable image has surrounded Pocahontas, the daughter of the Native American chief Powhatan in Virginia. John Smith himself said she saved him from being clubbed to death by her father in 1607, though there is some doubt as to whether this is what really happened. She was taken hostage by the colonists in 1612, when she was seventeen. She converted to Christianity and married planter John Rolfe in 1614. It was the first recorded interracial marriage in American history. This marriage brought a peace between the colonists and the Indians. She and Rolfe sailed to England in 1616, where she was presented at the court of King James I; she died soon after. Townsend argues that Pocahontas was not a powerful princess, but just one of many of the chief&#x27;s daughters. She was assertive, youthful, and athletic; she returns Rolfe&#x27;s love while also observing the Algonquin practice of constructing alliances through marriage, and she accepts Christianity as complementing her Algonquin religious worldview. Many leading families in Virginia to this day proudly claim her as an ancestor. Pocahontas quickly became part of early American folklore, reflecting myth, culture, romanticism, colonialism, and historical events as well as narratives of intermarriage, heroic women, and gender and sexuality as metaphors for national, religious, and racial differences.

====Eliza Pinckney====
Eliza Pinckney ( Elizabeth Lucas; December 28, 1722 May 27, 1793) transformed agriculture in colonial South Carolina, where she developed indigo as one of its most important cash crops. Its cultivation and processing as dye produced one-third the total value of the colony&#x27;s exports before the Revolutionary War. The manager of three plantations, Eliza Pinckney had a major influence on the colonial economy.

====Cecily Jordan Farrar====
Cecily Jordan Farrar was an early woman settler of colonial Jamestown. She came to the colony as a child aboard the &quot;Swan&quot; in 1610. Arriving in the middle of the first Anglo-Powhatan war, she established herself as one of the few female ancient planters. She married Samuel Jordan sometime before 1620. After Samuel&#x27;s death in 1623, Cecily established herself as one of the heads of household at Jordan&#x27;s Journey. In the same year, Cecily became the defendant in the first breach of promise lawsuit in English North America when she chose the marriage proposal of William Farrar over that of Grivell Pooley (see Cecily Jordan v. Greville Pooley dispute). 
====Mayflower women====
On November 21, 1620, the Mayflower arrived in what is today Provincetown, Massachusetts, bringing the Puritan pilgrims. There were 102 people aboard – 18 married women traveling with their husbands, seven unmarried women traveling with their parents, three young unmarried women, one girl, and 73 men. Three fourths of the women died in the first few months; while the men were building housing and drinking fresh water the women were confined to the damp and crowded quarters of the ship. By the time of the first Thanksgiving in autumn 1621, there were only four women from the Mayflower left alive.

====Anne Hutchinson====
In the 1630s, Anne Hutchinson (1591–1643) began to hold religious meetings in her home, which attracted the attendance not only of women but of prominent men, including affluent young civil officials. Hutchinson&#x27;s charisma indeed was so great that it became a threat to the ability of the clergy to govern; this was especially clear when some of her male supporters refused to join the militia in pursuit of Pequot natives. The authorities, led by Reverend John Winthrop (who was also the colony&#x27;s governor), first attacked her indirectly by banishing her brother-in-law, a minister who shared her views. Hutchinson herself was summoned to trial late in 1637 and also banished, but allowed to remain under house arrest until the end of winter. In March 1638, she was again brought before the court and formally excommunicated; she and her children soon joined her husband, who had prepared a home for them in the new colony of Rhode Island, which had been founded less than two years earlier by other dissidents exiled from Massachusetts. At nearly 47, In 1660, Mary Dyer, a Quaker who had been among Hutchinson&#x27;s followers, was hanged in Massachusetts for repeatedly returning to Massachusetts and proselytizing for Quakerism.

====Enslaved women====
In 1655, Elizabeth Key Grinstead, who was enslaved in Virginia, won her freedom in a lawsuit based on her father&#x27;s status as a free Englishman (her mother was a slave and her father was her mother&#x27;s owner), helped by the fact that her father had baptized her as Christian in the Church of England. However, in 1662 the Virginia House of Burgesses passed a law stating that any child born in the colony would follow the status of its mother, slave or free. This was an overturn of a longheld principle of English Common Law, whereby a child&#x27;s status followed that of the father; it enabled white men who raped enslaved women to hide the mixed-race children born as a result and removed their responsibility to acknowledge, support, or emancipate those children.
When Europeans began to arrive in the New World, many indigenous people converted. As a result, religion was less useful as a way to differentiate and skin color became more important. Many elite men had children with enslaved people. Pregnancy out of wedlock was encouraged among nonwhite women as the children would become workers/enslaved. The number of births out of wedlock in Latin America was much higher than in Europe. On the other hand, unmarried white women who had mixed-race children were treated worse than those who had white children. Despite the expectation of men to father mixed-raced children with nonwhite women, rape of a woman by a black man could lead to castration and European women who married indigenous men lost their &quot;European&quot; status. As more white women moved to the new colonies, interracial sex became less common since Europeans became concerned with &quot;racial survival&quot;.

====Witches====
In the small Puritan community of Salem Village, Massachusetts, the Salem witch trials began in 1692. They began when a group of girls gathered in the evenings in the home of Reverend Parris to listen to stories told by one of his slaves, Tituba. They played fortune-telling games, which were strictly forbidden by the Puritans. The girls began acting strangely, leading the Puritan community to suspect that the girls were victims of witchcraft. The girls named three townswomen as witches – Tituba, Sarah Good, and Sarah Osbourne; Tituba confessed to having seen the devil and also stated that there was a coven of witches in the Salem Village area. The other two women insisted they were innocent, but had a formal legal trial where they were found guilty of practicing witchcraft.

The affected girls accused other townspeople of torturing them with witchcraft, and some on trial also named others as witches. By the end of the trials in 1693, 24 people had died, some in jail but 19 by hanging, and one by being pressed to death. Some of the accused confessed to being witches, but none of those were hanged, only those who maintained their innocence; those who were hanged include 13 women and 6 men.

Salem was the beginning, but it was quickly followed by witchcraft scares in 24 other Puritan communities, with 120 more accused witches. Outside Salem, the episodes were short and not dramatic, and usually involved only one or two people. Most were older women, often widowed or single, with a history of bickering and disputes with neighbors. In October 1692, the governor of Massachusetts halted court proceedings, restricted new arrests, and then dissolved the Court of Oyer and Terminer, thereby ending the witch hunts.

====Housewives====
&quot;Housewife&quot; (called a &quot;Goodwife&quot; in New England) refers to the married women&#x27;s economic and cultural roles. Under legal rules of &quot;coverture,&quot; a wife had no separate legal identity; everything she did was under her authority of her husband. He controlled all the money, including any dowry or inheritance she might have brought to the marriage. She had certain legal rights to a share of the family property when the husband died. She was in charge of feeding, cleaning and medical care for everyone in the household, as well as supervising the servants. The housewife&#x27;s domain, depending upon wealth, would also include &quot;cellars, pantries, brew houses, milk houses, wash houses and butteries&quot;. She was responsible for home manufacturing of clothing, candles, and foodstuffs. 
At harvest time she helped the menfolk gather the crops. She typically kept a vegetable garden, and cared for the poultry and milked the cows. The husband handled the other livestock and the dogs. Mothers were responsible for the spiritual and civic well being of her children. Good housewives raised good children who would become upstanding citizens in the community. Legal statutes and societal norms allowed for husbands to exert physical power over their wives, which could result in violence. A few housewives were able to file for divorces.

====Writers====
In 1650, Anne Dudley Bradstreet became America&#x27;s first published poet, with the publication of her book of poetry entitled &quot;The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung up in America&quot;. It was also published in London that same year, making Bradstreet the first female poet ever published in both England and the New World. Bradstreet linked sexual and cultural reproduction and posited the nuclear family as the place where individual and community identities are formed; she located education within a familial rather than an institutional setting.
The earliest known work of literature by an African American and by a slave, Lucy Terry&#x27;s poem &quot;Bars Fight,&quot; was composed in 1746 and was first published in 1855 in Josiah Holland&#x27;s &quot;History of Western Massachusetts The poem describes a violent incident that occurred between settlers and Native Americans in Deerfield, Massachusetts in 1746. Former slave Phillis Wheatley became a literary sensation in 1770 after she wrote a poem on the death of the evangelical preacher George Whitefield. In 1773, 39 of Phillis Wheatley&#x27;s poems were published in London as a book entitled &quot;Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral&quot;. This was the first published book by an African American.

====One voter====
In 1756, Lydia Chapin Taft of Uxbridge, Massachusetts became the only colonial woman known to vote, casting a vote in the local town hall meeting in place of her deceased husband. From 1775 until 1807, the state constitution in New Jersey permitted all persons worth fifty pounds who resided in the state for one year to vote; free black people and single women therefore had the vote until 1807, but not married women, as their property ownership was invariably limited.

====Great Awakening====

In the 1740s evangelists ignited a religious revival—called the First Great Awakening—which energized Protestants up and down the 13 colonies. It was characterized by ecstatic emotionalism and egalitarianism, which split several denominations into old and new factions. They expanded their membership among the white farmers; women were especially active in the Methodist and Baptist churches that were springing up everywhere. Although the women were rarely allowed to preach, they had a voice and a vote in church affairs, and were especially interested in close monitoring of the moral behavior of church members. The Awakening led many women to be introspective; some kept diaries or wrote memoirs. The autobiography of Hannah Heaton (1721–94), a farm wife of North Haven, Connecticut, tells of her experiences in the Great Awakening, her encounters with Satan, her intellectual and spiritual development, and life on the farm.

The evangelicals worked hard to convert the slaves to Christianity and were especially successful among black women, who played the role of religious specialists in Africa and again in America. Slave women exercised wide-ranging spiritual leadership among Africans in America in healing and medicine, church discipline, and revivalistic enthusiasm.

===American Revolution===
====The coming of the Revolution====
Using the colonies of Virginia and Maryland as a case study, Mellen argues that women in the mid-18th century had a significant role in the world of print and the public sphere. The voice of women was spread through books, newspapers, and popular almanacs. Some women writers sought equal treatment under the law and became involved in public debates even before the Stamp Act controversy of 1765.

A powerful coercive tool the Americans used to protest British policies after 1765 was the boycott of imported British consumer goods. Women played an active role in encouraging patriotic boycotts and monitoring compliance. They refused to purchase imports, while emphasizing the virtues of avoiding luxury by using homespun clothing and other locally made products.

====The impact of the Revolution====
The Revolution had a deep effect on the philosophical underpinnings of American society. One aspect that was drastically changed by the democratic ideals of the Revolution was the roles of women.

The idea of republican motherhood was born in this period and reflects the importance of Republicanism as the dominant American ideology. Republicanism assumed that a successful republic rested upon the virtue of its citizens. Thus, women had the essential role of instilling their children with values conducive to a healthy republic. During this period, the wife&#x27;s relationship with her husband also became more liberal, as love and affection instead of obedience and subservience began to characterize the ideal marital relationship. In addition, many women contributed to the war effort through fundraising and running family businesses in the absence of husbands.

Whatever gains they had made, however, women still found themselves subordinated, legally and socially, to their husbands, disenfranchised and with only the role of mother open to them.
Deborah Sampson was the only woman historians know of who fought disguised as a man in the Revolutionary War. In 1782, she disguised herself as a man and joined the 4th Massachusetts Regiment. When her gender was finally discovered she was given an honorable discharge. Many women were attached to the Army to help their husbands, and to handle cooking and cleaning. In 1776, Margaret Corbin fired her husband&#x27;s cannon after he was killed; she was herself severely wounded in the battle. She received a pension from Congress in recognition of her service, making her the first American woman ever to receive a government pension. At the battle of Monmouth in 1778, Mary Ludwig Hays McCauley fired her husband&#x27;s cannon after he was wounded in battle. Her story morphed into the &quot;Molly Pitcher&quot; legend.

In March 1776, Abigail Adams wrote to her husband John Adams, a leader in the Continental Congress, recommending &quot;In the new code of laws which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make, I desire you would remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the husbands.&quot; Her husband wrote back, &quot;As to your extraordinary code of laws, I cannot but laugh...Depend upon it, we know better than to repeal our masculine systems.&quot;

Zagarri argues the Revolution created an ongoing debate on the rights of woman and created an environment favorable to women&#x27;s participation in politics. She asserts that for a brief decade, a &quot;comprehensive transformation in women&#x27;s rights, roles, and responsibilities seemed not only possible but perhaps inevitable.&quot; women took a small but visible role in the public sphere after 1783. First Lady Martha Washington sponsored social events in the national capital. The socializing became known as &quot;the Republican Court&quot; and provided elite women with an opportunity to play backstage political role. This reached a climax in the Petticoat affair of 1830, in which the wives of President Andrew Jackson&#x27;s cabinet members humiliated the wife of the Secretary of War, leading to a political crisis for the president.

However the opening of possibilities also engendered a backlash that actually set back the cause of women&#x27;s rights and led to a greater rigidity that marginalized women from political life.

====Quakers====
Quakers were strong in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and had developed equalitarian views of the role of women. They believed that all human beings, regardless of sex, had the same Inner light. Quakers were represented among the Founding Fathers by John Dickinson and Thomas Mifflin, although Mifflin was expelled by the Society of Friends because of his leadership role in the Continental Army.

==1800–1900==

=== Sacagawea ===
The best known Indian woman after Pocahontas was Sacagawea (1788–1812), who accompanied the Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804–1806) overland expedition to the Pacific coast and back. The two captains hired her husband, a fur trapper, as an interpreter, with the understanding that she would come along to interpret the Shoshone language, which she did. Sacagawea was only about 16 and delivered a son on the trip. Her role has been greatly exaggerated, in large part because writers wanted to use her as an Indian endorsement of Manifest Destiny.

===Midwestern pioneers===
Clear-cut gender norms prevailed among the farm families who settled in the Midwestern region between 1800 and 1840. Men were the breadwinners who considered the profitability of farming in a particular location – or &quot;market-minded agrarianism&quot; – and worked hard to provide for their families. They had an almost exclusive voice regarding public matters, such as voting and handling the money. During the migration westward, women&#x27;s diaries show little interest in and financial problems, but great concern with the threat of separation from family and friends. Furthermore, women experienced a physical toll because they were expected to have babies, supervise the domestic chores, care for the sick, and take control of the garden crops and poultry. Outside the German American community, women rarely did fieldwork on the farm. The women set up neighborhood social organizations, often revolving around church membership, or quilting parties. They exchanged information and tips on child-rearing, and helped each other in childbirth.

===Reform movements===
Many women in the 19th century were involved in reform movements, particularly abolitionism.

In 1831, Maria W. Stewart (who was African-American) began to write essays and make speeches against slavery, promoting educational and economic self-sufficiency for African Americans. The first woman of any color to speak on political issues in public, Stewart gave her last public speech in 1833 before retiring from public speaking to work in women&#x27;s organizations.

Although her career was short, it set the stage for the African-American women speakers who followed; Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Sojourner Truth, and Harriet Tubman, among others. Since more direct participation in the public arena was fraught with difficulties and danger, many women assisted the movement by boycotting slave-produced goods and organizing fairs and food sales to raise money for the cause.

To take one example of the danger, Pennsylvania Hall was the site in 1838 of the Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women, and as 3,000 white and black women gathered to hear prominent abolitionists such as Maria Weston Chapman, the speakers&#x27; voices were drowned out by the mob which had gathered outside. When the women emerged, arms linked in solidarity, they were stoned and insulted. The mob returned the following day and burned the hall, which had been inaugurated only three days earlier, to the ground.

Furthermore, the Grimké sisters from South Carolina (Angelina and Sarah Grimké), received much abuse and ridicule for their abolitionist activity, which consisted of traveling throughout the North, lecturing about their first-hand experiences with slavery on their family plantation.

Even so, many women&#x27;s anti-slavery societies were active before the Civil War, the first one having been created in 1832 by free black women from Salem, Massachusetts Fiery abolitionist Abby Kelley Foster was an ultra-abolitionist, who also led Lucy Stone, and Susan B. Anthony into the anti-slavery movement.

===Education===
In 1821, Emma Willard founded the Troy Female Seminary in Troy, New York, which was the first American educational institution to offer young women a pre-college education equal to that given to young men. Students at this private secondary school for girls were taught academic subjects that usually were reserved for males. Subjects included algebra, anatomy, natural philosophy and geography.
Mary Lyon (1797–1849) founded Mount Holyoke Female Seminary in 1837. It was the first college opened for women and is now Mount Holyoke College, one of the Seven Sisters. Lyon was a deeply religious Congregationalist who, although not a minister, preached revivals at her school. She greatly admired colonial theologian Jonathan Edwards for his theology and his ideals of self-restraint, self-denial, and disinterested benevolence. Georgia Female College, now Wesleyan College opened in 1839 as the first Southern college for women.

Oberlin College opened in 1833 as Oberlin Collegiate Institute, in the heavily Yankee northeastern corner of Ohio. In 1837, it became the first coeducational college by admitting four women. Soon women were fully integrated into the college, and comprised from a third to a half of the student body. The religious founders, especially evangelical theologian Charles Grandison Finney, saw women as inherently morally superior to men. Indeed, many alumnae, inspired by this sense of superiority and their personal duty to fulfill God&#x27;s mission engaged in missionary work. Historians have typically presented coeducation at Oberlin as an enlightened societal development presaging the future evolution of the ideal of equality for women in higher education

The enrollment of women in higher education grew steadily after the Civil War. In 1870, 8,300 women comprised 21% of all college students. In 1930, 480,000 women comprised 44% of the student body.

===Asylums and health===
Women were heavily involved with the rights of people confined in institutions. Dorothea Dix (1802–1887) was especially well known. She investigated the conditions of many jails, mental hospitals, and almshouses, and presented her findings to state legislatures, leading to reforms and the building of 30 new asylums. In the Civil War she became the Union&#x27;s Superintendent of Female Nurses. Many women worked at prison reform, and health reform.

===Feminism===
Judith Sargent Murray published the early and influential essay &quot;On the Equality of the Sexes&quot; in 1790, blaming poor standards in female education as the root of women&#x27;s problems. However, scandals surrounding the personal lives of English contemporaries Catharine Macaulay and Mary Wollstonecraft pushed feminist authorship into private correspondence from the 1790s through the early decades of the nineteenth century. Feminist essays from John Neal, particularly those in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Yankee&quot; in the 1820s, filled an intellectual gap between Murray and the leaders of the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention, which is generally considered the beginning of the first wave of feminism. As a male writer insulated from many common forms of attack against female feminist thinkers, Neal&#x27;s advocacy was crucial to bringing feminism back into the American mainstream.

The 1848 Convention was inspired by the fact that in 1840, when Elizabeth Cady Stanton met Lucretia Mott at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, the conference refused to seat Mott and other women delegates from America because of their gender. Stanton, the young bride of an antislavery agent, and Mott, a Quaker preacher and veteran of reform, talked then of calling a convention to address the condition of women.

An estimated three hundred women and men attended the Convention, including notables Lucretia Mott and Frederick Douglass. At the conclusion, 68 women and 32 men signed the &quot;Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions&quot;, which was written by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and the M&#x27;Clintock family.
The style and format of the &quot;Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions&quot; was that of the &quot;Declaration of Independence;&quot; for example the &quot;Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions&quot; stated, &quot;We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men and women are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights.&quot; The Declaration further stated, &quot;The history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man towards woman.&quot;

The declaration went on to specify female grievances in regard to the laws denying married women ownership of wages, money, and property (all of which they were required to turn over to their husbands; laws requiring this, in effect throughout America, were called coverture laws), women&#x27;s lack of access to education and professional careers, and the lowly status accorded women in most churches. Furthermore, the Declaration declared that women should have the right to vote.
2 weeks later, some of the participants in the Seneca Falls Convention organized the Rochester Women&#x27;s Rights Convention in Rochester, New York. This convention elected Abigail Bush as its president, making it the first public meeting composed of both men and women in the U.S. to choose a woman as its presiding officer. It was followed by other state and local conventions in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. The first National Woman&#x27;s Rights Convention was held in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1850. Women&#x27;s rights conventions were held regularly from 1850 until the start of the Civil War.

===Medicine===
In 1849, Elizabeth Blackwell (1821–1910), graduated from Geneva Medical College in New York at the head of her class and thus became the first female doctor in America. In 1857, she and her sister Emily, and their colleague Marie Elisabeth Zakrzewska (1829–1902), founded the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children, the first American hospital run by women and the first dedicated to serving women and children.

===Industry===
The rapid growth of textile manufacturing in New England 1815–1860 caused a shortage of workers. Recruiters were hired by mill agents to enlist young women. Between 1830 and 1850, thousands of unmarried farm women moved from rural areas, where there was no paid employment, to the nearby mill villages. Farmers&#x27; daughters worked to aid their families financially, save for marriage, and widen their horizons. As the textile industry grew, immigration also grew. By the 1850s the mill owners replaced all the Yankee girls with immigrants, especially Irish and French Canadians.

===Abolitionists===
Women continued to be active in reform movements in the second half of the 19th century. In 1851, former slave Sojourner Truth gave a famous speech, called &quot;Ain&#x27;t I a Woman?&quot;, at the Women&#x27;s Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio. In this speech she condemned the attitude that women were too weak to have equal rights with men, noting the hardships she herself had endured as a slave. In 1852, Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote the abolitionist book &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. Begun as a serial for the Washington anti-slavery weekly, the National Era, the book focused public interest on the issue of slavery, and was deeply controversial for its strong anti-slavery stance at the time it was written. In writing the book, Stowe drew on her personal experience: she was familiar with slavery, the antislavery movement, and the Underground Railroad because Kentucky, across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, Ohio, where Stowe had lived, was a slave state. &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; was a best-seller, selling 10,000 copies in the United States in its first week; 300,000 in the first year; and in Great Britain, 1.5 million copies in one year. Following publication of the book, Harriet Beecher Stowe became a celebrity, speaking against slavery both in America and Europe. She wrote &quot;A Key to Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; in 1853, extensively documenting the realities on which the book was based, to refute critics who tried to argue that it was inauthentic; and published a second anti-slavery novel, &quot;Dred&quot;, in 1856. Later, when she visited President Abraham Lincoln, the family&#x27;s oral tradition states that he greeted her as &quot;the little lady who made this big war.&quot; Campaigners for other social changes, such as Caroline Norton who campaigned for women&#x27;s rights, respected and drew upon Stowe&#x27;s work.

In the years before the Civil War, Harriet Tubman, a runaway slave herself, freed more than 70 slaves over the course of 13 secret rescue missions to the South. In June 1863, Harriet Tubman became the first woman to plan and execute an armed expedition in United States history. Acting as an advisory to Colonel James Montgomery and his 300 soldiers, Tubman led them in a raid in South Carolina from Port Royal to the interior, some twenty-five miles up the Combahee River, where they freed approximately 800 slaves.

===Civil War===
====Civil War North====

During the American Civil War (1861–1865) Dorothea Dix served as the Union&#x27;s Superintendent of Female Nurses throughout the war, and was in charge of all female nurses working in army hospitals, which was over 3,000 nurses. Women provided casualty care and nursing to Union and Confederate troops at field hospitals and on the Union Hospital Ship &quot;Red Rover&quot;. Dr. Mary Edwards Walker served as assistant surgeon with General Burnside&#x27;s Union forces in 1862 and with an Ohio regiment in East Tennessee the following year. Imprisoned in Richmond as a spy, she was eventually released and returned to serve as a hospital surgeon at a women&#x27;s prisoner-of-war hospital in Louisville, Kentucky. After the war, President Andrew Johnson awarded her the Medal of Honor, making her the only woman ever to receive the United States&#x27; highest military honor. The number of female soldiers who served in disguise was perhaps 400 to 750.

====Confederacy====

At the start southern women gave zealous support for their menfolk going off to war. They saw the men as protectors and invested heavily in the romantic idea of men fighting to defend the honor of their country, family, and way of life. Mothers and wives were able to keep in contact with their loved ones who had chosen to enlist by writing them letters. African American women, on the other hand, had experienced the breakup of families for generations and were once again dealing with this issue at the outbreak of war.
By summer 1861, the Union naval blockade virtually shut down the export of cotton and the import of manufactured goods. Food that formerly came overland was cut off.

Women had charge of making do. They cut back on purchases, brought out old spinning wheels and enlarged their gardens with peas and peanuts to provide clothing and food. They used ersatz substitutes when possible, but there was no real coffee and it was hard to develop a taste for the okra or chicory substitutes used. The households were severely hurt by inflation in the cost of everyday items and the shortages of food, fodder for the animals, and medical supplies for the wounded. The Georgia legislature imposed cotton quotas, making it a crime to grow an excess. But food shortages only worsened, especially in the towns.

The overall decline in food supplies, made worse by the collapsing transportation system, led to serious shortages and high prices in urban areas. When bacon reached a dollar a pound in 1863, the poor women of Richmond, Atlanta and many other cities began to riot; they broke into shops and warehouses to seize food. The women expressed their anger at ineffective state relief efforts, speculators, merchants and planters. As wives and widows of soldiers they were hurt by the inadequate welfare system.

===Postwar South===
About 250,000 Southern soldiers never came home, or 30% of all white men aged 18 to 40 in 1860. Widows who were overwhelmed often abandoned the farm and merged into the households of relatives, or even became refugees living in camps with high rates of disease and death. In the Old South, being an &quot;old maid&quot; was something of an embarrassment to the woman and her family. Now it became almost a norm. Some women welcomed the freedom of not having to marry. Divorce, while never fully accepted, became more common. The concept of the &quot;New Woman&quot; emerged—she was self-sufficient, independent, and stood in sharp contrast to the &quot;Southern Belle&quot; of antebellum lore.

The work patterns of elite white women changed radically after the Civil War, depending on their stage in the life cycle. Women over age 50 changed least, insisting that they needed servants and continuing their traditional managerial roles. The next generation, comprising the young wives and mothers during the Civil War, depended much less on black servants, and displayed greater flexibility toward household work. The youngest generation, which matured during the war and Reconstruction, did many of their own domestic chores. Some sought paid jobs outside the household, especially in teaching, which allowed an escape from domestic chores and obligatory marriage.

===Settling the Great Plains===
The arrival of the railroads in the 1870s open up the Great Plains for settlement, for now it was possible to ship wheat and other crops at low cost to the urban markets in the East, and Europe. Immigrants poured in, especially from Germany and Scandinavia. On the plains, very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch by themselves; they clearly understood the need for a hard-working wife, and numerous children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing the housework, feeding the hired hands, and, especially after the 1930s, handling the paperwork and financial details. During the early years of settlement in the late 19th century, farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors. After a generation or so, women increasingly left the fields, thus redefining their roles within the family. New conveniences such as sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles. The scientific housekeeping movement, promoted across the land by the farm magazines and (after 1914) by government extension agents, as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women in the farm papers, and home economics courses in the schools.
Although the eastern image of farm life in the prairies emphasized the isolation of the lonely farmer and farm wife, supposedly with few neighbors within range. In reality, they created a rich social life for themselves. They often sponsored activities that combined work, food, and entertainment such as barn raisings, corn huskings, quilting bees, Grange meetings, church activities, and school functions. The womenfolk organized shared meals and potluck events, as well as extended visits between families. The Grange was a nationwide farmers&#x27; organization; it reserved high offices for women, gave them a voice in public affairs, and promoted equality and suffrage.

===Suffrage===

The women&#x27;s suffrage movement began with the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention; many of the activists became politically aware during the abolitionist movement. The movement reorganized after the Civil War, gaining experienced campaigners, many of whom had worked for prohibition in the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union. By the end of the 19th century a few western states had granted women full voting rights, though women had made significant legal victories, gaining rights in areas such as property and child custody.

In 1866, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony formed the American Equal Rights Association, an organization for white and black women and men dedicated to the goal of suffrage for all. In 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment was passed, this was the first Amendment to ever specify the voting population as &quot;male&quot;. In 1869, the women&#x27;s rights movement split into two factions as a result of disagreements over the Fourteenth and soon-to-be-passed Fifteenth Amendments, with the two factions not reuniting until 1890. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony formed the more radical, New York-based National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA). Lucy Stone, Henry Blackwell, and Julia Ward Howe organized the more conservative American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), which was centered in Boston. In 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment enfranchised black men. NWSA refused to work for its ratification, arguing, instead, that it be &quot;scrapped&quot; in favor of a Sixteenth Amendment providing universal suffrage. Frederick Douglass broke with Stanton and Anthony over NWSA&#x27;s position.

In 1869, Wyoming became the first territory or state in America to grant women suffrage. In 1870, Louisa Ann Swain became the first woman in the United States to vote in a general election. She cast her ballot on September 6, 1870, in Laramie, Wyoming.

From 1870 to 1875 several women, including Virginia Louisa Minor, Victoria Woodhull, and Myra Bradwell, attempted to use the Fourteenth Amendment in the courts to secure the vote (Minor and Woodhull) or the right to practice law (Bradwell), but they were all unsuccessful. In 1872, Susan B. Anthony was arrested and brought to trial in Rochester, New York, for attempting to vote for Ulysses S. Grant in the presidential election; she was convicted and fined $100 and the costs of her prosecution but refused to pay. At the same time, Sojourner Truth appeared at a polling booth in Battle Creek, Michigan, demanding a ballot; she was turned away. Also in 1872, Victoria Woodhull became the first woman to run for President, although she could not vote and only received a few votes, losing to Ulysses S. Grant. She was nominated to run by the Equal Rights Party, and advocated the 8-hour work day, graduated income tax, social welfare programs, and profit sharing, among other positions. Victoria Woodhull was an activist for women&#x27;s rights and advocated for &quot; Free Love&quot; which focused on the right to marriage, divorce and child birth The double standards of men and their will was strong to keep women powerless. In addition, to resisting full equality between race and gender. It was an era of battling for what one believed and should be entitled to. Victoria Woodhull fought for her universal rights and took advantage of the amendments in her favor. Tensions were high during 1872, it was a pivotal year in Reconstruction politics and the death of radical republicanism in national politics. As nominees of The Equal Rights Party, Woodhull and Fredrick Douglas, provided a provocative campaign as the deliberately challenged the fear of miscegenation and gender bias. They restored hope and universal rights for everyone regardless of gender and race as well as offered to reunite divided reformers. Although Woodhull did not win election, her election demanded new political views and equal rights for everyone. In 1874, The Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) was founded by Annie Wittenmyer to work for the prohibition of alcohol; with Frances Willard at its head (starting in 1876), the WCTU also became an important force in the fight for women&#x27;s suffrage. In 1878, a woman suffrage amendment was first introduced in the United States Congress, but it did not pass.

===Domesticity===
Kristin Hoganson&#x27;s essay &#x27;Cosmopolitan Domesticity: Importing the American Dream, 1865–1920&#x27; sets out how &#x27;bourgeois American women, in their capacity as homemakers, participated in international relations&#x27;. After the Civil War, there was a boom in interior design writing, with many advocating the adoption of foreign styles throughout the household. Interior design in middle-class houses was seen at this time as an important means of self-expression, shown by the fact that a popular design manual commented that &#x27;We judge her [a woman&#x27;s] temperament, her habits, her inclinations, by the interior of her home&#x27;. Pre-war, foreign styles were usually limited to the European fashions, but in the second half of the century, objects were being imported from further afield. Women wanted to show their status through the extravagant interior design of their homes, but as Kristin Hoganson points out, &#x27;their decision to do so through exhibiting imported objects and replicating distant styles illuminates something beyond local jostling&#x27;. The increasingly expansionist nature of U.S. foreign policy post-civil war contributed to the level of interest in cosmopolitan interior design, as it led to an increased geographical awareness amongst the middle classes of America through travel writings, photographs, missionary exhibits, etc. Moreover, it was not just tourists who were bringing foreign goods and ideas back to America; it was also via missionaries, professionals, businessmen, servicemen and government agents.

===Cult of Domesticity===
The &quot;Cult of Domesticity&quot; was a new ideal of womanhood that emerged at this time. This ideal rose from the reality that a 19th-century middle-class family did not have to make what it needed in order to survive, as previous families had to, and therefore men could now work in jobs that produced goods or services while their wives and children stayed at home. The ideal woman became one who stayed at home and taught children how to be proper citizens. &quot;American Cookery&quot; written in 1796 by Amelia Simmons, was the first published cookbook written by an American. It was popular and was published in many editions.

The culture of honor in the antebellum South was linked to women&#x27;s social status and Southern evangelicalism. There were no sharp gender lines such that women strictly inhabited the realm of evangelicalism while men upheld honor. Women felt subject to notions of honor related to patriarchy, sexuality, class identity, and virtue. The different sex roles inhabited by Southern men and women affected masculine and feminine honor, as is the moral authority women held over men.

===Jobs and professions===
Many young women worked as servants or in shops and factories until marriage, then typically became full-time housewives. However black, Irish and Swedish adult women often worked as servants. After 1860, as the larger cities opened department stores, middle-class women did most of the shopping; increasingly they were served by young middle-class women clerks. Typically, most young women quit their jobs when they married. In some ethnic groups, however, married women were encouraged to work, especially among African-Americans, and Irish Catholics. When the husband operated a small shop or restaurant, wives and other family members could find employment there. Widows and deserted wives often operated boarding houses. However, despite this, the unemployment rate amongst black women in the Southern states remained high peaking at 80% in 1900.

Career women were few. The teaching profession had once been heavily male, but as schooling expanded many women took on teaching careers. If they remained unmarried they could have a prestigious, poorly paying lifetime career. At the end of the period nursing schools opened up new opportunities for women, but medical schools remained nearly all male.

Business opportunities were very rare, unless it was a matter of a widow taking over her late husband&#x27;s small business. However the rapid acceptance of the sewing machine made housewives more productive and opened up new careers for women running their own small millinery and dressmaking shops.

American women achieved several firsts in the professions in the second half of the 1800s. In 1866, Lucy Hobbs Taylor became the first American woman to receive a dentistry degree. In 1878, Mary L. Page became the first woman in America to earn a degree in architecture when she graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 1879, Belva Lockwood became the first woman allowed to argue before the Supreme Court; the first case in which she did so was the 1880 case &quot;Kaiser v. Stickney&quot;. Arabella Mansfield had previously become America&#x27;s first female lawyer when she was admitted to the bar in 1869. In 1891, Marie Owens, born in Canada, was hired in Chicago as`America&#x27;s first female police officer. Due to women&#x27;s greater involvement in law and law enforcement, in 1871 the first state laws specifically making wife beating illegal were passed, though proliferation of laws to all states and adequate enforcement of those laws lagged very far behind. One of the first female photojournalists, Sadie Kneller Miller used her initials, SKM, as a byline, which hid her gender. She covered sports, disasters, diseases, and was recognized as the first female war correspondent.

===Missionaries===

By the 1860s Most of the large Protestant denominations developed missionary roles for women beyond that of the wife of a male missionary.
European Catholic women in their role as religious sisters worked in the immigrant enclaves of American cities. Mother Cabrini (1850–1917) founded the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Italy in 1880; she moved to New York in 1889. The orphanages, schools and hospitals built by her order provided major support to the Italian immigrants. She was canonized as a saint in 1946.

===Settlement houses===
In 1889, Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr established the first settlement house in America (a settlement house is a center in an underprivileged area that provides community services), in what was then a dilapidated mansion in one of the poorest immigrant slums of Chicago on the corner of Halstead and Polk streets. This settlement house, called Hull House, provided numerous activities and services including health and child care, clubs for both children and adults, an art gallery, kitchen, gymnasium, music school, theater, library, employment bureau, and a labor museum. By 1910, 400 settlement houses had been established in America; the majority of settlement house workers were women.

===Nursing===
During the Spanish–American War (1898) thousands of US soldiers sick with typhoid, malaria, and yellow fever overwhelmed the capabilities of the Army Medical Department, so Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee suggested to the Army Surgeon General that the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) be appointed to select professionally qualified nurses to serve under contract to the US Army. Before the war ended, 1,500 civilian contract nurses were assigned to Army hospitals in the US, Hawaii (not a state at that time), Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines, as well as to the hospital ship &quot;Relief&quot;. Twenty nurses died. The Army appointed Dr. McGee as Acting Assistant Surgeon General, making her the first woman ever to hold the position. The Army was impressed by the performance of its contract nurses and had Dr. McGee write legislation creating a permanent corps of Army nurses.

==Progressive era: 1900–1940==
Across the nation, middle-class women organized on behalf of social reforms during the Progressive Era. They were especially concerned with Prohibition, suffrage, school issues, and public health. Focusing on the General Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs, a national network of middle-class women who formed local clubs, historian Paige Meltzer puts the women&#x27;s clubs in the context of the Progressive Movement, arguing that its policies:
:built on Progressive-era strategies of municipal housekeeping. During the Progressive era, female activists used traditional constructions of womanhood, which imagined all women as mothers and homemakers, to justify their entrance into community affairs: as &quot;municipal housekeepers,&quot; they would clean up politics, cities, and see after the health and wellbeing of their neighbors. Donning the mantle of motherhood, female activists methodically investigated their community&#x27;s needs and used their &quot;maternal&quot; expertise to lobby, create, and secure a place for themselves in an emerging state welfare bureaucracy, best illustrated perhaps by clubwoman Julia Lathrop&#x27;s leadership in the Children&#x27;s Bureau. As part of this tradition of maternal activism, the Progressive-era General Federation supported a range of causes from the pure food and drug administration to public health care for mothers and children to a ban on child labor, each of which looked to the state to help implement their vision of social justice.

===Jane Addams===

One representative woman of the Progressive Era was Jane Addams (1860–1935). She was a pioneer social worker, leader of community activists at Hull House in Chicago, public philosopher, sociologist, author, and spokesperson for suffrage and world peace. Alongside presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, she was the most prominent reformer of the Progressive Era. She helped turn the nation&#x27;s attention to issues of concern to mothers, such as the needs of children, public health, and world peace. She said that if women were to be responsible for cleaning up their communities and making them better places to live, they needed the vote to be effective in doing so. Addams became a role model for middle-class women who volunteered to uplift their communities. In 1931, she became the first American woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Some critics in the 1960s portrayed her as an unoriginal racist determined to civilize helpless immigrants while other biographers in the 1990s tended to regard her more favorably.

===French Canadians===
French Canadian women saw New England as a place of opportunity and possibility where they could create economic alternatives for themselves distinct from the expectations of their subsistence farms in Quebec. By the early 20th century some saw temporary migration to the United States to work as a rite of passage and a time of self-discovery and self-reliance. Most moved permanently to the United States, using the inexpensive railroad system to visit Quebec from time to time. When these women did marry, they had fewer children with longer intervals between children than their Canadian counterparts. Some women never married, and oral accounts suggest that self-reliance and economic independence were important reasons for choosing work over marriage and motherhood. These women conformed to traditional gender ideals in order to retain their &#x27;Canadienne&#x27; cultural identity, but they also redefined these roles in ways that provided them increased independence in their roles as wives and mothers.

===Midwest===
Most young urban women took jobs before marriage, then quit. Before the growth of high schools after 1900, most women left school after the eighth grade aged around fifteen. Ciani (2005) shows that type of work they did reflected their ethnicity and marital status. African-American mothers often chose day labor, usually as domestic servants, because of the flexibility it afforded. Most mothers receiving pensions were white and sought work only when necessary.

Across the region, middle-class society women shaped numerous new and expanded charitable and professional associations, and promoted mother&#x27;s pensions, and expanded forms of social welfare. Many of the Protestant homemakers were active in the temperance and suffrage movements as well. In Detroit, the Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs (DFWC) promoted a very wide range of activities for civic-minded middle-class women who conformed to traditional gender roles. The Federation argued that safety and health issues were of greatest concern to mothers and could only be solved by improving municipal conditions outside the home. The Federation pressured Detroit officials to upgrade schools, water supplies and sanitation facilities, and to require safe food handling, and traffic safety. However, the membership was divided on going beyond these issues or collaborating with ethnic or groups or labor unions. Its refusal to stretch traditional gender boundaries, gave it a conservative reputation in the working-class. Before the 1930s, the women&#x27;s affiliates of labor unions were too small and weak to fill the gap.

===South===
 Rebecca Latimer Felton (1835–1930) was the most prominent woman leader in Georgia. Born into a wealthy plantation family, she married an active politician, managed his career, and became a political expert. An outspoken feminist, she became a leader of the prohibition and woman&#x27;s suffrage movements, endorsed lynching (white Southerners should &quot;lynch a thousand [black men] a week if it becomes necessary&quot; to prevent the rape of white women), fought for reform of prisons, and filled leadership roles in many reform organizations. In 1922, she was appointed to the U.S. Senate. She was sworn in on November 21, 1922, and served one day; she was the first woman to serve in the Senate.

Although middle class urban women were well-organized supporters of suffrage, the rural areas of the South were hostile. The state legislatures ignored efforts to let women vote in local elections. Georgia not only refused to ratify the Federal Nineteenth Amendment, but took pride in being the first to reject it. The Amendment passed nationally and Georgia women gained the right to vote in 1920. However, black women, as well as black men, continued to face substantial barriers designed to prevent black Americans from voting until the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 enforced their constitutional rights.

The woman&#x27;s reform movement flourished in cities; however the South was still heavily rural before 1945. In Dallas, Texas, women reformers did much to establish the fundamental elements of the social structure of the city, focusing their energies on families, schools, and churches during the city&#x27;s pioneer days. Many of the organizations which created a modern urban scene were founded and led by middle-class women. Through voluntary organizations and club work, they connected their city to national cultural and social trends. By the 1880s women in temperance and suffrage movements shifted the boundaries between private and public life in Dallas by pushing their way into politics in the name of social issues.

During 1913–19, advocates of woman suffrage in Dallas drew on the educational and advertising techniques of the national parties and the lobbying tactics of the women&#x27;s club movement. They also tapped into popular culture, successfully using popular symbolism and traditional ideals to adapt community festivals and social gatherings to the task of political persuasion. The Dallas Equal Suffrage Association developed a suffrage campaign based on social values and community standards. Community and social occasions served as recruiting opportunities for the suffrage cause, blunting its radical implications with the familiarity of customary events and dressing it in the values of traditional female behavior, especially propriety.

Black female reformers usually operated separately. Juanita Craft was a leader in the Texas civil rights movement through the Dallas NAACP. She focused on working with black youths, organizing them as the vanguard in protests against segregation practices in Texas.

===West===
The Progressive movement was especially strong in California, where it aimed to purify society of its corruption, and one way was to enfranchise supposedly &quot;pure&quot; women as voters in 1911, nine years before the 19th Amendment enfranchised women nationally in 1920. Women&#x27;s clubs flourished and turned a spotlight on issues such as public schools, dirt and pollution, and public health. California women were leaders in the temperance movement, moral reform, conservation, public schools, recreation, and other issues. The women did not often run for office—that was seen as entangling their purity in the inevitable backroom deals routine in politics.

===Health issues===
Bristow shows there was a gendered response of health caregivers to the 1918 flu pandemic that killed over 500,000 Americans. Male doctors were unable to cure the patients, and they felt like failures. Women nurses also saw their patients die, but they took pride in their success in fulfilling their professional role of caring for, ministering, comforting, and easing the last hours of their patients, and helping the families of the patients cope as well.

====Birth control====
In March 1873, the United States Congress passed the Comstock Act, which made it illegal to distribute birth control information or contraceptives through the U.S. postal system. Margaret Sanger was an influential campaigner for birth control rights, specifically for poor women, in the 1910s. She originally worked as a visiting nurse in the New York City&#x27;s tenements and wrote about sex education and women&#x27;s health.
In 1914, Sanger&#x27;s articles in &quot;The Woman Radical&quot; brought her a federal indictment for violating the Comstock Act (which since 1873 had banned the mailing of birth control devices and information on birth control devices, sexually transmitted diseases, human sexuality, and abortion). Sanger and her sister Ethel Byrne, also a nurse, opened the first birth control clinic in the United States in 1916, modeled after those Sanger had seen in the Netherlands. The police quickly closed it down but the publicity surrounding Sanger&#x27;s activities had made birth control a matter of public debate. In 1936, Margaret Sanger helped bring the case &quot;United States v. One Package&quot; to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The decision in that case allowed physicians in New York, Connecticut, and Vermont to legally mail birth control devices and information to married people. For unmarried people, the dissemination of birth control did not become legal until the 1972 Supreme Court decision &quot;Eisenstadt v. Baird&quot;.

===Suffrage===
The campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage picked up speed in the 1910s as the established women&#x27;s groups won in the western states and moved east, leaving the conservative South for last. Parades were favorite publicity devices. In 1916, Jeannette Rankin, a Republican from Montana, was elected to Congress and became the first woman to serve in any high federal office. A lifelong pacifist, she was one of fifty members of Congress who voted against entry into World War I in 1917, and the only member of Congress who voted against declaring war on Japan after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Alice Paul was the leader of a voting rights movement that courted arrest through nonviolent protests to publicize the injustice of denying women the vote. After 1920, Paul spent a half century as leader of the National Woman&#x27;s Party, which advocated for her Equal Rights Amendment to secure constitutional equality for women. It never passed, but she won a large degree of success with the inclusion of women as a group protected against discrimination by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. She insisted that her National Woman&#x27;s Party focus exclusively on the legal status of all women and resisted calls to address issues like birth control.

===International activity===
Women&#x27;s support for international missionary activity peaked in the 1900 to 1930 era. The Great Depression caused a dramatic cut back in funding for missions. Mainstream denominations generally transitioned to support for locally-controlled missions.

Black women increased their role in international women&#x27;s conferences and their independent travels abroad. Leaders, including Ida B. Wells, Hallie Quinn Brown, and Mary Church Terrell, addressed issues of American race and gender discrimination when they traveled abroad. The International Council of Women of the Darker Races brought together women of color to eliminate language, cultural, and regional barriers.

====Peace movement====
Jane Addams was a noted peace activist who founded the Woman&#x27;s Peace Party in 1915; it was the American branch of the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom, of which Addams was the first president in 1915. Addams received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931.

===World War I===

World War I was a total war, and the nation moved to mobilize its women for material and psychological support of the war effort in and out of the home. All the states organized women&#x27;s committees. Representative was the women&#x27;s state committee in North Carolina.
Motivated by the public service ideals of the Progressive Movement, it registered women for many volunteer services, promoted increased food production, and the elimination of wasteful cooking practices, helped maintain social services, worked to bolster moral well-being of white and black soldiers, improved public health and public schools, encouraged black participation in its programs, and helped with the devastating Spanish flu epidemic that struck worldwide in late 1918, with very high fatalities. The committee was generally successful in reaching middle-class white and black women, but it was handicapped by the condescension of male lawmakers, limited funding, and tepid responses from women on the farms and working-class districts.

Women served in the military as nurses, and in support roles. Tens of thousands were employed in the United States, and thousands more in France. The Army Nurse Corps (all female until 1955) was founded in 1901, and the Navy Nurse Corps (all female until 1964) was founded in 1908, and nurses in both served overseas at military hospitals during the war. During the course of the war, 21,480 Army nurses served in military hospitals in the United States and overseas and eighteen African-American Army nurses served stateside caring for German prisoners of war (POWs) and African-American soldiers. More than 1,476 Navy nurses served in military hospitals stateside and overseas. More than 400 military nurses died in the line of duty during World War I; the vast majority of these women died from a highly contagious form of influenza known as the &quot;Spanish Flu,&quot; which swept through crowded military camps and hospitals and ports of embarkation. In 1917, women were first able to join the Navy for jobs other than nurse; they were able to become yeomen, electricians (radio operators), and any other ratings necessary to the naval district operations. 13,000 women enlisted, and the majority became yeomen and were designated as yeoman (F) for female yeoman.

The Army employed 450 female telephone operators who served overseas, beginning in March 1918 and continuing until the war ended. These women, who retained their civilian status and were not officially considered veterans until 1978, were the members of the Signal Corps Female Telephone Operators Unit 25, better known as the &quot;Hello Girls&quot;. They were required to be fluent in both
French and English, and assisted the French and British, both allies of America, in communicating with each other. Over 300 women served in the Marines during World War One, performing duties within the United States so that the male Marines could fight overseas. After the war ended in 1918, American women were no longer allowed to serve in the military, except as nurses, until 1942. However, in 1920 a provision of the Army Reorganization Act granted military nurses the status of officers with &quot;relative rank&quot; from second lieutenant to major (but not full rights and privileges).

===19th amendment===
Like most major nations, the United States gave women the right to vote at the end of the war. The 19th Amendment to the Constitution, giving American women the right to vote, passed in 1920. It came up before the House of Representatives in 1918 with the two-thirds votes needed for passage barely within reach; Representative Frederick Hicks of New York had been at the bedside of his dying wife but left at her urging to support the cause. He provided the final, crucial vote, and then returned home for her funeral. However, the Senate failed to pass the amendment that year. The amendment was approved by Congress next year on June 4, 1919, and the states started ratifying. In 1920, Tennessee was the 36th to do so, meeting the 3/4s (of then 48 states) required for enactment; the remaining states ratified later.

The amendment passed the Tennessee Senate easily. However, as it moved on to the House, vigorous opposition came from people in the liquor industry, who thought that if women got the vote, they would use it to pass Prohibition. The House ratified by one vote. It officially became part of the Constitution when it was certified as law on August 26, 1920; August 26 later became known as Women&#x27;s Equality Day. 
Suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt calculated that the campaign for women&#x27;s right to vote had involved 56 referendum campaigns directed at male voters, plus 480 campaigns to get Legislatures to submit suffrage amendments to voters, 47 campaigns to get constitutional conventions to write woman suffrage into state constitutions; 277 campaigns to get State party conventions to include woman suffrage planks, 30 campaigns to get presidential party campaigns to include woman suffrage planks in party platforms and 19 campaigns with 19 successive Congresses.

===Black women in 1920s===

Black women who had moved to northern cities could vote starting in 1920, and they played a new role in urban politics. In Chicago, the issue of black women voters was a competition between the middle-class women&#x27;s clubs, and the black preachers. Prominent women activists in Chicago included Ida B. Wells and Ada S. McKinley, Who attracted a national audience, as well as Ella Berry, Ida Dempsey and Jennie Lawrence. By 1930, blacks comprised upwards of 1/5 of the Republican vote, and had a growing role in primary elections. For example, the Colored Women&#x27;s Republican Club of Illinois Show their power in the 1928 primary, when their favorite Ruth Hanna McCormick outpolled former governor Charles S. Deneen three to one in the black wards and won the nomination for U.S. Senate. Year after year the white Republican leadership held out the hope of anti-lynching legislation, even though lynching had largely disappeared in most of the South by 1920, and in any case the votes were not there to pass it in Congress. Loyalty to the Republicans as the &quot;party of Lincoln&quot; persisted until the New Deal Coalition offered more opportunities for patronage and welfare in the mid-1930s. There was a class division as well, as the middle class black women reformers spoken language of utopian promise that did not ring true to the poor uneducated maids and laundry workers, who listened every Sunday to the promises of salvation from their preachers.

====Black women in business====

Most of the African-Americans in business were men, however women played a major role especially in the area of beauty. Standards of beauty were different for whites and blacks, and the black community developed its own standards, with an emphasis on hair care. Beauticians could work out of their own homes, and did not need storefronts. As a result, black beauticians were numerous in the rural South, despite the absence of cities and towns. They pioneered the use of cosmetics, at a time when rural white women in the South avoided them. As Blain Roberts has shown, beauticians offered their clients a space to feel pampered and beautiful in the context of their own community because, &quot;Inside black beauty shops, rituals of beautification converged with rituals of socialization.&quot; Beauty contests emerged in the 1920s, and in the white community they were linked to agricultural county fairs. By contrast in the black community, beauty contests were developed out of the homecoming ceremonies at their high schools and colleges. The most famous entrepreneur was Madame C.J. Walker (1867–1919); she built a national franchise business called Madame C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company based on her invention of the first successful hair straightening process.

===Feminism in 1920s===

The first wave of feminism petered out in the 1920s. After gaining suffrage, the political activities of women generally subsided or were absorbed in the main political parties. In the 1920s they paid special attention to such issues as world peace and child welfare.

The achievement of suffrage led to feminists refocusing their efforts towards other goals. Groups such as the National Women&#x27;s Party (NWP) continued the political fight.. Led by Alice Paul, the group proposing the Equal Rights Amendment in 1923 and working to remove laws that used sex to discriminate against women. But many women shifted their focus from politics to challenge traditional definitions of womanhood. Carrie Chapman Catt and others established The League of Women Voters to help women carry out their new responsibilities as voters.

====Roaring Twenties====

A generational gap began to form between the &quot;new&quot; women of the 1920s and older women. Prior to the 19th Amendment, feminists commonly thought that women could not pursue both a career and a family successfully, believing that one would inherently inhibit the development of the other. This mentality began to change in the 1920s as more women began to desire not only successful careers of their own but also families. The &quot;new&quot; woman was less invested in social service than the Progressive generations, and in tune with the capitalistic spirit of the era, she was eager to compete and to find personal fulfilment.

The 1920s saw significant change in the lives of working women. World War I had temporarily allowed women to enter into industries such as chemical, automobile, and iron and steel manufacturing, which were once deemed inappropriate work for women. Black women, who had been historically closed out of factory jobs, began to find a place in industry during World War I by accepting lower wages and replacing the lost immigrant labor and in heavy work. Yet, like other women during World War I, their success was only temporary; most black women were also pushed out of their factory jobs after the war. In 1920, seventy-five percent of the black female labor force consisted of agricultural laborers, domestic servants, and laundry workers. The booming economy of the 1920s meant more opportunities even for the lower classes. Many young girls from working-class backgrounds did not need to help support their families as prior generations did and were often encouraged to seek work or receive vocational training which would result in social mobility.

Young women, especially, began staking claim to their own bodies and took part in a sexual liberation of their generation. Many of the ideas that fueled this change in sexual thought were already floating around New York intellectual circles prior to World War I, with the writings of Sigmund Freud, Havelock Ellis, and Ellen Key. There, thinkers outed that sex was not only central to the human experience but that women were sexual beings with human impulses and desires just like men and restraining these impulses was self-destructive. By the 1920s, these ideas had permeated the mainstream.

The 1920s saw the emergence of the co-ed, as women began attending large state colleges and universities. Women entered into the mainstream middle-class experience, but took on a gendered role within society. Women typically took classes such as home economics, &quot;Husband and Wife&quot;, &quot;Motherhood&quot; and &quot;The Family as an Economic Unit&quot;. In an increasingly conservative post-war era, it was common for a young woman to attend college with the intention of finding a suitable husband. Fueled by ideas of sexual liberation, dating underwent major changes on college campuses. With the advent of the automobile, courtship occurred in a much more private setting. &quot;Petting&quot;, sexual relations without intercourse, became the social norm for college students.

Despite women&#x27;s increased knowledge of pleasure and sex, the decade of unfettered capitalism that was the 1920s gave birth to the &#x27;feminine mystique&#x27;. With this formulation, all women wanted to marry, all good women stayed at home with their children, cooking and cleaning, and the best women did the aforementioned and in addition, exercised their purchasing power freely and as frequently as possible in order to better their families and their homes.

====Flappers====
The &quot;new woman&quot; was in fashion throughout the twenties; this meant a woman who rejected the pieties (and often the politics) of the older generation, smoked and drank in public, had casual sex, and embraced consumer culture. Also called &quot;flappers&quot;, these women wore short skirts (at first just to the ankles, eventually up to the knees) and bobbed hair in a short cut – like a boy&#x27;s, but longer. Just as the flapper rejected the long hair popular in earlier years, she also discarded Victorian fashions, especially the corset, which accentuated women&#x27;s curves. Flappers preferred to be slender, although it sometimes meant dieting or binding their breasts and wearing restrictive undergarments to appear thin, flat-chested, and long-limbed. Cultivating a flapper image and adhering to modern beauty standards also involved purchasing and applying cosmetics, which had not often been done previously by women other than prostitutes. These women further pushed the boundaries of what was considered proper for a woman by their public activities; swearing, smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol (illegal from 1920 until 1933), dancing, and dating.

====Firsts====
Women achieved many groundbreaking firsts in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1921, Edith Wharton became the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, for her novel &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot;. In 1925, Nellie Tayloe Ross became the first woman elected as a governor in the United States, for the state of Wyoming. Also in 1925, the World Exposition of Women&#x27;s Progress (the first women&#x27;s world&#x27;s fair) opened in Chicago. In 1926, Gertrude Ederle, born in New York, became the first woman to swim across the English channel, arriving in almost two hours less time than any of the men who had swum across before her. In 1928, women competed for the first time in Olympic field events. By 1928, women earned 39% of all college degrees in America, up from 19% at the turn of the 20th century.

====Italian American resistance====
The American scene in the 1920s featured a widespread expansion of women&#x27;s roles, starting with the vote in 1920, and including new standards of education, employment and control of their own sexuality. &quot;Flappers&quot; raised the hemline and lowered the old restrictions in women&#x27;s fashion. The Italian-American media disapproved. It demanded the holding of the line regarding traditional gender roles in which men controlled their families. Many traditional patriarchal values prevailed among Southern European male immigrants, although some practices like dowry were left behind in Europe. The community spokesman Were shocked that the image of a woman with a secret ballot. They ridiculed flappers and proclaimed that feminism was immoral. They idealizes an old male model of Italian womanhood. Mussolini was popular, and when he expanded the electorate to include some women voting at the local level, the Italian American editorialists went along, arguing that the true Italian woman was, above all, a mother and a wife and, therefore, would be reliable as a voter on local matters. Feminist organizations in Italy were ignored, as the editors purposely associated emancipation with Americanism and transformed the debate over women&#x27;s rights into a defense of the Italian-American community to set its own boundaries and rules.

=== Great Depression of 1930s ===
In 1932, Hattie Caraway of Arkansas became the first woman elected to the Senate. Furthermore, in 1932 Amelia Earhart became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic, taking her journey on the 5th anniversary of Lindbergh&#x27;s solo Atlantic flight . She was awarded the National Geographic Society&#x27;s gold medal from President Herbert Hoover, and Congress awarded her the Distinguished Flying Cross. Later in 1932 she became the first woman to fly solo nonstop coast to coast, and set the women&#x27;s nonstop transcontinental speed record, flying 2,447.8 miles in 19 hours 5 minutes. In 1935, she became the first person to solo the 2,408-mile distance across the Pacific between Honolulu and Oakland, California; this was also the first flight where a civilian aircraft carried a two-way radio. Later in 1935, she became the first person to fly solo from Los Angeles to Mexico City. Still later in 1935, she became the first person to fly solo nonstop from Mexico City to Newark. In 1937, Amelia Earhart began a flight around the world but vanished during it; her remains, effects, and plane have never been found. The first woman to fly solo around the world and return home safely was the American amateur pilot Jerrie Mock, who did so in 1964. In 1933, Frances Perkins was appointed by President Franklin Roosevelt as his Secretary of Labor, making her the first woman to hold a job in a Presidential cabinet.

However, women also faced many challenges during this time. A National Education Association survey showed that between 1930 and 1931, 63% of cities dismissed female teachers as soon as they became married, and 77% did not hire married women as teachers. Also, a survey of 1,500 cities from 1930 to 1931 found that three-quarters of those cities did not employ married women for any jobs. In January 1932, Congress passed the Federal Economy Act which stipulated that no two persons in the family could be working in government service at the same time; three-fourths of employees discharged as a result of this Act were women. However, during the Great Depression white women&#x27;s unemployment rate was actually lower than that for men, because women were paid less and because men would not take what they considered to be &quot;women&#x27;s jobs&quot; such as clerical work or domestic service. Yet as a result of rising unemployment, white women&#x27;s movement into professional and technical work slowed.

Birth control activism was an important cause in the 1930s. In 1936, Margaret Sanger helped bring the case of &quot;United States v. One Package&quot; to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The decision in that case allowed physicians to legally mail birth control devices and information; however, it applied only to New York, Connecticut, and Vermont; birth control did not become legal for married couples throughout the United States until the 1965 Supreme Court decision &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot;, and did not become legal for unmarried couples throughout the United States until the 1972 Supreme Court decision &quot;Eisenstadt v. Baird&quot;. In 1937, The American Medical Association officially recognized birth control as an integral part of medical practice and education, and North Carolina became the first state to recognize birth control as a public health measure and to provide contraceptive services to indigent mothers through its public health program.

In 1939, black singer Marian Anderson sang on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, which was considered a milestone in the civil rights movement. She had originally wanted to sing at Washington D.C.&#x27;s largest venue, Constitution Hall, but The Daughters of the American Revolution barred her from performing there because of her race. Due to this, Eleanor Roosevelt, who was then the First Lady, resigned from the organization. This stands as one of the first actions taken by someone in the White House to address the era&#x27;s racial inequality. Anderson performed at the White House three years prior in 1936, making her the first African-American performer to do so.

===New Deal===
Women received symbolic recognition under the New Deal (1933–43) but there was no effort to deal with their special needs. In relief programs, they were eligible for jobs only if they were the breadwinner in the family. Nevertheless, relief agencies did find jobs for women. The WPA employed about 500,000. The largest number, 295,000, worked on sewing projects, producing 300 million items of clothing and mattresses for people on relief and for public institutions such as orphanages. Many other women worked in school lunch programs.

Roosevelt appointed more women to office than any previous president, headed by the first woman to the cabinet, Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins. His wife Eleanor played a highly visible role in support of relief programs. In 1941, Eleanor became co-head of the Office of Civil Defense, the major civil defense agency. She tried to involve women at the local level, but she feuded with her counterpart Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, and had little impact on policy. Historian Alan Brinkley states:
:Nor did the New Deal make much more than a symbolic effort to address problems of gender equality...New Deal programs (even those designed by New Deal women) continued most mostly to reflect traditional assumptions about women&#x27;s roles and made few gestures toward the aspirations of women who sought economic independence and professional opportunities. The interest in individual and group rights that became so central to the postwar liberalism... was faint, and at times almost invisible, within the New Deal itself.

==Since 1941==
=== World War II ===


When the United States entered World War II in 1941, 12 million women were already working (making up one quarter of the workforce), and by the end of the war, the number was up to 18 million (one third of the workforce). Eventually 3 million women worked in war plants, but the majority of women who worked during World War II worked in traditionally female occupations, like the service sector. During this time, Government propaganda calling on women to enter the workforce during the emergency popularized the &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot; image of women assuming male roles.

Standlee (2010) argues that during the war the traditional gender division of labor changed somewhat, as the &quot;home&quot; or domestic female sphere expanded to include the &quot;home front&quot;. Meanwhile, the public sphere—the male domain—was redefined as the international stage of military action.

====Employment====
Wartime mobilization drastically changed the sexual divisions of labor for women, as young-able bodied men were sent overseas and war time manufacturing production increased. Throughout the war, according to Susan Hartmann (1982), an estimated 6.5 million women entered the labor force. Women, many of whom were married, took a variety of paid jobs in a multitude of vocational jobs, many of which were previously exclusive to men. The greatest wartime gain in female employment was in the manufacturing industry, where more than 2.5 million additional women represented an increase of 140 percent by 1944. This was catalyzed by the &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot; phenomenon.

The composition of the marital status of women who went to work changed considerably over the course of the war. One in every ten married women entered the labor force during the war, and they represented more than three million of the new female workers, while 2.89 million were single and the rest widowed or divorced. For the first time in the nation&#x27;s history there were more married women than single women in the female labor force. In 1944, thirty-seven percent of all adult women were reported in the labor force, but nearly fifty percent of all women were actually employed at some time during that year at the height of wartime production. In the same year the unemployment rate hit an all-time historical low of 1.2%.

According to Hartmann (1982), the women who sought employment, based on various surveys and public opinion reports at the time suggests that financial reasoning was the justification for entering the labor force; however, patriotic motives made up another large portion of women&#x27;s desires to enter. Women whose husbands were at war were more than twice as likely to seek jobs.

Fundamentally, women were thought to be taking work defined as &quot;men&#x27;s work;&quot; however, the work women did was typically catered to specific skill sets management thought women could handle. Management would also advertise women&#x27;s work as an extension of domesticity. For example, in a Sperry Corporation recruitment pamphlet the company stated, &quot;Note the similarity between squeezing orange juice and the operation of a small drill press.&quot; A Ford Motor Company at Willow Run bomber plant publication proclaimed, &quot;The ladies have shown they can operate drill presses as well as egg beaters.&quot; One manager was even stated saying, &quot;Why should men, who from childhood on never so much as sewed on buttons be expected to handle delicate instruments better than women who have plied embroidery needles, knitting needles and darning needs all their lives?&quot; In these instances, women were thought of and hired to do jobs management thought they could perform based on sex-typing.

Following the war, many women left their jobs voluntarily. One Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant (formally Twin Cities Ordnance Plant) worker in New Brighton, Minnesota confessed, &quot;I will gladly get back into the apron. I did not go into war work with the idea of working all my life. It was just to help out during the war.&quot; Other women were laid off by employers to make way for returning veterans who did not lose their seniority due to the war.

By the end of the war, many men who entered into the service did not return. This left women to take up sole responsibility of the household and provide economically for the family.

====Black women====
Before the war most black women had been farm laborers in the South or domestics in Southern towns or Northern cities. Working with the federal Fair Employment Practices Committee, the NAACP, and CIO unions, these black women fought a &quot;Double V campaign&quot; —fighting against the Axis abroad and against restrictive hiring practices at home. Their efforts redefined citizenship, equating their patriotism with war work, and seeking equal employment opportunities, government entitlements, and better working conditions as conditions appropriate for full citizens. In the South, black women worked in segregated jobs; in the West and most of the North, they were integrated. However, wildcat strikes erupted in Detroit, Baltimore, and Evansville, Indiana where white migrants from the South refused to work alongside black women.

===Nursing===

Nursing became a highly prestigious occupation for young women. A majority of female civilian nurses volunteered for the Army Nurse Corps or the Navy Nurse Corps. These women automatically became officers. Teenaged girls enlisted in the Cadet Nurse Corps. To cope with the growing shortage on the homefront, thousands of retired nurses volunteered to help out in local hospitals.

===Volunteer activities===
Women staffed millions of jobs in community service roles, such as nursing, the USO, and the Red Cross. Unorganized women were encouraged to collect and turn in materials that were needed by the war effort. Women collected fats rendered during cooking, children formed balls of aluminum foil they peeled from chewing gum wrappers and also created rubber band balls, which they contributed to the war effort. Hundreds of thousands of men joined civil defense units to prepare for disasters, such as enemy bombing.

The Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) mobilized 1,000 civilian women to fly new warplanes from the factories to airfields located on the east coast of the U.S. This was historically significant because flying a warplane had always been a male role. No American women flew warplanes in combat.

===Baby boom===
Marriage and motherhood came back as prosperity empowered couples who had postponed marriage. The birth rate started shooting up in 1941, paused in 1944–45 as 12 million men were in uniform, then continued to soar until reaching a peak in the late 1950s. This was the &quot;Baby Boom.&quot;

In a New Deal-like move, the federal government set up the &quot;EMIC&quot; program that provided free prenatal and natal care for the wives of servicemen below the rank of sergeant.

Housing shortages, especially in the munitions centers, forced millions of couples to live with parents or in makeshift facilities. Little housing had been built in the Depression years, so the shortages grew steadily worse until about 1949, when a massive housing boom finally caught up with demand. (After 1944, much of the new housing was supported by the G.I. Bill.)

Federal law made it difficult to divorce absent servicemen, so the number of divorces peaked when they returned in 1946. In long-range terms, divorce rates changed little.

===Housewives===
Juggling their roles as mothers due to the Baby Boom and the jobs they filled while the men were at war, women strained to complete all tasks set before them. The war caused cutbacks in automobile and bus service, and migration from farms and towns to munitions centers. Those housewives who worked found the dual role difficult to handle.

Stress came when sons, husbands, fathers, brothers, and fiancés were drafted and sent to faraway training camps, preparing for a war in which nobody knew how many would be killed. Millions of wives tried to relocate near their husbands&#x27; training camps.

At the end of the war, most of the munitions-making jobs ended. Many factories were closed; others retooled for civilian production. In some jobs women were replaced by returning veterans who did not lose seniority because they were in service. However the number of women at work in 1946 was 87% of the number in 1944, leaving 13% who lost or quit their jobs. Many women working in machinery factories and more were taken out of the work force. Many of these former factory workers found other work at kitchens, being teachers, etc.

===Military service===
Furthermore, during World War II 350,000 women served in the military, as WACS, WAVES, SPARS, Marines and nurses. More than 60,000 Army nurses served stateside and overseas during World War II; 67 Army nurses were captured by the Japanese in the Philippines in 1942 and were held as POWs for over two and a half years. More than 14,000 Navy nurses served stateside, overseas on hospital ships, and as flight nurses during the war. Five Navy nurses were captured by the Japanese on the island of Guam and held as POWs for five months before being exchanged; a second group of eleven Navy nurses were captured by the Japanese in the Philippines and held for 37 months.

Over 150,000 American women served in the Women&#x27;s Army Corps (WAC) during World War II; the Corps was formed in 1942. Many Army WACs computed the velocity of bullets, measured bomb fragments, mixed gunpowder, and loaded shells. Others worked as draftswomen, mechanics, and electricians, and some received training in ordnance engineering. Later in the war, women were trained to replace men as radio operators on U.S. Army hospital ships. The &quot;Larkspur&quot;, the &quot;Charles A. Stafford&quot;, and the &quot;Blanche F. Sigman&quot; each received three enlisted women and one officer near the end of 1944. This experiment proved successful, and the assignment of female secretaries and clerical workers to hospital ships occurred soon after.

Eventually the Air Force obtained 40% of all WACs in the Army; women were assigned as weather observers and forecasters, cryptographers, radio operators and repairmen, sheet metal workers, parachute riggers, link trainer instructors, bombsight maintenance specialists, aerial photograph analysts, and control tower operators. Over 1,000 WACs ran the statistical control tabulating machines (the precursors of modern-day computers) used to keep track of personnel records. By January 1945 only 50% of AAF WACs held traditional assignments such as file clerk, typist, and stenographer. A few Air Force WACs were assigned flying duties; two WAC radio operators assigned to Mitchel Field, New York, flew as crew members on B-17 training flights. WAC mechanics and photographers also made regular flights. Three WACs were awarded Air Medals, including one in India for her work in mapping &quot;the Hump,&quot; the mountainous air route overflown by pilots ferrying lend-lease supplies to the Chinese Army. One woman died in the crash of an aerial broadcasting plane.

In 1942, the WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service) division was founded as an all-female division of the Navy, and more than 80,000 women served in it, including computer scientist Grace Hopper, who later achieved the rank of rear admiral. While traditionally female secretarial and clerical jobs took a large portion of the WAVES women, thousands of WAVES performed previously atypical duties in the aviation community, Judge Advocate General Corps, medical professions, communications, intelligence, science and technology. The WAVES ended and women were accepted into the regular Navy in 1948. The first six enlisted women to be sworn into the regular Navy on July 7, 1948 were Kay Langdon, Wilma Marchal, Edna Young, Frances Devaney, Doris Robertson. and Ruth Flora. On October 15, 1948, the first eight women to be commissioned in the regular Navy, Joy Bright Hancock, Winifred Quick Collins, Ann King, Frances Willoughby, Ellen Ford, Doris Cranmore, Doris Defenderfer, and Betty Rae Tennant took their oaths as naval officers.

Semper Paratus Always Ready, better known as SPARS, was the United States Coast Guard Women&#x27;s Reserve, created November 23, 1942; more than 11,000 women served in SPARS during World War II. SPARs were assigned stateside and served as storekeepers, clerks, photographers, pharmacist&#x27;s mates, cooks, and in numerous other jobs. The program was largely
demobilized after the war.

The Marine Corps created a Women&#x27;s Reserve in 1943; women served as Marines during the war in over 225 different specialties, filling 85% of the enlisted jobs at Headquarters Marine Corps and comprising one-half to two-thirds of the permanent personnel at major Marine Corps posts. Marine women served stateside as clerks, cooks, mechanics, drivers, and in a variety of other positions.

The Women&#x27;s Airforce Service Pilots (also known as WASP) was a civilian agency that had uniforms but no military status. It was created in 1943 to free male pilots for combat service. WASPs flew stateside missions as ferriers, test pilots, and anti-aircraft artillery trainers. Some 25,000 women applied to join the WASP, but only 1,830 were accepted and took the oath, and out of those only 1,074 women passed the training and joined. The WASPs flew over 60 million miles in all, in every type of aircraft in the AAF arsenal.

WASPs were granted veteran status in 1977, and given the Congressional Gold Medal in 2009.

Some women were spies for America during World War II, for example the singer Josephine Baker, whose long residency in France helped her form an underground network, and Claire Phillips, a spy in the Philippines (then occupied by Japan) who in addition to spying sent aid and supplies to the American POWs; Claire was tortured, but never admitted to knowing the people in her spy ring, and after the war she was recognized by the American and Philippine governments for her heroism.

===Postwar===

Once World War II ended in 1945, female munitions workers were expected to give up their jobs to returning male veterans and go back home to have, and care for children put off by the war. In 1946, 4,000,000 women were fired from their jobs. But for many women, work was an economic necessity, and they simply went back to the sort of low-paying jobs they had held before the war. However, most people in the 1950s felt that ideally women should be homemakers and men should be breadwinners. A booming economy helped to make this possible; by the mid-1950s, 40% of Americans were living in the suburbs with, on average, 3.8 children, two cars and two television sets. This lifestyle affected the aspirations of housewives and mothers: only 38% of women went to college in 1958 compared to 47% in 1920, despite the availability of more federal aid to pay for university education in the post-war America. Furthermore, although 46% of women worked during the 1950s, 75% of them worked in simple clerical or sales jobs. The average working woman in the 1950s earned 60% of the average working man&#x27;s salary.

However, there were still advances for women in the military. The Army-Navy Nurse Act of 1947 made the Army Nurse Corps and Women&#x27;s Medical Specialist Corps part of the regular Army and gave permanent commissioned officer status to Army and Navy nurses. In 1948, Congress passed the Women&#x27;s Armed Forces Integration Act, which authorized women to enlist in the military alongside men, rather than in their own separate units, although women were still not allowed to serve in combat. Furthermore, in 1948 Executive Order 9981 ended racial segregation in the armed services. In 1949, the Air Force Nurse Corps was established (the Air Force itself was created in 1947). That same year, the first African-American women enlisted in the Marine Corps.

The Korean War was fought from 1950 to 1953. Many servicewomen who had joined the Reserves following World War II were involuntarily recalled to active duty during the Korean War. 540 Army nurses (all military nurses during the Korean War were female) served in the combat zone and many more were assigned to large hospitals in Japan during the war. One Army nurse (Genevieve Smith) died in a plane crash en route to Korea on July 27, 1950, shortly after hostilities began. Navy nurses served on hospital ships in the Korean theater of war as well as at Navy hospitals stateside. Eleven Navy nurses died en route to Korea when their plane crashed in the Marshall Islands. Air Force nurses served stateside, in Japan and as flight nurses in the Korean theater during the war. Three Air Force nurses were killed in plane crashes while on duty. Many other servicewomen were assigned to duty in the theater of operations in Japan and Okinawa.

===Civil rights===
Women were heavily involved in lesbian rights and civil rights throughout the 1950s. The 1954 case &quot;Oliver Brown et al. v. The Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas&quot; was named after Oliver Brown as a legal strategy to have a man at the head of the roster, although the 13 plaintiffs included 12 women and only one man: Oliver Brown, Darlene Brown, Lena Carper, Sadie Emmanuel, Marguerite Emerson, Shirley Fleming, Zelma Henderson, Shirley Hodison, Maude Lawton, Alma Lewis, Iona Richardson, and Lucinda Todd. In 1955, the first national lesbian political and social organization in the United States, called Daughters of Bilitis, was founded by four lesbian couples in San Francisco (including Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon). On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, a seamstress and volunteer secretary for the NAACP, was arrested in Montgomery, Alabama for refusing to give up her seat on a bus to a white man, as required by law at the time; shortly after this a bus boycott began, inspired by her actions, advocating for an end to all segregated busing. The night of Rosa Parks&#x27; arrest, with her permission, Mrs. Jo Ann Robinson stayed up mimeographing 35,000 handbills calling for a boycott of the Montgomery bus system. Prior to Rosa Parks&#x27; action, Claudette Colvin and Mary Louise Smith had refused to give up their seats on buses to white women, but their cases were eventually rejected by civil rights lawyers as they were not considered sympathetic enough. Aurelia Shines Browder refused to give up her seat to a white man in Montgomery, Alabama in April 1955, and she filed suit against the city and its Democrat Mayor W.A. &quot;Tacky&quot; Gayle. It was on her case, known as &quot;Browder v Gayle&quot;, that the Supreme Court ruled in 1956 that segregated busing was unconstitutional, thus ending the bus boycott. Aurelia Browder was the lead plaintiff in the case, and Susie McDonald, Claudette Colvin, and Mary Louise Smith were the other plaintiffs. In the 1960s, legal scholar Pauli Murray coined the term &quot;Jane Crow&quot; to highlight racial inequality experienced by women of color.

===Status of women===

Yet women still occupied a lower position than men in many sectors of American life. In 1957, the National Manpower Council (NMC) at Columbia University published its study, &quot;Womanpower, A Statement by the National Manpower Council with Chapters by the Council Staff&quot;. It was a comprehensive look at the experience of women in the labor force, their employment needs, and the implications of both for education, training, and public policy. This NMC analysis called women &quot;essential&quot; and &quot;distinctive&quot; workers and recommended that the Secretary of Labor establish a committee to review &quot;the consequences and adequacy of existing Federal and state laws which have a direct bearing on the employment of women.&quot; But this suggestion was not acted upon by the Eisenhower Administration. In 1959, three landmark books on women were published: &quot;A Century of Struggle&quot; by Eleanor Flexner, the first professional history of the 19th century women&#x27;s movement, which contained an implicit call to arms; &quot;A Century of Higher Education for American Women&quot; by Mabel Newcomer, which disclosed that the relative position of women in the academic world was in decline; and &quot;Women and Work in America&quot; by Robert Smuts, which drew attention to the fact that &quot;the picture of women&#x27;s occupations outside the home between 1890 and 1950 had changed in only a few essentials.&quot;

In reaction to such findings, by 1961, President John F. Kennedy was under pressure to establish a President&#x27;s Commission on the Status of Women. Esther Peterson, Assistant Secretary of Labor and director of the Women&#x27;s Bureau, and the highest ranking woman in the Kennedy Administration, wanted such a commission. Along with equal pay legislation, it had long been on the agenda of labor movement women and it was in that movement that Peterson&#x27;s working career had been concentrated. Another wish of the women&#x27;s movement, effective birth control, came true as in 1961 the first birth control pill, called Enovid, received FDA approval and went on the market. Women&#x27;s organizations, notably the American Association of University Women and Business and Professional Women, had been proposing a women&#x27;s rights commission for many years; they found a champion in Eleanor Roosevelt, who backed the proposal when she met with Kennedy at the White House after his election. The establishment of the Commission may also have been regarded by Kennedy as an expedient way to pay off his political debts to the women who had supported his campaign but were disappointed with his poor record of appointments of women to his administration. There was also a desire to have Eleanor Roosevelt, one of the most respected women in the country, associated with the Kennedy Administration. Roosevelt had only reluctantly supported JFK&#x27;s presidential candidacy after her first choice, Adlai Stevenson, lost the nomination. However, she agreed to be the Chairperson of the President&#x27;s Commission on the Status of Women, which was held from 1961 until 1963.
The Commission&#x27;s Report, called &quot;The American Woman&quot; and issued in 1963, noted discrimination against women in the areas of education, home and community services, employment, social insurance and taxation, and legal, civil and political rights. The report also recommended continued network-building. President Kennedy implemented two Commission recommendations that established an Interdepartmental Committee on the Status of Women and a Citizens&#x27; Advisory Council on the Status of Women, composed of twenty private citizens appointed by the President. These two groups co-sponsored four national conferences of state commissions on the status of women. Another important event of 1963 was the publication of Betty Friedan&#x27;s influential book &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;, which is often cited as the founding moment of second-wave feminism. This book highlighted Friedan&#x27;s view of a coercive and pervasive post-World War-II ideology of female domesticity that stifled middle-class women&#x27;s opportunities to be anything but homemakers. Friedan&#x27;s book is credited with sparking second-wave feminism by directing women&#x27;s attention to the broad social basis of their problems, stirring many to political and social activism.

Also in 1963, President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act of 1963 into law, which amended the Fair Labor Standards Act to prohibit pay discrimination because of sex. It requires the employer to pay equal wages to men and women doing equal work on jobs requiring equal skill, effort, and responsibility, which are performed under similar working conditions. However, it did not originally cover executives, administrators, outside salespeople, or professionals. In 1972, Congress enacted the Education Amendments of 1972, which (among other things) amended the Fair Labor Standards Act to expand the coverage of the Equal Pay Act to these employees, by excluding the Equal Pay Act from the professional workers exemption of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Another accomplishment for feminism in 1963 was that feminist activist Gloria Steinem published her article &quot;I Was a Playboy Bunny&quot;, a behind the scenes look at the sexist treatment of Playboy bunnies, which was one of her first major assignments in investigative journalism.

There were several political firsts for women in the 1960s. On November 22, 1963, following the assassination of President Kennedy, federal judge Sarah T. Hughes administered the Presidential Oath of Office to Lyndon Johnson aboard Air Force One, the only time a woman has done so, as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court normally has this honor. 1964 was the first year in which more women voted in a Presidential election than men; more women have voted than men in every Presidential election since.

One of the most important advances for women&#x27;s rights in this decade was not begun by a feminist. On Saturday, February 8, 1964, while the Civil Rights Act was being debated on the House floor, Howard W. Smith of Virginia, Chairman of the Rules Committee and staunch opponent of all civil rights legislation, rose up and offered a one word amendment to Title VII, which prohibited employment discrimination. He proposed to add &quot;sex&quot; to that one title of the bill in order &quot;to prevent discrimination against another minority group, the women,&quot;... (110 Cong. Rec., February 8, 1964, 2577). This stimulated several hours of humorous debate, later called &quot;ladies day in the House&quot;, before the amendment was passed by a teller vote of
168 to 133. The &quot;Congressional Record&quot; shows Smith made serious arguments, voicing concerns that white women would suffer greater discrimination without a protection for gender. Liberals—who knew Smith was hostile to civil rights for blacks—assumed that he was hostile to rights for women, unaware of his long connection with white feminists.
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in charge of the enforcement of Title VII, ignored sex discrimination complaints, and the prohibition against sex discrimination in employment went unenforced for the next few years. One EEOC director called the prohibition &quot;a fluke...conceived out of wedlock,&quot; and even the liberal magazine &quot;The New Republic&quot; asked, &quot;Why should a mischievous joke perpetrated on the floor of the House of Representatives be treated by a responsible administration body with this kind of seriousness?&quot;

1965 saw the Supreme Court case &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot;, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), a landmark case in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the Constitution protected a right to privacy. The case involved Estelle Griswold acting against a Connecticut &quot;Comstock law&quot; that prohibited any person from using &quot;any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception.&quot; By a vote of 7–2, the Supreme Court invalidated the law on the grounds that it violated the &quot;right to marital privacy&quot;, establishing the basis for the right to privacy with respect to intimate practices.

In 1966, at the third National Conference of State Commissions on the Status of Women, the conference organizers did not allow resolutions or actions of any kind meant to abolish discrimination against women, so some women who were attending decided to form an advocacy organization of their own. Cornering a large table at the conference luncheon, so that they could start organizing before they had to rush for planes, each of those women chipped in five dollars, Betty Friedan wrote the acronym NOW on a napkin, and the National Organization for Women was created. Its first meeting was held on June 28, 1966 in Betty Friedan&#x27;s hotel room, with 28 women attending. At its first conference in October 1966, Friedan was elected NOW&#x27;s first president, and her fame as the author of the bestselling book &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; helped attract thousands of women to the organization. Friedan drafted NOW&#x27;s original Statement of Purpose, which began, &quot;The purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.&quot; Furthermore, in 1966, Congresswoman Martha Griffiths admonished the EEOC on the floor of Congress for their failure to enforce the prohibition against sex discrimination in employment.

Employment discrimination against women began to be taken more seriously in the late 1960s. In 1967, President Lyndon Johnson issued Executive Order 11375, which declared that federal employers must take affirmative action to ensure that employees receive equal treatment and opportunities regardless of gender, race, color, or religion. In 1968, the EEOC, following two years of protests by NOW, banned all help wanted ads which specified which sex a job applicant should be, except those jobs for which being a certain sex was a bona fide occupational requirement (such as actress), opening many hitherto unattainable jobs to women. The Supreme Court ruled the ban legal in &quot;Pittsburgh Press Co. v Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations&quot;, 413 U.S. 376 (1973).

===Late 1960s===
There were several other feminist advances in the late 1960s, in both conservative and liberal circles. In 1968, conservative women separated from NOW and organized Women&#x27;s Equity Action League (WEAL) to campaign for equal opportunities for women in education, economics, and employment, while avoiding issues such as abortion, sexuality, and the Equal Rights Amendment. Also in 1968, there was a protest of the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City; at the protest a group of about one hundred women tossed items that they considered symbolic of women&#x27;s oppression into a Freedom Trash Can, including copies of Playboy, high-heeled shoes, corsets, and girdles. They also crowned a sheep as Miss America. Lindsy Van Gelder, a reporter for the Post, wrote a piece about the protest in which she compared the trash-can procession to the burning of draft cards at antiwar marches. However, the rumor that women burned their bras at the protest is not true.

===1970s===
Litigation for women&#x27;s rights now began to have a serious impact on American life. In 1970, California adopted the nation&#x27;s first no-fault divorce law, which was intended to promote equality between men and women. By 2010, all 50 states had legalized no-fault divorce, with New York being the last state to do so. In 1969, the case &quot;Weeks v Southern Bell&quot; was decided in favor of Lorena Weeks, who had applied for a better job as a switchperson, but had her application rejected because, her union boss said, &quot;the man is the breadwinner in the family, and women just do not need this type of job.&quot; Weeks filed a complaint with the EEOC, but the phone company cited a Georgia law that prohibited women from lifting anything heavier than 30 pounds, although the 34-pound manual typewriter Weeks used as a clerk had to be lifted by hand onto her desk every morning and stored away every night. After the case was decided, she received $31,000 in back pay and got the job. In the 1971 Supreme Court case &quot;Reed v Reed&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that it is illegal for any state to prefer all men over all women as administrators of assets. This was the first time in history that the Supreme Court ruled that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution applied to differential treatment based on legal sex.

In addition to litigation, feminist activists also began to form their own institutions to propagate their ideals. In 1971, feminists including Rep. Bella Abzug, Betty Friedan, and Gloria Steinem founded the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus to advocate for more women and feminists in elective office. Also in 1971, Gloria Steinem and others began publishing &quot;Ms.&quot;, the first national American feminist magazine.

The first three hundred thousand copies of &quot;Ms.&quot; sold out in eight days; the magazine name comes from the fact that the title Ms. was originally popularized by feminists in the 1970s to replace Miss and Mrs. and provide a parallel term to Mr., in that both Ms. and Mr. designate gender without indicating marital status.

In 1972, former NOW members Pat Goltz and Cathy Callaghan founded Feminists for Life, with the goal of eliminating the root causes that they felt drove women to abortion, contending that abortion violated core feminist principles of justice, non-discrimination and nonviolence.

1972 also saw the Supreme Court case &quot;Eisenstadt v. Baird&quot;, 405 U.S. 438 (1972), that established the right of unmarried people to possess contraception on the same basis as married couples and, by implication, the right of unmarried couples to engage in potentially nonprocreative sexual intercourse (though not the right of unmarried people to engage in any type of sexual intercourse). The Court struck down a Massachusetts law prohibiting the distribution of contraceptives to unmarried people, ruling that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.

One of the most important feminist successes of the early 1970s was when Nixon signed into law the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. The Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 gives the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) authority to sue in federal courts when it finds reasonable cause to believe that there has been employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. In the case of public employment, the EEOC refers the matter to the United States Attorney General to bring the lawsuit. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 requires gender equity in every educational program that receives federal funding including but not limited to sports.

However, the feminist movement did have some notable setbacks around this time. In 1972, President Nixon vetoed the Comprehensive Child Development Bill of 1972, which many feminists advocated and which would have established both early-education programs and after-school care across the country, with tuition on a sliding scale based on a family&#x27;s income bracket, and the program available to everyone but participation required of no one.

====Defeat of the Equal Rights Amendment====
Pro-ERA advocacy was led by the National Organization for Women (NOW) and ERAmerica, a coalition of nearly 80 other organizations. The Equal Rights Amendment passed the Senate and then the House of Representatives in 1972, and on March 22, 1972, it was sent to the states for ratification. However, it was not ratified before the deadline for ratification passed, and therefore never became law. Some states&#x27;-rights advocates thought the ERA was a federal power grab. Some feminists claimed that the insurance industry opposed a measure they believed would cost them money. Opposition to the ERA was also organized by fundamentalist religious groups. 
The most influential ERA opponent was Phyllis Schlafly, right-wing leader of the Eagle Forum/STOP ERA. She argues that the ERA would deny a woman&#x27;s right to be supported by her husband, privacy rights would be overturned, women would be sent into combat, and abortion rights and same-sex marriages would be upheld.
Experts agree that Schlafly&#x27;s organization skills were decisive in causing the defeat. Political scientist Jane Mansbridge in her history of the ERA concludes: 
:Many people who followed the struggle over the ERA believed—rightly in my view—that the Amendment would have been ratified by 1975 or 1976 had it not been for Phyllis Schlafly&#x27;s early and effective effort to organize potential opponents.
Joan C. Williams argues, &quot;ERA was defeated when Schlafly turned it into a war among women over gender roles.&quot; Historian Judith Glazer-Raymo argues:
:As moderates, we thought we represented the forces of reason and goodwill but failed to take seriously the power of the family values argument and the single-mindedness of Schlafly and her followers. The ERA&#x27;s defeat seriously damaged the women&#x27;s movement, destroying its momentum and its potential to foment social change...Eventually, this resulted in feminist dissatisfaction with the Republican Party, giving the Democrats a new source of strength that when combined with overwhelming minority support, helped elect Bill Clinton to the presidency in 1992 and again in 1996.

===The radical feminist movement===
Second-wave feminism was diverse in its causes and goals. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, parallel with the counterculture movements, women with more radical ideas about feminist goals began to organize. In her work, &quot;Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967–1975&quot;, historian Alice Echols gives a thorough description of the short-lived movement. The radical feminists were after not only the end of female oppression by men but, as Echols notes, &quot;They also fought for safe, effective, accessible contraception; the repeal of all abortion laws; the creation of high-quality, community-controlled child-care centers; and an end to the media&#x27;s objectification of women. &quot;

Small protests and signs of a larger support for radical feminism became more cohesive during the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) June 1967 National Convention in Ann Arbor. The &quot;Women&#x27;s Liberation Workshop&quot; denounced sexual inequality and stated, &quot;As we analyze the position of women in capitalist society and especially the United States we find that women are in a colonial relationship to men and we recognize ourselves as part of the Third World.&quot; Co-written by Jane Addams, one of the most prominent women in SDS, they argued that women&#x27;s place within SDS was subordinate and revolution could not succeed without women&#x27;s liberation.

SDS women, including Susan Stern of the Weathermen, and women from the Old Left, including Clara Fraser and Gloria Martin, came together to found Radical Women in Seattle in November 1967. Radical Women identified as socialist feminist and described its political views in &quot;The Radical Women Manifesto.&quot; The group called for multi-issue struggle around issues of sex, race and class and defended lesbian/gay rights. Radical Women celebrated its 50th anniversary of activism in 2017. (There is no relationship between Radical Women and the short-lived group known as New York Radical Women.)

While radical feminists agreed that a separate movement for them was needed, how that movement looked and its ultimate goals caused much divide. They questioned whether they should include men within their movement, whether they should focus on issues of war, race and class, and who or what it was they were exactly rallying against. There were also issues concerning African American women within the movement; while the radical feminists felt gender to be the greatest issue, African American women were also very much concerned with racism and many found that to be where oppression was most domineering. Despite being inspired by the black power movement, radical feminists had difficulty figuring out a place for race within their gender-centric movement. They were also divided over the place of lesbianism in the movement.

Notable radical feminist groups included Redstockings, founded in 1969. The group focused on power dynamics in gender and promoted consciousness-raising and distributed movement literature for free. Cell 16, founded in 1968, was a much more militant group arguing that women were conditioned by their sex-roles. The Feminists, founded by Ti-Grace Atkinson in 1968, claimed women were complicit in their oppression and needed to shed conventional gender roles. New York Radical Feminists, founded in 1969, also found maleness to be the greater issue than power roles. They were interested in building a larger movement through mass numbers in New York City.

Echols describes the movement&#x27;s end: 
&quot;Radical feminism remained the hegemonic tendency within the women&#x27;s liberation movement until 1973 when cultural feminism began to cohere and challenge its dominance. After 1975, a year of internecine conflicts between radical and cultural feminists, cultural feminism eclipsed radical feminism as the dominant tendency within the women&#x27;s liberation movement, and, as a consequence, liberal feminism became the recognized voice of the women&#x27;s movement.&quot;
The end of the counterculture movements and the government&#x27;s observation of the movement also contributed to its end. The radical feminist movement demonstrated that Second-wave feminism was diverse in its goals, but also divided within itself. Echols notes, &quot;To many women, liberal feminism&#x27;s considerably more modest goal of bringing women into the mainstream seemed more palatable, not to mention more realistic, than the radical feminist project of fundamentally reconstructing private and public life.&quot; She also states that despite the fact that younger generations does not often see this movement as relevant, it is because feminist movements during this time actually did make significant changes.

===Abortion===
One of the most controversial developments in American women&#x27;s lives has been the legalization of abortion. In 1973, in the Supreme Court case &quot;Roe v Wade&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that it is an illegal violation of privacy to outlaw or regulate any aspect of abortion performed during the first trimester of pregnancy, and that government can only enact abortion regulations reasonably related to maternal health in the second and third trimesters, and can enact abortion laws protecting the life of the fetus only in the third trimester. Furthermore, even in the third trimester, an exception has to be made to protect the life of the mother. This ruling has been extremely controversial from the moment it was made. Linda Coffee and Sarah Weddington had brought the lawsuit that led to &quot;Roe v Wade&quot; on behalf of a pregnant woman, Dallas area resident Norma L. McCorvey (&quot;Jane Roe&quot;), claiming a Texas law criminalizing most abortions violated Roe&#x27;s constitutional rights. The Texas law banned all abortions except those necessary to save the life of the mother, and Roe claimed that while her life was not endangered, she could not afford to travel out of state and had a right to terminate her pregnancy in a safe medical environment.

===Firsts===
One of the most famous feminist media events, aside from the 1968 Miss America protest, was the tennis match known as the &quot;Battle of the Sexes.&quot; In this match, on September 20, 1973, in Houston, Texas, women&#x27;s tennis champion Billie Jean King defeated Bobby Riggs 6–4, 6–3, 6–3, before a worldwide television audience estimated at almost 50 million. 55-year-old former tennis champion Bobby Riggs had defeated Australian tennis player Margaret Court earlier that year, and he was an outspoken opponent of feminism, saying for example, &quot;If a woman wants to get in the headlines, she should have quintuplets,&quot; &quot; and calling himself a &quot;male chauvinist pig&quot;.

===1970s===
There were a few important legal gains for women in the mid-1970s. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, enacted in 1974, illegalizes credit discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or because someone receives public assistance. Due to this Act, creditors may ask you for most of this information in certain situations, but they may not use it when deciding whether to give you credit or when setting the terms of your credit. In the 1975 Supreme Court case &quot;Taylor v Louisiana&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that excluding women from the jury pool is illegal because it violates a person&#x27;s right to a fair trial by a representative segment of the community. In 1978, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was passed, making employment discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions illegal.

Another important event around this time was the Vietnam War. Approximately 7,000 American military women served in Vietnam during the Vietnam War (1965–1975), the majority of them as nurses. An Army nurse, Sharon Ann Lane, was the only U.S. military woman to die from enemy fire in Vietnam. An Air Force flight nurse, Capt Mary Therese Klinker, died when the C-5A Galaxy transport evacuating Vietnamese orphans which she was aboard crashed on takeoff. Six other American military women also died in the line of duty. An important gain for military women occurred when in 1976, the five federal United States Service academies (West Point, Coast Guard Academy, Naval Academy, Air Force Academy, Merchant Marines Academy) were required to admit women as a result of Public Law 94-106 signed by President Gerald Ford on October 7, 1975. The law passed the House by a vote of 303 to 96 and the Senate by voice vote after divisive argument within Congress, resistance from the Department of Defense and legal action initiated by women to challenge their exclusion. More than 300 women enrolled in the academies in 1976.

===Domestic violence and rape===

During the 1970s, feminists also worked to bring greater attention and help to women suffering from domestic violence and rape. Before the 1970s, very little help was available to battered women. In the 1970s, some of the first battered women&#x27;s shelters were created and states began adopting domestic violence laws providing for civil orders of protection and better police protection (the first women&#x27;s shelter in the modern world was Haven House, which opened in 1964 in California). It is not true that either Catharine MacKinnon or Andrea Dworkin (both feminist activists) said &quot;all sex is rape&quot;, or &quot;all men are rapists,&quot; or &quot;all sex is sexual harassment&quot;, as has been rumored; however, during the 1970s feminist activists worked to change laws stating that there had to be a witness other than the woman herself to charge a man with rape, and that a woman&#x27;s sexual history could be brought up at trial, while the alleged rapist&#x27;s could not. Also, due to feminist activism the first law against marital rape (raping one&#x27;s spouse) was enacted by South Dakota in 1975. By 1993, marital rape had become a crime in all 50 states in America.

===1980s===
The 1980s brought more firsts for American women. 1980 was the first year that a higher percentage of women than men voted in a Presidential election, and a higher percentage of women than men have voted in every Presidential election since. In 1981, Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor was confirmed unanimously by the Senate and became the first female Supreme Court Justice. In 1983, Sally Ride became the first female American astronaut. In 1984, Geraldine Ferraro became the first woman nominated for Vice President by a major party (the Democratic Party), although she was not elected.

Also, in 1984 Kathryn D. Sullivan became the first American woman to walk in space. In 1987, Wilma Mankiller became the first woman to be elected chief of a major Native American tribe (Cherokee). In 1991, she was re-elected with 83% of the vote; during her tenure the Cherokee nation&#x27;s membership more than doubled, to 170,000 from about 68,000. In 1987, Congress declared March as the first National Women&#x27;s History Month. A special Presidential Proclamation is issued every year since which honors the achievements of American women.

===1990s===
Younger women now began to be more involved in feminism. In the early 1990s, third wave feminism began as a response to the second wave&#x27;s perceived inadequacies and shortcomings. Third wave feminism, which continues today, is most often associated with a younger generation of feminist activism, an interest in popular culture and sexual agency, and an acceptance of pluralism and contradiction. In 1991, in Olympia, Washington, Riot grrrl began in reaction to the domination of the punk rock scene of America&#x27;s Pacific Northwest by all-male bands, and as an attempt to establish a female-friendly presence within this scene. Riot grrrl consisted of feminist punk bands such as Bikini Kill and Bratmobile, and their zines, meetings and songs.

The concerns of military women again came to the fore as the Persian Gulf War (1990–1991) utilized an unprecedented proportion of women from the active forces (7%) as well as the Reserve and National Guard (17%). Over 40,000 US military women served in combat support positions throughout the war. Sixteen women died during the war and two were held prisoner. In 1991, the Tailhook Scandal occurred at the annual Tailhook Association convention held in Las Vegas, with more than 26 women (14 of them officers) being assaulted by scores of drunken naval and marine officers. Accusations that the Navy mishandled the subsequent investigation were deeply damaging to the Navy&#x27;s reputation.

Another famous sexual harassment case occurred when in 1991 Anita Hill, a law professor at the University of Oklahoma, came forward with accusations that Clarence Thomas (who had just been nominated for the Supreme Court) had sexually harassed her. Hill had worked for Thomas years earlier when he was head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and she charged that Thomas harassed her with inappropriate discussion of sexual acts and pornographic films after she rebuffed his invitations to date him. When Thomas testified against Hill&#x27;s claims before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he called the hearings, &quot;a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks,&quot; although Hill herself was black. In the end, the Senate voted 52–48 to confirm Clarence Thomas as an associate justice of the Supreme Court.

The 1990s brought more firsts for women in politics and the military. 1992 was known as the &quot;Year of the Woman&quot; because more women than ever before were elected to political office that year (women gained 19 House and 3 Senate seats for a total of 47 seats in the House and seven seats in the Senate) including Carol Moseley Braun, the first black female senator. In 1993, Ruth Bader Ginsburg was confirmed by Congress as a Supreme Court Justice, becoming the second woman on the court. In 1994, Shannon Faulkner applied to The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina and was accepted for admission. She had left her gender information off the application. When it was discovered that she was a woman, The Citadel revoked her offer, so Faulkner filed suit against The Citadel to gain admission. The court rejected The Citadel&#x27;s arguments, clearing her way to attend the school under court order. Faulkner became the first female cadet in 1995, but resigned a few days into her first week. A similar case occurred about this time that forced the Virginia Military Institute to open its doors to women. On June 28, 1996, two days after the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;United States v Virginia,&quot; the Citadel&#x27;s governing board voted unanimously to remove a person&#x27;s gender as a requirement for admission. In 1999, Nancy Mace became the first woman to graduate from the Citadel. The first women graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 2001 (Melissa Graham of Burleson, Texas, and Chih-Yuan Ho of Taipei, Taiwan).

Two important cases concerning women&#x27;s rights were litigated in the late 1990s. The Matter of Kasinga was a legal case decided in June 1996 involving Fauziya Kassindja (surname also spelled as Kasinga), a Togolese teenager seeking asylum in the United States in order to escape a tribal practice of female genital mutilation. The Board of Immigration Appeals granted her asylum in June 1996 after an earlier judge denied her claims. The case set a precedent in United States immigration law as applicants could now seek asylum in the United States from gender-based persecution, whereas previously religious or political grounds were often used to grant asylum. In 1999, Lilly Ledbetter, a supervisor at a Goodyear tire plant in Alabama, sued Goodyear because she was being paid at least 15% less than the men who held the same job. A jury sided with her and awarded her back pay of $224,000 and nearly $3.3 million in punitive damages, but the company appealed, arguing she filed her claim too late, and it won a reversal from a U.S. appeals court in Atlanta. In 2007, the Supreme Court agreed with the company (in &quot;Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.&quot;) and ruled that her suit should have been thrown out at the start because it relied on evidence of discrimination in the 1980s, not on unfair pay decisions in 1998 or 1999; the Supreme Court declared that employees wishing to file discrimination charges must do so no more than 180 days after they have received their first discriminatory paycheck, although Lilly Ledbetter did not know she had been discriminated against in pay until much more than 180 days had passed. However, in 2009 President Barack Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law (the first bill signed into law during his presidency), which changed the law so that now workers can sue up to 180 days after receiving any discriminatory paycheck, not just the first discriminatory paycheck.

==2000–2016==

American women served in the Iraq War from 2003 until 2011. This time included several firsts for women in the military. In 2008, Ann Dunwoody became the first female four-star general in the United States military. In 2011, Sandra Stosz assumed command of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, becoming the first woman superintendent of that institution, and the first woman to command any U.S. service academy. Also in 2011, Patricia Horoho became the first female U.S. Army surgeon general.

In 2004, Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon became the first same-sex couple to be legally married in the United States, since San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom allowed city hall to grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples. However, all same-sex marriages done in 2004 in California were annulled. But after the California Supreme Court decision in 2008 that granted same-sex couples in California the right to marry, Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon remarried, and were again the first same-sex couple in the state to marry. Later in 2008 Prop 8 illegalized same-sex marriage in California until Prop 8 was overturned in 2013, but the marriages that occurred between the California Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage and the approval of Prop 8 illegalizing it are still considered valid, including the marriage of Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon.

American women achieved many political firsts in the 2000s. In 2007, Nancy Pelosi became the first female Speaker of the House of Representatives; she held the position for just under four years. In 2008, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton became the first woman to win a presidential primary, winning the New Hampshire Democratic primary although polls had predicted she would lose. She eventually lost the Democratic nomination for President to Barack Obama, who went on to become President; however, Hillary Clinton did receive 18 million votes. In 2008, Alaska governor Sarah Palin became the first woman nominated for Vice President by the Republican Party, although she was not elected. In 2009, and 2010, respectively, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were confirmed as Supreme Court Associate Justices, making them the third and fourth female justices, but because Justice O&#x27;Connor had previously retired, this made the first time three women have served together on the Supreme Court. Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland was re-elected to a fifth term in 2010; when the 112th Congress was sworn in, she became the longest serving female senator ever, passing Sen. Margaret Chase Smith. During this term, she surpassed Edith Nourse Rogers as the woman to serve the longest in the U.S. Congress.

In 2009, due to the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act being signed into law, the definition of federal hate crime was expanded to include those violent crimes in which the victim is selected due to their actual or perceived gender and/or gender identity; previously federal hate crimes were defined as only those violent crimes where the victim is selected due to their race, color, religion, or national origin. Furthermore, the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act requires the Federal Bureau of Investigation to track statistics on hate crimes based on gender and gender identity (statistics for the other groups were already tracked).

The White House Council on Women and Girls, a council which formed part of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, was established by on March 11, 2009 with a broad mandate to advise the United States President on issues relating to the welfare of women and girls. (The Council was not convened during the Trump administration and was disbanded in 2017.)

In March 2011, the Barack Obama administration released a report, &quot; Women in America: Indicators of Social and Economic Well-Being&quot;, showing women&#x27;s status in the U.S. in 2011 and how it had changed over time. This report was the first comprehensive federal report on women since the report produced by the Commission on the Status of Women in 1963.

In December 2015, Defense Secretary Ash Carter stated that starting in 2016 all combat jobs would open to women.

==Trump era 2015–present==

In July 2016 Hillary Clinton became the Democratic nominee for President of the US, making her the first woman on a major party ticket to receive the nomination for President of the United States. While she lost the electoral college vote to Donald Trump, she notably won the popular vote by millions of votes. 
According to Leandra Zarnow, Donald Trump made anti-feminism a central theme of his presidential campaign in 2016 against Democrat Hillary Clinton, the first woman candidate for president from a major party. Once in office, he emphasized themes of masculinity, and traditional gender roles, appealing especially to his religious base. He did appoint of few senior women, including Nikki Haley as ambassador to the United Nations from 2017 to 2018. The key appointment was his daughter Ivanka Trump as a major advisor in numerous areas. Trump staffed his press office with talented conservative women. At every turn he rejected feminist issues, especially regarding abortion rights. The Trump coalition strongly opposed abortion, and made it part of foreign policy by reinstating the &quot;global gag rule&quot;. It ended funding for overseas NGOs that promoted abortion as a form of family planning, or provided information, referrals or counselling to enable an abortion.

In response feminists organized and rallied. The Women&#x27;s March, the largest single-day demonstration in U.S. history, 
was a worldwide protest on January 21, 2017, to advocate legislation and policies regarding human rights and other issues, including women&#x27;s rights, immigration reform, healthcare reform, the natural environment, LGBTQ rights, racial equality, freedom of religion, and workers&#x27; rights. The rallies were aimed at Donald Trump, immediately following his inauguration as President of the United States, largely due to statements and positions attributed to him regarded by many as anti-women or otherwise offensive. Angry women marchers sometimes carried posters featuring offensive or obscene humor to ridule Trump&#x27;s body, his misogyny and his pussy grabbing, with slogans such as, &quot;Keep your tiny hands off my human rights!.&quot;. Social media became a force as the MeToo movement demonstrated. The hashtag #MeToo went viral in late 2017. Facebook reported that almost half of its American users were friends with someone who felt they had been sexually assaulted or harassed. Success came with major Democratic gains. In 2018 the largest number of women ever were elected to Congress, with Democrat Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House. In 2020 Trump was defeated and Republicans lost the Senate.

In 2020, U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California was selected as the vice presidential nominee for the Democratic ticket. Harris was the third woman and first African American as well as first Asian American to win a place on a major party presidential ticket. In November 2020, Joseph Biden and Harris were elected President and Vice President, securing victories in both the electoral college and the popular vote. They won the electoral college 306 to 232 and secured a popular vote victory with a more than 7 million vote lead over the Republican incumbent ticket. Thus Harris became the first woman, and first person of color, elected to the vice presidency in American history. She was inaugurated on January 20, 2021 becoming the 49th Vice President of the United States and highest ranking female in the U.S. history. Harris would later become the first female to serve as Acting President of the United States.

==Historiography==
===Popular history===
Women&#x27;s history has a long historiography of popular writing as non-academics in new women&#x27;s societies succeeded in shaping public memory and history education in American school houses, albeit along racially segregated lines. The earliest histories of American women were authored during the 19th century non-academic women writers reaching out to popular audiences, or to document the history of women&#x27;s civic and activist organizations. For example, abolitionists Sarah Grimke and Lydia Maria Child wrote brief histories of women in the 1830s, while Elizabeth Ellet wrote &quot;Women of the American Revolution&quot; (1848), &quot;A Domestic History of the American Revolution&quot; (1850), &quot;and Pioneer Women of the West&quot; (1852). Meanwhile, women&#x27;s organizations like the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union, National American Woman Suffrage Association, and National Association of Colored Women published their own institutional histories. New patriotic societies like the Daughters of the American Revolution and the United Daughters of the Confederacy created &quot;filiopietistic&quot; publications on history and women in history, developed school curricula, and engaged in historic preservation work. Both black and white women in women&#x27;s clubs actively participated in this work during the twentieth century in their efforts to shape the broader culture. 

In the early twentieth century, for example, the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) coordinated efforts across the South to tell the story of the Confederacy and its women on the Confederate home front, while male historians spent their time with battles and generals. The women emphasized female activism, initiative, and leadership. They reported that when all the men left for war, the women took command, found ersatz and substitute foods, rediscovered their old traditional skills with the spinning wheel when factory cloth became unavailable, and ran all the farm or plantation operations. They faced danger without having men in the traditional role of their protectors. Historian Jacquelyn Dowd Hall argues that the UDC was a powerful promoter of women&#x27;s history:UDC leaders were determined to assert women&#x27;s cultural authority over virtually every representation of the region&#x27;s past. This they did by lobbying for state archives and museums, national historic sites, and historic highways; compiling genealogies; interviewing former soldiers; writing history textbooks; and erecting monuments, which now moved triumphantly from cemeteries into town centers. More than half a century before women&#x27;s history and public history emerged as fields of inquiry and action, the UDC, with other women&#x27;s associations, strove to etch women&#x27;s accomplishments into the historical record and to take history to the people, from the nursery and the fireside to the schoolhouse and the public square.

===Academic historiography===
The scholarly field of American women&#x27;s history became a major field of academic inquiry in the 1970s. The subject of women was largely ignored within the historical discipline during the period in which the discipline emerged and professionalized from the 1880s to 1910. The overwhelmingly male new academic discipline saw its purview as relatively limited to the study of the evolution of politics, government, and the law, and emphasized research in official state documents, thus leaving little room for an examination of women&#x27;s activities or lives. 

The most famous call to develop the history of American women came from distinguished Harvard historian Arthur Schlesinger, Sr. in the 1920s and 1930s. His graduate students and their graduate students were major contributors to the scholarly subfield of women&#x27;s history. The Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America at Harvard, for example, was founded in 1943 as the Radcliffe Woman&#x27;s Archives. Between 1957 and 1971, this library produced a seminal scholarly reference work on women in American history, &quot;Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary, 1607–1950&quot; (1971). It coordinated the work of hundreds of historians—men and women—and was published to widespread acclaim in 1971.  

Academic historians, meanwhile, sporadically produced and reviewed scholarly monographs in American women&#x27;s history from the 1930s through the 1950s as well. The work of Alma Lutz, Elisabeth Anthony Dexter, Julia Cherry Spruill, Antoinette Elizabeth Taylor, Mary Elizabeth Massey, Caroline Ware, and especially Eleanor Flexner and Mary Ritter Beard, all focused on the history of American women. They were relatively well-known during their time, even if some of these scholars did not enjoy insider status within the historical profession.

In response to the new social history of the 1960s and the modern women&#x27;s movement, increasing numbers of scholars, especially female graduate students training in universities across the country, began to focus on the history of women. They initially struggled to find mentors in male-dominated history departments. Students in the Columbia University History Department produced several early significant works in the 1960s. Gerda Lerner&#x27;s dissertation, published as &quot;The Grimke Sisters of South Carolina&quot;, in 1967, and Aileen Kraditor&#x27;s &quot;The Ideas of the Woman Suffrage Movement&quot;, published in 1965 are just two notable examples.  Ann Firor Scott, a graduate of Harvard, who studied under Oscar Handlin in the 1950s, wrote a dissertation on the Southern Progressive movement, discovering the existence of many female progressives in her research. By 1970, she had published &quot;The Southern Lady: From the Pedestal&quot; &quot;to Politics&quot;. These new ventures into women&#x27;s history were made within mainstream academic institutions. Lerner and Scott would become leading lights and organizers for the field&#x27;s younger practitioners in the coming decades. Their contributions to American history were recognized by the Organization of American Historians and the Southern Historical Association when they were elected to the presidencies of those professional organizations in the early 1980s.

The field of women&#x27;s history exploded after 1969. New historians of women organized within the major national historical associations from 1969 forward to promote scholarship about women. This included the American Historical Association, the Organization of American Historians, and the Southern Historical Association. Each created status-of-women committees and made developing women&#x27;s history a major goal. They started by gathering data and writing bibliographies in the field to identify areas in need of study. Then they completed the research and produced the monographs that vitalized this field. They also created around a dozen regional women&#x27;s history organizations and conference groups of their own to support their scholarly work and build intellectual and professional networks. These included the Coordinating Committee on Women in the Historical Profession—Conference Group on Women&#x27;s History (1969), the Berkshire Conference on the History of Women (1973), West Coast Association of Women Historians (1970), Women Historians of the Midwest(1973), Southern Association for Women Historians (1970), Upstate New York Women&#x27;s History Organization (1975), New England Association of Women Historians (1972), Association of Black Women Historians (1979), and others.

The scholarship this growing cohort of historians created was soon vast, diverse, and theoretically complex. Almost from its inception, the new women&#x27;s history of the 1970s focused on the differential experiences of white women of diverse backgrounds, women of color, working class women, relations of power between men and women, women&#x27;s social and political activism, and how to integrate women&#x27;s history into mainstream American history narratives. There was a pervasive concern with understanding the impact of race, class, gender, and sexuality on the histories of women—despite later claims to the contrary. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, American women&#x27;s historians like Elizabeth Fox-Genovese and Joan Kelly were considering sexual relations of power, sex roles; the problem of fitting women&#x27;s history into traditional frameworks of periodization; and Joan Wallach Scott&#x27;s call to apply gender as a &quot;Useful Category of Historical Analysis.&quot; In the U.S., historians of women in Europe, America, and the rest of the world collaborated by working together in the discipline&#x27;s professional institutions, and in the triennial Berkshire Conference on the History of Women. This &quot;Big Berks Conference,&quot; which met for the first time at Douglass College (the women&#x27;s coordinate college of Rutgers University), in 1973, for the second time at Radcliffe College in 1974, and then again in 1976 at Bryn Mawr College, quickly became a women&#x27;s history institution in the United States. Here, historians of women presented their recent research, planned for the future of women&#x27;s history, and shared one another&#x27;s theoretical insights to strengthen the standing of women&#x27;s history in academia broadly across the traditional boundaries of regional/geographic specialization. The Big Berks has been regularly attended by over a thousand scholars from around the world every three years up until 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the conference organizers to cancel the planned meeting at Johns Hopkins University for the first time in 46 years.

An important development of the 1980s was the fuller integration of women into the history of race and slavery and race into the history of women. This work was preceded by the work of black club women, historic preservationists, archivists, and educators in the early twentieth century. Black women&#x27;s double marginalization from the historical profession, on the basis of race and sex, led credentialed black female historians of the mid-century to focus on rather traditional historical topics in their research prior to the Civil Rights Era. Gerda Lerner published a significant document reader, &quot;Black Women in White America&quot; in 1972 (Pantheon Publishers). The close historical ties between the history of the 19th-century women&#x27;s movement and the 19th-century abolitionist movement and the involvement of female historians of the 1960s and 1970s in the movements of the New Left, including the civil rights movement, fostered considerable interest by white female historians in the history of black women as a corollary to their interest in social movement history generally. For example, Sara Evans and Jacquelyn Dowd Hall wrote important dissertations addressing the historical intersections between women&#x27;s social justice activism and race during the 1960s that were published in the 1970s. These studies were however, only partly focused on black women. By the 1970s though, African-American female historians were completing dissertations and seeking presses to publish their research. Rosalyn Terborg-Penn completed her dissertation on African-American female suffragists in 1977. Shortly thereafter she and Sharon Harley published a collection of important essays in &quot;The Afro-American Woman: Struggles and Images&quot; in 1978. Deborah Gray White&#x27;s &quot;Ar&#x27;n&#x27;t I a Woman? Female Slaves in the Plantation South&quot; (1985) helped to open up analysis of race, slavery, abolitionism and feminism, as well as resistance, power, activism, and themes of violence, sexualities, and the body. The professional service of Darlene Clark Hine, Rosalyn Terborg-Penn, and Nell Irvin Painter and their scholarship on African-American women continued to break important ground in the 1980s and 1990s. This included their active participation in mainstream history associations and the establishment of the Association of Black Women Historians in 1979. Native American, Latino and Asian-American scholars also strove to recover and incorporate the history of women in these subfields and found outlets for their work in women&#x27;s history publications and conferences.

By the late 1980s, women&#x27;s history in the United States had matured and proliferated enough to support its own standalone scholarly journal to showcase scholarship in the field. The major women&#x27;s history journal published in the U.S. is &quot;The Journal of Women&#x27;s History,&quot; launched in 1989 by Joan Hoff and Christie Farnham Pope. It was first published out of Indiana University and continues to be published quarterly today, though its editorial headquarters rotates to different universities. Indeed, the field became so prolific and established by the turn of the 21st century in fact that it had become one of the most commonly claimed fields of specialization of all professional historians in the U.S., according to Robert Townsend of the American Historical Association. Major trends in the history of American women in recent years have emphasized the study of global and transnational histories of women and histories of conservative women.

Women&#x27;s history continues to be a robust and prolific field in the United States, and new scholarship is published regularly in the history discipline&#x27;s mainstream, regional, and subfield-specific journals.

<doc id="469035" wikidata="Q2131655" url="?curid=469035" title="Rapper sword">
<text>Rapper sword (also known as short sword dance) is a variation of sword dance unique to Northumberland and County Durham. It emerged from the pit villages of Tyneside and Wearside, where miners first performed the tradition.

The dance requires five performers who co-ordinate themselves while using &quot;rapper swords&quot; made from flexible steel. Accompanied by traditional folk music, the dancers wear hard-soled shoes that allow for percussive foot movements. Mental alertness, in addition to physical agility, is required in order for dance participants to use the swords effectively without causing harm to themselves or the other performers.

==History==

Whilst substantial evidence for the origins of the rapper sword tradition does not exist, as of 2012, since the publication of &quot;Rapper; The miner&#x27;s Dance of North East England&quot; by Phil Heaton it is generally accepted that the dance was originally performed in the mining villages of the Northumberland and Durham coalfield in North-East England. The dances derive from a well-defined geographical area with an intensity of activity traced to pits along both the Durham and Northumberland banks of the river Tyne, south into County Durham past Sunderland and along the Northumberland coast. The earliest definite account of hilt-and-point sword dancing in England dates back to an article in 1715 describing a dance in the Tyne Valley to the west of Newcastle upon Tyne. The dance described closely resembles long sword dances of the Yorkshire and rather than the rapper dance. A documented account of the Tyne Valley dance has been located in a 1715 article, in which a fairly accurate description can be read. Later references to sword dancing in the northern counties include a dance described in 1787 in the Cumberland Packet newspaper of January 1788, and a description from Teesdale in 1778, referenced by Hutchinson in his &quot;View of Northumberland&quot;.

At some stage in the nineteenth century, the rigid swords were replaced by flexible rappers in the coalfield. Very little is known about this major development in the tradition because of an absence of sufficient evidence, and it may have been entirely accidental. It used to be commonly thought that the flexible version was used for removing dirt from the backs of pit ponies, but there is no available documentation to verify this theory. It seems that two factors have influenced interpretations of when the rapper sword was introduced: firstly, the relocation of a steel works operation by Ambrose Crowley to the Derwent Valley, before which time it is believed that suitable steel for flexible swords would most likely have been unavailable; and secondly, the prohibitive expense of such instruments before the Bessemer process in 1855 that allowed steel to be made inexpensively.

The dance involves five people, with many including characters, such as Tommy and Betty, who announce the dance, engage the audience and most importantly, collect money from the onlookers. The performers are connected by short swords bearing two handles, with the handle on at least one end being fixed. The other handle is either fixed or swivelling, based on the preference of the rapper side. The flexible rapper swords form an unbroken chain connecting the dancers. The dance is related to the Long Sword dance of Yorkshire, as well as other sword dances in Europe. Some of the earliest teams used hornpipes, rather than the jigs used in the modern era.

===Nineteenth century===
During the nineteenth century, teams of rapper dancers from the pit villages of Tyneside and Wearside would travel annually to the towns of Newcastle upon Tyne, Sunderland and Durham to perform the dance for the crowds, asking for monetary consideration. This was later revived as a source of income during the miners&#x27; strikes and lay-offs, especially when the collieries were closed down over winter. Sword dancers of the North East were also active in the political struggles of the coalfield. A team of Tyneside Rovers were part of an early march on parliament in 1890, and another team from Hebburn were part of the famous Jarrow Crusade in 1936. Teams were also reported all over Durham and Northumberland as dancing out and collecting in the 1926 miners&#x27; strike and later in the Great Depression.

===Twentieth century===
By the early twentieth century, the tradition was beginning to die out, but was revived by the interest generated after Cecil Sharp published notations for five of the traditional village dances in his book, &quot;The Sword Dances of Northern England&quot;. After the First World War, the revival was marked by the fierce competition between pit villages in the rapper classes of the newly instituted &quot;North of England Musical Tournament&quot; held annually in Newcastle upon Tyne.

After the Second World War, the tradition progressively declined in the original pit villages, partly as a result of social changes in the mining communities. However, another revival was initiated after the war, in 1949 by students at Kings College in Newcastle upon Tyne (now the University of Newcastle upon Tyne), which subsequently spread beyond the traditional area. Revival teams worldwide now perform the rapper tradition, sometimes learned from published notations, sometimes taught by rapper dancers in what is almost a continuation of the earlier oral traditions.

===Twenty-first century===
The dance has transformed as it moved into the twenty-first century: the pace has quickened and is performed at around 140–160 beats per minute, with different team styles using different rates. It is nonetheless typically performed in a smooth and graceful manner, with one figure flowing seamlessly into the next. A number of acrobatic figures can be employed, including forward and backward somersaults over the swords.

The dance is now almost always performed to jigs (perhaps 90% of the time), with the normal form of rapper stepping being a form of shuffle imported from the local clogging tradition. The jigs used include local tunes and many instruments can, and have been, used to accompany rapper dances (the most popular being fiddles, tin whistles and accordions or melodeons). Many rapper jigs used for the last hundred years are tunes that were probably imported by Irish and Scottish immigrants to Tyneside in the nineteenth century. The music is usually performed solo, although it can be performed as a duet; however, rapper is not usually performed to a band. There is much controversy in the rapper community over the use of any form of percussion to accompany rapper beyond the rapper stepping included in the dance.

In modern times, the competitive element of rapper sword dancing has been revived in the form of the Dancing England Rapper Tournament (DERT) competition, and in recent years its American counterpart, Dancing America Rapper Tournament (DART).

==Costume==

The costume in which the dance is usually performed, referred to as the &quot;kit&quot;, is a stylised version of the working clothes of the local nineteenth century coal miner (&quot;see photograph&quot;). It consists of a shirt; sash; &quot;breeks&quot; (breeches), &quot;hoggers&quot; (similar to breeks but shorter), or long trousers; and socks or stockings. Some traditional teams decorated their kit with ribbons or rosettes, and added a tie and/or waistcoat.

Modern teams use a variety of kits, mostly based on the traditional costume, with each team using different combinations of colours to try to have a unique corporate image. Some other modern sides, especially women&#x27;s sides, use very different kits.

==Performances==
===Dancing in pubs===
Unlike Cotswold Morris and other forms of traditional dance, Rapper Sword is often performed inside pubs, with &#x27;rapper crawls&#x27;, often on Friday nights, providing an opportunity for the general public (including those who have little interest in folk dance traditions) to see the dance being performed.

Performances in busy, noisy pubs in front of an audience which may not be familiar with the tradition provides an opportunity for the comic characters, the Tommy and Betty (although often just the Tommy) to explain the dance and engage with the audience.

===Dancing at folk festivals===
Rapper sword teams also appear at folk festivals across the UK such as Sidmouth Folk Festival.

===DERT competition===
The Dancing England Rapper Tournament (DERT) competition, which is open to all rapper sword teams, is held annually in a different UK city or town by a different Rapper side. The tournament initially comprised 3 divisions: Premier, Championship and Open, with a youth competition, &#x27;DERTy&#x27;, subsequently added. A further class, &#x27;Traditional dance&#x27;, was also introduced to highlight the original recorded dances and the style they were performed in.

In 2020, the competition was postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. The DERT 2021 competition, due to be held in Edinburgh on 26–28 March 2021, was also cancelled due to COVID-19. 

=== DART competition ===
The Dancing America Rapper Tournament (DART) is an American offshoot of DERT, happening annually on the East Coast of the United States since 2010. Featuring anywhere from 6 to 16 sides, DART is less focused on the competition side and more focused on building community among the still-growing rapper sword community in the United States.

==Further information==

The Rapper Online website provides information on the origins and history of the dance, team profiles and notations of traditional dances. Current and historical information is also available at &quot;The NUT on the Net&quot;, the Internet edition of &quot;The NUT&quot;, the journal of the rapper sword dance.

Leading exponents of the tradition in its traditional area include the High Spen Blue Diamonds, the Newcastle Kingsmen, Monkseaton Morris Men, the Sallyport Sword Dancers and Star and Shadow. In addition to the Rapper Online website&#x27;s list of rapper sword teams the Sword Dance Union has produced a map of current UK teams.

Rapper dancing has gained international popularity. Jack The Rapper, based in Norway, attended DERT in 1996, 1999 and 2003. The DERT 2005 and 2006 competitions were attended by four teams from the United States, named, Newhaven, Candyrapper (2005), Beside the Point (2006) and Scrambled Six (2007). Red Mum Rapper from Denmark competed in DERTs 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2018. The Pocket Flyers (USA) attended DERT 2015 in Bristol. Rapper teams also exist in Australia, Germany and the Basque Country of France.

<doc id="469043" wikidata="Q254293" url="?curid=469043" title="Hispano-Suiza 12Y">
<text>The Hispano-Suiza 12Y was an aircraft engine produced by Hispano-Suiza for the French Air Force before the Second World War. The 12Y became the primary French 1,000 hp (750 kW) class engine and was used in a number of famous aircraft, including the Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 and Dewoitine D.520.

Its design was based on the earlier, and somewhat smaller, 12X. The 12X did not see widespread use before the 12Y replaced it and became one of the most powerful French designs on the eve of the war. The 12Z was being designed but this was ended by the fall of France and the German occupation.

The 12Y was produced under Hispano-Suiza licence in the Soviet Union as the Klimov M-100. This design led to the highly successful Klimov VK-105 series that powered the Yakovlev and Lavochkin fighters as well as the Petlyakov Pe-2 bomber. Licensed production of the early models was also undertaken in Czechoslovakia as the Avia HS 12Ydrs and in Switzerland as the HS-77.

==Design and development==

===Early development===
The 12Y was a fairly traditional in construction, a 36-litre water-cooled V-12 with the two cast aluminium cylinder banks set at 60 degrees to each other. The cylinder heads were not removable, instead both cylinder banks could be quickly removed from the crankcase section of the engine. This made it somewhat famous for being leak-proof, a design feature that was considered by other designers and almost became a part of the Rolls-Royce Merlin.

The major design change from the earlier 12X was to use a master-articulated connecting rod system, instead of the fork-and-blade type. A single overhead camshaft (SOHC) drove the valves, which were filled with liquid sodium for cooling. Only a single intake and exhaust valve were used, unlike most designs of the era which had moved to three or four valves per cylinder. A single-stage, single-speed supercharger was standard, although the art of designing a useful intake was not as well developed as in other countries, and high altitude performance was always lacking.

The first 12Y test articles were constructed in 1932, and almost immediately the entire French aviation industry began designing aeroplanes based on it. At the time the engine developed only 760 hp (570 kW), but it was clear it had potential to the 1,000 hp (750 kW) class. An early modification led to the Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs which used a hollow propeller shaft to allow a 20 mm cannon to fire through the propeller spinner (a combination known as a &quot;moteur-canon&quot;). All later versions shared this feature. The 12Ydrs was the next major series, with a basic rating of 836 hp (623 kW) at sea level with a compression ratio of 5.8:1.

The Armée de l&#x27;Air changed their nomenclature, so the next version was the Hispano-Suiza 12Y-21, which increased the compression ratio to 7:1, when running on 100 octane gasoline. This boosted power to 867 hp (647  kW). In 1936 the connecting rod design was changed slightly to create the 12Y-31, but the lower 5.8:1 compression ratio was retained and the power was increased only slightly over the drs model to 850 hp (630 kW). Nevertheless, this became one of the most used engine designs of the pre-war era, used in almost all French fighter designs and prototypes.

===Late variants===
A real effort to improve the performance of the engine in 1938 resulted in the Hispano-Suiza 12Y-45, which used the S-39-H3 supercharger co-designed by André Planiol and Polish engineer Joseph Szydlowski. The Szydlowski-Planiol device was larger, but much more efficient than the mediocre Hispano-Suiza models. When used with 100 octane fuel, the supercharger boosted to the -21&#x27;s 7:1, increasing power to 900 hp (670 kW). Combined with the Ratier constant-speed propeller, this allowed the D.520 to perform as well as contemporary designs from Germany and England.

Another improvement in supercharging led to the Hispano-Suiza 12Y-49, whose performance improved from 850 hp (630 kW) at sea level to 920 hp (690 kW) at just over 10,000 ft (3,000 m). This improvement in power with altitude was a common feature of most engines of the era, the result of the supercharger &quot;robbing&quot; power at low altitudes while not boosting the power due to the possibility of detonation.

The final major version was the 1,085 hp (809 kW) Hispano-Suiza 12Y-51, which had just started into production at the time of the Armistice with Germany. The -51 was the first version that came close to the performance limits of the engine, although the single-stage supercharging meant that it was unable to compete with designs from England and Germany above 15,000 ft (5,000 m).

===Foreign derivatives===
In the early 1930s Czechoslovakia gained rights to build a license version of the HS-12Y. This was produced by Avia (Škoda) at Prag - Čakovice. The engine was intended to become the standard powerplant of all Czechoslovak military aircraft. Both the HS-12Ycrs and HS-12Ydrs were built in quantity and were more commonly known by these names rather than any Czechoslovakian designation. Aircraft powered by these engines included the Czechoslovak Avia B-34, Avia B-534, Avia B-71, Avia B-35, Avia B-135 and the Yugoslav Rogožarski IK-3 .

Switzerland license built and assembled several different versions of the basic 12Ycrs for use in several aircraft: the reconnaissance biplane the EKW C-35, the multipurpose EKW C-36, the Swiss assembled D-3800 copy of the French M.S. 406 fighter and Swiss built versions of the French M.S.412 fighter called the D.3801. Saurer developed the engine further after the Fall of France into the YS-2 and YS-3 engines. These were used in more powerful follow-on versions of the same basic French fighter design, the M.S.450 called the D.3802 and then the final version called the D.3803.

In the mid-1930s, Russian engineer Vladimir Klimov was sent to France to obtain a license for local production of the 12Y. A series of design changes were added to cope with cold weather operation, and the engine entered production in 1935 as the Klimov M-100 with about 750 hp (560 kW). However a series of continual upgrades increased the allowable RPM from the 12Y&#x27;s fairly low 2,400 to 2,700, thereby increasing power to 1,100 hp (820 kW). The resulting design, the Klimov M-105 (VK-105) became one of the major Soviet engine designs during the war, powering all Yakovlev fighters.

<doc id="469046" wikidata="Q7793855" url="?curid=469046" title="Thomas Seckford">
<text>Thomas Seckford or Thomas Sakford Esquire (1515–1587) was a senior lawyer, a &quot;man of business&quot; at the court of Queen Elizabeth I, a landowner of the armigerous Suffolk gentry, Member of Parliament, and public benefactor of the town of Woodbridge. He was one of the Masters in Ordinary of the Court of Requests to Queen Elizabeth, 1569–1587, and was Surveyor of the Court of Wards and Liveries 1581–1587. He built mansions in Woodbridge, Ipswich and Clerkenwell, and was at different times Steward of the Liberty of Ely (St Etheldreda) in Suffolk, Bailiff for the Crown of the former possessions of Clerkenwell Priory in the City of London and County of Middlesex, and deputy Steward for the northern parts of the Duchy of Lancaster (to which he owed his early patronage). He was the patron of Christopher Saxton in the making of the first surveyed County Atlas of England and Wales.

The received portrait of Thomas Seckford, as it appears on Loder&#x27;s 1796 token, as frontispiece to Loder&#x27;s 1792 printing of Seckford&#x27;s original Statutes for the Almshouses which he founded in Woodbridge, and in other recensions, was derived by the Woodbridge artist Isaac Johnson (c. 1754–1835) from a 16th-century painting depicting William Cecil presiding over the Court of Wards and Liveries. The figure identified as Seckford wears a tall patterned hat and sits at the table on the mid-left of the early painting. The &quot;possible&quot; identification as Seckford was made in the caption to an engraving by George Vertue after the original painting, published by the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1747 for the &quot;Vetusta Monumenta&quot;, noting that the figure is likely to be the Surveyor because he wears his tall hat in the presence of the Master.

He is not to be confused with his younger brother, Thomas Seckford of Ludlow, also a member of parliament, nor with his father, also Thomas Seckford (of Great Bealings), nor with his nephew Thomas Seckford, buried at Trinity College, Cambridge.

==Sekford of Great Bealings and Woodbridge==

The Seckford family was associated with a place named Sekford in the parish of Great Bealings from early times. A Sekford Hall manor, the second manor, is listed in Domesday Book, and it was held in 1185 by Bartholomew de Sekford, son of William de Sekford, when it passed to Bartholomew&#x27;s son John de Sekford. From this period the tenure of the Seckford Hall manor came down to the family of Thomas Seckford. The Seckford family had also been substantial landowners in Woodbridge since the time of Edward III at least, when (in 1335) a grant (of special grace) of free warren was made to John de Sekford and his heirs in his demesne lands in Great and Little Bealings, Martlesham, Woodbridge, Hasketon, Burgh and Boulge: John was also holding a manor of Clopton from John, Earl of Cornwall. Lands were released by Sir John de Sekford, Kt., in 1359.

At the time of his death in 1505, the benefactor&#x27;s grandfather Thomas Seckford held Seckford Hall manor and the advowson of Little Bealings from Sir John Wingfield, Kt., and lands and estates in the parishes mentioned above, principally from Sir William Willoughby, Lord de Willoughby and from John Blenerhassett of Loudham, Suffolk (an historic estate in Pettistree). He and his wife Margaret (Purrye) were buried at Great Bealings, where a monument was recorded by John Weever. It was perhaps the grandfather Thomas who built the brick porch of Great Bealings church, as recorded by a carved inscription. By his will, his lands were to be held by his widow, making an allowance to his son Thomas (the benefactor&#x27;s father), then aged nearly ten, until he should reach the age of 21. He also held manors in Norfolk which were to be administered for Thomas until that time. The Woodbridge manor and market were anciently granted to Woodbridge Priory, but at the time of the dissolution came into the hands of the Wingfield family.

==Early life==
Thomas Seckford the benefactor was born near Woodbridge, Suffolk, England, the second son of Thomas Seckford of Great Bealings (c. 1495–1575) and his wife Margaret (c. 1493–1557), daughter of Sir John Wingfield (died 1509) of Letheringham, Suffolk and his wife Anne Tuchet, daughter of the 6th Baron Audley. His mother was a sister of Sir Anthony Wingfield&#x27;s. His elder brother&#x27;s name was Francis, and there were younger brothers John, Anthony, Humfrey, Henry and Thomas and sisters Mary and Elizabeth.

Thomas is believed to have been educated at the University of Cambridge (where he presumably studied law): if so, he was in the university at the time of the flourishing of reformed classical learning under the influence of Thomas Smith and John Cheke and their circle. In 1540 he entered Gray&#x27;s Inn: his name in the register of admissions appears alongside that of Cheke&#x27;s most eminent pupil William Cecil, the future Lord Burghley, with whom he worked at various times during his life. He was called to the bar in 1542, and Gray&#x27;s Inn admitted him to the grand company of Ancients in 1547.
It has been presumed that Seckford&#x27;s religious sympathies were with the reforming party. In 1539 Seckford&#x27;s uncle Sir Anthony Wingfield, then newly admitted to the Privy Council of Henry VIII, had a lease of the former priory manor of Woodbridge from the Augmentions Office, and the reversion and rent of the manor was granted to his eldest son, John Wingfield of Hasketon and his wife Dorothy, in 1541. In 1542 John Wingfield demolished the priory church and added the land to the parish churchyard. However John Wingfield died without an heir, and the priory manor remained to his widow for term of her life, with reversion to the Crown.

Seckford&#x27;s near relationship to Anthony Wingfield no doubt favoured him, and despite his uncle&#x27;s death in 1552 that advantage persisted through Sir Anthony&#x27;s son, Seckford&#x27;s cousin Robert Wingfield, Captain of the Guard to Edward VI. In 1549 Robert Wingfield was active in persuading the king to remove Protector Somerset, and to place him under guard. Wingfield married Cecily, sister of Thomas Wentworth, 2nd Baron Wentworth (whom Queen Mary appointed Lord Deputy of Calais in 1553), and received knighthood from Mary.

At the start of Mary&#x27;s reign, early in 1554, Seckford obtained a minor post in the Duchy of Lancaster, and this is taken to account for his entry into parliament for the duchy seat of Ripon in November 1554; similarly, the patronage of William Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby of Parham, is supposed to underlie Seckford&#x27;s return to parliament as MP for Orford in 1555 and 1558. His distinction as a lawyer was thoroughly recognized by his appointment as Lent Reader at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1556.

Seckford&#x27;s father began the building of the great brick mansion of Seckford Hall in Great Bealings after 1553, but, although it was so close to Woodbridge, and Queen Elizabeth is known later to have held court there, this never became the benefactor&#x27;s personal residence. Nor did his mother live long to enjoy it, for Margaret Seckford (née Wingfield) died in 1557 aged 64.

==Elizabethan prosperity==
At the onset of the reign of Elizabeth, Thomas Seckford received rapid advancement and various tokens of royal approval. In her Letters Patent of 1587 for Seckford&#x27;s Almshouses in Woodbridge, Elizabeth wrote of &quot;Our well beloved and faithful Thomas Seckford, Esquire, who hath faithfully served Us from the first Day of February, in the Third Year of Our Reign, for Our Counsel about Our Person and attendances about the same.&quot;

He and Dr. Walter Haddon were almost immediately appointed Elizabeth&#x27;s two Masters in Ordinary of the Court of Requests, a role which Seckford held until his death. In January 1558/59 they are described as &quot;learned in the Comon Lawes of this realme.&quot; These officers, assistants to the Lord Privy Seal (Sir Nicholas Bacon, 1558–1571) as chief Judge, dealt with poor men&#x27;s causes brought by petition before Elizabeth as she journeyed around her realm. In accompanying her he maintained a position close to the monarch and gained a knowledge of the different parts of Britain. In a commission of October 1560 he is mentioned as a Doctor of both laws, having sat with Archbishop Matthew Parker, Sir Anthony Cooke and others in a Final Decree.

He was, simultaneously, Steward of the Court of the Marshalsea, deputy chief Steward for the Duchy of Lancaster (northern parts), in the commission of the peace for Suffolk and Middlesex (1558/59), and a commissioner for ecclesiastical causes in 1559. In 1561 he was a commissioner for the preparation of orders and regulations for the governance of the Fleet Prison.

===Ipswich and Woodbridge===

Seckford was chosen with Robert Barker to represent Ipswich in parliament in 1559, and again with Edward Grimston in 1563. In the latter year he was appointed Steward of the Liberty of the Bishop of Ely (Liberty of St Etheldreda) in Suffolk.

In February 1562 he had permission to rebuild the sill of his mansion in Ipswich (which had a frontage onto Westgate Street where Museum Street now emerges) on condition that it did not impinge on the traffic in the highway. Although not so grand as Edmund Withypoll&#x27;s Christchurch Mansion, Seckford&#x27;s &quot;Great Place&quot; was one of the noble structures of Tudor Ipswich. The southern prospect, illustrated by John Ogilby for his &quot;Ichnographical Survey&quot; of Ipswich (by which time it belonged to Sir William Barker), shows a building of two principal storeys with five bays of Tudor fenestration, the first, third and fifth rising to gabled attic windows above, the whole flanked by a pair of four-storey towers with paired windows in each storey, and pyramidally-roofed with dormers above, crowned with onion-shaped pinnacles. The central three bays overshot a loggia in the ground floor of five round arches, from which a view south, across a formal garden and (beyond the river Orwell) towards Stoke, was afforded.

In May 1564 he purchased from the Crown the reversion of the manor and site of Woodbridge Priory (pending the death of Dorothy Wingfield), together with the capital mansion, all its dependent lands in Martlesham, Bealings, Hasketon, Grundisburgh, the Woodbridge water-mill and rectory, the manor and capital mansion of Haspely in Newbourne, the manor and chapel of Alnesbourne &quot;or St Petronelle&quot;, the rectory of Brandeston, and all fairs, markets, tolls and customs, as they had been enjoyed by the priory. For all this he paid £764.8s.4d.

Seckford built or completed the brick mansion at the priory site, which became his private residence in the town. It was (and partly remains, though much renovated, reformed and embellished) a tall south-facing two-storey structure with gabled dormers above (four survive), with stucco-finished brick mouldings and mullions. Portions of former gabled cross-wings survive on the north side. The most striking survival is the three-storey brick porch (with a rooms in the upper storeys) with triple superimposed orders, its entrance archway in the Doric style with fluted pilasters, and its upper storeys with plain brick-formed pilasters. The Seckford coat of arms over the south porch is dated 1564, but the &quot;capital mansion&quot; at the priory (i.e. principal seat of the estate) itself may have been constructed before that.
Seckford also built the nearby Woodbridge Shire Hall, or Sessions-Hall, when the quarter-sessions were removed from Melton, as a two-storey structure with open market below (the arches of which have since been infilled), and a room above which he gave to the County in perpetuity. Seckford&#x27;s arms are displayed in stonework over the first floor west entrance. He became Treasurer of Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1565.

===Marriage===
On 5 February 1566/67 Seckford married Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Harlowe, at St Mary Woolnoth in the City of London. Elizabeth had moved in the higher circles of London civic society, and was already twice widowed. Her first husband, William Billingsley (died 1553), was a prominent citizen and Haberdasher and Assay-master of the Tower of London and Southwark mints, by whom she was the mother of Henry Billingsley, a future Lord Mayor of London. Her second husband was Sir Martin Bowes (died 1566), one of the great Lords Mayors in the last years of Henry VIII, destroyer of the monuments in the London Greyfriars, and a notable survivor during the reign of Queen Mary. Seckford remembered in his will his &quot;loving friend and late son-in-law, William Bowes&quot; – &quot;late&quot;, i.e. former, (stepson) because William&#x27;s mother had died in the previous year, 1586.

==Later career==
===Clerkenwell===
In 1566 Seckford purchased an estate of land in Clerkenwell, Middlesex, consisting of the greater part of a field called St Mary&#x27;s Close, which had belonged to the Benedictine Nunnery of St Mary at Clerkenwell. The nunnery church of St Mary (a modified 12th-century structure) was rededicated as St James&#x27;s parish church at the Reformation. Seckford&#x27;s land was in the area laid out in the 19th century as Sekforde Street and Woodbridge Street, and on this land Seckford built a large house called Woodbridge House, and another which became his own private residence. The latter was near to the residence of his younger brother Sir Henry Sekford, a Groom of the Privy Chamber, who was married to a daughter of Sir Henry Bedingfeld&#x27;s. Other lands in the same immediate neighbourhood had been part of the estate of Clerkenwell Priory, or Hospital of St John of Jerusalem, and in 1573 Queen Elizabeth conveyed three acres, called Bocher or Butt Close, on the west side of the former priory, to Seckford.
In the interim between these two acquisitions he had served in several important commissions and parliamentary committees, beginning with an &quot;oyer and terminer&quot; for Surrey in which Edmund and Arthur Pole were tried for high treason. In 1556 he deliberated on the trial of offences committed within the verge of the Queen&#x27;s household, and in 1570 his commission of oyer and terminer for London encompassed the trial and condemnation of John Felton for his treasonable actions. In 1571 Thomas Wilson replaced Haddon as Seckford&#x27;s fellow Master of Requests, and Seckford was junior Knight of the Shire (MP) for Suffolk, with Sir Owen Hopton: in the following year he was chosen again for Ipswich with Edward Grimston. In 1575 he was appointed &quot;Bailiff, collector and receiver of rents of all manors, messuages and lands which had belonged to the Priory or Hospital of St John of Jerusalem but now in the possession of the Crown in the City of London and the County of Middlesex,&quot; and it is suggested that this position may have facilitated the improvement of his Clerkenwell estate.

Seckford&#x27;s personal integrity became considered as a byword. A short poem of Latin verse was made for Seckford as a compliment by &quot;M. Doctor Norton&quot; (?Thomas Norton), concerning the mutability of all things except virtue, the first letter of each line forming an acrostic on Seckford&#x27;s name. One English version was written by Edmund Withypoll of Ipswich, and another by Gabriel Harvey.

===Saxton&#x27;s patron===

It was by the encouragement and considerable expense of Thomas Seckford that the first County Maps of England produced from an actual Survey were undertaken by Christopher Saxton, during the 1570s. The engraved plates of the completed atlas (dedicated to the Queen), each of which bears the royal arms and those of Thomas Seckford as patron, range in date from 1574 to 1579. By her patent of 1577, Elizabeth granted to Saxton the sole rights to produce maps and atlases for ten years, and introduced the project in this way:&quot;Whereas Christopher Saxton, servaunt to our trustie and wel beloved Thomas Sekeford esquier, master of requestes unto us, hath already (at the greate coste, expenses and charges of his said master) traveyled throughe the greateste parte of this oure realme of England, and hathe to the greate pleasure and comoditie of us, and our lovinge subjectes, uppon the perfecte viewe of a greate nomber of the severall counties, and sheires of oure said realme, drawen oute, and sett forthe, diverse trew and pleasaunt mappes, chartes or platts of the same counties, together with the citties, townes, villages, and ryvers therein conteyned, vearie diligentlie and exactlie donne; and entendithe, yf God graunte hym lief, further to travell therein, throughout all the residue of oure said realme, and so from tyme to tyme to cause the same platts, and discriptions, to be well and fayre ingraven...&quot;

Saxton obtained the services of various engravers, including the Dutch artist Remigius Hogenberg and the Englishman Augustine Ryther (died 1593), so that the work became not only a vast source of information, but also a celebration of English cartography and engraving. Cornelis de Hooghe, who was sometimes based in Ipswich, engraved the first plate of Norfolk in 1574. Seckford was the dedicatee of William Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Description of Scotland&quot; published as a part of his &quot;Description of Britain&quot;, to accompany Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot;: Harrison (1534–1593) thanked him for his &quot;singular curtesie&quot; and help with the description of the rivers and streams of Britain, observing that Seckford&#x27;s good nature &quot;greatly favoureth any thing that is doone for a commoditie unto many,&quot; and called down blessings upon him and upon &quot;my good Lady your Wife&quot;.

===Wards and Liveries===
When Margaret Stanley, Countess of Derby became a possible heir to the throne (following the death of Lady Mary Grey in 1578), in 1579 she was arrested under suspicion of having imagined the Queen&#x27;s death by sorcery, and was detained under house confinement. In a letter of 1580 to Sir Christopher Hatton the Countess mentioned her hopes to move to Clerkenwell: &quot;My cousin Sackford hath built him a house at Clerkenwell, which is not yet thoroughly finished. I would be very gladly his tenant; for the air, as I take it, cannot be much unlike to that of his house at St. John&#x27;s: but I hear now that they die of the sickness round about it...&quot;. In writing a little later to Queen Elizabeth she observed, &quot;But, most dear Sovereign, I confess and acknowledge that I have found great mercy and goodness at your hands, in that, of your merciful consideration you sent me to the house of your Majesty&#x27;s grave officer the Master of Requests, my very good friend and kinsman...&quot;, before being sent on to Isleworth House. The Countess&#x27;s kinship to Seckford lay through the Wingfield side. She is mentioned in Thomas Seckford&#x27;s will, and in the final section of her own will of 1596 made arrangements concerning a house which she had leased from Seckford at Clerkenwell.
In 1579 or 1581 Seckford was appointed Surveyor of the Court of Wards and Liveries, and served under William Cecil (Master of that Court) until his death at Clerkenwell in 1587. As Master of Requests, Seckford is named in 1581 in company with Valentine Dale and David Lewis, and records his title on the Bealings memorial of 1583.

===Seckford memorial 1583===

Thomas Seckford senior of Seckford Hall, father of the benefactor, died in 1575 aged 80, and was buried in the parish church of Great Bealings. Seckford&#x27;s mother, Margaret (Wingfield), had died in 1557 at the age of 64. In 1583 Thomas Seckford, then aged 67, dedicated a memorial to them in that church, with a handsome display of heraldry, to embrace them in the celebration of his own 25 years of service as Master of Requests. It is a composite wall plaque with twin fluted pilasters in flat relief at either side in pale limestone, rising from a register ornamented with panelling beneath, centrally recessed, and with an entablature above bearing inscriptions, surmounted by a projecting pediment with richly dentillated cornices.

At the centre of this composition is a large rectangular carved and painted panel displaying an escutcheon of the arms of Thomas Seckford in their usual quartering, in a strapwork compartment enclosing three rosettes &quot;or&quot;, the helm above crested with the talbot &quot;ermine&quot;, among foliate mantling. The quarterings used by Seckford are those allowed in the 1577 Visitation of Suffolk by Cooke Clarenceux, as follows:
* Seckford: Ermine on a fess gules three escallops or (but here the escallops are argent);

Small painted escutcheons of arms appear dexter (father) and sinister (mother) of the entablature, beside short inscriptions stating their ages and dates of death, and the impalement of the two (representing the marriage) is painted into the tympanum of the pediment.

The inscription reads:&quot;Parentibus suis charissimis, Thomae Sekford de Sekford armigero: et Margaritae uxori eius de filiabus Ioannis Wingfeld de Letheringham militis Thomas Sekford filius Regiae Maiestati, a libellis Supplicum per annos 25 observantiae et pietatis ergo posuit aetatis suae 67, Ano Dni 1583.&quot;&quot;To his beloved parents, Thomas Sekford of Sekford Esquire, and Margaret his wife, one of the daughters of Sir John Wingfield of Letheringham, Kt., their son Thomas Sekford, [being] Master of Requests to the Queen&#x27;s Majesty through 25 years of service and devotion on that account placed [this memorial] in the 67th year of his age, in the year of Our Lord 1583.&quot;

==Seckford&#x27;s Alms-House==
In his last year, Thomas Seckford founded seven almshouses in Woodbridge in 1587, endowed with an income of £112.13s.4d. (£112.66p) per annum from his property in Clerkenwell, Middlesex. The Letters Patent licensing their foundation (as &quot;Seckford&#x27;s Alms-house&quot;) were issued on 23 May 1587 (Elizabeth&#x27;s 29th year). Seckford wrote his ordinances for the almshouses (then &quot;newly-erected&quot;) on 10 July 1587, and the necessary directions and bequests of land to the Governors were expressed in his will dated 1 August 1587. The Governors were incorporated by Patent, to be the Chief Justice of the Court of Bench, and the Lord of the manor of Seckford Hall, if he be an heir-male of Seckford&#x27;s father: or, in default of such heir-male, then the Master of the Rolls. These, with advice of the minister and churchwardens of Woodbridge parish church, were to select the candidates.

A finely-illuminated folio of &quot;Ordinances and statutes made by me, Thomas Sekford esq; the 10th of July, 1587, for the election, admission, exercises, expulsion, and government of 13 poor persons placed in my new-erected alms-houses in Woodbred, in the county of Suffolk&quot; appeared in a library sale of 1763. The text of the vellum manuscript, which came into the possession of the Master of the Rolls, was published in 1792 together with extensive historical notices and a view of the original almshouses.

Built in a single terrace, the almshouses consisted of six houses with attics over, each to be occupied by two poor or infirm unmarried men or widowers, and a seventh similar for the &quot;Principal&quot; almsman to occupy alone (13 in all). Anyone found to have a wife was to be summarily expelled. Each house had its own garden which the occupants were to work for produce, and there was additional land for working, and a fount for water with a yard for washing. The men received a pension paid quarterly, and were provided with cloth for new robes annually, and a silver badge displaying the Seckford arms, so that they were identifiable as they went about the town. They were, of course, to attend services and sermons regularly at St Mary&#x27;s church. Tippling and playing at cards or gaming were forbidden, as was swearing or cursing at one another, and all kinds of lewdness and fornication, which were punishable first by fines deducted from the pensions, and ultimately by expulsion. Three poor widows received a pension and lodgings nearby to attend to and care for the men when they were sick or infirm.

==Death and legacy==

Seckford&#x27;s wife Elizabeth died at Clerkenwell in November 1586, and was buried in the vault of her second husband Sir Martin Bowes at St Mary Woolnoth church. Thomas died at Clerkenwell 19 December 1587, aged 72, and was first buried there: but in accordance with his will his body was afterwards transferred to a vault in a chapel at the north-east side of St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Woodbridge. That chapel is now an organ-chamber: it was the vault, not the chapel itself, which had been constructed by Seckford. His coat of arms, as a quartering with helm and crest within a strapwork oval, appears in original glass in the west window of the north aisle.
The vault was surmounted by a rectangular monument like a table-tomb: from the basal slab (the re-used matrix of an elaborate brass) eight squared and panelled columns arise between three arched openings on either side of the chest, with one arch at each end, leaving the interior space entirely open. Above the columns large consoles project outwards to support the table slab, which overhangs the lower structure. This monument, restored, is now positioned in the most easterly arcade between the chancel and the north-east chapel.

Since Thomas Seckford had no children, at his inquisition post mortem held in 30 Elizabeth (1588) it was found that his nephew Charles Seckford MP (son of Francis Seckford of Seckford Hall, then deceased), was his heir. His will was proved on 3 January 1588, but became the subject of a dispute between Charles and Henry Seckford (a younger brother of Thomas&#x27;s), leading to a Sentence in Charles&#x27;s favour in 1590. Charles died in 1592, and disputes in the Seckford family over the control of the estate continued for many years afterwards.

The informatively heraldic tomb of Thomas Seckford in the chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge, restored, is that of a nephew.

===The Seckford Foundation===

Seckford&#x27;s beneficence is still felt in Woodbridge and Suffolk today. His endowments are managed by Trustees as The Seckford Foundation. The existing almshouses (sometimes called the Seckford Hospital) were built on an adjacent site in 1838–42: they have been very substantially refurbished in modern times and are administered as the Seckford Foundation Almshouses by a sector of the Trust named Seckford Care. The smaller terrace of almshouses near to the entrance of the site stand on the actual site of the original houses.

The almshouse trust was extended in 1861 to include support for the Woodbridge School, which, with the Abbey Junior School, is now maintained by the Foundation, and in 2007 the Seckford Theatre was established in Woodbridge under the same auspices.

In 2012 the Seckford Education Trust (&quot;SET&quot;) was set up by the Foundation: it has opened Secondary Schools at Beccles, Ixworth and Saxmundham, and in 2019 adopted two Primary Schools, the Maidstone Infants School and Causton Junior School, both in Felixstowe. The Foundation also makes individual grants and other benefactions, with a particular focus on education and support for the young, and on care, shelter and support for the elderly.

==Commemoration and popular culture==
===Robert Loder&#x27;s token===

In 1796, at a time when English copper coinage was in poor condition and was augmented by many tradesmen&#x27;s tokens, a one-penny-sized copper Conder token or medalet was issued by R. Loder of Woodbridge, commemorating Thomas Seckford. The obverse showed a bust of Seckford in his hat with the legend &quot;THO SEKFORD ESQ. FOUNDED WOODBRIDGE ALMSHOUSES 1587.&quot;

The reverse showed an escutcheon of Seckford&#x27;s single arms (&quot;ermine on a fess gules 3 escallops argent&quot;) with the legend &quot;AT WHOSE EXPENCE COUNTY MAPS WERE FIRST ENGRAVED 1574.&quot;; within this, in Latin, was &quot;ORATIONES . ET . ELEEMOS . ASCENDUMT . IN . MEMORIAM . CORAM . DEO.&quot; (Prayers and alms rise before God in his memory). This was probably intended to resemble the old badge of the almsmen.

===Streets and inns===
The almshouses occupy a site in Seckford Street, Woodbridge (running between Market Hill and Drybridge Hill), and an inn named The Seckford Arms (now a private house) stood beside the gateway entrance to the site.

Sekforde Street in Clerkenwell, London, is built on land once owned by Thomas Seckford and is named for him. Sekforde Street adjoins Woodbridge Street, laid out at the same time in the 1830s. The Sekforde public house at the corner of Sekforde Street in Clerkenwell has a modified version of the be-hatted portrait for its inn-sign.

In the film &quot;About a Boy&quot; starring Hugh Grant the main character, Will, lives in a flat in No.1 Sekforde Street (actual research shows the temporary movie-set doorway was constructed at 16–18 St James&#x27;s Walk, the same glazed-brick building but around the corner.) Woodbridge Chapel on Woodbridge Street also features in the film as the scene of the &quot;Single Parents Alone Together&quot; (SPAT) meeting.

<text>PETSCII (PET Standard Code of Information Interchange), also known as CBM ASCII, is the character set used in Commodore Business Machines&#x27; 8-bit home computers.

This character set was first used by the PET from 1977, and was subsequently used by the CBM-II, VIC-20, Commodore 64, Commodore 16, Commodore 116, Plus/4, and Commodore 128. However, the Amiga personal computer family instead uses standard ISO/IEC 8859-1.

==History==
The character set was largely designed by Leonard Tramiel (the son of Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel) and PET designer Chuck Peddle. The graphic characters of PETSCII were one of the extensions Commodore specified for Commodore BASIC when laying out desired changes to Microsoft&#x27;s existing 6502 BASIC to Microsoft&#x27;s Ric Weiland in 1977. The VIC-20 used the same pixel-for-pixel font as the PET, although the characters appeared wider due to the VIC&#x27;s 22-column screen. The Commodore 64, however, used a slightly re-designed, heavy upper-case font, essentially a thicker version of the PET&#x27;s, in order to avoid color artifacts created by the machine&#x27;s higher resolution screen. The C64&#x27;s lowercase characters are identical to the lowercase characters in the Atari 8-bit computers font (released 2.75 years earlier).

Peddle claims the inclusion of card suit symbols was spurred by the demand that it should be easy to write card games on the PET (as part of the specification list he received).

==Specifications==
&quot;Unshifted&quot; PETSCII is based on the 1963 version of ASCII (rather than the 1967 version, which most if not all other computer character sets based on ASCII use). It has only uppercase letters, an up-arrow instead of caret at 0x5E and a left-arrow instead of an underscore at 0x5F. In all versions except the original Commodore PET, it also has a British pound sign instead of the backslash at 0x5C. Other characters added in ASCII-1967 (lowercase letters, the grave accent, curly braces, vertical bar, and tilde) do not exist in PETSCII. Codes 0xA0–0xDF are allotted to CBM-specific block graphics characters—horizontal and vertical lines, hatches, shades, triangles, circles and card suits.

PETSCII also has a &quot;shifted&quot; mode (also called &quot;business mode&quot;), which changes the uppercase letters at 0x41–0x5A to lowercase, and changes the graphics at 0xC1–0xDA to uppercase letters. Upper- and lower-case are swapped from where ASCII has them. The mode is toggled by holding one of the SHIFT keys and then pressing and releasing the &quot;Commodore&quot; key. The shift can be done by POKEing location 59468 with the value 14 to select the alternative set or 12 to revert to standard. On the Commodore 64, the sets are alternated by flipping bit 2 of the byte 53272. On some models of PET, this can also be achieved via special control code codice_1 which adjust the line spacing as well as changing the character set; the POKE method is still available and does not alter the line spacing.

Included in PETSCII are cursor and screen control codes, such as codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, and codice_5 (the latter two activating/deactivating reverse-video character display). The control codes appeared in program listings as reverse-video graphic characters, although some computer magazines, in their efforts to provide more clearly readable listings, pretty-printed the codes using their actual names in curly braces, like the above examples. This is unambiguous as PETSCII has no curly brace characters.

Different mappings are used for storing characters (the &quot;interchange&quot; mapping, as used by codice_6) and displaying characters (the &quot;video&quot; mapping). For example, to display the characters &quot;@ABC&quot; on screen by directly writing into the screen memory, one would POKE the decimal values 0, 1, 2, and 3 rather than 64, 65, 66, and 67.

The keyboard by default provides access to the lower half of the code page. Pressing Shift and a key gives the corresponding upper half code point. Some PETSCII code points cannot be printed and are only used for keyboard input (e.g. F1, RUN/STOP).

==Character set==

The tables below represent the &quot;interchange&quot; PETSCII encoding, as used by codice_6.

Control characters are defined in the ranges 0x00–0x1F and 0x80–0x9F, although which control characters are defined and what they are defined as varies between systems. The tables below exclude control characters—the encoding of control characters in discussed in § Control characters.

The ranges 0x60–0x7F and 0xE0–0xFF are duplicate ranges, although what they duplicate varies between systems. On the Commodore PET, they duplicate 0x20–0x3F and 0xA0–0xBF, respectively; on the Commodore VIC-20, 64, 16, and 128 they duplicate 0xC0–0xDF and 0xA0–0xBF, respectively. While these characters are visually duplicates, they are semantically different; for example, on the Commodore PET, code points 0x2C and 0x6C both produce a comma character, but only 0x2C functions as a delimiter between input fields.

Graphic characters are mostly identical across systems, with the exceptions of 0x5C (which is codice_8 on the Commodore PET, and codice_9 on other systems), 0xDE (which is U+1FB95 CHECKER BOARD FILL on the Commodore PET and VIC-20, and U+1FB96 INVERSE CHECKER BOARD FILL on other systems), and the range 0x60–0x7F (which duplicates a different range on Commodore PET). Additionally, in Commodore PET 2001&#x27;s shifted character set, uppercase and lowercase letters are swapped relative to other systems&#x27;.

Compatibility symbols for PETSCII characters were added to Unicode 13.0 as part of the Symbols for Legacy Computing block.&lt;ref name=&quot;L2/19-025&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard===
The following tables represent the PETSCII encoding used on the Commodore VIC-20, 64, 16, and 128.

==Control characters==
While the graphic characters were mostly shared between Commodore systems, the control characters frequently varied. The follow table describes what the control characters represent on the Commodore PET 2001, Commodore PET 8032, VIC-20, Commodore 64, Commodore 16, Commodore 128 (40 and 80 column modes).

The colors of the VIC-20 and C64/128 are listed in the VIC-II article.

==Base 128==

Out of PETSCII&#x27;s first 192 codes, there are 128 graphic characters: 32–127 and 160–192. This permits &quot;base128&quot;-style encodings in DATA statements, or perhaps between PETSCII-speaking machines. This can also include control characters, which are visible when quoted, although which control characters are defined varies between systems.

The primary application for a &quot;Base 128&quot; encoding is in DATA statements in Commodore BASIC. Binary data can be stored with relatively low overhead, allowing one character of data to encode seven bits of data. On a standard 80-character line, typically four characters are used for the line number, and two characters for the tokenized DATA statement. Since the comma and colon are significant to BASIC, a quote character is also needed, leaving 73 characters for data. At seven bits per character, one DATA line could store 511 bits of binary data, for 79% efficiency. If three-digit line numbers are used, efficiency increases to 80%. If two-digit line numbers are used, efficiency is 82%.

For storing binary data in Commodore BASIC, it appears that two- or three-digit line numbers are typically the best choice.

===Base 164===
164 PETSCII characters are representable in quoted strings; theoretically, then, Base 164 is possible. This adds in the color values, the function keys, and cursor controls.

<doc id="469052" wikidata="Q1047918" url="?curid=469052" title="New Mutants">
<text>The New Mutants are a group of fictional mutant superheroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, generally in association with the X-Men. Originally depicted as the teenaged junior class at the Xavier Institute, subsequent stories have depicted the characters as adult superheroes (in their eponymous series as well as in related titles such as &quot;X-Force&quot; and &quot;The Avengers&quot;) or as teachers and mentors to younger mutants.

The team first appeared in &quot;The New Mutants&quot; (September 1982) by Chris Claremont and artist Bob McLeod, part of the &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; line, followed by the ongoing series &quot;The New Mutants&quot; which ran from 1983 until 1991. Like the &quot;X-Men&quot; parent title, also written by Claremont, &quot;The New Mutants&quot; featured an ensemble cast, with stories often focused on interpersonal relationships and coming-of-age arcs, blending teen drama with action and adventure. The title was taken over by writer Louise Simonson, ultimately taking a more action-oriented focus under artist Rob Liefeld, who relaunched the characters as X-Force following the series&#x27; end.

Since their inception, several &quot;New Mutants&quot; series have been published, either focusing on the continuing adventures of the original lineup, new groups of young mutants, or some combination of both. Individual characters have appeared in various film, television, and other media adaptations of the X-Men franchise, while most of the original lineup of the New Mutants was featured in the 2020 20th Century Studios horror film of the same name.

== Original run ==
By the early 1980s, &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; (under the authorship of Chris Claremont) had become one of the comic book industry&#x27;s most successful titles, prompting Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter to launch &quot;The New Mutants&quot;, the first of several &quot;X-Men&quot; spin-offs. &quot;X-Men&quot; editor Louise Simonson recalled &quot;Neither Chris [Claremont] or I really wanted to do it. We wanted &quot;X-Men&quot; to be special and by itself, but Shooter told us that if we didn&#x27;t come up with a new &#x27;mutant&#x27; book, someone else would.&quot; The name was a modification of Stan Lee&#x27;s original name for the X-Men, &quot;The Mutants&quot;.

The New Mutants were teenaged students of Professor Charles Xavier&#x27;s School for Gifted Youngsters and wore matching uniforms, much like the original X-Men, who had since grown into adulthood. These students resembled the &quot;all-new, all-different X-Men&quot; of their era in terms of ethnic diversity.

The original team consisted of:

* Cannonball (Samuel Guthrie), a mild-mannered 16-year-old coal miner&#x27;s son from Kentucky, United States and eventual co-leader, with the ability to generate thermo-chemical energy and propel himself through the air, during which he is invulnerable.
* Karma (Mạnh Cao Xuân), a 19-year-old girl from Vietnam and the team&#x27;s original leader, who could mentally possess other people&#x27;s minds.
* Mirage (Danielle Moonstar, originally codenamed Psyche), a Cheyenne Native American girl and eventual co-leader after Karma&#x27;s apparent death, who could create visual empathic three-dimensional illusions.
* Sunspot (Roberto da Costa), a 14-year-old boy from Brazil who had superhuman strength fueled by sunlight and could store solar energy in his body to use his super strength.
* Wolfsbane (Rahne Sinclair), a 13-year-old Presbyterian girl from Scotland, United Kingdom who could transform into a wolf and a werewolf-like creature.

The team was intended to debut in their own series. As the first issue was nearing completion, Shooter ordered it to be reworked into a graphic novel so that &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; could make its deadline for the next issue. Thus, the New Mutants debuted in &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; #4 (December 1982), which continued a plotline from &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;. (Despite this, the graphic novel missed its shipping slot by two weeks due to artist Bob McLeod&#x27;s honeymoon.)

In addition to very serious depictions of teenage angst and growing pains, the series featured themes of mysticism. The stories also relied on wilder, more far-fetched premises than were typical of &quot;X-Men&quot; at the time, shaping into more of a science fiction and fantasy series than the superhero coming-of-age comic it had been touted as in its early days. Locales included demonic dimensions, alternate futures, and an ancient Roman civilization hidden within the Amazon rainforest. The New Mutants also encountered a secret society called the Hellfire Club, and began a rivalry with their young apprentices, the Hellions.

Karma was dropped from the series after six issues under initially unclear circumstances. &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #6 ends on a cliffhanger as the building the New Mutants are in explodes, but issue #7 skips ahead several days and opens with the New Mutants grieving the missing Karma, with no explanation for how she was lost. It was not until a flashback by Sunspot in issue #10 that Karma&#x27;s absence was explained. Adding further to the confusion, while Karma was dropped from the series head roster for the cover of issue #7, she returned to the head roster on the covers of issues #8 and 9, even though she was still gone. After the apparent death of Karma, Cannonball and Dani Moonstar act as co-leaders. New recruits included:

* Cypher (Douglas Ramsey), an otherwise ordinary young man who could learn to read or speak any language rapidly, whether it was human, alien, or machine, making him an unmatched computer expert.
* Magik (Illyana Rasputina), younger sister of the Russian X-Man Colossus and long-time resident of the X-Mansion, an accomplished mystic who could open &quot;teleportation discs&quot; allowing travel to Limbo and from there, any point on Earth.
* Magma (Amara Juliana Olivians Aquilla), a fiercely tempered native of a secret Roman society in the Amazon who can control lava.
* Warlock, an extraterrestrial of the techno-organic race known as the Technarchy. Considered a pariah due to the uncommon trait of empathy.

A supplementary &quot;New Mutants Annual&quot; series began in 1984. These annuals were always written by whoever was the regular &quot;New Mutants&quot; writer at the time and often included significant changes to the status quo. These changes were not explained in the parent series, so that readers would have to buy &quot;New Mutants Annual&quot; to follow events in both series. Annual #1 featured the first appearance of Cannonball&#x27;s love interest, rock musician Lila Cheney, and was drawn by McLeod. The 1985 annual, which was solicited as &quot;New Mutants Annual&quot; #2 but published as &quot;New Mutants Special Edition&quot; #1 because it exceeded the maximum page count for an annual, saw Mirage inducted into the Valkyrior and Cypher and Warlock merging into one body for the first time. A 1987 issue of &quot;Comics Feature&quot; called &quot;New Mutants Special Edition&quot; #1 &quot;the single finest New Mutants tale to date and one of the best comics published in the past decade&quot;, citing Claremont&#x27;s penchant for fantasy, artist Arthur Adams&#x27;s depiction of Warlock, and the strong individual development of all the characters. Annual #2 (1986) featured the first American appearance of Psylocke; it along with Annual #3 (1987) was drawn by Alan Davis. The 1988 (#4) Annual saw Mirage&#x27;s powers dramatically enhanced so that she created physical manifestations of people&#x27;s fears and desires rather than illusions. The 1989 Annual (#5) covers the New Mutants&#x27; return to Earth after a lengthy stay in Asgard in the main series. The 1990 Annual (#6) was part of the &quot;Days of Future Present&quot; crossover. It also featured the first appearance (in pin-up form) of Shatterstar, as part of a planned line-up change preview that was ultimately discarded when Louise Simonson left the series. Annual #7 was the last issue of the series.

Furthermore, in 1990, Ann Nocenti and Brett Blevins produced an 80 page issue called &quot;New Mutants Summer Special&quot;. The special saw several New Mutants (Boom Boom, Wolfsbane, Sunspot, and Warlock) dragged into a world of television, which served as a vehicle for Nocenti to discuss mass media theory.

In 1986, Professor X was written out of the series. Before he left, he made the X-Men&#x27;s one-time nemesis, Magneto, headmaster of his school. Magneto would be the team&#x27;s longest-running headmaster, holding the position from &quot;New Mutants&quot; #35 through to #75. Fiercely overprotective of his students, particularly after the events of the &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; and &quot;Fall of the Mutants&quot;, he was increasingly used as an uptight foil for the adventurous New Mutants, setting rules that they would inevitably break in the interests of helping their friends.

During Simonson&#x27;s run, Magma is written out of the book, and Magik is de-aged back to childhood. Due to his unpopularity with New Mutants readers and artists, Cypher is killed off in &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #60 (February 1988). Simonson recalled, &quot;He wasn&#x27;t fun to draw. He just stood around and hid behind a tree during a fight... Every artist who ever did him said &#x27;Can&#x27;t we kill this guy?&#x27; We would get letters from fans about how much they hated him.&quot; Simonson also folded the X-Terminators, a group of young wards from &quot;X-Factor&quot;, into the New Mutants.

The X-Terminators added to the team were:

* Boom-Boom (Tabitha Smith), a teen runaway who could create &quot;plasma bombs.&quot;
* Rusty Collins, a pyrokinetic wanted by the U.S. government.
* Rictor (Julio Richter), a young Mexican who could create shock waves.
* Skids (Sally Blevins), a former Morlock who could project a frictionless force field around her body.

In 1989, Simonson crafted a saga in which the team journeyed to Asgard, the home of the gods of Norse mythology. The storyline wrote Dani Moonstar out of the series, as she joined the Norse pantheon as one of the Valkyrior. Titled &quot;Instant Replay!&quot;, the story in New Mutants #64 deals with the New Mutants&#x27; mourning for Cypher, and includes a scene in which Warlock attempts to resurrect Cypher by taking his corpse out of its coffin and showing it to Cypher&#x27;s loved ones. Simonson holds it to be her favorite New Mutants story, though she acknowledges that many readers found it too morbid.

A new mentor for the group, the mysterious mercenary Cable, was introduced. Over the next year, several longtime team members were written out or killed off. When Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza took over as writers of the final three issues of the series, they included several harder-edged characters:

* &quot;Domino&quot; (Vanessa Geraldine Carlysle), Cable&#x27;s pale-skinned, black-garbed mercenary lover. Actually Copycat, impersonating Domino.
* Feral (Maria Callasantos), who possessed a bestial temperament and appearance.
* Shatterstar (Gaveedra Seven), a swashbuckling warrior from another dimension.
* Warpath (James Proudstar), the younger brother of slain X-Man Thunderbird and a former Hellion, an Apache who possessed super strength and speed.

&quot;The New Mutants&quot; was cancelled in 1991 with issue #100, but the new platoon-like team formed by Cable continued in &quot;X-Force&quot;. That team featured a variety of the former &quot;New Mutants&quot; cast.

==Critical response==
Literary scholar Ramzi Fawaz emphasizes the significance of the original run. He argues that in contrast to the original X-Men stories, &quot;New Mutants&quot; &quot;radically reassesses the concept of the &#x27;mutant superhero.&#x27;&quot; For example, Fawaz writes that mutant powers are re-envisioned as traumatic experiences of shame. He argues that this is a response to the fragmentation of social liberation movements in the 1980s. He writes that &quot;Like the social movements of the 1980s that destabilized instrumentalist understandings of politics, &quot;The New Mutants&quot; recast the figure of the superhero as a contingent political actor detached from an assumed role as a purveyor of liberal ideals.&quot;

== New X-Men: Academy X ==
The second incarnation of the &quot;New Mutants&quot; debuted in 2003 with an ongoing series of the same name, written by Nunzio DeFilippis and Christina Weir. The series would continue for 13 issues, until June 2004, before being relaunched as &quot;New X-Men: Academy X&quot; in July 2004, with a new #1.

The series featured a handful of the dozens of mutant teenagers attending the Xavier Institute, as well as their instructors, which included various X-Men as well as former members of the original New Mutants (Karma, Magma, Dani Moonstar, and Wolfsbane).

The featured group of students never refer to themselves as &quot;the New Mutants&quot; before the series relaunch as &quot;New X-Men: Academy X&quot; in 2004, and the reorganization of the Xavier Institute student body into various training squads. The New Mutants, advised by Dani Moonstar, were:

* Elixir (Josh Foley) – Josh is an Omega-Level mutant who can manipulate his or others&#x27; biologies to heal or harm. In addition, Elixir possesses gold skin which converts to black when he uses his powers offensively. He was one of the 27 students at the Xavier Institute to retain his powers after &quot;M-Day&quot;. He was seemingly killed by the Dark Riders before returning with vastly enhanced abilities.
* Icarus (Joshua &quot;Jay&quot; Guthrie) – Jay possesses red angelic wings on his back that allow him to fly and which grant him an accelerated healing process. Furthermore, he possesses the ability to manipulate his own voice. He was one of the 27 students at the Xavier Institute to retain his powers after &quot;M-Day&quot;. Jay&#x27;s wings are amputated by Stryker, who later kills him.
* Prodigy (David Alleyne) – David was the team&#x27;s co-leader who could temporarily gain the knowledge and skills of those near him. Although he was de-powered after &quot;M-Day&quot;, he has retained all the knowledge he had acquired prior to the &quot;Decimation&quot;.
* Surge (Noriko Ashida) – Noriko is Japanese. She absorbs electricity from her environment which she can discharge as powerful electric blasts or utilize as superhuman speed. She requires mechanical gauntlets to prevent overcharge. Surge was one of the 27 students at the Xavier Institute to retain her powers after &quot;M-Day&quot;.
* Wallflower (Laurie Collins) – Laurie is a shy girl who generates highly potent pheromones that influence people&#x27;s emotions. She was one of the 27 students at the Xavier Institute to retain her powers after &quot;M-Day&quot;. Laurie was later killed by one of Stryker&#x27;s men.
* Wind Dancer (Sofia Mantega) – Sofia was the other co-leader and was a temperamental aerokinetic who was particularly adept at using this power to manipulate sound. She was depowered after &quot;M-Day&quot; and joined a group of fellow ex-mutants as part of the New Warriors. Donning a variety of mechanical gear, she took up the codename Renascence before the group disbanded.
* Wither (Kevin Ford) – Kevin could cause organic material to decay with his touch. He eventually switches to the Hellions squad. He is later killed by Elixir.

Another such group, advised by Emma Frost, was known as the Hellions and, like their predecessor, was the arch-rival of the New Mutants. Whereas the original &quot;New Mutants&quot; series revolved around battles with world-threatening menaces, &quot;New Mutants&quot; volume 2 focused on the characters&#x27; personal relationships and struggles with controlling their powers.

After &quot;M-Day&quot;, the cataclysmic event that decimated the world&#x27;s mutant population, only 27 of the 182 students enrolled at the Xavier Institute retained their powers. The New Mutants and the other training squads were disbanded, and the remaining students were folded into a single junior team, the New X-Men.

== Original team reunion ==
In May 2009, a third volume of &quot;New Mutants&quot; was launched. The team is a reunion of the cast from the first volume, consisting of Cannonball, Karma, Magik, Magma, Dani Moonstar and Sunspot.

The reunion is spun from events from the limited series &quot;X-Infernus&quot;. Magik shows up at the X-Men headquarters in San Francisco, claiming to be from the future and warning that Dani Moonstar and Karma are in danger. Once tests show that Illyanna is not an imposter, Cannonball leads a rescue mission with her. They are joined by Magma and Sunspot. They end up taking on Legion.

In later issue, Warlock returns to Earth and Cypher reappears alive, under the control of Selene. After Warlock frees him from Selene&#x27;s control, Cypher joins the team.

During &quot;Siege&quot;, Hela empowers Dani (now going by the codename Mirage) as a Valkyrie to bring the souls of the fallen Asgardians to her. During &quot;X-Men: Second Coming&quot;, Karma loses her leg after being repeatedly stabbed by Cameron Hodge. It is replaced with a bionic one.

Magik leads the team to Limbo, as part of her plan for revenge against the Elder Gods. Cyclops has her imprisoned for her actions. In the same issue, Cannonball and Karma also leave the team.

After they successfully rescue him from Sugar Man, Nate Grey joins the team.

When the X-Men split in &quot;X-Men: Schism&quot;, the team sides with Cyclops and stays on Utopia. Their next mission is to find Blink. After locating her and helping her defeat a mutant rock band (Diskhord), Blink returns with them but decides to join the X-Men at the Jean Grey School of Higher Learning. She does join them during the last issues of the series.

==Krakoan era==
&quot;New Mutants&quot; was relaunched in November 2019 as part of Dawn of X. The initial team consisted of Chamber, Cypher, Karma, Magik, Mirage, Mondo, Sunspot and Wolfsbane. A second team comprising Armor, Boom Boom, Glob, Maxime and Manon debuted in issue #3 (December 2019).

Later issues were featuring older New Mutants Karma, Magik, Mirage, Warlock, Warpath, and Wolfsbane acting as teachers and mentors to a new group of younger students known as the Lost Club. This new group of students (which includes Anole, Scout, Rain Boy, Cosmar, and No-Girl) falls under the influence of, and later into conflict with the Shadow King, culminating in an adventure through the astral plane.

== New Mutants members ==

In 1982, the original New Mutants team debuted in &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; #4. Originally led by Professor X, and later by Magneto, the lineup gradually expanded to include additional recruits, with subsequent volumes and titles have features a variety of team members and associated characters.



== Other versions ==
=== &quot;Rahne of Terra&quot; ===
The graphic novel &quot;Rahne of Terra,&quot; by Peter David, is set in a heroic fantasy universe in which Wolfsbane&#x27;s counterpart is Princess Rain of Geshem. Other denizens of Terra include Rain&#x27;s lady-in-waiting Tabby (Boom-Boom), the knights Richard (Rictor), Robert (Sunspot), and Samuel (Cannonball) and the peasant boy Douglas (Cypher). The Terrans all duplicate the powers of their counterparts in one way or another.

=== &quot;New Mutants: Truth or Death&quot; ===
In 1997, a three-issue reunion series written by Ben Raab and illustrated by Bernard Chang, &quot;New Mutants: Truth or Death,&quot; featured the young New Mutants traveling forward in time to meet their older, jaded selves in X-Force.

===Worst X-Man Ever===
Here the New Mutants consist of X-Ceptional, who can explode permanently, Riches, who turns whatever he touches to gold, Minerva, who can manipulate reality, and Riches&#x27; sister Rags. Riches kills Professor X and takes over the world. Rags begins a relationship with Gambit, and Minerva goes to pure idea. X-Ceptional grabs Riches and explodes, killing them both.

=== Ultimate Marvel ===
In &quot;Ultimate X-Men,&quot; the Academy of Tomorrow (previously called New Mutants) is founded by Emma Frost. It is loosely linked to the X-Men via Emma Frost&#x27;s professional relationship with her former lover and teacher Charles Xavier. This Academy accepts any talented students, regardless of their genetic status. The team is headed by a non-telepathic and more pacifistic version of Emma Frost and headed by field leader Havok. During &quot;Ultimatum&quot;, the Academy of Tomorrow is destroyed in a terrorist attack by Multiple Man. Former members include Angel, Beast, Cannonball, Dazzler, Karma, Northstar, Polaris, Sunspot and non-mutant Cypher.

== In other media ==
===Television===
The New Mutants, based on the first comics incarnation, appear in &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot;, consisting of Boom-Boom, Cannonball, Magma, Sunspot, Wolfsbane, Berzerker, Iceman, Jubilee, and Multiple.

===Film===
A self-titled film adaptation of the New Mutants was released on August 28, 2020. The film was directed by Josh Boone, with a script written by Boone and Knate Gwaltney, and stars Maisie Williams as Rahne Sinclair / Wolfsbane, Anya Taylor-Joy as Illyana Rasputin / Magik, Charlie Heaton as Sam Guthrie / Cannonball, Blu Hunt as Dani Moonstar / Mirage, and Henry Zaga as Bobby da Costa / Sunspot.

<text>David Rowland Langford (born 10 April 1953) is a British author, editor, and critic, largely active within the science fiction field. He publishes the science-fiction fanzine and newsletter &quot;Ansible&quot; and holds the all-time record for most Hugo Awards, with a total of 29 wins.

==Personal background==
David Langford was born and grew up in Newport, Wales, before studying for a degree in Physics at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he first became involved in science fiction fandom. Langford is married to Hazel and is the older brother of the musician and artist Jon Langford.

His first job was as a weapons physicist at the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston, Berkshire from 1975 to 1980. In 1985 he set up a &quot;tiny and informally run software company&quot; with science fiction writer Christopher Priest, called Ansible Information after Langford&#x27;s news-sheet. The company has ceased trading.

Langford has worn a hearing aid since childhood, and increasing hearing difficulties have reduced Langford&#x27;s participation in some fan activities. His own jocular attitude towards the matter led to a 2003 chapbook anthology of his work being titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Hear It for the Deaf Man&quot;.

==Literary career==
===Fiction===
As a writer of fiction, Langford is noted for his parodies. A collection of short stories, parodying various science fiction, fantasy fiction and detective story writers, has been published as &quot;He Do the Time Police in Different Voices&quot; (2003), incorporating the earlier and much shorter 1988 parody collection &quot;The Dragonhiker&#x27;s Guide to Battlefield Covenant at Dune&#x27;s Edge: Odyssey Two&quot;. Two novels, parodying disaster novels and horror, respectively, are &quot;Earthdoom!&quot; and &quot;Guts&quot;, both co-written with John Grant.
His novelette &quot;An Account of a Meeting with Denizens of Another World, 1871&quot;, published in 1979, is an account of a UFO encounter, as experienced by a Victorian; in its framing story Langford claims to have found the manuscript in an old desk (the story&#x27;s narrator, William Robert Loosley, is a genuine ancestor of Langford&#x27;s wife) and he analyses the story from a modern perspective, highlighting apparent descriptions of nuclear physics and quantum mechanics in Loosley&#x27;s record. This has led some UFOlogists to believe the story is genuine, including the US author Whitley Strieber, who referred to the 1871 incident in his novel &quot;Majestic&quot;. Langford wrote the story as a spoof at the suggestion of his publisher and says that since publication he has always admitted the story to be fictional when asked — but, as he notes, &quot;Journalists usually didn&#x27;t ask.&quot;

Langford also had one serious science fiction novel published in 1982, &quot;The Space Eater&quot;. The 1984 novel &quot;The Leaky Establishment&quot; satirises the author&#x27;s experiences at Aldermaston. His 2004 collection &quot;Different Kinds of Darkness&quot; is a compilation of 36 of his shorter, non-parodic science fiction pieces, the title story of which won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story in 2001.

====Basilisks====
A number of Langford&#x27;s stories are set in a future containing images, colloquially called &quot;basilisks&quot;, which crash the human mind by triggering thoughts that the mind is physically or logically incapable of thinking. The first of these stories was &quot;BLIT&quot; (&quot;Interzone&quot;, 1988); others include &quot;What Happened at Cambridge IV&quot; (&quot;Digital Dreams&quot;, 1990); &quot;comp.basilisk FAQ&quot;, and the Hugo-winning &quot;Different Kinds of Darkness&quot; (&quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, 2000).

The idea has appeared elsewhere; in one of his novels, Ken MacLeod has characters explicitly mention (and worry about encountering) the &quot;Langford Visual Hack&quot;. Similar references, also mentioning Langford by name, feature in works by Greg Egan and Charles Stross. The eponymous &quot;Snow Crash&quot; of Neal Stephenson&#x27;s novel is a combination mental/computer virus capable of infecting the minds of hackers via their visual cortex. The idea also appears in &quot;Blindsight&quot; by Peter Watts where a particular combination of right angles is a harmful image to vampires. The roleplaying game &quot;Eclipse Phase&quot; has so-called &quot;Basilisk hacks&quot;, sensory or linguistic attacks on cognitive processes. The concept of a &quot;cognitohazard&quot;, largely identical to Langford&#x27;s basilisks, is sometimes used in the fictional universe of the SCP Foundation.

The image&#x27;s name comes from the basilisk, a legendary reptile said to have the power to cause death with a single glance.

===Non-fiction and editorial work===
Langford has won numerous Hugo Awards for his activities as a fan journalist on his free newsletter &quot;Ansible&quot;, which he has described as &quot;The SF &quot;Private Eye&quot;. The name is taken from Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s science-fictional communication device. The newsletter first appeared in August 1979. Fifty issues were published by 1987, when it entered a hiatus. Since resuming publication in 1991, &quot;Ansible&quot; has appeared monthly (with occasional extra issues given &quot;half&quot; numbers, e.g. &quot;Ansible 53&quot;) as a two-sided A4 sheet and latterly also online. A digest has appeared as the &quot;Ansible Link&quot; column in &quot;Interzone&quot; since issue 62, August 1992. The complete archive of &quot;Ansible&quot; is available at Langford&#x27;s personal website. &quot;Ansible&quot; issue 300 was published on 2 July 2012.

&quot;Ansible&quot; has for many years advertised that paper copies are available for various unlikely items such as &quot;SAE, Fwai-chi shags or Rhune Books of Deeds&quot;. In 1996, Ursula K. Le Guin wrote: &quot;Tell me what I can send in exchange for &quot;Ansible&quot;. In Oregon we grow many large fir trees; also we have fish.&quot;

Langford wrote the science fiction and fantasy book review column for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; from 1983 to 1988, continuing in other British role-playing game magazines until 1991; the columns are collected as &quot;The Complete Critical Assembly&quot; (2001). He has also written a regular column for the &quot;SFX&quot; magazine, featuring in every issue from its launch in 1995 to #274 dated July 2016. A tenth-anniversary collection of these columns appeared in 2005 as &quot;The SEX Column and other misprints&quot;; this was shortlisted for a 2006 Hugo Award for Best Related Book. Further &quot;SFX&quot; columns are collected in &quot;Starcombing: columns, essays, reviews and more&quot; (2009), which also includes much other material written since 2000.

David Langford has also written columns for several computer magazines, notably &quot;8000 Plus&quot; (later renamed &quot;PCW Plus&quot;), which was devoted to the Amstrad PCW word processor. This column ran, though not continuously, from the first issue in October 1986 to the last, dated Christmas 1996; it was revived in the small-press magazine &quot;PCW Today&quot; from 1997 to 2002, and all the columns are collected as &quot;The Limbo Files&quot; (2009). Langford&#x27;s 1985–1988 &quot;The Disinformation Column&quot; for &quot;Apricot File&quot; was about Apricot Computers systems; these columns are collected as &quot;The Apricot Files&quot; (2007).

A collection of nonfiction and humorous work, &quot;Let&#x27;s Hear It for the Deaf Man&quot;, was published in 1992 by NESFA Press. This was incorporated into a follow-up collection, consisting of 47 nonfiction pieces and three short stories, and published as &quot;The Silence of the Langford&quot; in 1996. &quot;Up Through an Empty House of Stars&quot; (2003) is a further collection of one hundred reviews and essays.

Much of Langford&#x27;s early book-length publication was futurological in nature. &quot;War in 2080: The Future of Military Technology&quot;, published in 1979, and &quot;The Third Millennium: A History of the World AD 2000-3000&quot; (1985), jointly written with fellow science fiction author Brian Stableford, are two examples. Both these authors also worked with Peter Nicholls on &quot;The Science in Science Fiction&quot; (1982). Within the broader field of popular non-fiction, Langford co-wrote &quot;Facts and Fallacies: a Book of Definitive Mistakes and Misguided Predictions&quot; (1984) with Chris Morgan.

Langford assisted in producing the second edition of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; (1993) and contributed some 80,000 words of articles to &quot;The Encyclopedia of Fantasy&quot; (1997). He is one of the four chief editors of the third, online edition of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; (launched October 2011), and shared this reference work&#x27;s 2012 Hugo Award for Best Related Work. He has also edited a book of John Sladek&#x27;s uncollected work, published in 2002 as &quot;Maps: The Uncollected John Sladek&quot;. Langford&#x27;s critical introduction to &quot;Maps&quot; won a BSFA Award for nonfiction. With Christopher Priest, Langford also set up Ansible E-ditions (now Ansible Editions) which publishes other print-on-demand collections of short stories by Sladek and David I. Masson; essays and review columns by Brian Aldiss, Algis Budrys, Peter Nicholls and again Sladek; and ebooks of historical interest to science fiction fandom, downloadable at no charge from the Trans-Atlantic Fan Fund site.

Excluding collections, Langford&#x27;s most recent professionally published book is &quot;The End of Harry Potter?&quot; (2006), an unauthorised companion to the famous series by J. K. Rowling. The work was published after the publication of the sixth volume in the Harry Potter series, but before publication of the seventh and final volume. It contains information, extracted from the books and from Rowling&#x27;s many public statements, about the wizarding world and popular theories concerning how the plot will develop in the last book. A revised version was published in the US in March 2007 by Tor Books, and in paperback form in the UK in May 2007. The book was commissioned from Langford by Malcolm Edwards of Orion Books, who were seeking a book about the Harry Potter series.

Since 2011 he has devoted most of his time to &quot;Ansible&quot;, Ansible Editions and &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot;.

He has been a guest of honour at Boskone, Eastercon twice, Finncon, Microcon three times, Minicon (see List of past Minicons), Novacon, OryCon twice, Picocon several times, and Worldcon (see List of Worldcons).

==Awards==
Langford holds the all-time record for most Hugo Awards, with a total of 29 wins. He has won 21 Hugos for Best Fan Writer, five for &quot;Ansible&quot; as Best Fanzine, another for &quot;Ansible&quot; as Best Semiprozine, one for &quot;Different Kinds of Darkness&quot; as Best Short Story, and one for &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; as Best Related Work. Langford also has the second highest number of Hugo nominations at 55 (behind Mike Glyer at 57). He had a 19-year winning streak and 31-year streak of nominations for &quot;Best Fan Writer&quot; that came to an end in 2010.

<doc id="469060" wikidata="Q1036275" url="?curid=469060" title="Ryo Kase">
<text>is a Japanese actor.

==Early life==
Kase was born in Yokohama, Kanagawa prefecture. He moved to Bellevue, Washington in the United States soon after his birth, due to his father&#x27;s job being transferred.
His father Yutaka Kase, was former chairman and representative director of Sojitz, a major Japanese general trading company.

==Career==
Kase made his screen debut in Sogo Ishii&#x27;s &quot;&quot; in 2000.

That same year, Kase received his major break when he starred in the critically acclaimed film &quot;I Just Didn&#x27;t Do It&quot; (2007), directed by Masayuki Suo, for which he won the Best Actor Award at the 31st Japan Academy Prize and the 2nd Asia Film Award, among other domestic and international film awards.

In 2010, Kase played a &quot;yakuza&quot; mobster in Takeshi Kitano’s highly anticipated return to the crime genre Outrage (アウトレイジ, &quot;Autoreiji&quot;) which competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. The film was a major success,  grossing 634 million yen at the Japan Box office, leading to two sequels. 

In 2023, Kase reunited with Takeshi Kitano in the Japanese film &quot;Kubi&quot; about the Honnō-ji Incident. In the film, Kase portrayed the historical figure, Oda Nobunaga, a charismatic military leader revered and feared as a demon king in Japan. His wildly mad-like performance was highly praised by many journalists at the Cannes Film Festival. In Japan, this portrayal of Nobunaga, which diverges greatly from his public image of being cold yet violent but also deeply human and virtuous, has sparked debate. Some audience members felt that the character setting demeaned the historical figure, while others believed the acting was so realistic it seemed to overwrite the actual image of Nobunaga himself. When director Takeshi Kitano shared this original idea with the late director Akira Kurosawa, he was told that if Kitano were to make it, it could become a masterpiece on par with &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;. This work won several awards at the 47th Japan Academy Prize, including Excellence in Cinematography, Excellence in Lighting, Excellence in Art Direction, Excellence in Sound Recording, and Excellence in Editing. Ryo Kase, who played Nobunaga, also won the award for Excellent Supporting Actor.

=== International Films ===
From the beginning of his career, Kase took advantage of his English fluency and participated in international films from various countries in Asia, Europe, and America.

His first American film was Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) directed by Clint Eastwood, where he delicately portrayed a complex character of a former military policeman turned young soldier. He made his Cannes Film Festival debut with Abbas Kiarostami&#x27;s Like Someone in Love (2012). He has also appeared in Michel Gondry&#x27;s Tokyo! (2008), Gus Van Sant&#x27;s Restless (2011) with Mia Wasikowska, Hong Sang-soo&#x27;s Hill of Freedom (2014), and Martin Scorsese&#x27;s Silence (2016). In Paul Weitz&#x27;s Bel Canto, he starred alongside Julianne Moore and Ken Watanabe. In the film Minamata, inspired by a photo collection of Japan&#x27;s pollution lawsuit taken by the late photographer Eugene Smith, he co-starred with Johnny Depp and Hiroyuki Sanada. In 2014, when Hong Sang-soo&#x27;s Hill of Freedom was released, he was selected as the Best Actor by CINE21, a Korean film magazine, despite being a foreigner. In Kiyoshi Kurosawa&#x27;s To the Ends of the Earth (2019), he won the Best Supporting Actor award at the 14th Asia Film Awards.

<text>Synaptic is a GTK-based graphical user interface designed for the APT package manager used by the Debian Linux distribution and its derivatives. Synaptic is usually used on systems based on deb packages but can also be used on systems based on RPM packages. It can be used to install, remove and upgrade software packages and to add repositories.

==Usage==
The package manager enables the user to install, to upgrade or to remove software packages. To install or remove a package a user must search or navigate to the package, then mark it for installation or removal. Changes are not applied instantly; the user must first mark all changes and then apply them.

==History==
Synaptic development was funded by the Brazilian company Conectiva, which asked Alfredo Kojima, then an employee, to write a graphical front-end for APT, continuing the work initiated with the creation of the APT RPM back-end, apt-rpm.

<text>The Amur bitterling (Rhodeus sericeus) is a small fish of the carp family. It is sometimes just called &quot;bitterling&quot;, which dates back to the time when the European bitterling (&quot;Rhodeus amarus&quot;) was still considered conspecific with &quot;R. sericeus&quot;, and &quot;bitterling&quot; properly refers to any species in entire genus &quot;Rhodeus&quot;. The Amur bitterling is found in Siberia, while the European bitterling is found from European Russia westwards.

Mussels form an essential part of its reproductive system, with bitterling eggs being laid inside them. Long thought to be symbiotic with the mussels (whose larval phase attaches to fish gills during development), recent research has indicated they are in fact parasitic, with co-evolution being seen in Chinese bitterling and mussel species.

Bitterlings usually reside in areas with dense plant growth. They are hardy fish, and can survive in water that is not very well oxygenated. They grow to be long at most. The bitterling&#x27;s diet consists of plant material and small larvae of insects.

== Colour variation ==
Transparent scale variants of bitterlings occur, though not commonly, and are exploited in the aquarium trade.

<text>Rhodeus is a genus of freshwater ray-finned fishes belonging to the family Acheilognathidae, the bitterlings. The scientific name is derived from the Greek word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;rose&quot;. Most species in the genus are restricted to Asia, but two species are found in Europe (&quot;R. amarus&quot; and &quot;R. meridionalis&quot;).

Bitterlings are short-lived species, generally surviving only about five years. Their maximum size is 11 cm, but they are usually much shorter. Bitterlings inhabit slow-flowing or still waters, such as ponds, lakes, marshes, muddy and sandy pools, and river backwaters. Because they depend on freshwater mussels to reproduce, their range is restricted. Bitterlings are omnivorous, feeding on both invertebrates and plants.

Bitterlings have a remarkable reproduction strategy where parents transfer responsibility for the care of their young to various species of freshwater mussels (Unionidae and Margaritiferidae). The female extends her long ovipositor into the mantle cavity of the mussel and deposits her eggs between the gill filaments. The male then ejects his sperm into the mussel&#x27;s inhalent water current and fertilization takes place within the gills of the host. The same female may use a number of mussels, and she deposits only one or two yellow, oval eggs into each. Early developmental stages are protected from predation within the body of the mussel. After 3 to 4 weeks, larvae swim away from the hosts to continue life on their own.

In 1936, the bitterling was thought to respond to hormones in a pregnant woman&#x27;s urine, but the work was later discredited.

==Species==
This genus and &quot;Acheilognathus&quot; have a convoluted taxonomic history, one being at times included in the other. They are now considered separate, but some species formerly in &quot;Rhodeus&quot; are now in &quot;Acheilognathus&quot;.

These are the currently recognized species in this genus:
* &quot;Rhodeus albomarginatus&quot; 
* &quot;Rhodeus amarus&quot; (European bitterling)
* &quot;Rhodeus amurensis&quot; 
* &quot;Rhodeus atremius&quot; (Kyushu bitterling)

<text>The Annunciation (from the Latin ; also referred to as the Annunciation to the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Annunciation of Our Lady, or the Annunciation of the Lord; ) is, according to the Gospel of Luke, the announcement made by the archangel Gabriel to Mary that she would conceive and bear a son through a virgin birth and become the mother of Jesus Christ, the Christian Messiah and Son of God, marking the Incarnation. 
According to the Annunciation occurred in the sixth month of Elizabeth&#x27;s pregnancy with John the Baptist. Many Christians observe this event with the Feast of the Annunciation on 25March, an approximation of the northern vernal equinox nine full months before Christmas, the traditional birthday of Jesus.

The Annunciation is a key topic in Christian art in general, as well as in Marian art in the Catholic Church, having been especially prominent during the Middle Ages and Renaissance. A work of art depicting the Annunciation is sometimes itself called an &quot;Annunciation&quot;.

==Religious sources==
===Gospel of Luke===
The Gospel of Luke recounts the Annunciation to the Blessed Virgin Mary:

Various Bible translations also give Gabriel&#x27;s salutation as a variation on: &quot;Hail, full of grace&quot; (, DRV). In this variation, commonly used by Roman Catholics, the archangel Gabriel&#x27;s greeting to Mary forms the first part of the prayer Hail Mary. Mary&#x27;s response to the archangel also forms the second versicle and response of the Angelus prayer. 

===Gospel of Matthew===

A separate, briefer and different annunciation is that given to Joseph in the Gospel of Matthew:

===Apocryphal Gospel of James===
There is a different version contained in the apocryphal Gospel of James, which includes a first appearance of the archangel at the well.

===Manuscript 4Q246===

Manuscript 4Q246 of the Dead Sea Scrolls reads:

It has been suggested that the similarity in content is such that Luke&#x27;s version may in some way be dependent on the Qumran text.

===In the Quran===
The Annunciation is described in the Quran, Surah Maryam, verses .

==Location==
Both the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches hold that the Annunciation took place at Nazareth, but differ slightly as to the precise location. Roman Catholic tradition holds that the Annunciation occurred in Mary&#x27;s home, while Eastern Orthodox tradition holds that it occurred at the town well, known as Mary&#x27;s Well. The Basilica of the Annunciation marks the site preferred by the former, while the Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation (around half a mile away) marks that preferred by the latter.

==Feast day==
===Western Christianity===

The Feast of the Annunciation is usually held on 25 March. It is often translated in the Catholic Church, Anglican and Lutheran liturgical calendars when that date falls during Holy Week or Easter Week or on a Sunday. 

When the calendar system of Anno Domini was first introduced by Dionysius Exiguus in AD 525, he assigned the beginning of the new year to 25 March since, according to Christian theology, the era of grace began with the Incarnation of Christ. The first certain mentions of the feast are in a canon of the 656 Council of Toledo, where it is described as celebrated throughout the Church. The 692 Council of Constantinople &quot;in Trullo&quot; forbade observance of any festivals during Lent, excepting Sunday and the Annunciation. An earlier origin had been claimed for it on the grounds that it appeared in manuscripts of the sermons of Athanasius and Gregory Thaumaturgus but they were subsequently discovered to be spurious.

Along with Easter, 25 March was historically used as the New Year&#x27;s Day in many Christian countries. The holiday was moved to January 1 in France by Charles IX&#x27;s 1564 Edict of Roussillon. In England, the feast of the Annunciation came to be known as Lady Day, and Lady Day marked the beginning of the English new year until 1752.

===Eastern Christianity===


In the Eastern Orthodox, Eastern Catholic, and Oriental Orthodox Churches, the Feast of the Annunciation is one of the twelve &quot;Great Feasts&quot; of the liturgical year, and is among the eight of them that are counted as &quot;feasts of the Lord&quot;. Throughout the Orthodox Church, the feast is celebrated on 25 March. In the churches that use the new style Calendar (Revised Julian or Gregorian), this date coincides with 25 March on the civil calendar, while in those churches using the old style Julian calendar, 25 March is reckoned to fall on 7 April on the civil calendar, and will fall on 8 April starting in the year 2100. Greek Independence Day is celebrated on the feast of the Annunciation and 25 March is also a national holiday in the Lebanon.
The traditional hymn (troparion) for the feast of the Annunciation goes back to Athanasius of Alexandria. It runs:

As the action initiating the Incarnation of Christ, the Annunciation has such an important place in Orthodox Christian theology that the festal Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom is always celebrated on the feast, even if it falls on Great and Holy Friday, the day when the crucifixion of Jesus is remembered. The Divine Liturgy is celebrated on Great and Holy Friday only when the latter coincides with the feast of the Annunciation. If the Annunciation falls on Pascha (Easter Sunday) itself, a coincidence which is called , then it is celebrated jointly with the Resurrection, which is the focus of Easter. Due to these and similar rules, the rubrics surrounding the celebration of the feast are the most complex of all in Orthodox Christian liturgics.

Ephraim the Syrian taught that the date of the conception of Jesus Christ fell on 10 Nisan on the Hebrew calendar, the day in which the passover lamb was selected according to Exodus 12 (Hymn 4 on the Nativity). Some years 10 Nisan falls on 25 March, which is the traditional date for the Feast of the Annunciation and is an official holiday in Lebanon.

==In art==


The Annunciation has been one of the most frequent subjects of Christian art. Depictions of the Annunciation go back to early Christianity, with the Priscilla catacomb including the oldest known fresco of the Annunciation, dating to the 4th century. It has been a favorite artistic subject in both the Christian East and as Roman Catholic Marian art, particularly during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and figures in the repertoire of almost all of the great masters. The figures of the virgin Mary and the angel Gabriel, being emblematic of purity and grace, were favorite subjects of Roman Catholic Marian art, where the scene is also used to represent the perpetual virginity of Mary via the announcement by the angel Gabriel that Mary would conceive a child to be born the Son of God.

Works on the subject have been created by artists such as Sandro Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Caravaggio, Duccio, Henry Ossawa Tanner, Jan van Eyck, and Murillo among others. The mosaics of Pietro Cavallini in Santa Maria in Trastevere in Rome (1291), the frescos of Giotto in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua (1303), Domenico Ghirlandaio&#x27;s fresco at the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence (1486), and Donatello&#x27;s gilded sculpture at the church of Santa Croce, Florence (1435) are famous examples.

Hans Leo Hassler composed a motet &quot;Dixit Maria&quot;, setting Mary&#x27;s consent. Johann Sebastian Bach and others composed cantatas for the feast of the annunciation which is still celebrated in the Lutheran Church, such as &quot;Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern&quot;, BWV 1.

<doc id="469099" wikidata="Q217738" url="?curid=469099" title="List of heads of state of Greece">
<text>This is a list of the heads of state of the modern Greek state, from its establishment during the Greek Revolution to the present day.

==First Hellenic Republic (1822–1832)==

&quot;First Hellenic Republic&quot; is a historiographical term used by academics the actual name of the government was the Provisional Administration of Greece and was established at the beginning of the greek revolution and later renamed as the Hellenic state. There was no separation between head of state and head of government.

===Provisional Administration of Greece (Presidents of the Executive, 1822–1827)===
===Hellenic State (1827–1832)===
==Kingdom of Greece (1832–1924)==
===House of Wittelsbach (1832–1862)===

The London Conference of 1832 was an international conference convened to establish a stable government in Greece. Negotiations between the three Great powers (United Kingdom, France and Russia) resulted in the establishment of the Kingdom of Greece under a Bavarian prince. The decisions were ratified in the Treaty of Constantinople later that year.

The convention offered the throne to Prince Otto of Bavaria. They also established the line of succession which would pass the crown to Otto&#x27;s descendants, or his younger brothers should he have no issue. It was also decided that in no case there would be a personal union of the crowns of Greece and Bavaria. Otto went on to rule Greece until he was exiled in the 23 October 1862 Revolution.

===House of Glücksburg (1863–1924)===

In October 1862, King Otto was deposed in a popular revolt, but while the Greek people rejected Otto, they did not seem averse to the concept of monarchy per se. Many Greeks, seeking closer ties to the pre-eminent world power, Great Britain, rallied around the idea that Prince Alfred, the second son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, could become the next King. British Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston believed that the Greeks were &quot;panting for increase in territory&quot;, hoping that the election of Alfred as King would also result in the incorporation of the Ionian Islands, which were then a British protectorate, into an enlarged Greek state.

The London Conference of 1832, however, had prohibited any of the Great powers&#x27; ruling families from accepting the crown of Greece, and in any event, Queen Victoria was adamantly opposed to the idea. Nevertheless, the Greeks insisted on holding a referendum on the issue of the head of state in November 1862. It was the first referendum ever held in Greece.

Prince Alfred turned down the Kingship and Prince William of Denmark, son of Prince Christian of Denmark, was elected by the National Assembly to become King George I of the Hellenes.


==Second Hellenic Republic (1924–1935)==
The Second Hellenic Republic was a parliamentary republic which was proclaimed on 25 March 1924 and a referendum was held to abolish the Monarchy. The Second Republic was abolished after the 1935 monarchy referendum. The President of the Republic had a symbolic role as head of the state.

;Status

==Kingdom of Greece (1935–1973)==

===House of Glücksburg (1935–1973)===


==Republic under the Greek junta (1973–1974)==
On 1 June 1973 the junta abolished the monarchy and replaced it with a presidential republic. The abolition of the monarchy was approved by a rigged referendum held on 29 July 1973.

==Third Hellenic Republic (1974–present)==
On 24 July 1974, the junta was overthrown and democracy restored. A second referendum, held on 8 December 1974, confirmed the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of the current parliamentary republic, with the President of the Republic in a symbolic role as head of the state.

<doc id="469110" wikidata="Q300839" url="?curid=469110" title="Ar (Unix)">
<text>The archiver, also known simply as ar, is a Unix utility that maintains groups of files as a single archive file. Today, codice_1 is generally used only to create and update static library files that the link editor or linker uses and for generating .deb packages for the Debian family; it can be used to create archives for any purpose, but has been largely replaced by codice_2 for purposes other than static libraries. An implementation of codice_1 is included as one of the GNU Binutils.

In the Linux Standard Base (LSB), codice_1 has been deprecated and is expected to disappear in a future release of that standard. The rationale provided was that &quot;the LSB does not include software development utilities nor does it specify .o and .a file formats.&quot;

==File format details==

The ar format has never been standardized; modern archives are based on a common format with two main variants, BSD and System V (initially known as COFF, and used as well by GNU, ELF, and Windows.)

Historically there have been other variants including V6, V7, AIX (small and big), and Coherent, which all vary significantly from the common format.

Debian &quot;.deb&quot; archives use the common format.

An ar file begins with a global header, followed by a header and data section for each file stored within the ar file.

Each data section is 2 byte aligned. If it would end on an odd offset, a newline (&#x27;\n&#x27;, 0x0A) is used as filler.

===File signature===
The file signature is a single field containing the magic ASCII string codice_5 followed by a single LF control character (0x0A).

===File header===
Each file stored in an ar archive includes a file header to store information about the file. The common format is as follows. Numeric values are encoded in ASCII and all values right-padded with ASCII spaces (0x20).

As the headers only include printable ASCII characters and line feeds, an archive containing only text files therefore still appears to be a text file itself.

The members are aligned to even byte boundaries. &quot;Each archive file member begins on an even byte boundary; a newline is inserted between files if necessary. Nevertheless, the size given reflects the actual size of the file exclusive of padding.&quot;

Due to the limitations of file name length and format, both the GNU and BSD variants devised different methods of storing long filenames. Although the common format does not suffer from the year 2038 problem, many implementations of the ar utility do and may need to be modified in the future to handle correctly timestamps in excess of 2147483647. A description of these extensions is found in libbfd.

Depending on the format, many ar implementations include a global symbol table (aka armap, directory or index) for fast linking without needing to scan the whole archive for a symbol. POSIX recognizes this feature, and requires ar implementations to have an option for updating it. Most implementations put it at the first file entry.

====BSD variant====
BSD ar stores filenames right-padded with ASCII spaces. This causes issues with spaces inside filenames.
4.4BSD ar stores extended filenames by placing the string &quot;#1/&quot; followed by the file name length in the file name field, and storing the real filename in front of the data section.

BSD ar utility traditionally does not handle the building of a global symbol lookup table, and delegates this task to a separate utility named ranlib, which inserts an architecture-specific file named codice_6 as first archive member. Some descendents put a space and &quot;SORTED&quot; after the name to indicate a sorted version. A 64-bit variant called exists on Darwin.

Since POSIX added the requirement for the option as a replacement of ranlib, however, newer BSD ar implementations have been rewritten to have this feature. FreeBSD in particular ditched the SYMDEF table format and embraced the System V style table.

====System V (or GNU) variant====
System V ar uses a &#x27;/&#x27; character (0x2F) to mark the end of the filename; this allows for the use of spaces without the use of an extended filename. Then it stores multiple extended filenames in the data section of a file with the name &quot;//&quot;, this record is referred to by future headers. A header references an extended filename by storing a &quot;/&quot; followed by a decimal offset to the start of the filename in the extended filename data section. The format of this &quot;//&quot; file itself is simply a list of the long filenames, each separated by one or more LF characters. Note that the decimal offsets are number of characters, not line or string number within the &quot;//&quot; file. This is usually the second entry of the file, after the symbol table which always is the first.

System V ar uses the special filename &quot;/&quot; to denote that the following data entry contains a symbol lookup table, which is used in ar libraries to speed up access. This symbol table is built in three parts which are recorded together as contiguous data.

# A 32-bit big endian integer, giving the number of entries in the table.
# A set of 32-bit big endian integers. One for each symbol, recording the position within the archive of the header for the file containing this symbol.
# A set of Zero-terminated strings. Each is a symbol name, and occurs in the same order as the list of positions in part 2.

Some System V systems do not use the format described above for the symbol lookup table.
For operating systems such as HP-UX 11.0, this information is stored in a data structure based on the SOM file format.

The special file &quot;/&quot; is not terminated with a specific sequence; the end is assumed once the last symbol name has been read.

To overcome the 4 GiB file size limit some operating system like Solaris 11.2 and GNU use a variant lookup table. Instead of 32-bit integers, 64-bit integers are used in the symbol lookup tables. The string &quot;/SYM64/&quot; instead &quot;/&quot; is used as identifier for this table

===== Windows variant =====
The Windows (PE/COFF) variant is based on the SysV/GNU variant. The first entry &quot;/&quot; has the same layout as the SysV/GNU symbol table. The second entry is another &quot;/&quot;, a Microsoft extension that stores an extended symbol cross-reference table. This one is sorted and uses little-endian integers. The third entry is the optional &quot;//&quot; long name data as in SysV/GNU.

===Thin archive===
The version of in GNU binutils and Elfutils have an additional &quot;thin archive&quot; format with the magic number . A thin archive only contains a symbol table and references to the file. The file format is essentially a System V format archive where every file is stored without the data sections. Every filename is stored as a &quot;long&quot; filename and they are to be resolved as if they were symbolic links.

== Example usage ==
To create an archive from files , , , the following command would be used:
 ar rcs libclass.a class1.o class2.o class3.o

Unix linkers, usually invoked through the C compiler codice_7, can read codice_1 files and extract object files from them, so if codice_9 is an archive containing codice_10, codice_11 and codice_12, then
 cc main.c libclass.a
or (if libclass.a is placed in standard library path, like )
 cc main.c -lclass
or (during linking)
 ld ... main.o -lclass ...
is the same as:
 cc main.c class1.o class2.o class3.o

<doc id="469111" wikidata="Q1280521" url="?curid=469111" title="Miwa Nishikawa">
<text>is a Japanese director and screenwriter. Nishikawa received a degree in literature from the University of Waseda, and after working on several independent films as well as catching the eye of Hirokazu Kore-eda, her film making career took off with her first film, &quot;Wild Berries&quot;, which won the award for best screenplay at the Mainichi Film Award. In addition to her film making career, Nishikawa has also written a book titled &quot;The Long Excuse&quot;.

==Life and career==
Nishikawa began her film career as a college student working as a staff member on Hirokazu Koreeda&#x27;s 1998 film &quot;After Life&quot;. Soon afterward she was an assistant director for Yoshimitsu Morita on his 1999 thriller . and again on Kore-eda&#x27;s 2001 movie &quot;Distance&quot;. When Nishikawa went on to write and direct her first feature film, the September 2003 release, &quot;Wild Berries&quot;, Koreeda was the producer. The film won the Best New Director award at the 2004 Yokohama Film Festival, the Best New Director prize at the 13th Japanese Professional Movie Awards and the Best Screenplay Award and one of the Sponichi Grand Prize New Talent Awards at the 58th Mainichi Film Concours for 2003.

After directing a segment in the omnibus work &quot;Fiimeiru&quot;, Nishikawa wrote and directed her second feature film &quot;Sway&quot; in 2006. The film brought Nishikawa both the Best Screenplay and Best Director awards at the 28th Yokohama Film Festival and the film won First Place Best Film at the festival. In 2009, she directed her third full-length film &quot;Dear Doctor&quot; and also wrote the screenplay which she adapted from her own novel. Nishikawa won the Best Screenplay award at the 31st Yokohama Film Festival where &quot;Dear Doctor&quot; took the Best Film Award. She also took the Best Director award at the 2009 Hochi Film Awards.

Nishikawa&#x27;s next film, &quot;Dreams for Sale&quot;, about a young couple engaged in a marriage fraud scheme, was released in Japan in September 2012 and was shown at various international film festivals including the Toronto International Film Festival, the Chicago International Film Festival and at the Japan Society of New York. Nishikawa travelled to San Francisco for the film&#x27;s screening at the first Japan Film Festival in San Francisco in August 2013. At an interview there she lamented the state of the Japanese film industry saying that it was boring because &quot;nobody wants to embark on a venture.&quot;

==Film career==

At the forefront of a constantly growing ring of contemporary Japanese film makers, Nishikawa attempts to sidestep issues of gender by embracing conventional imagery, representations and style. Breaking into film under the tutelage of acclaimed auteur Hirokazu Kore-eda, Nishikawa collaborated on her first film (Wild Berries) with him using a personally written script.

===Wild Berries (2003)===
Miwa Nishikawa&#x27;s first feature film; in collaboration with Hirokazu Koreeda, a drama as well as an ironic comedy, launched her into the limelight. &quot;Wild Berries&quot; is a story of an ordinary family that turns unstable when their frivolous son Shuji returns home after a long absence. Tomoko, the responsible daughter of the family, is a grade school teacher. As the only member of the family who has a job and a good moral sense, the family sees her new boyfriend as a savior. The action begins when Tomoko Akechi, the daughter of the family, brings her fiancé home for dinner to meet the family. The boyfriend claims he is charmed by the Akechi&#x27;s Industry, but the viewer finds out that the father is unemployed and slaving for money. The senile grandfather whom every member of the family secretly detests, dies suddenly, much to everyone&#x27;s relief. At the grandfathers funeral, the prodigal son Shuji makes a grand entrance, narrowly saving Yoshiro (The Father) from an angry creditor. The arrival of Shuji seems too good to be true when he is able to swiftly evade creditors with a seemingly unending flow of cash. The alienated sister Tomoko, recalls Shuji boasting about a remote patch of wild berries not too far from their house. Tomoko tries to find this patch to no avail. Reminding Shuji of this incident, he offers to show her this patch. What happens during this hike is exactly the dangerous moral predicament that Tomoko is desperate to escape.

===Sway (2006)===
Director and screenwriter of this film; Nishikawa, with the help of distribution companies: Bandai Visual, Eisei Gekijo, Engine Film and TV Man Union, presents her second feature film. &quot;Sway&quot; is representative of Nishikawa&#x27;s likeness of the pre-straight-to-video salad days of Japanese Cinema. The Japanese film, which stars Odagiri Jo and opened on only six screens in South Korea in August 2006, set the record for an &quot;independent&quot; movie by pulling 300,000 admissions in only 
fifteen days. Playboy Photographer Yakeru Hayakawa reluctantly returns to his family&#x27;s rural home for his mother&#x27;s funeral. Barely anything has changed; he is still the spoiled brat, the father is still a bully, the pushover brother Minoru is still working at the gas station and Hayakawa&#x27;s Ex, Chieko, is still available. The short-lived reunion sparks the affection of the brothers creating a romantic rivalry. Visiting their childhood romping ground of Hasumi Gorge, the tension gives way to confrontation on an old rickety rope bridge. Chieko favours the glitzy Hayakawa over Minoru, who pleads with her to reconsider. Chieko falters in her footing, not in her resolve. It is unclear if Chieko fell to her death or if she was pushed. In the following court case, the innocence and character of each brother stands trial leaving only one behind bars.

===Dear Doctor (2009)===
Nishikawa&#x27;s third feature film was &quot;Dear Doctor&quot;. Dr. Ino Osamu is the primary physician in a small country village. The entire village depends upon him and his assistant, Nurse Otake, for almost anything health related. A recent medical-school graduate, Keisuke is mentored by the two and learns what his big city degree didn&#x27;t teach him, the emotional connection between doctor and patient. Keisuke is impressed with Ino&#x27;s relationship with his patients and aspires to emulate the same qualities. However, when the good doctor goes missing, police detectives discover that Dr. Ino&#x27;s presence in the town was just as mysterious as his disappearance. Beginning with Keisuke&#x27;s involvement with the country clinic, the police try to piece together this vanishing act.

===The Long Excuse (2015)===
The story outlines the life of a best-selling author during the year after his wife dies in a tragic accident. His loss puts him into a period of deep reflection. In his mid forties, novelist Kei Tsumura still has his good looks, and is at the peak of his popularity, appearing on television. Quitting his job to focus on writing, Kei fell on the support of his now deceased wife. Being timid yet self-absorbed provided social challenges for him. His wife Natsuko had ventured to the ski slopes one winter with Yuki Omiya, a highschool friend, when their bus plunges off the mountain killing them both. Meanwhile, Kei has taken advantage of Natsuko&#x27;s absence and is in the midst of carnal pleasure at the time of the accident, leaving him guilty and grieving. Later, Kei meets with the deceased Yuki&#x27;s husband Yoichi, feels a sense of familiarity, and becomes involved with helping Yoichi with his children. Kei also discovers an unsent text addressed to him on his wife&#x27;s phone that reads: &quot;I don&#x27;t love you anymore. Not at all.&quot;. Kei blows up and breaks off all connection with the outside world, severing his weekly visits with Yoichi even picking a fight. Yoichi is arrested for beating up a sex worker, and when Kei bails him out, their efforts to mend what they had are useless. Kei eventually finds himself and begins to write on his and his wife&#x27;s relationship; winning him a minor literary award.

===Under the Open Sky (2020)===
Under the Open Sky

==Writing career==
Aside from Nishikawa&#x27;s film career, her writing has expanded to the world of literature. In 2006 her second feature film, Yureru (Sway), was showcased in the Directors’ Fortnight at Cannes; she received the Yomiuri Prize for Literature (Drama &amp; Film) for the script, and subsequently made her publishing debut by novelizing the work. Her 2009 collection of stories Kinō no Kamisama (Gods of Yesterday) was shortlisted for the Naoki Prize, and her 2015 novel Nagai iiwake (The Long Excuse) became a candidate for the Yamamoto Shūgorō Prize.

<text>In the law of the United States, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) is the codification of the general and permanent regulations promulgated by the executive departments and agencies of the federal government of the United States. The CFR is divided into 50 titles that represent broad areas subject to federal regulation.

The CFR annual edition is published as a special issue of the &quot;Federal Register&quot; by the Office of the Federal Register (part of the National Archives and Records Administration) and the Government Publishing Office. In addition to this annual edition, the CFR is published online on the Electronic CFR (eCFR) website, which is updated daily.

==Background==
Congress frequently delegates authority to an executive branch agency to issue regulations to govern some sphere. These statutes are called &quot;authorizing statute&quot; or &quot;enabling statute&quot; (or &quot;authorizing legislation&quot;). Authorizing statutes typically have two parts: (1) a substantive scope, typically using language such as &quot;The Secretary shall promulgate regulations to [accomplish some purpose or within some scope]&quot;; and (2) procedural requirements, typically to invoke rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA, codified at ), Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA, codified at ), and several executive orders (primarily Executive Order 12866)). Generally, each of these laws requires a process that includes (a) publication of the proposed rules in a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), (b) certain cost-benefit analyses, (c) request for public comment and participation in the decision-making, and (d) adoption and publication of the final rule, via the &quot;Federal Register&quot;. Rulemaking culminates in the inclusion of a regulation in the Code of Federal Regulations. Such regulations are often referred to as &quot;implementing regulations&quot; vis-a-vis the authorizing statute.

==Publication procedure==
The rules and regulations are first promulgated or published in the &quot;Federal Register&quot;. The CFR is structured into 50 subject matter titles. Agencies are assigned chapters within these titles. The titles are broken down into chapters, parts, sections and paragraphs. For example, 42 C.F.R. § 260.11(a)(1) would indicate &quot;title 42, part 260, section 11, paragraph (a)(1).&quot; Conversationally, it would be read as &quot;forty-two C F R two-sixty point eleven a one&quot; or similar.

While new regulations are continually becoming effective, the printed volumes of the CFR are issued once each calendar year, on this schedule:

*Titles 1–16 are updated as of January 1
*Titles 17–27 are updated as of April 1
*Titles 28–41 are updated as of July 1
*Titles 42–50 are updated as of October 1

The Office of the Federal Register also keeps an unofficial, online version of the CFR, the e-CFR, which is normally updated within two days after changes that have been published in the &quot;Federal Register&quot; become effective. The Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules lists rulemaking authority for regulations codified in the CFR.

== History ==
The Federal Register Act originally provided for a complete compilation of all existing regulations promulgated prior to the first publication of the &quot;Federal Register&quot;, but was amended in 1937 to provide a codification of all regulations every five years. The first edition of the CFR was published in 1938. Beginning in 1963 for some titles and for all titles in 1967, the Office of the Federal Register began publishing yearly revisions, and beginning in 1972 published revisions in staggered quarters.

On March 11, 2014, Rep. Darrell Issa introduced the Federal Register Modernization Act (H.R. 4195; 113th Congress), a bill that would revise requirements for the filing of documents with the Office of the Federal Register for inclusion in the &quot;Federal Register&quot; and for the publication of the &quot;Code of Federal Regulations&quot; to reflect the changed publication requirement in which they would be available online but would not be required to be printed. The American Association of Law Libraries (AALL) strongly opposed the bill, arguing that the bill undermines citizens&#x27; right to be informed by making it more difficult for citizens to find their government&#x27;s regulations. According to AALL, a survey they conducted &quot;revealed that members of the public, librarians, researchers, students, attorneys, and small business owners continue to rely on the print&quot; version of the &quot;Federal Register&quot;. AALL also argued that the lack of print versions of the &quot;Federal Register&quot; and &quot;CFR&quot; would mean the 15 percent of Americans who do not use the internet would lose their access to that material. The House voted on July 14, 2014, to pass the bill 386–0. However, the bill failed to come to a vote in the Senate, and died upon the start of the 114th Congress.

== Activity and changes over time ==
The Code of Federal Regulations is a dynamic document with many changes and edits over time; however, tracking the edits and their impact is difficult. Simple counts of the number of rules, words, or pages is insufficient.

<text>&quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot; is a song by American disco group Village People, written by Jacques Morali (also the record&#x27;s producer) and singer Victor Willis and released in October 1978 by Casablanca Records as the only single from their third studio album, &quot;Cruisin&#x27;&quot; (1978). A medley with &quot;Hot Cop&quot; reached No. 2 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Music/Club Play Singles chart, while the song reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in early 1979, placing behind both &quot;Le Freak&quot; by Chic and &quot;Da Ya Think I&#x27;m Sexy?&quot; by Rod Stewart. In 2024, 46 years after its release, &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot; spent six weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Digital Song Sales chart. Outside the U.S., &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot; reached No. 1 on the UK singles chart around the same time, becoming the group&#x27;s biggest hit. It has sold 12 million copies worldwide.

The song remains popular and is played at many sporting events in the US and Europe, with crowds joining in on the dance by spelling out the four letters of the song&#x27;s title via arm movements. &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot; is No. 7 on VH1&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Dance Songs of the 20th Century&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In its official press release, the Library noted that &quot;back in its heyday, &#x27;Y.M.C.A.&#x27; was a hit around the world, going to No. 1 on the charts in over 15 countries, and its ongoing popularity is evidence that, despite the naysayers, disco has never truly died.&quot;

==History==
In the US, the YMCA began building single room occupancy (SRO) facilities in the 1880s to house men from rural areas who moved into cities to look for work. By the 1970s, the typical YMCA tenants were more likely to be homeless people and youth facing life issues, rather than people migrating from rural areas.

Victor Willis, lead singer and lyricist, recalls that while in the studio, producer Jacques Morali asked him, &quot;What exactly is the YMCA?&quot; After Willis explained it to him, he saw the expression on Morali&#x27;s face and said, &quot;Don&#x27;t tell me, Jacques, you want to write a song about it?&quot; and they quickly wrote the track for the album &quot;Cruisin&#x27;&quot;. Upon the song&#x27;s release, the YMCA threatened to sue the band over trademark infringement, but ultimately settled with the composers out of court, later expressing pride regarding the song&#x27;s purpose as a tribute to the organization.

In 2015, Willis won a legal case against Can&#x27;t Stop Productions, successfully claiming that he and Morali had written this and other Village People songs together, without any involvement from executive producer Henri Belolo, who was credited on the song&#x27;s original release. The production company claimed that Belolo had written French lyrics that were then adapted by Willis, but this claim was rejected by the court which ruled that Belolo&#x27;s name as co-writer should be removed.

==Composition and background==
===Lyrical content===
Taken at face value, the song&#x27;s lyrics extol the virtues of the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association (YMCA). However, according to some in the gay culture, the song was implicitly understood as celebrating YMCA&#x27;s reputation as a popular cruising and hookup spot, particularly for the younger men to whom it was addressed. The initial goal of Village People producers Morali and Belolo was to attract disco&#x27;s gay audience by featuring popular gay fantasy in their music. Although co-creator Morali was gay and the group was initially intended to target gay men, the group became more popular and more mainstream over time.

Willis had said that he wrote the song in Vancouver, British Columbia and, through his publicist, that he did not write &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot; as a gay anthem, but rather as a reflection of the fun activities that urban black youth experienced at YMCA, such as basketball and swimming. However, Willis has often acknowledged his fondness for double entendre.

In 2024, Willis reiterated his denial that &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot; was written as a gay anthem and that people needed to &quot;get their minds out of the gutter&quot;. While he doesn&#x27;t mind the song&#x27;s use as a gay anthem, the &quot;false assumptions were damaging to the song&quot; and further said, &quot;since I wrote the lyrics and ought to know what the lyrics I wrote is really about, come January 2025, my wife will start suing each and every news organization that falsely refers to Y.M.C.A., either in their headlines or alluded to in the base of the story, that Y.M.C.A. is somehow a gay anthem because such notion is based solely on the song&#x27;s lyrics alluding to elicit [sic] activity for which it does not.&quot; Willis claimed instead that the passage in the song about &quot;hang[ing] out with all the boys&quot; was &quot;simply 1970s Black slang for Black guys hanging out together for sports, gambling or whatever&quot;. Willis also added that &quot;I don&#x27;t mind that gays think of YMCA as their anthem.&quot;

U.S. president Donald Trump has described &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot; as the &quot;gay national anthem&quot;.

In an article for &quot;Gothamist&quot;, writer Abbey White states the atmosphere of YMCA was &quot;more complicated than the lyrics portray, with gay culture and working-class workouts coexisting in a single communal space&quot;, creating &quot;a mix of white-collar and blue-collar residents, along with retired seniors and veterans&quot;, with about half of the residents being gay. While the song gives the impression that YMCA SROs in the 1970s had a party atmosphere, Paul Groth states that YMCA SRO units actually had &quot;more supervision of your social life — a kind of management as to how you behaved ... [than] in a commercial rooming house, which mostly wanted to make sure the rooms were rented&quot;, without monitoring who you brought to your room.

===Song structure===
The song, played in the key of G♭ major, begins with 6 bars of a D♭ suspended chord over a bare disco drum beat. This is followed by a brass riff, backed by the constant pulse that typified disco. Many different instruments are used throughout for an overall orchestral feel, another disco convention, but it is brass that stands out.

As with other Village People hits, the lead vocals are handled by Willis and the background vocals are supplied by Willis and professional background singers. The distinctive vocal line features the repeated &quot;Young man!&quot; ecphonesis, followed by Willis singing the verse lines. The background vocals join in throughout the song.

Willis&#x27; version of the song is used in the Village People film &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot;, though by that time Ray Simpson had replaced him as the policeman.

==Reception==
&quot;Billboard&quot; stated that &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot; is &quot;another example of [the Village People&#x27;s] droll humor, playing off its gayness with hard hat themes.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; also called &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot; (and its B-side, &quot;The Women&quot;) one of the best cuts on the &quot;Cruisin″&quot; album. &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot; has &quot;layered horn work and strings and a bright, soaring chorus&quot; and that &quot;Willis&#x27; lead vocals are commanding.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; said that it &quot;has the same foot-stomping bass line and tongue-in-cheek lyrics&quot; as previous Village People hit &quot;Macho Man&quot; and that &quot;the vocals are strong and the production thunderous&quot;.

Despite not reaching No. 1 in the United States, it became a No. 1 hit throughout the world and has since remained popular at parties, sporting events, weddings and other functions.

==Music video==
The accompanying music video for &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot;, filmed in New York City in July 1978, features the band singing the song and dancing all over the city. The location shown the most is the original site of YMCA, McBurney, 213 West 23rd Street. Other filming locations included 395 West Street – site of the Ramrod gay club – the West Side Piers and Hudson River Park. It ends with the camera zooming in on the Empire State Building.

==Origin of dance and hand movement==
&quot;YMCA&quot; is also the name of a group dance with cheerleader Y-M-C-A choreography invented to fit the song. One of the phases involves moving arms to form the letters Y-M-C-A as they are sung in the chorus:

:Y arms outstretched and raised upwards
:M made by bending the elbows from the &#x27;Y&#x27; pose so the fingertips meet in front of the chest
:C arms extended to the left
:A hands held together above head

The dance originated during the group&#x27;s performance of the song on the January 6, 1979 episode of &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. Host Dick Clark then said to Willis that he would like to show him something, playing the song again with the audience doing YMCA hand gestures. Willis immediately picked up on the dance and mimicked the hand movements back at the audience as other Village People members stared at him with puzzled looks. Clark then turned to Willis and said, &quot;Victor, think you can work this dance into your routine?&quot; Willis responded, &quot;I think we&#x27;re gonna have to.&quot; In a 2008 retrospective article for &quot;Spin&quot;, Randy Jones explained that the dance originated as a misunderstanding: the group&#x27;s original choreographed dance had the group clapping above their heads during the chorus and the audience, believing them to be making the letter &quot;Y&quot;, began following suit.

Following the sixth inning of New York Yankees baseball games at Yankee Stadium, the grounds crew traditionally grooms the infield while leading the crowd in the dance. The Bleacher Creatures used to sing &quot;why are you gay?&quot; to the tune when it was played but agreed in 2010 to stop doing it.

==Impact and legacy==
VH1 placed &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot; at #7 on their list of &quot;100 Greatest Dance Songs&quot; in 2000, while &quot;Paste Magazine&quot; ranked the song #1 on their list of &quot;The 60 Best Dancefloor Classics&quot; in February 2017. In 2022, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it #139 in their list of &quot;200 Greatest Dance Songs of All Time&quot;. In 2024, &quot;Billboard&quot; placed &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot; at #61 on their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Jock Jams of All Time&quot;.

The Village People recorded a version of the song for Pepsi in 1997 for a commercial featuring a group of dancing bears, changing the lyrics to match the drink and spelling out P-E-P-S-I. A few months afterwards, Pepsi used the song again as part of its new blue-themed imaging for the Pepsi Globe. In September 2000 &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot; was used as the Space Shuttle wake-up call on day 11 of STS-106. On December 31, 2008, &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot; set a Guinness World Record when 40,148 people danced to Village People&#x27;s live performance of the song at the 2008 Sun Bowl game in El Paso, Texas.

In 2001 it was part of the &quot;Swamp Karaoke Dance Party&quot; in &quot;Shrek&quot; (2001) performed by Monsieur Hood and the Merry Men.

In 2012, in a landmark ruling in accordance with the Copyright Act of 1976, Willis terminated his copyrights granted to the publishers Can&#x27;t Stop Productions and Scorpio Music.
In March 2015, it was determined that the sole writers of the song were Morali and Willis.

In March 2020, the US Library of Congress added the song to its National Recording Registry, which preserves for posterity audio that is &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;. In December 2020, &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

===Donald Trump===
U.S. president Donald Trump began using the song (as well as another Village People song, &quot;Macho Man&quot;) to close out his rallies during his 2020 re-election campaign. Willis initially approved its use but after several incidents involving the Black Lives Matter protests, he demanded Trump stop, although he later relaxed his stance. &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; parodied the song and the group&#x27;s reaction with a &quot;cease and desist&quot; on the October 24, 2020 segment of &quot;Weekend Update&quot;. As a result, the song was back in the Top 20 on iTunes in November 2020 and hit the #2 spot on the Billboard Dance Digital Song Sales chart. On November 6, following the media&#x27;s declaration that Joe Biden had taken the lead in Pennsylvania over Trump in the 2020 presidential election, Biden supporters celebrated by dancing in the streets and singing the song across the city of Philadelphia. The song was played over loudspeakers as Trump boarded Air Force One on January 20, 2021, en route to Florida before Biden&#x27;s inauguration.

In his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump once again used the song at his rallies, usually performing his signature dance while it played. Willis lamented his use of the song since 2020 and even considered a lawsuit to block Trump from using it, but ultimately decided there was &quot;not much he can do about it&quot; and decided it was &quot;beneficial&quot; to have the song back on the charts, stating it was &quot;good for business.&quot;

In January 2025, Village People performed the song at several events for Trump&#x27;s second inauguration.

==Hideki Saijo version==
In 1979, Japanese singer Hideki Saijo covered the song for his compilation album &quot;Young Man/Hideki Flying Up&quot; as &quot;Young Man (Y.M.C.A.)&quot;. In Japan, the cover topped on the Oricon chart for five consecutive weeks and became the seventh best-selling single of 1979 in Japan. For the cover, the lyrics were re-written in Japanese by Saijo&#x27;s manager, Ryuji Amagai. This version is also notable for having a call-and-response in the middle where Saijo and a group of child singers chant the letters &quot;Y M C A&quot; back and forth.

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Young Man (Y.M.C.A.)&quot; debuted at number two on the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart, and in the following week, it reached number one, where it stayed for five consecutive weeks. The song finally became the seventh best-selling single of 1979 in Japan and Saijo&#x27;s best-selling single to date, with the sales of 808,000 copies.

Following the death of Saijo on 16 May 2018, the song re-entered the chart, peaking at number fifteen on the Billboard Japan Hot 100.

===Accolades===
&quot;Young Man (Y.M.C.A.)&quot; won the Grand Prix at the FNS Music Festival &#x27;79 and the 10th Japan Music Awards. Despite the hit, the song was disqualified for the 21st Japan Record Awards due to the competition&#x27;s guideline that requires the songs to be original work. At the award, Saijo instead won the golden award for his single, &quot;Yuki ga Areba&quot; (1979).

===Cover versions===
&quot;Young Man (Y.M.C.A.)&quot; has been covered by multiple other Asian musicians, including Keisuke Kuwata, Aska, George Lam, Yang Kun, and E-girls.

<doc id="469134" wikidata="Q727493" url="?curid=469134" title="Yield to maturity">
<text>The yield to maturity (YTM), book yield or redemption yield of a fixed-interest security is an estimate of the total rate of return anticipated to be earned by an investor who buys it at a given market price, holds it to maturity, and receives all interest payments and the capital redemption on schedule. 

It is the theoretical internal rate of return, or the overall interest rate, of a bond — the discount rate at which the present value of all future cash flows from the bond is equal to the current price of the bond. The YTM is often given in terms of annual percentage rate (APR), but more often market convention is followed. In a number of major markets, the convention is to quote annualized yields with semi-annual compounding.

==Main assumptions==

The YTM calculation formulates certain stability conditions of the security, its owner, and the market going forward:
* The owner holds the security to maturity.
* The issuer makes all interest and principal payments on time and in full.
* The owner reinvests all interest payments rather than spending them, to gain the benefit of compounded returns.
* The market provides consistent reinvestment opportunity at the YTM rate throughout the future, with no cost to transact.

The YTM calculation accounts for the effect of the current market price on the yield going forward, but omits the possible effects of contingent events. Hence it is not an &quot;expected&quot;, or &quot;risk-adjusted&quot; rate. The YTM will be realized only if the above assumptions are met, and factors such as default risk or reinvestment risk do not occur. The total return realized at maturity is likely to differ from the YTM calculated at the time of purchase, perhaps considerably.

In practice, the rates that will actually be earned on reinvested interest payments are a critical component of a bond&#x27;s investment return. Yet they are unknown at the time of purchase. The owner takes on reinvestment risk, which is the possibility that the future reinvestment rates will differ from the yield to maturity at the time the security is purchased. Reinvestment is not a factor for buyers, who intend to spend rather than reinvest the coupon payments, such as those practicing asset/liability matching strategies.

Some literature claims that earning the yield to maturity does not require the investor reinvest the coupon payments, and that assuming reinvestment is a common mistake in financial literature.

== Taxes and transaction costs ==
The yield is usually quoted without making any allowance for tax paid by the investor on the return, and is then known as &quot;gross redemption yield&quot;. It also does not make any allowance for the dealing costs incurred by the purchaser (or seller).

==Coupon rate vs. YTM and parity==
* If a bond&#x27;s coupon rate is less than its YTM, then the bond is selling at a discount.
* If a bond&#x27;s coupon rate is more than its YTM, then the bond is selling at a premium.
* If a bond&#x27;s coupon rate is equal to its YTM, then the bond is selling at par.

==Variants of yield to maturity==

As some bonds have different characteristics, there are some variants of YTM:
* Yield to call (YTC): when a bond is callable (can be repurchased by the issuer at pre-determined date before the maturity), the market looks also to the Yield to call, which is the same calculation of the YTM, but assumes that the bond will be called, so the cashflow is shortened.
* Yield to put (YTP): same as yield to call, but when the bond holder has the option to sell the bond back to the issuer at a fixed price on specified date.
* Yield to worst (YTW): when a bond is callable, puttable, exchangeable, or has other features, the yield to worst is the lowest yield of yield to maturity, yield to call, yield to put, and others.

==Consequences==
When the YTM is less than the (expected) yield of another investment, one might be tempted to swap the investments. Care should be taken to subtract any transaction costs, or taxes.

==Calculations==
===Formula for yield to maturity for zero-coupon bonds===

formula_1

====Example 1====
Consider a 30-year zero-coupon bond with a face value of $100. If the bond is priced at an annual YTM of 10%, it will cost $5.73 today (the present value of this cash flow, 100/(1.1)30 = 5.73). Over the coming 30 years, the price will advance to $100, and the annualized return will be 10%.

What happens in the meantime? Suppose that over the first 10 years of the holding period, interest rates decline, and the yield-to-maturity on the bond falls to 7%. With 20 years remaining to maturity, the price of the bond will be 100/1.0720, or $25.84. Even though the yield-to-maturity for the remaining life of the bond is just 7%, and the yield-to-maturity bargained for when the bond was purchased was only 10%, the annualized return earned over the first 10 years is 16.25%. This can be found by evaluating (1+i) from the equation (1+i)10 = (25.84/5.73), giving 0.1625.

Over the remaining 20 years of the bond, the annual rate earned is not 16.25%, but rather 7%. This can be found by evaluating (1+i) from the equation (1+i)20 = 100/25.84, giving 1.07. Over the entire 30 year holding period, the original $5.73 invested increased to $100, so 10% per annum was earned, irrespective of any interest rate changes in between.

====Example 2====

An ABCXYZ Company bond that matures in one year, has a 5% yearly interest rate (coupon), and has a par value of $100. To sell to a new investor the bond must be priced for a current yield of 5.56%.

The annual bond coupon should increase from $5 to $5.56 but the coupon can&#x27;t change as only the bond price can change. So the bond is priced approximately at $100 - $0.56 or $99.44 .

If the bond is held until maturity, the bond will pay $5 as interest and $100 par value for the matured bond. For the $99.44 investment, the bond investor will receive $105 and therefore the yield to maturity is 5.56 / 99.44 for 5.59% in the one year time period. Then continuing by trial and error, a bond gain of 5.53 divided by a bond price of 99.47 produces a yield to maturity of 5.56%. Also, the bond gain and the bond price add up to 105.

Finally, a one-year zero-coupon bond of $105 and with a yield to maturity of 5.56%, calculates at a price of 105 / 1.0556^1 or 99.47.

===Coupon-bearing Bonds===

For bonds with multiple coupons, it is not generally possible to solve for yield in terms of price algebraically. A numerical root-finding technique such as Newton&#x27;s method must be used to approximate the yield, which renders the present value of future cash flows equal to the bond price.

===Varying coupon===

With varying coupons the general discounting rule should be applied.

==Subscriber Yield==

A term used in Japan, this is simply the Yield to Maturity at time of issue: in other words the Yield to Maturity enjoyed by the buyer (subscriber) in the primary market.

<doc id="469135" wikidata="Q2454699" url="?curid=469135" title="Cadwaladr">
<text>Cadwaladr ap Cadwallon (also spelled Cadwalader or Cadwallader in English) was king of Gwynedd in Wales from around 655 to 664 or 682. He died in one of two devastating plagues that happened in 664 and in 682. Little else is known of his reign.

The red dragon (), long known as a Welsh symbol, appearing in the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, and the stories of Geoffrey of Monmouth, has, since the accession of Henry VII to the English throne, often been referred to as &quot;The Red Dragon of Cadwaladr&quot;. The association with Cadwaladr is a traditional one without any historical basis.

Though little is known about the historical Cadwaladr, he became a mythical redeemer figure in Welsh culture. He is a prominent character in the romantic stories of Geoffrey of Monmouth, where he is portrayed as the last in an ancient line to hold the title King of Britain. In Geoffrey&#x27;s account, he does not die of plague. He renounces his throne in 688 to become a pilgrim, in response to a prophecy that his sacrifice of personal power will bring about a future victory of the Britons over the Anglo-Saxons. Geoffrey&#x27;s story of Cadwaladr&#x27;s prophecy and trip to Rome is believed to be an embellishment of the events in the life of Cædwalla of Wessex, whom Geoffrey mistakenly conflated with Cadwaladr.

For later Welsh commentators, the myth &quot;provided a messianic hope for the future deliverance of Britain from the dominion of the Saxons&quot;. It was also used by both the Yorkist and Lancastrian factions during the Wars of the Roses to claim that their candidate would fulfil the prophecy by restoring the authentic lineage stemming from Cadwaladr.

== Historical record ==
Cadwaladr was the son of Cadwallon ap Cadfan, and the successor to King Cadafael. His name appears in the pedigrees of the Jesus College MS. 20 (as &quot;Kadwaladyr vendigeit&quot; or &quot;Cadwaladr the Blessed&quot;).

Cadwaladr appears to have suffered a major military defeat at the hands of the West Saxons at Pinhoe near Exeter in 658. He is said to have been of a &quot;peaceful and pious&quot; temperament and to have patronised many churches. The St Cadwaladr&#x27;s Church, Llangadwaladr in Anglesey identifies him as its founder.

The date of Cadwaladr&#x27;s death is uncertain but is thought to be either 664 or 682. Cadwaladr&#x27;s name appears as &#x27;Catgualart&#x27; in a section of the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, where it says he died of a dreadful mortality while he was king. The great plague of 664 is not noted in the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;, but Bede&#x27;s description, makes clear its impact in both Britain and Ireland, where its occurrence is also noted in the &quot;Irish Annals&quot;. The plague of 682 is not noted by Bede, but the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; note its occurrence in Britain and that Cadwaladr was one of its victims. Both the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; and the &quot;Irish Annals&quot; note the plague&#x27;s impact in Ireland in 683, as do other sources.

The genealogies in Jesus College MS. 20 and the Harleian genealogies give Cadwaladr as the son of Cadwallon and the father of Idwal Iwrch. Idwal, who fathered the later king Rhodri Molwynog, may have been his successor.

== Early mythic significance ==
Cadwaladr&#x27;s name is invoked in a number of literary works such as in the &quot;Armes Prydein&quot;, an early 10th-century prophetic poem from the Book of Taliesin. While the poem&#x27;s &quot;Cadwaladr&quot; is an emblematic figure, scholars have taken the view that the Cadwaladr of &quot;Armes Prydein&quot; refers to the historical son of Cadwallon and that already at this stage he &quot;played a messianic role&quot; of some sort, but &quot;its precise nature remains uncertain&quot;. He is typically paired with Conan Meriadoc, the founder of British settlements in Brittany. Conan and Cadwaladr are identified as warriors who will return to restore British power. &quot;Armes Prydein&quot; says, &quot;Splendour of Cadwaladr, shining and bright, defence of armies in desolate places. Truly he [Conan] will come across the waves, the promise of prophecy in the beginning.&quot;

According to Elissa R. Henken, Cadwaladr was well established as a &quot;prophesied deliverer&quot; of the Britons before Geoffrey&#x27;s version of his life altered its ending. This may be because he was seen as the man who would carry forward the achievement of his father Cadwallon, the last great war leader of the Britons: &quot;it is quite likely that the father and son became confused in folk memory, a fusion enhanced by Cadwaladr, whose name is a compound meaning &#x27;battle-leader&#x27;, also having assumed his father&#x27;s epithet Bendigaid (Blessed).&quot;

== Geoffrey of Monmouth ==
Cadwaladr figures prominently in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s romantic account of the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (). As such, the Cadwaladr of Geoffrey is a literary invention that used the name of a historical person to advance the plot of the story. In Book XII, Chapter XIV of the &quot;Historia&quot;, Cadwaladr is given as the last in a line of kings that began with Brutus of Troy. Chapters XV – XVIII have him leaving a depopulated Britain for Brittany, where the British people have resettled. Britain itself has been almost emptied by plague; for eleven years the country was &quot;completely abandoned by all the Britons&quot; except for parts of Wales. Cadwaladr is received as a guest by Alan Hir, King of Brittany. Taking advantage of the depopulation, the Saxons invite more of their countrymen to join them as soon as the plague abates. From this point, they become completely dominant in Britain, and the British come to be called the &quot;Welsh&quot;.

At the same time, in Brittany, Cadwaladr intends to return to take back the island and asks Alan to provide him with an army. The Breton king agrees, but Cadwaladr hears a prophetic voice which tells him that he must sacrifice personal power for the sake of his people. If he renounces the throne, his sacrifice will eventually lead to the restoration of British control of the island in the future, as predicted by Merlin to Vortigern: &quot;the Voice added that, as a reward for its faithfulness, the British people would occupy the island again at some time in the future, once the appointed moment should come&quot;. Cadwaladr is told that if he lives a penitent life he will become a saint. His bones will be hidden to protect them. When his sacred bones are found and returned to Britain, the Britons (Welsh and Bretons) will be restored to full possession of their homeland. Cadwaladr and Alan then consult the prophecies of Merlin and rejoice that this prediction will be fulfilled in future. He then travels to Rome as a pilgrim, where he dies in 689 after meeting the pope.

Thus Cadwaladr becomes a messianic figure who sacrifices himself to redeem his people and restore them to their promised homeland. Cadwaladr&#x27;s penitence assures his sainthood. His son Ivor and his nephew Ynyr return to Britain with an army, but, as predicted, are not successful in restoring British control of the island.

In another passage in the book a list of Merlin&#x27;s prophesies contains the prediction: 
This seems to correspond to the pairing of Cadwaladr and Conan as restorers of Britain in &quot;Armes Prydein&quot;. The merging of the Welsh and Breton peoples is linked to an alliance with &quot;Alban&quot; (which probably means Scotland: Alba). The occupation of the English will be at an end and Britain will be restored to its true identity as the territory of the descendants of Brutus of Troy.

== Cadwaladr and the Wars of the Roses ==
During the Wars of the Roses the prophecies connected to Cadwaladr were used by various contenders as part of their claim to the throne. This was linked to the story of the struggle between the Red Dragon and the White Dragon, part of the myth of Merlin, interpreted as warring Celtic and Saxon peoples. Edward IV claimed to be restoring the authentic ancient lineage of Cadwaladr, thus fulfilling Merlin&#x27;s prophecy of the victory of the Red Dragon. His chancellor gave a sermon asserting that &quot;the British line, which perished with Cadwallader&#x27;s exile in 689 was restored by the arrival of Edward the king prophesied by Merlin and others.&quot;

The Tudors also claimed descent from Cadwaladr to legitimize their authority over Britain as a whole. Owen Tudor claimed descent from Cadwaladr and used a red dragon badge. When Henry Tudor landed in Wales in 1485, he adopted the Red Dragon flag and claimed to be returning in fulfilment of the prophesies of Merlin as recorded by Geoffrey of Monmouth. After his victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field Henry was greeted at the gates of Worcester with a poem asserting:
&lt;poem&gt;
:Cadwallader&#x27;s blood lineally descending,
:Long hath be told of such a prince coming.
:Wherefore friends, if that I shall not lie,
:This same is the fulfiller of the prophesy.
&lt;/poem&gt;
The Welsh Dragon (Red Dragon) came to be known as the &quot;Red Dragon of Cadwallader&quot; and used as Henry&#x27;s personal emblem. Tudor historian Thomas Gardiner created a genealogical roll that gave Henry&#x27;s son, Henry VIII, a pedigree showing his descent from Cadwaladr, referred to as &quot;the laste kynge of that blode from whome by trew and lynyall descensse&quot; the Tudors descended.

== Cadwaladr and Cædwalla ==
Geoffrey&#x27;s account of the pilgrimage of Cadwaladr is believed to derive from a confusion between Cadwaladr and his near-contemporary Cædwalla of Wessex (reigned 685 – 688). He also conflates Cadwaladr&#x27;s son Ivor with Cædwalla&#x27;s successor Ine. According to Bede Cædwalla, king of Wessex, renounced his throne and went to Rome in 688 to be baptised by the pope, dying soon afterwards. Ine took the throne in 689.

The argument that Geoffrey confused Cadwaladr with Cædwalla acquired significance in the late 1570s. At that time, when 
St. Peter&#x27;s in Rome was being rebuilt, the tombstone of Caedwalla was found, confirming Bede&#x27;s story that he had died in Rome. Welshmen in Rome, seeking to validate Geoffrey, claimed that the tomb was that of Cadwaladr. This raised the prospect that his sacred bones could be returned to Britain in fulfilment of the prophecy.

The English critics stated that Geoffrey had simply mixed up the two kings and that Cadwaladr&#x27;s pilgrimage was thus pure fiction. According to Jason Nice, the Welsh &quot;attempt to &quot;prove&quot; the legend of Cadwaladr in Rome belonged to a longstanding tradition that held that Wales&#x27; special relationship with Rome could reinforce Welsh identity and protect Welshmen from English aggression&quot;, a belief that was grounded in the supposed prophecy given to Cadwaladr. Raphael Holinshed summed up the English view in his 1577 &quot;Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland&quot;:

Also traced to Geoffrey&#x27;s fertile imagination are stories of Ivor ap Alan and Ynyr travelling from Brittany to Britain. The choice of names for Ivor and Ynyr in the stories may be a consequence of spurious additions to the Laws of Edward the Confessor, which inaccurately speak of good relations between Wessex and the Welsh in the reign of King Ine of Wessex (reigned 688 – 726).

<doc id="469139" wikidata="Q576669" url="?curid=469139" title="Toby Harris, Baron Harris of Haringey">
<text>Jonathan Toby Harris, Baron Harris of Haringey (born 11 October 1953) is a Labour Party politician in the House of Lords.

== Family and education ==
Harris was born in North London, the son of geneticist Professor Harry Harris and Muriel Harris (née Hargest), a teacher. He was educated at Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Boys&#x27; School, then a direct grant grammar school, which he attended on a local authority free place. He joined the Labour Party when he was sixteen and became Branch Secretary of the Highgate Ward Labour Party while still at school.

Harris went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read Natural Sciences for two years before switching to Economics. Whilst at Cambridge, he continued to be active politically and, like many students, joined all three political clubs so that he could attend their meetings. He was Chair of the Cambridge Fabians and Chair of the Cambridge University Labour Club, before becoming President of the Cambridge Union.

He holds an honorary doctorate from Middlesex University and was for a number of years a visiting professor at London South Bank University.

==Professional career==

After Cambridge, Harris joined the Economics Division of the Bank of England, where he specialised in public sector finance. He also spent a period as Assistant to Christopher Dow, the eminent applied economist, who was then Executive Director of the Bank.

His next job was as Deputy Director of the Electricity Consumers’ Council, where he led the pricing policy and social policy sides of the Council&#x27;s work. He was Deputy Chair of the National Fuel Policy Forum and a member of the Council of Management of Neighbourhood Energy Action.

Harris then became Director of the Association of Community Health Councils for England and Wales, which was then the national statutory body representing the interests of the users of the National Health Service, from 1987 to 1998. He was a member of the Executive Committee of the Patients’ Association and served on various Department of Health bodies, including Openness in the NHS Steering Group, the Mental Health Task Force Group, the NHS Charter Advisors Group, and the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollution.

In 1998, Harris established Toby Harris Associates that provided strategic advice to a wide range of public and private sector organisations. At various times, these included Unisys, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Airwave Solutions, Sunrise Radio, the National Grid and Humana Europe.

He was also for a number of years a Senior Advisor to KPMG, and a Senior Associate of the King&#x27;s Fund, as well as being a Special Advisor to the Board of Transport for London.

He acts as UK Coordinator for the Electric Infrastructure Security Council that brings together the energy industry, lifeline infrastructure providers, central and local government, the voluntary sector and academia to help mitigate the risks of and consequences of a major wide-area and long-duration failure of electricity supplies.

== Political career ==
After university, Harris was National Chair of the Young Fabians and served on the Executive of the Fabian Society and again became active in the London Labour Party, as Chair of Hornsey Constituency Labour Party.

He was elected to London Borough of Haringey Council, as its youngest member, in 1978 and remained a member for 24 years. For five years, he chaired the Council&#x27;s Social Services Committee and was also Labour Group Chief Whip. From 1987 to 1999, he was Leader of the Council, having been elected during a turbulent period of the Council&#x27;s history as its seventh Leader in seven and a half years. He had the task of stabilising the Council&#x27;s finances and dealing with the multimillion-pound overspending under the Bernie Grant leadership. He also had to handle the restoration of Alexandra Palace and the debts incurred on it since Haringey had taken over its ownership from the Greater London Council in 1980.

One of the criticisms during his leadership was the expenses he incurred. Over the course of one year, his expenses were more than £24,000, including more than £15,000 spent on taxis.[3] Although the District Auditor&#x27;s investigation cleared him of any wrongdoing, it was critical of the flaws of the system, which meant that council members were never sent invoices for such expenses and so were not able to check the actual amount that the council was being charged.[4]

In 1993, Labour Council Leaders in London elected Harris as Chair of the Association of London Authorities (ALA) and two years later he led the discussions which led to the merger of the ALA with the London Boroughs Association (which had previously comprised the Conservative and Liberal Democrat led Boroughs) to form the Association of London Government (now London Councils), which he then chaired until he stood down in 2000.

Harris was also active in the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, whose Social Services Committee he chaired, leading the negotiations with central government on the introduction of Care in the Community and the Children Act. When the Local Government Association was formed in 1997, Harris chaired the Labour Group (until 2004).

Harris was an elected member of the London Assembly from 2000 to 2004 representing the Brent and Harrow constituency. He was the Leader of the Labour Group on the Assembly until he lost his seat at the 2004 Assembly election. He was the first chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority Metropolitan Police Authority from 2000 to 2004, overseeing the introduction of police community support officers and neighbourhood policing.

== Public appointments ==
After losing his seat on the London Assembly in 2004, the Home Secretary, David Blunkett, appointed him as the Home Secretary&#x27;s representative on the Metropolitan Police Authority with responsibility for overseeing the work of the Metropolitan Police in countering terrorism and in security.

Harris also chaired the Independent Advisory Group on Deaths in Custody that reports to the Ministry of Justice, the Home Office and the Department of Health from 2009 to 2015.

He has also chaired National Trading Standards which delivers national and regional consumer protection enforcement since 2013 and the Independent Reference Group of the National Crime Agency since 2017.

He is a former Board member of the London Ambulance Service and Transport for London. He was a member of the European Committee of the Regions from 1994 to 2002.

== Parliamentary activities ==

Harris was appointed by Tony Blair as a life peer on 5 August 1998 as Baron Harris of Haringey, &quot;of Hornsey in the London Borough of Haringey&quot; taking his seat in October 1998 as a Labour member. He has been Chair of the Labour Peers’ Group since 2012 (having been vice-chair from 2008 until 2012).

In Parliament, he sits on the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy and is Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Policing. He was Chair of the House of Lords Committee on the Legacy of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games and was also a member of the Lords’ Committee on Personal Internet Security.

==Reviews and inquiry reports==
In 2014, the then Minister for Prisons asked Harris to lead an independent review into the self-inflicted deaths of 87 young people in prison. This was published the following year as the Harris Review: Changing Prisons, Saving Lives and was the most substantial review of penal policy for a generation whose publication was hailed as “a watershed moment” by campaigners.

In 2016, Sadiq Khan as newly elected Mayor of London commissioned Harris to conduct an independent review into London&#x27;s Preparedness to Respond to a Major Terrorist Incident. Most of the recommendations of his review were accepted, although not all had been implemented by the time of the terrorist attacks in London in 2017.

==Charitable activities==

Harris also chaired the Freedom Charity, which educates young people about forced marriage and intervenes to prevent girls being forced to marry against their will, from 2009 to 2014.

Harris chaired the Wembley National Stadium Trust from 1995 until 2018. The Trust successfully led the bid for lottery funding to enable the national stadium to be rebuilt at Wembleyand once the new stadium had reopened distributes 1% of the Stadium&#x27;s turnover to support community sports activities.

He was also at various times a Trustee of the Safer London Foundation, the Evening Standard Blitz Memorial Trust, the Help for Health Trust and Bilimankhwe Arts.

He is a Director of the not-for-profit Cyber Security Challenge.

Since January 2019, he has been Chair of the Fundraising Regulator.

In 2013, a private landowner filed suit against the company and Chesapeake for bid rigging. Justice Department and Michigan authorities were investigating whether state or federal laws were violated; the Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also investigated.

While the case was dropped by the DOJ, Michigan&#x27;s Attorney General followed up on the accusations, and Encana ended up with a fine of $5 million, and Chesapeake paid $25 million into a victim-compensation fund.

===Failed lawsuit by adjacent property owners to prevent drilling===
In 2013, two property owners adjacent to a drilling unit filed suit against the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and Encana for potential harm due to proximity. In October 2013, the judge of the Circuit Court of Ingham County issued an injunction against Encana starting to drill until an administrative hearing before DEQ&#x27;s supervisor of wells had been completed, re part 12 of DEQ&#x27;s rules for oil and gas operations. In May 2014, the supervisor of wells found with Encana, that the petitioners did &quot;not have standing&quot;, because they did not own land within the drilling unit and dismissed the case.

===Alleged excessive water use for hydraulic fracturing===
In November 2013, Ecojustice, the Sierra Club and the Wilderness Committee filed a lawsuit against British Columbia&#x27;s Oil and Gas Commission (OGC) granting Encana Corp. &quot;repeated short-term water permits, a violation of the provincial water act&quot;. The Supreme Court in October 2014 upheld the validity of OGC&#x27;s use of short-term water use approvals on a recurrent basis.

==Criticism==

=== Wyoming water pollution ===
In spring 2008, residents from Pavillion, Wyoming, approached the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) about changes in water quality from their domestic wells. Encana was the primary natural gas producer in the area. In 2009, the EPA announced that it had found hydrocarbon contaminants in residents&#x27; drinking water wells.

===Pipeline explosions===
In Pouce Coupe British Columbia five explosions targeted Encana pipelines between October 2008 and January 2009; media reports indicate the pipeline may have been bombed by a disgruntled community member fearing the sour gas (containing hydrogen sulfide, which can be fatal if too much of it is inhaled) poses a danger to the community. Encana was fined CAD $250,000 under Canada&#x27;s Environmental Emergency Act.

Encana&#x27;s hydraulic fracturing operations in the United States are portrayed in the 2010 documentary, &quot;Gasland&quot;, which alleges that hydraulic fracturing causes pollution of ground and surface water, air, and soil.

===Deep Panuke project===
Issues were raised for the Deep Panuke project offshore of Nova Scotia, when it was proposed in 2006 as a smaller version with increased ocean discharges and when Encana asked for a &quot;streamlined regulatory process&quot; without public hearings.

=== Track record of legal charges ===
In British Columbia, between 2007 and 2019, Ovintiv was charged for breaching provincial legislation 19 times, more than any other company, as well as being fined the highest amount.

<doc id="469158" wikidata="Q5326276" url="?curid=469158" title="Earl of Gainsborough">
<text>Earl of Gainsborough is a title that has been created twice, once in the Peerage of England and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The first creation ended in extinction when the sixth Earl died without heirs. However, the title was revived in 1841 for a female-line relative.

==1682 creation==
Baptist Hicks was a wealthy textile merchant in London and also represented Tavistock and Tewkesbury in the House of Commons. In 1627 he was created a baronet, of Campden in the County of Gloucester, with remainder to heirs male of his body. One year later Hicks was raised to the peerage as Baron Hicks, of Ilmington in the County of Warwick, and Viscount Campden, of Campden in the County of Gloucester, with remainder to his son-in-law Edward Noel, husband of his daughter Juliana. On Lord Campden&#x27;s death the baronetcy became extinct while he was succeeded in the barony and viscountcy according to the special remainder by his son-in-law, the second Viscount. He had earlier represented Rutland in Parliament, and in 1617, twelve years prior to succeeding his father-in-law, he had himself been raised to the peerage as Baron Noel of Ridlington after being raised to a baronetcy, of Brook, in the county of Rutland in 1611. His son, the third Viscount, also sat as a Member of Parliament for Rutland in 1640.

On his death the titles passed to his son, the fourth Viscount. He represented Rutland and Hampshire and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire and of Rutland. In 1681, one year before succeeding his father, he was created Baron Noel, of Titchfield. The following year, one month after his father&#x27;s death, he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Gainsborough. Both titles were created with remainder, failing male issue of his own, to the male issue of his father. Lord Gainsborough&#x27;s son, the second Earl, sat briefly as a Member of Parliament for Hampshire. On his death the line of the first Earl failed. He was succeeded according to the special remainder by his cousin, the third Earl. He was the son of Baptist Noel, the son of the third Viscount Campden from his fourth marriage and half-brother of the first Earl of Gainsborough. All titles became extinct on the death of his grandson, the sixth Earl, in 1798.

Another member of the Hicks family was Sir Michael Hicks (1543–1612), elder brother of the first Viscount Campden. He was the ancestor of the Hicks baronets of Beverston and of the Earls St Aldwyn.

==1841 creation==
 The title was revived in 1841 for Charles Noel, Baron Barham. His grandfather, Charles Middleton was an Admiral in the Royal Navy and also served as First Lord of the Admiralty. In 1781 he was created a baronet, of the Navy, with remainder to his son-in-law Gerard Edwardes (who assumed the surname of Noel by Royal licence in 1798) and in 1805 he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Barham, of Barham Court and of Teston in the County of Kent, with remainder to his daughter Diana, wife of the aforementioned Gerard Edwardes. Lord Barham was succeeded firstly in the baronetcy according to the special remainder by his son-in-law, the second Baronet. He was the son of Gerard Anne Edwardes (died 1773) and his wife Lady Jane Noel, daughter of Baptist Noel, 4th Earl of Gainsborough and sister of Henry Noel, 6th and last Earl of Gainsborough (see above). Gerard Anne Edwardes was the illegitimate son of Lord Anne Hamilton, younger son of James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton. Sir Gerard Noel sat in the House of Commons for nearly fifty years, representing Maidstone and Rutland.

Lord Barham was succeeded secondly in the barony according to the special remainder by his daughter Diana, the second Baroness. Both she and her husband were succeeded by their son, Charles Noel the third Baron and third Baronet. He represented Rutland in Parliament. In 1841 the titles held by his father&#x27;s ancestors was revived when he was created Baron Noel, of Ridlington in the County of Rutland, Viscount Campden, of Campden in the County of Gloucester, and Earl of Gainsborough, in the County of Lincoln. His son, the second Earl, briefly represented Rutland in Parliament and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Rutland. The present holder of the titles is his great-great-grandson, the sixth Earl (the titles having descended from father to son).

The family seat is Exton Hall, near Exton, Rutland.

==Other family members==
Several other members of the Noel family have also gained distinction. William Noel, third son of the second Baronet and Lady Barham, was Member of Parliament for Rutland. Baptist Wriothesley Noel, tenth son of the second Baronet and Lady Barham, was an evangelical clergyman. His second son Ernest Noel was a politician. Gerard Noel, second son of the first Earl, was a Conservative politician. Roden Noel, son of the first Earl by his fourth marriage, was a poet. His son Conrad Noel was a clergyman and prominent Christian Socialist. Lady Victoria Noel, daughter of the first Earl by his fourth marriage, was a philanthropist.

<doc id="469164" wikidata="Q167245" url="?curid=469164" title="Old Course at St Andrews">
<text>The Old Course at St Andrews, also known as the Old Lady or the Grand Old Lady, is considered the oldest golf course in the world. It is a public course over common land in St Andrews, Fife, Scotland, and is held in trust by the St Andrews Links Trust under an act of Parliament. The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews clubhouse sits adjacent to the first tee, although it is but one of many clubs (St Andrews Golf Club, the New Golf Club, St Regulus Ladies Golf Club and the St Rule Club are the others with clubhouses) that have playing privileges on the course, along with some other non-clubhouse owning golf clubs and the general public. Originally known as the &quot;golfing grounds&quot; of St Andrews, it was not until the New Course was opened in 1895 that it became known as the Old Course.

==History==
The Old Course at St Andrews is considered by many to be the &quot;home of golf&quot; because the sport was first played on the links at St Andrews in the early 15th century. Golf was becoming increasingly popular in Scotland until James II of Scotland banned the game in 1457 because he felt that young men were playing too much golf instead of practising their archery. The ban was upheld by James III, and remained in force until 1502, when James IV became a golfer himself and removed the ban.

===Governance===
In 1552, Archbishop John Hamilton gave the townspeople of St Andrews the right to play on the links. In 1754, 22 noblemen, professors, and landowners founded the &quot;Society of St Andrews Golfers&quot;. This society would eventually become the precursor to The R&amp;A which is the governing body for golf everywhere outside of the United States and Mexico. St Andrews Links had a scare when they went bankrupt in 1797. The Town Council of St Andrews decided to allow rabbit farming on the golf course to challenge golf for popularity. Twenty years of legal battling between the golfers and rabbit farmers ended in 1821 when a local landowner and golfer named James Cheape of Strathtyrum bought the land and is credited with saving the links for golf. 

The course evolved without the help of any one architect for many years, though notable contributions to its design were made by Daw Anderson in the 1850s and Old Tom Morris (1865–1908), who designed the 1st and 18th holes. Originally, it was played over the same set of fairways out and back to the same holes. As interest in the game increased, groups of golfers would often be playing the same hole, but going in different directions.

===Influence on modern golf===

The Old Course was pivotal to the development of how the game is played today. For instance, in 1764, the course had 22 holes and the members would play the same hole going out and in with the exception of the 11th and 22nd holes. William St Clair of Roslin as the captain of &quot;The Captain and Gentlemen Golfers&quot; authorized changes to St Andrews on 4 October 1764. He decided that the first four and last four holes on the course were too short and should be combined into four total holes (two in and two out). St Andrews then had 18 holes and that was how the standard of 18 holes was created. Around 1863, Old Tom Morris had the 1st green separated from the 17th green, producing the current 18-hole layout with 7 double greens and 4 single greens. The Old Course is home of The Open Championship, the oldest of golf&#x27;s major championships. The Old Course has hosted this major 30 times since 1873, most recently in 2022. The 30 Open Championships that the Old Course has hosted is more than any other course, and The Open is currently played there every five years.

===Old Course and Bobby Jones===
Bobby Jones (who later founded Augusta National) first played St Andrews in the 1921 Open Championship. During the third round, he infamously hit his ball into a bunker on the 11th hole. After he took four swings at the ball and still could not get out, he lost his temper and continued the round, but did not turn in his score card, disqualifying himself. However, he did continue to play in the fourth round. Six years later, when the Open Championship returned to St Andrews, Jones also returned. Not only did he win, he also became the first amateur to win back-to-back Open Championships. He won wire-to-wire, shooting a 285 (7-under-par), which was the lowest score at either a U.S. Open or Open Championship at the time. He ended up winning the tournament by a decisive six strokes.

In 1930, Jones returned to St Andrews for the British Amateur. He won, beating Roger Wethered by a score of 7 and 6 in the final match. He subsequently won the other three majors, making him the only man in the history of the sport to win the Grand Slam. Jones went on to fall in love with the Old Course for the rest of his life. Years later, he said &quot;If I had to select one course upon which to play the match of my life, I should have selected the Old Course.&quot; In 1958 the town of St Andrews gave Jones the key to the city; he was only the second American to receive the honour (after Benjamin Franklin in 1759). After he received the key, he said &quot;I could take out of my life everything but my experiences here in St Andrews and I would still have had a rich and full life.&quot;

==Features and hazards==
ESPN has said of the course, &quot;No other golf course has as many famous landmarks as St. Andrews, its 112 bunkers and endless hills and hollows have been cursed for centuries, and many have their own names and legends.&quot; In 1949, the last bunker to be filled in on the course was Hull bunker on the 15th fairway.

<doc id="469168" wikidata="Q676658" url="?curid=469168" title="Meg Hillier">
<text>Dame Margaret Olivia Hillier (born 14 February 1969), known as Meg Hillier, is a British Labour and Co-operative politician who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Hackney South and Shoreditch since 2005. Hillier was a junior government minister from 2007 until 2010 and was succeeded by Caroline Flint as Shadow Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change in the Labour Party October 2011 reshuffle. She has been the chair of the Treasury Select Committee since 2024, having previously chaired the Public Accounts Committee from 2015 to 2024.

==Early life and career==
Margaret Hillier was born on 14 February 1969 in Hampstead, and educated at Portsmouth High School, a private school for girls in Southsea, Hampshire. She then went to St Hilda&#x27;s College at the University of Oxford, where she read Philosophy, Politics and Economics. During her time there she was elected Librarian of the Oxford Union Society.

Hillier worked as a journalist in regional press and social housing media and was elected as a Councillor in the London Borough of Islington in 1994, representing the Sussex ward and serving as Mayor of Islington in 1998, before standing down from the Council in 2002. She was elected as a founding Member of the London Assembly for North East London at the first London Assembly election of 2000, serving on the Assembly until 2004, and was a board member of Transport for London until her election to Parliament. 

Hillier served as Trustee of the War Memorials Trust from November 2001 until 2016.

==Parliamentary career==
In 2004, Hillier was selected as the Labour prospective parliamentary candidate to contest Hackney South and Shoreditch through an all-women shortlist. At the 2005 general election, she was elected to the House of Commons as MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, winning with 52.9% of the vote and a majority of 10,204. Hillier made her maiden speech on 24 May 2005, noting there were more men in the House of Commons that day than there had ever been women MPs.

Hillier served as member of the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee for a year until she was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Ruth Kelly in 2006. In June 2007, she was appointed a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office.

During maternity leave beginning in March 2009, her ministerial role was taken over by Shahid Malik. In March 2008, Hillier voted with the Government in favour of nationwide Post Office closures, including seven in Hackney, of which her constituency forms a part.

In December 2009, while promoting the National Identity Card scheme as Identity Minister in Liverpool, she admitted she had forgotten her own ID card, attributing the error to the demands of looking after her baby.

At the 2010 general election, Hillier was re-elected as MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch with an increased vote share of 55.7% and an increased majority of 14,288. She was again re-elected at the 2015 general election with an increased vote share of 64.4% and an increased majority of 24,213.

In June 2015, Hillier was elected Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) in succession to Margaret Hodge. She was, as a result, among the 100 most influential people in the NHS according to the &quot;Health Service Journal&quot; in 2016. As chair, she has been critical of the Troubled Families programme, saying that the PAC&#x27;s conclusions on the programme were &quot;far more serious&quot; than &quot;a slap on the wrist&quot; for ministers.

An ardent supporter of the Remain campaign during the 2016 EU referendum, Hillier announced that she was &quot;devastated&quot; that the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union and that the decision was fuelled by &quot;xenophobic undertones&quot;.

She supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour Party leadership election.

Hillier was again re-elected at the snap 2017 general election with an increased vote share of 79.4% and an increased majority of 37,931.

She stood for election as Speaker of the House of Commons during the 2019 Speaker election. However, she was unsuccessful, securing 10 votes (or 1.8%) in the first round, and coming in 7th out of seven candidates.

At the 2019 general election, Hillier was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 73.3% and a decreased majority of 33,985.

<text>Dame Diana Ruth Johnson (born 25 July 1966) is a British politician who has served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Kingston upon Hull North since the 2005 general election. A member of the Labour Party, she has served as Minister of State for Policing, Fire and Crime Prevention since July 2024. 

During the Brown ministry, she served as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Schools in the Department for Children, Schools and Families, as well as being an Assistant Government Whip.

==Early life==
Johnson was born in Northwich, Cheshire. After returning from wartime service in the Navy her father, Eric Johnson, founded the Eric Johnson electrical engineering company in Little Leigh near Northwich, Cheshire (now continued by his son). She passed the Eleven plus and attended the Northwich County Grammar School for Girls (later the County High School Leftwich). At sixth form level she studied at Sir John Deane&#x27;s College from 1982 to 1984 where she studied History, English and Economics.

She gained an LLB in Law from Queen Mary University of London. She became a barrister in 1991. From 1999 to 2005, she was a Barrister in Law at Paddington Law Centre.

Johnson was a councillor in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets from 1994 to 2002, serving as Chair of Social services. She became a member of the London Assembly on 1 March 2003 after the resignation of Trevor Phillips who became chair of the Commission for Racial Equality, having been next on the list of London-wide members at the 2000 election. She did not stand for re-election in 2004.

==Parliamentary career==
She stood unsuccessfully in Brentwood and Ongar at the 2001 general election.

At the 2005 general election, she was elected Labour Member of Parliament for the Kingston upon Hull North constituency, succeeding veteran Labour MP Kevin McNamara. She is Hull&#x27;s first female MP.

In November 2005 Johnson was appointed as a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of State for Pensions Reform, Stephen Timms. In 2007 she left this role to become an assistant Government Whip. She took on the additional role of Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Schools in the reshuffle of June 2009.

During the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal it was revealed that Johnson had claimed £987 in architects&#x27; fees for her second home, which she voluntarily repaid, and had a £563 claim for crockery rejected as &quot;excessive&quot;.
In the 2010 general election Johnson polled 39.2% of the vote and held onto the Hull North constituency for Labour with her majority reduced to 641 votes.

In 2014, Johnson proposed a Bill under the Ten Minute Rule that would require sex and relationships education, including discussions around issues such as consent, to be made a compulsory part of the National Curriculum

Johnson was appointed in September 2015 by Jeremy Corbyn, shortly after he became Labour party leader, as a shadow minister in the Foreign and Commonwealth team. In late June 2016, along with colleagues, she resigned as a shadow minister, unhappy at Corbyn&#x27;s leadership following the &#x27;leave&#x27; vote in the European membership referendum. She supported Owen Smith in the 2016 Labour leadership election.

She is co-chair of the APPG on Haemophilia and Contaminated Blood, campaigned on the Contaminated Blood Scandal and, in November 2018, received the Political Studies Association&#x27;s &#x27;Backbencher of the Year&#x27; award in recognition of her efforts.

In September 2019, Johnson became the first Labour MP to face a full reselection process by her local party after members voted that she should face a challenge. On 25 October 2019, Johnson&#x27;s local party voted by 292 votes to 101 to reselect her as the candidate for the next election. She was re-elected in the 2019 general election.

== Political positions ==

=== Prostitution ===
On 9 December 2020, Johnson introduced a Ten Minute Rule bill that would introduce the Nordic model approach to prostitution, which would criminalise those paying for sex and criminalise websites which advertise prostitution. The bill was strongly criticised and opposed by sex workers including the English Collective of Prostitutes group, women&#x27;s rights organisations, trade unions, Amnesty International and thousands of individuals, who argued that this legislation would push the industry underground and put sex workers in danger.

=== Israel ===
In September 2020, Johnson was appointed a vice-chair of Labour Friends of Israel.

In November 2021, Johnson in the &quot;Jewish News&quot; wrote an article supporting a speech by Keir Starmer that opposed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions of Israel. She said &quot;Rejecting anti-Zionist antisemitism means opposing the BDS movement which demonises and delegitimises Israel, singling it out for boycotts and sanctions.&quot;

=== Abortion ===

In July 2021, Diana Johnson proposed an amendment that would liberalise abortion in England and Wales. Proponents of the amendment suggested this would bring English and Welsh law in line with recent legislative changes in Northern Ireland. However, Johnson was strongly criticised for not clarifying whether this would allow for abortion up until birth. It has also been suggested by pro-life organisations that this would have removed the requirement for a doctor to be involved, allow for sex selective abortion and removed conscience protections for those medical professionals who object to abortion. 

Johnson was also criticised by 800 medical professionals in a letter that suggested such an amendment would remove legal safeguards for both the mother and child and pointed out that extensions to the 24 week limit were only supported by 1% of the UK population according to a recent Savanta ComRes poll. Johnson received little support in Parliament for the amendment and was also criticised by some pro-choice politicians . Johnson declined to take the amendment to a vote.

In 2024, Johnson&#x27;s amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill, which would decriminalise women themselves in relation to their own pregnancies but would leave the rest of abortion law and regulation unchanged, has been backed by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the British Medical Association, Mumsnet, and many groups who work with survivors of gender based violence such as Women&#x27;s Aid and Karma Nirvana. Conservative Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, who has previously backed a reduction in abortion time limits, has indicated he may support her amendment. The Health Secretary Victoria Atkins has also suggested she may vote for the amendment.

=== Brexit ===
Johnson supported the indicative Parliamentary votes on Brexit and her local paper Hull Live reported that she had been threatened along with fellow Hull MP Emma Hardy on social media with being &quot;shot and hanged&quot; for this position.

=== Votes at 16 ===
In 2017, Johnson co-sponsored a Bill in Parliament that would have granted 16-year-olds the right to vote in Parliamentary elections.

== Honours ==
Johnson was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for charitable and political service, in part for her campaigning on contaminated blood transfusions. She was appointed to the Privy Council on 10 March 2021.

<text>Valerie Shawcross is a British politician who served as Deputy Mayor of London for Transport from 2016 to 2018. A member of the Labour Co-operative parties, she was Member of the London Assembly for Lambeth and Southwark from 2000 to 2016. 

Shawcross was a Member of Croydon London Borough Council from 1994 to 2000, and served as Leader of the Council from 1997 to 2000. She unsuccessfully stood, as the Labour candidate, to become Mayor of Croydon in 2022.

== Early life and education ==

Born on Langley Council Estate, Middleton, Shawcross attended local state schools before gaining a 2:1 degree in Political Theory and Institutions from the University of Liverpool. She joined the Labour Party aged 19. 

Elected as the Deputy President of the Guild of Undergraduates in 1980, she moved to London in 1981 to take up a post at the UK Council for Students Affairs - UKCOSA (Charity). She gained an MA in Human Rights and Education at the London Institute in 1986.

== Political career ==

=== Croydon Council ===
She served as a councillor for New Addington in Croydon from 1994 to 2000, serving as chair of education and later as leader of Croydon London Borough Council from 1997 to 2000.

=== London Assembly and Deputy Mayoralty ===
She was first elected to the London Assembly in 2000, and retained her seat in subsequent elections. In 2000, the mayor of London Ken Livingstone appointed her as the chair of the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA). She accepted the appointment on the condition that she would &quot;consider herself bound by Labour&#x27;s policies and not the mayor&#x27;s&quot;, with Livingstone at the time being an independent politician. In his memoir, Livingstone wrote that she &quot;spent the next eight years transforming the London Fire Brigade, leading to a dramatic reduction in loss of life from fires, cutting waste and, later, organising emergency response procedures after 9/11&quot;. At the same time, she served as the Labour group&#x27;s spokesperson for transport and as chair of the London Assembly Transport Committee. She also served on the Assembly Budget Scrutiny Committee, and chaired the audit committee immediately following her election.

On 7 December 2010, it was announced that Shawcross would be Livingstone&#x27;s running-mate in the 2012 London mayoral election, Ken Livingstone. Shawcross unsuccessfully sought selection as the Labour candidate for the 2012 Croydon North by-election, with Steve Reed becoming the candidate and winning the seat. In 2015, she announced that she would not seek re-election to the London Assembly at the 2016 elections.

In May 2016, Sadiq Khan appointed her as deputy mayor of London for transport and deputy chair of Transport for London. In May 2018, she announced her retirement.

=== Retirement and Croydon Mayoralty ===
Following her retirement from full-time public life in 2018, she worked as chair of the Heathrow Area Transport Forum, and assumed roles in the Thames Festival Trust and Crystal Palace Park Trust.

In October 2021, Shawcross announced her intention to stand to be the first directly elected Mayor of Croydon. She was selected as Croydon Labour&#x27;s 2022 mayoral candidate in December 2021. Shawcross was narrowly defeated by Conservative Jason Perry in the May 2022 Croydon Mayoral election, who won with a majority of less than 600 votes in the second round. Her campaign was damaged by dissatisfaction with the Labour-held Council, which had led the borough into bankruptcy.

== Honours and awards ==
Shawcross was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2002 Birthday Honours for her services to local government. She was made an Honorary Alderwoman of the London Borough of Croydon in 2019, and is a Freewoman of the City of London. She has been recognised for her work in Transport in London by the business group ‘London First’, the ‘London Cycling Campaign&#x27;, and the disability campaign group ‘Transport for All’. 

== Personal life ==
Shawcross is married to Michael Anteney and has lived in the London Borough of Croydon since 1985.

<text>Hwarang segi (lit. &quot;Annals of Hwarang&quot; or &quot;Generations of the Hwarang&quot;) was a historical record of the Hwarang (lit. flower boys but referring to an elite warrior group of male youth) of the Silla kingdom in ancient Korea. It is said to have been written by Silla historian Kim Daemun 金大問 (fl. 704) in the reign of Seongdeok the Great (r. 702~737).

It was believed lost since the 13th century, resurfaced in 1989 when two handwritten manuscripts were publicly unveiled. These manuscripts, owned by Park Chang-hwa and later by his student Kim Jong-jin, were revealed in two parts: a 32-page extract in 1989 and a 162-page &quot;mother text&quot; in 1995. Both texts, written by Park, detail the lives of the hwarang leaders from the ancient Korean kingdom of Silla. The manuscripts&#x27; authenticity has been rejected by most of scholars considering it as fictional works by Park. Regardless of their origin, the Hwarang segi is significant for its unique perspective on early Korean history.

== History ==
The &quot;Hwarang segi&quot; survived to the time that Kim Busik 金富軾 (1075–1151) compiled the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, but is believed to have been lost since the 13th century, because no reference to the &quot;Hwarang segi&quot; was made after reference to the text found in monk Gakhun&#x27;s 覺訓 &quot;Haedong goseung jeon&quot; 海東高僧傳 (Lives of Eminent Korean Monks, ca. 1215). However, two handwritten manuscripts of a text titled &quot;Hwarang segi&quot; were suddenly made public in 1989. It had been owned by a man named Park Chang-hwa, who worked at the Japanese Imperial Household Library during the Japanese Colonial period. The manuscript was kept by his student, Kim Jong-jin, and Kim&#x27;s wife, Kim Kyung-ja, made it public to the media in 1989. The 32-page excerpt was released at the time and when Hwarang Segi was unveiled, Park had already died. (1889~1962) The first manuscript, which was made public in 1989, is typically called the &quot;extract&quot; (&quot;balchwebon&quot;, 발췌본, 拔萃本), and contains a preface and short accounts of the first fifteen &quot;pungwolju&quot; (풍월주, 風月主) or leaders of the &quot;hwarang&quot;. The second manuscript, which was revealed by Park Chang hwa&#x27;s son in 1995, is usually called &quot;the mother text&quot; (&quot;mobon&quot;, 모본， 母本) and contains a 162-page manuscript. Because the first part of the manuscript was damaged and missing, it begins with a fragmented but fuller account of the fourth &quot;pungwolju&quot;, continues with more detailed accounts of the first fifteen &quot;pungwolju&quot;, and concludes after an account of the thirty-second and final &quot;pungweolju&quot;. Both manuscripts are in the handwriting of Park Chang-hwa 朴昌和(1889–1962), who was skilled in literary Chinese and also worked for the Imperial Library in Tokyo during the Colonial period. The historical validity of these &quot;Hwarang Segi&quot; manuscripts is still in controversy among many scholars of early Korea and Korean studies. Most scholars think of this as a novel although some argue for its authenticity.

For those who argue for the authenticity of the manuscripts, the importance of &quot;Hwarang segi&quot; is that is one of the scarce historical works about Silla by a person of Silla himself, and it is free from Confucian dogma and morality. If the &quot;Hwarang segi&quot; manuscripts are authentic, later historians have based their understanding of Three Kingdoms era on Goryeo Dynasty sources like &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; and &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;. However, even if it turns out to be Park Chang-hwa&#x27;s novel, its value as a historical source is likely to be recognized. For instance, Lee Do Heum from Hanyang University suggested that &quot;Hwarang segi,&quot; written by Park Chang-hwa, could be a manuscript of the original &quot;Hwarang segi,&quot; or a reprint of the original manuscript in later years. 

The manuscript known as the &quot;Hwarang Segi&quot; extract is made of 16 parts; one for the introduction and the fifteen for the biographies of fifteen pungwolju leaders of the hwarang. They are:

<doc id="469201" wikidata="Q7205733" url="?curid=469201" title="Plymax">
<text>Plymax is a composite material. It consists of a thin sheet of metal, such as aluminium, copper, or duralumin, that is bonded to a thicker sheet of plywood, giving it strength and rigidity at a relatively low weight.

Plymax was introduced during the 1920s, quickly spreading throughout Europe and the world by the 1930s. The material has been extensively used in the aviation industry; various military aircraft throughout the 1930s and 1940s made use of the material. Plymax was also adopted by the automotive industry, being used on the bodies of several cars, such as the 1931 Triumph Super 9 and the articulated body of the Trojan Tasker. It has also found use within the construction industry for various large fixtures, typically partitions and doors, as well as by furniture manufacturers for various home furnishings.

==History==
Plymax first emerged during the early 1920s, one of the first compositions was a copper-faced plywood, manufactured by Luterma. The term &#x27;Plymax&#x27; was a registered trademark of Venesta, which introduced the material to the British market. During the 1930s, the material was being extensively used within the architectural and construction sectors, where items such as partitions, doors, cubicals, counters, and stalls were constructed and installed throughout large buildings such as schools, hospitals, offices, and factories.

According to Venesta, the typical metals used in Plymax are steel and aluminium; however, alternatives have included copper, bronze, stainless steel and others. Key qualities of the material are its rigidity and relatively light weight. By itself, each metal sheet lacks stiffness, when paired to the plywood to become a composite, it becomes far more rigid, being similar in principle to that of a steel girder in that the vertical web contributes little to the overall strength in comparison to the flanges set at the top and bottom, but plays a critical role in the rigidity.

Due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, the material attracted the attention of various aircraft manufacturers. One notable example of its use was on the Morane-Saulnier M.S.406, a Second World War-era fighter aircraft that was extensively used by the French Air Force. Various aircraft would adopt the material for portions of their design; in one case, the interior floor of the Handley Page Halifax was composed of Plymax.

Plymax was reportedly once a popular material for furniture use, although its use has somewhat diminished following the arrival of new types of processed woods.

<text>Richard Michael Barnes (born 1 December 1947) is a British politician, who was the Deputy Mayor of London from 2008 to 2012. A former member of the Conservative Party, Barnes served as the Leader of the Conservatives on the London Assembly from 2007 to 2008, and was the Member of the London Assembly (AM) for Ealing and Hillingdon from 2000 to 2012, when he lost his seat to Labour. On 30 September 2014, Barnes defected to the UK Independence Party (UKIP).

==Education==

He was educated at Trinity High School, Northampton, and Wolverhampton Grammar Technical School, where he was head boy, and graduated from the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology with a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics.

==Political career and community involvement==

Barnes was a councillor in the London Borough of Hillingdon from 1982 to 2014 and was leader of that council from 1998, securing the re-election of the Conservative administration with an 11% swing, one of the most remarkable results in a poor year for the party. In 2014, he stood against the Conservatives as an Independent in Harefield but gained only 460 votes, and the two seats there were held by the Conservatives (Henry Higgins &amp; Jane Palmer). In 2018, he again stood as an Independent in Harefield but finished behind the Conservative candidates of Jane Palmer and Henry Higgins, receiving 483 votes.

Barnes was a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority, of which he was at one time deputy chairman. He was elected to the London Assembly when it was created in 2000, representing Ealing and Hillingdon, and was Conservative spokesman on policing. In late 2007 he was elected as Leader of the Conservative group in the Assembly, but on 4 May 2012 he lost his Assembly seat in a shock election result, being beaten in Ealing and Hillingdon by Onkar Sahota.

Law and order, crime and disorder, and London resilience and safety were Barnes&#x27;s foremost interests on the Assembly, and chaired the enquiry into the London bombings of 7 July 2005 and was responsible for its report. This has led to his taking a national and international role in the fight against terrorism, particularly in addressing the ability of urban authorities to build resistance and response mechanisms to potential atrocities. In 2007 he spoke at conferences in both Dubai and New York City.

Barnes is openly gay, and opposed Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988, which stated that a local authority &quot;shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality&quot;. His reputation was tarnished in September 2013 when he inadvertently posted naked pictures of himself on the internet, but he claimed that his account had been hacked.

On 30 September 2014, Barnes announced that he was leaving the Conservative Party to join the UK Independence Party. He was unsuccessful in being selected as the UKIP candidate in the Ruislip, Northwood &amp; Pinner Constituency in May 2015. In 2016 he failed to be selected as the UKIP candidate for London Mayor and also failed to be selected by UKIP in the Ealing &amp; Hillingdon constituency.

==Appointment as statutory Deputy Mayor of London==

After Boris Johnson&#x27;s victory in the 2008 mayoral election, Barnes was appointed on 6 May 2008 as statutory Deputy Mayor of London, making him both the first male and the first LGBT Deputy Mayor of London.

<doc id="469209" wikidata="Q380975" url="?curid=469209" title="Manuel González Flores">
<text>Manuel del Refugio González Flores (17 June 1833 – 8 May 1893) was a Mexican military general and liberal politician who served as the 35th President of Mexico from 1880 to 1884. 

Before initiating his presidential career, González played important roles in the Mexican–American War as a lieutenant, and later in the Reform War as general on the conservative side. In the French intervention in Mexico, González fought for the Mexican Republic under the command of General Porfirio Díaz. He supported Díaz&#x27;s attempts to gain the presidency of Mexico, which succeeded in 1876. He served as Mexican Secretary of War in the Díaz administration from 1878 to 1879. Díaz could not be re-elected to the presidency in 1880, since the basis of his coup against Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada was the principle of no-reelection, so Díaz worked for the election of his political client González, who would be a weak rival should Díaz run again. 

His presidency from 1880 to 1884 is marked by a number of major diplomatic and domestic achievements, which historian Friedrich Katz considers to be no less than &quot;the profound transformation&quot; of Mexico. 

Although the González presidency has been considered corrupt, that assessment is colored by the difficult financial circumstances in 1884 and by Díaz&#x27;s campaign to discredit his successor, paving the way for his own re-election in 1884.

==Early life and military career==
Manuel del Refugio González Flores was born in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico, on 17 June 1833. Some sources state that he was born on 20 of the same month. However, he was baptized on the 18th, a day after his birth, as José Manuel del Refugio González Flores. His parents were Fernando González and Eusebia Flores de la Garza. For part of his childhood, he lived in the ranch El Moquete. His parents supported his education, and he was reportedly a brilliant student. He returned to his birth home after the death of his father. When his mother died, he was left in the care of his uncle, with whom he worked as a merchant.

He began his military career in 1847, fighting the invaders from the United States in the Mexican–American War after they killed his father, a farmer. From 1853 to 1855, he fought with the Conservative forces supporting General Antonio López de Santa Anna. At the time of the Plan de Ayutla in 1854, he was with Conservative General Leonardo Márquez in Oaxaca, fighting against Liberal general Porfirio Díaz.

In 1856, he was wounded at the Battle of Ocotlán (1856), fighting with rebels against President Ignacio Comonfort. In March 1859, he took part in an attack on Veracruz by Conservative General Miguel Miramón, against the legal, Liberal government of President Benito Juárez. In 1860, he took advantage of an amnesty for the Conservatives decreed by Congress and offered his services to the Liberals fighting against Maximilian of Habsburg and the invasion.

González served under the military command of Porfirio Díaz. He participated in the defense of Battle of Puebla Puebla on 5 May 1862 against the French, where the Mexicans won a great and unexpected victory. He was wounded and taken prisoner, but escaped. In 1863, Díaz made him chief of the Army of the center. He fought under Díaz in the battles of Miahuatlán and La Carbonera, Oaxaca.

González was taken prisoner by the French a second time in 1865, but he was paroled and rejoined the Mexican army. In 1867, he participated in the sieges of Puebla (where he lost his right arm) and of Mexico City. On 7 September 1867, after Juárez&#x27;s forces had retaken the capital, Juárez named him military commander of the Federal District and governor of the National Palace, serving from 1871 to 1873. He supported Díaz in revolt under the Plan de la Noria (Díaz&#x27;s 1871 unsuccessful revolt against Juárez) and the Plan of Tuxtepec (his successful 1876 revolt against then-President Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada). Vicente Riva Palacio, liberal politician, intellectual, and military man, served in his government.

On 13 March 1877, he obtained the rank of general of division.

==Political career==
===First Díaz administration===
González Flores became captain of the garrison of the Federal District on 22 November 1877. Díaz named him governor and military commander of Michoacán (1877–79).

He was appointed secretary of war and the navy on 26 March 1878, and resigned on 15 November 1879, at the same time as Secretary of Justice Protasio Tagle.

In January of 1880, Díaz appointed him as Head of the Central and Western Army (), which extended his area of operations from Guanajuato to Baja California. His mission was to end the uprising of supporters of the late Manuel Lozada in the canton of Tepic, Nayarit. On 12 January of the same year, he arrived in Tequila, Jalisco. On 17 January, he arrived in Tepic. His staff during this period included two figures who would later be notable in Mexican history: Colonel Bernardo Reyes, a future general and governor of Nuevo León, and Captain Victoriano Huerta, a future president of Mexico. The methods González Flores used to suppress the uprising in Tepic have been described as &quot;violent and questionable&quot;. On 8 May, he submitted his resignation from his position, as the uprisings in Nayarit and neighboring Sonora had ended, which Díaz accepted.

===Election of 1880===

Porfirio Díaz could not run for re-election in 1880, and chose his comrade-in-arms González as the presidential candidate. The day he first arrived in Tepic for the quelling of that year&#x27;s uprisings, González Flores was greeted with a sumptuous reception, which was intended to promote his presidential campaign. On 5 February 1880, he published a program detailing his policy proposals. González Flores was announced as the winner of the elections on 24 September 1880.

===Presidency===
González Flores served as president from 1 December 1880 to 30 November 1884, both preceded and succeeded by Porfirio Díaz. Díaz was a minister in his government.

González had an ambitious agenda, much of which was a continuation of that of Díaz, seeking economic development. Díaz&#x27;s principal policies were concessions to foreign interests (Europe and especially the U.S.), renewed relations with European powers, and internal peace. Following the long period of political instability since Mexican independence, peace could lay the groundwork for foreign investment and infrastructure development. A slogan for the era of Porfirio Díaz was &quot;order and progress,&quot; which González followed. Key changes in the Mexican legal code opened the way for foreign investment and exports from Mexico. In particular a new mining code (1884) eliminated the state&#x27;s ownership to subsoil rights dating to the colonial era, giving full rights to owners of property to both surface and subsoil rights by legally acquiring land. It &quot;proved to be a bonanza both to Mexican landowners and to foreign investors.&quot; A new land law was also enacted which allowed the government to sell so-called &quot;vacant lands&quot; (&quot;tierras baldías&quot;), initiating a new era of land accumulation in Mexico. Companies surveying public land were compensated with a third of the land deemed &quot;public,&quot; which encouraged more designations of that category and enrichment to private companies. The law also encouraged settlement, He established agricultural and industrial colonies of 1,500 Italians in the state of Puebla.

González boosted spending on the Mexican military by 400% and increased the number of soldiers by 90%; he transformed the rural military police established by Juárez into a loyal force supporting the president. The expanded armed forces and the will to take of northern national territory that Apache Indians de facto controlled saw their final defeat, thereby opening up a region for settlement and economic development. A dispute with Guatemala over Chiapas and Soconusco was resolved peacefully in Mexico&#x27;s favor, securing much of its southern area. However, the rebellious Maya Indians in Yucatan, in a conflict known as the Caste War of Yucatan, continued under González&#x27;s presidency.
 
Under González, Mexico re-established relations with European powers (Britain, France, Germany), which was an important means to offset U.S. power in Mexico as well as gain access to European capital. Mexican relations with Great Britain were renewed, once Mexico recognized the long-standing British bond debt from the Conservative government. The considerable sum of £11.5 million would be a drain on the empty national treasury, with the announcement coming during a financial downturn in Mexico. This concession provoked protests from the Mexican congress, and riots in the capital put down forcefully and brutally, damaging González&#x27;s reputation. Aiding in the economic expansion of Mexico was the founding of the Banco Nacional de México, with French bankers playing an important role. The preference for ties with Europe was reinforced with Mexico&#x27;s adoption on 20 December 1882, of the metric system of measurements, created under French emperor Napoleon, rather than the British/U.S. measurements. 
During his administration, the railway from Mexico City to the border city of Paso del Norte (current Ciudad Juárez) was constructed, a key factor in U.S. investment in Mexico and ending the deliberate policy of keeping the U.S. at bay through the obstacle of the northern desert. Lerdo had delayed the railway expansion northward, saying &quot;Between weakness and strength the desert.&quot; Along with the expansion of the railway network, Mexico inaugurated its first submarine cable.

In 1882, he issued nickel coins, replacing silver coinage, which produced the inflation rate and prompted the devaluation of the currency, provoking riots on 21 December 1883. With his characteristic valor, he appeared before the rioters, actually receiving cheers before he finished speaking.

During his term, the Constitution of 1857 was amended to remove the right of succession to the presidency from the office of president of the Supreme Court, which was how both Benito Juárez and Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada had come to the presidency. Instead, the president of the Senate was named next in succession, or the president of the Permanent Commission, in the event that the Senate was in recess.

At the end of his full four-year term, he stepped down from presidency and was succeeded by Porfirio Díaz, who had not been re-elected to consecutive terms as president, but following the González interregnum, Díaz would remain in power until ousted in 1911 with the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910. Díaz&#x27;s denigration of González&#x27;s achievements as president and the charges of corruption have led to his basic eclipse in Mexican history. His biographer Don M. Coerver&#x27;s full scholarly study of his presidency is an exception.

===After the presidency===
After his term as president, Gonzalez was charged with misappropriation of public funds by the Congress in 1885 and the case was referred to a Grand Jury, but the charges were dropped three years later, on 30 October 1888. Rather than being punished by the legal system, González was elected governor of Guanajuato &quot;unanimously&quot; in 1884 and served three terms in office until his death by pancreatic cancer in 1893,
He made a failed attempt to succeed President Díaz in 1887. He was buried in the &quot;Rotonda de las Personas Ilustres&quot; (Rotunda of Illustrious People) on 8 May 1893.

<text>The Saab 340 is a Swedish twin-engine turboprop aircraft designed and initially produced by Saab AB and Fairchild Aircraft. It is designed to seat 30-36 passengers and, as of July 2018, there were 240 operational aircraft used by 34 different operators.

Under the production arrangement in which production was split 65:35 between Saab and Fairchild, Saab constructed the all-aluminum fuselage and vertical stabilizer along with final assembly of the aircraft in Linköping, Sweden, while Fairchild was responsible for the wings, empennage, and wing-mounted nacelles for the two turboprop engines. After Fairchild ceased this work in 1985, production of these components was transferred to Sweden.

On 25 January 1983, the Saab 340 conducted its maiden flight. During the early 1990s, an enlarged derivative of the airliner, designated as the Saab 2000, was introduced. However, sales of the type declined due to intense competition within the regional aircraft market. Saab decided to cease production of the aircraft.

== Development ==
=== Origins ===
During the 1970s, Swedish aircraft manufacturer Saab AB became increasingly interested in the civil aircraft market. In 1974, the company decided to proceed with developing its first major civilian aircraft, having previously focused almost entirely upon military aircraft. During the late 1970s, internal studies had determined that a short-haul airliner should be optimized to seat around 30 passengers. Likewise, it was decided to make use of turboprop propulsion, which was slower but more economical than turbofan engines, and to optimize the airliner to take advantage of this type of powerplant; this decision may have been influenced by high oil prices during that decade, such as the 1973 oil crisis. According to author Gunnar Eliasson, the selection of a turboprop engine made the type less attractive to airlines than jet-powered competitors, however recognized that the General Electric CT7-5A2 engine picked was quite competitive with the jet engines of that era. As conceived, the airliner was to match the performance of jets within its short-haul role.

Towards the end of the 1970s, the regional airliner venture had become the largest industrial venture in Sweden and was recognized as being too large for Saab to conduct alone. Accordingly, in January 1980, it was announced that Saab had entered into a partnership arrangement with US manufacturer Fairchild Aircraft to develop and produce the upcoming regional airliner. Under this partnership, Fairchild became responsible for the manufacture of sections such as the wings, tail unit, and engine nacelles while Saab was responsible for 75 per cent of the costs of development, system integration and certification. To match the new partnership, the type received the designation of &quot;SF340&quot;. The decision to develop a new generation regional airliner had fortuitously coincided with the removal of control by the US federal government under the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act, an event which would notably contribute to sales of the type during the following decade.

The 340 shared several manufacturing and design techniques that were used in Saab&#x27;s military aircraft, such as the then in-development Saab JAS 39 Gripen multirole combat aircraft. One such technique was eliminating the use of rivets on the aluminum structures, using diffusion bonding instead, to reduce weight. On 25 January 1983, the first SF340 performed its maiden flight. Shortly following its launch onto the market in 1984, the Saab 340 became the best selling commuter aircraft in the world. By 1987, all activity by Fairchild on the programme had ceased, the US company having chosen to curtail its aircraft activities, thus Saab became solely responsible for producing the 340.

=== Further development ===
In 1985, due to Fairchild&#x27;s decision to exit the aircraft manufacturing business following the completion of the first 40 units, Saab dropped the Fairchild name from the project and proceeded to continue aircraft production, referring to the type under the designation &quot;Saab 340A&quot;. A total of 159 A models were manufactured. In 1989, an improved version of the airliner, the second generation &quot;340B&quot;, introduced more powerful engines and wider horizontal stabilizers; later production 340Bs also featured an active noise control system. A total of 200 aircraft were built. In 1994, the final third generation version, the &quot;340B Plus&quot;, was delivered for service and incorporated improvements that were being introduced at the same time upon the larger Saab 2000, itself a derivative of the 340. A total of 100 aircraft were completed, adding up to a total of 300 B models. The Saab 340 typically seated between 30 and 36 passengers, with 34 seats being the most common configuration. The last two 340s built were constructed as older configuration 36-seat aircraft for Japan Air Commuter.

One of the major improvements introduced in the &quot;340B Plus&quot; was the installation of an active noise and vibration control system in the cabin, reducing noise and vibration levels by about ten dB during cruising flight. This optional feature carried over from the 340B was standard in the 340B Plus along with extended wingtips which was an option on the 340B, about 30 aircraft having the WT option. Another change from earlier models was a more modern interior design and the moving of the lavatory compartment from the aft of the passenger cabin to just aft of the flight deck in most 3rd generation units. This increased total available cargo volume as the original location intruded into the cargo bin area. While the active noise control became standard on all Saab 340Bs in 1994, the first-ever 340B Plus (third B+ built) was delivered new to Hazelton Airlines in Australia in 1995, later operating for Rex Airlines, and currently for the Japanese Coast Guard. The system could also be retrofitted onto existing airliners.

During 1997, Saab was releasing pessimistic press releases on the 340 programme, stating that it was considering the potential closure of production line, but also pledged that it would maintain full support to existing customers if this happened. On 24 December 1997, Saab announced that it had decided to terminate production of the 340, which it claimed had lost SKr3 billion ($386.4 million) in the previous three years. By late 1998, as production was being slowed down towards an eventual shut down, Saab stated that it had been holding talks with a number of interested parties, reportedly including Indian and Chinese companies, on the potential sale of the 340 production line to another manufacturer. On 8 June 1999, the final 340 was delivered, by which time nearly 460 aircraft had been delivered. Production of all models of the 340 was terminated in 1999, and Saab ultimately decided to cease all civil aircraft production in 2005.

According to Eliasson, the decision to power the type using turboprop engines rather that jet engines had been provided as one of the reasons for Saab deciding to close down the project; another major factor had been the increasingly competitive and politicized regional airliner market in which various competing airlines were alleged to have substantially benefited from government subsidies, while the Swedish government were unwilling to make such commitments to Saab&#x27;s civil projects. According to authors Sören Eriksson and Harm-Jan Steenhuis, while the 340 had been faster than jet-powered competitors such as the Fokker 100 and British Aerospace 146, it had no clear advantage in terms of payload or range; as the regional airliner market became increasingly crowded, newer types such as the Bombardier CRJ200 and Embraer ERJ 145 family, which did have an advantage over the 340, had led to diminished sales.

=== Derivatives ===
During the early 1980s, Sweden&#x27;s Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) requested that Ericsson, a Swedish electronics company, develop a suitable radar for an airborne early warning (AEW) system. The corresponding system was soon paired with the 340 as a platform. Several military variants of the type were produced, including the &quot;Saab 340 AEW&amp;C, 340AEW-200&quot; &amp; &quot;340AEW-300&quot;, which are AEW and airborne early warning &amp; control (AEW&amp;C) aircraft.

During the 2010s, Saab promoted the 340 in the maritime patrol mission. A specialized variant of the aircraft, designated as the &quot;340 MSA&quot;, was mooted; the proposed patrol aircraft is to be equipped with various sensors and combat systems to be capable of performing both anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare, as well as signals intelligence and long range search and rescue operations. In June 2014, Anders Dahl, head of Saab Singapore, gave a presentation on the 340MSA, and observed that several nations were in talks with Saab on the type, as well as there being increasing demand for such maritime patrol aircraft in Southeast Asia.

== Operational history ==
On 6 June 1984, the Saab 340&#x27;s launch customer, Swiss operator Crossair, received its first 340 aircraft. One week later, the type performed its first flight with paying customers on board; passengers on board this flight included Pope John Paul II.

During 1989, US regional airline American Eagle placed a large order for the type, procuring a total of 50 340Bs along with options for an additional 50 aircraft. However, business conditions and demand for turboprop-powered regional airliner transformed dramatically during the 1990s; this can be perhaps best summarized by AMR Eagle&#x27;s decision in October 1999 to announce its intention to phase out its 340 fleet. Faced with diminished value and demand for the 340, Saab chose to shutter production in 1999.

While production of the type ceased in 1999, Saab continued to develop and heavily market the 340 for various purposes in both the civil and military markets. In July 2001, the company announced that it had launched a new partnership with service provider Piedmont Hawthorne to remarket used regional 340s to corporate customers. In April 2002, it was announced that Canadian company Field Aviation had been contracted by Saab to produce a freighter version of the 340, initially focusing on conversions of the earlier 340A model.

Even after production was terminated, a large number of 340s have remained in commercial service in the following decades. By 2006, there was a resurgence in demand for turboprop-powered airliners, in part due to the rising price of oil; during this year, Saab announced the largest ever leasing deal for the 340, providing a total of 25 340s to Australian operator Rex Airlines. By late 2010, Saab was evaluating the option of extending the certified lifespan of the 340 which, under the Maintenance Review Board program, is typically limited to 60,000 hours; the company believes the maintenance program could be extended to accommodate up to a 75,000 hour limit.

The existing aircraft have remained relatively active and competitive into the following decade. In late 2008, following a merger between US carriers Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines, the latter announced that a new Saab 340 base was being formed in Atlanta, after which the merged airline would replace its inventory of 12 ATR 72s in its regional fleet with 49 former Northwest 340s. During early 2009, Russian operator Polet Flight conducted talks with American Eagle to lease 25 340s to increase its breadth of regional flights.

== Operators ==


As of July 2018, there were 210 Saab 340s in service with 34 operators around the world. Primary operators include Rex Airlines with 52 aircraft and an additional 3 operated by its subsidiary Pel-Air, Silver Airways with 21, PenAir with 13, SprintAir with 12, Link Airways with 11, Pacific Coastal Airlines with 10, Castle Aviation with 6 and an additional 2 operated for PuppySpot, and others with fewer aircraft of the type.
In December 2016, the fleet average is at 35,277 h and 39,446 cycles – a mean 0.89h per flight, less than halfway of its remaining life: the airframe life has been extended from 45,000 to 80,000 flight hours and 90,000 cycles and the Saab 340 should remain in service for another 30 years. Fleet leaders are at 71,268 cycles and 61,867h.

Saab Aerotech developed the Saab 340B to meet regional airline operator requirements for the highest possible standard of passenger comfort at minimum cost. A systematic and logical design process resulted in an aircraft with a pressurized cabin, three-abreast seating and two turboprop engines on a low wing. This aircraft is equipped with an onboard lavatory.
== Accidents and incidents ==

Between 1983 and 2013, there were 13 hull-loss accidents involving the Saab 340 series aircraft, resulting in the deaths of 48 people.

=== Accidents with fatalities ===

* 4 April 1994: KLM Cityhopper Flight 433 stalled and struck the ground while returning to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The pilots incorrectly believed there was a problem with one of their engines. The aircraft broke apart on impact. Three people were killed.
* 19 March 1998: Formosa Airlines Flight 7623, a Saab 340B crashed into the ocean 11 km off the city of Hsinchu in Taiwan, caused by electrical fault and disorientation of crew. 13 people killed.
* 10 January 2000: After taking off from Zürich Airport, Crossair Flight 498 banked steeply and entered a high-speed spiral dive, crashing into a field in Niederhasli. All ten people on board were killed.
* 18 May 2011: Sol Líneas Aéreas Flight 5428 en route from Neuquén to Comodoro Rivadavia, a Saab 340A (LV-CEJ), crashed in Prahuaniyeu, Rio Negro Province, Argentina, causing 22 fatalities.

=== Hull losses ===
* 21 February 1990: The undercarriage was accidentally retracted on a Crossair Saab 340A, on the apron at Zürich Airport. No fatalities, aircraft destroyed. The captain involved (Hans Ulrich Lutz) was killed in Crossair Flight 3597 in 2001.
* 2 January 1993: Express Airlines Saab 340A crashed hard onto the runway at Chisholm-Hibbing Municipal Airport due to wing ice accretion. No fatalities, aircraft destroyed.
* 14 May 1997: Pilots of Regional Líneas Aéreas 340B landing at Francisco de Sá Carneiro Airport were not aware of runway construction work. Aircraft ploughed through trench, shearing off the undercarriage. No deaths.
* 21 March 2000: American Eagle Airlines 340B overshot the runway at Killeen Municipal Airport, crashing into a ditch. No fatalities.
* 6 September 2001: Aerolitoral Airlines 340B made an emergency belly landing in farmland after running out of fuel near the Las Palmas River, in Mexico. No fatalities. Aircraft written off and scrapped.
* 8 June 2005: Shuttle America 340A, operating as United Express Airlines reported undercarriage problems on approach to Washington Dulles International Airport. Undercarriage collapsed on landing, aircraft skidded off the runway, and onto grass. No fatalities, aircraft damaged beyond repair.
* 13 June 2013: SkyBahamas Airlines Flight 9561 from Fort Lauderdale to Marsh Harbour attempted to land on Marsh Harbour&#x27;s runway 09 but touched down hard, bounced four times until the right wing detached, and veered right, off the runway. The Saab SF-340B came to a stop with the right wing fractured and right main gear collapsed. There were no injuries, but the aircraft incurred substantial damage.

<doc id="469213" wikidata="Q1185608" url="?curid=469213" title="Four Treasures of the Tuatha Dé Danann">
<text>In the Mythological Cycle of early Irish literature, the four treasures of the Tuatha Dé Danann are four magical items which the mythological Tuatha Dé Danann are supposed to have brought with them from the four island cities Murias, Falias, Gorias, and Findias when they arrived in Ireland.

==Sources==
Together the four treasures form the subject of at least three Middle Irish texts:
*an anecdote in an interpolated recension of the legendary &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; (&quot;The Book of the Taking of Ireland&quot;), here LG,
*the introduction, interpolated from &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot;, of &quot;Cath Maige Tuired&quot; (&quot;The Second Battle of Mag Tuired&quot;), here CMT, and
*&quot;The Four Jewels&quot;, a later, short text in the Yellow Book of Lecan, consisting of a prose introduction and a poem.
In the 17th century, Geoffrey Keating drew on a version of the former for his &quot;Foras Feasa ar Éirinn&quot;.

==Summary==
The first recension of &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; describes the Tuatha Dé Danann as having resided in &quot;the northern islands of the world&quot;, where they were instructed in the magic arts, before finally moving in dark clouds to Connaught in Ireland. It mentions only the &quot;Lia Fáil&quot; as having been imported from across the sea.

One of the recensions of &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot;, &quot;Cath Maige Tuired&quot; and a separate text elaborate on these events. CMT and LG tell that there were four cities located on the northern islands of the world (&quot;i n-insib tūascertachaib in domain&quot;), called Falias, Gorias, Findias and Murias. &quot;The Four Jewels&quot; also refers to the cities, but appears to locate them at &quot;Lochlann&quot; and contends that the Tuatha Dé crossed the seas in their fleet rather than in a mist. The Tuatha Dé Danann—described as the offspring of Béothach son of Iarbonel—landed here to be instructed in the magic arts, embracing druidry (&quot;druidecht&quot;), knowledge (&quot;fis&quot;), prophecy (&quot;fáitsine&quot;) and skill in magic (&quot;amainsecht&quot;). Each island is said to have had its poet (&quot;fili&quot;) who was skilled in occult arts.

When the Tuatha Dé migrated to Ireland, they are said to have brought four magical instruments from these cities:

A. C. L. Brown and R. S. Loomis equate Lug&#x27;s spear with the &quot;Lúin&quot; of Celtchar, which in &quot;Togail Bruidne Dá Derga&quot; is said to have been discovered in the Battle of Mag Tuired. There is however no sign of a literary tradition which connects the two weapons. A different spear belonging to Lug is the so-called spear of Assal in &quot;Oidheadh Chloinne Tuireann&quot;. It was brought back to Lug by the sons of Tuireann in atonement for their killing of Cian.

<doc id="469220" wikidata="Q749520" url="?curid=469220" title="Frontal lobe">
<text>The frontal lobe is the largest of the four major lobes of the brain in mammals, and is located at the front of each cerebral hemisphere (in front of the parietal lobe and the temporal lobe). It is parted from the parietal lobe by a groove between tissues called the central sulcus and from the temporal lobe by a deeper groove called the lateral sulcus (Sylvian fissure). The most anterior rounded part of the frontal lobe (though not well-defined) is known as the frontal pole, one of the three poles of the cerebrum.

The frontal lobe is covered by the frontal cortex. The frontal cortex includes the premotor cortex and the primary motor cortex – parts of the motor cortex. The front part of the frontal cortex is covered by the prefrontal cortex. The nonprimary motor cortex is a functionally defined portion of the frontal lobe.

There are four principal gyri in the frontal lobe. The precentral gyrus is directly anterior to the central sulcus, running parallel to it and contains the primary motor cortex, which controls voluntary movements of specific body parts. Three horizontally arranged subsections of the frontal gyrus are the superior frontal gyrus, the middle frontal gyrus, and the inferior frontal gyrus. The inferior frontal gyrus is divided into three parts – the orbital part, the triangular part and the opercular part.

The frontal lobe contains most of the dopaminergic neurons in the cerebral cortex. The dopaminergic pathways are associated with reward, attention, short-term memory tasks, planning, and motivation. Dopamine tends to limit and select sensory information coming from the thalamus to the forebrain.

== Structure ==

The frontal lobe is the largest lobe of the brain and makes up about a third of the surface area of each hemisphere. On the lateral surface of each hemisphere, the central sulcus separates the frontal lobe from the parietal lobe. The lateral sulcus separates the frontal lobe from the temporal lobe.

The frontal lobe can be divided into a lateral, polar, orbital (above the orbit; also called basal or ventral), and medial part. Each of these parts consists of a particular gyrus:
* Lateral part: lateral part of the superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus
* Polar part: frontopolar cortex, transverse frontopolar gyri, frontomarginal gyrus.
* Orbital part: Lateral orbital gyrus, anterior orbital gyrus, posterior orbital gyrus, medial orbital gyrus, and gyrus rectus
* Medial part: Medial part of the superior frontal gyrus, cingulate gyrus.

The gyri are separated by sulci. E.g., the precentral gyrus is in front of the central sulcus, and behind the precentral sulcus. The superior and middle frontal gyri are divided by the superior frontal sulcus. The middle and inferior frontal gyri are divided by the inferior frontal sulcus.

In humans the frontal lobe reaches full maturity only after the 20s—the prefrontal cortex, in particular, continues in maturing &#x27;til the second and third decades of life—which, thereafter, marks the cognitive maturity associated with adulthood. A small amount of atrophy, however, is normal in the aging person&#x27;s frontal lobe. Fjell, in 2009, studied atrophy of the brain in people aged 60–91 years. The 142 healthy participants were scanned using MRI. Their results were compared to those of 122 participants with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. A follow-up one year later showed there to have been a marked volumetric decline in those with Alzheimer&#x27;s and a much smaller decline (averaging 0.5%) in the healthy group. These findings corroborate those of Coffey, who in 1992 indicated that the frontal lobe decreases in volume approximately 0.5–1% per year.

The entirety of the frontal cortex can be considered the &quot;action cortex&quot;, much as the posterior cortex is considered the &quot;sensory cortex&quot;. It is devoted to action of one kind or another: skeletal movement, ocular movement, speech control, and the expression of emotions. In humans, the largest part of the frontal cortex, the prefrontal cortex (PFC), is responsible for internal, purposeful mental action, commonly called reasoning or prefrontal synthesis.

The function of the PFC involves the ability to project future consequences that result from current actions. PFC functions also include override and suppression of socially unacceptable responses as well as differentiation of tasks.

The PFC also plays an important part in integrating longer non-task based memories stored across the brain. These are often memories associated with emotions derived from input from the brain&#x27;s limbic system. The frontal lobe modifies those emotions, generally to fit socially acceptable norms.

Psychological tests that measure frontal lobe function include finger tapping (as the frontal lobe controls voluntary movement), the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and measures of language, numeracy skills, and decision making, all of which are controlled by the frontal lobe.

==Clinical significance==

===Damage===
Damage to the frontal lobe can occur in a number of ways and result in many different consequences. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) also known as mini-strokes, and strokes are common causes of frontal lobe damage in older adults (65 and over). These strokes and mini-strokes can occur due to the blockage of blood flow to the brain or as a result of the rupturing of an aneurysm in a cerebral artery. Other ways in which injury can occur include traumatic brain injuries incurred following accidents, diagnoses such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease or Parkinson&#x27;s disease (which cause dementia symptoms), and frontal lobe epilepsy (which can occur at any age). Very often, frontal lobe damage is recognized in those with prenatal alcohol exposure.

====Symptoms====
Common effects of damage to the frontal lobe are varied. Patients who have experienced frontal lobe trauma may know the appropriate response to a situation but display inappropriate responses to those same situations in real life [&quot;&quot;]. Similarly, emotions that are felt may not be expressed in the face or voice. For example, someone who is feeling happy would not smile, and the voice would be devoid of emotion. Along the same lines, though, the person may also exhibit excessive, unwarranted displays of emotion. Depression is common in stroke patients. Also common is a loss of or decrease in motivation. Someone might not want to carry out normal daily activities and would not feel &quot;up to it&quot;. Those who are close to the person who has experienced the damage may notice changes in behavior. The case of Phineas Gage was long considered exemplary of these symptoms, though more recent research has suggested that accounts of his personality change have been poorly evidenced. The frontal lobe is the same part of the brain that is responsible for executive functions such as planning for the future, judgment, decision-making skills, attention span, and inhibition. These functions can decrease in someone whose frontal lobe is damaged.

Consequences that are seen less frequently are also varied. Confabulation may be the most frequently indicated &quot;less common&quot; effect. In the case of confabulation, someone gives false information while maintaining the belief that it is the truth. In a small number of patients, uncharacteristic cheerfulness can be noted. This effect is seen mostly in patients with lesions to the right frontal portion of the brain.

Another infrequent effect is that of reduplicative paramnesia, in which patients believe that the location in which they currently reside is a replica of one located somewhere else. Similarly, those who experience Capgras syndrome after frontal lobe damage believe that an identical &quot;replacement&quot; has taken the identity of a close friend, relative, or other person and is posing as that person. This last effect is seen mostly in schizophrenic patients who also have a neurological disorder in the frontal lobe.

====DNA damage====

In the human frontal cortex, a set of genes undergo reduced expression after age 40 and especially after age 70. This set includes genes that have key functions in synaptic plasticity important in learning and memory, vesicular transport and mitochondrial function. During aging, DNA damage is markedly increased in the promoters of the genes displaying reduced expression in the frontal cortex. In cultured human neurons, these promoters are selectively damaged by oxidative stress.

Individuals with HIV associated neurocognitive disorders accumulate nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage in the frontal cortex.

===Genetic===
A report from the National Institute of Mental Health says a gene variant of (COMT) that reduces dopamine activity in the prefrontal cortex is related to poorer performance and inefficient functioning of that brain region during working memory, tasks, and to a slightly increased risk for schizophrenia.

==History==

=== Psychosurgery ===
In the early 20th century, a medical treatment for mental illness, first developed by Portuguese neurologist Egas Moniz, involved damaging the pathways connecting the frontal lobe to the limbic system. A frontal lobotomy (sometimes called frontal leucotomy) successfully reduced distress but at the cost of often blunting the subject&#x27;s emotions, volition and personality. The indiscriminate use of this psychosurgical procedure, combined with its severe side effects and a mortality rate of 7.4 to 17 per cent, earned it a bad reputation. The frontal lobotomy has largely died out as a psychiatric treatment. More precise psychosurgical procedures are still used, although rarely. They may include anterior capsulotomy (bilateral thermal lesions of the anterior limbs of the internal capsule) or the bilateral cingulotomy (involving lesions of the anterior cingulate gyri) and might be used to treat otherwise untreatable obsessional disorders or clinical depression.

=== Theories of function ===
Theories of frontal lobe function can be separated into four categories:
* Single-process theories, which propose that &quot;damage to a single process or system is responsible for a number of different dysexecutive symptoms&quot;
* Multi-process theories, which propose &quot;that the frontal lobe executive system consists of a number of components that typically work together in everyday actions (heterogeneity of function)&quot;
* Construct-led theories, which propose that &quot;most if not all frontal functions can be explained by one construct (homogeneity of function) such as working memory or inhibition&quot;
* Single-symptom theories, which propose that a specific dysexecutive symptom (e.g., confabulation) is related to the processes and construct of the underlying structures.

Other theories include:
* Stuss (1999) suggests a differentiation into two categories according to homogeneity and heterogeneity of function.
* Grafman&#x27;s managerial knowledge units (MKU) / structured event complex (SEC) approach (cf. Wood &amp; Grafman, 2003)
* Miller &amp; Cohen&#x27;s integrative theory of prefrontal functioning (e.g. Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001)
* Rolls&#x27;s stimulus-reward approach and Stuss&#x27;s anterior attentional functions (Burgess &amp; Simons, 2005; Burgess, 2003; Burke, 2007).

It may be highlighted that the theories described above differ in their focus on certain processes/systems or construct-lets. Stuss (1999) remarks that the question of homogeneity (single construct) or heterogeneity (multiple processes/systems) of function &quot;may represent a problem of semantics and/or incomplete functional analysis rather than an unresolvable dichotomy&quot; (p. 348). However, further research will show if a unified theory of frontal lobe function that fully accounts for the diversity of functions will be available.

==Other primates==
Many scientists had thought that the frontal lobe was disproportionately enlarged in humans compared to other primates. This was thought to be an important feature of human evolution and seen as the primary reason why human cognition differs from that of other primates. However, this view in relation to great apes has since been challenged by neuroimaging studies. Using magnetic resonance imaging to determine the volume of the frontal cortex in humans, all extant ape species, and several monkey species, it was found that the human frontal cortex was not relatively larger than the cortex of other great apes, but was relatively larger than the frontal cortex of lesser apes and the monkeys. The higher cognition of the humans is instead seen to relate to a greater connectedness given by neural tracts that do not affect the cortical volume. This is also evident in the pathways of the language network connecting the frontal and temporal lobes.

<text>The Ardagh Hoard, best known for the Ardagh Chalice, is a hoard of metalwork from the 8th and 9th centuries. Found in 1868 by two young local boys, Jim Quin and Paddy Flanagan, it is now on display in the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin. It consists of the chalice, a much plainer stemmed cup in copper-alloy, and four brooches – three elaborate pseudo-penannular ones, and one a true pennanular brooch of the thistle type; this is the latest object in the hoard, and suggests it may have been deposited around 900 AD.

The chalice ranks with the Book of Kells as one of the finest known works of metal Insular art, indeed of Celtic art in general, and is thought to have been made in the 8th century AD. Elaborate brooches, essentially the same as those worn by important laypeople, appear to have been worn by monastic clergy to fasten vestments of the period.

==Find==

The hoard was found in late September 1868 by two boys, Jim Quin and Paddy Flanagan, digging in a potato field on the south-western side of a &quot;rath&quot; (ring fort) called Reerasta, beside the village of Ardagh, County Limerick, Ireland. Flanagan remained in Ireland and is buried in the Pauper&#x27;s Graveyard in Newcastle West. Quin emigrated to Australia, spending his later years in Melbourne. He is buried in Fawkner Memorial Park in the city following his death there in 1934.

The chalice held the other items, covered merely by a slab of stone; the pieces must have been interred in a hurry, probably temporarily, as though the owner probably intended to return for them at a later time. The age of the brooches found with the chalice is evidence that it was not buried until the Viking period. It was sold to George Butler, Catholic Bishop of Limerick, by Quin&#x27;s mother.

==Chalice==

The chalice is a large, two-handled beaten silver cup, decorated with gold, gilt bronze, brass, lead pewter and enamel, which has been assembled from 354 separate pieces; this complex construction is typical of early Christian Irish metalwork. The main body of the chalice is formed from two hemispheres of sheet silver joined with a rivet hidden by a gilt-bronze band and sits at 7 inches high. The width across its rim is . The names of the apostles are incised in a frieze around the bowl, below a girdle bearing inset gold wirework panels of animals, birds, and geometric interlace. Techniques used include hammering, engraving, lost-wax casting, filigree applique, cloisonné and enamel. Even the underside of the chalice is decorated (photo above).

According to the art historian Lawrence Stone (writing before the discovery of the Derrynaflan Hoard): &quot;Here the Irish artist has shown a capacity for classical restraint by a deliberate decision to prevent the ornamentation from spreading so copiously as to blur the proportions... contrasting markedly with the lavish ornamental spread of the almost contemporary Tara Brooch and the still more elaborate systems of the later period. The bulk of the decoration consists of exquisitely drawn spiral or interlace patterns, given depth by the soldering of two layers of gold thread one on top of the other. At intervals are set cloisonné enamel bosses of blue and red, the complicated manufacture of which shows direct continuity with the Anglo-Saxon jewelers&#x27; craft of the preceding century. But apart from the extraordinary perfection of execution of this elaborate decoration, what gives to the Ardagh Chalice its outstanding position in Irish metalwork is the strictness of the relationship between the simple swelling lines of the cup and its base and the arrangement of the glittering studs, bands, and roundels that adorn its surface.&quot; The standard monograph is L.S. Gógan, &quot;The Ardagh Chalice&quot;.

The chalice is similar to the only other major early Irish example to survive, the Derrynaflan Chalice, found in the neighboring County Tipperary. That was found with a paten and liturgical strainer. At that time the ruling dynasty in Tipperary and most of Munster were the Eóganachta, while their allies and possible cousins the Uí Fidgenti ruled in the Limerick area (see Byrne 2001; Begley 1906). Although the early suggestion that the chalice was fabricated at Clonmacnoise and stolen from there by a Limerick Dane is widely circulated, this is unprovable. A Munster origin is just as likely if not more so given the 1980 discovery of the sister Derrynaflan Hoard. A Clonmacnoise origin is not mentioned at the National Museum of Ireland website.

The chalice was featured on a £1 value definitive postage stamp issued by An Post between 1990 and 1995 as part of the series &quot;Irish Heritage and Treasures&quot; designed by Michael Craig. Two Gaelic Athletic Association trophies are modelled on the Chalice: the O&#x27;Duffy Cup and the Sam Maguire Cup.

<text>Toblerone ( , ) is a Swiss chocolate brand owned by Mondelez International (originally Kraft Foods). It was produced exclusively in Bern, Switzerland, until summer 2022, and since then also in Bratislava, Slovakia. Toblerone is known for its distinctive shape as a series of joined triangular prisms and lettering engraved in the chocolate.

The company was independent from 1899 until 1970, then merged with Suchard, then with Jacobs as Jacobs Suchard, then acquired by Kraft Foods, then by Mondelez International in 2012.

== History ==

The Tobler chocolate factory was founded in 1899 by Emil Baumann (1880–1960) &amp; Theodor Tobler (1876–1941) in Bern. At the time, the Swiss chocolate industry was expanding dramatically as recently invented milk chocolate became widespread. In 1908, Emil Baumann, the cousin of Theodor Tobler, created the unique recipe consisting of milk chocolate including white nougat, almonds, and honey. Theodor Tobler came up with the distinctive triangular shape and packaging. The product&#x27;s name is a combination of Tobler&#x27;s name and the Italian word &quot;torrone&quot; (a type of nougat).
The triangular shape of the Matterhorn in the Swiss Alps/Italian Alps is commonly believed to have given Theodor Tobler his inspiration for the shape of Toblerone. However, according to Theodor&#x27;s sons, the triangular shape originates from a pyramid shape that dancers at the Folies Bergère created as the finale of a show that Theodor saw. Another source of inspiration could have been the similar triangular packaging of the Delta Peter brand. Nevertheless, a silhouette of the Matterhorn appears on the modern Toblerone packaging, as seen in the photo above right. An outline of a bear, the symbol of Bern, is also depicted on the mountain on the packaging.

Theodor Tobler applied for a patent for the Toblerone manufacturing process in Bern in 1909. The Toblerone brand was trademarked the same year, at the Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property in Bern. Albert Einstein, who was working at the institute as a clerk, might have been involved in the patenting. Toblerone was thus the first patented milk chocolate bar. It is probably also one of the oldest candy bars using milk chocolate, although not the first one; the Branche, another iconic product of the Swiss chocolate industry, had been launched a few years earlier.

A Toblerone version made of dark chocolate was launched in 1969. A white version was launched in 1973.

Some early advertisements for Tobler chocolate appeared in the international languages Esperanto and Ido.

The Tobler company was independent for many years. In 1970, it merged with Suchard, the makers of Milka, to become Interfood. After the Tobler &amp; Suchard merger it was decided to create a new and single source for marketing &amp; exporting the various products manufactured by both companies worldwide, Multifood. Max E. Baumann, the son of Emil Baumann, was made director of this new division. Tobler &amp; Suchard companies merged with the Jacobs coffee company in 1982 to create Jacobs Tobler &amp; Suchard. Kraft Foods Inc acquired the majority of Jacobs Suchard, including Toblerone, in 1990; in 2012, it was spun off (alongside several other brands) to Mondelēz.

== Sizes and variants ==
Bar sizes range from ten centimetres to nearly one metre, all similarly proportioned. According to &quot;Schott&#x27;s Food &amp; Drink Miscellany&quot; the sizes and number of peaks for &quot;Toblerones&quot; are as follows:


For the yearly Toblerone &quot;Schoggifest&quot;, a special oversized bar is created to celebrate the bar&#x27;s anniversary. The bar&#x27;s weight represents the years of Toblerone, with the first bar in 2008 weighing 100 kg.

Since the 1970s, other variants of Toblerone have been produced. These include:

; Plain chocolate: In a yellow triangular box (1969)
; Dark chocolate: In a black triangular box
; White chocolate: In a white triangular box (1973)
; Milk chocolate Mint Crisp: In a white/green triangular box (1985)
; Snowtop: Editions with white chocolate peaks, also in a white/silver triangular box
; Filled editions: Milk chocolate with a white chocolate centre (blue triangular box)
; OneByOne: Individually wrapped triangular chunks
; Toblerone Pralines: Released in 1997, a single peaked version in the distinctive beige packaging
; Fruit &amp; Nut: In 2007 with a half purple triangular cardboard box
; Honeycomb crisp: With a half white box with honeycomb pieces pictured on it (2009)
; Crunchy Salted Almond: With honey and almond nougat and salted caramelised almonds
; Berner Bär: 500g milk chocolate bar, with a relief portrait of the Bernese Bear and the Coat of arms of Bern on its face. The only non-triangular Toblerone.
; Toblerone Tobelle: Toblerone thins in a beige triangular box:
; Crispy Coconut: With honey and almond nougat and coconut
; Golden Caramel: Caramel with honey and almond nougat
; Tobler Truffles: Limited edition, with personalizable box (2022)

===2016 size changes===
In 2016, the 400g and 170g bars in the United Kingdom were modified to have two peaks removed and larger gaps between the peaks, which reduced the cost of making the bars by cutting the weight by about 10%, to 360g and 150g, while retaining the same package size and retail price. Other sizes were unaffected. The change was not well received, with one MSP calling for &quot;government action&quot; by the Scottish Parliament over the change. In 2018 the bar reverted to its original shape, and the 170g/150g bar was replaced by a 200g bar.

==Manufacturing==
In the past it was manufactured in other locations including Bedford in England, and Dundee in Scotland from the 1930s up to 1969. In the 1970s and 1980s, it was manufactured under licence in Yugoslavia by Kraš in Zagreb (now in Croatia). 

Producer Mondelez planned to start additional limited production from the end of 2023 in a Slovak factory (known formerly as Figaro) in Bratislava. Swiss rules introduced in 2017 mandate that indicators of Swiss provenance such as packaging stating &quot;Swiss&quot; and showing images typical of Switzerland may not be used, so the bars will be labelled &quot;created in Switzerland&quot;, and the image of the Swiss Matterhorn will be replaced by a &quot;modernised and streamlined mountain logo that aligns with the geometric and triangular aesthetic&quot;.

Ingredients in a traditional Toblerone bar include sugar, whole milk powder, cocoa butter, cocoa mass, honey (3%), milk fat, almonds (1.6%), emulsifier (Soya Lecithin), egg white, flavouring, cocoa solids (28%) and milk solids (14%).

==Similar products==
By 1920, the popular Toblerone recipe already faced competition from other manufacturers, for instance from another Swiss manufacturer, Cailler, who launched the Chocmel tablet that year. Another comparable chocolate made in Switzerland (in this case both for the ingredients and shape) is Mahony, produced by Frey.

A similar product is the Croatian product Kolumbo, made by factory Kraš from Zagreb. This chocolate is also composed of pyramids of hazelnuts and honey. Kraš was producing Toblerone under licence during the 1970s and 1980s.

In July 2017, in response to Toblerone&#x27;s 2016 reduction in size, UK variety store chain Poundland launched its own version of Toblerone called &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, which is larger than the modified Toblerone bar.

== Cultural impact ==

The distinct pyramidal shape of the bar lent its name to the Toblerone line, a series of anti-tank emplacements from World War II era, prevalent in Switzerland&#x27;s border areas.

The interior of the Tobler factory in Switzerland was the location where the title sequence of &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; was filmed. However, the majority of the film was produced in West Germany.

UK comedy character Alan Partridge battled a longstanding addiction to Toblerones, which became a running gag of his TV series.

In 1995, it was revealed that the Swedish politician Mona Sahlin had misused her government-issued credit card for unauthorised purchases. Because she had bought, among many other more expensive items, two bars of Toblerone, pro-Sahlin journalists attempted to downplay her abuse of parliamentary financial privileges as the &quot;Toblerone affair&quot;, but Sahlin was nevertheless forced to step down as a Prime Ministerial candidate. She returned to politics in 1998.

A triangular set of residences for students of the University of Manchester on the Oxford Road, Manchester, England, built in about 1975 are known as the Toblerones.

The largest-sized Toblerone in production is used as a running gag in the 2017 Netflix series &quot;Neo Yokio&quot;.

<text>Brian Coleman FRSA (born 25 June 1961) is a former Independent Conservative politician and a former councillor in the London Borough of Barnet. He was a Conservative Party member of the London Assembly for Barnet and Camden between 2000 and 2012, and in Barnet was Mayor for 2009–2010. He was also chairman and leader of the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA) from May 2008 to 5 May 2012.

Coleman was reprimanded in 2009 and 2011 for sending abusive emails to local residents who criticised him, breaching the council&#x27;s code of conduct. Coleman is widely regarded as the worst politician the Borough of Barnet has ever had.

After being charged with assault in October 2012, Coleman&#x27;s membership of the Conservative Party was suspended. In May 2014, Coleman stood for re-election at the local elections as an independent candidate in the Totteridge ward, but failed to be elected, gaining only 6% of the vote.

==Politics and controversy==
Coleman was a consistent opponent of redevelopment plans by Barnet Football Club, including their proposed move to Copthall Stadium and in May 2013 he said he rejoiced and called for the church bells of Barnet to be rung to celebrate the club&#x27;s demotion from the Football League.

During the subsequent Copthall application by Saracens rugby club, Coleman went on record as saying that his Boris Johnson would never allow Saracens to build a new joint-use community stadium. Both the Council and Boris Johnson passed the application despite Coleman&#x27;s opposition. He was a critic of Hendon Football Club and the London 2012 Olympic Bid.

Following the 7 July 2005 bombings in London, Coleman questioned on radio how safe it was for Londoners to travel by public transport. He is against the proposal for the North and West London Light Railway. In 2009 he said &quot;It&#x27;s not feasible, it won&#x27;t happen. Ideas like this are thought up by men who probably still have a train set in the attic.&quot; In June 2006 he criticised the planned refurbishment of Potter&#x27;s Fields Park (between City Hall and Tower Bridge), saying that it should be replaced by a multi-storey car park

In April 2004 Coleman was against Middlesex University&#x27;s plans to expand its Trent Park campus because it was &quot;a crap university&quot; that could &quot;only attract foreign&quot; students.

It was announced in June 2008 that he was to receive an honorary doctorate from Middlesex University for his &quot;outstanding commitment to the community&quot;.

In August 2006 Coleman criticised protesters against a provision of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 as &quot;sad, mad and bad&quot;. On the restrictions on the right to demonstrate, he stated &quot;It&#x27;s not a matter of free speech – it&#x27;s a matter of a proper way of running a world city&quot;.

In August 2007, residents of New Barnet campaigning on the environmental and transport details connected with the redevelopment of the East Barnet School site (Metropolitan Open Land adjoining the Metropolitan Green Belt), were criticised by Coleman as &quot;idiots&quot; and &quot;the usual Nimby brigade&quot;. The previous month Coleman was the only objector to the erection of a wind turbine at Frith Manor Primary School (opposite Partingdale Lane), as he believed it was &quot;out of character in the green belt&quot;.

In 2002, Coleman announced his intention to seek the Conservative Party nomination to be candidate for Mayor of London, but he was rejected at a very early stage. During the 2005 Conservative Party leadership election, Coleman publicly supported David Davis. In April 2007, Coleman gained some publicity when he claimed that the former prime minister Edward Heath was homosexual and that it was &quot;common knowledge&quot; in the Conservative party that he had been told to keep it secret for the sake of his career. Writing on the website of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; on the issue of outing, he said: &quot;The late Ted Heath managed to obtain the highest office of state after he was supposedly advised to cease his cottaging activities in the 1950s when he became a privy councillor.&quot;

An article by Coleman, &quot;Politics and alcohol&quot; for the &quot;New Statesman&quot; in August 2007 alleged that Sir Ian Blair the Metropolitan Police Commissioner was &quot;somewhat the worse for wear at a number of official functions&quot; and &quot;needed assistance from his protection officers to manage the stairs&quot;. Then-Mayor Ken Livingstone reportedly responded that &quot;The London Assembly should stop giving a platform to a person who in addition to putting out all sorts of smears and gossip is also a dyed-in-the-wool Thatcherite who in no way represents the views of most Londoners&quot;.

In late August 2008, an article by Coleman in the &quot;Barnet Press&quot; caused another minor media storm. He wrote that the British athletes were &quot;tainted with the blood of Tibetans&quot;, and that London mayor Boris Johnson was &quot;forced to go to Beijing to collect the Olympic flag&quot;. Coleman&#x27;s comments received cross-party criticism and the Mayor distanced himself from the remarks made by his fellow Conservative.

==Barnet Council==
Coleman was elected as councillor for the London Borough of Barnet Council&#x27;s Totteridge ward in 1998. Immediately following the local government election in May 2006, Coleman successfully proposed a vote of no confidence in the leader of the borough council, Councillor Brian Salinger, triggering an election in which Salinger was replaced as Leader by Councillor Mike Freer.

Coleman is a former chairman of the Finchley Friends of Israel and remains a member of Conservative Friends of Israel. A governor at two local Secondary Schools, he is also active in the Rotary Club and is a vocal supporter of the rights of Falun Gong practitioners and the Greek Cypriot community.

Coleman was Mayor of Barnet from May 2009 to May 2010.

===First breach of council code of conduct===
In September 2009 Coleman was found to have broken Barnet Council&#x27;s code of conduct. The standards sub-committee upheld an independent report that he had failed to treat others with respect. The complaint was made by a local blogger who had received an email from Coleman calling him an &quot;obsessive, poisonous individual&quot;.

Council leader Mike Freer granted Coleman £10,000 of taxpayers&#x27; money to pay for legal representation during the Standards Committee investigation, as Coleman had rejected the solicitors provided by the council&#x27;s insurance scheme. When the local paper approached Coleman before they published this information, he told them that &quot;This has absolutely nothing to do with me, nothing whatsoever, and if you say otherwise you will be hearing from my solicitor.&quot;

Despite finding Coleman in breach of the code, the standards sub-committee decided not impose any sanction on him. He would be liable to reimburse the council for the legal bill.

===Second breach of council code of conduct===
In 2011 Coleman was again investigated for an alleged breach of Barnet Council&#x27;s code of conduct, this time for a series of abusive emails to four Barnet residents. The council&#x27;s investigator additionally found him to have breached another code in not co-operating with the investigating officer. The Standards Sub-Committee of Barnet Council met on 5 March 2012 to consider the investigator&#x27;s report and found that Coleman had indeed breached the code of conduct in respect of two of the four allegations; he was ordered he write letters of apology within 14 days. A demonstration of support for Coleman&#x27;s views, claiming that the campaign against him was anti-Zionist and anti-Semitic, took place outside the hearing at the Hendon Town Hall.

Coleman appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against the ruling, but his appeal was rejected. Coleman still refused to comply with the tribunal&#x27;s order that he should apologise, as the council was reportedly looking for possible sanctions. Barnet Conservative group leader Richard Cornelius was reported to be furious for Coleman&#x27;s failure to apologise. Barnet Council later sought to recover legal costs arising from his unsuccessful legal defence. Coleman appeared to have apologised at last, after Conservative group leader Cornelius confirmed that he was beginning the process of suspending Coleman from the Conservative group.

===Parking petition===
In February 2012, an East Finchley resident accused Coleman of ignoring a petition with 290 signatures from residents in East Finchley requesting a review into 10-minute free parking arrangements in front of a post office. Coleman said the suggestion was unworkable and would reduce revenue. Martin Buhagiar, group editor of the &quot;North London Times&quot; and &quot;Independent&quot; series newspapers, opined that &quot;Manners maketh man&quot; and that &quot;Coleman seems to enjoy giving taxpayers the impression he does not have any&quot;. He encouraged voters to take action at the ballot box.

===Allowances for Councillors===
In July 2010 Brian Coleman participated in and defended as &quot;sensible&quot; a decision by Barnet&#x27;s Tory Councillors to award large increases in allowances to council cabinet members. This was against a backdrop of a two-year pay freeze for public sector workers and national cabinet members taking a 5% cut in pay and was widely criticised, by Local Government Minister Grant Shapps and others. Conservative Councillor Kate Salinger abstained from voting on the increase and was subsequently removed from several forums, panels and committees she had sat on.

===Pro-car policy===
During his time as a councillor in the London Borough of Barnet, Coleman has built up a reputation as an outspoken supporter of car driving, leading Richard Littlejohn to label him a &quot;hero&quot; for introducing a policy of removing road humps when the roads of Barnet are resurfaced. Coleman quotes the Metropolitan Police and the London Ambulance Service as being supporters of this policy, while road safety critics argue that the policy is reckless and driven by populism and self-promotion.

Coleman was caught by a speed camera exceeding a 30 mph speed limit in Borehamwood in January 2006. He already had nine penalty points on his driving licence. On 9 August 2006 at the St Albans Magistrates&#x27; Court, Coleman was given a further three points on his licence, banned from driving for six months and fined £300.

In August 2007 Coleman received an apology from the BBC after he had complained that the appearance of Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq at the media launch of a London cycling event was political. Speaking at the launch, the then Mayor of London and a Green party assembly member had accused Conservatives of pursuing a pro-car policy.

In February 2009 Coleman commented on a proposed off-road light-rail line that would reconnect the two branches of the Northern Line in Barnet, as well as linking to Ealing Broadway, Wembley, Brent Cross and West Hampstead. He described the scheme as &quot;bonkers&quot; and insulted those in favour of it.

In May 2010 Coleman returned to Barnet&#x27;s Cabinet (after his year as mayor) taking the Environment and Transport portfolio. He stated that his priority would be &quot;roads, roads, roads and roads&quot;.

===Partingdale Lane===
Coleman takes great pride in his campaign to reopen Partingdale Lane, a narrow winding country road with no footway, between Mill Hill and Woodside Park in north London. The lane had been closed to through traffic by Barnet&#x27;s previous Labour council for safety reasons, not least that residents of nearby Woodside Park had been using the road as a high-speed rat-run. The road was reopened in December 2002, before being closed again two months later following a High Court judgement.

Following a £250,000 safety improvement project (including a pavement, traffic islands, 20 mph flashing speed-limit signs and width restrictions) the road was reopened in September 2007. Coleman accused residents of staging one of the two car accidents reported in the weeks following the reopening of Partingdale Lane.

A third collision in Partingdale Lane in May 2008 brought further criticism of Coleman. A Lib Dem councillor commented that &quot;Brian Coleman is like a child with a favourite toy. He just wouldn&#x27;t let this go and his colleagues let him do it to make up for the fact that they&#x27;ll never make him leader of the council.&quot; Coleman, cabinet member for community safety, said he was too busy to comment.

November 2008 saw a fourth crash in Partingdale Lane, when a car forced a parked vehicle into a ditch. A sixth accident requiring attendance of emergency services was reported in April 2009.

==London Assembly==
He was elected to the Assembly at the 2000 election, and retained the seat in both 2004 and 2008, losing it dramatically in 2012 with a swing from a majority of 20,000 to a deficit of 20,000. He served as the first Conservative Chairman of the London Assembly in 2004/05 and again in 2006/07, and was Deputy Chair(man) in 2005/06 and for the 2007/08 session.

As Chairman of the London Assembly, Coleman introduced the old Greater London Council Chairman&#x27;s badge and has made the role considerably more civic-based than previous holders of the post. This has led some critics to label Coleman as &quot;pompous&quot; and &quot;self-important&quot;, not least because of the high number of honorary and civic positions he has held in the past and continues to hold at present.

Coleman&#x27;s politics and style led him to be one of Mayor of London Ken Livingstone&#x27;s principal critics, publicly falling out with the Mayor over the London Borough of Barnet&#x27;s resurfacing policy, congestion charging and Livingstone&#x27;s comments in 2005 likening a Jewish reporter to a concentration camp guard.

On his re-election to the Assembly in May 2008, Coleman made an angry acceptance speech at the count in which he announced that &quot;the king of bling is back&quot; before storming out, accompanied by his mother.

In the 2012 London Assembly election Coleman was defeated by the former Member of Parliament for Hendon, Andrew Dismore, who contested Coleman&#x27;s Barnet and Camden seat for Labour. Coleman was defeated by Dismore, by 74,677 to 53,378 votes, a swing of some 40,000 votes. One of the largest nationwide swings to any Labour candidate in over a decade.

===Taxi fares===
In July 2007 he was criticised by Livingstone for spending £10,000 on taxi fares from 1 April 2006 to 30 March 2007, compared to the average figure for a London Assembly member of around £845. This period coincided with the six months that Coleman was banned from driving.

A GLA audit panel report in October 2007 showed that Coleman had run up taxi expenses of £1740 in the period 1 April 2007 to 31 August 2007. This accounted for one third of all cab expenses for the Mayor and 25 GLA members. He was criticised by Livingstone for &quot;creating a chauffeur service for himself&quot; and by the leader of the Barnet Council Labour group for his &quot;breathtaking arrogance&quot;.

A further GLA audit panel report in March 2008 revealed that Coleman had run up taxi expenses of £4157 in the period 1 April 2007 to 31 December 2007. This accounted for half of all cab expenses for the Mayor and 25 GLA members. Livingstone said &quot;Brian Coleman must explain to Londoners how he can possibly justify spending more on taxis in four weeks than the average Assembly member does in nine months.&quot;

When questioned about his cab fares by the Metro Newspaper, Coleman claimed not to use taxis but thought he was being ferried about in &#x27;an official GLA car&#x27;. They reported that in December 2007 he ran up a £412.50 cab fare on a round-trip from his home in Finchley to a nearby meeting where the driver kept the meter running before taking him to City Hall.

Another GLA audit panel report in July 2008 revealed that Coleman had run up taxi expenses of £8231 in the period 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008. This accounted for nearly half of all the cab expenses of the Mayor and 25 assembly members. On one day alone Coleman ran up a cab bill of £656. Assembly member Jenny Jones said that Coleman justifies the expense because he has taken to wearing gold chains from another era. The London Assembly said all the claims were within guidelines.

===London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority===
Coleman was vice chair of the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority from 2004 to 2008. Following the election of Boris Johnson as mayor in May 2008, Coleman was appointed chairman. An Audit Commission report published in February 2009 noted that &quot;The Chairman is robust and challenging but staff and some external stakeholders find his style too confrontational.&quot;

In August 2008 Coleman claimed that he had been passed over for the post of chair of the Local Government Association fire services management committee due to homophobia by fellow Tories.

Outlining areas of potential cutbacks to a London Assembly committee in September 2008, Coleman suggested that the London Fire Brigade Museum should be closed. He said that &quot;having recently visited the fire brigade museum – we shook the cobwebs off the door as we opened it – I have to say that it is not a museum that is fit for purpose or that in my view contributes anything&quot;, adding &quot;when you&#x27;ve seen one brass helmet you have seen them all&quot;. Coleman&#x27;s outburst prompted a campaign to save the museum. Val Shawcross, former chair of the LFEPA, stated that &quot;Brian Coleman has an almost hysterical approach to the issues&quot;.

===Ted Heath cottaging claim===
In 2007 in a blog in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; Coleman wrote: &quot;The late Ted Heath managed to obtain the highest office of state after he was supposedly advised to cease his cottaging activities in the 1950s when he became a privy councillor&quot; implying that Heath used to have casual gay sex in public lavatories. The blog was written about in both the tabloid and mainstream press, but there was no confirmation of cottaging or of Heath having been warned. The claims were denied by MP Sir Peter Tapsell and Heath&#x27;s friend and MP Derek Conway stated that &quot;if there was some secret, I&#x27;m sure it would be out by now.&quot;

===G20 Protest===
In April 2009 Coleman blamed a protester, Nicky Fisher, attending a vigil following the Death of Ian Tomlinson, who was killed during the G20 protests, as being to blame after being backhanded twice by a police officer and then struck on the legs with a baton. &quot;Nicky Fisher turned up to this protest, which everyone said could be violent. She put herself in this situation – and lo, she was hit. It&#x27;s like going gambling and then complaining that you&#x27;ve lost money.&quot; The officer involved had been suspended pending an investigation into their actions.

===Expenses===
In July 2009 Coleman was the only London Assembly member to refuse to voluntarily publish details of their expense claims in a move towards greater transparency following the Parliamentary expenses scandal. He stated &quot;I won&#x27;t do it voluntarily. It&#x27;s none of the public&#x27;s business&quot;, and that &quot;Politicians with lower expenses tend to be the politicians who do least work. Those with higher expenses are the ones who do most work.&quot; Coleman complied following pressure from Mayor Boris Johnson.

===Comments regarding John Biggs===
A meeting of the London Assembly&#x27;s Business Management and Administration Committee on 22 October 2009 had to be suspended for ten minutes after Coleman interrupted another speaker by shouting &quot;oh shut up you odious toad&quot; and &quot;you are the nastiest most odious little man who is unfortunate enough to serve in public life.&quot; The Committee chairman Jennette Arnold described the comments as &quot;totally outrageous&quot; and &quot;appalling&quot;. Coleman&#x27;s remarks were directed to assembly member John Biggs who stated that they were not acceptable in a public meeting. A complaint was lodged with the Assembly Standards Committee who adjudged Colman&#x27;s conduct had not breached the Code.

===Rent increases===
In October 2011 Coleman reportedly told a single mother facing a rent rise to &quot;live in the real world&quot; and that Councillors simply cannot conjure housing out of thin air and to consider renting in the private sector.

===Conviction for assault===
Coleman was arrested for assault for an incident that took place on 20 September 2012. Helen Michael, a café owner in North Finchley who had actively opposed Coleman&#x27;s policy on parking charges, saw him park his car in a loading bay opposite her café. She claimed that she was filming him on her mobile phone when he noticed her and attempted to grab the camera. A policeman intervened and Coleman then jumped into his car and attempted to drive off with both doors open, hitting a truck before speeding off. Coleman was charged with assault by beating and driving on a road without reasonable consideration.

Coleman pleaded not guilty to the charges of assault by beating and careless driving at Uxbridge Magistrates&#x27; Court on 5 November. On 3 May 2013 he pleaded guilty to the charge of assault and was fined £270 after CCTV footage of the incident was shown in court. He subsequently claimed that he entered a guilty plea as part of a deal to ensure he retained his driving licence.

On 5 June 2013 he was expelled from the Conservative Party but he remained a member of Barnet Council and announced he would seek re-election as an Independent candidate in the 2014 election.

===Further abuse allegations===
On 10 September 2013 Coleman was described as having &#x27;stormed out&#x27; of a Barnet Council meeting after losing an appeal against a ruling that he had broken the members&#x27; code of conduct by failing to treat others with respect. According to a report in the &quot;Edgware and Mill Hill Times&quot; on 13 September he had referred to a psychiatric nurse as &quot;a twat&quot; at a Cabinet meeting and had sent abusive e-mails to the chair of the local branch of Age UK.

Coleman, whilst not denying the allegations, claimed that the procedure was unlawful as the code of conduct had been superseded and that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t give a toss&quot; about the council&#x27;s decision.

==Council of Europe==
From 2005 to 2006, Coleman was a Conservative member of the United Kingdom delegation to the Congress of the Council of Europe. In October 2005, he was sent to observe an election in Armenia.

<doc id="469228" wikidata="Q712017" url="?curid=469228" title="Gerald Moore">
<text>Gerald Moore (30 July 1899 – 13 March 1987) was an English classical pianist best known for his career as a collaborative pianist for many distinguished musicians. Among those with whom he was closely associated were Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Kathleen Ferrier, Elisabeth Schumann, Hans Hotter, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Victoria de los Ángeles and Pablo Casals.

Moore gave lectures on stage, radio and television about musical topics. He also wrote about music, publishing volumes of memoirs and practical guides to interpretation of lieder.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Moore was born in Watford, Hertfordshire, on 30 July 1899, the eldest of four children of David Frank Moore, owner of a men&#x27;s outfitting company, and his wife Chestina, &quot;née&quot; Jones. He was educated at Watford Grammar School, and took piano lessons from a local teacher. Though innately musical, with perfect pitch, Moore was a reluctant piano student: he later said that his mother had to drag him to the piano, &quot;an unwilling, snivelling child – I did not absorb music into my being until my middle twenties.&quot;

When Moore was 13 the family emigrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where he studied with the pianist Michael Hambourg, a former pupil of Anton Rubinstein. Moore was distracted from his musical studies by a strong attraction to Anglo-Catholicism; he thought for some time that he had a vocation to become a priest. In 1915 Hambourg died, after which his son, the cellist Boris Hambourg, took Moore as his accompanist on a tour of forty engagements in western Canada.

On his return to Toronto Moore was engaged as organist at St. Thomas’s Anglican Church, and later as a cinema organist, providing a musical accompaniment to silent films. This post was reasonably remunerative, but Moore described a cinema organ as an &quot;instrument of torture … shar[ing] pride of place for sheer horror with the saxophone, the harmonica and the concertina.&quot; His parents concluded that Toronto was not the place for him to build the career as a pianist that they hoped for. They sent him back to England, to lodge with relatives in London, and pursue his studies with Michael Hambourg&#x27;s pianist son, Mark.

===Early career as accompanist===
While studying with Mark Hambourg, Moore earned money as an accompanist. The director of the Guildhall School of Music, Landon Ronald, heard him play at a recital and advised him to pursue a career as an accompanist. He toured as accompanist for the singer Vladimir Rosing along with pianist Myra Hess in the north of England in late 1922.

In 1921 Moore made his first gramophone recording, accompanying the violinist Renée Chemet for His Master&#x27;s Voice. They made several more recordings together, but Moore&#x27;s preference was for accompanying singers rather than instrumentalists. He recorded frequently with Peter Dawson in the early 1920s, and went on a recital tour of Britain with him; it was Dawson who recommended him to the tenor John Coates, who became an important influence on Moore&#x27;s career.

 Moore credited much of his early success to his five-year partnership with Coates, whom Moore credits with turning him from an indifferent accompanist into one who was sensitive to the music and the soloist, and an equal partner in performance. Another influence, figuring prominently in Moore&#x27;s memoirs, was the pianist Solomon, whose technique Moore admired and studied.

===Peak years===
By the end of the 1930s Moore was so well known as an accompanist that Myra Hess invited him to give a talk about his profession at one of her of lunchtime concerts at the National Gallery. The pianist Joseph Cooper wrote of this, and later similar talks, &quot;He revealed a sense of verbal timing of which any professional comic would be proud. His unique blend of wit and wisdom not only pleased the cognoscenti but also won over ordinary people who had no idea that classical music could be fun.&quot; Moore&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Unashamed Accompanist&quot; (1943), had its origins in these talks.

Moore is credited with doing much to raise the status of accompanist from a subservient role to that of an equal artistic partner. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau wrote in his introduction to the German edition of &quot;The Unashamed Accompanist&quot;, &quot;There is no more of that pale shadow at the keyboard; he is always an equal with his partner&quot;. Moore valiantly protected this status of his art, complaining when accompanists he admired were not given billing in concert. He quoted with disapproval the remark made by a singer to Coenraad V Bos, an accompanist of an earlier generation, &quot;You must have played well today, for I did not notice you.&quot;

It is debatable, however, whether he succeeded in convincing the British Establishment of his time, of the uplifted status of his art. Whereas prominent conductors and singers, for example, in the British musical theatre tended to be awarded knighthoods, in 1954 Moore was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), a lower ranked award.

===Later years===
Moore retired from public performances in 1967, with a farewell concert in which he accompanied three of the singers with whom he was long associated: Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Victoria de los Ángeles and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. This famed concert at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall - recorded by EMI and reissued in 1987 as CDC 749238 - concluded with Moore playing alone — an arrangement for solo piano of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;An die Musik&quot;. He made his last studio recording in 1975.

In his memoirs Moore wrote that his services were not needed at Benjamin Britten&#x27;s Aldeburgh Festival, &quot;as the presiding genius there is the greatest accompanist in the world.&quot; In 1967, the chief music critic of &quot;The Times&quot;, William Mann held that the preeminence was Moore&#x27;s: &quot;the greatest accompanist of his day, and perhaps of all time.&quot; In 2006 &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine invited eminent present-day accompanists to name their &quot;professional&#x27;s professional&quot;; the joint winners were Britten and Moore.

He died at home in the village of Penn, Buckinghamshire in 1987.
