<text>John Coburn Stewart (September 5, 1939 – January 19, 2008) was an American songwriter and singer. He is known for his contributions to the American folk music movement of the 1960s while with the Kingston Trio (1961–1967) and as a popular music songwriter of the Monkees&#x27; No. 1 hit &quot;Daydream Believer&quot; and his own No. 5 hit &quot;Gold&quot; during a solo career spanning 40 years that included almost four dozen albums and more than 600 recorded songs.

== Early life ==
Born in San Diego, Stewart was the son of horse trainer John S. Stewart and spent his childhood and adolescence in Southern California, living mostly in the cities of Pasadena and Claremont. He graduated in 1957 from Pomona Catholic High School, which at the time was a coeducational school. Following graduation from high school, John went on to attend Mt. San Antonio Junior College in Walnut, California, during 1957–1958, when he was active in its music and theater programs. He demonstrated an early talent for music, learning the guitar and banjo. He composed his first song, &quot;Shrunken Head Boogie,&quot; when he was ten years old. In an interview in Michael Oberman&#x27;s &#x27;Music Makers&#x27; column (&quot;The Washington Star&quot;) on 30 October 1971, Stewart said, &quot;I bought a ukulele when I was in Pasadena. I would listen to Sons of the Pioneers records. Tex Ritter really turned me on to music. &#x27;I Love My Rooster&#x27; was Top Ten as far as I was concerned.&quot;

== Musical career ==
Stewart&#x27;s first venture into popular music was with a high school garage band known as Johnny Stewart and the Furies. Influenced by the reigning icons of the day, Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly, the Furies toured southern California colleges and coffee houses, releasing one single in 1957, &quot;Rockin&#x27; Anna,&quot; which was a minor, regional hit.

Following the breakup of the Furies and a short time as a member of the Woodsmen, Stewart teamed up with Gil Robbins (father of actor Tim Robbins) and John Montgomery to form the Cumberland Three, a group patterned after, and heavily influenced by, the increasingly popular Kingston Trio. The major accomplishment of the Cumberland Three was a two-LP set of &quot;Songs from the Civil War&quot;, with the albums containing a compilation of songs from the Confederacy and the Union, respectively. In all, the Cumberland Three released three albums, after which Stewart left the group to join the Kingston Trio, replacing Trio founder Dave Guard in 1961.

=== Kingston Trio years ===
The Kingston Trio had emerged from the relatively crowded San Francisco folk music culture in 1957, using a mixture of calypso, pop, and folk styles, along with several forms of comedy, in their act. Relying on new pop-oriented arrangements of folk music classics as well as some original compositions, the Trio earned their first gold record with &quot;Tom Dooley&quot; and thereby launched a major revival in folk music that led to and influenced the careers of Bob Dylan, Peter, Paul, &amp; Mary, and John Denver, among others. The group had become one of the best-known and best-selling acts on the folk music scene and were enjoying a lucrative recording and touring contract with Capitol Records, having ten albums under their collective belts, when Dave Guard departed the group in 1961 to explore other musical directions. Stewart was selected by the remaining members Nick Reynolds and Bob Shane as Guard&#x27;s successor, bringing with him his respected skills as a musician, composer, and performer.

Reynolds, Shane, and Stewart recorded a dozen albums together, taking the music of the Trio into new directions, including more original material, and performing songs by relative newcomers Tom Paxton, Mason Williams and Gordon Lightfoot.

The pop-folk era began to wane as the music of groups such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and fellow Californians the Beach Boys increasingly dominated the charts, and in 1967 the members of the Kingston Trio decided to disband.

=== Solo career, the post-Trio years ===
Stewart continued to write songs and record for Capitol, while touring as a solo act. It was during this time that he composed the hit &quot;Daydream Believer&quot; for the Monkees, which was a hit for Anne Murray as well, and the closest Stewart came to writing a &quot;standard&quot;. He also wrote &quot;Never Goin&#x27; Back&quot; for the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, which he recorded on his own 1969 album &quot;California Bloodlines&quot;. He later toured with Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s ill-fated 1968 presidential campaign and met and married in 1975 fellow folk singer Buffy Ford (with whom he remained until his death). He recorded a string of albums, including his signature album, &quot;California Bloodlines&quot;, as well as &quot;Willard&quot;, &quot;Cannons in the Rain&quot;, and &quot;Wingless Angels&quot;.

Though usually successful with critics and a core group of fans, Stewart&#x27;s albums were not considered commercial successes; he left Capitol after only two solo releases and was signed by Warner Bros. Records, where he also recorded just two albums before moving on to RCA Records, with whom he released three LPs (including a live performance album, &quot;The Phoenix Concerts&quot;). Stewart followed his release from RCA with a contract at the Robert Stigwood organization, the same organization that serviced the recording contracts for Eric Clapton, the Bee Gees, as well as several other disco performers. It was at RSO Records that Stewart enjoyed his most commercially successful years as a solo artist. Teaming up with Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham (then in Fleetwood Mac), Stewart recorded and released &quot;Bombs Away Dream Babies&quot;, which made it to #10 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s album chart and included the #5 hit, &quot;Gold,&quot; in 1979. (Perhaps fittingly, considering the song&#x27;s cynical attitude, Stewart later stopped performing &quot;Gold&quot; in concert, calling it &quot;vapid&quot; and &quot;empty&quot;. The artist further claimed the tune meant nothing to him, having done it for the money and to please his record company.)

Two other tracks from &quot;Bombs Away&quot;, &quot;Midnight Wind&quot; and &quot;Lost Her in the Sun&quot;, also hit the Top 40, making Stewart a sudden pop star at the age of 40. However, the follow-up album, &quot;Dream Babies Go Hollywood&quot; (1980), proved to be a commercial disappointment, hitting only #85 on the album chart. None of the singles from that LP (or any of his subsequent albums) made the Billboard Hot 100, though Stewart continued to perform right up to the time of his death.

=== Later years ===
Stewart&#x27;s later and most significant success was as a songwriter. Several of his songs were recorded by a number of popular acts, including Nanci Griffith (&quot;Sweet Dreams Will Come&quot;), Rosanne Cash (&quot;Runaway Train&quot;, &quot;Dance with the Tiger&quot;), and Joan Baez (&quot;Strange Rivers&quot;). He also continued to record new material, producing CDs on his own &quot;Neon Dreams&quot; label in between commercial releases. They usually coincided with one of his tours. His last album was &quot;The Day the River Sang&quot; in 2006.

In his later years, Stewart teamed up with former Kingston Trio member Nick Reynolds to offer fans the ultimate Trio Fantasy: performing for and with Stewart and Reynolds. In 2005 and 2006 Bob Shane attended and performed a few songs with Stewart and Reynolds at the Trio &quot;Fantasy Camp&quot;, which is held annually in Scottsdale, Arizona.

A tape of Stewart&#x27;s 1969 song &quot;Mother Country&quot; from &quot;California Bloodlines&quot; was played on the Apollo 11 spacecraft during its return to Earth. The production team of CNN&#x27;s 2019 film &quot;Apollo 11&quot; heard the song while listening to archival footage of the flight and included a blend of the astronaut&#x27;s tape with the original studio recording of the tune in the soundtrack as the craft approached the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

In 2001, Stewart was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the World Folk Music Association.

==Personal life==
Stewart had a passion for painting, doing art shows and covers for his recordings and books. He continued to be a prolific songwriter and toured the United States and Europe regularly. He married Julie Koehler in 1960, having three children with her and resided in Marin County, California. He met his second wife, Buffy Ford Stewart, through music and married her in 1975. Stewart&#x27;s brother Mike, who died in 2002, founded the folk-rock group We Five in the mid-1960s. He was the uncle of Jamie Stewart of the band Xiu Xiu.

== Death ==
In 2007, Stewart was diagnosed with the early stages of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, but resolved to continue performing for as long as he was able. On January 19, 2008, he died from a stroke at a San Diego hospital, ten days before a scheduled performance in Scottsdale, Arizona. He was 68 years old.

In addition to his wife, Buffy, he was survived by their son Luke, along with three children from his first marriage: Amy, Jeremy, and Mikael (a sound technician).

<text>NTRU is an open-source public-key cryptosystem that uses lattice-based cryptography to encrypt and decrypt data. It consists of two algorithms: NTRUEncrypt, which is used for encryption, and NTRUSign, which is used for digital signatures. Unlike other popular public-key cryptosystems, it is resistant to attacks using Shor&#x27;s algorithm. NTRUEncrypt was patented, but it was placed in the public domain in 2017. NTRUSign is patented, but it can be used by software under the GPL.

== History ==
The first version of the system, which was called NTRU, was developed in 1996 by mathematicians Jeffrey Hoffstein, Jill Pipher, and Joseph H. Silverman. That same year, the developers of NTRU joined with Daniel Lieman and founded the company NTRU Cryptosystems, Inc., and were given a patent on the cryptosystem. The name &quot;NTRU&quot;, chosen for the company and soon applied to the system as well, was originally derived from the pun &quot;Number Theorists &#x27;R&#x27; Us&quot; or, alternatively, stood for &quot;Number Theory Research Unit&quot;. In 2009, the company was acquired by Security Innovation, a software security corporation. In 2013, Damien Stehle and Ron Steinfeld created a provably secure version of NTRU, which is being studied by a post-quantum crypto group chartered by the European Commission.

In May 2016, Daniel Bernstein, Chitchanok Chuengsatiansup, Tanja Lange and Christine van Vredendaal released NTRU Prime, which adds defenses against potential attack to NTRU by eliminating algebraic structure they considered worrisome. However, after more than 20 years of scrutiny, no concrete approach to attack the original NTRU exploiting its algebraic structure has been found so far.

NTRU became a finalist in the third round of NIST&#x27;s Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization project, whereas NTRU Prime became an alternate candidate.

== Performance ==
At equivalent cryptographic strength, NTRU performs costly private-key operations much faster than RSA does. The time of performing an RSA private operation increases as the cube of the key size, whereas that of an NTRU operation increases quadratically.

In 2010, the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Leuven, noted that &quot;[using] a modern GTX280 GPU, a throughput of up to encryptions per second can be reached at a security level of 256 bits. Comparing this to a symmetric cipher (not a very common comparison), this is only around 20 times slower than a recent AES implementation.&quot;

== Resistance to quantum-computer-based attacks ==
Unlike RSA and elliptic-curve cryptography, NTRU is not known to be vulnerable to attacks on quantum computers. The National Institute of Standards and Technology wrote in a 2009 survey that &quot;[there] are viable alternatives for both public key encryption and signatures that are not vulnerable to Shor&#x27;s Algorithm&quot; and that &quot;[of] the various lattice based cryptographic schemes that have been developed, the NTRU family of cryptographic algorithms appears to be the most practical&quot;. The European Union&#x27;s PQCRYPTO project (Horizon 2020 ICT-645622) is evaluating the provably secure Stehle–Steinfeld version of NTRU (not original NTRU algorithm itself) as a potential European standard. However the Stehle–Steinfeld version of NTRU is &quot;significantly less efficient than the original scheme&quot;.

== Standardization ==
* The standard IEEE Std 1363.1, issued in 2008, standardizes lattice-based public-key cryptography, especially NTRUEncrypt.
* The standard X9.98 standardizes lattice-based public-key cryptography, especially NTRUEncrypt, as part of the X9 standards for the financial services industry.
* The PQCRYPTO project of the European Commission is considering standardization of the provably secure Stehle–Steinfeld version of NTRU.

==Implementations==
Originally, NTRU was only available as a proprietary, for-pay library, and open-source authors were threatened with legal action. It was not until 2011 that the first open-source implementation appeared, and in 2013, Security Innovation exempted open-source projects from having to get a patent license and released an NTRU reference implementation under the GPL v2.

Implementations:
* OpenSSH by default uses NTRU combined with the X25519 ECDH key exchange since August 2022, included in version 9.0.
* The GPL-licensed reference implementation
* A BSD-licensed library
* bouncycastle
* Lokinet was the first onion router implementing NTRU algorithm for its intraweb and End-2-End Encrypted events.
* GoldBug Messenger was the first chat and E-mail client with NTRU algorithm under open-source license, which is based on the Spot-On Encryption Suite Kernels.
* Additionally, wolfSSL provides support for NTRU cipher suites in a lightweight C implementation.

<text>IMT-2000 (International Mobile Telecommunications-2000) is the global standard for third generation (3G) wireless communications as defined by the International Telecommunication Union.

In 1999 ITU approved five radio interfaces for IMT-2000 as a part of the ITU-R M.1457 Recommendation. The five standards are:
* &quot;IMT-2000 CDMA Direct Spread&quot;
** also known as W-CDMA, used in UMTS, the successor to GSM
* &quot;IMT-2000 CDMA Multi-Carrier&quot;
** also known as CDMA2000, the successor to 2G CDMA (IS-95)
* &quot;IMT-2000 CDMA TDD&quot;
** also known as TD-SCDMA
* &quot;IMT-2000 TDMA Single Carrier&quot;
** also known as EDGE, an intermediate 2.5G technology
* &quot;IMT-2000 FDMA/TDMA&quot;

<text>The label Nationalist Conservative was used by several Quebec Members of the House of Commons of Canada (MPs) and several unsuccessful candidates. They used this label in order to distinguish themselves from the British imperialist reputation of the Conservative Party or as a result of disputes with the party.

The three MPs were first elected in the nineteenth century when the term nationalism in Quebec referred to Canadian nationalism, as opposed to British imperialism or a desire for an independent Quebec.

<text>Chuckles are jelly candies coated with a light layer of sugar. They come in five flavors: lime, orange, cherry, lemon, and licorice. Each package of Chuckles contains one piece of each flavor. The candies are made with corn syrup, sugar, modified and unmodified cornstarch, and natural and artificial flavors and colors.

== History ==

The Chuckles brand was first produced in 1921 by Fred W. Amend. The only factory was in Danville, Illinois. Nabisco bought the Chuckles Company in 1970. A management buyout occurred in 1986, and the company was quickly acquired by Leaf. Leaf&#x27;s US properties were sold to The Hershey Company in 1996 and the Chuckles trademark was licensed to Hershey. Hershey sub-licensed Chuckles to Farley&#x27;s &amp; Sathers in 2002, which later merged with Ferrara Pan in 2012 (also owned by Catterton Partners), forming the Ferrara Candy Company. The Chuckles trademark is currently owned by Iconic IP Interests, LLC.

From 1974 to 1975, Chuckles sponsored stuntman Evel Knievel.

<doc id="481669" wikidata="Q5029407" url="?curid=481669" title="Canada Party">
<text>The Canada Party was a short-lived political party in Canada that nominated 56 candidates in the 1993 federal election and one candidate in a 1996 by-election. It was unable to win any seats. The party was populist and ran on a platform of banking and monetary reform. It also advocated direct democracy, referendums and recall elections.

One element of their direct democracy policy was the proposal that the prime minister and cabinet members be elected by the government party&#x27;s caucus in the House of Commons of Canada. The party argued that this would remove the power that the prime minister currently has to command loyalty from caucus members in return for the rewards of more authority in the government, e.g., appointments to Cabinet or to parliamentary secretary positions.

Many of the party&#x27;s supporters were members of the Committee on Monetary and Economic Reform, and later joined the Canadian Action Party. Some had been active in the Canadian social credit movement which shared similar views on monetary reform.

The party was founded by Joseph Thauberger, who had been an unsuccessful Social Credit Party of Canada candidate in the 1972 election. Saskatchewan and British Columbia were the main sources of the party&#x27;s membership. The first national meeting was held in Toronto a few weeks before the 1993 election. The party won 7,506 votes in that election.

During a televised forum of minor party leaders, Thauberger said to Neil Paterson, the leader of the Natural Law Party of Canada, &quot;For the life of me, I can&#x27;t imagine how you expect to meditate away the national debt!&quot;

In 1994, Thauberger stepped down and was replaced by Claire Foss at a meeting in Winnipeg. In the run-up to the 1997 election, the party&#x27;s board voted to support Paul Hellyer&#x27;s Canadian Action Party because of that party&#x27;s support for monetary reform. Foss ran as a CAP candidate in Okanagan—Shuswap, where he received the largest number of votes of any CAP candidate. Foss was also a CAP candidate in the 2004 election; however, he fared poorly at the polls.

<doc id="481671" wikidata="Q638335" url="?curid=481671" title="Fedora">
<text>A fedora () is a hat with a soft brim and indented crown. It is typically creased lengthwise down the crown and &quot;pinched&quot; near the front on both sides. Fedoras can also be creased with teardrop crowns, diamond crowns, center dents, and others, and the positioning of pinches can vary. The typical crown height is . The term &quot;fedora&quot; was in use as early as 1891. Its popularity soared, and eventually it eclipsed the similar-looking homburg.

The fedora hat&#x27;s brim is usually around wide, but can be wider, can be left raw-edged (left as cut), finished with a sewn overwelt or underwelt, or bound with a trim-ribbon. &quot;Stitched edge&quot; means that there is one or more rows of stitching radiating inward toward the crown. The Cavanagh edge is a welted edge with invisible stitching to hold it in place and is a very expensive treatment that requires a highly-skilled craftsman. Fedora hats are not to be confused with small brimmed hats called trilbies.

Fedoras can be made of wool, cashmere, rabbit or beaver felt. These felts can also be blended to each other with mink or chinchilla and rarely with vicuña, guanaco, cervelt, or mohair. They can also be made of straw, cotton, waxed or oiled cotton, hemp, linen or leather.

A special variation is the rollable, foldaway or crushable fedora (rollable and crushable are not the same) with a certain or open crown (open-crown fedoras can be bashed and shaped in many variations). Special fedoras have a ventilated crown with grommets, mesh inlets, or other penetrations for a better air circulation. Fedoras can be lined or unlined and have a leather,cloth, or ribbon sweatband. Small feathers are sometimes added as decoration. Fedoras can be equipped with a chinstrap, but this is uncommon.

==History==
The term &quot;fedora&quot; was in use as early as 1891. Its popularity soared, and eventually it eclipsed the similar-looking homburg.
The word &quot;fedora&quot; comes from the title of an 1882 play by dramatist Victorien Sardou, &quot;Fédora,&quot; which was written for Sarah Bernhardt. The play was first performed in the United States in 1889. Bernhardt played Princess Fédora Romazoff, the heroine of the play. During the play, Bernhardta noted cross-dresserwore a center-creased, soft brimmed hat. The hat was fashionable for women, and the women&#x27;s rights movement adopted it as a symbol. After Edward, Prince of Wales (later the Duke of Windsor) started to wear them in 1924, it became popular among men for its stylishness and its ability to protect the wearer&#x27;s head from the wind and weather. Since the early part of the 20th century, many Haredi and other Orthodox Jews have made black fedoras normal to their daily wear.

=== Fedoras in early American society ===

During the early twentieth century, a hat was a staple of men&#x27;s fashion and would be worn in almost all public places. However, as a social custom and common courtesy, men would remove their hats when at home or when engaged in conversation with women. In addition, the ability to own a hat was culturally considered a sign of wealth due to fashion being recognized as a status symbol. Only those with few economic resources would venture out without a hat. The introduction of a new line of felt hats made from nutria, an animal similar to the beaver, helped establish the fedora as a durable product. Prices, in the first decade of the twentieth century, for a nutria fedora ranged from ninety-eight cents to two dollars and twenty-five cents.
Starting in the 1920s, fedoras began to rise in popularity after the Prince of Wales adopted the felt hat as his favored headwear. As a result, &quot;the soft felt hat replaced the stiff hat as the best seller in the decade&quot;. The fedora soon took its place as a choice hat and joined other popular styles that included the derby and the homburg. 

A notable trend that emerged during the rise in popularity of the fedora was to invert the lid of the hat itself and cut jagged edges across the brim. This style of hat would eventually be called a whoopee cap, and became a popular alternative to the more formal fedora for mechanics and children of the era.

During the 1940s, the brims of fedoras started to increase in width, while the British maintained a slightly smaller brim size. The colors of fedoras traditionally included shades of black, brown, and gray. However, this palette would grow at the onset of the second world war to include military themed colors such as khaki, blue, and green. One of the most prominent companies to sell fedoras was the department store Sears, Roebuck and Company. In addition, famous hat manufacturers which still exist today include Bailey, Borsalino, and Stetson.

=== Women and fedoras ===
In the 1880s, long before the fedora became popular for men, French stage actress Sarah Bernhardt popularized the fedora for a female wearer. 
In the play &quot;Fédora&quot; by the French author Victorien Sardou, Bernhardt played Princess Fédora Romazoff. It soon became a common fashion accessory for many women, particularly among activists campaigning for gender equality during the late nineteenth century. The fedora was eventually adopted as a defining symbol of the women&#x27;s rights movement.

Fedoras continue to be worn by women, but not quite to the same extent as in the early twentieth century. Women&#x27;s fedoras vary in form, texture, and color. In addition, these fedoras come in almost every color from basic black to bright red and even in the occasional animal print. Along with men&#x27;s felt hats, women&#x27;s fedoras were described as making a comeback in an article about 2007 fashion trends. Baseball caps, which had been the staple of headwear, were experiencing a decline in popularity amidst this &quot;fedora renaissance&quot;.

== Make and form ==

Fedoras are usually made by pressing a piece of felt over a mold, and using some kind of heat or sealant to help the felt keep its shape. In the past, molds were created by using a series of wooden blocks to create the shape of the hat, and the felt was pressed on with an iron. The current method is to use metal molds and machinery to create enough pressure to form the shape of the hat. After the general shape of the hat has been achieved, the hat makers attach some sort of decoration, usually a ribbon, between the brim and the crown of the hat. The brim is either left raw, or hemmed. The fedora is considered a soft hat, which means that it is usually constructed from felt, fur, or animal hides. There are variations from hat to hat, but the standard design includes a creased crown, angled brim, a pinch at the top of the hat, and some sort of decoration above the brim of the hat. Men&#x27;s fedoras especially tend to have stylized brims with edges that are turned down in the front and up in the back. As mentioned earlier, the width of the brim, overall size and color of the hats are subject to change with fashion trends. Women&#x27;s hats also tend to have more elaborate decorations and slimmer designs.

Because of the soft nature of the hat, many variations are possible with fedoras. One variation of the hat includes the Stetson playboy hat which was common in the 1940s. The Stetson playboy hat involved a marketing success story, with a simple variation on the general form of the fedora becoming a significant trend in America. Al Capone was fond of the playboy style. Many pictures of Capone depict him sporting a Stetson playboy hat.

Contemporary takes on the fedora include asymmetrical brims, bright colors, eccentric patterns, and flashy decorations. Some fedoras are now made from straw, and other unconventional materials. However, despite the increase of artistic hats, the most commonly worn fedoras are still neutral colored, with simple shape and design.

== In popular culture ==

Coach Tom Landry wore the hat while he was the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys. It would later become his trademark image. A cenotaph dedicated to Landry with a depiction of his fedora was placed in the official Texas State Cemetery in Austin at the family&#x27;s request. In addition the Cowboys wore a patch on their uniforms during the 2000 season depicting Landry&#x27;s fedora. His panel in the Cowboys &quot;Ring of Honor&quot; features a depiction of a fedora where a uniform number is shown for players.

Indiana Jones re-popularized the fedora in the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; franchise. The backstory of how he obtains the hat is told in the prologue of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, the third film of the series, and the character who gives him the hat is credited as &quot;Fedora&quot;.

The character Freddy Krueger, from the &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; franchise, also wears a brown fedora.

The fedora hat of the ninth president of Turkey, Süleyman Demirel, was a famous part of the president&#x27;s image.

Ice hockey coaches often wore one, most notably coaches Punch Imlach, Toe Blake, Billy Reay, and Murray Armstrong.

In the 21st century, the fedora has made a reappearance in the fashion world along with other types of classic hats such as the porkpie and the homburg. In addition, the fedora has appeared in recent portrayals of movies and television shows that are set in the past, such as &quot;Mad Men&quot; (2007–15), &quot;Shutter Island&quot; (2010), and &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot; (2010–14). Michael Jackson also frequently wore a fedora while performing on stage.

By the early 21st century, the fedora had become a symbol of hipsters. &quot;Vice&quot; has referred to the early 2000s as a &quot;fedora renaissance&quot;, with celebrities like Johnny Depp and Peter Doherty wearing the hat. By 2016, the term &quot;fedora&quot; became derisively associated with neckbeard and incel stereotypes in online culture, with Vice stating &quot;fedoras may be the single most-hated fashion accessory money can buy&quot;, despite the fact that the hat in question is nearly always a trilby rather than a fedora. A popular meme featuring actor Jerry Messing tipping a trilby with the dialogue of &quot;M&#x27;lady&quot; is often associated with such spoofs of incel culture. A 2016 issue of &quot;The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl&quot; depicts Marvel Comics villain Mole Man reenacting the &quot;M&#x27;lady&quot; meme on the cover.
=== In film noir ===

The fedora was worn by film actors such as Edward G. Robinson, George Raft and Humphrey Bogart. The fedora was a characteristic of film noir and has been the chosen accessory of movie detectives and criminals alike. It was worn by Bogart as Sam Spade in &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941) and Philip Marlowe in &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1946). Peter Eliopoulos wrote in &quot;The 1930s: The Reality and the Promise&quot;: &quot;The popular Bogart-styled fedora was worn slightly cocked, it was pulled down just above the eye line, so that the wearer peaked beneath the brim and through the cigarette smoke that gathered momentarily before curling itself around the top of the hat.&quot;

Billy Wilder wrote and directed the film &quot;Fedora&quot; (1978), which takes its title from the female lead character played by Marthe Keller. In addition, fedoras are a strong theme throughout the picture. Most of Wilder&#x27;s film&#x27;s feature fedoras prominently in promotional materials as well as in the finished films.

=== Gangsters and jazz ===

Fedoras were much associated with gangsters during Prohibition era in the United States, a connection coinciding with the height of the hat&#x27;s popularity between the 1920s and the early 1950s. In the second half of the 1950s, the fedora fell out of favor in a shift towards more informal clothing styles. In addition, well-known gangsters such as Al Capone, Charles Luciano, and Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel used the fedora to create a &quot;tough guy&quot; image. 

Fedoras were an important accessory to the zoot suit ensemble which emerged onto the American fashion scene during the 1940s. Zoot suits were mainly associated with Mexican and African Americans and were largely worn in segregated minority communities. As a result, this style soon spread to local jazz musicians who adopted this look and brought it to their audiences.

In the movie of the same name, The Blues Brothers (who are blues musicians rather than jazzmen) wear black scant-brim fedoras as part of their black suit &quot;uniform&quot;.

The association of the fedora with the zoot suit and gangster culture has caused the general public to view it according to this limited connotation.

=== Michael Jackson ===
American singer-songwriter Michael Jackson wore fedoras during his iconic performances including Billie Jean, Smooth Criminal, Dangerous and You Rock My World. Moreover, he wore fedoras during his public appearances for fashion aesthetics and covering of his scalded head as a result of combined effects of lupus and the Pepsi incident in 1984. The fedora quickly became his style in the global outreach and people still attribute the hat to him worldwide.

== In religious communities ==
=== Orthodox Jews ===
Devout Orthodox Jewish men fulfil their religious obligation of head-covering with the hats similar to the fedora, a Western-invented headgear. Lithuanian students in the first half of 20th century wore light hats during prayer and sometimes even while studying, as evident in a rare footage of the Ponevezh Yeshiva and a photo of the Lomza Yeshiva, both in Eastern Europe. Both the footage and the photo show students studying in their hats. Hasidic Jews wore black hats, albeit not fedoras, and in the later half of the 20th century, non-Hasidic (Lithuanian style) students began to wear black fedoras (or dark blue or gray). Today, many students and Orthodox men wear black fedoras for prayer and many even while walking outside.

<doc id="481673" wikidata="Q13524" url="?curid=481673" title="Alfred Sauvy">
<text>Alfred Sauvy (31 October 1898 – 30 October 1990) was a demographer, anthropologist and historian of the French economy. Sauvy coined the term Third World (&quot;Tiers Monde&quot;) in reference to countries that were unaligned with either the Western bloc or the Eastern bloc during the Cold War.

==Biography==
Sauvy was born in Villeneuve-de-la-Raho (Pyrénées-Orientales) in 1898 to a family of Catalan wine-growers, and educated at the École Polytechnique. After graduating, he worked at Statistique Générale de France until 1937. He took part in the X-Crise Group. From 1938, he was economic advisor to Minister of Finance Paul Reynaud until the Second World War broke out in 1939. He founded Institut Français de la Conjoncture in 1938.

Under the Nazi occupation, Sauvy contributed to the &quot;Bulletins rouge-brique&quot;, a government-sanctioned periodical. After the war, Charles de Gaulle offered to appoint him to the position of General Secretary for Family and Population, but Sauvy preferred to devote himself to demographics.

From 1940 to 1959, he taught at the Institut d’études politiques (IEP) and was Professor of Social Demography at the Collège de France.

He became director of INED (National Institute of Demographic Studies) and simultaneously represented France at the commission of Statistics and Population of the United Nations. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1973) and the American Philosophical Society (1974). He wrote for &quot;Le Monde&quot; until his death in October 1990.

==Key ideas==
Writing in 1949, Sauvy described potential overpopulation as a &#x27;false problem&#x27; and argued against attempts at global population control. He suggested examining countries on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they lack the raw materials and natural resources that can support a larger population. Otherwise, he thought that we run the risk of underpopulating a country that could support a much larger population

Sauvy coined the term &#x27;Third World&#x27; in an article published in the French magazine, &quot;L&#x27;Observateur&quot; on August 14, 1952. He wrote:

:&quot;...car enfin, ce Tiers Monde ignoré, exploité, méprisé comme le Tiers Etat, veut lui aussi, être quelque chose&quot;
:&quot;...because at the end, this ignored, exploited, scorned Third World, like the Third Estate, wants also, to become something&quot;.

Sauvy coined Third World by analogy with the Third Estate and the above quote is a paraphrase of Sieyès&#x27;s famous sentence about the Third Estate during the French Revolution.

<text>An Archimedean point () is a hypothetical viewpoint from which certain objective truths can perfectly be perceived (also known as a God&#x27;s-eye view) or a reliable starting point from which one may reason. In other words, a view from an Archimedean point describes the ideal of removing oneself from the object of study so that one can see it in relation to all other things while remaining independent of them.

For example, the philosopher John Rawls uses the heuristic device of the original position in an attempt to remove the particular biases of individual agents to demonstrate how rational beings might arrive at an objective formulation of justice.

== Origins ==

The term refers to the great mathematician Archimedes, who supposedly claimed that he could lift the Earth off its foundation if he were given a place to stand, one solid point, and a long enough lever.

The idea for the term is attributed to Descartes in his second &quot;Meditation&quot;, who refers to Archimedes requiring only &quot;a point that was firm and immovable,&quot; with regard to finding certainty:Archimedes, that he might transport the entire globe from the place it occupied to another, demanded only a point that was firm and immovable; so, also, I shall be entitled to entertain the highest expectations, if I am fortunate enough to discover only one thing that is certain and indubitable.

== Criticism ==
Sceptical and anti-realist philosophers criticise the possibility of an Archimedean point, claiming it is a form of scientism.

<text>Clark Byers (25 January 1915 – 17 February 2004) was an American sign maker. He is famous for painting over 900 barns in 19 states with the slogan &quot;See Rock City&quot; from 1935 to 1969.

A native of Trenton, Georgia, Byers started painting advertising on barns in the American South and Midwest for the Rock City attraction atop Lookout Mountain, Tennessee. Rock City&#x27;s owners offered barn owners a free paint job and Rock City souvenirs in exchange for allowing Byers to placing a marketing message on their barns.

Because the barns came in various shapes and sizes, each sign was different, but all featured white lettering on a black background, executed in freehand. The number of words and their arrangement varied, based on the size and shape of the barn. On larger barns, Byers might have painted &quot;See 7 States from ROCK CITY atop Lookout Mt. near Chattanooga, Tenn.&quot; and on smaller barns, just &quot;See Beautiful ROCK CITY today.&quot;

Byers&#x27; efforts led to Rock City, Lookout Mountain, and Chattanooga becoming a national tourist destination.

Two years after making her film début, in 1961, she was awarded the Prix Suzanne Bianchetti as most promising new actress in France for her performance as &quot;Amenita&quot; in the Sacha Guitry film, &quot;&quot;Stop Thief&quot;.&quot; That year she gained further recognition for her role as &quot;Constance Bonacieux&quot; in two films based on the Three Musketeers. Throughout the 1960s, she appeared in a number of films in her native France, then was contracted for Hollywood productions that included the Fred Zinnemann film &quot;Behold a Pale Horse&quot; (1964) starring luminaries Gregory Peck, Anthony Quinn, and Omar Sharif.

Secchia was a fund-raiser in the Republican Party in Michigan. He started as chairman of the Kent County, Michigan Republican Committee and later became the chairman of the 5th Congressional District of Michigan committee. He was elected to be Michigan&#x27;s Republican National Committeeman in 1980, 1984, and 1988. Secchia was a vice chairman of the Republican National Committee and headed its Midwest Region. He was host chairman of the 1985 RNC Midwest Leadership Conference in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He was on the national advisory committee of the 1988 George Bush for President Committee. Secchia founded the Lake Michigan Conference, and was a national co-chair of the Dole for President Campaign.

From 1989 to 1993 Secchia was the United States&#x27; ambassador to Italy. His nomination was controversial as he was one of several made by Bush of long-time financial backers and financial supporters, including Walter Curley (ambassador to France), Joseph Zappala (Spain), Mel Sembler (Australia), Frederic Bush Morris (Luxembourg), and Joy Silverman (Barbados).

Secchia was the CEO and chairman of the board of Universal Forest Products, a company that manufactures engineered wood components. He was Chairman of the River City Food Company which has 29 restaurants, catering facilities, and banquet locations in the states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Maryland.

In 1994 he was appointed to chair the Secchia Commission I by Michigan governor John Engler, which was focused on improving government services. The Secchia Commission II focused on public sector pensions.

He received the Cavaliere di Gran Croce (The Knight of the Great Cross). He also was awarded the Department of State Distinguished Honor Award during his service as ambassador to Italy, an award given to serving ambassadors and to non-career ambassadors.

Secchia served for twelve years on the board for John Cabot University in Rome. Secchia was a member of the National Italian American Foundation Council of 1000. He was founding president of the West Michigan Lodge of the Order of Sons of Italy in America; he inaugurated the Festa Italiana, the region&#x27;s largest annual ethnic festival and has participated in and sponsored many Italian-American events. He was awarded the NIAF Special Achievement Award for International Affairs, and lent his name to The Founding Values Initiative Award... the &quot;Secchia Award for Heartfelt Commitment.&quot;

==Philanthropy==
In 2010, Secchia made a $1 million outright donation to Michigan State University, to be used to build a new stadium for the women&#x27;s softball team at Old College Field, named Secchia Stadium.

Secchia Hall, a building on the MSU College of Human Medicine Grand Rapids campus, is named after Secchia. The building is part of the Grand Rapids Medical Mile.

Secchia Hall, a residence hall on the Grand Valley State University&#x27;s Pew Campus, is also named after Secchia.

==Death==
Secchia died on October 21, 2020, after contracting COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic in Michigan, on top of other health issues over several months.

<text>Charles Christian &quot;Sir Charles&quot; Hammer (17 May 1952 – 18 February 2004) was an American classical guitarist.

Charles Christian Hammer was born in Chicago and grew up in Riverdale, Illinois. Hammer took up the guitar in his youth after hearing The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show. He purchased his first guitar with earnings from a newspaper route. Hammer was influenced heavily by The Beatles throughout his career.

During the 1970s Hammer moved to Mexico where he studied Spanish guitar. Hammer stated that his nickname, &quot;Sir Charles&quot;, was given to him about this time by a &quot;fairy princess&quot; with golden hair, but it is more probable that the nickname arose from comments about the styling of his blond hair or the baroque puffy-sleeved shirts he wore on stage.

In the 1980s Hammer moved back to the United States, establishing himself as a local act in the small artist&#x27;s retreat of Eureka Springs, Arkansas, where he performed at weddings and parties.

During this time and into the 1990s Hammer experimented in the studio. He generated 11 albums that combined electric and classical guitar but fell short of his long established goal of producing 30 albums during his lifetime.

In the late 1990s, Hammer taught guitar and music history at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree and a master&#x27;s degree in music. In 1998 he was awarded a music composition fellowship by the Arkansas Arts Council. Hammer&#x27;s final album was a classical guitar rendering of several of his favorite Beatles songs.

Just prior to his death Hammer began to experience some commercial success in the foreign market and was scheduled to tour three cities in Mexico. Hammer was a much-loved figure in Eureka Springs, especially by the local children for whom he put on school concerts.

In 2003 he was diagnosed with lung cancer. Charles Christian Hammer died on 18 February 2004 at St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital in Rogers, Arkansas. Hammer was survived by his long-time partner, Poco Carter, and their dog Prema.

<text>The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA; Japanese: 大日本帝国陸軍, Hepburn: Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun, &quot;Army of the Greater Japanese Empire&quot;) was the principal ground force of the Empire of Japan. Forming one of the military branches of the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces (IJAF), it was controlled by the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office and the Army Ministry, both of which were nominally subordinate to the Emperor of Japan, the supreme commander of IJAF. During the 20th century, an Inspectorate General of Aviation became the third agency with oversight of the IJA. At its height, the IJA was one of the most influential factions in the politics of Japan.

==History==

===Origins (1868–1871)===
In the mid-19th century, Japan had no unified national army and the country was made up of feudal domains (&quot;han&quot;) with the Tokugawa shogunate (&quot;bakufu&quot;) in overall control, which had ruled Japan since 1603. The bakufu army, although a large force, was only one among others, and bakufu efforts to control the nation depended upon the cooperation of its vassals&#x27; armies. The opening of the country after two centuries of seclusion subsequently led to the Meiji Restoration and the Boshin War in 1868. The domains of Satsuma and Chōshū came to dominate the coalition against the shogunate.

====Boshin War====

On 27 January 1868, tensions between the shogunate and imperial sides came to a head when Tokugawa Yoshinobu marched on Kyoto, accompanied by a 15,000-strong force, some of which had been trained by French military advisers. They were opposed by 5,000 troops from the Satsuma, Chōshū, and Tosa domains. At the two road junctions of Toba and Fushimi just south of Kyoto, the two forces clashed. On the second day, an Imperial banner was given to the defending troops and a member of the Imperial Family, the Prince Ninnaji, was named nominal commander in chief, in effect making the pro-imperial forces officially an The bakufu forces eventually retreated to Osaka, with the remaining forces ordered to retreat to Edo. Yoshinobu and his closest advisors left for Edo by ship. The encounter at Toba–Fushimi between the imperial and shogunate forces marked the beginning of the conflict. With the court in Kyoto firmly behind the Satsuma-Chōshū-Tosa coalition, other domains that were sympathetic to the causesuch as Tottori (&quot;Inaba&quot;), Aki (&quot;Hiroshima&quot;), and Hizen (&quot;Saga&quot;)emerged to take a more active role in military operations. Western domains that had either supported the shogunate or remained neutral also quickly announced their support of the restoration movement.

The nascent Meiji state required a new military command for its operations against the shogunate. In 1868, the &quot;Imperial Army&quot; being just a loose amalgam of domain armies, the government created four military divisions: the Tōkaidō, Tōsandō, San&#x27;indō, and Hokurikudō, each of which was named for a major highway. Overseeing these four armies was a new high command, the Eastern Expeditionary High Command (&quot;Tōsei daisō tokufu&quot;), whose nominal head was prince Arisugawa-no-miya, with two court nobles as senior staff officers. This connected the loose assembly of domain forces with the imperial court, which was the only national institution in a still unformed nation-state. The army continually emphasized its link with the imperial court: firstly, to legitimize its cause; secondly, to brand enemies of the imperial government as enemies of the court and traitors; and, lastly, to gain popular support. To supply food, weapons, and other supplies for the campaign, the imperial government established logistical relay stations along three major highways. These small depots held stockpiled material supplied by local pro-government domains, or confiscated from the bakufu and others opposing the imperial government. Local villagers were routinely impressed as porters to move and deliver supplies between the depots and frontline units.

====Struggles to form a centralized army====
Initially, the new army fought under makeshift arrangements, with unclear channels of command and control and no reliable recruiting base. Although fighting for the imperial cause, many of the units were loyal to their domains rather than the imperial court. In March 1869, the imperial government created various administrative offices, including a military branch; and in the following month organized an imperial bodyguard of 400 to 500, which consisted of Satsuma and Chōshū troops strengthened by veterans of the encounter at Toba–Fushimi, as well as yeoman and masterless samurai from various domains. The imperial court told the domains to restrict the size of their local armies and to contribute to funding a national officers&#x27; training school in Kyoto. However, within a few months the government disbanded both the military branch and the imperial bodyguard: the former was ineffective while the latter lacked modern weaponry and equipment. To replace them, two new organizations were created. One was the military affairs directorate which was composed of two bureaus, one for the army and one for the navy. The directorate drafted an army from troop contributions from each domain proportional to each domain&#x27;s annual rice production (&quot;koku&quot;). This conscript army (&quot;chōheigun&quot;) integrated samurai and commoners from various domains into its ranks. As the war continued, the military affairs directorate expected to raise troops from the wealthier domains and, in June, the organization of the army was fixed, where each domain was required to send ten men for each 10,000 koku of rice produced. However, this policy put the imperial government in direct competition with the domains for military recruitment, which was not rectified until April 1868, when the government banned the domains from enlisting troops. Consequently, the quota system never fully worked as intended and was abolished the following year.

The Imperial forces encountered numerous difficulties during the war, especially during the campaign in Eastern Japan. Headquarters in faraway Kyoto often proposed plans at odds with the local conditions, which led to tensions with officers in the field, who in many cases ignored centralized direction in favor of unilateral action. The army lacked a strong central staff that was capable of enforcing orders. Consequently, military units were at the mercy of individual commanders&#x27; leadership and direction. This was not helped by the absence of a unified tactical doctrine, which left units to fight according to the tactics favored by their respective commanders. There was increased resentment by many lower ranked commanders as senior army positions were monopolized by the nobility together with samurai from Chōshū and Satsuma. The use of commoners within the new army created resentment among the samurai class. Although the nascent Meiji government achieved military success, the war left a residue of disgruntled warriors and marginalized commoners, together with a torn social fabric.

===Foundation of a national army (1871–1873)===

After the defeat of the Tokugawa shogunate and operations in Northeastern Honshu and Hokkaido a true national army did not exist. Many in the restoration coalition had recognized the need for a strong centralized authority and although the imperial side was victorious, the early Meiji government was weak and the leaders had to maintain their standing with their domains whose military forces was essential for whatever the government needed to achieve. The leaders of the restoration were divided over the future organization of the army. Ōmura Masujirō who had sought a strong central government at the expense of the domains advocated for the creation of a standing national army along European lines
under the control of the government, the introduction of conscription for commoners and the abolition of the samurai class. Ōkubo Toshimichi preferred a small volunteer force consisting of former samurai. Ōmura&#x27;s views for modernizing Japan&#x27;s military led to his assassination in 1869 and his ideas were largely implemented after his death by Yamagata Aritomo. Aritomo has been described as the father of the Imperial Japanese Army. Yamagata had commanded mixed commoner-samurai Chōshū units during the Boshin War and was convinced of the merit of peasant soldiers. Although he himself was part of the samurai class, albeit of insignificant lower status, Yamagata distrusted the warrior class, several members of whom he regarded as clear dangers to the Meiji state.

====Establishment of the Imperial Guard and institutional reforms====
In March 1871, the War Ministry announced the creation of an Imperial Guard (&quot;Goshinpei&quot;) of six thousand men, consisting of nine infantry battalions, two artillery batteries and two cavalry squadrons. The emperor donated 100,000 ryō to underwrite the new unit, which was subordinate to the court. It was composed of members of the Satsuma, Chōshū and Tosa domains, who had led the restoration. Satsuma provided four battalions of infantry and four artillery batteries; Chōshū provided three battalions of infantry; Tosa two battalions of infantry, two squadrons of cavalry, and two artillery batteries. For the first time, the Meiji government was able to organize a large body of soldiers under a consistent rank and pay scheme with uniforms, which were loyal to the government rather than the domains. The Imperial Guard&#x27;s principal mission was to protect the throne by suppressing domestic samurai revolts, peasant uprisings and anti-government demonstrations. The possession of this military force was a factor in the government&#x27;s abolition of the han system.

The military ministry (&quot;Hyōbushō&quot;) was reorganized in July 1871; on August 29, simultaneously with the decree abolishing the domains, the Dajōkan ordered local daimyos to disband their private armies and turn their weapons over to the government. Although the government played on the foreign threat, especially Russia&#x27;s southward expansion, to justify a national army, the immediately perceived danger was domestic insurrection. Consequently, on August 31, the country was divided into four military districts, each with its own chindai (&quot;garrison&quot;) to deal with peasant uprisings or samurai insurrections. The Imperial Guard formed the Tokyo garrison, whereas troops from the former domains filled the ranks of the Osaka, Kumamoto, and Sendai garrisons. The four garrisons had a total of about 8,000 troopsmostly infantry, but also a few hundred artillerymen and engineers. Smaller detachments of troops also guarded outposts at Kagoshima, Fushimi, Nagoya, Hiroshima, and elsewhere. By late December 1871, the army set modernization and coastal defense as priorities; long-term plans were devised for an armed force to maintain internal security, defend strategic coastal areas, train and educate military and naval officers, and build arsenals and supply depots. Despite previous rhetoric about the foreign menace, little substantive planning was directed against Russia. In February 1872, the military ministry was abolished and separate army and navy ministries were established.

====Conscription====

The conscription ordinance enacted on January 10, 1873, made universal military service compulsory for all male subjects in the country. The law called for a total of seven years of military service: three years in the regular army (&quot;jōbigun&quot;), two years in the reserve (&quot;dai&#x27;ichi kōbigun&quot;), and an additional two years in the second reserve (&quot;daini kōbigun&quot;). All able-bodied males between the ages of 17 and 40 were considered members of the national guard (&quot;kokumingun&quot;), which would only see service in a severe national crisis, such as an attack or invasion of Japan. The conscription examination decided which group of recruits would enter the army, those who failed the exam were excused from all examinations except for the national guard. Recruits who passed entered the draft lottery, where some were selected for active duty. A smaller group would be selected for replacement duty (&quot;hojū-eki&quot;) should anything happen to any of the active duty soldiers; the rest were dismissed. One of the primary differences between the samurai and the peasant class was the right to bear arms; this ancient privilege was suddenly extended to every male in the nation. There were several exemptions, including criminals, those who could show hardship, the physically unfit, heads of households or heirs, students, government bureaucrats, and teachers. A conscript could also purchase an exemption for ¥270, which was an enormous sum for the time and which restricted this privilege to the wealthy. Under the new 1873 ordinance, the conscript army was composed mainly of second and third sons of impoverished farmers who manned the regional garrisons, while former samurai controlled the Imperial Guard and the Tokyo garrison.
Initially, because of the army&#x27;s small size and numerous exemptions, relatively few young men were actually conscripted for a three-year term on active duty. In 1873, the army numbered approximately 17,900 from a population of 35 million at the time; it doubled to about 33,000 in 1875. The conscription program slowly built up the numbers. Public unrest began in 1874, reaching the apex in the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, which used the slogans, &quot;oppose conscription&quot;, &quot;oppose elementary schools&quot;, and &quot;fight Korea&quot;. It took a year for the new army to crush the uprising, but the victories proved critical in creating and stabilizing the Imperial government and to realize sweeping social, economic and political reforms that enabled Japan to become a modern state that could stand comparison to France, Germany, and other Western European powers.

===Further development and modernization (1873–1894)===
====Foreign assistance====
The early Imperial Japanese Army was developed with the assistance of advisors from France, through the second French military mission to Japan (1872–80), and the third French military mission to Japan (1884–89). However, after France&#x27;s defeat in 1871 the Japanese government switched to the victorious Germans as a model. From 1886 to April 1890, it hired German military advisors (Major Jakob Meckel, replaced in 1888 by von Wildenbrück and Captain von Blankenbourg) to assist in the training of the Japanese General Staff. In 1878, the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office, based on the German General Staff, was established directly under the Emperor and was given broad powers for military planning and strategy.

Other known foreign military consultants were Major Pompeo Grillo from the Kingdom of Italy, who worked at the Osaka foundry from 1884 to 1888, followed by Major Quaratezi from 1889 to 1890; and Captain Schermbeck from the Netherlands, who worked on improving coastal defenses from 1883 to 1886. Japan did not use foreign military advisors between 1890 and 1918, until the French military mission to Japan (1918–19), headed by Commandant Jacques-Paul Faure, was requested to assist in the development of the Japanese air services.

====Taiwan Expedition====


The Japanese invasion of Taiwan under Qing rule in 1874 was a punitive expedition by Japanese military forces in response to the Mudan Incident of December 1871. The Paiwan people, who are indigenous peoples of Taiwan, murdered 54 crewmembers of a wrecked merchant vessel from the Ryukyu Kingdom on the southwestern tip of Taiwan. 12 men were rescued by the local Chinese-speaking community and were transferred to Miyako-jima in the Ryukyu Islands. The Empire of Japan used this as an excuse to both assert sovereignty over the Ryukyu Kingdom, which was a tributary state of both Japan and Qing China at the time, and to attempt the same with Taiwan, a Qing territory. It marked the first overseas deployment of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy.

An Imperial Rescript to Soldiers and Sailors of 1882 called for unquestioning loyalty to the Emperor by the new armed forces and asserted that commands from superior officers were equivalent to commands from the Emperor himself. Thenceforth, the military existed in an intimate and privileged relationship with the imperial institution.

Top-ranking military leaders were given direct access to the Emperor and the authority to transmit his pronouncements directly to the troops. The sympathetic relationship between conscripts and officers, particularly junior officers who were drawn mostly from the peasantry, tended to draw the military closer to the people. In time, most people came to look more for guidance in national matters more to military than to political leaders.

By the 1890s, the Imperial Japanese Army had grown to become the most modern army in Asia: well-trained, well-equipped, and with good morale. However, it was basically an infantry force deficient in cavalry and artillery when compared with its European contemporaries. Artillery pieces, which were purchased from America and a variety of European nations, presented two problems: they were scarce, and the relatively small number that were available were of several different calibers, causing problems with ammunition supply.

===First Sino-Japanese War===


In the early months of 1894, the Donghak Peasant Revolution broke out in southern Korea and had soon spread throughout the rest of the country, threatening the Korea capital Seoul, itself. The Chinese, since the beginning of May had taken steps to prepare the mobilization of their forces in the provinces of Zhili, Shandong and in Manchuria, as a result of the tense situation on the Korean peninsula. These actions were planned more as an armed demonstration intended to strengthen the Chinese position in Korea, rather than as a preparation for war with Japan. On June 3, the Chinese government accepted the requests from the Korean government to send troops to help quell the rebellion, additionally they also informed the Japanese of the action. It was decided to send 2,500 men to Asan, about 70 km from the capital Seoul. The troops arrived in Asan on June 9 and were additionally reinforced by 400 more on June 25, a total of about 2,900 Chinese soldiers were at Asan.

From the very outset the developments in Korea had been carefully observed in Tokyo. Japanese government had soon become convinced that the Donghak Peasant Revolution would lead to Chinese intervention in Korea. As a result, soon after learning word about the Korean government&#x27;s request for Chinese military help, immediately ordered all warships in the vicinity to be sent to Pusan and Chemulpo. On June 9, a formation of 420 &quot;rikusentai&quot;, selected from the crews of the Japanese warships was immediately dispatched to Seoul, where they served temporarily as a counterbalance to the Chinese troops camped at Asan. Simultaneously, the Japanese decided to send a reinforced brigade of approximately 8,000 troops to Korea. The reinforced brigade, included auxiliary units, under the command of General Oshima Yoshimasa was fully transported to Korea by June 27. The Japanese stated to the Chinese that they were willing to withdraw the brigade under General Oshima if the Chinese left Asan prior. However, when on 16 July, 8,000 Chinese troops landed near the entrance of the Taedong River to reinforce Chinese troops garrisoned in Pyongyang, the Japanese delivered Li Hongzhang an ultimatum, threatening to take action if any further troops were sent to Korea. Consequently, General Oshima in Seoul and commanders of the Japanese warships in Korean waters received orders allowing them to initiate military operations if any more Chinese troops were sent to Korea. Despite this ultimatum, Li, considered that Japanese were bluffing and were trying to probe the Chinese readiness to make concessions. He decided, therefore to reinforce Chinese forces in Asan with a further 2,500 troops, 1,300 of which arrived in Asan during the night of July 23–24. At the same time, in the early morning of July 23, the Japanese had taken control of the Royal Palace in Seoul and imprisoned King Gojong, forcing him to renounce ties with China.

During the almost two-month interval prior to the declaration of war, the two service staffs developed a two-stage operational plan against China. The army&#x27;s 5th Division would land at Chemulpo to prevent a Chinese advance in Korea while the navy would engage the Beiyang fleet in a decisive battle in order to secure control of the seas. If the navy defeated the Chinese fleet decisively and secured command of the seas, the larger part of the army would undertake immediate landings on the coast between Shanhaiguan and Tianjin, and advance to the Zhili plain in order to defeat the main Chinese forces and bring the war to a swift conclusion. If neither side gained control of the sea and supremacy, the army would concentrate on the occupation of Korea and exclude Chinese influence there. Lastly, if the navy was defeated and consequently lost command of the sea, Japanese forces in Korea would be ordered to hang on and fight a rearguard action while the bulk of the army would remain in Japan in preparation to repel a Chinese invasion. This worst-case scenario also foresaw attempts to rescue the beleaguered 5th Division in Korea while simultaneously strengthening homeland defenses. The army&#x27;s contingency plans which were both offensive and defensive, depended on the outcome of the naval operations.

Clashes between Chinese and Japanese forces at Pungdo and Seongwhan caused irreversible changes to Sino-Japanese relations and meant that a state of war now existed between the two countries. The two governments officially declared war on August 1. Initially, the general staff&#x27;s objective was to secure the Korean peninsula before the arrival of winter and then land forces near Shanhaiguan. However, as the navy was unable to bring the Beiyang fleet into battle in mid-August, temporarily withdrew from the Yellow Sea to refit and replenish its ships. As a consequence, in late August the general staff ordered an advance overland to the Zhili plain via Korea in order to capture bases on the Liaodong Peninsula to prevent Chinese forces from interfering with the drive on Beijing. The First Army with two divisions was activated on September 1. In mid-September 17, the Chinese forces defeated at Pyongyang and occupied the city, as the remaining Chinese troops retreated northward. The navy&#x27;s stunning victory in the Yalu on September 17, was crucial to the Japanese as it allowed the Second Army with three divisions and one brigade to land unopposed on the Liaodong Peninsula about 100 miles north of Port Arthur which controlled the entry to the Bohai Gulf, in mid-October. While, the First Army pursued the remaining Chinese forces from Korea across the Yalu River, Second Army occupied the city of Dairen on November 8 and then seized the fortress and harbor at Port Arthur on November 25. Farther north, the First army&#x27;s offensive stalled and was beset by supply problems and winter weather.

===Boxer Rebellion===
In 1899–1900, Boxer attacks against foreigners in China intensified, resulting in the siege of the diplomatic legations in Beijing. An international force consisting of British, French, Russian, German, Italian, Austro-Hungarian, American, and Japanese troops was eventually assembled to relieve the legations. The Japanese provided the largest contingent of troops, 20,840, as well as 18 warships.

A small, hastily assembled, vanguard force of about 2,000 troops, under the command of British Admiral Edward Seymour, departed by rail, from Tianjin, for the legations in early June. On June 12, mixed Boxer and Chinese regular army forces halted the advance, some 30 miles from the capital. The road-bound and badly outnumbered allies withdrew to the vicinity of Tianjin, having suffered more than 300 casualties. The army general staff in Tokyo became aware of the worsening conditions in China and had drafted ambitious contingency plans, but the government, in light of the Triple Intervention refused to deploy large forces unless requested by the western powers. However, three days later, the general staff did dispatch a provisional force of 1,300 troops, commanded by Major General Fukushima Yasumasa, to northern China. Fukushima was chosen because his ability to speak fluent English which enabled him to communicate with the British commander. The force landed near Tianjin on July 5.

On June 17, with tensions increasing, naval &quot;Rikusentai&quot; from Japanese ships had joined British, Russian, and German sailors to seize the Dagu forts near Tianjin. Four days later, the Qing court declared war on the foreign powers. The British, in light of the precarious situation, were compelled to ask Japan for additional reinforcements, as the Japanese had the only readily available forces in the region. Britain at the time was heavily engaged in the Boer War, and, consequently, a large part of the British army was tied down in South Africa. Deploying large numbers of troops from British garrisons in India would take too much time and weaken internal security there. Overriding personal doubts, Foreign Minister Aoki Shūzō calculated that the advantages of participating in an allied coalition were too attractive to ignore. Prime Minister Yamagata likewise concurred, but others in the cabinet demanded that there be guarantees from the British in return for the risks and costs of a major deployment of Japanese troops. On July 6, the 5th Infantry Division was alerted for possible deployment to China, but without a timetable being set. Two days later, on July 8, with more ground troops urgently needed to lift the siege of the foreign legations at Beijing, the British ambassador offered the Japanese government one million British pounds in exchange for Japanese participation.

Shortly afterward, advance units of the 5th Division departed for China, bringing Japanese strength to 3,800 personnel, of the then-17,000 allied force. The commander of the 5th Division, Lt. General Yamaguchi Motoomi, had taken operational control from Fukushima. A second, stronger allied expeditionary army stormed Tianjin, on July 14, and occupied the city. The allies then consolidated and awaited the remainder of the 5th Division and other coalition reinforcements. In early August, the expedition pushed towards the capital where on August 14, it lifted the Boxer siege. By that time, the 13,000-strong Japanese force was the largest single contingent, making up about 40 percent of the approximately 33,000 strong allied expeditionary force. Japanese troops involved in the fighting had acquitted themselves well, although a British military observer felt their aggressiveness, densely packed formations, and over-willingness to attack cost them excessive casualties. For example, during the Tianjin fighting, the Japanese, while comprising less than one quarter (3,800) of the total allied force of 17,000, suffered more than half of the casualties, 400 out of 730. Similarly at Beijing, the Japanese, constituting slightly less than half of the assault force, accounted for almost two-thirds of the losses, 280 of 453.

===Russo-Japanese War===


The Russo–Japanese War (1904–1905) was the result of tensions between Russia and Japan, grown largely out of rival imperialist ambitions toward Manchuria and Korea. The Japanese army inflicted severe losses against the Russians; however, they were not able to deal a decisive blow to the Russian armies. Over-reliance on infantry led to large casualties among Japanese forces, especially during the siege of Port Arthur.

In 1902, the English, who like the Japanese after their war with China, had found themselves isolated owing to European condemnation for waging war on the Boers in South Africa, were only too happy to sign a defensive alliance with Japan. A condition of this treaty was that England would go to war with any country that joined Russia in a war against Japan. To add more weight to Japanese security, the American President, Theodore Roosevelt, gave a firm warning to France and Germany that any further bullying on their part towards Japan would result in America coming out firmly on her side.

Confronted by the proposition of having no allies, and the possibility of incurring the wrath of both America and Britain, The Tsar (Nicholas II) agreed to a staged withdrawal of his forces from Manchuria. By 1903 however this had been watered down with Russian troops still remaining ostensibly to guard their newly constructed railways, and also by the creation of the Russian Far East Timber Company which saw the potential of lucrative lumber concessions along the borders of Korea and China.

===World War I===
The Empire of Japan entered the war on the Entente side. Although tentative plans were made to send an expeditionary force of between 100,000 and 500,000 men to fight in France on the Western Front, ultimately among the few actions in which the Imperial Japanese Army was involved was the careful and well executed attack on the German concession of Qingdao in 1914 and the seizure of various other small German islands and colonies.

===Inter-war years===
====Siberian intervention====


During 1917–18, Japan continued to extend its influence and privileges in China via the Nishihara Loans.
During the Siberian Intervention, following the collapse of the Russian Empire after the Bolshevik Revolution, the Imperial Japanese Army initially planned to send more than 70,000 troops to occupy Siberia as far west as Lake Baikal. The army general staff came to view the Tsarist collapse as an opportunity to free Japan from any future threat from Russia by detaching Siberia and forming an independent buffer state. The plan was scaled back considerably due to opposition from the United States.

In July 1918, the U.S. President, Woodrow Wilson, asked the Japanese government to supply 7,000 troops as part of an international coalition of 24,000 troops to support the American Expeditionary Force Siberia. After a heated debate in the Diet, the government of Prime Minister Terauchi Masatake agreed to send 12,000 troops, but under the command of Japan, rather than as part of an international coalition. Japan and the United States sent forces to Siberia to bolster the armies of the White movement leader Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak against the Bolshevik Red Army.

Once the political decision had been reached, the Imperial Japanese Army took over full control under Chief of Staff General Yui Mitsue; and by November 1918, more than 70,000 Japanese troops had occupied all ports and major towns in the Russian Maritime Provinces and eastern Siberia.

In June 1920, the United States and its allied coalition partners withdrew from Vladivostok, after the capture and execution of the White Army leader, Admiral Kolchak, by the Red Army. However, the Japanese decided to stay, primarily due to fears of the spread of communism so close to Japan and Japanese-controlled Korea. The Japanese Army provided military support to the Japanese-backed Provisional Priamurye Government, based in Vladivostok, against the Moscow-backed Far Eastern Republic.

The continued Japanese presence concerned the United States, which suspected that Japan had territorial designs on Siberia and the Russian Far East. Subjected to intense diplomatic pressure by the United States and Great Britain, and facing increasing domestic opposition due to the economic and human cost, the administration of Prime Minister Katō Tomosaburō withdrew the Japanese forces in October 1922.

====Rise of militarism====

In the 1920s the Imperial Japanese Army expanded rapidly and by 1927 had a force of 300,000 men. Unlike western countries, the Army enjoyed a great deal of independence from government. Under the provisions of the Meiji Constitution, the War Minister was held accountable only to the Emperor (Hirohito) himself, and not to the elected civilian government. In fact, Japanese civilian administrations needed the support of the Army in order to survive. The Army controlled the appointment of the War Minister, and in 1936 a law was passed that stipulated that only an active duty general or lieutenant-general could hold the post. As a result, military spending as a proportion of the national budget rose disproportionately in the 1920s and 1930s, and various factions within the military exerted disproportionate influence on Japanese foreign policy.

The Imperial Japanese Army was originally known simply as the Army (&quot;rikugun&quot;) but after 1928, as part of the Army&#x27;s turn toward romantic nationalism and also in the service of its political ambitions, it re-titled itself the Imperial Army (&quot;kōgun&quot;).

In 1923, the army consisted of 21 divisions, but in accordance with the 1924 reform it was reduced to 17 divisions. Two leaps in the development of the military industry (1906–1910 and 1931–1934) made it possible to re-equip the armed forces.

===Second Sino-Japanese War===
In 1931, the Imperial Japanese Army had an overall strength of 198,880 officers and men, organized into 17 divisions.
The Manchurian incident, as it became known in Japan, was a pretended sabotage of a local Japanese-owned railway, an attack staged by Japan but blamed on Chinese dissidents. Action by the military, largely independent of the civilian leadership, led to the invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and, later, to the Second Sino-Japanese War, in 1937. As war approached, the Imperial Army&#x27;s influence with the Emperor waned and the influence of the Imperial Japanese Navy increased. Nevertheless, by 1938 the Army had been expanded to 34 divisions.

===Conflict with the Soviet Union===
From 1932 to 1945 the Empire of Japan and the Soviet Union had a series of conflicts. Japan had set its military sights on Soviet territory as a result of the &quot;Hokushin-ron&quot; doctrine, and the Japanese establishment of a puppet state in Manchuria brought the two countries into conflict. The war lasted on and off with the last battles of the 1930s (the Battle of Lake Khasan and the Battles of Khalkhin Gol) ending in a decisive victory for the Soviets. The conflicts stopped with the signing of the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact on April 13, 1941. However, later, at the Yalta Conference, Stalin agreed to declare war on Japan; and on August 5, 1945, the Soviet Union voided their neutrality agreement with Japan.

===World War II===

In 1941, the Imperial Japanese Army had 51 divisions and various special-purpose artillery, cavalry, anti-aircraft, and armored units with a total of 1,700,000 people. At the beginning of the Second World War, most of the Japanese Army (27 divisions) was stationed in China. A further 13 divisions defended the Mongolian border, due to concerns about a possible attack by the Soviet Union. From 1942, soldiers were sent to Hong Kong (23rd Army), the Philippines (14th Army), Thailand (15th Army), Burma (15th Army), Dutch East Indies (16th Army), and Malaya (25th Army). By 1945, there were 6 million soldiers in the Imperial Japanese Army.

From 1943, Japanese troops suffered from a shortage of supplies, especially food, medicine, munitions, and armaments, largely due to submarine interdiction of supplies, and losses to Japanese shipping, which was worsened by a longstanding rivalry with the Imperial Japanese Navy. The lack of supplies caused large numbers of fighter aircraft to become unserviceable for lack of spare parts, and &quot;as many as two-thirds of Japan&#x27;s total military deaths [to result] from illness or starvation&quot;.

==== Salary ====
Compared to respective armies in Europe or America, soldiers in the Imperial Japanese Army received a rather meagre salary; however, the cost of living in Japan was also cheaper than in most Western nations. The below table gives figures from December 1941, when one Japanese yen was worth approximately $0.23.
For comparison, in 1942, an American private was paid approximately $50 per month (or 204 yen), meaning the lowest ranking soldier in the United States military was earning equivalent to the maximum salary of an Imperial Japanese major, or the base salary of an Imperial Japanese lieutenant colonel, and about 25 times as much as an Imperial Japanese soldier of the same rank. While disproportionate salary ranges were not uncommon between militaries during World War II, for example Australian enlistees could expect to receive roughly triple as much in pay as their counterparts fighting for the United Kingdom, by any standards, despite being widely considered a &quot;first rate&quot; or professional fighting force, men serving in the IJA were very poorly compensated.

Complicating matters further was that, by 1942, most Japanese soldiers were paid using the Japanese military yen (JMY), an unsupported currency that could not be redeemed for the regular Japanese yen. In territories under Japanese occupation, the military yenor &quot;Japanese invasion money&quot;, as it came to be known by the localswas the only legal tender in circulation. The Japanese authorities seized or ordered surrendered all other bank notes in territories under their occupation and provided compensation at an &quot;exchange rate&quot; as they saw fit, in the form of JMYs. This had the effect of affording Japanese soldiers in many occupied territories a higher degree of return for their low pay than they otherwise would have received. However, at the end of the war, the Imperial Japanese ministry of finance cancelled all military bank notes, rendering the military yen worthless.

====War crimes====

Throughout the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II, the Imperial Japanese Army had shown immense brutality and engaged in numerous atrocities against civilians, as well as prisoners of war – with the Nanjing Massacre being the most well known example. Other war crimes committed by the Imperial Japanese Army included rape and forced prostitution, death marches, using biological warfare against civilians, and the execution of prisoners of war. Such atrocities throughout the war caused tens of millions of deaths.

===Post-World War II===
====Ground Self-Defense Force====

Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution renounced the right to use force as a means of resolving disputes. This was enacted by the Japanese in order to prevent militarism, which had led to conflict. However, in 1947 the Public Security Force was formed; later in 1954, in the early stages of the Cold War, the Public Security Force formed the basis of the newly created Ground Self-Defense Force. Although significantly smaller than the former Imperial Japanese Army and nominally for defensive purposes only, this force constitutes the modern army of Japan.

====Continued resistance====

Separately, some soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army continued to fight on isolated Pacific islands until at least the 1970s, with the last known Japanese soldier surrendering in 1974. Intelligence officer Hiroo Onoda, who surrendered on Lubang Island in the Philippines in March 1974, and Teruo Nakamura, who surrendered on the Indonesian island of Morotai in December 1974, appear to have been the last holdouts but there are reports of other Japanese holdout later then December 1974.

<text>The Prix Suzanne Bianchetti is an award in French cinema given annually since 1937 to the most promising young film actress.

The award was created by writer and actor René Jeanne (1887–1969) who served as the director of &quot;L&#x27;Etablissement Cinématographique des Armées&quot;. When his wife, the actress Suzanne Bianchetti, died in 1936 at the age of 47, he established an award dedicated to her memory to be given annually to the most promising young actress.

The award was given for the first time in 1937 to actress Junie Astor for her performance in the film &quot;Women&#x27;s Club&quot;. The award comes in the form of a medallion engraved with Suzanne Bianchetti&#x27;s image. Since its inception, the Prix Suzanne Bianchetti has been awarded to many of the greatest names in French cinema who went on to national and international stardom.

<text>Anne Elizabeth Applebaum (born July 25, 1964) is an American journalist and historian. She has written about the history of Communism and the development of civil society in Central and Eastern Europe. Applebaum also holds Polish citizenship.

She has worked at &quot;The Economist&quot; and &quot;The Spectator&quot;, and was a member of the editorial board of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; (2002–2006). Applebaum won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 2004 for &quot;&quot; published the previous year. She is a staff writer for &quot;The Atlantic&quot; and a senior fellow at The Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.

==Early life and education==
Applebaum was born in Washington, D.C. to a reform Jewish family, the eldest of three daughters of Harvey M. and Elizabeth Applebaum. Her father, a Yale alumnus, is senior counsel at Covington &amp; Burling&#x27;s Antitrust and International Trade Practices. Her mother was a program coordinator at the Corcoran Gallery of Art. According to Applebaum, her great-grandparents immigrated to North America during the reign of Alexander III of Russia from what is now Belarus.

After attending Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C., Applebaum entered Yale University, where during the Fall 1982 semester she studied Soviet history under Wolfgang Leonhard. As an undergraduate, she spent the summer of 1985 in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia), an experience she credits with helping shape her opinions.

Applebaum received her BA from Yale in 1986 &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in history and literature, and was the recipient of a two-year Marshall Scholarship at the London School of Economics, where she earned a master&#x27;s degree in international relations (1987). She also studied at St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford, before becoming a correspondent for &quot;The Economist&quot; and moving to Warsaw, Poland, in 1988.

In November 1989, Applebaum drove from Warsaw to Berlin to report on the collapse of the Berlin Wall.

== Career ==
As foreign correspondent for &quot;The Economist&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot;, she covered the fall of the Berlin Wall and the fall of communism. In 1991 she moved back to England to work for &quot;The Economist&quot;, and was later hired as the foreign and later deputy editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot;, and later the political editor of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;.

In 1994, she published her first book &quot;Between East and West: Across the Borderlands of Europe&quot;, a travelogue that described the rise of nationalism across the new states of the former Soviet Union. In 2001, she interviewed prime minister Tony Blair. She also undertook historical research for her book &quot;&quot; (2003) on the Soviet prison camp system, which won the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction. It was also nominated for a National Book Award, for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; book award and for the National Book Critics Circle Award.

She has been a member of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; editorial board. She was a columnist at &quot;The Washington Post&quot; for seventeen years. Applebaum was an adjunct fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.

Her second history book, &quot;Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe 1944–56&quot;, was published in 2012 by Doubleday in the US and Allen Lane in the UK; it was nominated for a National Book Award, shortlisted for the 2013 PEN/John Kenneth Galbraith Award.

From 2011 to 2016, she created and ran the Transitions Forum at the Legatum Institute, an international think tank and educational charity based in London. Among other projects, she ran a two-year program examining the relationship between democracy and growth in Brazil, India and South Africa, created the Future of Syria and Future of Iran projects on future institutional change in those two countries, and commissioned a series of papers on corruption in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine.

Together with &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine she created Democracy Lab, a website focusing on countries in transition to, or away from, democracy and which has since become Democracy Post at &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. She also ran Beyond Propaganda, a program examining 21st century propaganda and disinformation. Started in 2014, the program anticipated later debates about &quot;fake news&quot;. In 2016, she left Legatum because of its stance on Brexit following the appointment of Euroskeptic Philippa Stroud as CEO and joined the London School of Economics as a Professor of Practice at the Institute for Global Affairs. At the LSE, she ran Arena, a program on disinformation and 21st century propaganda. In the autumn of 2019 she moved the project to the Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University.

In October 2017, she published her third history book, &quot;Red Famine: Stalin&#x27;s War on Ukraine,&quot; a history of the Holodomor. The book won the Lionel Gelber Prize and the Duff Cooper Prize, making her the only author to ever win the Duff Cooper Prize twice.

In November 2019, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; announced that Applebaum was joining the publication as a staff writer starting in January 2020. She was included in the 2020 &quot;Prospect&quot; list of the top-50 thinkers for the COVID-19 era.

In July 2020, &quot;Twilight of Democracy: The Seductive Lure of Authoritarianism&quot; was published. Partly a memoir and partly political analysis, it was a &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; and &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller.

Also in July 2020, Applebaum was one of the 153 signers of the &quot;Harper&#x27;s Letter&quot; (also known as &quot;A Letter on Justice and Open Debate&quot;) that expressed concern that &quot;the free exchange of information and ideas, the lifeblood of a liberal society, is daily becoming more constricted.&quot;

In November 2022, Applebaum was one of 200 US citizens sanctioned by Russia for &quot;promotion of the Russophobic campaign and support for the regime in Kiev.&quot;

Applebaum is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. She is on the board of the National Endowment for Democracy and Renew Democracy Initiative. She was a member of the Institute for War and Peace Reporting&#x27;s international board of directors. She was a Senior Adjunct Fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) where she co-led a major initiative aimed at countering Russian disinformation in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). She was on the editorial board for &quot;The American Interest&quot; and the &quot;Journal of Democracy&quot;.

== Positions ==
=== Soviet Union and Russia ===

According to Sheila Fitzpatrick, &quot;Applebaum has been active as a political commentator highly critical of Russia and Putin’s regime.&quot; Ivan Krastev asserts that the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall &quot;was the point of departure of everything that Applebaum did in the following three decades...For her, the end of the Cold War was not a geopolitical story; it was a moral story, a verdict pronounced by history itself.&quot; 

Applebaum has been writing about the Soviet Union and Russia since the early 1990s. In 2000, she described the links between the then-new president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, with the former Soviet leader Yuri Andropov and the former KGB. In 2008, she began speaking about &quot;Putinism&quot; as an anti-democratic ideology, though most at the time still considered the Russian president to be a pro-Western pragmatist.

Applebaum has been a vocal critic of Western conduct regarding the Russian military intervention in Ukraine. In an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on March 5, 2014, she maintained that the US and its allies should not continue to enable &quot;the existence of a corrupt Russian regime that is destabilizing Europe&quot;, noting that the actions of President Vladimir Putin had violated &quot;a series of international treaties&quot;. On March 7, in another article on &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, discussing an information war, Applebaum argued that &quot;a robust campaign to tell the truth about Crimea is needed to counter Moscow&#x27;s lies&quot;. At the end of August, she asked whether Ukraine should prepare for &quot;total war&quot; with Russia and whether central Europeans should join them.

In 2014, writing in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; she asked (in a review of Karen Dawisha&#x27;s &quot;Putin&#x27;s Kleptocracy&quot;) whether &quot;the most important story of the past twenty years might not, in fact, have been the failure of democracy, but the rise of a new form of Russian authoritarianism&quot;. She has described the &quot;myth of Russian humiliation&quot; and argued that NATO and EU expansion have been a &quot;phenomenal success&quot;. In July 2016, before the US election, she wrote about connections between Donald Trump and Russia and wrote that Russian support for Trump was part of a wider Russian political campaign designed to destabilize the West. In December 2019, she wrote in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; that &quot;in the 21st century, we must also contend with a new phenomenon: right-wing intellectuals, now deeply critical of their own societies, who have begun paying court to right-wing dictators who dislike America.&quot;

=== Central Europe ===

Applebaum has written about the history of central and eastern Europe, Poland in particular. In the conclusion to her book &quot;Iron Curtain&quot;, Applebaum argued that the reconstruction of civil society was the most important and most difficult challenge for the post-communist states of central Europe; in another essay, she argued that the modern authoritarian obsession with civil society repression dates back to Vladimir Lenin. She has written essays on the Polish film-maker Andrzej Wajda, on the dual Nazi–Soviet occupation of central Europe, and on why it is inaccurate to define &quot;Eastern Europe&quot; as a single entity.

=== Disinformation, propaganda and fake news ===

In 2014, Applebaum and Peter Pomerantsev launched Beyond Propaganda, a program examining disinformation and propaganda, at the Legatum Institute. Applebaum wrote about a 2014 Russian smear campaign aimed at her when she was writing heavily about the Russian annexation of Crimea. She stated that dubious material posted on the web was eventually recycled by semi-respectable American pro-Russian websites. Applebaum argued in 2015 that Facebook should take responsibility for spreading false stories and help &quot;undo the terrible damage done by Facebook and other forms of social media to democratic debate and civilized discussion all over the world&quot;. Applebaum has been a member of the advisory panel of the Global Disinformation Index.

=== Nationalism ===

In March 2016, eight months before the election of President Donald Trump, Applebaum wrote a &quot;Washington Post&quot; column asking, &quot;Is this the end of the West as we know it?&quot;, which argued that &quot;we are two or three bad elections away from the end of NATO, the end of the European Union and maybe the end of the liberal world order&quot;. Applebaum endorsed Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign for president in July 2016 on the grounds that Trump is &quot;a man who appears bent on destroying the alliances that preserve international peace and American power&quot;.

Applebaum&#x27;s March 2016 &quot;Washington Post&quot; column prompted the Swiss newspaper &quot;Tages-Anzeiger&quot; and the German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; to interview her. The articles appeared in December 2016 and January 2017. She argued very early on that the international populist movement which had frequently been identified as &quot;far right&quot; or &quot;alt right&quot; were in truth not conservative in nature in a way that the term &quot;conservative&quot; had long been defined. She wrote that populist groups in Europe share &quot;ideas and ideology, friends and founders&quot;, and that, unlike Burkean conservatives, they seek to &quot;overthrow the institutions of the present to bring back things that existed in the past—or that they believe existed in the past—by force.&quot; Applebaum has underlined the danger of a new &quot;Nationalist International&quot;, a union of xenophobic, nationalist parties such as Law and Justice in Poland, the Northern League in Italy, and the Freedom Party in Austria.

In January 2022, Applebaum was invited to testify before the US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee hearing entitled &quot;Bolstering Democracy in the Age of Rising Authoritarianism&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1992, Applebaum married Radosław Sikorski, who later served as Poland&#x27;s Defence Minister, Foreign Minister, Marshal of the Sejm, and a member of the European Parliament. Since 2023, he has again been Minister of Foreign Affairs. The couple have two sons, Aleksander and Tadeusz. She became a Polish citizen in 2013. She speaks Polish and Russian in addition to English.

<text>Antonio de la Rúa Pertiné (born 7 March 1974) is an Argentine lawyer, and the son of former president Fernando de la Rúa (who governed Argentina from 1999 to 2001) and Inés Pertiné. He was an advisor to his father during his father&#x27;s presidency and one of the heads of his father&#x27;s presidential campaign. He is Shakira&#x27;s ex-boyfriend.

== Politics ==
Though de la Rúa held no formal position in his father&#x27;s government, he was the chief architect of his father&#x27;s election campaign; his success led his father to continue to turn to him for political advice after his assumption of the presidency. He was pointed to as the leader of the &quot;Sushi set&quot; (&quot;El grupo sushi&quot;), a group of young officials so-called due to their alleged preference for expensive Japanese cuisine; they were sometimes criticised for their influence on politics. After the collapse of the de la Rúa presidency, de la Rúa focused his energies on philanthropy and distanced himself from politics, thus marking the end of the influence of the &quot;Sushi Group&quot;.

== Personal life ==
De la Rúa was a target of paparazzi coverage after his father became president. In 1999, he started dating the Colombian singer Shakira. On 10 January 2011, Shakira announced on her website that after 11 years together, she and de la Rúa had separated in August 2010 after making &quot;a mutual decision to take time apart from [their] romantic relationship.&quot; She wrote that the couple &quot;view this period of separation as temporary and as a time of individual growth as [they] continue to be partners in [their] business and professional lives&quot;, with de la Rúa overseeing Shakira&#x27;s &quot;business and career interests as he has always done.&quot; In September 2012, he filed a lawsuit for $250 million against Shakira. His lawsuit was dismissed by a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge in August 2013.

== ALAS ==
In December 2006, de la Rúa, together with a group of prominent Latin American businessmen and artists, founded ALAS Foundation. Foundation ALAS is a non-profit organization that promotes Early Childhood Development in Hispanic America.

Foundation ALAS had Nobel Prize winner Gabriel García Márquez as its Honorary President. Its founding members include de la Rúa, Carlos Slim, and Alejandro Bulgheroni among others. 

On 22 February 2010, Antonio de la Rúa and Shakira were invited to the White House where they discussed with President Barack Obama the importance of investing in Early Childhood Development Policies.

<text>The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth, commonly referred to as the Jefferson Bible, is one of two religious works constructed by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson compiled the manuscripts but never published them. The first, The Philosophy of Jesus of Nazareth, was completed in 1804, but no copies exist today. The second, &quot;The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth&quot;, was completed in 1820 by cutting and pasting, with a razor and glue, numerous sections from the New Testament as extractions of the doctrine of Jesus. Jefferson&#x27;s condensed composition excludes all miracles by Jesus and most mentions of the supernatural, including sections of the four gospels that contain the Resurrection and most other miracles, and passages that portray Jesus as divine.

== Early draft ==
In an 1803 letter to Joseph Priestley, Jefferson stated that he conceived the idea of writing his view of the &quot;Christian System&quot; in a conversation with Benjamin Rush during 1798–99. He proposes beginning with a review of the morals of the ancient philosophers, moving on to the &quot;deism and ethics of the Jews&quot;, and concluding with the &quot;principles of a pure deism&quot; taught by Jesus, &quot;omitting the question of his deity&quot;. Jefferson explains that he does not have the time, and urges the task on Priestley as the person best equipped to accomplish it.

Jefferson accomplished a more limited goal in 1804 with &quot;The Philosophy of Jesus of Nazareth&quot;, the predecessor to &quot;The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth&quot;. He described it in a letter to John Adams dated October 12, 1813:

Jefferson wrote that &quot;The doctrines which flowed from the lips of Jesus Himself are within the comprehension of a child&quot;. He explained these doctrines were such as were &quot;professed &amp; acted on by the unlettered apostles, the Apostolic fathers, and the Christians of the 1st century&quot;. In a letter to Reverend Charles Clay, he described his results:

Jefferson never referred to his work as a Bible, and the full title of this 1804 version was &quot;The Philosophy of Jesus of Nazareth, being Extracted from the Account of His Life and Doctrines Given by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John; Being an Abridgement of the New Testament for the Use of the Indians, Unembarrased [uncomplicated] with Matters of Fact or Faith beyond the Level of their Comprehensions.&quot;

Jefferson frequently expressed discontent with this earlier version, which was merely a compilation of the moral teachings of Jesus. &quot;The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth&quot; represents the fulfillment of his desire to produce a more carefully assembled edition which includes what, in his estimation, can be known of the life of Jesus, whose deeds were the embodiment of his teachings.

== Content ==

Using a razor and glue, Jefferson cut and pasted his arrangement of selected verses from a 1794 bilingual Latin/Greek version using the text of the Plantin Polyglot, a French Geneva Bible and the King James Version of the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John in chronological order—putting together excerpts from one text with those of another to create a single narrative. Thus he begins with Luke 2 and Luke 3, then follows with Mark 1 and Matthew 3. He provides a record of which verses he selected, and of the order he chose in his &quot;Table of the Texts from the Evangelists employed in this Narrative and of the order of their arrangement&quot;.

Consistent with his naturalistic outlook and intent, most supernatural events are not included in Jefferson&#x27;s heavily edited compilation. Paul K. Conkin states that &quot;For the teachings of Jesus he concentrated on his milder admonitions (the Sermon on the Mount) and his most memorable parables. What resulted is a reasonably coherent, but at places oddly truncated, biography. If necessary to exclude the miraculous, Jefferson would cut the text even in mid-verse.&quot; Historian Edwin Scott Gaustad explains, &quot;If a moral lesson was embedded in a miracle, the lesson survived in Jeffersonian scripture, but the miracle did not. Even when this took some rather careful cutting with scissors or razor, Jefferson managed to maintain Jesus&#x27; role as a great moral teacher, not as a shaman or faith healer.&quot;

Therefore, &quot;The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth&quot; begins with an account of Jesus&#x27; birth without references to angels (at that time), genealogy, or prophecy. Miracles, references to the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus, and Jesus&#x27; resurrection are also absent from his collection.

The work ends with the words: &quot;Now, in the place where He was crucified, there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. There laid they Jesus. And rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.&quot; These words correspond to the ending of John 19 in the Bible.

== Purpose ==

Commenting on how Jefferson&#x27;s interest in Jesus and the Bible changed over time, Mark Holowchak writes that &quot;[t]here is what might be called his &quot;literary-criticism phase&quot; of his salad years and his &quot;naturalized-religion phase&quot; of his later, more mature years. In his literary-criticism phase, Jefferson&#x27;s interest in the Bible is critical... The Bible is a significant work of literature that is taken literally by millions, in spite of numerous hyperboles and absurdities. Thus, it is as good a book as any, and much better than most, on which to hone one&#x27;s critical skills.&quot; Here Jefferson follows the lead of Lord Bolingbroke whose religious views Jefferson commonplaced abundantly earlier in life in his Literary Commonplace Book.

In a letter to Bishop James Madison (31 Jan. 1800), cousin to the politician and future president of the same name, Jefferson expresses keen interest in Jesus as philosopher. He writes of the beliefs of German philosopher and founder of Illuminism, Adam Weishaupt. &quot;Wishaupt [&quot;sic&quot;] ...is among those (as you know the excellent Price and Priestly [&quot;sic&quot;] also are) who believe in the indefinite perfectibility of man. he thinks he may in time be rendered so perfect that he will be able to govern himself in every circumstance so as to injure none, to do all the good he can, to leave government no occasion to exercise their powers over him, &amp; of course to render political government useless. ...Wishaupt believes that to promote this perfection of the human character was the object of Jesus Christ. that his intention was simply to reinstate natural religion, &amp; by diffusing the light of his morality, to teach us to govern ourselves. his precepts are the love of god &amp; love of our neighbor. and by teaching innocence of conduct, he expected to place men in their natural state of liberty &amp; equality. he says, no one ever laid a surer foundation for liberty than our grand master, Jesus of Nazareth.&quot;
As president, he expresses those sentiments in a letter to Robinson over a year later (23 Mar. 1801). &quot;The Christian religion, when divested of the rags in which they have enveloped it, and brought to the original purity and simplicity of its benevolent institutor, is a religion of all others most friendly to liberty, science, and the freest expansion of the human mind.&quot; The letters intimate great appreciation of the life and words of Jesus as the true cynosure of republican government.

It is understood by some historians that Jefferson composed it for his own satisfaction, supporting the Christian faith as he saw it. Gaustad states, &quot;The retired President did not produce his small book to shock or offend a somnolent world; he composed it for himself, for his devotion, for his assurance, for a more restful sleep at nights and a more confident greeting of the mornings.&quot;

There is no record of this or its successor being for &quot;the Use of the Indians&quot;, despite the stated intent of the 1804 version being that purpose. Although the government long supported Christian activity among Indians, and in &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot; Jefferson supported &quot;a perpetual mission among the Indian tribes&quot;, at least in the interest of anthropology, and as President sanctioned financial support for a priest and church for the Kaskaskia Indians, Jefferson did not make these works public. Instead, he acknowledged the existence of &quot;The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth&quot; to only a few friends, saying that he read it before retiring at night, as he found this project intensely personal and private.

Ainsworth Rand Spofford, Librarian of Congress (1864–1894) stated: &quot;His original idea was to have the life and teachings of the Saviour, told in similar excerpts, prepared for the Indians, thinking this simple form would suit them best. But, abandoning this, the formal execution of his plan took the shape above described, which was for his individual use. He used the four languages that he might have the texts in them side by side, convenient for comparison. In the book he pasted a map of the ancient world and the Holy Land, with which he studied the New Testament.&quot;

Some speculate that the reference to &quot;Indians&quot; in the 1804 title may have been an allusion to Jefferson&#x27;s Federalist opponents, as he likewise used this indirect tactic against them at least once before, that being in his second inaugural address, or that he was providing himself a cover story in case this work became public.
Also referring to the 1804 version, Jefferson wrote, &quot;A more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics I have never seen; it is a document in proof that I am a real Christian, that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus.&quot;

Jefferson&#x27;s claim to be a Christian was made in response to those who accused him of being otherwise, due to his unorthodox view of the Bible and conception of Christ. Recognizing his rather unusual views, Jefferson stated in a letter (1819) to Ezra Stiles Ely, &quot;You say you are a Calvinist. I am not. I am of a sect by myself, as far as I know.&quot;

== Publication history ==
After completion of the &quot;Life and Morals&quot;, about 1820, Jefferson shared it with a number of friends, but he never allowed it to be published during his lifetime.

The most complete form Jefferson produced was inherited by his grandson, Thomas Jefferson Randolph, and was acquired in 1895 by the National Museum in Washington. The book was later published as a lithographic reproduction by an act of the United States Congress in 1904. Beginning in 1904 and continuing every other year until the 1950s, new members of Congress were given a copy of the &quot;Jefferson Bible&quot;. Until the practice first stopped, copies were provided by the Government Printing Office. A private organization, the Libertarian Press, revived the practice in 1997.

In January 2013, the American Humanist Association published an edition of the &quot;Jefferson Bible&quot;, distributing a free copy to every member of Congress and President Barack Obama. &quot;A Jefferson Bible For the Twenty-First Century&quot; adds samples of passages that Jefferson chose to omit, as well as examples of the &quot;best&quot; and &quot;worst&quot; from the Hebrew Bible, the Quran, the Bhagavad Gita, the Buddhist Sūtras, and the Book of Mormon.

The Smithsonian published the first full-color facsimile of the &quot;Jefferson Bible&quot; on November 1, 2011. Released in tandem with a &quot;Jefferson Bible&quot; exhibit at the National Museum of American History, the reproduction features introductory essays by Smithsonian Political History curators Harry R. Rubenstein and Barbara Clark Smith, and Smithsonian Senior Paper Conservator Janice Stagnitto Ellis. The book&#x27;s pages were digitized using a Hasselblad H4D50-50 megapixel DSLR camera and a Zeiss 120 macro lens, and were photographed by Smithsonian photographer, Hugh Talman.

The entire &quot;Jefferson Bible&quot; is available to view, page-by-page, on the Smithsonian National Museum of American History&#x27;s website. The high-resolution digitization enables the public to see the minute details and anomalies of each page.

The text is in the public domain and is thus freely available on the Internet.

==Recent history==
In 1895, the Smithsonian Institution under the leadership of librarian Cyrus Adler purchased the original &quot;Jefferson Bible&quot; from Jefferson&#x27;s great-granddaughter Carolina Randolph for $400. A conservation effort commencing in 2009, led by Senior Paper Conservator Janice Stagnitto Ellis, in partnership with the museum&#x27;s Political History department, allowed for a public unveiling in an exhibit open from November 11, 2011, through May 28, 2012, at the National Museum of American History. Also displayed were the source books from which Jefferson cut his selected passages, and the 1904 edition of the Jefferson Bible requested and distributed by the United States Congress. The exhibit was accompanied by an interactive digital facsimile available on the museum&#x27;s public website. On February 20, 2012, the Smithsonian Channel premiered the documentary &quot;Jefferson&#x27;s Secret Bible&quot;.

<text>The Arkansas RiverBlades were a professional ice hockey team located in North Little Rock, Arkansas. The RiverBlades were an expansion franchise that entered the East Coast Hockey League for the 1999–2000 season. Their home games were played at the newly opened Alltel Arena.

The team logo was unveiled in February 1998 and the Canadian brothers Dave Berryman and Tim Berryman were granted a lease for Alltel Arena in March. The ECHL franchise was granted in May 1998. The team was originally named the &quot;Arkansas RazorBlades&quot; and adopted a razorback hog as its mascot. The University of Arkansas objected to the name and symbology and pressed the team to finally agree to a name change. In October 1998, a contest was held to establish a new name and &quot;RiverBlades&quot; was chosen. In May 1999, the team selected the slogan &quot;Greatest Game on Ice&quot;. Little Rock&#x27;s minor league baseball team, the Arkansas Travelers, objected to the slogan which is similar to their long standing &quot;Greatest Game on Dirt&quot; slogan.

The RiverBlades played their home opener on October 28, 1999, after moving the date due to construction delays at Alltel Arena. The RiverBlades competed with the cross-town Arkansas GlacierCats who were in their second season. The two teams played on the same nights in many cases and each developed their own fan following. The next year, the GlacierCats folded after only two seasons of play, unable to compete with the RiverBlades and their new arena.

In October 2001, the ECHL approved the sale of Dave Berryman&#x27;s 51 percent stake of the team to Equity Broadcasting, which also owned the Arkansas Twisters arena football team. During the 2000–01 season, the team hosted the ECHL All-Star game at Alltel Arena.

In the summer of 2002, the Fayetteville Force, a Central Hockey League team out of North Carolina offered to switch franchises with Berryman who turned the offer down.

In early 2003, rumors began to circulate that the RiverBlades would not return for the 2003–04 season, but the company denied the rumors. In June 2003, Equity Broadcasting ended the lease with Alltel Arena and announced that it would attempt to sell the team.

In 2008, rumors began to circulate about a new season in 2010–11, however these rumors could neither be confirmed nor denied. Additionally, with the December 8, 2008, filing of chapter 11 bankruptcy by Equity Media Holdings Corporation, this became unlikely.

==Playoffs==

<text>The Arkansas GlacierCats were a short-lived minor-league hockey team located in Little Rock, Arkansas.

The Arkansas GlacierCats were a Western Professional Hockey League (WPHL) franchise in Little Rock, Arkansas. The team was owned by Ed Novess and Dan Hart of Austin, Texas and they played in the WPHL during the 1998–99 and 1999–2000 seasons. Home games were played at the old Barton Coliseum.

The GlacierCats were popular in their first year but were forced to suspend operations permanently in April 2000 largely due to competition by the Arkansas RiverBlades of the East Coast Hockey League who played at the newly opened ALLTEL Arena in North Little Rock, directly across the Arkansas River from downtown Little Rock.

<text>William Earl Bergey (February 9, 1945 – December 25, 2024) was an American professional football linebacker who played for 12 seasons in the National Football League (NFL), most notably with the Philadelphia Eagles. He played college football for the Arkansas State Red Wolves. He was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals of the American Football League (AFL) in the 1969 NFL/AFL draft, the year before the AFL–NFL merger was completed and continued to play with the Bengals in the NFL until 1973. Bergey then signed with the Eagles the following year, where he played seven seasons until retiring in 1981.

During his career, Bergey was named to five Pro Bowls, was a two-time first-team All-Pro and made one Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XV, his final professional game. He is an inductee of the Eagles Hall of Fame and the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame.

==Early life and education==
Bergey was born in South Dayton, New York, on February 9, 1945. He graduated from Pine Valley Central High School in South Dayton in 1964, and graduated from Arkansas State University (ASU), where he played under coach Bernie Ellender. He was an All-American for the Arkansas State Indians (now Red Wolves) and has since been voted by fans the Top Player in Arkansas State history. He was a charter member of Delta Eta chapter of Kappa Alpha Order at ASU. He graduated in 1969 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physical education, and a commission in the Army Reserves.

Originally positioned at offensive lineman and noseguard, he was moved to linebacker in 1966. At ASU, Bergey set records for best tackling average in a season, most fumble recoveries in a season, most tackles in a game, most tackles in a season, and most career tackles. He once had 33 tackles in a single game, and averaged 19.6 tackles per game in 1968.

He played in three post-season all-star games during his ASU career (the Senior Bowl, the North–South Game, and one of the last Chicago All-Star games, against the New York Jets). Bergey was selected to the All-Southland Conference team three times and to the Southland Conference All-First Decade Team. Bergey&#x27;s jersey number 66 was retired by ASU, and he was the first person to go up on its Wall of Fame. He was inducted into ASU&#x27;s Hall of Honor in 1982. Despite the accolades, Bergey&#x27;s southern schoolmates would physically fight with the &quot;Yankee&quot; from western New York, and his actual time at ASU in Jonesboro was difficult.

==Professional career==
===Cincinnati Bengals===
Bergey was drafted by the American Football League&#x27;s Cincinnati Bengals in the second round of the 1969 NFL/AFL draft, the 31st overall selection. He was chosen as an AFL All-Star in his rookie year, for the game held on January 17, 1970. He had two interceptions for the Bengals in his rookie year. For his efforts as a rookie, he was named the AFL Defensive Rookie of the Year by the Associated Press, the final selections made for the AFL as a league prior to the merger.

Bergey played under Hall of Fame coach Paul Brown at Cincinnati. He recorded three interceptions in the 1970 season, the first year for the team in the NFL. The Bengals made the postseason that year, losing to the Baltimore Colts in the divisional round 17–0, but Bergey did not record a statistic. He recorded a fumble recovery to go with an unofficial &quot;sack&quot;. He recorded an interception in his next two combined seasons (1971–1972). In his final season with Cincinnati in 1973, he had three interceptions and recovered three fumbles.

===Florida Blazers and trade to Philadelphia Eagles===
Bergey signed a personal service contract on April 17, 1974, with the Washington Capitols, the owner of the World Football League (WFL)&#x27;s Virginia Ambassadors, which would later become the Florida Blazers once the circuit began play in July of that year. He was to have joined the WFL team in May 1976, after his contract with the Cincinnati Bengals expired following the 1975 season. However, the Bengals filed suit against Bergey for breach of contract and a temporary restraining order against the WFL and its franchises two days later on April 19. In the hearing, which began on April 29 and was adjudicated 15 days later on May 14, the court concluded that Bergey had not breached his contract and the Bengals&#x27; motion for a temporary injunction was denied.

Bergey did not receive compensation from the Blazers and was released from his WFL contract. He was traded from the Bengals to the Philadelphia Eagles for a 1977 first-round selection, Wilson Whitley, and first- and second-round picks in 1978, Ross Browner and Ray Griffin respectively, on July 10, 1974.

In July 1974, Bergey signed a five-year contract with the Eagles. The Blazers ceased operating following the 1974 season, and the WFL itself ceased business in 1975.

===Philadelphia Eagles===
Bergey played a key role in the Eagles&#x27; subsequent rise, culminating in the trip to Super Bowl XV. With the Eagles, Bergey, a four-time Pro Bowl selection as an Eagle (1974, 1976–1978), set the NFL record for most interceptions by a linebacker and became the highest-paid defensive player in the league with a four-year contract for $1 million. He earned Eagles MVP status three times from the votes of his teammates. In his first year with the Eagles, Bergey was runner up to &quot;Mean&quot; Joe Greene for defensive player of the year.

Bergey played 91 games as an Eagle, and started every game in six of the seven years in Philadelphia, with 18 interceptions and 15 fumble recoveries. Bergey recorded 233 tackles in a single season with the Eagles, and once held the league record for interceptions by a linebacker with five. He was a popular player who was the foundation of the &quot;Gang Green&quot; defense that brought the Eagles back to the playoffs in 1978, 1979 and 1980. They went all the way to the Super Bowl in 1981 after winning the NFC championship game against the Dallas Cowboys 20–7 in the 1980 season. He suffered a serious knee injury in 1979. He returned in 1980, but it would be Bergey&#x27;s last season. His ability level was reduced by the injury (he evaluated it at 65%), and he could no longer reach runners in time to make the play; but he was still named All NFC by the &quot;Sporting News&quot; and went to the Super Bowl.

Bergey played 159 games and recorded nearly 1,200 tackles. He was first or second team All Pro/All NFL or All NFC from 1974 to 1978 (1974 All-Pro Team, 1975 All-Pro Team, 1976 All-Pro Team, 1977 All-Pro Team, 1978 All-Pro Team). He finished his career with 27 interceptions that he returned for 397 yards, 16 unofficial sacks (beginning in 1970), and 21 fumble recoveries.

Bergey had conflicts with guard Conrad Dobler of the Eagles&#x27; NFC East rival St. Louis Cardinals, who once spit on him while he was downed and injured. His and Dobler&#x27;s volatile relationship was ranked by NFL Films at No. 9 on the NFL Top 10 list of feuds.

Bergey retired from professional football in 1981, his last game being Super Bowl XV. He was inducted into the Eagles Roll of Honor in 1988 with Tommy McDonald. In 2012, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Bergey to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2012. He is considered one of the top Eagles of all time. He was inducted into the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame in 2011. The same year, the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association recognized Bergey with its Living Legend Award.

==Personal life and death==
During his playing days, Bergey served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserve.

Bergey served as a color commentator on radio broadcasts of the Philadelphia Eagles from 1982 to 1983. He also provided pre-game and post-game radio and television commentary for the team during the season for over 20 years.

Bergey was a plaintiff in the concussion related lawsuit against the NFL filed and settled in a Philadelphia federal court.

Bergey later lived in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania with his wife Micky Kay. He had three sons and multiple grandchildren. He is a member of the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame (2004). In 1989, he became a member of the Chautauqua Sports Hall of Fame.

His son Jake Bergey is a retired lacrosse player for the Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League and his son Josh Bergey is a retired lacrosse player for the Chesapeake Bayhawks of the Major League Lacrosse. Bill&#x27;s brother Bruce Bergey was a standout player for the Portland Storm of the WFL.

In the film &quot;Silver Linings Playbook&quot;, Robert De Niro&#x27;s character Pat Solitano Sr., an Eagles fanatic, wears a number 66 Bill Bergey jersey.

Bergey was diagnosed with oral cancer in 2021 and determinedly fought in response to the disease, finding encouragement and inspiration from others, including former Buffalo Bills quarterback Jim Kelly.

In October 2024, Bergey was among 60 former players under consideration for the 2025 Pro Football Hall of Fame class in the Senior category, though he did not make it to the next round of 31 candidates.

Bergey died from cancer in Chadds Ford on December 25, 2024. He was 79.

<doc id="481723" wikidata="Q4908696" url="?curid=481723" title="Bill Davidson (American football, born 1935)">
<text>Bill &quot;Bull&quot; Davidson (January 21, 1935 – May 2, 1999) was an American football player and coach and college athletics administrator. He served as the head football coach at Arkansas State University from 1971 to 1978, compiling a record of 51–32–1. Davidson coached his 1975 team to a perfect season during its first year at the NCAA Division I level and was later inducted into the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame.

==Playing career==
Davidson attended high school at Manila, Arkansas where he played baseball and basketball since Manila did not have a football team at the time. In 1953, he enrolled at Arkansas State and went out for the football team. During his career as a player, he lettered three times as a center and linebacker.

==Coaching career==
After graduating from college, Davidson coached high school football and earned a 28–7 record at Earle, Arkansas from 1957 to 1959 and a 28–5–1 record at Jonesboro High School from 1960 to 1962. He took the offensive coordinator and offensive line coach positions at Arkansas State in 1963.

Davidson amassed a 51–32–1 record as head coach of the Arkansas State Indians, now the Red Wolves, football team from 1971 to 1978. This record included a perfect 11–0 season in 1975. Davidson also participated in an 11–0 perfect season as an assistant coach in 1970, with the team earning the NCAA College Division national championship. When head coach Bennie Ellender headed to his alma mater Tulane, Davidson was elevated to the head coaching job. ASU&#x27;s record with Davidson as an assistant coach from 1963 to 1970 was 52–20–4. Davidson coached 11 All-Americans during his tenure.

During Davidson&#x27;s tenure, ASU gained a reputation as a physically tough and intimidating team. In 1975, ASU moved to NCAA Division I and dominated all eleven teams they faced that year by a combined score of 355–81. Davidson&#x27;s team trailed only twice after half-time the entire year and never in the fourth quarter. ASU led the nation in rushing that year at 340.5 yards per game and ranked in the national top ten in seven defensive categories. Davidson&#x27;s team took 13 of 22 slots on the Southland Conference&#x27;s all conference team. Nearly 20 of Davidson&#x27;s players from the 1975 perfect team were signed by NFL teams. Davidson earned the Southland Conference Coach of the Year that year and the team established the nation&#x27;s longest winning streak (15 games) at the time. The 1975 season was almost unimaginable for a small college in its first year at the Division I level.

==Administrative career==
Davidson retired as Arkansas State head coach in 1978 due to health problems. Davidson earned the Southland Conference Coach of the Year trophy again in his last year. Davidson returned to work in the 1980s when he served as an associate athletic director for the school.

<text>Jean Carmet (; 25 April 1920 – 20 April 1994) was a French actor.

==Life and career==
Jean Carmet began working on stage and then in film in the early 1940s becoming a very popular comedic actor in his native country. He is best known internationally for his role as a French colonist in the 1976 film, &quot;La Victoire en Chantant&quot; (Black and White in Color).

Because of his good-natured manner, he was as popular with members of the film crew as he was with the audiences. During his long career, he appeared in more than 200 films, and although he sometimes played dramatic parts, he more often acted in a supporting role as a comedic character.

He was nominated for the César Award for Best Actor for his leading role in the 1986 film, &quot;Miss Mona&quot;. Twice he won the César Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and was nominated on two other occasions. In February 1994, to celebrate his 50th year in film, he was honored by the French motion picture industry with a special César Award. Just a few months later, Jean Carmet died of a heart attack.

Jean Carmet is interred in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris. In his birthplace of Bourgueil, a theater and an avenue were named in his honor.

<text>The [[César Award]] for Best Actress in a Supporting Role (French: &quot;César de la meilleure actrice dans un second rôle&quot;) is one of the César Awards, presented annually by the &quot;Académie des Arts et Techniques du Cinéma&quot; to recognize the outstanding performance in a supporting role of an actress who has worked within the French film industry during the year preceding the ceremony. Nominees and winner are selected via a run-off voting by all the members of the Académie.

==History==

===Superlatives===
As of 2019, 137 actresses have been nominated in the category, with a total of 34 different winners. The average age at first nomination is 41 and the average age of winners at first win is 38.

With three wins (1991, 1993, 1999), Dominique Blanc holds the record of most César Award for Best Supporting Actress. Eight actresses have won the César twice: Marie-France Pisier (1976, 1977), Nathalie Baye (1981, 1982), Suzanne Flon (1984, 1990), Annie Girardot (1996, 2002), Valérie Lemercier (1994, 2007), Julie Depardieu (2004, 2008), Anne Alvaro (2001, 2011) and Karin Viard (2003, 2019).

Marie-France Pisier and Nathalie Baye have won their two awards in consecutive years. Along with Adèle Haenel, they are the only three performers to have won two competitive acting César in a row. Including her Best Actress César won in 1983, Nathalie Baye is also the only performer to have won an acting César in three consecutive years, in 1981, 1982 and 1983.

Noémie Lvovsky and Karin Viard tie for the record of most nominations with 6, Lvovsky also holding the record of most nominations without ever winning the award. Stéphane Audran holds the record of most consecutive nominations with 3 (1982, 1983, 1984).

Nine women have won both the César Award for Best Supporting Actress and the César Award for Best Actress:
* Nathalie Baye (Best Supporting Actress in 1981 and 1982, Best Actress in 1983 and 2006),
* Annie Girardot (Best Actress in 1977, Best Supporting Actress in 1996 and 2002),
* Dominique Blanc (Best Supporting Actress in 1991, 1993 and 1999, Best Actress in 2001),
* Karin Viard (Best Actress in 2000, Best Supporting Actress in 2003 and 2019),
* Marion Cotillard (Best Supporting Actress in 2005, Best Actress in 2008),
* Emmanuelle Devos (Best Actress in 2002, Best Supporting Actress in 2010),
* Adèle Haenel (Best Supporting Actress in 2014, Best Actress in 2015),
* Catherine Frot (Best Supporting Actress in 1997, Best Actress in 2016).
* Fanny Ardant (Best Actress in 1997, Best Supporting Actress in 2020),

Nathalie Baye is the only actress with multiple wins in both categories.

Three films have received both accolades: &quot;One Deadly Summer&quot; in 1984 (Best Actress to Isabelle Adjani, Best Supporting Actress to Suzanne Flon), &quot;Indochine&quot; in 1993 (Best Actress to Catherine Deneuve, Best Supporting Actress to Dominique Blanc) and &quot;Queen Margot&quot; in 1995 (Best Actress to Isabelle Adjani, Best Supporting Actress to Virna Lisi).

Three women have won the César Award for Best Supporting Actress after previously winning the César Award for Most Promising Actress:
* Charlotte Gainsbourg (Most Promising Actress in 1986, Best Supporting Actress in 2000),
* Julie Depardieu (Most Promising Actress in 2004, Best Supporting Actress in 2004 and 2008),
* Cécile de France (Most Promising Actress in 2003, Best Supporting Actress in 2006).

Both Cécile de France and Julie Depardieu have won their two awards with a same role: Isabelle, an Erasmus student, in &quot;The Spanish Apartment&quot; (Most Promising Actress) and its sequel &quot;Russian Dolls&quot; (Best Supporting Actress) for de France, and Jeanne-Marie in &quot;Little Lili&quot; (both awards) for Depardieu.

Therefore, Depardieu is the only individual to have won two acting César for the same performance. This achievement is no longer possible as the Académie has since modified nomination rules to ensure that no individual could be nominated in more than one acting category (Best Actor/Actress or Best Supporting Actor/Actress or Most Promising Actor/Actress) for the same film.

Three films has received both accolades: &quot;An Impudent Girl&quot; in 1986 (Best Supporting Actress to Bernadette Lafont, Most Promising Actress to Charlotte Gainsbourg), &quot;Life Is a Long Quiet River&quot; in 1989 (Best Supporting Actress to Hélène Vincent, Most Promising Actress to Catherine Jacob) and &quot;Little Lili&quot; in 2004 (both awards to Julie Depardieu).

Thirteen women have received nominations in the three competitive acting categories: Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress and Most Promising Actress. They are Emmanuelle Béart, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Dominique Blanc, Anne Brochet, Karin Viard, Sandrine Kiberlain, Emmanuelle Devos, Cécile de France, Marion Cotillard, Sylvie Testud, Emilie Dequenne, Sara Forestier and Adèle Haenel. So far, no actress has achieved to win the three awards.

To date, the most long-lived winner is Suzanne Flon, who died at 87, and the most short-lived is Valérie Benguigui, who died at 47. The oldest alive winner is Hélène Vincent, aged 75, and the earliest alive winner is Nicole Garcia (&quot;Le Cavaleur&quot;, 1980).

===International presence===
As the César Awards are centered on the French Cinema, the majority of recipients are French and performed in French language. However, the Best Supporting Actress César has been awarded five times to a non-French actress:
* in 1995 to Italian actress Virna Lisi for her performance in &quot;Queen Margot&quot;;
* in 2006 to Belgian actress Cécile de France for her performance in &quot;Russian Dolls&quot;;

==Winners and nominees==
Following the AATC&#x27;s practice, the films below are listed by year of ceremony, which corresponds to the year following the film&#x27;s year of release. For example, the César for Best Supporting Actress of 2010 was awarded on February 27, 2010 for a performance in a film released between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009.

Actresses are selected via a two-round vote: first round to choose the nominees, second round to designate the winner. All the members of the Académie, without regard to their branch, are eligible to vote on both rounds. Initially set to four, the number of nominees was expanded to five in 1984.

Winners are listed first in bold, followed by the other nominees in alphabetic order.

<text>Euine Fay Jones (January 31, 1921 – August 30, 2004) was an American architect and designer. An apprentice of Frank Lloyd Wright during his professional career, Jones is the only one of Wright&#x27;s disciples to have received the AIA Gold Medal (1990), the highest honor awarded by the American Institute of Architects. He also achieved international prominence as an architectural educator during his 35 years of teaching at the University of Arkansas School of Architecture.

His Thorncrown Chapel was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000, 20 years after it was built, in recognition of its architectural significance. It also has received a Twenty-five Year Award from the American Institute of Architects and other professional recognition.

==Early life==
E. Fay Jones, (first name Euine, which is pronounced &quot;U-wan&quot; and is an old Welsh form of John), was born in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, on January 31, 1921. Jones became the only surviving child in his family after both of his sisters died at an early age. His family moved to Little Rock, and later to El Dorado, Arkansas, where he worked in the family restaurant. Jones was a longtime member of the Boy Scouts of America and earned the rank of Eagle Scout.

Jones&#x27;s interest in architecture began with the design of treehouses in grammar school and high school. One of his houses had a working brick fireplace and roll-up doors and screens. In 1938, after being inspired by a short film about the Johnson Wax Headquarters, designed by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, Jones decided to pursue a career in architecture. Jones hoped to earn an appointment to the United States Naval Academy and took civil engineering classes at the University of Arkansas to improve his chances. While enrolled, he was a brother of Kappa Sigma fraternity. Jones&#x27;s hopes were dashed after his congressman was defeated for reelection and was unable to offer an appointment.

Jones married Mary Elizabeth &quot;Gus&quot; Knox on January 6, 1943 in San Francisco. The couple had two daughters, Janis and Cami.

== Military experience ==
At the outbreak of World War II, Jones joined the United States Navy and served in the Pacific theater of operations for fifteen months as a naval aviator piloting torpedo and dive bombers, though not in combat. He attained the rank of lieutenant.

==Post-war period==
Jones returned to Little Rock after the war, where he worked as a draftsman for an architectural engineering firm. His talents were noticed, and he was encouraged to return to the University of Arkansas in 1946 to enroll in the new architecture program started by John G. Williams. Jones obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in architecture in 1950, aided by the GI Bill. 

He had a graduate teaching fellowship at Rice University in Houston, Texas, where he obtained a master&#x27;s degree in architecture in 1951. While in Houston, at the prompting of Williams, Jones attended the 1949 American Institute of Architects conference in hopes of catching a glimpse of Wright, who was receiving that year’s Gold Medal. Jones was introduced to Wright at an after-convention party where he spent 30 minutes discussing Wright&#x27;s views on architecture.

Bruce Goff offered Jones a teaching position at the University of Oklahoma, which he accepted from 1951 to 1953. Goff became a mentor and a friend to Jones, giving him another perspective on modern architecture. Jones applied for an apprenticeship at Wright&#x27;s winter workshop, Taliesin West, near Scottsdale, Arizona. Later, Wright invited Jones&#x27; entire family to his home and design institute, Taliesin, in Spring Green, Wisconsin.

Jones returned to both Taliesin studios numerous times as both friend and apprentice, becoming a Taliesin Fellow in 1953. Jones greatly admired Wright, but soon established a private practice in the Ozark Mountains of northwest Arkansas. 

He joined the faculty of the department of architecture at the University of Arkansas at Wright&#x27;s suggestion, later serving as the first dean of the U of A School of Architecture. In 1984, the ACSA (Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture) honored Jones with the ACSA Distinguished Professor Award.

==Design career==
Jones preferred the rural quiet of the Arkansas mountains to the urban landscape. He ignored architectural trends and developed his own organic aesthetic with materials found in The Ozarks and familiar traditional forms from his home region. Jones&#x27;s work focused primarily on the intimate rather than the grandiose. His most renowned works were chapels and private homes, rather than skyscrapers. 

Former President Bill Clinton wrote about one of Jones’s homes in his 2004 autobiography &quot;My Life.&quot; Clinton had lived in Fayetteville in the 1970s while teaching at the University of Arkansas law school, and moved into a Jones home near the campus. Clinton called it a “perfect place to live, a beautiful little house.”

Jones used Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s principles, but made unique buildings. His most famous buildings were the Thorncrown Chapel in Eureka Springs, Arkansas; the Mildred B. Cooper Memorial Chapel in Bella Vista, Arkansas; the Pinecote Pavilion at the Crosby Arboretum in Picayune, Mississippi; and the Anthony Chapel located at Garvan Woodland Gardens in Hot Springs, Arkansas which was built by his partner, Maurice Jennings. These buildings were simple and transcendental creations of wood. In a poll of the membership of the American Institute of Architects, Thorncrown Chapel was ranked as the fourth most favored building. Thorncrown was also selected as the best American building constructed since 1980.

Jones also designed the Marty Leonard Chapel in Fort Worth, Texas, which was built in 1990. In 1997, his John B. Begley Chapel was dedicated on the campus of Lindsey Wilson College in Columbia, Kentucky. The Begley Chapel was Jones&#x27;s first all-brick chapel.

The architect was also known for creating unique designs for furniture such as his stacking stool in the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum collection and public art projects, such as the Fulbright Peace Fountain located at the University of Arkansas main campus. 

Jones viewed architecture as 
&quot;the science and art of building, both of these things. But, it&#x27;s more than mere construction or mere building or the technical putting together of things. It&#x27;s more than mere accommodation, or, certainly not just stylistic notions; it must transcend these things, and it&#x27;s something that the human spirit has to be involved with.&quot;

Jones was recalled as a gentle and unassuming man. His business partner, Maurice Jennings, stated that he had worked with Jones for 25 years without one instance of emotional conflict.

== Death ==
On August 31, 2004, Jones died at his home in Fayetteville, Arkansas at the age of 83 from heart and lung failure, complicated by Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He was survived by his wife and two daughters.

==Legacy and honors==
*2009, the University of Arkansas School of Architecture was dedicated in Jones&#x27;s honor. After a multi-million-dollar contribution from Don and Ellen Edmondson, the school is now known as the Fay Jones School of Architecture and Design.
*1994, a retrospective of his work was produced for the Old State House Museum in Little Rock, Arkansas. It is available from the museum as a traveling exhibition. The University of Arkansas also published a driving tour of many of his residences and buildings in Northwest Arkansas.
*1990, Jones received the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal.
*1980, he was accepted as a Fellow of the American Academy in Rome.
*1979, he was accepted as a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects.
*Jones received honorary degrees from four institutions: Kansas State University, Drury College, the University of Arkansas, and Hendrix College.

<text>John Patrick Daly (born April 28, 1966) is an American professional golfer on the PGA Tour and PGA Tour Champions. Daly is known primarily for his driving distance off the tee (earning him the nickname &quot;Long John&quot;), his non-country-club appearance and attitude, his exceptionally long backswing, the inconsistency of his play (with exceptional performances and controversial incidents), and his personal life. His two greatest on-course accomplishments are his &quot;zero-to-hero&quot; victory in the 1991 PGA Championship, and his playoff victory over Costantino Rocca in the 1995 Open Championship.

In addition to his wins on U.S. soil, Daly has won accredited pro events in South Africa, Swaziland (Eswatini), Scotland, Germany, South Korea, Turkey, and Canada.

According to official performance statistics kept since 1980, Daly in 1997 became the first PGA Tour player to average more than 300 yards per drive over a full season. He did so again in every year from 1999 to 2008, and he was the only player to do so until 2003. Daly also led the PGA Tour in driving distance 11 times from 1991 to 2002 with the exception of 1994 when Davis Love III took his spot that year.

Daly&#x27;s last PGA Tour victory came in San Diego in 2004, earning him a two-year playing exemption. After 2006, Daly&#x27;s career began to falter and he had trouble making cuts and staying on the tour. He was primarily earning PGA Tour event entries through past champion status and numerous sponsor invitations. Since 2016, Daly has competed on the PGA Tour Champions circuit, winning the 2017 Insperity Invitational.

Daly is the only man from either Europe or the United States to win two major golf championships but not be selected for the Ryder Cup since that event began in 1927.

Daly has been successful in multiple businesses. He is endorsed by LoudMouth Golf Apparel and owns a golf course design company. In addition, Daly has written and recorded music, and has released two music albums.

==Early life==
Daly was born in Carmichael, California, on April 28, 1966. His father is Jim Daly, a construction worker for industrial plants; his mother is Lou Daly, a homemaker. The Daly family, solidly working-class, moved very frequently during Daly&#x27;s formative years, living in small towns across the Southern states. His father frequently worked night shifts, and often had to commute significant distances between work and home.

With his father, mother, older sister and older brother Jamie, John moved from California to Dardanelle, Arkansas, when he was four years old. John began playing golf the following year, at the Bay Ridge Boat and Golf Club there. From his start in golf, Daly admired Jack Nicklaus, the dominant professional player of the time. When John was ten, his family moved to Locust Grove, Orange County, Virginia. John played golf there at the Lake of the Woods Golf Course in Locust Grove, where he won the spring club championship at age 13, defeating all the male members; the club promptly changed its rules, barring juniors from future open club competition. The Dalys next moved to Zachary, Louisiana, where John completed ninth grade and half of the tenth grade.

John then attended Helias High School in Jefferson City, Missouri, the state capital, from the middle of his sophomore year, and was a junior golf member at the Jefferson City Country Club. He was a letterman there in football and golf. With John handling both punting and place-kicking duties, Helias football compiled a 10–0 record in 1983. In golf, John was a 1983 Missouri state team HS champion with Helias; he also holds several Helias school kicking records in football.

For his first significant golf success, Daly won the 1983 Missouri State Amateur Championship and then followed up by winning the 1984 Arkansas State Amateur Championship. Daly completed his final three months of high school at Dardanelle High School in spring 1984. Back at the Bay Ridge club that summer, Daly became friends with Rick Ross, who was a golf teaching professional there, and Ross assisted him with his golf game for the next several years.

==Amateur career==
Daly attended the University of Arkansas, from 1984 to 1987, on a golf scholarship, and was a member of the golf team. His golf team coaches were Steve Loy and Bill Woodley. Daly had tempestuous relationships with both due to his drinking problems and infrequent class attendance. Daly qualified for the 1986 U.S. Open, one of the four majors of male professional golf, as an amateur, and missed the 36-hole cut with scores of 88 and 76.

==Professional career==
Daly left college without completing his degree and turned professional in summer 1987. His first pro victory came shortly afterwards, in the 1987 Missouri Open. From 1987 to 1989, Daly played mainly in minor events around the U.S., and had some encouraging success during the 1989–90 season on the Southern African Tour. He won the AECI Charity Classic with only Northern Irishman David Feherty behind him. Daly also won the Hollard Royal Swazi Sun Classic over South African veteran John Bland.

=== Ben Hogan Tour ===
Daly earned full playing privileges on the Ben Hogan Tour for 1990, winning the qualifying tournament for the new circuit early that year. He then won two Sunshine Tour events early in 1990, one in South Africa (where he edged David Feherty), and one in Swaziland (where established veteran champion John Bland placed second). This was encouraging for Daly to win good-caliber events, defeat more experienced and well-established international professionals, and play before good-sized galleries which appreciated his performances.

Daly then won the 1990 Ben Hogan Utah Classic, and completed a fine year by finishing T-12 at the 1990 PGA Tour Qualifying Tournament, earning 1991 PGA Tour privileges on his fourth attempt.

===PGA Tour===
He joined the PGA Tour in 1991, showed increasingly strong play throughout the year, and then won the PGA Championship that August. This victory gained Daly a significant amount of media attention, due to the fact that Daly was the ninth and final alternate for the Championship. Just days before the tournament Nick Price dropped out, since his wife Sue was about to give birth. Daly, playing just his third major, was able to have Price&#x27;s caddie Jeff (Squeaky) Medlin caddy for him. Daly had to drive through the night to arrive in time to claim his spot. A virtual unknown at the time, he achieved a first-round score of 69, even though he had not had time to play a practice round at the exceptionally difficult Crooked Stick Golf Club course near Indianapolis. He finished the tournament with scores of 69-67-69-71, giving him a three-stroke victory over veteran Bruce Lietzke, who was 15 years older. His feat generated enormous media coverage, propelling the hitherto virtually unknown Tour rookie to international fame. 
Late in the season, Daly finished 3rd place at the 1991 Tour Championship. He then became the first PGA Tour rookie to be invited to compete in the Skins Game, a made-for-television event featuring four top players, and he performed well there finishing 2nd.
Daly was subsequently named PGA Tour Rookie of the Year for 1991. He was also the first rookie to win a major title since Jerry Pate won the U.S. Open in 1976.

His surprise victory and powerful swing provided the impetus for a cult-like fan base, composed of many people who had not been previously attracted to golf, and from that point onwards, Daly became one of the most popular players on Tour. He added to his reputation as a power hitter in 1993 by becoming, apparently, the first (and still the only) player to reach the green of the famous 630-yard hole 17 at Baltusrol Golf Club&#x27;s Lower Course in two strokes.

Daly had a good season in 1992. However, not the season that many expected from a major champion. Under pressure from his zero-to-hero victory at the 1991 PGA Championship, Daly started the 1992 season with several top 10 finishes: including finishing 5th place at The International, T-2 at the Kemper Open, and T-8 at the Buick Southern Open and the Nissan Los Angeles Open. At the 1992 PGA Championship, Daly struggled as the defending champion. He finished the tournament with rounds of 76-72-79-77 and ended up finishing in 82nd place. However, he recovered to win the B.C. Open by six strokes late in the season, for his second PGA Tour title.

Daly did not have a great season in 1993. He did however finish T-3 at the Masters Tournament and it became his only top-10 finish in a major championship outside his two wins. With no PGA Tour wins in 1993, Daly did manage to win the Alfred Dunhill Cup with Fred Couples and Payne Stewart. He had five top-25 finishes and one top-10 finish out of 15 cuts.

In 1994, Daly experienced one of his most turbulent years. He was suspended by the PGA Tour from late 1993 into early 1994, due to behavior which included walking off the course mid-round during the 1993 late-season Kapalua International. The suspension also covered a mid-1993 incident at the Kemper Open, when he was upset after scoring a 77, threw his scorecard at the scoring tent, and was disqualified. The suspension covered another incident at the 1993 Southern Open where Daly walked off the course without telling his partners he was quitting. He entered alcohol rehab for three weeks in late 1993 and then returned to the Tour and won the 1994 BellSouth Classic, claiming it was his first win sober. This was his third PGA Tour title.

In 1995, in the midst of a middling season, Daly unexpectedly won The Open Championship in a playoff with Italy&#x27;s Costantino Rocca at the Old Course, St Andrews. Daly had prior excellent results on this course at the Dunhill Cup, and although he was listed at very long odds by bookies, some perceptive golf watchers, including David Feherty, believed before the event that the Old Course in fact suited Daly&#x27;s game very well. Daly was in contention from the start of the event, but trailed New Zealand&#x27;s Michael Campbell heading into a very windy final round. Campbell fell back in the difficult conditions, and Daly played a superb final round. As Rocca, in the last group, approached the final hole, he was one shot behind Daly, who had already finished his round. Rocca&#x27;s long drive was only yards from the green, but his second shot resulted in a fluffed chip where he did not follow through. Rocca then sank a 60-foot (18 metre) putt to make the birdie he needed to force a playoff with Daly. Daly easily defeated Rocca in the playoff, finishing the four holes of the playoff at one under par, while Rocca finished three over par after hitting into the &quot;Road Hole Bunker&quot; on the 17th hole, and taking three shots to get out.

Daly is the only eligible two-time major winner never selected to play in the Ryder Cup.

=== 1996–2000: struggles ===
After winning the 1995 Open Championship, Daly struggled with his golf game and drinking habits for the next nine years. This caused Daly to suffer a four-year win drought on the European Tour and a nine-year win drought on the PGA Tour. In 1996, Daly finished T-19 at The Players Championship and had a top-10 finish at the Kemper Open. At the 1996 U.S. Open, Daly finished T-27 with a final round 73, his best finish in the tournament. Daly&#x27;s only win in 1996 was at the AT&amp;T Australian Skins Game which was neither a PGA or European Tour event.

In 1997, Daly started off the season by finishing 7th place at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. Afterwards, Daly&#x27;s struggles at the time culminated into one of his worst seasons on the PGA Tour withdrawing from the U.S. Open after a first round 77 due to his physical condition and alcoholic shakes. It is reported that Daly was attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. During the 1997 Players Championship, Daly opened with a round of 76. Afterward, he reportedly spent three hours drinking at a nightspot and subsequently destroyed his hotel room. Daly was later hospitalized for chest pains and ultimately withdrew from the tournament. Late in the season, Daly was tied for the lead in the first round of the 1997 PGA Championship scoring 66 with birdies on the last three holes. This momentum quickly vanished as Daly shot a third round 77. After falling out of contention, Daly drove a ball out of bounds and threw his club into the woods. During the final round, Daly hit a long drive off the tee, but the ball ended up in an unplayable lie. A rules official denied Daly&#x27;s request for relief, which led to a heated argument and left Daly irritated. Despite shooting 70 in the final round, Daly finished the tournament tied for 29th place.

In 1998, Daly recorded one of the highest scores on a single hole in PGA Tour golf history, shooting an 18 on the sixth hole at the Bay Hill Invitational. Daly finished the 1998 season with two top-10 finishes including finishing T-16 at the Player&#x27;s Championship with a final round 69, his best finish in the tournament. He also withdrew from the Sprint International and the Disney Classic and was disqualified from the FedEx St. Jude Classic.

In 1999, Daly won the JCPenney Classic, which was neither a PGA or European Tour event. Despite this, Daly did not have a good season in 1999 where he only had three top-25 finishes and withdrew from several tournaments. Daly also scored high rounds of 82 at the Memorial Tournament and 83 at the Player&#x27;s Championship. At the 1999 U.S. Open, Daly finished 68th place after leading the tournament in the first round. After some struggles during the tournament, Daly said he would never play in the U.S. Open again, he later apologized for this. In 2000, Daly had a horrific season on the PGA Tour only having one top-25 finish at the Honda Classic. He also withdrew from the U.S. Open after shooting an opening round 83.

=== 2001: win in Germany ===
In 2001, Daly won the BMW International Open with a one-stroke lead over Pádraig Harrington, with a personal best score of 27 under par for four rounds. This was the first time Daly had won a European Tour event in six years. After Daly had a comeback to the European Tour, he also had his best PGA Tour season since 1995. His best result was finishing 4th place at the Bell Canadian Open.

=== 2002–2003: three wins away from major tours, two team wins ===
In 2002, Daly was inducted into the Arkansas Golf Hall of Fame, and had two top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour which were 4th-place finishes at the Buick Invitational and the Phoenix Open. Daly also made the cut at the 2002 Masters finishing T-32, the last time he would make the cut at the Masters. He also won the Champions Challenge that year, which was neither a PGA or European Tour event. In 2003, Daly did not have a good season, finishing T-7 at the Shell Houston Open, and winning two other tournaments that were neither PGA Tour or European Tour events. However, In both 2002 and 2003, Daly was a member of the winning PGA Tour team in the Wendy&#x27;s 3-Tour Challenge event, competing against teams from the Champions Tour and the LPGA Tour.

=== 2004: comeback ===
Daly won the Buick Invitational in 2004, and he was also selected as PGA Tour Comeback Player of the Year for 2004. Daly won the tournament in a playoff against Luke Donald and Chris Riley. Daly started using Dunlop golf equipment before this tournament, and the Buick Invitational was his first victory in 189 PGA Tour events. At the time, Daly had not won a PGA Tour event since 1995 and did not win one on American soil since 1994. This was considered a huge comeback as Daly increased his world golf ranking from 299th to a spot in the Top 50 during this time frame. Daly also finished 2nd place at the Buick Open. Overall, Daly ranked 4th on the PGA Tour for the 2004 season making the cut 17 times out of 22 events.

=== 2005–2006: two near-misses ===
In 2005, Daly lost two playoffs in PGA Tour events to two of world golf&#x27;s biggest stars. First, he was defeated by Vijay Singh&#x27;s par on the first extra hole at the Houston Open. Then, he missed a two-foot putt on the second extra hole to lose to Tiger Woods at the WGC-American Express Championship in San Francisco.

Fans and golf columnists point to the 2005 WGC-American Express Championship as the event where John Daly&#x27;s post-2006 exempt status would be determined. Tied with Tiger Woods at the end of regulation play, Daly missed a short par putt on the 2nd extra playoff hole, giving Woods the victory. Had Daly instead made the par, and then had gone on to win, he would have earned a three-year PGA Tour exemption through 2008. Daly also made it to another playoff in the 2005 Shell Houston Open, but lost on the first extra hole to Vijay Singh.

Daly&#x27;s form declined in 2006, when he played in 21 events and made only 8 cuts as well as withdrawing from five events. Daly had only one Top-25 finish in 2006 finishing T-17 at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship.

=== 2007–2015: PGA Tour non-exempt status ===
Daly entered the 2007 PGA Tour season without full exempt status for the first time since his 1991 PGA Championship victory, which carried a 10-year PGA Tour exemption. Another such exemption was earned with his 1995 Open Championship win. When Daly won the 2004 Buick Invitational, he earned a two-year exemption, which expired at the end of 2006. Daly finished 193rd on the 2006 PGA Tour Official Money List, thereby losing his full exempt status for 2007.

To upgrade his non-exempt status, Daly could have re-entered the PGA Tour qualifying process, but chose not to do this, relying upon sponsor exemptions to gain entry to PGA Tour events.

Daly was invited to play in the Honda Classic on March 1, 2007, on a sponsor&#x27;s exemption, but had to withdraw after two holes. He pulled a muscle near his shoulder blade when he tried to stop his backswing after a fan snapped a picture. In December 2008, he was suspended for six months by the PGA Tour after an incident involving the Winston-Salem police.

After his 2008 suspension, Daly was forced to compete on the European Tour. After undergoing lap-band surgery to lose 40 pounds, he began playing much better golf, even managing to finish 2nd at the Italian Open. On May 26, 2009, Daly announced that he would return to the PGA Tour, via sponsor&#x27;s exemption, for the St. Jude Classic. On July 17, Daly told &quot;The Dan Patrick Show&quot; that he had lost 80 pounds thanks to the surgery, dropping him to 205 lbs.

Daly did not win another professional tournament until December 2014, when he won the Beko Classic. The tournament, played at Gloria Golf Club in Belek, Antalya, Turkey, is sanctioned by the PGA of Europe.

Daly&#x27;s last top finish on an elite tour came at the 2009 Italian Open. There he finished in a distant tie for second to Daniel Vancsik of Argentina. It punctuated how unusual Daly&#x27;s history of results had been. He recorded almost as many top finishes internationally as he did at PGA Tour events in the United States. He won two events on the South African Tour early in his career: the AECI Charity Classic and the Hollard Royal Swazi Sun Classic in 1990, an event where he had finished runner-up in 1989. Later in his career, in addition to famously winning the 1995 Open Championship in Scotland, he performed very well in regular European Tour events. He won the 2001 BMW International Open and finished runner-up at the 1994 Irish Open, 2001 German Masters, 2005 BMW International Open, and the aforementioned 2009 Italian Open. His four runner-up finishes in Europe match the amount of runner-up finishes he had at American events on the PGA Tour. He also won the 2003 Korea Open, the most prestigious event on the Korean Tour.

Although Daly had $10,270,681 in career earnings as of February 20, 2023, he is not among the top 50 on the PGA Tour&#x27;s All-Time Career Money List, and so he must now depend heavily on sponsor invitations (PGA Tour Exemption Category 11).

As far as individual tournaments are concerned, Daly is exempt for life in the PGA Championship and AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, and up to age 60 in the Open Championship. In order to play in the Masters, U.S. Open, a World Golf Championship or a FedEx Cup Playoff Event, Daly would have to satisfy the particular invitational requirements of such events. Daly has not played at the Masters since 2006, and he has not made the cut there since 2002.

However, after shooting a then personal-high 88 at the Buick Open in late July 2009, he claimed to be losing confidence in his game, and his swing coach blamed the surgery for making him lose muscle along with weight, taking power away from his swing. However, Daly blamed the effects of his poor eyesight on his putting for his high golf score.

On March 14, 2014, during the second round of the Valspar Championship, Daly shot a career worst 90 which included an 8-over-par 12 on the 16th hole. His frequent failure to make cuts and high rounds have revived debates on players who frequently receive sponsor exemptions.

Daly shot a score of 68 for the first round of the 2012 PGA Championship which was played at Kiawah Island, South Carolina. Daly finished 18th place in that tournament, which was the first time Daly had finished in the top 20 in a major championship since the Open in 2005.

Daly continued to play more abroad vs. United States due to his limited status on the PGA Tour. In the late fall of 2014 Daly started to show some promise finishing T-29 at the Sanderson Farms Championship, and then quietly finishing T-10 at the Puerto Rico Open, his first top-10 finish in three years. Soon after, Daly finished T-25 at the Turkish Airlines Open, a European Tour event with a strong field. Daly won the Beko Classic on December 6, 2014, an event sanctioned by the PGAs of Europe, finishing at −15. It was Daly&#x27;s first win in over 10 years. At the end of 2015, Daly tried to get back his European Tour card in Shanghai. He finished T-46 at the BMW Masters and T-50 at the Turkish Airlines Open failing to get back his card.

=== 2016–present: PGA Tour Champions ===
Having turned 50 on April 28, 2016, Daly became eligible to play on the PGA Tour Champions. His debut was at the Insperity Invitational in May, where he finished tied for 17th.

On May 7, 2017, Daly won the Insperity Invitational on the PGA Tour Champions after shooting a 14-under par for the tournament. It was his first win of a PGA Tour-affiliated event since 2004, and it happened exactly one year after he made his PGA Tour Champions debut. Daly continues to compete semi-regularly on the tour.

===Golf swing===
Daly has a flowing self-taught golf swing which was built for raw power and distance. Daly takes his golf club back much farther past parallel on his back swing by extreme coiling of his arms and shoulders which creates very fast club head speed on his down swing. However, Daly&#x27;s golf swing has contributed to his inconsistent performance during golf tournaments since almost perfect timing is required for proper execution of such a powerful golf swing.

===Incidents during golf tournaments===
Daly has had several incidents during golf tournaments which have contributed to his &quot;Wild Thing&quot; image including the following:
* During an exhibition clinic at the 1993 Fred Meyer Challenge, Daly started hitting balls over the heads of spectators in a grandstand to show off his driving talents. This privately infuriated fellow PGA golfer Peter Jacobsen who was the host of the event. The PGA Tour ended up making Daly pay a $30,000 fine.
* During the 1993 Kapalua International, Daly was disqualified for picking up his ball after a missed birdie putt before finishing the eleventh hole and putting the ball in his pocket. He was then suspended by the PGA Tour.
*During the 1994 PGA Tour&#x27;s NEC World Series of Golf, Daly hit several shots into the group playing in front of him on the 14th hole in the final round. Daly drove the green twice and one of those shots almost hit professional golfer Jeff Roth. This led to a scuffle between Daly and Jeff Roth&#x27;s father. They wrestled to the ground and the altercation was broken up by fans. Daly was then fined $13,000 by the PGA Tour and banned for the rest of the season.
*During the 1998 PGA Tour&#x27;s Bay Hill Invitational, Daly used a three-wood to hit six golf balls into the water during the final round. Daly finally got his seventh attempt over the water which was a distance of approximately 270 yards. Daly shot an 18 on the par-five sixth hole and finished the round with a score of 85.
*During the 1998 PGA Tour&#x27;s FedEx St. Jude Classic, Daly hit a 5-iron shot out of bounds on the par-4 17th hole, took a drop, and hit his ball with the same club again out of bounds. Daly then proceeded to break his club. He finished with a score of 74, walked off the course, and was disqualified for not signing his scorecard.
*During the 1999 U.S. Open, Daly took a two-stroke penalty for hitting his ball while it was moving on the par-4 eighth hole. He carded an 11 on the eighth hole, shot a final round score of 83, and finished 68th place. Daly said he took the penalty in protest against the USGA for placing too many unfair pins on Pinehurst No. 2&#x27;s mounded greens.
* In the 2000 U.S. Open, he shot a 14 on the par-five 18th hole and withdrew after an opening-round 83. Daly hit three golf balls into the Pacific Ocean and hit another into a backyard next to the fairway.
* At the 2002 Australian PGA Championship, after making a triple-bogey seven on his last hole at the Coolum course in Australia, Daly threw his putter and ball into a pond and later failed to sign for a 78 on his scorecard, disqualifying himself from the tournament. Daly was later fined by the Australian Tour and was ordered to write a letter of apology to a tour official he verbally abused.
* During the 2008 Australian Open, he broke a spectator&#x27;s camera at Royal Sydney&#x27;s ninth hole. He was given a suspended fine by Golf Australia.
* Daly walked off during his first round at the 2011 Australian Open after hitting all of his golf balls into the water. Daly&#x27;s problems started on the 10th hole when he received an automatic two-stroke penalty for hitting the wrong ball in the bunker. On the 11th hole, he hit seven golf balls in the water before leaving the tournament.
* In the second round of the 2015 PGA Championship at the Whistling Straits Golf Course in Haven, Wisconsin, Daly, who was at the time 1-over par right at the cut line, hit three consecutive tee shot attempts into the water of Lake Michigan at the par-3 7th hole. He used a 4-iron on the first unsuccessful try, then switched to a 6-iron on the next two failed tries. After his fourth attempt (his 7th shot), which found the green, Daly was so livid about his shot selection that he threw his 6-iron into Lake Michigan. Daly ended up scoring a septuple-bogey 10, dropping to +8. He finished the round with an 82 and missed the cut.

==Charity works==
After winning the PGA Championship at Crooked Stick Golf Club in 1991, Daly gave $30,000 to the family of a man who died during the tournament due to lightning strike. The money was used by the family to pay college expenses for the man&#x27;s two daughters. Daly was just starting his golf career and was not wealthy at the time.

Daly is known for his involvement in many charities including several in northwest Arkansas. He has donated money to his high school, the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and Boys and Girls Clubs of America. Daly is also an active supporter of the sports programs at the University of Arkansas. He shaved his signature &quot;mullet&quot;, and donated the proceeds from the event to various charities. Daly regularly plays in the celebrity Pro-Am Monday after the Masters hosted by his friends, Hootie &amp; the Blowfish.

==Business activities==
Daly is in partnership with Loudmouth Golf line of clothing, which includes licensing deals with the NFL&#x27;s Dallas Cowboys and Arkansas Razorbacks. As of 2012, sales had increased and made it difficult to meet demand. In 2014, Daly signed an endorsement deal with Rock Bottom Golf, a discount golf retailer. In 2006, he launched a wine label &quot;John Daly Wines&quot; that later went defunct. In 2023, he launched a line of cannabis products.

Daly also has a company which designs golf courses (JD Designs), including Sevillano Links at Rolling Hills Casino in Corning, California. Sevillano Links is one of the few links style golf courses in the Western United States, and named &quot;Best New Golf Course&quot; by Golfweek magazine. Other golf courses that John Daly helped design include:
* Wicked Stick Golf Links, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina (closed)
* Blarney Golf Resort, County Cork, Ireland
* Thundering Waters Golf Club, Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada
* Murder Rock Golf Club, Branson, Missouri
* The Lion&#x27;s Den, Dardanelle, Arkansas

In 2010, publisher Oxygen Games released &quot;John Daly&#x27;s Prostroke Golf&quot; for the Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. In the game, John Daly is the instructor, as well as the opponent, for players. The game includes twelve courses modeled after real-world courses, but these are locked at the outset. In order to unlock courses, players must defeat Daly in Challenges, including driving, short game, and putting. Unlocking a course allows the player to play against Daly and other players in tournaments.

==Music career==
In 2007, Daly provided back-up vocals in the Kid Rock song, &quot;Half Your Age&quot;. In April 2010, Daly released his second music album called &quot;I Only Know One Way&quot; on Long Ball Records/Hopesong Digital/GMV Nashville. He wrote and co-wrote eight tracks on the album. One track includes Hootie And The Blowfish&#x27;s lead singer Darius Rucker and a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Knockin&#x27; On Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;. John said about his perspective on his music: &quot;The album itself is really my life. All of the songs have a meaning. Most of the record is happening or has happened in my life. I hope people can relate to some of the troubles I have had along the way. Everyone around the world has problems, and I want to connect with those people.&quot; Daly&#x27;s first album, &quot;My Life&quot;, included guest vocals by Darius, Willie Nelson and Johnny Lee.

==Personal life==

===Alcohol===
One of Daly&#x27;s biggest struggles in life is alcohol and this has occurred throughout his golf career. Daly claimed that he was around 8–10 years old when he started drinking. Daly also claimed he quit drinking whiskey in 1990; he opted for other alcoholic drinks, as whiskey was interfering too much with his golf game. However, from 1989 to 1993, he was hospitalized four times for alcohol poisoning. After a stint in alcohol rehab in late 1993, he reportedly went on candy and burger eating binges to reduce the need to drink alcohol; this was in full force when Daly won the 1994 BellSouth Classic and the 1995 Open Championship.

In 1996, Daly reportedly started drinking alcohol again, claiming he only drank a few beers. He then fell back into his excessive drinking habits in 1997 and proceeded to check himself into an alcohol rehabilitation center for the second time. During this time, he also lost his sponsorships with Wilson and Reebok. During the 1998 season, as Daly was recovering from his alcoholism, he suffered alcoholic shakes during the first round of the Greater Vancouver Open. During the 1999 season, Daly relapsed and started drinking again after missing the cut at the FedEx St. Jude Classic. He then lost his sponsorship with Callaway due to his relapse.

Starting in 2000, Daly was reportedly drinking on and off throughout the decade. However, it seemed he had a lot more control over his drinking habits and rowdy behavior during the 2000s.

In March 2008, Daly&#x27;s swing coach Butch Harmon quit, saying that &quot;the most important thing in (Daly&#x27;s) life is getting drunk.&quot; Daly responded by saying, &quot;I think his lies kind of destroyed my life for a little bit.&quot;

On October 26, 2008, Daly was taken into protective custody by Winston-Salem police after being found drunk outside a Hooters restaurant. He was not arrested or charged with a violation. However, the police released his mug shot to the media which resulted in negative publicity. Shortly after this incident, Daly committed to stop drinking alcohol, which resulted in a progressive resurgence of his game and a positive change in his personal life; this was confirmed by Daly himself at The Open Championship on July 15, 2010.

In an interview on &quot;The Dan Patrick Show&quot; on August 6, 2014, Daly said that much of his past struggle with alcohol was due to growing up with an alcoholic and abusive father.

===Health===
In July 1994, Daly claimed that many PGA golfers were cocaine users, and said that if drug testing was done properly on tour, he would be &quot;one of the cleanest guys out there&quot;. This statement brought an uproar among the pro golf community.

In early 2009, he had lap-band surgery which limits the amount of food that he can consume. As of December 8, 2009, Daly had shed well over 100 pounds and was &quot;a slim, trim 185&quot;.

In July 2019, Daly had a near-death experience after being bitten by a brown recluse spider while he was vacationing in England. He had developed sepsis and required an emergency surgery.

In September 2020, Daly announced he had recently battled with bladder cancer. He underwent surgery to remove the cancer, but doctors said there was an 85 percent chance of relapse. To reduce the chance of recurrence, Daly plans to improve his previously unhealthy lifestyle which involved smoking and drinking large amounts of Diet Coke.

===Gambling===
In 1999, Daly was reported to have lost $51 million from gambling in the mid-1990s and he was feeling the effects of his gambling when he had to sell his Mercedes and his house in California. Daly claimed he would sit at blackjack tables with $220,000 on a single hand. He would bet as high as $50,000 on a football game but he never bet on a golf game. Daly also expressed great difficulty at the time in paying alimony, child support, and other expenses as less money was coming in due to his struggles on and off the golf course.

In 2006, Daly revealed in the last chapter of his autobiography that he has had great difficulty with his gambling problem. He claims to have lost between $50 and $60 million over a 15-year period. This includes losing $1.5 million in October 2005, after winning half that amount at the WGC-American Express tournament, most of it lost on a $5,000 Las Vegas slot machine at Wynn Casino.

=== Marriages ===
Daly married Dale Crafton in 1987. Crafton was a well-known hand model who came from a wealthy family in Arkansas. Daly was trying to support his wife and himself by making it to the PGA Tour. However, Daly was miserable living with Dale in her hometown of Blytheville. They divorced in 1990 due to irreconcilable differences.

In summer 1992, he married his second wife, Bettye Fulford. They had a daughter, Shynah Hale. In December 1992, Daly was charged with third-degree assault for throwing Bettye into a wall at their home near Denver. The actual circumstances of the incident remained unclear so far as public releases were concerned, since Bettye did not wish to pursue the matter. Daly has said in his autobiography that he did not, nor has he ever, hit or hurt a woman.

After Daly&#x27;s divorce with Fulford was finalized in 1995, he married Paulette Dean that same year. A daughter, Sierra Lynn, was born on June 1, 1995. The couple divorced in 1999.

On July 29, 2001, he married Sherrie Miller. Their son John Patrick Daly II was born July 23, 2003. On June 8, 2007, Daly and Sherrie got into a fight at a restaurant in Memphis, Tennessee, site of that week&#x27;s tour stop, the Stanford St. Jude Championship. Daly claims that later that night his wife attacked him with a steak knife. He showed up for his second round on Friday afternoon with cuts and scrapes across his face. Authorities were contacted by him and came to his house, but his wife had already fled the scene and taken their son with her.

Sherrie (at some point) pleaded guilty to federal drug charges and was sentenced to a five-month prison term. On December 17, 2010, in Memphis, Circuit Court Judge Donna Fields awarded custody of the couple&#x27;s seven-year-old son &quot;Little John&quot; to Daly, and jailed Sherrie for interfering with Daly&#x27;s court-ordered visitation rights and other failures to abide by the court&#x27;s orders in their ongoing divorce proceeding, saying &quot;She is not following this court&#x27;s orders. That is criminal contempt.&quot;

===Lawsuits===
In 2005, Daly sued the &quot;Florida Times-Union&quot; for libel after a columnist claimed Daly &quot;failed the scoundrel sniff test.&quot; A judge threw out the case in 2009, saying that Daly had failed to prove the basis of the libel claim: namely, that the statements were untrue. Daly was also ordered by a judge to pay the newspaper over $300,000 in legal fees.

In 2008, Daly sued Hippo Golf for using his name on a golf club they were selling without his permission. The judge ruled in favor of Daly. However, the judge also denied the motion for Hippo Golf to pay Daly any damages.

In 2010, Daly sued a children&#x27;s charity and the PGA Tour for $100 million from an injury he sustained at the 2007 Honda Classic. As of 2015, the litigation is still ongoing.

===Politics===
Daly is a Republican and vocal supporter of Donald Trump.

Daly has advocated for the legalization of cannabis in Arkansas, endorsing a ballot measure in 2022 that he said would create &quot;millions in new funding for our police, ... thousands of good jobs, [and] revenue for our state&quot;.

=== Video games ===
Daly became the first of two real people to make an appearance in the &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Golf&quot; series, appearing in the third installment, &quot;Hot Shots Golf 3&quot;; the other is Shigeki Maruyama, who appeared in &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Golf 5&quot;.

He also appears in the popular arcade golf game &quot;Golden Tee&quot;.

He appeared in the &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour&quot; video game series from 2004 to 2009.

He endorsed and featured in the 2010 video game &quot;John Daly&#x27;s ProStroke Golf&quot;.

Vorkuta is the third largest city north of the Arctic Circle and the easternmost town in Europe. It is also the coldest city in all of Europe, boasting a record cold temperature of −52 °C (−61 °F).

Vorkuta&#x27;s population has dropped steadily since the fall of the Soviet Union, when mines were privatized and many people began moving farther south. Many of the mines have been abandoned and by September 2020, the city&#x27;s estimated population was only about 50,000. A report in March 2021 described the villages in the area as &quot;ghost towns&quot; with many &quot;abandoned structures&quot;.

==History==
In 1930, the geologist Georgy Chernov (1906–2009) discovered substantial coal fields by the river Vorkuta. Georgy Chernov&#x27;s father, the geologist Alexander Chernov (1877–1963), promoted the development of the Pechora coal basin, which included the Vorkuta fields. With this discovery the coal-mining industry started in the Komi ASSR. (At the time only the southern parts of the field were included in the Komi ASSR. The northern part, including Vorkuta, belonged to the Nenets Autonomous Okrug of Arkhangelsk Oblast.) In 1931, a geologist settlement was established by the coal field, with most of the workers being inmates of the Ukhta-Pechora Camp of the GULAG (Ухтпечлаг, Ukhtpechlag).

===Forced labour camp===

The origins of the town of Vorkuta are associated with Vorkutlag, one of the most notorious forced-labour camps of the Gulag. Vorkutlag was established in 1932 with the start of mining. It was the largest of the Gulag camps in European Russia and served as the administrative centre for a large number of smaller camps and subcamps, among them Kotlas, Pechora, and Izhma (modern Sosnogorsk). The Vorkuta uprising, a major rebellion by the camp inmates, occurred in 1953.

In 1941, Vorkuta and the labour camp system based around it were connected to the rest of the world by a prisoner-built rail line linking Konosha, Kotlas, and the camps of Inta. Town status was granted to Vorkuta on November 26, 1943.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with eight urban-type settlements (Komsomolsky, Mulda, Oktyabrsky, Promyshlenny, Severny, Vorgashor, Yeletsky, and Zapolyarny) and seven rural localities, incorporated as the town of republic significance of Vorkuta—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of republic significance of Vorkuta is incorporated as Vorkuta Urban Okrug.

==Economy==
By the early 21st century, many mines had closed as problems with the high costs of operation plagued the mine operators. Near the end of the 20th century there were labor actions in the area by miners; in the late &#x27;80s due to political changes, and during the &#x27;90s by those who had not been paid for a year.

===Transport===
The town is served by Vorkuta Airport. During the Cold War, an Arctic Control Group forward staging base for strategic bombers was located at Vorkuta Sovetsky.

==Climate==
Vorkuta has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;) with short cool summers and very cold, long, and snowy winters. The average February temperature is about , and in July it is about . Vorkuta&#x27;s climate is influenced both by its distance from the North Atlantic and the proximity to the Arctic Ocean, bringing cold air in spring. This extends winters well into May and hinders the characteristic interior Russian summer warmth from reaching the city but for rare instances. In spite of this, Vorkuta has less severe winters than areas a lot further south in Siberia courtesy of the minor maritime moderation that reaches it. This also means that temperatures below have never been recorded in any winter month but December. During the winter, above-freezing temperatures are rare, but have occurred in all 12 months. With winters being humid, snowfall is a lot more common than in areas further east and a sizeable snow pack is built up each year. Due to the moderately warm summers, Vorkuta lies below the Arctic tree line.

The polar day in Vorkuta lasts from 30 May to 14 July, the polar night lasts from 17 December to 27 December.

=== Crumbling permafrost ===
Vorkuta lies on the edge of the continuous permafrost boundary in Russia, and scientists predict that continued warming could advance the border of continuous permafrost hundreds of miles northward, weakening the earth beneath the vast infrastructure built during the days of the Soviet Union&#x27;s industrialization of the Arctic.
==Demographics==
After peaking at 115,000 in 1989, Vorkuta experienced a steady population decline, with many parts of the town abandoned. By 2021, the population had declined by 50% to 57,000.

As of the 2021 Census, the ethnic composition of Vorkuta was:
* Russians – 81.7%
* Ukrainians – 4.2%
* Kyrgyz – 2.4%
* Tatars – 1.7%
* Komi – 1.3%
* Azerbaijanis – 1.1%
* Others – 7.6%

According to the former head of the executive committee of the local branch of the United Russia party, Anton Glushkov, the city&#x27;s population statistics are very different from the real state of affairs. According to him, &quot;25,000 to 35,000 people&quot; allegedly live in the municipality of the urban district of Vorkuta. The rest, in his opinion, are registered by registration but have already moved to the regions of Russia south of the Arctic Circle. One way or another, Vorkuta is the leading city in the Komi Republic and Russia in terms of population reduction.

==Notable people==
* Pavel Kulizhnikov, Multiple gold medalist in World and European championship speed skating, The youngest speed skater to win and world record holder for fastest 500m speed.
* Nikolay Punin, Husband of poet Anna Akhmatova. Art scholar, writer and editor of Russian magazine publications. Co-founder of Department of Iconography in the State Russian Museum. 
* Andrei Nikolishin, National Hockey League player
* Bella Ratchinskaia, ballet choreographer

==Miscellaneous==

One of the largest coal mine disasters in Russia occurred at Vorkuta coal mine on 28 February 2016, when leaking methane gas ignited and killed 32 people, including 26 trapped miners who had been stranded by a similar explosion three days earlier that had killed four miners.

In 2021, Moscow-based photographer Maria Passer photographed abandoned scenes in Vorkuta as part of a photography project that also included the villages of Cementozavodsky and Severny.

<text>Joëlle Choupay-Mogensen (February 3, 1953 – May 15, 1982) was a singer of French songs. Between 1972 and 1979, she was the lead vocals of [[Il était une fois (band)|Il était une fois]] releasing 8 albums.

==Beginning career==
Born in Long Island, New York, Joëlle was the daughter of a French/Vietnamese/American mother and a Danish father who was serving with UNICEF at the United Nations in New York City. The family eventually returned to Copenhagen in the early part of the 1960s where she attended a private religious school. She spoke six languages and was a member of the volleyball team. She began singing at a young age and as a fan of Bob Dylan, developed a folk song repertoire, appearing on American and Danish television variety shows, playing a guitar and singing.

In 1969 she went to live in the south of France with her mother and sisters where she met guitarist Serge Koolenn. Mogensen studied music at a school in Marseille and began her career singing folk music in cafés and small clubs. By 1971, she and Koolenn had begun a relationship and together recorded a 45rpm.

==In Il était une fois==

After meeting Richard Dewitte, they soon organized a musical ensemble of five males with Joëlle as lead singer. Naming the group &quot;Il était une fois&quot; (literally meaning &quot;Once upon a time&quot; in English). The band continued between 1972 and 1979 produced eight albums.

The band was very popular and appeared frequently on French television variety shows with other performers of the time such as Johnny Hallyday and fellow American-born French singer, Joe Dassin. The albums released were the self-titled &quot;Il était une fois&quot; in 1972, &quot;Ils vécurent heureux&quot; in 1974, &quot;Tourne la page&quot; in 1977 and &quot;Pomme&quot; in 1978. The single &quot;J&#x27;ai encore rêvé d&#x27;elle&quot; released in 1975 remains their most successful hit.

In 1978 the group broke up after she separated from Serge Koolenn.

==Solo career==
After the break-up of Il était une fois, Joëlle signed with Barclay Records. An admirer of the French singer Jean Sablon, she sang with him and dedicated her 1979 &quot;Numéro un&quot; to him. As a solo artist, she released her only album, &quot;Joëlle tout court&quot;, in 1980. This provided the song &quot;Homme impossible&quot; that became a best-selling single on the European music charts in 1981.

Joëlle Mogensen was also a member of &quot;L&#x27;équipe à Jojo&quot; with Joe Dassin, Carlos, Dave and Jeane Manson.

==Death==
On May 14, 1982 Joëlle visited her sisters in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Île-de-France, France, then had dinner with friends with whom she spent the night. In the morning, the 29-year-old singer was found dead. An autopsy determined that the cause of death was a pulmonary edema.

Joëlle Mogensen was interred in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris. Her &quot;Aime-moi&quot; was released three days after her death.

<doc id="481738" wikidata="Q330824" url="?curid=481738" title="Jean Sablon">
<text>Jean Sablon (Nogent-sur-Marne 25 March 1906 – Cannes 24 February 1994) was a French singer, songwriter, composer and actor. He was one of the first French singers to immerse himself in jazz. The man behind several songs by big French and American names, he was the first to use a microphone on a French stage in 1936. Star of vinyl records and the radio, he left France in 1937 to take a contract with NBC in the United States. His radio and later televised shows made him a huge star in America. Henceforth the most international of French singers among his contemporaries, he became an ambassador of French songwriting and dedicated his career to touring internationally, occasionally returning to France to appear on stage. His sixty-one year career came to an end in 1984.

== Biography ==
Sablon was born in Nogent-sur-Marne, the son of a composer, with brothers and sisters who had successful careers of their own in musical entertainment.

A pupil at the Lycée Charlemagne in Paris, Jean Sablon dropped out, intending to study at the Conservatory of Paris. Too late, however, to apply for his year, he concentrated immediately on a professional singing career. He made his debut at the age of seventeen in an operetta in Paris. It was in operettas that he came to share the stage in 1923 first with Jean Gabin in &quot;La Dame en Décolleté&quot; and then with Charles Boyer and Falconetti in &quot;Simili&quot; in 1925.

1927 found him appearing in the review of &quot;Au Temps de Gastounet&quot; (written by Rip) with Jacqueline Delubac. It was Paul Colin who created the first billboard for the young singer. After appearing in the operetta &quot;Lulu&quot; with Fernand Gravey, he embarked on a transatlantic journey to Rio de Janeiro in the company of Georges Milton and Alice Cocéa for the inauguration of the Copacabana Palace (1928). In 1929, Jean Sablon recorded his first demo record for Columbia with Georges Van Parys, as well as sharing the stage in the operetta &quot;Vive Leroy&quot; with Arletty, Dranem and Jacqueline Delubac and then &quot;Music Hall&quot; with Damia and Germaine Rouer. The following year, he appeared in &quot;Cocktail 328&quot; with Damia again, as well as making his first film, &quot;Chacun sa Chance&quot;, the same year, with Jean Gabin who also made his film debut with him.

Henri Diamant-Berger approached Sablon in 1931 for the making of Tante Aurélie alongside his sister Germaine Sablon. That year, he was back on stage in La Revue Argentine, then Parade de Femmes with Carlos Gardel. It was in 1931 that he met Mireille, whose song became a great success, the introduction being made by the editor Raoul Breton.

In another important encounter in 1931, Jean discovered the guitarist Django Reinhardt in &quot;La Boîte à Matelots&quot;.

On stage, Jean appeared with Mistinguett at the Casino de Paris in &quot;Paris qui brille&quot;.

1932 was a year rich in recordings for the record company Columbia. He was accompanied by Don Barretto, sang with his sister Germaine and was accompanied by the pianist and composer Mireille while interpreting songs from the operetta &quot;Un Mois de Vacances&quot;. At the same time, Mireille and Jean Nohain wrote . That song, first performed by Pills et Tabet became a huge hit for them and later for Jean Sablon. In 1933, Jean was reunited with Reda Caire in the operetta &quot;19 ans&quot;, accompanied by Django Reinhardt, with whom he shared success in the recording studio at Columbia, who had initially been reluctant to take the costly risk of engaging Reinhardt who, as a guitarist, couldn&#x27;t read music. Sablon thus became the first singer to have recorded with Django. He then embarked on another journey to America, Hollywood this time, with Mireille at the invitation of Ramon Novarro, famous for Ben Hur on the big screen. In Los Angeles, he gave a concert in front of a panoply of stars. Back in Paris, he created &quot;Ce Petit Chemin&quot;.

It was in 1934 that Jean Cocteau encouraged Sablon to initiate a (one man show), accompanied on the piano by Jean Wiener and Clément Doucet, at the Rococo, an establishment that belonged to Louis Moysès, founder and owner of the cabaret . The London cabaret Monseigneur invited him to perform there. His success on the BBC radio with his trio (Django Reinhardt, André Ekyan and Alec Siniavine) was so considerable that the transmissions were often repeated and the programs of the radio station modified. Back in France, he appeared on the stage in Nice with Django Reinhardt and Joséphine Baker. He was also instrumental in the reopening of the venue and gave recitals at the Rex and the in . In 1935, he created the song &quot;These Foolish Things&quot; at and was on the stage with Pierre Dac in .

In 1936, the film reunited Sablon with Mireille. Their interpretation of represented of sorts a preview of what was to come in video clips decades later. Sablon became the presenter of the radio show &quot;Cadum Variétés&quot;, on which he also sang. Guests included Maurice Chevalier, Damia, Fernandel, Mistinguett, Yvette Guilbert, Albert Préjean, Henri Garat to name a few. He was also given a radio show, &quot;The Magic Key&quot;. He then found himself at the in London, returning to France for at the . It was at the and then at Bobino that he created a scandal by using a microphone, the first to do so in France. It became Sablon&#x27;s kind of brand image.

In 1937, he won the for the song , created by him and written for him by Charles Trenet, Johnny Hess and Paul Misraki. That same year, contracted by the producers of The Magic Key, thanks to his success in France, he left for New York, engaged at the NBC studios of Radio City Hall. It was there that he made a few recordings in English, with celebrities such as Cole Porter and George Gershwin lending him their material, respectively &quot;In the Still of the Night&quot; and &quot;Love walked In&quot;.

In Hollywood, Sablon was contracted to star in &quot;The Story of Irene and Vernon Castle&quot; with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Due to production disagreements, he demanded the withdrawal of scenes in which he starred. The final version conserves merely his interpretation of the song &quot;Darktown Strutters Ball&quot;. In the movie capital, he appeared at the Trocadero. He also presented and sang his songs on the radio show Hollywood Hotel on which he invited numerous big stars. In January 1939, he was in Montreal, creating a swing version of which would go on to have a huge success. It was there that he met La Bolduc, whose technique of as well as her earthy songs impressed him greatly. It was thanks to Sablon that Charles Trenet and La Bolduc were introduced. In the 1940s, he animated the &quot;Show Jean Sablon&quot; on the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) radio and was accompanied by the American accordionist and songwriter John Serry Sr, with Toots Camarata as musical arranger. He returned to Paris to appear on the stage of the ABC and took part to television experiments. Then he returned to New York, his hometown since 1937. He was a star on Broadway and then Boston in the musical &quot;Streets of Paris&quot;. The producer teamed him with Carmen Miranda, who appeared for the first time outside of Brazil. He in turn starred in Brazil on shows at the Casino Atlantico in Rio de Janeiro and Casino Urca.

Sablon made his debut at the Teatro Municipal in São Paulo in 1940, and then in Argentina, Uruguay and Chile. In 1941, he had further engagements in New York, at the Waldorf Astoria, the Plaza and at the San Regis hotels, before going on, in 1942, in Los Angeles and in Cuba, and then touring in America, Brazil and Argentina. Some of his appearances were at the profit of war victims.

Meanwhile, in 1943, in London, his sister Germaine was the first to perform , which became the anthem of the French Resistance. That year, Sablon continued to sing in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, appearing there through 1945, when he returned to the US to perform in New York, Chicago and Washington. The following year found him again in New York, as well as in Hollywood, Boston, Brussels (ABC), Paris (ABC), Mexico (Ciro&#x27;s) and Canada. A further US tour in 1947-48 took him to New Orleans, San Francisco, Hollywood (Ciro&#x27;s), Boston, Los Angeles (Beverly Hills) and Palm Beach, and then onto Brazil, Argentina and Canada.

Sablon&#x27;s recording of in the summer of 1947 in New York (RCA Victor 855332) is the earliest version of this classic, known as &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; in the US. In 1948 he followed and equaled the box office receipts of Danny Kaye at the London Palladium. In France, Jacqueline François received the award for the for , the French version of &quot;It Might As Well Be Spring&quot; written by Sablon.

Thereafter, one international success followed another. In 1949 in New York, then Holland, Switzerland, France and the UK. In 1950, he appeared again in Switzerland (Gstaad) and the UK. It was in London that he recorded on 30 March with the orchestra of Woolf Philips, and on 23 November he recorded the English version with lyrics by Jerry Seleen in Buenos Aires, with the orchestra of Emile Stern. In the intervening months he appeared again in Holland and Brazil, concluding his South American tour in Uruguay and Chile. He was cheered at the , where Gene Kelly unsuccessfully attempted to persuade him to play the role of Henri Baurel in An American in Paris (subsequently taken by Georges Guetary).

Throughout the 1950s, Sablon traveled constantly (except for a year&#x27;s sabbatical in 1957). He appeared repeatedly in the US, the UK, France and Brazil, as well as in Canada, Portugal, Morocco, Algeria, Greece, Italy and Egypt, and Mexico, Cuba and Spain. In 1952, he starred in the film Paris Chante toujours, and the same year became the first French entertainer to be featured in his own show in Las Vegas. Under the banner of the Moss Empire, Sablon toured the UK and Ireland. Later in the decade he extended his travels to include India, Australia and New Zealand, Tahiti, Panama and Venezuela.

With the increasing popularity of television, Sablon was able to reduce his travels while at the same time reaching a larger new audience on both sides of the Atlantic. Nonetheless, he managed to maintain a tight schedule of international appearances throughout the 1960s, attracting enthusiastic crowds not only in Europe, South America and the US, but in South Africa, Bermuda, New Caledonia, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan (where he spent three months) and Iran (where he appeared before the Shah at the royal palace).

Towards the end of the 1960s, Sablon resolved to limit his overseas travels and settled into his house at Theoule-sur-Mer on the Côte d&#x27;Azur. He was engaged at the Paris Cabaret Don Camillo which became one of the first colored transmissions on TV. In 1971, he was asked by Pierre Granier-Deferre to record &quot;Le Temps des Souvenirs&quot; for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Le Chat&quot;. The 1970s and the 1980s found Sablon performing regularly on TV, not only in France, but in Switzerland, Italy, Brazil and the US. In addition, he regularly offered his services on behalf of charitable causes: The Red Cross Gala in Monaco in 1972, the gala for the restoration of Versailles in 1973 and the International Festival of Song first in Brazil and then in Uruguay.

At the urging of US impresario George Wein and singer-pianist Bobby Short, Jean celebrated his 75th birthday at the Met (Lincoln Center) in New York, appearing with the orchestra of Frank Sinatra, thus making his farewell to his American followers. His &quot;Adieux&quot; in Paris in 1982 were televised in prime time from the Pavillon Gabriel (the former Alcazar d&#x27;Eté) and he made his last performance in Rio de Janeiro at the Copacabana Palace in 1984.

Jean Sablon became the most widely acclaimed male French singer of his generation in the world, considered second only in overall lifetime popularity to Maurice Chevalier, a senior model for him. His records sold in the millions around the world and he is frequently referred to as the French equivalent of America&#x27;s Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra. During his career, he recorded with some of the world&#x27;s top musicians, including Django Reinhardt and Stéphane Grappelli.

Sablon appeared in a number of motion pictures and television films performing as a vocalist or pianist, his last being in 1984 when he sang &quot;April in Paris&quot; in &quot;Mistral&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, the popular American TV miniseries filmed in France.

Jean Sablon died in Cannes in 1994 and was buried in the in Paris.

<text>Mireille Hartuch (30 September 1906 – 29 December 1996) was a French singer, composer, and actress. She was generally known by the stage name &quot;Mireille,&quot; it being a common practice of the time to use a single name for the stage.

==Biography==
Mireille was born in Paris to Jewish immigrant parents. Her father, Henri (Hendel) Hartuch came from Poland, and her mother, Mathilda Rubinstein, from Britain. Early on, Mireille was taught to play the piano and encouraged to pursue a theatrical and musical career by her mother, herself the child of a musical family. At the age of six she appeared in her first film in a walk-on role, for which she traveled to Britain. As a teenager she worked in theater and began composing music influenced by the great dance halls of Paris. In 1928 she began a collaboration with lyricist Jean Nohain (1900–1981) that led to considerable success for many years.

Fluent in English, she spent two years in the United States, first in New York City where she performed on Broadway, then in Hollywood, where she appeared in films. In 1931, she appeared in L&#x27;aviateur with Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Buster se marie with Buster Keaton. Meanwhile in France, contemporary stars Maurice Chevalier, Jean Sablon, and Charles Trenet (who credited Mireille with introducing &quot;swing&quot; to France), charted hits with her compositions, launching her songwriting career.

In 1933, she appeared in the French film &quot;Chourinette,&quot; though until 1951, when she appeared in &quot;Au fil des ondes,&quot; her career as a music-hall singer took precedence. In 1937, she married the writer and philosopher Emmanuel Berl. Three years later, the Nazi occupation forced the Jewish couple into hiding in Argentat in the remote Corrèze département of the Limousin region. There, Mireille was very active in the French Resistance and was head of the local liberation committee.

After the War, she befriended Jean Cocteau, Albert Camus, and André Malraux. In the 1950s, her friend, Sacha Guitry gave her the idea of opening the &quot;Petit Conservatoire de la chanson&quot; (Little Conservatory of Song ) to use her talents to train young variety singers. The Petit Conservatoire produced a Sunday radio program beginning in 1955, and a television program from 1960 to 1974, nurturing the voices of a number of young singers who went on to lead successful careers, such as Françoise Hardy, Alain Souchon, Alice Dona, Hervé Cristiani, Yves Duteil, Frida Boccara and Colette Magny.

In her long and celebrated career, Mireille Hartuch composed more than six hundred songs and was twice decorated by the government for her contributions to French culture. She continued performing well into her old age. She lived at 36 rue de Montpensier in the 1st arrondissement of Paris for forty years.

Mireille Hartuch died in Paris in 1996 at the age of 90 and was interred there in the Cimetière du Montparnasse.

<text>John Robert Starr (1927 – 1 April 2000) was an American journalist and newspaper columnist. Starr was noted for his role in the demise of the &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot; during the 1980s and his criticism of President Bill Clinton including popularizing the term &quot;Slick Willie&quot;.

John Robert Starr wrote sports for the &quot;Memphis Commercial Appeal&quot; and founded the &quot;Pine Bluff Star-Reporter&quot; at Pine Bluff, Arkansas before being hired by the Associated Press in 1957. Starr worked for the AP for nineteen years, which included ten years as the Little Rock bureau chief.

Starr served as bureau chief during the controversial period under Governor Orval Faubus and was responsible for reporting the social changes sweeping the state during the late 1950s and early 1960s, including the critical Little Rock Crisis of 1957-58. Starr left the AP in 1976 and taught journalism for two years.

John Robert Starr became managing editor of the &quot;Arkansas Democrat&quot; in 1978. He was hired by publisher Walter E. Hussman Jr., who intended to take on the rival &quot;Arkansas Gazette,&quot; which was the state&#x27;s premier newspaper and the oldest continuously published newspaper west of the Mississippi River.

Soon after his arrival at the &quot;Democrat&quot;, he posed for the &quot;Arkansas Times&quot; May 1979 magazine cover with a helmet on his head and with a knife clenched between his teeth squatting atop a &quot;Gazette &quot;newspaper rack. Hussman seriously considered firing Starr for this unapproved action but in the end, only reprimanded him. Nevertheless, this photo set the tone for the bitter newspaper war that followed and foreshadowed that the battle was &quot;to the death&quot;.

Starr was the field general for the &quot;Democrat&quot; during the 13-year-long newspaper war and wrote scathing commentaries about the &quot;Gazette&quot; on the editorial pages of the &quot;Democrat&quot;. The &quot;Democrat&quot; adopted a free classified ad program and switched from an afternoon to a morning paper in order to compete directly with the &quot;Gazette&quot;. The &quot;Gazette&quot; underwent a long decline and was passed through several owners before being purchased by Hussman in 1991 and folded into the &quot;Democrat&quot; operation to form the &quot;Arkansas Democrat-Gazette&quot;.

Starr played a major role in the passage of the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act which was praised as a model sunshine law at the time of its passage.

Starr stepped down as managing editor in 1992. He continued to write a daily column through the late 1990s when he reduced his output to three days a week. During this time, Starr was very critical of Bill Clinton in his columns. Starr had supported Clinton during his early years as Governor of Arkansas but became very critical after Starr claimed that Clinton had lied to him about a story.

During Clinton&#x27;s election bids, Starr often made appearances on national political programs to comment about his experiences covering Clinton during his Arkansas years. Starr&#x27;s last columns focused on calling for the resignation of Arkansas Razorbacks basketball coach Nolan Richardson.
Later when Starr was in the hospital after heart surgery, Richardson sent him flowers. This completely changed the way Starr wrote about Richardson from then on.

John Robert Starr died of a heart attack while on vacation at Del Norte, Colorado. His son is Robert &quot;Rusty&quot; Starr who is publisher of the &quot;Palatka Daily News&quot; in Palatka, Florida.

&quot;John Robert was as tenacious a friend as he was a foe. In good and bad times alike, I always knew him to speak his mind and say exactly what he felt. That kind of candor can be strong medicine, but I learned to respect him for it. His legion of readers might not always agree with his point of view, but they read what he had to say.&quot; President Bill Clinton released this statement from the White House upon hearing of Starr&#x27;s death in April 2000.

<text>Adolphine Fletcher Terry (1882–1976) was an American political and social activist in the state of Arkansas. Terry leveraged her position within the Little Rock community to affect change in causes related to social justice, women&#x27;s rights, racial equality, housing, and education. Fletcher is most remembered for her role on the Women&#x27;s Emergency Committee to Open Our Schools (WEC) that was primarily responsible for reopening the Little Rock, Arkansas, public school system and bringing to a close the school district closing in 1958, following the Crisis at Little Rock Central High. In its &quot;Millennium Poll&quot; in 2000, the Arkansas Historical Association named Terry one of the state&#x27;s 15 most significant figures in state history.

== Early life and education ==
Terry was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, on November 3, 1882, to a socially and politically prominent family. She was the daughter of John Gould Fletcher (I), an Arkansas native and Confederate officer who became one of the South&#x27;s leading cotton brokers and a prominent bank president. He was elected the first sheriff of Pulaski County and later served as mayor of Little Rock (1875 to 1881); he was unsuccessful in three bids for governor and one for Congress. Terry&#x27;s mother was the former Adolphine Krause, daughter of a Little Rock merchant and a German immigrant. Terry had two younger siblings: Pulitzer Prize-winning poet John Gould Fletcher and suffragist Mary Fletcher Drennan.

Before marrying John Gould Fletcher, Terry&#x27;s mother was compelled to leave school and abandon her pursuit of a career in music to care for her ailing mother and siblings. Because of this experience, Adolphine Krause became highly protective of her own children and encouraged educational achievements. Terry and her siblings were typically overdressed in layers of heavy cotton fabric, even in the heat of summer, and were discouraged from adventurous play for fear they would be injured.

In 1889, the Fletcher family purchased the former home of Albert Pike at 411 7th Street in Little Rock, Arkansas. The Greek Revival style home most recently housed the Arkansas Female College, and the Fletchers made significant improvements to restore it to a family residence. Terry would grow up, marry and live most of the rest of her life in that home, which served as the headquarters for her later activism and became known as the Pike–Fletcher–Terry House.

In her unpublished autobiography, Terry recalled an early &quot;lesson in justice&quot; that influenced her view of race relations. A cousin accused a young black house servant of stealing a diamond ring and demanded his arrest, only to find it hidden in the ruffles of her dress. At a time when such a charge would likely end in mob justice for the accused, the cousin went on with her day without a second thought. Terry, however, realized how the casual accusation imperiled the boy, and she never forgot the incident.

Like many privileged women of her time, Terry entered college at the early age of 15 after graduating Peabody High School in 1898. Following the wishes of her mother, became only the second Arkansan to attend the prestigious Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York. Vassar&#x27;s curriculum engaged Terry with community issues of her time, taught her to think independently and planted a seed for social activism in her life. She also credits the influence of classmate Lucy Burns—who would go on to become one of the key figures to win passage of the 19th Amendment—for imparting a different view of race than she learned from her Southern upbringing. Terry graduated in 1902 and returned to Arkansas &quot;... ready to change the world and she kept trying until her dying day to do it,&quot; according to her friend Judge Edwin Dunaway.

== Public life and social activism ==
Shortly after returning from college, Terry involved herself in many local clubs and activities like many other women of her time. Terry wasn&#x27;t satisfied with just attending parties and appearing as a debutante. As a southern new woman, Terry felt the desire to join clubs and involve herself in the needs of her community. Throughout her life that need permeated her everyday and Terry became a champion for causes both small and large, and she used her position to help others less fortunate than herself.

=== Education ===
In 1905 Terry was responsible for co-founding the Southern Association for College Women which provided a forum for college educated women to discuss issues that were important to them. This organization would later become the Arkansas Association for University Women a division of the American Association of University Women. She also helped with education reform, pushing for school consolidation throughout the state of Arkansas. She was an advocate of hiring professional school administrators and formed the first school improvement association in the state. Terry maintained an interest in education throughout her life and led efforts to consolidate school districts and provide transportation for rural students.

=== Juveniles in Arkansas ===
In 1911 Terry was appointed by the local Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union to investigate juvenile courts that had been established by legislation the group had championed. She was soon appointed the chairman of the juvenile court board for Pulaski County. She and other members of the board even took delinquent children into their own homes to keep them out of the state reform school that had been largely deemed a &quot;place of punishment for bad children.&quot; Terry and other members of the board fought for the creation of the Boys Industrial School and the Girls Industrial School in 1917.

Terry also helped to form the African-American branch of the Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association (YWCA) in Little Rock. Her assistance in this feat led to the YWCA opening in 1921.

=== Women&#x27;s suffrage movement ===
In addition to her expanded views on race, Terry had a direct connection with the suffrage movement, in part, through her friendship with Vassar classmate Lucy Burns. As early as 1910, there is evidence of her involvement in a letter she wrote to Senator James P. Clarke to request an audience with &quot;the representatives of the equal suffrage society&quot; on their visit to Washington, D.C. Terry&#x27;s sister Mary created the Political Equality League in 1911, kicking off a new wave of support for women&#x27;s suffrage in the state. Both sisters were active in the organization, which sponsored educational efforts and lobbied for legislative changes pertaining to women&#x27;s suffrage. The organization brought measures before the General Assembly in four separate sessions before they were able to persuade the legislature to grant women the right to vote in the state&#x27;s primary elections in 1917.

Terry was a leader at both the state and national level in the campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage. in January 1916 Terry presided over a Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage conference that convened at the Marion Hotel in Little Rock. CU founder Alice Paul spoke at the convention to garner support for an Arkansas chapter. The organization voted Terry to serve on the national advisory board of the CU and ex-officio member of the Arkansas executive committee.

=== Libraries and literacy ===
Terry is very well known for her advocacy for libraries. As a part of the Americanism committee for the state of Arkansas, she made it her mission to improve the libraries in the state. When she began her work, in 1934, there were only three reported libraries in the entire state of Arkansas due to poor state planning and lack of funding. Under her direction, legislation was passed to appropriate local funding statewide for the creation of public libraries. Terry was praised for her work on this project throughout her life. She served as a trustee of the Little Rock Public Library for 40 years until her retirement in 1966.

=== Women&#x27;s Emergency Committee ===
In 1958 Terry founded the Women&#x27;s Emergency Committee to Open Our Schools as a critical response to the Little Rock Crisis over school integration. Her leadership of the white women of Little Rock was a major obstacle to the efforts of Governor Orval Faubus to keep the schools from integrating. &quot;In 1959, the WEC, black voters, and a group called Stop This Outrageous Purge campaigned successfully to recall three school board members who were segregationists...The WEC efforts, including a study documenting the negative effect the school crisis was having on Little Rock’s economy, altered the course of public action and helped reopen the schools in 1959.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Adolphine Fletcher Terry and David D. Terry (1881-1963) were married in the Fletcher home on July 7, 1910. The Terrys had four children, David D. Terry Jr. (1911-1962), Mary Terry (1914-1974) born with a rare defect called osteogenesis imperfecta, Sally Terry (1916-1986), and William (Bill) Terry (1922-2016). The Terrys also cared for David, Sr.&#x27;s sister after the death of his parents, as well as adopted Joseph, an orphan that their daughter Mary became friends with while receiving treatment for her illness. Terry took care of her large family throughout World War I and during David, Sr.&#x27;s career while still maintaining her role as an important Little Rock community member.

David Sr. was involved in politics. From 1929-1933 he served on the Little Rock School Board. After completing his tenure on the school board he was elected to the state legislature in 1933. Eventually David would go on to have two successful terms in the United States House of Representatives, but would lose races for both United States Senate and the Arkansas governorship. He died of Parkinson&#x27;s disease on October 6, 1963.

&quot;Terry&#x27;s son William and his wife Betty continue to be active in Little Rock. Their daughters and their families also carry on Adolphine Fletcher Terry’s commitment to making Little Rock better.&quot;

== Later life and legacy ==
Following a severe stroke, Adolphine Fletcher Terry was moved from her childhood home into a long-term care facility where she died on July 25, 1976, at 93. Terry is buried alongside her husband in historic Mount Holly Cemetery in downtown Little Rock. Terry and her sister Mary Fletcher Drennan deeded the Pike–Fletcher–Terry House to the City of Little Rock in 1964 for use by the Arkansas Arts Center. Drennan, who did not live in Arkansas as an adult, surrendered her life estate and turned the title over to the city in 1977. The home opened as the Decorative Arts Museum on March 24, 1985.

On April 27, 1990, the Central Arkansas Library System dedicated its seventh branch as the Adolphine Fletcher Terry Library in West Little Rock. Festivities for the two-day opening included a presentation by author and newspaper editor Harry Ashmore, a performance of &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; by the Arkansas Arts Center&#x27;s Tell-a-Tale Troupe, folk dancing by the Arkansas Country Dance Society and folk music by the Rackensack Society. Construction of the library cost $1.9 million, collected as part of a bond issue passed in 1987. The library opened with 22,000 books and one mile of shelving.

<text>The Women&#x27;s Emergency Committee to Open Our Schools (WEC) was an organization formed by a group of socially prominent white women in the city of Little Rock, Arkansas during the Little Rock Crisis in 1958. The organization advocated for the integration of the Little Rock public school system and was a major obstacle to Governor Orval Faubus&#x27;s efforts to prevent racial integration. The women spoke out in favor of a special election to remove segregationists from the Little Rock school board.

==Background==
After the U.S. Supreme Court issued its &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; ruling on May 17, 1954, segregated schools were ruled to be unconstitutional. The NAACP soon signed up nine high-achieving black students, the Little Rock Nine, for attendance at Little Rock Central High School, a previously all-white school. After the school became the site of demonstrations and protests on September 4, 1957, Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus deployed the Arkansas National Guard to the school to prevent the students from entering, contradicting the Supreme Court and the wishes of the school district. The crisis escalated with Faubus ordering all public schools in the city closed, rather than allowing the integration of the nine students.

==Creation==
In response to the crisis, Adolphine Terry, Vivion Brewer, and Velma Powell formed the Women&#x27;s Emergency Committee to Open Our Schools (WEC). Terry, then a 75-year-old woman, was a Vassar graduate, the widow of Congressman David D. Terry, and highly influential in her community. Brewer, a Smith College graduate, had founded Little Rock&#x27;s orchestra and library, and was the wife of Senator Joe T. Robinson&#x27;s nephew and the daughter of a former Little Rock mayor.

Terry organized the first meeting in her home on September 16, 1958, which was attended by 58 women; it would expand to 1400 by May, the majority of whom were white, wealthy, and educated. This collective wealth insulated them from the economic ramifications of vocal opposition to desegregation faced by pro-integration businessmen and newspapers, and their husbands were not held accountable for the actions of their wives. Nonetheless, the women faced public opposition ranging from harassment, insults, and death threats delivered in phone calls and letters. Though envisioned by its founders as an interracial organization advocating for full integration, membership of the organization feared the position would harm its public support. The group positioned itself as a political group dedicated to re-opening schools, and maintained a primarily white membership.

The WEC was active in encouraging Little Rock voters to vote for integration as a means to end the crisis during a special election ordered by Governor Faubus. The group organized phone trees and car pools for voters, but the first election was a failure for the WEC. The WEC responded by putting public pressure on white men in the community, lobbying business leaders and later publishing &quot;The Little Rock Report&quot; on the economic impact of the crisis. The organization also created a &quot;SEX&quot; committee designed to create a charm offensive to lure male community leaders and businessmen to be more vocal against segregation; the committee once encouraged women to withhold sex from their husbands, though it is unclear how serious the suggestion was.

The WEC was the first white organization to speak out against segregation in Little Rock, hosting a short televised panel among its members and later organizing a televised panel of local ministers.

==Campaigns==

===School board elections===
After the resignation of five school board members, the WEC started a signature campaign to recruit moderate and liberal business leaders to run for the positions. The WEC managed to achieve an evenly-divided school board in the election, though their role in the campaign and their organization of the slate was kept secret to avoid negative associations with the candidates. The deadlocked schoolboard would later force a recall election.

===Promoting economic effects===
In January 1958, the WEC began a newspaper advertisement campaign highlighting the adverse economic effect of the segregation crisis in Little Rock, building off of a strategy recommended by the Virginia Committee for Public Schools. In 1959, the Chamber of Commerce polled its members and found 71 percent supported &quot;a minimal plan of integration&quot; to bring an end to the crisis. In response, segregationists demanded the names of the WEC membership roster under the 1957 Bennett Ordinance, which required organizations to list rosters and financial contributors. To protect its members, the WEC never compiled a formal list, and kept one copy of its mailing list hidden in a different home each night. When only financial documents were submitted to the city&#x27;s Board of Directors, the WEC officers were threatened with arrest, but none of its members were ever arrested.

===School board recall===
During the same period, members of the WEC began actively lobbying the Arkansas General Assembly on a daily basis. By February 1959, Arkansas State Representative T. E. Tyler drafted a bill that would allow Governor Faubus to appoint three temporary members to the Little Rock School Board. WEC members confronted Tyler on the bill, who responded by telling the women to &quot;please shut up&quot; and admitting that the law was &quot;a little on the dictator side&quot;. The bill was eventually defeated.

In May 1959, the Little Rock School Board voted against contract renewals for 45 teachers believed to be supportive of federal integration efforts, despite lacking a quorum after moderate members of the board walked out of the meeting. That action pushed the WEC to launch a door-to-door recall effort for the remaining school board members, including editorial writing and voter registration and mobilization. With multiple groups voicing opposition to the board&#x27;s action, including the League of Women Voters, the Chamber of Commerce, the Little Rock Parent-Teacher Association, and the Little Rock Ministerial Alliance, a new organization, &quot;Stop This Outrageous Purge&quot; (STOP), was formed by Edward Lester, Maurice Mitchell, Robert Shults, and Gene Fritz. Though STOP would avoid public association with the WEC, Lester, Mitchell and Shults were married to WEC members; in later interviews many would give credit to the WEC for the success of STOP. The WEC became the workforce for STOP&#x27;s strategic plans, gathering 9,000 signatures supporting a recall of segregationist school board members, circulating handbills, and mobilizing voters based on experiences in past campaigns.

The campaign resulted in a recall of the segregationist school board members and elected three new moderates, all credited to the STOP campaign. On August 12, 1959, Little Rock&#x27;s public high schools re-opened with black students in every school.

==Aftermath==
Members of the WEC continued to work for education issues and to support campaigns of moderate integrationists in the South, offering advisory roles for similar organizations in Atlanta and New Orleans. However, with a lack of specific goals, the group eventually voted to disband in 1963. In 2015, the organization was honored in the inaugural group of women and organizations inducted into the Arkansas Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

<doc id="481745" wikidata="Q1545624" url="?curid=481745" title="Davy Jones's locker">
<text>Davy Jones&#x27; locker is a metaphor for the oceanic abyss, the final resting place of drowned sailors and travellers. It is a euphemism for drowning or shipwrecks in which the sailors&#x27; and ships&#x27; remains are consigned to the depths of the ocean (to be &quot;sent to Davy Jones&#x27; Locker&quot;).

The origins of the name of Davy Jones, the sailors&#x27; devil, are unclear, with a 19th-century dictionary tracing Davy Jones to a &quot;ghost of Jonah&quot;. Other explanations of this nautical superstition have been put forth, including an incompetent sailor or a pub owner who kidnapped sailors.

==History==
The earliest known reference of the negative connotation of Davy Jones occurs in &quot;The Four Years Voyages of Capt. George Roberts&quot;, attributed to Daniel Defoe, published in 1726 in London.

And elsewhere in &quot;The Four Years Voyages&quot;:

An early description of Davy Jones occurs in Tobias Smollett&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle&quot;, published in 1751:

In the story, Jones is described as having saucer eyes, three rows of teeth, horns, a tail, and blue smoke coming from his nostrils.

===Proposed origins of the tale===
The origin of the tale of Davy Jones is unclear, and many conjectural or folkloric explanations have been told:

*&quot;The Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue&quot; by Francis Grose, written in 1785 and published in 1811, includes the definitions: &quot;DAVID JONES. The devil, the spirit of the sea: called Necken or Draugr in the north countries, such as Norway, Denmark, and Sweden&quot; and &quot;DAVID JONES&#x27; LOCKER. The sea&quot;.
*Written within a foreign affairs segment within the newspaper &#x27;Chester Chronicle&#x27; in 1791, the term &#x27;Safe in Davy Jones&#x27;s locker&#x27; was used to convey that a person was lost, therefore to be within Davy Jones&#x27;s locker was to be lost at sea.
*The 1898 &quot;Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&quot; connects Davy to the West-Indian &quot;duppy&quot; (&quot;duffy&quot;) and Jones to biblical Jonah: The reference to &quot;duppy/duffy&quot; was deleted in later revisions of Brewer&#x27;s dictionary.
*David Jones, a real pirate, although not a very well-known one, living on the Indian Ocean in the 1630s.
* Duffer Jones, a notoriously myopic sailor who often found himself overboard.
*A British pub owner who supposedly threw drunken sailors into his ale locker and then gave them to be drafted on any ship.
*Linguists consider it most plausible that &quot;Davy&quot; was inspired by Saint David of Wales, whose name was often invoked by Welsh sailors, and &quot;Jones&quot; by the Biblical Jonah.

==Reputation==

Not all traditions dealing with Davy Jones are fearful. In traditions associated with sailors crossing the Equatorial line, there is a &quot;raucous and rowdy&quot; initiation presided over by those who have crossed the line before, known as shellbacks, or Sons of Neptune. The eldest shellback is called King Neptune, and Davy Jones is to be re-enacted as his first assistant.

==Use in media==
===19th century===
in 1812, a musical pantomime &#x27;Davy Jones&#x27;s Locker, Or Black ey&#x27;d Susan&#x27; was performed at London&#x27;s West End theatre; Sans Pareil, known today as Adelphi Theatre.

===20th century===
In the 1930 cartoon &quot;The Haunted Ship&quot;, from the &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; series, Davy Jones is depicted as a living skeleton wearing a pirate&#x27;s bicorne hat.

Raymond Z. Gallun&#x27;s 1935 science fiction story &quot;Davey Jones&#x27; Ambassador&quot; tells of a deep-sea explorer in his underwater capsule who comes in contact on the seabed with a deep-sea culture of underwater creatures.

Theodore Sturgeon&#x27;s 1938 short story &quot;Mailed Through a Porthole&quot;, about a doomed freighter, takes the form of a letter addressed to &quot;Mr. David Jones, Esq., Forty Fathoms.&quot;

Davy Jones is a character appearing in &quot;Popeye&quot; comics authored by Tom Sims and Bela Zaboly between 1939 and 1959. He is depicted as a sea spirit who inhabits the bottom of the ocean as well as his Locker, which is located in a sunken ship.

Tom Lehrer&#x27;s 1953 album Songs by Tom Lehrer includes the number &quot;The Irish Ballad,&quot; in which one of the stanzas contains the lines &quot;She weighted her brother down with stones / And sent him off to Davey Jones.&quot;

The 1959 Broadway musical &quot;Davy Jones&#x27; Locker&quot; with Bil Baird&#x27;s marionettes had a two-week run at the Morosco Theatre.

In the television series &quot;The Monkees&quot; 1967 episode &quot;Hitting The High Seas&quot;, the character Davy Jones (played by musician Davy Jones) receives special treatment while kidnapped in a ship as he claims to be related to &quot;The Original&quot; Davy Jones, his grandfather. The fact that Jones the musician shared a name with the legendary seafarer has itself led to a number of puns swapping the two in the decades that followed.

===21st century===
The concept of Davy Jones was combined with the legend of the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; in the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; film series, in which Davy Jones&#x27;s locker is portrayed as a purgatory place of punishment for those who crossed Davy Jones. Jones is portrayed as a captain assigned to ferry those drowned at sea to the afterlife before he corrupted his purpose out of anger at his betrayal by his lover, the sea-goddess Calypso. Davy Jones is portrayed as an enigma of the sea, featuring octopus tentacles for a beard and crab claw for a hand.

The phrase has often been referenced comedically in the animated television series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, particularly by the show&#x27;s ghostly personification of the Flying Dutchman. &quot;Davy Jones&#x27;s locker&quot; has made occasional appearances in the cartoon as a literal gym locker used to contain souls and socks. One episode features Davy Jones from The Monkees claim ownership of the locker, as a pun on the pop singer&#x27;s name.

French singer Nolwenn Leroy recorded a song titled &quot;Davy Jones&quot; for her 2012 album &quot;Ô Filles de l&#x27;Eau&quot;. The English version contains the lines: &quot;Davy Jones, oh Davy Jones / Where they gonna rest your bones / Down in the deep blue sea / Down in the deep blue sea...&quot;

In 2022 it was widely reported as referenced and explained by Mrs Justice Steyn to Rebekah Vardy in the Wagatha Christie trial.

<text>Cimetière parisien de Bagneux is one of the three Parisien cemeteries &quot;extra muros&quot;, located in Bagneux. The cemetery has a large Jewish section (many of the divisions have exclusively Jewish graves) and is sometimes known as the &quot;Jewish cemetery&quot;.

==History==
Before the site became a cemetery, it was the scene of heavy fighting in May 1871, in the war between the Versailles and the Fédérés.

The cemetery was opened on 15 November 1886 and is one of the three Parisien Cemeteries &quot;extra muros&quot;, the others being Cimetière Parisien de Thiais (opened in 1929) and Cimetière Parisien de Pantin. It was opened at the same time as Pantin, (which is northeast of Paris). Both have similar entrances. Bagneux is the smallest of the three cemeteries serving Paris, but the most active.

==Notes==
The cemetery is still open and there are about 10 burials a day. The cemetery is divided into 115 divisions. It is estimated that there are around 83,000 graves.

The cemetery was the burial place of Oscar Wilde until his remains were moved to Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Similarly, Jeanne Hébuterne, the model and artist who was Amedeo Modigliani&#x27;s lover and mother of his only child, was originally buried here. Despondent over his death, Jeanne Hébuterne committed suicide and her family interred her at Cimetière de Bagneux until finally relenting and allowing her remains to be transferred to the Père Lachaise Cemetery in 1930 to rest beside Modigliani.

There are nearly 5,500 trees (about 20 different species). It is home to many birds (35 different species have already been counted) and squirrels.

==Notable burials==
===Monuments===
There are monuments for:
* Jews who died in the Second World War (division 1)
* The Warsaw Ghetto (division 115)
* The victims of concentration camps and those who died as a result of &quot;Nazi barbarism&quot;. There are many of these monuments in the Jewish divisions.

===Military graves===
The cemetery has a number of military sections.

There are two divisions dedicated to the French Military who died in the First and Second World War.

Division 19 contains two sections dedicated to British Commonwealth dead and which are maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. These plots contain around 35 Commonwealth service war graves of the First World War (mostly British soldiers who died in 1914), and a few from the Second. A notable example was John Wilson (1889–1914), who was a peacetime Scottish professional footballer and died of wounds.

<text>Jean Dasté (born Jean Georges Gustave Dasté; 18 September 1904 – 15 October 1994) was a French actor and theatre director.

Although Jean Dasté is best known for his career on stage as both an actor and director in a variety of works including those by Shakespeare and Molière, he made his first appearance on screen in a 1932 Jean Renoir film (&quot;Boudu sauvé des eaux&quot;), and 57 years later appeared in his final film at the age of 85. He played also the main character in two Jean Vigo movies, &quot;L&#x27;Atalante&quot; and &quot;Zéro de conduite&quot;. Later, he worked also with Alain Resnais and François Truffaut.

==Personal life==
He married Danish-born actress Marie-Hélène Copeau (1902–1994), the daughter of the influential French writer, editor, and drama critic Jacques Copeau (1879–1949) and Agnès Thomsen. In 1947, he became the founding director of the Comedie de St.-Etienne stage company in the town of Saint-Étienne in the Loire department. A college and a theatre in the town are named in his honour.

<text>John Hanks Alexander (January 6, 1864 – March 26, 1894) was the first African-American officer in the United States armed forces to hold a regular command position and the second African-American graduate of the United States Military Academy (after Henry Ossian Flipper).

==Early life==
John Hanks Alexander was born on January 6, 1864, at Helena, Arkansas, the fourth of seven children born to former slaves James Milo Alexander and Fannie Miller Alexander. James Alexander was a barber and dry goods salesman in Helena and acquired property there. He later became the first black Justice of the Peace in Arkansas and represented Phillips County in the Arkansas House of Representatives. He died in 1871. All of the Alexander children graduated from high school and three attended Oberlin College in Ohio.

Alexander graduated number one in his high school class in Helena and soon moved to Carrollton, Mississippi, to take a position as a teacher. In late 1880 he visited his uncle in Cincinnati, Ohio, and ended up remaining in that city. The next year, he enrolled at Oberlin College and attended that institution until passing the entrance examination for West Point in 1883. Alexander was sponsored by Democratic U.S. Rep. George W. Geddes of Ohio.

==Military career==

Alexander&#x27;s experience at West Point is disputed. Some accounts suggest Alexander was generally accepted by the other cadets and was not subjected to as much intolerance as previous black cadets. Adjutant Eli Hoyle described Alexander as &quot;a splendid scholar, getting along finely&quot;. Other accounts suggest he spent his early years at the academy in &quot;social isolation&quot;, where he suffered from racial slurs and exclusion from extracurricular activities. At West Point, he was not allowed to room with white cadets, and would routinely be ignored while attending Sunday Chapel.

All accounts indicate that Alexander was known as an excellent student, especially in mathematics and languages and was a skilled boxer while at the academy. He distinguished himself as a skilled rider when performing in the cavalry drill. He graduated in the class of 1887 ranking 32nd in a class of 64.

Alexander was assigned to the 9th US Cavalry Regiment at Fort Robinson, Nebraska, which was an all-black regiment commanded by white officers and nicknamed Buffalo soldiers. In 1888, he was transferred to Fort Washakie, Wyoming, where he performed the garrison duty typical of an officer with a western frontier posting. While assigned to Fort Duchesne, Utah, in 1889, Alexander temporarily led the 9th Cavalry&#x27;s B Troop, becoming the first black officer in the Army to hold a command position.

In February 1894, Alexander was sent to Wilberforce University, an all-black institution, as a professor of military science and tactics. Shortly after arriving, he died unexpectedly of a ruptured aorta on March 26, 1894. John Hanks Alexander was buried with military honors in Xenia, Ohio

==Legacy==
A military installation at Newport News, Virginia, was named Camp Alexander in honor of John Alexander.

<doc id="481751" wikidata="Q664816" url="?curid=481751" title="Dale Alford">
<text>Thomas Dale Alford Sr. (January 28, 1916 – January 25, 2000) was an American ophthalmologist and politician from the U.S. state of Arkansas who served as a conservative Democrat in the United States House of Representatives from Little Rock from 1959 to 1963.

==Early years and education==
Alford was born to Thomas H. Alford and the former Ida Womack in the small community of Newhope near Murfreesboro in Pike County in southwestern Arkansas. He attended public schools at Rector in Clay County in far northeastern Arkansas. He graduated from high school in 1932, a year ahead of schedule.

Alford first attended Arkansas State College in Jonesboro in eastern Arkansas, followed by the Arkansas State Teachers College in Conway, and received his medical degree in 1939 from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences at Little Rock.

==Military service and medical practice==
Alford served as a captain during World War II in the United States Army Medical Corps from 1940 to 1946. He was on active duty as a surgeon in the European Theater of operations. Afterwards, from 1947 to 1948, he was an assistant professor at Methodist-affiliated Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia.

==Elections to Congress, 1958 and 1960==
Alford was elected as a write-in candidate in the 1958 general election that occurred in the aftermath of the Little Rock Crisis. He was only the second write-in candidate ever to have been elected to the House. (The Republican Joe Skeen was thereafter elected to the House from New Mexico as a write-in candidate in 1980.) Alford jumped into the election against incumbent U.S. Representative Brooks Hays who had endorsed the integration of Little Rock Central High School. Alford supporters printed thousands of stickers with his name on them and handed them out at polling places. Hays maintained a lead during the counting until an extra twenty boxes arrived bearing ballots with Alford stickers. Ultimately, Alford prevailed, 30,739 (51 percent) to Hays&#x27; 29,483 (49 percent).

Osro Cobb, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, recalled that:
There were loud protests and allegations of irregularities and fraud from Hays supporters. Because it was a federal election, I had a grand jury impaneled, and an order was obtained from the U.S. District Court that impounded all of the ballots cast for review by the grand jury. When the grand jury completed its minute review of all the votes cast, it was established that the count had been unusually accurate for each candidate [Alford and Hays], and the grand jury was so outraged by the allegations made and the lack of evidence to support them that it seriously considered indicting those who had made the accusations. I was surprised by Hays&#x27; defeat because I did not realize the extent and commitment of the majority of the voters in the Fifth Congressional District to separate-but-equal schools in lieu of integration, which they feared would destroy their schools.

In 1960, Alford won his second term in the House with 57,617 votes (82.7 percent) to Republican L. J. Churchill (1902–1987) of Dover in Pope County in northwestern Arkansas, who received 12,054 ballots (17.3 percent). Churchill was a highly regarded civic and political figure in Dover. A Cumberland Presbyterian and a Mason, Churchill served as mayor of Dover and on the municipal school board, both nonpartisan positions. He had been state chairman of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture. He operated L.J. Churchill&#x27;s General Merchandise Store and was a member of the board of directors of the Bank of Dover.

==Two gubernatorial races==
Alford&#x27;s Little Rock-based district was merged with Arkansas&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, represented by the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Wilbur D. Mills, after the 1960 census revealed that Arkansas had grown at less than the national average during the 1950s. Rather than face certain defeat in the 1962 Democratic primary against Mills, at the time an icon in Arkansas politics, Alford instead chose to enter the primary against incumbent Governor Orval Faubus. In an active campaign, Faubus polled a narrow majority over Alford, former Governor Sidney Sanders McMath, Vernon H. Whitten, and two other candidates. Faubus received 208,996 ballots (51.6 percent) to McMath&#x27;s 83,437 (20.6 percent), Alford&#x27;s 82,815 (20.4 percent), and Whitten&#x27;s 22,377 (5.5 percent). Faubus then prevailed with ease over the Republican nominee, Fayetteville pharmacist Willis Ricketts.

Alford ran for governor again in 1966 and finished fourth with 53,531 votes (12.7 percent). He received fewer voters than his old nemesis Brooks Hays, who with 64,814 (15.4 percent) finished third in the primary balloting. The runoff positions went to former Arkansas Supreme Court Justices James D. Johnson, a segregationist, and Frank Holt. Johnson narrowly defeated Holt in the Democratic runoff but then lost to Republican Winthrop Rockefeller in the general election. In 1984, Alford entered the Democratic primary election for Congress in Central Arkansas&#x27;s Second District for the open seat being vacated by Republican Ed Bethune. Appearing to many voters as a throwback to another era, Alford ran a distant fifth in a race ultimately won by Pulaski County Sheriff Tommy Robinson. Alford, was far outpolled by African-American Thedford Collins, a Little Rock banker and former aide to U.S. Senator David Pryor.

==Alford&#x27;s death==
Alford died in Little Rock of congestive heart failure on January 25, 2000, three days shy of his eighty-third birthday.

<text>Charles Garnier, (; baptised in Paris, May 25, 1606 – martyred December 7, 1649) was a Jesuit missionary working in New France. He was killed by Iroquois in a Petun (Tobacco Nation) village on December 7, 1649.

==Biography==
The son of a secretary to King Henri III of France, Garnier was born in Paris in 1606. He attended the Collège de Clermont in Paris and joined the Jesuit seminary in Clermont in September 1624.

After his novitiate, he returned to the College of Clermont as Prefect. After finishing his studies in rhetoric and philosophy, he spent two years teaching at the College of Eu as a teacher. Completing years of studies in language, culture, and theology, he was ordained as a priest in 1635. Initially fobidden by his father from travelling to Canada, where he would face almost certain death as a missionary, he was eventually allowed to go. Embarking on March 25, 1636, he described the crossing in a letter to his father,

We gave Viaticum to a sailor who had fallen from the top of the mizzenmast to the deck. He was well-disposed to die. However, as I saw him in great discomfort, unable to sleep, I gave him my cabin and went in with Father Chastelain in his, but the sick man found this cabin too stuffy so the next day I occupied it again but left him my mattress so he could sleep even in the midst of the cannons. Hearing this, the Captain made me take one of his.

He reached the colony of New France in June. He travelled immediately to the Huron mission with a fellow Jesuit, Pierre Chastellain. By early August, he had arrived among the Nipissings.

He served for the rest of his life as a missionary among the Huron and never returned to France. The Huron nicknamed him &quot;Ouracha&quot;, or &quot;rain-giver&quot;, after his arrival was followed by a drought-ending rainfall. He was greatly influenced by a fellow missionary, Jean de Brébeuf, and was known as the &quot;lamb&quot; to Brebeuf&#x27;s &quot;lion&quot;. In 1639 and 1640, he wintered in the land of the Petun. From 1641 to 1646, Garnier was at the Saint-Joseph mission.

There were raids between Iroquois and Huron forces. When he learned that Brébeuf and Lalemant had been killed in March 1649 by Iroquois after a raid on a Huron village, Garnier knew he too might soon die. On December 7, 1649, he was killed by musket fire from the Iroquois during an attack on the Petun village in which he was living.

Garnier was canonized in 1930 by Pope Pius XI with the seven other Canadian Martyrs (also known as the North American Martyrs), His feast day is October 19.

<text>Dominique Laffin (June 3, 1952, in Saint-Mandé, Val-de-Marne, France – June 12, 1985, in Paris) was a French actress who appeared in 19 films between 1975 and 1985.

Laffin made her major film debut in 1977, gaining critical acclaim for her role in Jacques Doillon&#x27;s 1979 film, &quot;La Femme qui pleure&quot;. For her performance, she was nominated for the César Award for Best Actress. That same year, she co-starred with a young Roberto Benigni in the film &quot;Chiedo asilo&quot;.

Her career was cut short at the age of 33 by a massive heart attack. Her daughter later said that she believed Laffin had committed suicide, but says that she has not been able to confirm this either way. During her short career, Laffin appeared with many of France&#x27;s rising young stars, including Gérard Depardieu, Juliette Binoche and Miou-Miou, and established stars such as Yves Montand.

Laffin is buried near the renowned director François Truffaut in the Cimetière de Montmartre in the Montmartre Quarter of Paris.

Her daughter, the French politician Clémentine Autain, was born in 1973.

<text>Tracy Lee Lawrence (born January 27, 1968) is an American country music singer, songwriter, and record producer. Born in Atlanta, Texas, and raised in Foreman, Arkansas, Lawrence began performing at age 15 and moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1990 to begin his country music career. He signed to Atlantic Records Nashville in 1991 and made his debut late that year with the album &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot;. Five more studio albums, as well as a live album and a compilation album, followed throughout the 1990s and into 2000 on Atlantic before the label&#x27;s country division was closed in 2001. Afterward, he recorded for Warner Bros. Records, DreamWorks Records, Mercury Records Nashville, and his own labels, Rocky Comfort Records and Lawrence Music Group.

Lawrence has released a total of 14 studio albums. His most commercially successful albums are &quot;Alibis&quot; (1993) and &quot;Time Marches On&quot; (1996), both certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). He has charted more than forty singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts, including eight songs that reached the number one position: &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot;, &quot;Alibis&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Break It to My Heart&quot;, &quot;My Second Home&quot;, &quot;If the Good Die Young&quot;, &quot;Texas Tornado&quot;, &quot;Time Marches On&quot;, and &quot;Find Out Who Your Friends Are&quot;. Of these, &quot;Time Marches On&quot; is his longest-lasting at three weeks, while &quot;Find Out Who Your Friends Are&quot; set a record at the time for the slowest ascent to the top of that chart. His musical style is defined mainly by neotraditional country and honky-tonk influences, although he has also recorded country pop, Christmas music, and Christian country music. He has won Top New Male Vocalist from &quot;Billboard&quot; in 1992 and from Academy of Country Music in 1993, and Vocal Event of the Year from the Country Music Association in 2007.

==Biography==
Tracy Lee Lawrence was born in Atlanta, Texas, on January 27, 1968. He was raised by his stay-at-home mother JoAnn Dickens and stepfather Duane Dickens. He has two brothers and three sisters. When Lawrence was four years old, his family moved to Foreman, Arkansas. Growing up there, Lawrence sang in the local Methodist church choir and learned to play guitar. His mother had wanted him to grow up to be a minister, but he wanted to pursue a musical career instead. Regarding his upbringing, Lawrence told &quot;Country Weekly&quot; magazine in 1996, &quot;I was hell-bent on doing things my way. I bucked my stepfather. He thought I was risking too much chasing this crazy music dream.&quot; Lawrence began performing publicly in local clubs at age 15. By age 17, he had joined a local honky-tonk band. He attended Southern Arkansas University in 1986 to study mass communications, where he also became a brother of Sigma Pi, but dropped out two years later to sing for a band based out of Louisiana. When the band broke up, Lawrence moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1990, supporting himself through odd jobs. He also became a regular performer at several different Nashville nightclubs and bars, and further supported himself through winning local talent competitions. After performing at an artist showcase at Nashville&#x27;s Bluebird Café in January 1991, Lawrence was discovered by talent manager Wayne Edwards, who helped him sign to Atlantic Records&#x27; Nashville division. This signing took place only seven months after his move to Nashville.

==Musical career==

===1991–1993: &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot;===
After signing to Atlantic Nashville, Lawrence began recording his debut album &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot;. On May 31, 1991, after he had completed the album&#x27;s vocal tracks, Lawrence was injured when walking a high school friend named Sonja Wilkerson to the door of her hotel room at a Quality Inn in downtown Nashville. He was confronted by three men who intended to rape Wilkerson and rob both of them. Lawrence resisted and was shot four times, allowing his friend to escape. Two of the wounds were major and necessitated surgery at Nashville&#x27;s Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and one bullet remained embedded in his hip. The shooting and subsequent surgery also delayed the release of the album so that he would have time to recover before promoting it.

&quot;Sticks and Stones&quot;, upon its late-1991 release, accounted for four singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts. First was the album&#x27;s title track, which reached the number-one position on that chart in January 1992. Following it were three additional top-ten hits: &quot;Today&#x27;s Lonely Fool&quot;, &quot;Runnin&#x27; Behind&quot;, and &quot;Somebody Paints the Wall.&quot; The last of these was originally released by Josh Logan, whose version had made the lower regions of the same chart in 1989. Contributing songwriters to the album included John Scott Sherrill, Mark D. Sanders, Tim Menzies, Bob DiPiero, Lawrence himself, and Kenny Beard, who would go on to write many of Lawrence&#x27;s other singles as well. Another cut from the album, &quot;Paris, Tennessee&quot;, was also recorded by co-writer Dennis Robbins on his 1992 album &quot;Man with a Plan&quot;, and by Kenny Chesney on his 1995 album &quot;All I Need to Know&quot;. Musicians on the album included Bruce Bouton, Mark Casstevens, and Milton Sledge of Garth Brooks&#x27; studio band The G-Men, along with session musicians Brent Rowan and Glenn Worf. James Stroud produced the album, and played drums on the track &quot;Between Us&quot;. &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot; was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of one million copies. The album received an &quot;A−&quot; from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, whose writer Alanna Nash said that he &quot;pairs a poised and confident baritone with witty and well-crafted songs that shed soft light in the dark corners of the human condition.&quot; In 1992, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine named him Top New Male Vocalist.

===1993–1994: &quot;Alibis&quot;===
In 1993, Lawrence released his second album, &quot;Alibis&quot;, which earned a double-platinum RIAA certification for shipments of two million copies. All four of its singles reached the number-one position on the Hot Country Songs charts between early 1993 and early 1994: the title track, &quot;Can&#x27;t Break It to My Heart&quot;, &quot;My Second Home&quot;, and &quot;If the Good Die Young&quot;. The title track also accounted for his first entry on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, reaching number 72 there. Also produced by Stroud, the album contained songs co-written by Don Schlitz, Randy Boudreaux, and Craig Wiseman. Lawrence himself co-wrote &quot;Can&#x27;t Break It to My Heart&quot; with &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot; co-writer Elbert West, and &quot;My Second Home&quot; with Beard. Lawrence told the blog Taste of Country in 2018 that he &quot;fought&quot; with Atlantic executives over recording &quot;Can&#x27;t Break It to My Heart&quot;, because the label wanted him to record more ballads akin to those of then-labelmate John Michael Montgomery instead. A review of &quot;Alibis&quot; in &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine praised the title track, &quot;I Threw the Rest Away&quot;, and &quot;It Only Takes One Bar (To Make a Prison)&quot; as the strongest cuts, while noting the &quot;conviction and authenticity&quot; in Lawrence&#x27;s voice. Nash was less positive, writing in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that Lawrence &quot;settles for clichéd themes and mawkish delivery&quot;. Lawrence promoted the album through a tour with George Jones, and signed a deal with the Stetson hat company to advertise a new line of hats. Also in 1993, he was awarded as Top New Male Vocalist by the Academy of Country Music.

===1994–1995: &quot;I See It Now&quot; and &quot;Tracy Lawrence Live&quot;===
Lawrence&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;I See It Now&quot; had its title track serve as the lead single. Co-written by Larry Boone, Paul Nelson, and Woody Lee (who also recorded for Atlantic Nashville at the time), it peaked at number two on the country charts and 84 on the Hot 100. Followup &quot;As Any Fool Can See&quot; also went to number two on the former, while the Bobby Braddock-penned &quot;Texas Tornado&quot; became his sixth number-one hit on Hot Country Songs in mid-1995 and its B-side &quot;If the World Had a Front Porch&quot; also reached number two afterward. Also included on the album were the John Anderson duet &quot;Hillbilly with a Heartache&quot;, previously found on Anderson&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Country &#x27;til I Die&quot;, and the song &quot;I Got a Feelin&#x27;&quot;, co-written by Joe Diffie and later recorded by him on his 1997 album &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot;. &quot;I See It Now&quot; had seven of its tracks produced by Stroud, while three others accounted for Lawrence&#x27;s first co-production credits: he produced &quot;Texas Tornado&quot; by himself, &quot;As Any Fool Can See&quot; with Flip Anderson of his touring band, and &quot;Hillbilly with a Heartache&quot; with both Flip Anderson and Stroud. Lawrence promoted &quot;I See It Now&quot; throughout 1995 with a tour consisting of over 200 shows. Nash found &quot;I See It Now&quot; superior to its predecessor, stating that Lawrence &quot;returns to the honky-tonk sound of his debut, balancing melodic ballads of regret with kick-butt rhythms and lively wordplay.&quot; Allmusic rated the album 4 out of 5 stars, with an uncredited review praising the album&#x27;s honky-tonk sound, along with the &quot;cute lyrical twists for which country music is famous&quot;. An also uncredited review in &quot;People&quot; praised the title track and closing track &quot;I’d Give Anything to Be Your Everything Again&quot; as &quot;lovely, bittersweet accounts of romance lost&quot;, but criticized the lyrics of &quot;If the World Had a Front Porch&quot;. &quot;I See It Now&quot; received RIAA platinum certification.

Also in 1995, he released a live acoustic album, &quot;Tracy Lawrence Live&quot;. The album included live recordings of nine previous singles, plus the album track &quot;I Threw the Rest Away&quot; from &quot;Alibis&quot;. Lawrence compiled the album from 40 different live shows from the six months prior to the disc&#x27;s release, and once again produced with Flip Anderson. The album was originally to have been titled &quot;Tracy Lawrence Live and Unplugged&quot;, but it was retitled due to MTV claiming a copyright on the term &quot;unplugged&quot;.

===1995–1997: &quot;Time Marches On&quot;===
&quot;Time Marches On&quot;, his fourth album, was released in January 1996. It became his second double-platinum album in 2000. The lead single was &quot;If You Loved Me&quot;, a number four entry on the Hot Country Songs charts. Lawrence said of the song that &quot;it’s a typical Tracy Lawrence ballad about love gone wrong&quot;, and that he felt that it was one of his strongest singles. Following this song was the album&#x27;s title track; also written by Braddock, it became Lawrence&#x27;s longest-lasting number-one single on Hot Country Songs, holding that position for three weeks. It was also nominated by the Country Music Association as Single of the Year. After this song came &quot;Stars over Texas&quot; (which Lawrence co-wrote with Boone) and &quot;Is That a Tear&quot;, both peaking at number two. The album&#x27;s production duties were split, with Don Cook (best known for his work with Brooks &amp; Dunn) handling five tracks, and Lawrence and Anderson on the other five. Brian Wahlert of &quot;Country Standard Time&quot; noted that the tracks produced by Lawrence and Anderson were more traditional country in their sound than the tracks Cook produced, highlighting &quot;Is That a Tear&quot; and &quot;Somewhere Between the Moon and You&quot; as the strongest and most country-sounding cuts. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic wrote that the album was &quot;another crowd-pleasing set of contemporary country. Like his previous albums, the song selection is a hit-or-miss affair, with about half of the songs failing to make much of an impression. The remainder, however, proves why Lawrence is one of the most popular singers in Nashville.&quot; In 1996, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Lawrence as the tenth most-played radio artist in any genre that year.

===1997–1998: &quot;The Coast Is Clear&quot; ===
Lawrence&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;The Coast Is Clear&quot;, was issued in March 1997 and achieved an RIAA gold certification two months later. Like its predecessor, it featured some songs produced by Cook, and others by Lawrence and Anderson. This album&#x27;s first two singles &quot;Better Man, Better Off&quot; and &quot;How a Cowgirl Says Goodbye&quot; both made top five on Hot Country Songs, but the followups were less successful: the title track became his first single to miss the top 10 when it peaked at number 26, and &quot;While You Sleep&quot; fell outside the top 40. Tom Roland of &quot;The Tennessean&quot; noted that the album had a theme of &quot;attempts to undo what&#x27;s done&quot;, but criticized the sound as &quot;restrained&quot; and &quot;middle-of-the-road&quot;. Sarah Rodman of Country Standard Time shared a similar opinion of the production, calling &quot;While You Sleep&quot; the &quot;most emotive and touching song&quot; while also referring to &quot;How a Cowgirl Says Goodbye&quot; as &quot;lively&quot;. Atlantic issued a greatest-hits package, &quot;The Best of Tracy Lawrence&quot;, in 1998. This disc included thirteen previous singles and the new song &quot;Her Old Stompin&#x27; Ground&quot;. Three years after its release, this compilation received RIAA gold certification.

===1999–2002: &quot;Lessons Learned&quot; and &quot;Tracy Lawrence&quot;===

In late 1999, Lawrence returned to the charts with &quot;Lessons Learned&quot;. This was the lead single to his 2000 album of the same name, which he and Anderson produced with audio engineer Butch Carr. The song reached number three on the country charts in 2000, and accounted for his highest Hot 100 peak of number 40. The album charted two more singles in &quot;Lonely&quot; and &quot;Unforgiven&quot;. Tom Roland gave &quot;Lessons Learned&quot; three out of five stars in a review for &quot;The Tennessean&quot;, noting that Lawrence &quot;repeatedly sings of flaws and errors and the challenges in overcoming them.&quot; Erlewine wrote of the album in Allmusic that it is &quot;certainly pleasant, yet it tends to fade into the background&quot;. Jeffrey B. Remz of Country Standard Time thought that the album maintained a constantly country sound, and had well-written songs.

In late 2000, Atlantic Records closed its Nashville division and moved all artists, including Lawrence, to the Nashville branch of parent company Warner Bros. Records. His only release for that label, &quot;Tracy Lawrence&quot;, accounted for two low-charting singles in &quot;Life Don&#x27;t Have to Be So Hard&quot; and &quot;What a Memory&quot;. Lawrence and Anderson produced the album and wrote several songs on it, with other contributing writers including Michael White, Casey Beathard, Billy Yates, and frequent collaborator Larry Boone. Both Country Standard Time and Allmusic praised the album for having a more consistent and traditional sound than its predecessors, with the former&#x27;s Scott Homewood calling it &quot;quite possibly his best album&quot;, and the latter&#x27;s Liana Jonas complimenting the lyrics of both singles along with the &quot;scaled down&quot; production. Allmusic biographer Steve Huey wrote of the album that &quot;Despite some good reviews, it failed to halt his downward commercial momentum.&quot; Lawrence also said that he felt that the label did not invest in promotion of the album due to a lack of interest in his musical style and direction. As a result, he began seeking out new producers in an attempt to &quot;reinvent [him]self&quot;. He considered Buddy Cannon, Byron Gallimore, and Billy Joe Walker Jr. before choosing to reunite with Stroud. The two began recording for what would have been a second album for Warner Bros. in 2002, but Lawrence was dropped from the label&#x27;s roster.

===2003–2004: &quot;Strong&quot;===
After being dropped from Warner Bros., Lawrence began seeking a new record deal. He had considered RCA Records Nashville, but instead chose DreamWorks Records Nashville, of which Stroud was then the president, and signed a deal with them in October 2003. His first release for the label was &quot;Paint Me a Birmingham&quot;, which had been concurrently released by Ken Mellons on an independent label. Lawrence&#x27;s version overtook Mellons&#x27;s in terms of airplay, reaching number four on Hot Country Songs and number 42 on the Hot 100 in early 2004. The corresponding album, &quot;Strong&quot;, came out in 2004, and it consisted largely of material from the unreleased second project for Warner Bros. Nashville. The album&#x27;s follow-up singles, &quot;It&#x27;s All How You Look at It&quot; and &quot;Sawdust on Her Halo&quot;, were less successful at country radio. Lawrence noted that he had writer&#x27;s block when attempting to come up with material for the album, and thus sought outside writers instead of his usual collaborators. He described the title track, about a divorced woman moving on with her life, a &quot;different than anything I&#x27;ve done in the past&quot;, while calling &quot;Stones&quot; the &quot;most traditional&quot; song, and noting the presence of &quot;story songs&quot; throughout. He also noted that the album was almost titled &quot;Stones&quot;, but was renamed to avoid confusion with his debut album &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot;.

Erlewine wrote in Allmusic that &quot;Strong&quot; &quot;ranks among his smoothest albums, a record dominated by ballads and where up-tempo songs are as polished as the slow ones.&quot; Peter Cooper of &quot;The Tennessean&quot; thought that the album had better-written songs than its predecessors, highlighting &quot;Paint Me a Birmingham&quot; and &quot;Sawdust on Her Halo&quot; in particular, but criticizing the application of Auto-Tune to Lawrence&#x27;s singing voice. Robert Woolridge of Country Standard Time thought that Lawrence&#x27;s singing was stronger on the ballads such as &quot;Paint Me a Birmingham&quot; as opposed to the more upbeat material, but criticized the &quot;mainstream production&quot;.

===2005–2006: &quot;Then and Now: The Hits Collection&quot;===
Following the closure of DreamWorks Nashville in 2005, Lawrence transferred to Mercury Nashville that same year. There, he released the compilation &quot;Then &amp; Now: The Hits Collection&quot;, which included fifteen of his previous hits, all of which (except &quot;Paint Me a Birmingham&quot;) had to be newly recorded as the label did not own the rights to the original recordings made while he was on Atlantic. Two new tracks were included as well, both of which were released as singles: a cover of Mark Nesler&#x27;s 1998 single &quot;Used to the Pain&quot;, and &quot;If I Don&#x27;t Make It Back&quot;, which was co-written by Bobby Pinson. Of this compilation, Erlewine wrote, &quot;These new versions are a little more laid-back than the originals, and they&#x27;re a little slicker too. And while that doesn&#x27;t necessarily suit Lawrence&#x27;s voice, which has grown a little thinner over the years, that doesn&#x27;t make &quot;Then and Now&quot; a bad listen.&quot;

===2006–2008: &quot;For the Love&quot; and &quot;All Wrapped Up in Christmas&quot;===

In 2006, Lawrence started his own record label, Rocky Comfort Records, in partnership with his brother Laney. The first act signed to the label besides Lawrence himself was Chad Brock. Lawrence&#x27;s first single for the label was &quot;Find Out Who Your Friends Are&quot;, which was released in August 2006 from the studio album &quot;For the Love&quot;. The song initially lingered below the Top 40 of the Hot Country Songs charts, but following the album&#x27;s release, it gained in radio interest due to the album containing as a bonus track an alternate version with Tim McGraw and Kenny Chesney on guest vocals. Thanks to the success of the alternate version, &quot;Find Out Who Your Friends Are&quot; became a number-one single on that chart in 2007. The song reached that position in its 41st week on the chart, setting a new record at the time for the slowest ascent to the top of the country charts, and the second-slowest on any &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. The re-recorded version received Musical Event of the Year honors at the 2007 Country Music Association (CMA) Awards, Lawrence&#x27;s first award from that association, along with the Academy of Country Music (ACM) Vocal Event of the Year award. Following this song were &quot;Til I Was a Daddy Too&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hide Redneck&quot;. The album&#x27;s title track was a duet with Brad Arnold of the rock band 3 Doors Down, while the track &quot;Speed of Flight&quot; was the first song in his career that Lawrence wrote entirely by himself. Michael Sudhalter wrote in Country Standard Time that &quot;the music on the 11-track debut matches the label&#x27;s traditional-sounding name.&quot;

Later in 2007, Lawrence issued a Christmas album entitled &quot;All Wrapped Up in Christmas&quot;, the title track of which peaked at number 57 based on Christmas season airplay. In 2008, both Zona Jones and Michael Scott signed deals with Rocky Comfort. Jones released the album &quot;Prove Me Right&quot; through the label in 2009.

===2009–2011: &quot;The Rock&quot; and &quot;The Singer&quot;===
Lawrence made his last Hot Country Songs chart appearance with the single &quot;Up to Him&quot; in early 2009. It is the first single for a studio album entitled &quot;The Rock&quot;, a Christian country album which was released in June 2009. It received 3.5 out of 5 from &quot;Country Weekly&quot; magazine, whose review noted that it &quot;emphasizes at all turns the shared imperfections that we all strive to overcome in order to be good people&quot;. Allmusic reviewer Todd Sterling thought that Lawrence &quot;sounds as comfortable singing songs about the Lord as he does singing straight country&quot;, calling it &quot;a positive collection that will appeal to people of all faiths.&quot; Country Standard Time reviewer Jessica Phillips also thought that the lyrics of the album were &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;uplifting&quot;, comparing the disc favorably to Randy Travis&#x27;s gospel albums. The album got a 2009 Grammy Award nomination for Grammy Award for Best Southern, Country or Bluegrass Gospel Album.

Due to financial difficulties, Lawrence closed the Rocky Comfort label after &quot;The Rock&quot; and established a second personal label, Lawrence Music Group, in 2011. His first release for this label was &quot;The Singer&quot; that same year. It was initially available solely from his website and digital music distributors, a decision that Lawrence made to test the viability of online distribution instead of physical sales. The album features only acoustic instruments, and includes acoustic re-recordings of &quot;Paint Me a Birmingham&quot; and &quot;Find Out Who Your Friends Are&quot;. Of the album, Lawrence said that he included more songs that he had written himself, because he felt that he had become more confident in his own songwriting skills. He also said that the album was &quot;different&quot; due to the increased presence of songs that he had written and the acoustic sound.

===2013–: Further releases on Lawrence Music Group===
Lawrence released the single &quot;Stop, Drop &amp; Roll&quot; to country radio in October 2012. It was the first single from the album &quot;Headlights, Taillights and Radios&quot;, released on August 20, 2013. Lawrence funded the album through Kickstarter. Contributing songwriters included Kurt Allison (of Jason Aldean&#x27;s road band and the production team New Voice Entertainment) and Kip Moore. Erlewine noted that the album was more country pop than Lawrence&#x27;s existing body of work, but stated that &quot;he sounds comfortable, assured, and quite charming on this enjoyable record.&quot; Michael Rampa of Country Standard Time also thought that the album was more country-pop, but praised the lyrics and Lawrence&#x27;s singing, saying of the content that &quot;Lawrence is both looking back at his two decades-plus career in country music while also taking a significant step toward the future.&quot; Lawrence promoted the album through a tour of the same name, which consisted of 28 shows throughout the year 2014, beginning with a concert at the Holmes Theater in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota.

In 2017, Lawrence released &quot;Good Ole Days&quot;, a compilation album which features nine of his hit singles re-recorded as duets with other country singers, including Tim McGraw, Luke Bryan, Justin Moore, Jason Aldean, and Luke Combs. It also features two original songs: the title track, which features both Brad Arnold and Big &amp; Rich, and the Craig Morgan duet &quot;Finally Home&quot;, whose proceeds were donated to Operation Finally Home, an organization that assists in housing for injured soldiers. A second Christmas album, &quot;Frozen in Time&quot;, was released in October 2018. The album includes a mix of original compositions and covers of Christmas standards. In May 2019, he announced the August 2019 release of a new studio album titled &quot;Made in America&quot;, whose title track is also the lead single. He called the album &quot;possibly the most personal album I have ever released.&quot; Lawrence co-wrote most of the album, with other songwriters including Chris Stapleton, Mark Nesler, and Carson Chamberlain.

Lawrence&#x27;s next project is a three-disc album called &quot;Hindsight 2020&quot;. In February 2021, he confirmed that each of the three discs would be released throughout 2021, starting with &quot;Volume 1: Stairway to Heaven Highway to Hell&quot; on April 23. Its first single is the title track, which Lawrence co-wrote with Craig Wiseman. When completed, the three albums will include a mix of original songs and re-recordings of existing songs. The second disc in this project, &quot;Volume 2: Price of Fame&quot;, was released in August. Included on it were re-recordings of &quot;I See It Now&quot;, &quot;Somebody Paints the Wall&quot;, and &quot;If the World Had a Front Porch&quot;, and duets with Montgomery Gentry member Eddie Montgomery and Tracy Byrd. The third installment, &quot;Volume 3: Angelina&quot;, was released in January 2022. The title track of the project was released as a single that same month; in addition, Lawrence stated that he would be touring in 2022 with Clay Walker, Randall King, and Alexandra Kay.

==Additional work==
Lawrence has contributed to multiple collaborative works in his career. The first was George Jones&#x27; 1992 single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Need Your Rockin&#x27; Chair&quot;, which featured him as one of several artists performing on the song&#x27;s final chorus, and received the Country Music Association Vocal Event of the Year for all artists involved. In 1994, Lawrence recorded &quot;Renegades, Rebels, and Rogues&quot; for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Maverick&quot;. This song was released to country radio as a single in mid-1994 after &quot;If the Good Die Young&quot; had peaked, and it went on to reach top 10 on Hot Country Songs. The soundtrack also featured him in a multi-artist rendition of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;. Later in the same year, he covered Keith Whitley&#x27;s late-1989 single &quot;I&#x27;m Over You&quot; on &quot;Keith Whitley: A Tribute Album&quot;. In May 1996, Lawrence was one of many artists featured on the charity single &quot;Hope: Country Music&#x27;s Quest for a Cure&quot;, whose proceeds were donated to the T.J. Martell foundation for cancer research. The song made an appearance on Hot Country Songs, and received a Grammy Award nomination that year for all artists involved in the category of Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. In 1997, he recorded a cover of The Rolling Stones&#x27;s &quot;Paint It Black&quot; on the multi-artist tribute album &quot;Stone Country: Country Artists Perform the Songs of the Rolling Stones&quot;. Lawrence also began working as a producer for other artists in 1997, including Rich McCready&#x27;s 1997 album &quot;That Just About Covers It&quot; and the soundtrack to the musical &quot;The Civil War&quot;. The latter also featured him singing &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Pass This Way Again&quot;, which was issued as a single in October 1998.

==Music videos==
Many of Lawrence&#x27;s singles featured music videos that received rotation on CMT and the defunct TNN (The Nashville Network). In 1996, his videos were aired on CMT more than those of any other artist. Among his videos were several directed by Marc Ball which linked to each other through a time travel storyline, where Lawrence is transported to a different time period and scenario at the beginning of each video, and appears in clothing appropriate to the time period. The concept started with the video for &quot;If the Good Die Young&quot;, and continued for those of &quot;Renegades, Rebels, and Rogues&quot;, &quot;I See It Now&quot;, &quot;As Any Fool Can See&quot;, &quot;Texas Tornado&quot;, &quot;If the World Had a Front Porch&quot;, &quot;Is That a Tear&quot;, &quot;One Step Ahead of the Storm&quot; (an album cut from &quot;The Coast Is Clear&quot;), and &quot;Life Don&#x27;t Have to Be So Hard&quot;.

==Musical style==
Steve Huey wrote of Lawrence&#x27;s musical style that he was &quot;[o]ne of a number of rock-tinged honky-tonk singers who rose to fame in the early &#x27;90s&quot; and &quot;gained a loyal audience for his mix of modern and traditional country sounds&quot;. Erlewine described Lawrence&#x27;s musical style as &quot;polished, modern-day honky-tonk&quot;, and said that he &quot;has never been among the most adventurous country singers and of all the post-Garth Brooks new traditionalists; he often avoids honky-tonk grit, even though he has a nice twang in his voice that would work well on rowdier material.&quot; In a review of &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot;, Alanna Nash noted that Lawrence had a physical and musical resemblance to Alan Jackson. His singing voice has also been described as a &quot;smooth baritone&quot; and a &quot;warm baritone&quot; with &quot;effortless, emotional delivery&quot;. Lawrence cites Merle Haggard, Keith Whitley, and George Strait as his primary musical influences.

==Personal life==
In April 1994, Lawrence was charged with reckless endangerment and possession of an unlicensed firearm after confronting and following home two teenagers on a highway in Wilson County, Tennessee. Although he was put on probation for a year, the charges were later cleared.

Lawrence has been married three times. His first wife was former rodeo star Frances Weatherford, whom he married in 1993. Weatherford was injured by broken glass and suffered a miscarriage after a gas fireplace explosion, and the two divorced in 1996. In March 1997 he married his second wife, Stephenie &quot;Stacie&quot; Drew, a former member of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. Their wedding included over 500 guests, along with performances by Toby Keith, Tracy Byrd, and Kenny Chesney. In October 1997, Lawrence underwent investigation after allegations that he had abused Drew following a concert at Buffalo Bill&#x27;s hotel and casino in Primm, Nevada. This incident occurred one month after the couple had filed for divorce. Lawrence was convicted of a misdemeanor for battery, and was ordered by Las Vegas courts to donate $500 to a Nevada-based women&#x27;s shelter. &quot;Billboard&quot; also reported that Atlantic Nashville&#x27;s president had suspended Lawrence from recording any new material until he agreed to undergo counseling, but he later denied these claims. He married his third wife, Becca, in a secret wedding ceremony just after Christmas 2000. The couple had a child named Skylar the following June. Two years later, they had a second daughter, Mary Keagan.

<text>Harry Zell Thomason (born November 30, 1940) is an American film and television producer and director, best known for the television series &quot;Designing Women&quot;. Thomason and his wife, Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, are close friends of President Bill Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and played a major role in President Clinton&#x27;s election campaigns.

== Biography ==
Harry Z. Thomason was born in Hampton, Arkansas, the son of a Southern Baptist deacon. He was a Little Rock, Arkansas, high school science teacher and football coach. He married and divorced Judy Crump, with whom he has a daughter, Stacy.

In 1983, Thomason and his second wife, Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, were married and formed Mozark Productions, the vehicle for several successful television series, including &quot;Designing Women&quot;, &quot;Hearts Afire&quot;, and &quot;Evening Shade&quot;. In 2007, they began production on the HBO series &quot;12 Miles of Bad Road&quot;, starring Lily Tomlin.

Thomason was a close friend of Bill Clinton and produced the glowing biographical film, &quot;The Man from Hope&quot;, the centerpiece of the 1992 Democratic National Convention. Thomason and his partner, Darnell Martens, provided charter air service for the Clinton campaign and served as an image consultant. After Clinton was elected, Thomason became embroiled in the Travelgate scandal. His partner, Martens, reported that he had heard rumors that the White House Travel Office was corrupt and disloyal to the Clintons. This view of the Travel Office was compounded by a series of leaks at the White House that were unfavorable to the Clintons. Thomason began pressing Hillary Clinton to investigate the travel office. When the financial irregularities were discovered, the White House called in the FBI. The resulting firings generated a great deal of negative press coverage and an investigation of the events surrounding it, including Thomason and Martens&#x27; air service. Thomason served as co-chairman of the 1992 Presidential Inauguration Committee and once again worked as an image consultant at the beginning of the Lewinsky scandal. Thomason ended up testifying before the Lewinsky Grand Jury.

In 2004, Thomason produced the film documentary version of &quot;The Hunting of the President&quot; from the book by Joe Conason and Gene Lyons, about political efforts to discredit and defeat Bill and Hillary Clinton. With Nickolas Perry, Thomason was nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Documentary Screenplay for the film.

<text>The James G. Boswell Foundation is the charitable foundation established in 1947 by James Griffin Boswell (May 13, 1882 – 1952), founder of the J. G. Boswell Company, a successful farm and agricultural supplies enterprise established in Corcoran, California in 1921. The Foundation supports agricultural, general education, health concerns, pre-college private schools, public broadcasting, rural affairs groups and youth organizations. The Foundation has also provided support for the Institute for Agricultural Genomics at the University of California, Riverside.

Until his death in 2009, the Foundation was headed by J. G. Boswell, II, nephew of the company founder. J.W. Boswell, son of J.G. Boswell, II, now heads company operations, centered in California&#x27;s Central Valley. A primary asset of the Boswell Foundation is its shareholding in the Boswell Corporation. Measured by farmed acreage, Boswell Corporation is the largest farming operation in California and one of the largest worldwide. Shares of the Boswell Corporation are traded on the &quot;pink sheets,&quot; but very little information on this business is publicly available, even for non-management shareholders.

<text>Michael Peter Woroniecki (also Michael Warnecki, Warneki, Worneki, Mike War, and Mike Wazowski; born February 4, 1954) is an independent, non-denominational Christian missionary. Woroniecki is well known for his ministry on college campuses and at various public events across the US over the span of the last 30 years.

==Early life and family==
Woroniecki was the youngest of a large Polish Catholic family who was raised in the city of Grand Rapids, Michigan. His mother became involved in the Catholic Charismatic Movement in the early 1970s and sought to introduce her children to the born again experience. In 1972, seeking a way out of Grand Rapids, he &quot;made a deal with God&quot; that he would attend prayer meetings with his mother if he could make All-City tailback in football and thus receive a scholarship for college. He got the title and the scholarship.

Woroniecki attended Central Michigan University (CMU) where he studied psychology and played varsity football from 1972 to 1976. He boasted of being able to bench press 400 lbs and run a 4.5 second 40-yard dash. Woroniecki explains in his Christian testimony that he forgot his deal with God and had a &quot;wild streak&quot;, involving himself in alcohol and partying. Woroniecki states that he was known to his teammates as the &quot;Crazy War&quot; and says he was arrested the summer of his freshman year for fighting in a bar, just to prove to his peers how tough he was.

During spring football practice in 1974, Woroniecki suffered a disabling football injury that threatened his athletic aspirations. About the same time, Woroniecki&#x27;s mother gave him a Bible, which he began to read. Woroniecki says God used this time of suffering and depression to break him of his pride, preparing him to receive the Gospel. Woroniecki attended the annual Catholic Charismatic Conference at University of Notre Dame the weekend of June 14, 1974 with his family. He was in the stadium when he says he told God that he didn&#x27;t know what the saying &quot;born again&quot; meant, but that he wanted everything that the Lord had for him. While sitting alone in the stadium, Woroniecki says that he gave his life to Jesus. At that moment, Woroniecki believes that he &quot;met the living Jesus&quot;. &quot;The grass and goalposts were the same but I was changed&quot; says Woroniecki, adding that he found significance in the recently painted &quot;Touchdown Jesus&quot; on the library mural right in front of him.

Woroniecki returned to college football practice in July that same summer. One day after practice, while in a bar with his teammates, Woroniecki says he ordered water in the place of his usual beer. His friends becoming curious, Woroniecki explained that he had met Jesus. Used to his outrageous life-of-the-party humor, they all mistakenly thought he was joking, and Woroniecki became the focus of ridicule and rejection by his teammates. He writes that he could not understand why people like Roger Staubach, a famous Christian athlete, were respected, yet he was rejected, until he read John 12:24 and 25. He reasoned that if the world hated Jesus without cause, they would also hate and reject him if he followed Him.

The same year, Woroniecki and his teammates went on to win the NCAA Division II Football Championship for the only time in Central Michigan&#x27;s history. Woroniecki graduated from Central Michigan with a B.S. in Behavioral Sciences in 1976. While at CMU, Woroniecki met a cheerleader from Detroit, Michigan, Leslie Jean Ochalek (later renamed &quot;Rachel Rebekah&quot;). Woroniecki and Ochalek married in 1979.

==Education==
Charles and Rose Woroniecki, Michael Woroniecki&#x27;s parents, were members of the Basilica of Saint Adalbert, a Roman Catholic church in the Polish west side of Grand Rapids. Michael Woroniecki attended a Catholic grade school adjoining his family&#x27;s parish and then advanced to West Catholic High School, another parochial school in Grand Rapids. During his senior year of high school in 1972, Woroniecki began attending Catholic Charismatic prayer meetings, part of his &quot;deal with God.&quot;

After graduating from Central Michigan, Woroniecki attended Melodyland School of Theology at Anaheim, California starting in 1976. A month after returning home from seminary that summer, his mother died from colon cancer.

Woroniecki applied to the Dominican and Franciscan Orders of the Catholic Church with the intention of helping to bring reform from within the Church. In his final round of interviews with the Dominican seminary near Chicago, Illinois, Woroniecki was refused immediate admission and decided on a different course of action. He then applied to the Franciscan seminary in his own hometown of Grand Rapids. After a semester of study at Aquinas College, Woroniecki was again offered an extended preparatory period. He chose to pursue other means of study.

In 1978, Woroniecki was accepted at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, a non-denominational institution. Woroniecki says he was &quot;deeply grieved&quot; by the professionalism and business-like attitude towards the things of God at Fuller. This atmosphere, Woroniecki claims, ultimately compelled him to stand on the campus lawn and preach &quot;the living Jesus&quot; to fellow students and professors when they came out of the chapel. He confronted classmates over the attitudes of scholastic pride and hypocrisy that he thought to contradict the life of Jesus of Nazareth. Woroniecki obtained his Master of Divinity degree from Fuller in 1980.

Upon returning to Grand Rapids, Woroniecki briefly attended and occasionally preached at Maranatha Church. Shortly thereafter, Woroniecki left to start his own home church and street preaching ministry.

==Ministry==
===Preaching===
Woroniecki returned to Grand Rapids after graduating from Fuller Seminary in the summer of 1980, where he preached on the streets and at various events while carrying a sign or cross, starting his own ministry called Cornerstone Christian Fellowship. As a result of, according to Woroniecki, &quot;youthful zeal&quot; and a city unsure of how to handle his unconventional evangelistic approach, Woroniecki was arrested numerous times over the next year and a half. In October 1981, he offered to leave town if the pending charges against him would be dropped. The offer was accepted and Woroniecki began to travel the US, stopping first in Atlanta, Georgia where street preaching is permitted.

To deliver his message, Woroniecki chooses college campuses, large sporting and political events as well as city centers. His wife and six adult children are often seen ministering alongside him.
In the early 1990s, he shipped a Ford van to England and then ferried it to France. The family traveled together across Europe and then to Tangier, Morocco. In May 1995, they preached in Casablanca, where Muslim law makes it a crime to declare Jesus as the Son of God. A riot resulted and the family was arrested. They were interrogated for eight hours by state officials, then ordered to leave the country.

Since leaving Grand Rapids 30 years ago, Woroniecki and his family have preached in all 50 U.S. states, Latin America, Europe, Russia and Morocco.

===Music===
Michael Woroniecki began creating music with an electronic keyboard in 1986. In the early 1990s he began using this music as another form of ministry on the streets of Europe. During the summers of 1992 to 1996 he performed in downtown city plazas and centers in places like London, Paris, Barcelona, Lisbon, Rome, Berlin, Budapest, Athens, and Moscow. Woroniecki says he used the music along with dances and Biblical skits as a means of communicating the gospel in countries where they did not speak the language. Michael does not consider himself professional but believes &quot;that music is a powerful tool to touch people of all walks of life&quot;.

During the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympic Games, Woroniecki was reported to have performed with his family outside the various venues using the event to reach the international crowds with his message. Beginning in 1997, Woroniecki traveled throughout Mexico and Latin America, playing on the streets.

Woroniecki claims that, from 2006 to 2009, he has self-produced eight music CDs which he and his family have distributed in their travels.

==Christian view==

Woroniecki preaches that one must &quot;get alone, study the New Testament and seek the Living Jesus to be Born Again&quot;. He says that today&#x27;s &quot;churches&quot; are not the true Church as seen in the Scriptures and cannot save anyone.

Woroniecki has used large banner signs and often a wooden cross to convey his message for the past 35 years. In his ministry Woroniecki addresses the Biblical themes of hypocrisy in the institutional system, grace, salvation, forgiveness, hell, judgment, deception and the consequences of sin. Because of this, Woroniecki has taken his share of verbal and physical opposition. He claims that these are the &quot;last days&quot; and that Jesus will soon return to judge the world. Woroniecki cites various Scripture verses in his pamphlets to substantiate his message that only by faith can a man be saved from hell and reconciled to God, a doctrine accepted by most mainstream Christians and defined by Martin Luther as sola fide.

The Bible figures strongly in Woroniecki&#x27;s beliefs and is a focal point of his preaching. Despite not holding a conventional position in an established religion, Woroniecki&#x27;s knowledge of Scripture and theology is extensive. His years of personal and scholastic study at three seminaries are reflected in his writings. Woroniecki believes in Biblical inerrancy and considers the Scriptures authoritative on all matters of life.

Woroniecki&#x27;s message is met on the streets with a variety of responses.

==Andrea Yates==
Woroniecki first met Rusty Yates in the mid-1980s while preaching on the campus of Auburn University. Rusty took some literature, and they corresponded by mail for the next several years. In 1989 Rusty introduced the Woronieckis to Andrea Kennedy, whom he had recently begun dating. Woroniecki said of this meeting that Andrea seemed slightly intimidated, and that he advised them not to marry quickly, the same advice he gave to other young couples.

The Yates and Woroniecki families stayed in touch by letter and telephone, and in 1998, the Yates family traveled to Miami after hearing that the Woronieckis were selling their motor home. Rusty bought the bus, a 1978 GMC that Woroniecki had used for his family&#x27;s travels. During the week that the Yates stayed, Woroniecki confronted Rusty, saying that he was &quot;willing to sacrifice his wife and children for the sake of his job&quot;. After this confrontation, Rusty and Woroniecki &quot;grew apart&quot;. In the months leading up to the drownings, Rusty described the relationship with the Woronieckis as not being very close.

Andrea Yates had suffered mental health difficulties for several years leading up to 2001. In June 1999 Yates took an overdose of sedatives and was hospitalized several times over the next two years. She was prescribed a variety of antidepressant and antipsychotic medications. On June 20, 2001, a few weeks after being discharged from Devereaux Texas Treatment Center, Andrea killed all five of her children.

In early 2002 Michael Woroniecki came to the attention of the national media when Yates&#x27;s trial started. Yates&#x27;s defense attorney, George Parnham, placed a copy of Woroniecki&#x27;s newsletter &quot;The Perilous Times&quot; into evidence, suggesting that the material was dangerous for someone like Yates, and defense team psychiatrist Lucy Puryear said on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; that &quot;Yates&#x27;s fate may have been different if she never met Woroniecki&quot;. Certain media outlets alleged that Woroniecki bore some responsibility for influencing Andrea.

However, both Michael Woroniecki and Rusty Yates dismissed the allegations. According to the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, &quot;[Russell] Yates said his relationship with Woroniecki was more like learning from a book. He was free to accept what he wanted and reject that which he didn&#x27;t&quot;. Yates said &quot;That&#x27;s just crazy&quot; when asked whether or not his wife was influenced by Woroniecki. He stated that Andrea had suffered schizophrenia, depression and delusions for years. Both Yates and Woroniecki characterized the connection between Woroniecki&#x27;s teachings and Andrea Yates&#x27;s state of mind as nothing more than sensationalist reporting. Woroniecki &quot;... certainly didn&#x27;t cause the delusion,&quot; says Yates.

Woroniecki called the defense&#x27;s claims &quot;ridiculous&quot;. He stated that he had only met Andrea personally four or five times over 20 years and that his relationship with her was &quot;one of nothing but love and compassion&quot;. Woroniecki said that he had warned Russell Yates that Andrea and their children needed his love. Peter Jennings of &quot;World News Tonight&quot; reported that Rachel Woroniecki wrote to Rusty and Andrea that they needed to reconcile their marriage. In an interview with &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; in March 2002, Mrs. Woroniecki said:

&quot;A major problem is that people think that by emulating our lifestyle they can have the joy and the love that we have without building a foundation in Jesus Christ.&quot;
Woroniecki was quoted by the &quot;Grand Rapids Press&quot; as saying, &quot;I will gladly sacrifice my reputation if it can spare Andrea from the death penalty and give her a second chance at life. However ... it is deceitful and irresponsible to blame doctors, hospitals, clinics or &#x27;postpartum depression.&#x27; They (Rusty and Andrea Yates) both know that the issues which culminated in this tragedy are much, much deeper.&quot;

==Currently==
Woroniecki and family members carried signs and preached outside both the Democratic National Convention in Denver and the Republican National Convention in Saint Paul in 2008.

In November 2010, Woroniecki and his family were seen ministering in Times Square in New York City, promoting their website www.ifanyoneisthirsty.com. The author writes that the primary point of their message was &quot;that Jesus is alive and that we need to actively seek him out&quot;, adding that despite any controversy, the family seemed to him to be genuine in their efforts to &quot;go all over the world and celebrate life and the living Jesus.&quot;

Jack Wellman, Christian evangelist, author and regular contributor to &quot;OVI Magazine&quot; and &quot;Yahoo! Voices&quot;, confirms that Woroniecki continues to take his message &quot;to the world and the streets of the nations&quot;. Woroniecki&#x27;s current message, according to Wellman, taken from Woroniecki&#x27;s website and literature, is:

 &quot;Are you willing to look deeper, beyond it all? Please give us a chance to help you. It will be well worth your time. What we offer you is not a new group, &quot;church&quot;, formulas, self exaltation or doctrines. What we offer you is the love of the living Jesus who has the answers that you are looking for&quot;.

Woroniecki remains active in his ministry and has recently visited various universities during the fall semesters.

<doc id="481767" wikidata="Q5093638" url="?curid=481767" title="Chester Lauck">
<text>Chester &quot;Chet&quot; Lauck (February 9, 1902 – February 21, 1980) was a comic actor who played the character of Lum Edwards on the classic American radio comedy &quot;Lum and Abner&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Chester Lauck was born in Alleene, Arkansas and 
raised in Mena, Arkansas. He graduated from Mena High School in 1920. In Mena, Chet met his future comedy partner Norris Goff. Though both began as blackface comics, they soon found success on Hot Springs, Arkansas radio station KTHS with a weekly rural comedy skit, basing their characters on acquaintances from Waters, Arkansas. This led to an NBC network radio series, broadcast first from Chicago, Illinois, in 1931. The radio series aired on Mutual, CBS, and ABC at various times during its 1931–54 run. It was sponsored by Quaker Oats, the Ford Dealers of America, Horlick&#x27;s Malted Milk, Postum, Alka-Seltzer, and Frigidaire.

In addition to starring as storekeeper Lum (full name Columbus Edwards, with surname usually pronounced &quot;Eddards&quot;), Lauck also played several other recurring characters, including Cedric Weehunt, Grandpappy Spears, and Snake Hogan. He reprised his radio role, opposite Goff, in seven motion pictures between 1940 and 1956. Lauck adopted grey hair and a moustache on-camera, to better match the picture most audiences would have of his radio character. 

For a brief time during the 1950s he bought and upgraded a ranch fifteen miles west of Las Vegas, later bought by Howard Hughes. It was turned into Spring Mountain Ranch State Park.

In 1956, Lauck began working as an executive with Continental Oil in Houston, Texas, specializing in public relations and advertising. He appeared as himself as well as Lum in a series of television commercials for Conoco on the programs &quot;Whirlybirds&quot; (1957–60) and &quot;The Blue Angels&quot; (1960–61). On August 27, 1957, he appeared as a guest challenger on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;.

Upon retirement from Continental Oil, Lauck moved to Hot Springs, Arkansas and co-founded an advertising agency with longtime associate Harlan Hobbs and son Chester Lauck Jr. Lauck Sr. was highly regarded as an after-dinner speaker and maintained a hectic schedule of appearances across the nation. During his California years, Lauck owned race horses which competed in Santa Anita. This expertise led to a 1970 appointment by Arkansas Governor Dale Bumpers in which Lauck became Commissioner of the Arkansas State Racing Commission.

In his later years, Lauck recorded new introductions for commercial cassette releases of the series and for syndication.

==Death==
Lauck died in a hospital in Hot Springs, Arkansas, on February 21, 1980, aged 78.

==Honors==
Lauck was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in the radio division.

<doc id="481770" wikidata="Q6702993" url="?curid=481770" title="Lum and Abner">
<text>Lum and Abner was an American network radio comedy program created by Chester Lauck and Norris Goff that was produced from 1931 to 1954. Modeled on life in the small town of Waters, Arkansas, near where Lauck and Goff grew up, the show proved immensely popular. In 1936, Waters changed its name to &quot;Pine Ridge&quot; after the show&#x27;s fictional town.

==Synopsis==
The series was created by co-stars Chester Lauck (who played Columbus &quot;Lum&quot; Edwards) and Norris Goff (Abner Peabody). Lum always pronounced his own name as Ed&#x27;erds and was very annoyed if Abner or anyone brought up his full first name. The two characters performed as a double act, with Lum generally playing the straight man to Abner&#x27;s attempts to break free from Lum&#x27;s influence. As co-owners of the Jot &#x27;em Down Store in the fictional town of Pine Ridge, Arkansas, the pair are constantly stumbling upon moneymaking ideas only to find themselves fleeced by nemesis Squire Skimp, before finally finding a way to redeem themselves. Lum and Abner played the hillbilly theme with deceptive cleverness.

In addition to the title characters, Lauck also played Grandpappy Spears and Cedric Weehunt while Goff played Abner, Squire Skimp, Llewelyn &quot;Mousey&quot; Grey, Dick Huddleston, and most of the other characters.

&quot;Lum and Abner&quot;, like most sitcoms of the era, had a live house band, in this case a string band in keeping with the show&#x27;s hillbilly humor. Marshall Jones, before his adoption of the &quot;Grandpa&quot; persona that made him famous years later, was among the band&#x27;s first members.

==Show history==
Lauck and Goff had known each other since childhood and attended the University of Arkansas together where they both joined the Sigma Chi fraternity. They performed locally and established a blackface act which led to an audition at radio station KTHS in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Prior to the audition, the two men decided to change their act and portray two hillbillies, due to the large number of blackface acts already in existence. After only a few shows in Hot Springs, they were picked up nationally by NBC, and &quot;Lum and Abner&quot;, sponsored by Quaker Oats, ran until 1932. Lauck and Goff performed several different characters, modeling many of them on the real-life residents of Waters, Arkansas.

When the Quaker contract expired, Lauck and Goff continued to broadcast on two Texas stations, WBAP (Fort Worth) and WFAA (Dallas). In 1933, The Ford Dealers of America became their sponsor for approximately a year. Horlicks Malted Milk, the 1934–37 sponsor, offered a number of promotional items, including almanacs and fictional Pine Ridge newspapers. During this period, the show was broadcast on Chicago&#x27;s WGN (AM), one of the founding members of the Mutual Broadcasting System. Effective July 1, 1935, the program was also carried on WLW (Cincinnati, Ohio), KNX (Los Angeles, California), and KFRC (San Francisco, California). Along with &quot;The Lone Ranger, Lum and Abner&quot; was one of Mutual&#x27;s most popular programs. In 1936, Dick Huddleston of Waters petitioned the United States Post Office to change the town&#x27;s name to Pine Ridge. Postum cereal sponsored &quot;Lum and Abner&quot; in 1938–40, before Alka-Seltzer picked up the duo. Miles Laboratories, manufacturers of Alka-Seltzer and One-A-Day Vitamins, became the longest-running sponsor, backing the program from 1941 until 1948. Over the course of its life, &quot;Lum and Abner&quot; appeared on all four major radio networks: NBC, Mutual, CBS and ABC (formerly NBC Blue).

In 1948, the show changed from a 15-minute &quot;comedic soap opera&quot; to a 30-minute self-contained show. New writers were added, including Flying Tiger ace Robert T. Smith, along with an orchestra and a live audience. The new format was unpopular and the series came off the air in 1950. Lauck and Goff experimented with other formats during the hiatus, finally changing back to a 15-minute, Monday-Friday show on ABC in 1953, but the revived show was discontinued the following year due to competition from television and Goff&#x27;s failing health (Goff would eventually recover and continue making media appearances well into the 1960s). The duo twice made attempts to transition to television, but neither effort was picked up by a television network.

===Episode status===
The team broadcast more than 5,000 shows, of which over 1,630 episodes exist today. The archive is extensive between 1935 and 1948, a rarity for 15-minute shows that were typically never recorded (most of its contemporary daytime programs have fewer than 100 episodes remaining). As with most old-time radio shows, very little pre-1935 content (in this case, two episodes) survive. Only a handful of post-1948 programs and some of the 1953–54 revival have survived; most recordings of those shows are believed to have been destroyed.

===Films===
Like several of their contemporaries, Lauck and Goff had the opportunity to bring their characters to life in movies. The &quot;Lum &amp; Abner&quot; radio show of March 29, 1940, &quot;The Store Closes to Shoot a Movie,&quot; announced a break in the radio series in order to make the first film of the series, &quot;Dreaming Out Loud&quot;, which was released the same year. At a rate of roughly one per year, another five films would be produced in the series.

* &quot;Dreaming Out Loud&quot; (1940)
* &quot;The Bashful Bachelor&quot; (1942)
* &quot;Two Weeks to Live&quot; (1943)
* &quot;So This Is Washington&quot; (1943)
* &quot;Goin&#x27; to Town&quot; (1944)
* &quot;Partners in Time&quot; (1946)

Ten years after the film series ended, by which point &quot;Lum and Abner&quot; had long left radio, a seventh film was released. 1956&#x27;s &quot;Lum and Abner Abroad&quot; was originally made for television, with the film divided into three episodes. Conceived as a three-part pilot for a TV series and filmed on location in Yugoslavia, it featured none of the staff from previous films or the radio series other than Lauck and Goff themselves. The series was never picked up, with the three episodes airing as a film in theaters.

==Legacy==

As well as inspiring the program and its characters, Pine Ridge, Arkansas is also home to the Lum and Abner Museum, which opened in the 1970s and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A replica of the Jot &#x27;em Down Store stands adjacent to the Museum. Other rural locations named after the show include Jot Em Down, Texas, Jot-Um-Down, North Carolina, and Pine Ridge, Oklahoma.

==The National Lum and Abner Society==
The National Lum and Abner Society, formed in 1984, published a bimonthly newsletter, &quot;The Jot &#x27;Em Down Journal&quot;, until 2007. Between 1985 and 2005 the organization held 20 annual conventions (skipping 2004) in Pine Ridge and Mena, Arkansas, playing host to numerous veterans of the &quot;Lum and Abner&quot; radio programs and motion pictures. Since 2007, the NLAS has existed as an organization with free membership with its &quot;Jot &#x27;Em Down Journal&quot; transferred to the NLAS website. Founding officers Sam Brown, Tim Hollis, and Donnie Pitchford have remained connected to the organization since the beginning.

NLAS Convention guest stars included radio–television–cinema veterans Roswell Rogers, Clarence Hartzell, Jerry Hausner, Elmore Vincent, Wendell Niles, Bobs Watson, Les Tremayne, Louise Currie, Willard Waterman, Parley Baer, Cathy Lee Crosby, Forrest Owen, Mary Lee Robb, Kay Linaker, Frank Bresee, Fred Foy, Barbar Fuller, Sam Edwards, Dick Beals, Rhoda Williams, Robie Lester, Ginny Tyler, Nancy Wible, and Dallas McKennon. Additionally, various family members and personal friends of Chester Lauck and Norris Goff were present.

The first NLAS &quot;Reunion&quot; took place in June 2011 as part of the annual Lum and Abner Festival in Mena, Arkansas to celebrate the 80th Anniversary of the &quot;Lum and Abner&quot; show as well as the 75th anniversary of the changing of the name of Waters, Arkansas to Pine Ridge. All 23 years of the NLAS publication &quot;The Jot &#x27;Em Down Journal&quot; are now available free of charge (see External Links below for the National Lum and Abner Society) in PDF format as well as audio for the blind (or anyone who chooses to listen).

A final NLAS Convention was held in 2015 featuring guest stars John Rose (cartoonist of &quot;Barney Google and Snuffy Smith&quot;) and Mike Curtis (writer of &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;).

Plans are underway for a series of radio programs containing the audio contents of all 1985-2025 NLAS Conventions.

==&quot;Lum and Abner&quot; comic strip==

Early in 2011, negotiations between Ethan C. Nobles of firstarkansasnews.net, the Chester Lauck family and cartoonist Donnie Pitchford resulted in a new comic strip series based on the classic radio programs and its characters. Beginning June 5, 2011, &quot;Lum and Abner&quot; officially began appearing in a &quot;Sunday strip&quot; format with a new installment each Sunday. The comic strip made its newspaper debut in &quot;The Mena Star&quot; of Mena, Arkansas on Thursday, July 28, 2011. It has since been signed by &quot;The Standard&quot; of Amity, Arkansas, and the nationally distributed &quot;Today&#x27;s Grocer&quot;.

Each strip is accompanied by an audio dramatization with voices, sound effects and music, a feature designed with blind fans of &quot;old time radio&quot; in mind, but one that any reader may access.

In April 2013, radio producer Joe Bevilacqua entered into an agreement with Donnie Pitchford to broadcast the &quot;Lum and Abner&quot; comics as part of his weekly radio show &quot;The Comedy-O-Rama Hour&quot;. The first two &quot;Lum and Abner&quot; radio comics premiered April 13, 2013.

The success of these broadcasts prompted the release of &quot;100 All New “Lum &amp; Abner” Comic Strips&quot;, an audiobook written and directed by Donnie Pitchford featuring a full cast. The three-hour-long audio theater is available from Waterlogg Productions and Blackstone Audio.

On Sunday, July 20, 2014, the characters of Lum and Abner were awarded a cameo appearance in the Harvey Award-winning &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; comic strip, written by Mike Curtis and illustrated by Joe Staton. Lum and Abner were introduced during the crossover in which Tracy rescues Annie, whose own comic strip ended in 2010.

In 2021, the comic strip celebrated the 90th anniversary of the first &quot;Lum and Abner&quot; radio broadcast as well as the 85th anniversary of the naming of Pine Ridge, Arkansas, along with the 10th anniversary of the strip.

==Quotes==

*&quot;Learn everything you can, anytime you can, from anyone you can - there will always come a time when you will be grateful you did.&quot;
*&quot;If you approach an opera as though it were something that always went a certain way, that&#x27;s what you get. I approach an opera as though I didn&#x27;t know it.&quot;
*&quot;If you can sell green toothpaste in this country, you can sell opera.&quot;
*&quot;Success is important only to the extent that it puts one in a position to do more things one likes to do.&quot;

<text>John David Newcombe AO OBE (born 23 May 1944) is an Australian former professional tennis player. He was ranked as the world No. 1 in both men&#x27;s singles and men&#x27;s doubles. Newcombe won a combined 26 major titles: seven in singles, a former record 17 in men&#x27;s doubles, and two in mixed doubles. He also contributed to five Davis Cup titles for Australia during an age when the Davis Cup was deemed as significant as the majors. &quot;Tennis&quot; magazine rated him the 10th best male player of the period 1965–2005.

==Biography==
Newcombe played several sports as a boy before devoting himself to tennis. Newcombe&#x27;s powerful serve and volley was the backbone of his attacking game. He frequently came up with a second-serve ace. He was the Australian junior champion from 1961 to 1963 and was a member of Australia&#x27;s Davis Cup winning team in 1964. He won his first Grand Slam title in 1965 by taking the Australian Championships doubles title with fellow Australian Tony Roche. That same year, the duo won the Wimbledon doubles title. They teamed to win the Australian doubles championship three more times, Wimbledon another four times and the US Championships in 1967, the French Championships in 1967, and the French Open in 1969. They won 12 Grand Slam titles, which remained the all-time record for a men&#x27;s doubles team until 2013, when it was surpassed by Bob and Mike Bryan.

Newcombe was the top ranked amateur in the world in 1967 according to Lance Tingay, &quot;World Tennis&quot; and an Ulrich Kaiser panel of 13 experts and was the first recipient of the Martini and Rossi award after finishing top of their points system in 1967. As a professional, Newcombe was ranked world number one in 1970 by Tingay, &quot;World Tennis&quot;, Bud Collins, Mike Gibson and Tennis magazine (Germany). He was also ranked world number one in 1971 by Tingay, Rex Bellamy, Collins, Frank Rostron and &quot;World Tennis&quot; and he and Stan Smith were joint recipients of The &#x27;Martini and Rossi&#x27; Award, voted for by 11 journalists. In 1973 Newcombe was ranked world No. 1 by Tingay and Judith Elian. In singles play, he was a two-time winner of the Australian Open, a three-time winner of Wimbledon, and a two-time winner of the US Open.

In January 1968, Newcombe signed a three-year professional contract with Lamar Hunt&#x27;s World Championship Tennis (WCT) and became part of the &quot;Handsome Eight&quot;, the original eight WCT players. Newcombe was guaranteed $135,000 annually, which was higher than what the best paid baseball player received that year. As a member of the WCT professional tour group and the Players&#x27; Union, Newcombe was banned by the International Tennis Federation from competing in the 1972 Wimbledon Championships and he joined the ATP boycott of the event in 1973.

Newcombe was the WCT champion for 1974, defeating Okker, Smith, and Borg in the final.

Newcombe&#x27;s final major win was the 1975 Australian Open, where he won a series of five set matches against Masters, Roche in the semifinal (saving match points), and Connors in a classic final. The final against Connors may have been his finest performance in tennis.

Newcombe was the last of the Australians who dominated tennis in the 1950s, 60s and 70s.

In his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer, the long-time tennis promoter and great player himself, included Newcombe in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time.

Newcombe was captain of the Australian Davis Cup team from 1995 until 2000.

He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985 and in 1986 his achievements were recognised with his induction into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

<text>Wayland D. Holyfield (March 15, 1942 – May 6, 2024) was an American songwriter and leader in the songwriting community.

==Personal life==
Wayland Holyfield was born in Mallettown, Conway County, Arkansas. He was educated in Arkansas public schools and attended Hendrix College at Conway, Arkansas before graduating from the University of Arkansas with a degree in marketing in 1965. Prior to his musical career Holyfield was a wholesale appliance salesman and advertising account manager. He and his wife, Nancy, had three grown children, Greg, Mark and Lee.

Holyfield died at his home in Nashville on May 6, 2024, at the age of 82.

==Early career==
In 1972, Holyfield left Arkansas and moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a songwriting career and his first song was recorded in 1973. He received his first number one hit with &quot;Rednecks, White Socks and Blue Ribbon Beer&quot;. In 1975, Holyfield achieved his first solo number one hit &quot;You&#x27;re My Best Friend&quot; recorded by Don Williams.

In addition to his collaborations with Williams, Holyfield&#x27;s songs have been recorded by numerous Nashville singers including George Strait, Reba McEntire, Barbara Mandrell, Kathy Mattea, Tammy Wynette, Conway Twitty, Charley Pride, Randy Travis, The Judds, Mark Chesnutt, John Anderson, Mel Street, Gary Allan, Johnny Rodriguez, The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, The Oak Ridge Boys, Ernest Tubb, Anne Murray and Charly McClain. During his career Holyfield was writer of over 40 Top Ten hits and 14 #1 hits. Some of his best-known songs are &quot;Could I Have This Dance&quot;, &quot;Some Broken Hearts Never Mend&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Til the Rivers All Run Dry&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re the Best Break This Old Heart Ever Had&quot;, &quot;Only Here for a Little While&quot;, &quot;Meanwhile&quot;, and &quot;Nobody Likes Sad Songs&quot;.

In his home state of Arkansas, Holyfield is most famous for his song &quot;Arkansas, You Run Deep In Me&quot; which was written for the 1986 Arkansas Sesquicentennial celebration. It was named one of Arkansas&#x27; official state songs in 1987. Holyfield played the song at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton in 1993.

==Leadership and awards==
Holyfield was the chairman of the Nashville Songwriters Foundation. He has been a member of the board of directors of the Nashville Songwriters Association International, (NSAI) for almost 25 years. Since 1990 he has been serving on the ASCAP board of directors, the first Nashville songwriter to do so, and as of 2007 will have served for almost 17 years.

Holyfield received a Grammy Award nomination in 1972 for &quot;Could I Have This Dance&quot; and in 1979, he received the NSAI Presidential Award. Holyfield has won 14 BMI Performance Awards and 16 ASCAP Performance Awards.

Holyfield was the 1983 ASCAP Country Writer of the Year co-winner and in 1992 he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and to the Arkansas Entertainers Hall of Fame.

<text>Mark Lavon &quot;Levon&quot; Helm (May 26, 1940 – April 19, 2012) was an American musician who achieved fame as the drummer and one of the three lead vocalists for The Band, for which he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. Helm was known for his deeply soulful, country-accented voice, multi-instrumental ability, and creative drumming style, highlighted on many of the Band&#x27;s recordings, such as &quot;The Weight&quot;, &quot;Up on Cripple Creek&quot;, and &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot;.

Helm also had a successful career as a film actor, appearing as Loretta Lynn&#x27;s father in &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1980), as Chuck Yeager&#x27;s friend and colleague Captain Jack Ridley in &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; (1983), Laura Dern&#x27;s father in &quot;Smooth Talk&quot; (1985), as a Tennessee firearms expert in &quot;Shooter&quot; (2007), and as General John Bell Hood in &quot;In the Electric Mist&quot; (2009).

In 1998, Helm was diagnosed with throat cancer which caused him to lose his singing voice. After treatment, his cancer eventually went into remission, and he gradually regained the use of his voice. His 2007 comeback album &quot;Dirt Farmer&quot; earned the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album in February 2008, and in November of that year, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked him number 91 in its list of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time. In 2010, &quot;Electric Dirt&quot;, his 2009 follow-up to &quot;Dirt Farmer&quot;, won the first Grammy Award for Best Americana Album, a category inaugurated in 2010. In 2011, his live album &quot;Ramble at the Ryman&quot; won the Grammy in the same category. In 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked him number 22 in its list of 100 Greatest Drummers of All Time.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Born Mark Lavon Helm in Elaine, Arkansas, Helm grew up in Turkey Scratch, a hamlet of Marvell, Arkansas. His parents, Nell and Diamond Helm, were cotton farmers who shared a strong affinity for music. They encouraged their children to play and sing at a young age. He saw Bill Monroe and His Blue Grass Boys at the age of six and decided to become a musician. Helm began playing the guitar at the age of eight and also played drums.

Arkansas in the 1940s and &#x27;50s stood at the confluence of a variety of musical styles, including traditional Delta blues, electric blues, country (including old-time music), and the incipient genre of rhythm and blues (R&amp;B). Helm was influenced by each of these styles, which he heard on the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; on radio station WSM and R&amp;B on radio station WLAC in Nashville. He also saw the last vestiges of minstrelsy and other traveling variety shows, such as F. S. Wolcott&#x27;s Original Rabbit&#x27;s Foot Minstrels, which featured top Black artists of the era.

A key early influence on Helm was Sonny Boy Williamson II, who played electric blues and early R&amp;B on the &quot;King Biscuit Time&quot; radio show on KFFA in Helena and performed regularly in Marvell with blues guitarist Robert Lockwood, Jr. In his 1993 autobiography, &quot;This Wheel&#x27;s on Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of the Band&quot;, Helm describes watching Williamson&#x27;s drummer, James &quot;Peck&quot; Curtis, intently during a live performance in the early 1950s and later imitating this R&amp;B drumming style. Helm established his first band, the Jungle Bush Beaters, while in high school.

Helm also witnessed some of the earliest performances by early rock and roll and rockabilly artists, including Elvis Presley, Conway Twitty, Bo Diddley, and fellow Arkansan Ronnie Hawkins. At age 17, Helm began playing in clubs and bars around Helena.

===The Hawks===
While he was still in high school, Helm was invited to join Ronnie Hawkins&#x27; band, the Hawks, a popular bar and club act in the South and Canada, where rockabilly acts were very successful. Helm&#x27;s mother insisted that he graduate from high school before touring with Hawkins, but he was able to play with the Hawks locally on weekends. After his graduation in 1958, Helm joined the Hawks as a full-time member and they moved to Toronto, where they signed with Roulette Records in 1959 and released several singles, including a few hits.

Helm reported in his autobiography that fellow Hawks band members had difficulty pronouncing &quot;Lavon&quot; correctly and started calling him &quot;Levon&quot; ( ) because it was easier to pronounce.

In 1961, Helm with bassist Rick Danko backed jazz guitarist Lenny Breau on several tracks recorded at Hallmark Studios in Toronto. These tracks are included on the 2003 release &quot;The Hallmark Sessions&quot;.

By the early 1960s, Helm and Hawkins had recruited an all-Canadian lineup of musicians, guitarist Robbie Robertson, bassist Rick Danko, pianist Richard Manuel, and organist Garth Hudson, all of whom were multi-instrumentalists. In 1963, the band parted ways with Hawkins and started touring as Levon and the Hawks and later as the Canadian Squires, before changing back to the Hawks. They recorded two singles, but remained mostly a popular touring bar band in Texas, Arkansas, Canada, and on the East Coast of the United States, where they found regular summer club gigs on the New Jersey shore.

By the mid-1960s, songwriter and musician Bob Dylan was interested in performing electric rock music and asked the Hawks to be his backing band. Disheartened by fans&#x27; negative response to Dylan&#x27;s new sound, Helm left the group in the autumn of 1965 for what turned out to be a two-year layoff, being replaced by a range of touring drummers (most notably Mickey Jones) and Manuel, who began to double on the instrument. He spent time with his family in Arkansas, and undertook sojourns in Los Angeles, where he experimented with LSD and performed with Bobby Keys, and Memphis and New Orleans, where he worked on a nearby oil platform. In the autumn of 1967, after what would later be called &quot;the Summer of Love&quot;, he returned to the group.

After the Hawks toured Europe with Dylan, they followed him back to the U.S., remaining under salary, and settled near Dylan&#x27;s home in Woodstock, New York. The Hawks recorded a large number of demonstration and practice tapes in nearby West Saugerties, New York, playing almost daily with Dylan, who had completely withdrawn from public life following a motorcycle accident in July 1966. These recordings were widely bootlegged and were partially released officially in 1975 as &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot;. The songs and themes developed during this period played a crucial role in the group&#x27;s future direction and style. The Hawks also began writing their own songs, with Danko and Manuel also sharing writing credits with Dylan on a few songs.
===The Band===

Helm returned to the group, then referred to simply as &quot;the band”, as it was known around Woodstock. While contemplating a recording contract, Helm had dubbed the band &quot;The Crackers”, but when Robertson and their new manager Albert Grossman worked out the contracts, the group&#x27;s name was given as &quot;the Band”. Under these contracts, the Band was contracted to Grossman, who in turn contracted their services to Capitol Records. This arrangement allowed the Band to release recordings on other labels if the work was done in support of Dylan. Thus the Band was able to play on Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Planet Waves&quot; album and to release &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;, both on other labels. The Band also recorded their own album, &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot; (1968), which catapulted them into stardom. Helm was the Band&#x27;s only American member.
On &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot;, Manuel was the most prominent vocalist, and Helm sang backup and harmony, with the exception of &quot;The Weight&quot;. However, as Manuel&#x27;s health deteriorated and Robbie Robertson&#x27;s songwriting increasingly looked to the South for influence and direction, subsequent albums relied more and more on Helm&#x27;s vocals, alone or in harmony with Danko. Helm was primarily a drummer and vocalist and increasingly sang lead, although, like all his bandmates, he was also a multi-instrumentalist. On occasion, Manuel switched to drums while Helm played mandolin, guitar, or bass guitar (while Danko played fiddle) on some songs. Helm played the 12-string guitar backdrop to &quot;Daniel and the Sacred Harp&quot;.

Helm remained with the Band until their farewell performance on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1976, which was the subject of the documentary film &quot;The Last Waltz,&quot; directed by Martin Scorsese. Helm repudiated his involvement with &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; shortly after the completion of its final scenes. In his autobiography, Helm criticized the film and Robertson who produced it.

===Solo, acting and the reformed Band===
With the breakup of the Band in its original form, Helm began working on a solo-ensemble album, &quot;Levon Helm &amp; the RCO All-Stars&quot;, with Paul Butterfield, Fred Carter, Jr., Emmeretta Marks, Howard Johnson, Steve Cropper, Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn, Booker T. Jones, and others. Levon Helm and the RCO All-Stars recorded &quot;Live at The Palladium NYC, New Year&#x27;s Eve 1977&quot;. The CD album released in March 2006 features over one hour of blues-rock music performed by an ensemble featuring Levon Helm (drums/vocals), Dr. John (keys/vocals), Paul Butterfield (harmonica/vocals), Fred Carter (guitar/vocals), Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn (bass), Cropper (guitar), Lou Marini (saxophones), Howard Johnson (tuba/baritone sax), Tom &quot;Bones&quot; Malone (trombone), and Alan Rubin (trumpet).

This was followed in 1978 by the solo album &quot;Levon Helm&quot;. More solo albums were released in 1980 and 1982: &quot;American Son&quot; and (once again) &quot;Levon Helm&quot;, both produced by Fred Carter, Jr. He also participated in musician Paul Kennerley&#x27;s 1980 country music concept album, &quot;The Legend of Jesse James&quot;, singing the role of Jesse James alongside Johnny Cash, Emmylou Harris, Charlie Daniels, Albert Lee, and others.

In addition to his work as musician, Helm also acted in several dramatic films. He was cast as Loretta Lynn&#x27;s father in the 1980 film &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, followed three years later by a role as U.S. Air Force test pilot and engineer Capt. Jack Ridley, in &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;. Helm was also the latter film&#x27;s narrator. The 1987 under-appreciated &quot;End of the Line&quot; featured Levon as a small-town railroad employee alongside Wilford Brimley and Kevin Bacon. He played a Kentucky backwoods preacher in &quot;Fire Down Below&quot;. He played an eccentric old man in the 2005 film &quot;The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada&quot; and appeared as Gen. John Bell Hood in the 2009 film &quot;In the Electric Mist&quot;. He also had a brief cameo as a weapons expert in the film &quot;Shooter&quot; with Mark Wahlberg.

In 1983, the Band reunited without Robbie Robertson, at first playing with an expanded lineup that included the entire Cate Brothers Band, but in 1985, paring down and adding Jim Weider on guitar. In 1986, while on tour, Manuel committed suicide. Helm, Danko, and Hudson continued in the Band, adding pianist Richard Bell and drummer/vocalist Randy Ciarlante and releasing the album &quot;Jericho&quot; in 1993 and &quot;High on the Hog&quot; in 1996. The final album from the Band was the 30th-anniversary album, &quot;Jubilation&quot; released in 1998.

In 1989, Helm and Danko toured with drummer Ringo Starr as part of his All-Starr Band. Other musicians in the band included singer and guitarist Joe Walsh, singer and pianist Dr. John, singer and guitarist Nils Lofgren, singer Billy Preston, saxophonist Clarence Clemons, and drummer Jim Keltner. Garth Hudson was a guest on accordion on some dates. Helm played drums and harmonica and sang &quot;The Weight&quot; and &quot;Up on Cripple Creek&quot; each night.

In the televised 1989 Juno Awards celebration, the Band was inducted into the Juno Awards&#x27; Hall of Fame. Helm was not present at the ceremony, but a taped segment of him offering his thanks was broadcast after the acceptance speeches by Rick Danko and Robbie Robertson. Richard Manuel&#x27;s children accepted the award on behalf of their father. To conclude the televised special, Rick Danko, Garth Hudson, and Robbie Robertson performed &quot;The Weight&quot; with Blue Rodeo.

Helm performed with Danko and Hudson as the Band in 1990 at Roger Waters&#x27;s epic The Wall – Live in Berlin Concert in Germany to an estimated 300,000 to half a million people.

In 1993, Helm published an autobiography entitled &quot;This Wheel&#x27;s on Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of the Band&quot;.

Helm&#x27;s performance career in the 2000s revolved mainly around the Midnight Ramble at his home and studio, &quot;The Barn&quot;, in Woodstock, New York. These concerts, featuring Helm and various musical guests, allowed him to raise money for his medical bills and to resume performing after a bout with cancer that nearly ended his career.

In the late 1990s, Helm was diagnosed with throat cancer after suffering hoarseness. Advised to undergo a laryngectomy, he instead underwent an arduous regimen of radiation treatments at Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. The tumor was then successfully removed, but Helm&#x27;s vocal cords were damaged, and his clear, powerful tenor voice was replaced by a quiet rasp. Initially, Helm only played drums and relied on guest vocalists at the Rambles, but eventually his singing voice grew stronger. On January 10, 2004, he sang again at his Ramble sessions. In 2007, during production of &quot;Dirt Farmer&quot;, Helm estimated that his singing voice was 80% recovered.

The Levon Helm Band featured his daughter Amy Helm, Larry Campbell, Teresa Williams, Jim Weider (The Band&#x27;s last guitarist), Jimmy Vivino, Mike Merritt, Brian Mitchell, Erik Lawrence, Steven Bernstein, Howard Johnson (tuba player in the horn section on the Band&#x27;s &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; and &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;), Clark Gayton, Jay Collins (Helm&#x27;s now former son-in-law), Byron Isaacs, and blues harmonica player Little Sammy Davis. Helm hosted Midnight Rambles that were open to the public at his home in Woodstock.

The Midnight Ramble was an outgrowth of an idea Helm explained to Martin Scorsese in &quot;The Last Waltz.&quot; Earlier in the 20th century, Helm recounted, traveling medicine shows and music shows such as F. S. Wolcott&#x27;s Original Rabbit&#x27;s Foot Minstrels, featuring African-American blues singers and dancers, would put on titillating performances in rural areas. (This was also turned into a song by the Band, &quot;The W.S. Walcott Medicine Show,&quot; with the name altered so the lyric was easier to sing.)

&quot;After the finale, they&#x27;d have the midnight ramble,&quot; Helm told Scorsese. With young children off the premises, the show resumed: &quot;The songs would get a little bit juicier. The jokes would get a little funnier and the prettiest dancer would really get down and shake it a few times. A lot of the rock and roll duck walks and moves came from that.&quot;

Artists who performed at the Rambles include Helm&#x27;s former bandmate Garth Hudson, Elvis Costello, Emmylou Harris, Dr. John, Mavis Staples, Chris Robinson, Allen Toussaint, Donald Fagen and Jon Herington of Steely Dan, Jimmy Vivino (of the house band on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;), the Max Weinberg 7, My Morning Jacket, Billy Bob Thornton, Alexis P. Suter, Sean Costello, the Muddy Waters Tribute Band, Pinetop Perkins, Hubert Sumlin, Carolyn Wonderland, Kris Kristofferson, Gillian Welch, David Rawlings, Justin Townes Earle, Bow Thayer, Luther &quot;Guitar Junior&quot; Johnson, Rickie Lee Jones, Kate Taylor, Ollabelle, the Holmes Brothers, Catherine Russell, Norah Jones, Arlen Roth, Elvis Perkins in Dearland, Phil Lesh, Grahame Lesh, Brian Lesh, Hot Tuna (Jorma Kaukonen introduced the group as &quot;the Secret Squirrels&quot;), Michael Angelo D&#x27;Arrigo with various members of the Sistine Chapel, Johnny Johnson, Ithalia, David Bromberg, the Youngers, and Grace Potter and the Nocturnals.

During this period, Helm switched to the matched grip and adopted a less busy, greatly simplified drumming style, as opposed to the traditional grip he used during his years with the Band.

Helm was busy touring every year during the 2000s, generally traveling by tour bus to venues in eastern Canada and the eastern United States. After 2007, he performed in large venues such the Beacon Theatre in New York City. Dr. John and Warren Haynes (the Allman Brothers Band, Gov&#x27;t Mule) and Garth Hudson played at the concerts along with several other guests. At a show in Vancouver, Elvis Costello joined to sing &quot;Tears of Rage&quot;. The Alexis P. Suter Band was a frequent opening act. Helm was a favorite of radio personality Don Imus and was frequently featured on &quot;Imus in the Morning.&quot; In the summer of 2009, a reality television series centering on the Midnight Ramble reportedly was in development.

In 2012, Levon Helm and his &quot;midnight rambles&quot; were featured on the PBS Arts site, &quot;Sound Tracks: Music Without Borders&quot;, including a poignant last interview with PBS&#x27;s Marco Werman.

===&quot;Dirt Farmer&quot; and comeback===
The autumn of 2007 had the release of &quot;Dirt Farmer&quot;, Helm&#x27;s first studio solo album since 1982. Dedicated to his parents and co-produced by his daughter Amy, the album combines traditional tunes Levon recalled from his youth with newer songs (by Steve Earle, Paul Kennerley, and others), which flow from similar historical streams. The album was released to almost immediate critical acclaim, and earned him a Grammy Award in the Traditional Folk Album category for 2007. Also in 2007, Helm recorded &quot;Toolin&#x27; Around Woodstock&quot;, an album with Arlen Roth on which Levon played drums and sang &quot;Sweet Little 16&quot; and &quot;Crying Time&quot;. This album also featured Levon&#x27;s daughter Amy, and Roth&#x27;s daughter Lexie, along with Sonny Landreth and Bill Kirchen.

Helm declined to attend the Grammy Awards ceremony, instead holding a &quot;Midnight Gramble&quot; and celebrating the birth of his grandson, Lavon (Lee) Henry Collins.

In 2008, Helm performed at Warren Haynes&#x27;s Mountain Jam Music Festival in Hunter, New York, playing alongside Haynes on the last day of the three-day festival. Helm also joined guitarist Bob Weir and his band RatDog on stage as they closed out the festival. Helm performed to great acclaim at the 2008 Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee.

Helm drummed on a couple of tracks for Jorma Kaukonen&#x27;s February 2009 album &quot;River of Time&quot;, recorded at the Levon Helm Studios.

Helm released the album &quot;Electric Dirt&quot; on his own label on June 30, 2009. Like &quot;Dirt Farmer&quot;, an aim of &quot;Electric Dirt&quot; was to capture of feel of Helm&#x27;s Midnight Rambles. The album won a best album Grammy for the newly created Americana category in 2010. Helm performed on the CBS television program Late Show with David Letterman on July 9, 2009. He also toured that same year in a supporting role with the band Black Crowes.

A documentary on Helm&#x27;s day-to-day life, entitled &quot;Ain&#x27;t in It for My Health: A Film About Levon Helm&quot; was released in March 2010. Directed by Jacob Hatley, it made its debut at the South by Southwest film festival in Austin, Texas, and went on to be screened at the Los Angeles Film Festival in June 2010. The film had a limited release in select theaters in the United States in the spring of 2013 and was released on DVD and Blu-ray later that year.

On May 11, 2011, Helm released &quot;Ramble at the Ryman&quot;, a live album recorded during his performance of September 17, 2008, at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. The album features Helm&#x27;s band playing six songs by the Band and other cover material, including some songs from previous Helm solo releases. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Americana Album.

Some of his last sessions recorded in 2011 with Mavis Staples were released in 2022 as &quot;Carry Me Home&quot;.

===Illness and death===

In April 2012, during the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremonies in Cleveland, Robbie Robertson sent &quot;love and prayers&quot; to Helm, fueling speculation about Helm&#x27;s health. Helm had previously cancelled a number of performances, citing health issues or a slipped disk in his back; his final performances took place in Tarrytown, New York, at Tarrytown Music Hall on March 24, and a final Midnight Ramble (with Los Lobos as the opening act) in Woodstock on March 31.

On April 17, 2012, Helm&#x27;s wife Sandy and daughter Amy revealed that he had end-stage throat cancer. They posted the following message on Helm&#x27;s website:

On April 18, Robertson revealed on his Facebook page that he had a long visit with Helm at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center the previous Sunday. On the same day, Garth Hudson posted on his personal website that he was &quot;too sad for words&quot;. He then left a link for a video of the Alexis P. Suter Band and himself performing Bob Dylan&#x27;s song &quot;Knocking on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;. Helm died on April 19 from complications of throat cancer at age 71.

Fans were invited to a public wake at Helm&#x27;s Barn studio complex on April 26. Around 2,000 fans came to pay their respects to the rock icon. The following day, after a private funeral service and a procession through the streets of Woodstock, Helm was interred in the Woodstock Cemetery, within sight of the grave of his longtime bandmate and friend Rick Danko. Former President Bill Clinton issued a statement following Helm&#x27;s passing.

==Legacy==
George Harrison said that while writing his 1970 song &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, he imagined Levon Helm singing it.

Elton John&#x27;s lyricist, Bernie Taupin, named the song &quot;Levon&quot; after Helm, although the song is not actually about him. Both John and Taupin cited that they were inspired by Helm; Taupin saying in various interviews that they would &quot;go down to their favourite record stores to buy The Band&#x27;s records&quot; along with Elton. 

In 1994, Helm was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Band.

Marc Cohn wrote the song &quot;Listening to Levon&quot; in 2007. &quot;The Man behind the Drums&quot;, written by Robert Earl Keen and Bill Whitbeck, appeared on Keen&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;The Rose Hotel.&quot; Tracy K. Smith&#x27;s 2011 poem &quot;Alternate Take&quot;, included in her Pulitzer Prize–winning collection &quot;Life on Mars&quot;, is dedicated to Helm. On the day of Helm&#x27;s death, April 19, 2012, Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers, in a concert at the First Bank Center in Broomfield, Colorado, paid tribute to Levon by performing their song &quot;The Best of Everything&quot; and dedicating it to him.

At a concert on May 2, 2012, at the Prudential Center in Newark, NJ, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band performed &quot;The Weight&quot; as a tribute to Helm. Springsteen called Helm &quot;one of the greatest, greatest voices in country, rockabilly and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll ... staggering ... while playing the drums. Both his voice and his drumming were so incredibly personal. He had a feel on the drums that comes out of certain place in the past and you can&#x27;t replicate it.&quot; Springsteen also said it was one of the songs that he had played with drummer Max Weinberg in Weinberg&#x27;s audition with the band.

On June 2, 2012, at Mountain Jam, Gov&#x27;t Mule along with the Levon Helm Band (with Lukas Nelson coming on stage for the closing song) played a tribute set, including &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,&quot; &quot;Up on Cripple Creek,&quot;&quot;It Makes No Difference,&quot; and closing with &quot;The Weight&quot;.

A tribute concert called Love for Levon took place at the Izod Center in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on October 3, 2012. The concert featured many special guests who had collaborated with and were inspired by Helm and the Band, including Roger Waters, Garth Hudson, Joe Walsh, Gregg Allman, Bruce Hornsby, Jorma Kaukonen, John Mayer, Mavis Staples, My Morning Jacket, Marc Cohn, John Hiatt, Allen Toussaint, Jakob Dylan, Mike Gordon, and others. Proceeds from the concert were to &quot;help support the lasting legacy of Levon Helm by helping his estate keep ownership of his home, barn and studio, and to continue the Midnight Ramble Sessions&quot;.

At the 2013 Grammy Awards, the Zac Brown Band, Mumford &amp; Sons, Elton John, Mavis Staples, T-Bone Burnett, and Alabama Shakes singer Brittany Howard performed &quot;The Weight&quot; as a tribute to Levon and other recently deceased musicians. They also dedicated the song to the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. In May 2013, the New York State Legislature approved a resolution to name State Route 375—the road which connects State Route 28 with the town of Woodstock—&quot;Levon Helm Memorial Boulevard&quot;. Governor Andrew Cuomo signed the bill on June 20, 2013. In July 2017, U.S. 49 from Marvell, Arkansas, to Helena–West Helena was named The Levon Helm Memorial Highway by Act 810 of the Arkansas State Legislature. The Levon Helm Legacy Project is raising money to commission a bronze bust of Helm and to restore his boyhood home. The house, originally located in Turkey Scratch, Arkansas, was moved in 2015 to Marvell, where Helm attended school.

==Personal life==
Helm met singer-songwriter Libby Titus in April 1969, while the Band was recording its second album. They began a lengthy relationship which produced singer-songwriter daughter Amy Helm (born December 3, 1970). Amy formed the band Ollabelle and performed with her father&#x27;s band at the Midnight Rambles and other concerts.

Helm met Sandra Dodd in 1975 in California, while he was still involved with Titus. Helm and Dodd were married on September 7, 1981. They had no children together.

<text>Ronald Cornett Hawkins (January 10, 1935 – May 29, 2022) was an American rock and roll singer, long based in Canada, whose career spanned more than half a century. His career began in Arkansas, United States, where he was born and raised. He found success in Ontario, Canada, and lived there for most of his life. Hawkins was an institution of the Ontario music scene for over 40 years. He was influential in the evolution of rock music in Canada.

Also known as &quot;Rompin&#x27; Ronnie&quot;, &quot;Mr. Dynamo&quot; or &quot;The Hawk&quot;, he was one of the key players in the 1960s rock scene in Toronto. He performed all across North America and recorded more than 25 albums. His hit songs include covers of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Thirty Days&quot; (retitled &quot;Forty Days&quot;) and Young Jessie&#x27;s &quot;Mary Lou&quot;, a song about a gold digger. Other well-known recordings are a cover of Bo Diddley&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Love?&quot; (without the question mark), &quot;Hey! Bo Diddley&quot;, and &quot;Susie Q&quot;, which was written by his cousin, rockabilly artist Dale Hawkins.

Hawkins was a talent scout and mentor of the musicians he recruited for his band, The Hawks. Roy Buchanan was an early Hawks guitarist on the song &quot;Who Do You Love&quot;. The most successful of his students were those who left to form The Band. Robbie Lane and the Disciples made their name opening for Ronnie Hawkins and The Hawks at the Yonge Street bars in Toronto, and eventually became his backing band. Others he had recruited later formed Janis Joplin&#x27;s Full Tilt Boogie Band, Crowbar, Bearfoot, and Skylark. Hawkins was still playing 150 engagements a year in his 60s.

==Early life==
Hawkins was born on January 10, 1935, in Huntsville, Arkansas, the son of Flora ( Cornett), a schoolteacher, and Jasper Hawkins, a barber. In 1945, the family, which included Hawkins&#x27;s older sister Winifred, moved to Fayetteville, where Hawkins was educated in the city&#x27;s public schools, graduating from Fayetteville High School in 1952. Musicianship ran in Hawkins&#x27;s family; Hawkins&#x27;s father, uncles, and cousins had toured the honky-tonk circuit in Arkansas and Oklahoma in the 1930s and 1940s. His uncle Delmar &quot;Skipper&quot; Hawkins, a road musician, had moved to California about 1940 and joined cowboy singing star Roy Rogers&#x27;s band, the Sons of the Pioneers. Hawkins&#x27; cousin, Dale Hawkins, the earliest white performer to sing at the Apollo Theater in Harlem and the Regal Theater in Chicago, recorded the rhythm and blues song &quot;Suzie Q&quot; in 1957. Beginning at age eleven, Ronnie Hawkins sang at local fairs and before he was a teenager shared a stage with Hank Williams. He recalled that Williams was too drunk to perform, and his band, the Drifting Cowboys, invited members of the audience to get on the stage and sing. Hawkins accepted the invitation and sang some Burl Ives songs he knew.

As a teenager, Hawkins ran bootleg liquor from Missouri to the dry counties of Oklahoma in his modified Ford Model A, sometimes making three hundred dollars a day. He claimed in later years that he continued the activity until he was nineteen or twenty, and that it was how he made the money to buy into nightclubs. He had already formed his first band, the Hawks, when he graduated from high school in 1952, following which he studied physical education at the University of Arkansas, where in 1956 he dropped out just a few credits short of graduation.

Hawkins then enlisted in the United States Army, but he was required to serve only six months, having already completed ROTC training. Soon after his arrival at Fort Sill in Oklahoma for Army Basic Combat Training, he was having a drink at the Amvets club when an African American quartet began to play their music. Hearing the first notes so stirred him that he jumped onto the stage and started singing. &quot;It sounded like something between the blues and rockabilly ... me being a hayseed and those guys playing a lot funkier.&quot; The experience caused Hawkins to realize what kind of music he really wanted to play, and he joined the four black musicians, who renamed themselves the Blackhawks.

The group had been performing jazz/blues music similar to Cab Calloway&#x27;s music of the 1940s, and Hawkins sought to introduce contemporary influences to their repertoire. With another new member, blues saxophonist A.C. Reed, they created some of the South&#x27;s most dynamic music sounds. &quot;[I]nstead of doing a kind of rockabilly that was closer to country music, I was doing rockabilly that was closer to soul music, which was exactly what I liked.&quot; The band encountered prejudice, as many white people in the American South of the 1950s could not accept an integrated band and considered rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and rhythm and blues the devil&#x27;s music.

The Blackhawks disbanded when his enlistment ended. Hawkins went back to Fayetteville, and two days later he got a call from Sun Records, who wanted him to front the house session band. By the time he got to Memphis, though, the group had already broken up. Nevertheless, he took advantage of the opportunity to cut two demos, Lloyd Price&#x27;s &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy&quot; and Hank Williams&#x27;s &quot;A Mansion on the Hill&quot;, but the recordings attracted no attention. The demo session guitarist, Jimmy Ray &quot;Luke&quot; Paulman, suggested that Hawkins join him at his home in Helena, Arkansas, in the heart of the Mississippi Delta region, a hotbed of blues, rhythm and blues, and country music, an offer which he eagerly accepted.

Immediately upon arriving in Helena, Hawkins and Paulman found Paulman&#x27;s brother George (standup bass) and their cousin Willard &quot;Pop&quot; Jones (piano) and formed a band they named The Hawks. Drummer Levon Helm, who had grown up in nearby Turkey Scratch, Arkansas, first played with the group at the Delta Supper Club in early 1957 when George Paulman invited him to sit in them for their closing set. Helm reminisced years later that Hawkins, accompanied by Luke Paulman, drove his Model A out to the Helm&#x27;s cotton farm, arriving in a cloud of dust to talk to Helm&#x27;s parents. Helm remembered him as &quot;a big ol&#x27; boy in tight pants, sharp shoes and a pompadour hanging down his forehead.&quot; Helm listened to Hawkins negotiate an agreement with his parents, who insisted that he graduate from high school before he could join The Hawks and go to Canada. Helm practiced diligently on a makeshift drum kit to improve his skills, and when he graduated in May, he was good enough to play drums in the band.

Hawkins&#x27;s live act included back flips and a &quot;camel walk&quot; that preceded Michael Jackson&#x27;s similar moonwalk by three decades. His stage persona gained him the monikers &quot;Rompin&#x27; Ronnie&quot; and &quot;Mr. Dynamo&quot;. Hawkins also owned and operated the Rockwood Club in Fayetteville, where some of rock and roll&#x27;s earliest pioneers came to play, including Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison and Conway Twitty.

With Helm&#x27;s graduation from high school, he joined the Hawks and they went to Canada, where the group met success. On April 13, 1959, they auditioned for Morris Levy, owner of Roulette Records in New York. Only four hours later, they entered the studio and recorded their first record tracks. Their first single, &quot;Forty Days&quot;, was a barely disguised knockoff of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Thirty Days&quot; with the song &quot;Mary Lou&quot; by Young Jessie on the B-side; it reached number 26 on the US pop charts, becoming Hawkins&#x27;s biggest hit.

After spending nearly three months in Canada, the band returned to the South, with their base in Hawkins&#x27; home town of Fayetteville. The band&#x27;s gigs in the southern states were mostly one-nighters or short run performances in Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. Helm loved to drive, and would drive the band two or three hundred miles to the next show in Hawkins&#x27; old Chevy, which Hawkins eventually replaced with a Cadillac towing a trailer containing their equipment.

==Career==
Hawkins and the group had begun touring Canada in 1958 as the Ron Hawkins Quartet on the recommendation of Conway Twitty, who told him Canadian audiences wanted to hear rockabilly. Their bassist George Paulman was abusing liquor and pills, so Hawkins left him behind, and they played without a bass on their first tour of Ontario. Their first gig was at the Golden Rail Tavern in Hamilton, Ontario, where, according to booking agent Harold Kudlets, all the bartenders quit when they heard the band&#x27;s sound and saw Hawkins&#x27;s stunts on stage. In 1959 he performed a number of live shows in the country and signed a five-year contract with Roulette Records. Working out of Toronto, Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks cut the LP &quot;Ronnie Hawkins&quot; in 1959, and with Fred Carter, Jr. taking Jimmy Ray &quot;Luke&quot; Paulman&#x27;s place on lead guitar, they cut another LP, &quot;Mr. Dynamo&quot;, the next year, both of them recorded on the Roulette label.

He subsequently moved to Canada (becoming a permanent resident in 1964). When he first came to Ontario he played gigs at places like the Grange Tavern in Hamilton, where Conway Twitty got his start, and made it his home base. In Toronto, where the Hawks dominated the local scene, Hawkins opened his own night club, the Hawk&#x27;s Nest, on the second floor of Le Coq d&#x27;Or Tavern on Yonge street, playing there for months at a time. After the move to Canada, the Hawks, with the exception of drummer Levon Helm, dropped out of Hawkins&#x27;s band. Their vacancies were filled by Southwest Ontarians Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson.

David Clayton-Thomas, a Canadian and future lead vocalist of the American group Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, said he heard the Hawks when he got out of prison in 1962: &quot;We young musicians would sit there by the bar at Le Coq d&#x27;Or and just hang on every note.&quot; This version of the Hawks, wearing mohair suits and razor-cut hair, were the top group among those who played Le Coq d&#x27;Or, a rowdy establishment at the center of the action on the Yonge Street strip in Toronto. They were able to stay out of most of the bar fights that broke out there almost every night.

Robbie Robertson wrote in his 2016 memoir &quot;Testimony&quot; about how he and his band the Suedes had opened for the Hawks at the Dixie Arena in the west end of Toronto when he was fifteen. He described Hawkins spinning, flipping, and camel walking when Jimmy Ray &quot;Luke&quot; Paulman launched into a solo on his lead guitar, then tumbling and landing at Paulman&#x27;s feet. He said of the show, &quot;It was the most violent, dynamic, primitive rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll I had ever witnessed, and it was addictive.&quot; It was also the first time he saw Levon Helm, whom he described as a &quot;young beam of light on drums&quot; at the center of it all.

The Hawks were playing at Le Coq d&#x27;Or for a couple more weeks, and Robertson hung around them as much as possible, hoping he could absorb some of their southern &quot;mojo&quot;. One afternoon he overheard Hawkins say he needed some new songs since they were going into the studio to record the next month. Hoping to ingratiate himself, Robertson stayed up all night and wrote two songs, &quot;Someone Like You and &quot;Hey Boba Lu&quot;, and played them for Hawkins the next day. The showman was impressed and recorded both of them for his new album, &quot;Mr Dynamo&quot;.

A year later, in 1960, Robertson pawned his prized 1957 Fender Stratocaster to buy a bus ticket south from Toronto to Fayetteville, Arkansas, to audition for a job with Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks, &quot;the most wicked rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band around&quot;. Levon Helm met the guitarist at the Greyhound bus station and initiated him into the ways of the Deep South. This was Robertson&#x27;s first time in the South, and he was hoping to take the place of Fred Carter, Jr., who had played with Hawkins&#x27;s cousin, Dale Hawkins, and Roy Orbison. The band went to Levon Helm&#x27;s home town of Helena in the Mississippi Delta, where Robertson spent some time at the Helms&#x27; family farm.

Then he and Helm returned to the Rainbow Inn, a local motel in which Hawkins had ensconced the band, and practiced songs from the Hawks&#x27; repertoire. The motel was owned by a local ferry operator, Charlie Halbert, who had helped many musicians just starting out in the business, including Conway Twitty and Elvis Presley. When Hawkins offered him the job, Robertson asked how much he would be paid, and Hawkins responded, &quot;Well, son, you won&#x27;t make much money, but you&#x27;ll get more pussy than Frank Sinatra.&quot; Hawkins, with Helm in tow, then went to England to promote his new record, where they met Eddie Cochran and Gene Vincent, who were on tour there. Meanwhile, still at the Rainbow Inn, Robertson tried to learn as much of the band&#x27;s repertoire as he could, in an environment that he recalled as &quot;rockabilly boot camp&quot;.

Before leaving on the trip to England, Hawkins took Robertson to the Delta Supper Club, a notorious hangout in West Helena, where an irate patron had chainsawed the bar down the middle. While waiting for Hawkins&#x27;s and Helm&#x27;s return, Robertson practiced, listening to stacks of records he had bought in Memphis with his first week&#x27;s paycheck. His haul of music included records by Ray Charles, bluesmen Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Muddy Waters, B. B. King, Junior Parker, and T-Bone Walker, rockabilly singer and guitarist Warren Smith, and gospel singer Mahalia Jackson. When Hawkins and his new Hawks lineup recorded the album &quot;Mojo Man&quot; in New York City in 1961, Robertson&#x27;s lead guitar work showed the influence of other Chicago bluesmen such as Buddy Guy and Otis Rush as well.

Along with Helm, all the Hawks left Hawkins in 1964 to form a group which came to be named the Band. Robertson describes an event that led to the parting in chapter nine of &quot;Testimony&quot;. The decision came after Hawkins tried to prevent Rick Danko&#x27;s girlfriend from coming to the shows. Hawkins wanted the group to mingle with the crowd, and Danko wanted to sit with her instead. Other issues included diverging musical interests, and pay. Hawkins was often absent from shows, leaving the Hawks to play without him. Levon felt they should be paid more when Hawkins didn&#x27;t show up. There was a confrontation and things came to a head. They went to work for Bob Dylan in 1965, touring with him for a year, and were his backup band on &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot;. Hawkins continued to perform and record, and did a few tours in Europe.

In December 1969, Hawkins hosted John Lennon and Yoko Ono for a stay at his home in Mississauga, Ontario, during the couple&#x27;s campaign to promote world peace. Lennon signed his erotic &quot;Bag One&quot; lithographs during his stay there. Lennon also did a radio promo for a Hawkins single, a version of The Clovers song &quot;Down in the Alley&quot;. Hawkins later rode with them on a train to Ottawa to see then-prime minister Pierre Trudeau. Lennon also enlisted Hawkins as a peace ambassador, and Hawkins traveled to the border of China and Hong Kong with journalist Ritchie Yorke bearing an anti-war message.

In 1970 Hawkins recorded at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, laying down tracks for an ultimately unproduced album entitled &quot;Ronnie Hawkins&quot;. Among the studio musicians was Duane Allman, whose backing led two tracks from the session to be included on the Duane Allman Anthology - Volume II released in 1974: Carl Perkins&#x27; rockabilly hit &quot;Matchbox&quot;, and the Don Gibson country &amp; western tune &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me Your Troubles&quot;, featuring Allman on dobro. Four more tracks from that album were included on Skydog, a 2016 Duane Allman retrospective: &quot;One More Night,&quot; &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken,&quot; &quot;Down in the Alley,&quot; and &quot;Who Do You Love.&quot; &quot;Matchbox&quot; was also included on Skydog.

In the early 1970s, Hawkins noticed guitarist Pat Travers performing in Ontario nightclubs and was so impressed by the young musician that he invited him to play in his band. Travers joined the group, but balked when Hawkins told him he wanted him to play &quot;old &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s rockabilly tunes&quot;. Years later, Travers told an interviewer, &quot;... he wanted me to play them exactly the same, same sound, same picking, same everything. For a 19-, 20-year-old kid, that wasn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted to do. But he said, &#x27;You can do this, son, and you&#x27;ll be better than a hundred guitar players, because this is where it all comes from. You need to know this stuff. It&#x27;s like fundamental.&#x27; And he was right&quot;. Travers later had a successful recording career and became an influential guitarist in the 1970s hard rock genre.

In 1975, Bob Dylan cast Hawkins to play the role of &quot;Bob Dylan&quot; in the movie, &quot;Renaldo and Clara&quot;. The following year, he was a featured performer at the Band&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day farewell concert at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, which was documented in the 1978 film &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;. Robbie Robertson said of it in 2020, &quot;If there was anything wrong that night, it was that the cocaine wasn&#x27;t very good.&quot; Hawkins sampled some of the powder and told the other performers that there was so much flour and sugar in it that they would be &quot;sneezing biscuits&quot; for three months afterward. Hawkin&#x27;s 1984 LP, &quot;Making It Again&quot;, garnered him a Juno Award as Canada&#x27;s best Country Male Vocalist. In addition to his career as a musician, he become an accomplished actor, hosting his own television show &quot;Honky Tonk&quot; in the early 1980s and appearing in such films as Michael Cimino&#x27;s &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; alongside his friend Kris Kristofferson, and in the action/adventure film &quot;Snake Eater&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=qW8rAUX6yvIC&amp;pg=PA329&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His version of the song &quot;Mary Lou&quot; was used in the 1989 slasher film, &quot;Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II&quot;.

He was profiled in the 1982 television documentary film &quot;The Hawk&quot;, directed by Martin Kahan.

On January 10, 1995, Hawkins celebrated his 60th birthday by sponsoring a concert at Massey Hall in Toronto, which was documented on the album &quot;Let It Rock&quot;. The concert featured performances by Hawkins, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, The Band, and Larry Gowan. Canadian musician Jeff Healey sat in on guitar as well. Hawkins&#x27;s band, the Hawks, or permutations of it, backed the performers. All of the musicians performing that night were collectively dubbed &quot;the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Orchestra&quot;.
==Later life==
In 2002, Hawkins was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer which went into remission, which he attributed in the film documentary to a miracle by the &#x27;Big Rocker&#x27; and Adam &#x27;Dreamhealer&#x27; McLeod, a 16 year old healer from Vancouver, B.C. His remarkable remission was featured in the 2012 film &quot;Ronnie Hawkins: Still Alive and Kicking&quot;. In 2017, he moved from Stoney Lake Manor in Douro-Dummer, where he had resided since 1970, to Peterborough, Ontario.

Hawkins died in the early morning of May 29, 2022, at the age of 87 from unspecified causes. The cancer reportedly had never returned.

He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Wanda, their two sons, Ronnie Hawkins Jr. and singer-songwriter Robin Hawkins, who had served as his guitarist since the 1980s and wrote his hit &#x27;Can&#x27;t Stop Rockin&#x27;, and daughter Leah Hawkins, a singer-songwriter who had been his backup singer, and his grandchildren, Robin&#x27;s four children, Tara, Troy, Jacob and Zack.

<text>Sir Barton (April 26, 1916 – October 30, 1937) was a champion American Thoroughbred racehorse who is the first winner of the American Triple Crown.

==Background==
Sir Barton was a chestnut colt bred in 1916, in Kentucky, by John E. Madden at Hamburg Place Farm near Lexington. An Englishman, Vivian A. Gooch, who judged the 1918 National Horse, was co-listed as breeder with Madden, but Gooch had actually served as the agent who purchased Sir Martin, Sir Barton&#x27;s half-brother, from Madden for Louis Winans. As a favor to Gooch, Madden listed his friend as co-breeder and then Madden purchased Gooch&#x27;s gifted share of Sir Barton when Madden decided to keep the colt and race him under his own colors.

Sir Barton was sired by the British stallion Star Shoot out of the mare Lady Sterling, by Hanover. Sir Barton&#x27;s paternal grandsire was the 1893 English Triple Crown winner Isinglass. His half-brother was 1908 juvenile champion Sir Martin.

Sir Barton was known for being a &quot;grouchy&quot; horse, and it was said that the only human he didn&#x27;t hate was his groom, Toots Thompson.

==Racing career==
===Early career===
Trained by African American former jockey Billy Walker, Sir Barton raced as part of John E. Madden&#x27;s stable in the first four starts of his two-year-old season, but none of those starts demonstrated the same speed and talent the colt would show in his workouts. In late August 1918, Madden sold the horse for a reported $10,000 to Canadian businessman and volunteer naval commander J. K. L. Ross. After some early success, Ross was growing his stable as part of his effort to commit more fully to racing. He owned farms in Vercheres, Quebec, where he established a breeding operation for his Canadian horses; and, in 1919, purchased Bolingbrook near Laurel, Maryland, for training and breeding his American stock.

Ross placed Sir Barton in the hands of trainer H. Guy Bedwell. The colt made two more starts that year, finishing second in his last start, the 1918 Belmont Futurity. He contracted blood poisoning after a stablemate kicked him, opening a significant cut on his left hind leg. Bedwell personally nursed him through the illness, which sidelined Sir Barton for the rest of the year.

===1919: Triple Crown sweep===
At three, Sir Barton won his season debut as a maiden in the Kentucky Derby on May 10, 1919, ridden by jockey Johnny Loftus. Legend holds that he was supposed to be the &quot;rabbit&quot; (pacemaker) for his highly regarded stablemate, the gelding Billy Kelly, but that assumption is only partially true; in reality Sir Barton was regarded at having a better chance of winning the Kentucky Derby than Billy Kelly, owing to both his weight allowance as a maiden as well as the fitness he had demonstrated in the preparations for the Derby. Sir Barton led the field of 12 horses from start to finish, winning the race by five lengths. The next day, Sir Barton was shipped to Baltimore to run in the Preakness Stakes, held only three days later on May 14. In the Preakness, he again led all the way, winning wire-to-wire and beating Eternal by four lengths. He then won the Withers Stakes in New York on May 24 and shortly thereafter completed the first Triple Crown in U.S. history by winning the Belmont Stakes on June 11, setting an American record for the mile and three-eighths race, the distance for the Belmont at the time. Sir Barton&#x27;s four wins were accomplished in a space of just 32 days. He has been retroactively honored as the 1919 Horse of the Year.

===1919: Later three-year-old season===
After his win in the Belmont, Sir Barton&#x27;s next start was the Dwyer Stakes, where he faced Purchase, another highly rated three-year-old trained and owned by Sam Hildreth. On a muddy track, Purchase caught Sir Barton in the final furlong and Sir Barton finished second. After the Dwyer, Sir Barton got a bruised hoof and only returned in mid-September. He did stellar performances in races such as the Maryland Handicap while also turning in a couple of puzzling losses, including the Autumn Handicap. He finished the year with $88,250, finishing just ahead of Man o&#x27; War in money won that year.

===1920: Four-year-old season===
As a four-year-old, Sir Barton won five of his 12 races. On April 24, Sir Barton won the six-furlong Climax Handicap at Havre de Grace Racetrack, defeating stablemate Milkmaid and five other runners. In the Saratoga Handicap, he beat Exterminator. While carrying 133 pounds, Sir Barton set a world record for miles on dirt in winning the August 28 Merchants and Citizens Handicap. His match race on October 12 that year against Man o&#x27; War at Kenilworth Park in Windsor, Ontario, Canada is most remembered. Sir Barton, who suffered from hoof problems throughout his career, was unsuited for Kenilworth&#x27;s hard surface, and was beaten by seven lengths.

==Retirement and stud career==
In early 1921, controversy over H. G. Bedwell&#x27;s support of disgraced jockey Cal Shilling forced Ross to fire Bedwell and to hire Henry McDaniel, a future US Racing Hall of Fame inductee known for training Exterminator as a three-year-old. McDaniel attempted to prepare Sir Barton to race as a five-year-old, but worried that continued training would cause the Triple Crown winner to break down. Ross retired Sir Barton to stud that year and in August 1921 sold the champion to Montfort and B.B. Jones, who brought the chestnut son of Star Shoot to their Audley Farm in Berryville, Virginia, where he remained until 1932. In December 2008, a statue of Sir Barton was unveiled in front of Audley Farm&#x27;s stallion barn. The statue, by American sculptor Jan Woods, was a gift from Erich von Baumbach Jr., whose family has had an association with the farm for thirty years.

Despite a lackluster stud career, Sir Barton sired the 1928 Kentucky Oaks winner and 1928 Champion Three Year Old Filly, Easter Stockings. He also sired Fort Thomas Handicap winner Nellie Custis. After Montfort Jones&#x27; death in 1927, B. B. Jones slowly exited the Thoroughbred racing industry; in 1932, Sir Barton became part of the U.S. Army Remount Service, first at Front Royal, Virginia, and then, later that year, in Fort Robinson, Nebraska. Thoroughbred breeder and rancher J. R. Hylton received Sir Barton from the Remount Service and brought him to his ranch outside of Douglas, Wyoming.

Sir Barton died of colic on October 30, 1937, and was buried on Hylton&#x27;s ranch in the foothills of the Laramie Mountains. In 1968 his remains were moved to Washington Park in Douglas, Wyoming, where a memorial was erected to honor America&#x27;s first Triple Crown winner. Gordon Turner raised money for and orchestrated the move.

==Honors and awards==
Sir Barton was officially recognized as the first Triple Crown winner in 1950 when the title was formally proclaimed by the Thoroughbred Racing Associations and retroactively awarded to horses who had completed the feat in prior years.

Sir Barton and Star Shoot both have streets named in their honor in Lexington, Kentucky, in the Hamburg Pavilion shopping center area. Sir Barton Way runs from Winchester Road to Man O&#x27; War Boulevard; Star Shoot Parkway runs from the shopping center across Sir Barton Way to Liberty Road.

Sir Barton was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1957. In the Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, he is no. 49.

In 2019, the 100th anniversary of Sir Barton&#x27;s Triple Crown win, the book &quot;Sir Barton and the Making of the Triple Crown&quot; was published by the University Press of Kentucky. The book covers Sir Barton&#x27;s life and career in detail.

In 2020, as part of a fundraiser for emergency relief efforts due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a &quot;virtual Kentucky Derby&quot; was held wherein the field included the 13 Triple Crown winners. Sir Barton finished last.

==Breeding==
*Sir Barton was inbred 3 × 4 to Sterling, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

<doc id="481786" wikidata="Q1124647" url="?curid=481786" title="Takeshi's Castle">
<text>is a Japanese game show that aired between 1986 and 1990 on the Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS). It features the Japanese comedian Takeshi Kitano (also known as Beat Takeshi) as a count who sets up difficult physical challenges that players (or a volunteer army) must overcome in order to reach him in his castle.

The show became a cult television hit around the world. It was highly influential on global popular culture, inspiring a genre of game shows involving physical challenges and painful entertainment, as well as other media. On 2 April 2005, a special live &quot;revival&quot; was broadcast for TBS&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebrations. A reboot of the show was released on Amazon Prime Video on 21 April 2023. German-Japanese actor Subaru Kimura joined the returning Tani as co-leader of the contestants.

==Original &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot;==
The original show involved between 86 and 142 contestants whom General Tani (Hayato Tani) &quot;forced&quot; into a series of elimination-style physical challenges, which were similar to those found in &quot;It&#x27;s a Knockout&quot;. At the end of each episode, the contestants who survived all challenges face off directly against Takeshi and his army in one final assault on his castle, with the goal of claiming it for Tani.

The series featured extensive landscaping of a fixed campus at TBS-owned Midoriyama (Green Mountain) Studios in Yokohama, Kanagawa. The setting included large man-made lakes and elaborate permanent obstacles. The final regular episode aired on 14 April 1989, followed by 4 one-off specials up until 19 October 1990. A special revival took place just outside the TBS Building for the network&#x27;s Spring All-Star Thanksgiving Festival on 2 April 2005, featuring Lake of the Dragon God and Gibraltar Strait. In 2004, the website &quot;Takeshi Mania&quot; published an injury list of show participants. The publisher later admitted fabricating the list in an effort to &quot;make a little fun&quot;. While minor injuries were reported, few to no major injuries occurred on the show.

===Challenges===

A wide range of challenges were used throughout the history of &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot;. Depending on their popularity and ease of preparation, some challenges occurred only once or twice, while others took place in virtually every episode. Many challenges involved falling into water or mud upon failure. 

* Border Wall – A tall two-faced soapy slope that contestants need to climb. Several ropes are attached the top, which participants can use to climb. Once a contestant makes it over the wall, they slide down the other side into a small trench of water.
*Wall to Freedom Becomes Far – Contestants face ten gates with eight doors. One or two doors are made of paper, while the remaining doors are blocked by wooden plates or consist of paper with a net behind it. Once contestants make it through the tenth wall, they must sift through a large vat of flour to find a colored tennis ball to win the challenge.
*You Can&#x27;t Continue on an Empty Stomach – Several buns encased in plastic bags are hanging from a rope. To win, contestants must grab onto a bun with their mouth, whilst their arms are affixed to their sides by either an inflatable rubber ring or a large potato sack.
*Boundary Roulette – Contestants must select a disk with various possible descriptions, such as numbers ranging from 0 to 36, &quot;Black,&quot; &quot;Red,&quot; &quot;Odd,&quot; or &quot;Even.&quot; Once selected, they sit down at the corresponding spot of a roulette table. A giant roulette wheel is spun, and the outcome of the spin determines who will be eliminated.
*First Fortress – Contestants must climb an extremely narrow and steep staircase holding water pistols, all while ensuring that a paper ring attached to their helmets remains intact from the Takeshi Gundan, who also have water pistols and targets of their own.
*Devil&#x27;s Domain – A maze composed of either four-sided or six-sided rooms is laid out in a 4x3 rectangle (5x4 when playing with three guards). Contestants navigate the maze while avoiding the guards to reach the goal. Some doors lead to a pool of water that contestants might fall into, constituting a loss.
*Dragon God&#x27;s Pond – Contestants must cross a lake via approximately twenty-five stones. Some of these stones are affixed to the floor of the lake by only a chain, which sinks when stepped on. In early versions, a variation of Wall to Freedom was placed on the other side of the lake. Contestants must choose one of four doors, two of which are made of paper, while the other two are solid. Breaking through a paper door results in a win. 
*Heaven and Hell – Contestants must use a rope to swing across a muddy pit with the goal of landing on a platform. A later version, renamed New Heaven and Hell, required contestants to gain momentum by running down a pathway and then swinging in a semi-circle to land on a platform.
*Beach Boys and Gals – Contestants must ride a surfboard and traverse several obstacles. Originally, contestants jumped over several Styrofoam obstacles (designed to look like an axolotl) and ducked under obstacles (designed to look like a shark&#x27;s mouth). This challenge was later scrapped and reintroduced as Spinning Beach Boys and Gals, which was played several feet above water with a surfboard attached to a rotating arm. The goal was to stay on the surfboard and reach the finish platform, which was made to look like a tropical island.
*Bridge Over The Battlefield – Contestants must push themselves onto a board, then move along a rolling track to reach an arrow at the end. If they push too hard, they will fall off the track into the water. If their push is too soft, they may undershoot the arrow, and a guard will shove them off the track.
*Revolving Comaneci – The contestant must cross two planks rotating counterclockwise, with one side of the field covered by mattresses that will push the contestant off. As a result, contestants need to reach the center of the plank before continuing.
*Boinging Pompokolin – Contestants are attached to a harness above a mud pit and are pulled along a wire in the air. They must then lower themselves to obtain a ball, which can be thrown into a pot at the end of the mud pit.
*Corinth Pon – Contestants are placed into a transparent ball and pushed down a giant pachinko machine. Their goal is to reach the bottom of the board while avoiding the skull boxes scattered along the board, which would constitute a loss.
*Horse Race Challenge – Contestants wear horse costumes with their feet covered by rollerblades. On the General&#x27;s signal, contestants must race to the finish line while overcoming three progressively higher hurdles.
*Hello Mr. Turtle – Contestants must cross ten turtle-shaped platforms to reach the finish. After a while, a guard will begin chasing them in an attempt to push contestants off their platforms.
*Sumo Pon – Five sumo wrestlers are shown to the contestants, who will then draw a ball from a box. The ball&#x27;s color determines who they must defeat in sumo wrestling to win.
*It&#x27;s an Earthquake Grandpa! – While wearing grey wigs and clothing traditionally worn by Japanese elders, contestants must kneel on a pile of foam blocks and maintain their positions while a small earthquake is simulated in the room.
*Runaway Train of Death – Contestants sit on a mat and are pushed down a sloped track into water. Their aim is to jump onto a lily pad at the sides: a large wobbly one on the left and a smaller but more stable one on the right.
*Thud Calligraphy – Contestants must fire a crossbow onto a small wheel, which determines the Japanese character they need to draw. Using an oversized brush, they have 30 seconds to draw their character on the designated area of a wet slope.
*Adventure Zone – Contestants must overcome an obstacle course akin to a video game while a robot on top of the background structure moves along. Contestants are victorious if they reach the end of the course unless the aforementioned robot finishes first. Should this happen, the contestant is disqualified, and a guard usually throws them into water.
*The Longest Yard – Contestants must carry a football across a playing field while defenders wearing large foam football costumes try to prevent them from doing so. If a contestant is pinned to the ground by a defenders, they lose the round.
*Daruma-San has Fallen Down – Based on a well-known Japanese children&#x27;s game, contestants must climb a hill while wearing oversized daruma costumes. A guard waits at the top of the hill. His back is turned to the contestants while he chants &quot;だるまさんがころんだ&quot;!After finishing his chant, he turns around. Contestants are disqualified if the guard spots them moving or if they fall down the hill. Reaching the top of the hill signifies victory.
*Flat Chest – While wearing a white bodysuit with velcro on the front, contestants must swing over a lake to stick onto a Velcro wall on the other side.
*Condor Takes Flight – Wearing an oversized hawk costume, contestants are led down a zipline above the ground. Their goal is to catch a plush rabbit midway through with their feet, then throw it onto the nest at the end of the track.
*Roller Game – Contestants must cross a large pond by running over seven rolling pins placed at uneven heights. These pins rotate on an axis, making it difficult for contestants to keep them stationary.
*You Can&#x27;t Save the Ball – Contestants knock a ball into a giant pachinko machine. They must then grab a bowl, run down a staircase, and wait on a narrow ledge for the ball to reach them, while General Tani gives them directions on where the ball is at the moment. As the ball arrives, they jump into a mud pit to catch it in their bowl.
*Study the Cards Game – While wearing oversized hand costumes, five contestants compete against five of Takeshi&#x27;s Gundan. At the start of each round, Michiru Jo recites a mathematical problem or a question with a numerical answer. Contestants must determine the correct answer and then fall onto it.
*You Too are Masaru Uno-Kid – While wearing oversized baseball player costumes, contestants must catch a baseball that is being batted in the air. This game is played multiple times with the same group.
*Aquatic Volleyball – Contestants must score three points in a game of volleyball against their opponents. The game takes place on a mat floating on water. They may be faced with three possible opponents: Takeshi&#x27;s guards, a female volleyball team, or women in swimwear.
* Straits of Gibraltar – General Tani fires a black ball at the contestants, who are standing on a wobbly bridge. Once they catch the ball, the contestants must traverse across the bridge while Takeshi&#x27;s Gundan fire cannonballs at them. If they successfully catch a golden ball and reach the other side, they receive 1,000 yen.
*You! Sound That Bell! – Contestants are sitting on a mat, then are pushed down a track into the water, with a slanted platform in the center. Once the platform is reached, the contestant must climb the slope in order to ring a bell at the top.
*Gah! I Don&#x27;t Know! – Contestants sit on a circular disc on a rolling track. They are pushed down the track and shown several signs forming a mathematical problem. When they reach the end of the track, they must state the solution aloud. Answering incorrectly or failing to give an answer causes the end of the track to collapse, dropping the contestant into a tub of flour or, in later versions, mud.
*Star Bowling – Contestants must pick one of ten playing cards (numbered 1 through 10) to determine their position. Contestants are then placed into oversized bowling pin costumes with their ankles taped together. They must remain standing while a large foam bowling ball is rolled at them. If a contestant falls over, they lose.
*Hell Pull – Contestants choose one of five colored ropes, the ends of which are obstructed by a large wall. Contestants will then enter a game with whoever or whatever is holding the opposite end of their rope.
*Ball Run – Contestants must climb a steep slope while Takeshi&#x27;s guards roll down differently-sized boulders. They can use several gaps in the walls to avoid them, but using a gap causes it to close.
*Stab and Be Stabbed – In a challenge modeled after the popular children&#x27;s game Pop-up Pirate, contestants sit on a giant barrel and select one of six slots. Michiru Jo slides a sword into the selected slot. Choosing one of the two trapped slots will cause the barrel&#x27;s top to tip over, which forces the contestant to slide down a slope into a pond. The goal is to pick three slots correctly (four in its first-ever playing).
*Pie Hit Ending – First contestants must throw a die, determined how far away they will be from a series of six holes, which they need to stick their head out of. Once they are settled in, a professional will throw a pie at them, with the contestant winning if the pie misses.
*Ladder Lottery of Difficult Times – Contestants must choose one of five doors, then follow the path until they reach a junction akin to a ghost leg. Once they reach the end of the path, they must climb a set of stairs and descend down a slide. If they choose the correct slide, they will slide into safety. An incorrect choice drops them into mud.
*Combinations of Love – Played in pairs, contestants must choose between even or odd. While wearing oversized dice costumes, they are rolled down a slope one at a time, and the sum of the two dice rolls must correspond with whichever option the couple chose at the beginning.
*You Jumped, Congratulations! – Contestants must pole vault over a pond from a high platform to land onto a small platform.
*Dash Over the Mud, Youth – Simulating a baseball game, the pitcher throws a ball that the batter purposely misses. Once the catcher catches the ball, contestants must run from first to second base while traversing a large strand of mud to avoid being tagged out.
*Rush Out, Youth! – Contestants wait behind saloon doors in front of a mud pit. On the General&#x27;s whistle, Michiru Jo shoots a soccer ball in the air, and the contestants must run into the mud pit to catch the ball.
*Man Eating Holes – The penultimate challenge for most of the series run. The contestants must jump into one of five large holes in the ground, two of which are being guarded by either Makoto Dainenji or Katsuo Tokashiki, and the last three leading to Takeshi&#x27;s castle. Usually, Dainenji and Tokashiki are dressed in costumes and perform a skit prior to the game&#x27;s start.

=== Final Battle ===
In early episodes, the contestants stormed the castle in a short-range water gun assault. Later episodes introduced carts with paper rings and eventually lasers and light-sensitive targets. If the contestant&#x27;s gun penetrated the paper ring or hit the sensor on Takeshi&#x27;s cart (which was defended by weapons such as a large water gun and a laser-armed plane), Takeshi&#x27;s cart would deactivate, and the castle was &quot;taken,&quot; and the game won. During the water-gun version, if Takeshi was defeated, all surviving players split the prize between them. In the laser-gun version, the player who stopped Takeshi won 1 million yen (which, at the time, was roughly equivalent to US$8,000 or £5,000 sterling).

In the Amazon Prime reboot, the finale game &quot;Yabusame&quot; had the remaining contestants playing against BANANAMAN, Lord Ueda, Lord Neomi, Lord Watanabe, and kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa, who played on Count Takeshi&#x27;s behalf. The contestant rides across a track in a pod firing tennis balls into the funnel of their opponent&#x27;s pod. The defender of the castle shoots back at the paper target on the contestant&#x27;s pod with larger balls. If the castle defender breaks the contestant&#x27;s paper target, the contestant is out. If a player lands a ball in the funnel of the defender, the contestant wins a million yen. If nobody is defeated, it is considered a draw with no victories.

===Character counterparts===
==International versions==
===Arab countries===
In Arab countries the show was called Al Hisn (). It originally aired in the mid to late 1980s where it became a cult hit. The show was syndicated to multiple TV stations across different countries, which was a common practice at the time for localized foreign programs. Various public stations re-run the show on non-specific occasions. Other than the voice-over commentary and the opening/closing themes, the episodes were largely retained as originally aired in Japan. The commentary was provided by Lebanese television personality Riad Sharara (), then later by Jamal Rayyan (), who became a news broadcaster in Al Jazeera&#x27;s Arabic TV news channel. The Arabic version was produced and distributed by Amman-based company Middle East Art Production and Distribution ().

In 2017 the Saudi Arabian Sports Authority Signed a contract with TBS to build a Saudi-inspired Takeshi&#x27;s castle in Riyadh, the first episode of which aired on 25 September 2019 on MBC 1.

===Australia===
An edit of the show was produced by The Comedy Channel. It had hosts in the local studio and was redubbed. This has since been cancelled and/or finished. The show was hosted by two housemates from series two of Australian &quot;Big Brother&quot; Shannon Cleary and Nathan Morris. It also featured a crossdressing Geisha girl named Beryl. Some episodes featured a special guest third host, including Greg Fleet. Highlights appeared in Australia on the television program &quot;World&#x27;s Weirdest TV&quot;. The American version &quot;MXC&quot; currently airs on Fox8 (an Australian cable network). The Australian writer and critic Clive James was once a celebrity contestant on the original show.

===Brazil===
Starting on November 19, 1989, a version was aired by Rede Globo, called Olimpíadas do Faustão (Portuguese for &quot;Faustão&#x27;s Olympics&quot;), as an insert in Fausto Silva&#x27;s Sunday-afternoon variety show &quot;Domingão do Faustão&quot;. In 1994, rival SBT copied that version, and a legal action by Globo and SBT stopped the broadcasting. On June 1, 2008, SBT Keshi remake reappeared on TV, now licensed, remaking Faustão&#x27;s known games (as Bridge Ball and The Run Way), not-seen in Globo games (as Skittles and Ride the Wave), and original games (cross a balance beam after spin, or cross a small bridge using a crank-kart). The games are a segment named &quot;Gincana&quot; in the &quot;Programa Silvio Santos&quot;.

===Czech Republic===
It was shown by the name &quot;Takešiho hrad&quot; (Czech), with comedic voice-over by two Czech comedians. The commentary was mostly fictional. The show was popular among young viewers. The Czech TV channel also broadcast the show to Slovak Republic where it gained some popularity as well. In 2011 was &quot;Takešiho hrad&quot; broadcast on channel Prima Cool with a new single-voice commentary.

===Denmark===
The Danish TV station TV 2 Zulu bought the rights to air the Challenge version in Denmark, thus making the Danish broadcast identical to that in Britain.

===Finland===
On 7 January 2008, the television channel Jim started airing the UK version of the program. The comments are subtitled in Finnish. The show is titled Hullut japanilaiset &quot;(The Crazy Japanese)&quot;

===France===
A shortened version given a comedic voiceover by comedians Vincent Desagnat and Benjamin Morgaine has been shown on the W9 TV channel since October 2006, in a program called &quot;Menu W9&quot; (which also presented a shortened version of &quot;Sushi TV&quot; on its first season, now replaced by &quot;Sasuke&quot;). It has been also broadcast on the channel M6 which shown 2 episodes per day at 6.50 p.m from Tuesday to Friday. The voices were those of the late sport presenter Thierry Roland and Moon Dailly.

===Germany===
A dubbed version of the show aired on DSF in 1999. This version was released on a DVD box set with 12 selected episodes. Two more volumes were planned but were presumably canceled. A German dubbed version of the 2002 UK edit airs from 3 July 2007, on RTL II. There also exists an adaptation called &quot;Entern oder Kentern&quot; (engl.: Board or Capsize) with almost the same games but pirates as antagonists and celebrities as Team Captains.

===Greece===
A version aired from 2005 to 2009 on Skai TV by the name &quot;Το κάστρο του Τακέσι&quot; (Takeshi&#x27;s Castle). It has been dubbed by Kostas Papageorgiou and Akindynos Gkikas.

===Hungary===
In early 2022, the Hungarian version of Comedy Central started to broadcast the Indonesian show, redubbed with stand-up comedians Péter Elek and Péter Janklovics who tend to know nothing about the aim of the game, thus strengthen the funny circumstances of the show just like in the Czech version. However, after the premiere, repeats are aired in CET nighttime only.

===India===
A shortened version of the show aired on Pogo on March 1, 2005, with Hindi commentary by Jaaved Jaaferi. Jaaferi&#x27;s commentary was praised for its humour, and this increased the show&#x27;s popularity. It additionally featured guest commentators such as Raju Srivastav, Sunil Pal, Navin Prabhakar, and Ahsaan Qureshi. The show aired on Pogo until 2019.

Amazon Prime Video&#x27;s 2023 reboot of &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; was released on November 2, 2023, featuring the voice of Bhuvan Bam as his character &quot;Titu Mama&quot; from &quot;BB Ki Vines&quot;, taking over as the new commentator, replacing Jaaved Jaaferi. Bhuvan spent four months dubbing and writing the script for the show, with some promotional videos filmed in September.

===Indonesia===
The original Japanese show was being re-broadcast (with Indonesian dubs) on RCTI from 1991 to 1996, TPI from 2002 to 2007 and GTV in 2013 and 2014. In 2017, MNCTV acquired the license to remake the show which was later known as Takeshi&#x27;s Castle Indonesia (a.k.a. Benteng Takeshi Indonesia) with a grand prize of IDR 100.000.000,-. After two successful seasons, the show was originally planned to enter its third season in 2018; however, due to a drug case involving Reza Bukan (the cast of King Takeshi at that time) the launch of the third season was delayed until mid-2019.

The main cast of &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle Indonesia&quot; includes Fero Walandouw (as the Captain), Nabila Putri, Poppy Sovia, and Desy JKT48 (as Vice-Captains in Season 1, 2, and 3 respectively), Lee Jong Hoon (as the Reporter), and Reza Bukan and Kenta (as King Takeshi in season 1–2 and 3 respectively).

===Iran===
It was aired by the name &quot;Masir-e Talaa&#x27;ee&quot; () (when translated it means &quot;Golden Path&quot;), on Iran&#x27;s Channel 3 in 2009 and 2010. It was hosted by Morteza and Mostafa Hosseini, the brothers of the refugee host Mohammad Hosseini.

===Italy===
Renamed Mai dire Banzai (Never Say: Banzai!) it first aired in 1989 on Italia 1. A reedited version interspersed with clips of another Japanese gameshow called &quot;Za Gaman&quot;, it was given a comedic voiceover by Gialappa&#x27;s Band, who changed Kitano&#x27;s and Saburo Ishikura&#x27;s names to Gennaro Olivieri and Guido Pancaldi, historically Swiss Italian judges in &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot;. They also renamed in absurdist comical ways the other figures of the show like calling the in-game reporter &#x27;Pokoto Pokoto&#x27;, the martially-attire&#x27;d host &#x27;General Putzersthoefen&#x27; and so on. Gialappa&#x27;s Band making fun of the duty-bound, stoic stereotype of Japan, described the games and tasks as traditional Japanese past-times and thus rather mundane and humdrum by Japanese standards, introducing a veil of non-sequitur to the show which is lacking in English language versions.

The show gained new popularity in the 2000s, when it started being broadcast on various satellite and terrestrial channels with the original title and using the half-hour episodes of the UK shortened version, with independent voiceover (superimposed to the still audible Japanese track) done by various Italian comedians. As of 2008, this version is broadcast on GXT with the voiceover done by Trio Medusa (previously the show was commentated on by Marco Marzocca with Stefano Sarcinelli and still before by duo Lillo &amp; Greg); shortly after it was re-aired by local broadcasters and by K2. From January 10, 2011, the series is re-transmitted in Italy on Cartoon Network and the voiceover is done by Roberto Stocchi and Francesca Draghetti.

===Lithuania===
The show was aired by the name &quot;Takeši pilis&quot;, featuring Fumito Tomoi (a Japanese person living in Lithuania at the time), who dubbed the show in a comic way with his broken Lithuanian. The show was very popular.

===Malaysia===
The Japanese version was aired over NTV7 in early 2000s, although edited to be shortened to half an hour. The broadcast was added with Malay overdub commentary (the original Japanese audio track is still audible in background). Sometimes in earlier versions, the parts that were not overdubbed are subtitled in Malay. The show was known as &quot;Istana Takeshi&quot; in Malaysia.

As of June 2010, the show is airing again using the American version with Malay subtitles on TV9 but still called Istana Takeshi instead of &quot;MXC&quot;, but as 2024 TV3 airing American version with Malay subtitles on 5.30pm Malaysia time.

===Mexico===
The Japanese version on Azteca 13 of TV Azteca in 1993 and Azteca 7 of TV Azteca was aired in Mexico, which, like the Spanish, has its own stories and invented by giving voices teams.

Due to the success of the American edits of &quot;Banzuke&quot; and &quot;Ninja Warrior&quot;/&quot;Sasuke&quot; on Azteca 7, on May 4, 2015, the program was broadcast by Canal 5 of Televisa, under the name &quot;Castillo Takeshi&quot; and narrated by two presenters from Televisa using the British edit as basis for their own edit. Possibly due to the upscaling from PAL to HD, it had a poor quality image, making it look even older than it was. It took the time slot where ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wipeout&quot; had been broadcast since 2014. After just three weeks, the show was replaced by ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wipeout&quot;, which has had a longer more successful run on Mexican TV.

===Netherlands===
The British cut of the show aired on August 15, 2009, on Comedy Central, with Dutch voice-over provided by sports commentator Ronald van Dam and actor/comedian Ruben van der Meer.

&quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle Thailand&quot; in its UK format commenced airing on March 22, 2018, with commentary by actress/singer Katja Schuurman and vocalist Pepijn Lanen.

===Philippines===
It was first shown on IBC in 1990 as a Filipino-dubbed show. Later episodes contained interludes shot on a studio with actors Anjo Yllana as Takesh and Smokey Manoloto as &quot;Iwakura&quot; providing the commentary with a gravelly Japanese accent, which was later dropped in favor of their natural voices. The Filipino production crew also developed on their relationship, with Iwakura often trying to trick Takeshi on several occasions. One episode which resulted in the contestants&#x27; victory was even written as Takeshi&#x27;s worst nightmare; when Iwakura finally wakes him up, Takeshi is so traumatized that he asks to call off a scheduled taping. Makers of the malt drink brand Ovaltine created an in-show mini contest as part of a product endorsement deal in 1991. In this version, the names given to most of the challenges are translated from their original Japanese such as &quot;Devil&#x27;s Maze&quot; for the Honeycomb and Square Mazes, &quot;Flying Mushroom&quot; for Mushroom Trip, and &quot;Sumo Wrestling&quot; for Sumo Rings.

The IBC episodes of &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; were later rerun on SBN during 1993 and 1994. The show was not edited as before at IBC.

&quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; enjoyed a revival in the Philippines on October 2, 2006. This time around, comedians Joey de Leon and Ryan Yllana (Anjo&#x27;s younger brother) provide the commentary as fictional characters shogun Shintaro &quot;Taru&quot; Gokoyami who is Takeshi&#x27;s right-hand man and sumo wrestler Kakawate Takehome, the leader of the Takeshi Gundan, fictional in the sense that there are no such characters in the original cast. Initially, the two provide play-by-play commentary, but they as well as some added characters reduced themselves to skits and commentary in between clips of the show. Later, as part of Q&#x27;s first anniversary, Anjo finally appeared alongside the new cast, reprising his role as &quot;prince&quot; Takeshi.

Due to Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&#x27;s competitive ratings, the management of GMA Network decided to move the show from QTV in an evening slot, now to the early afternoon weekend slot of GMA. &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; was aired on a weekly basis as opposed to the weekdays airing on Q, and was aired before &quot;Eat Bulaga&quot; on Saturdays and before &quot;SOP&quot; on Sundays. This was done to increase and improve the ratings of the succeeding shows. &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; started to air on GMA on December 23, 2006, with same hosts. The show aired its last episode on May 9, 2007, and after a long break of TV experience, Joey and Ryan assumed new personalities as Master GT (later Tirso Potter) and Captain B respectively. It was temporarily replaced by &quot;Just Joking&quot; which starred also Joey De Leon and Ryan Yllana and other casts. On August 13, 2007, &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; returned on air once again with all new episodes and Mike &quot;Pekto&quot; Nacua (Cookie), John Feir (Belli) and Love Añover (replacement when either Cookie or Belli was not in) become commentators. The show aired at Saturdays 11:30 a.m. before &quot;Eat Bulaga!&quot;, and Sundays 11:15 a.m. before &quot;SOP Rules&quot;.

On GMA&#x27;s regional networks, a Cebuano-dubbed show aired on GMA Cebu and Davao from Saturdays and Sundays in the morning titled &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle Wala Gyud sa Isaysay Banzai!&quot; (Never Say Banzai!).

===Portugal===
A version called Nunca Digas Banzai (Portuguese for &quot;Never Say Banzai&quot;, based on the Italian name for it, Mai Dire Banzai) aired on SIC starting in 1994, where it reached some popularity. Voiceovers were provided by two hosts, José Carlos Malato and João Carlos Vaz. Takeshi and Ishikura were renamed &quot;Fujimoto&quot; and &quot;Fujicarro&quot; (a play on the Portuguese words for &quot;[motor]bike&quot; and &quot;car&quot; using the Japanese word ), and the Portuguese hosts made no attempt to interpret the reality of the show, instead using the contestants as surrogates for the satirical comments about Portuguese public figures, in a similar style to &quot;MXC&quot;.

===Russia===
The series were featured in Ren TV project show &quot;The Best Shows of the World&quot; (Лучшие шоу мира) in the early 2000s and due to positive public reaction were aired on the regular basis on its own, named &quot;Takeshi Kitano&#x27;s Castle&quot; (Замок Такеши Китано). Show was translated and aired on 2x2 channel as &quot;Japanese amusements&quot; (Японские забавы) during 2011–2012 and again in 2013 and 2014. The format of the show is the translated commentary version of UK adaptation.

Secondly, in 2020 – show &quot;Gold of Gelendzhik&quot; (Золото Геленджика) aired on ТНТ channel, based on &quot;Takeshi Kitano&#x27;s Castle&quot; format. The action of this show takes place in the resort town of Gelendzhik in the Krasnodar Territory on the Black Sea coast. The rules of the game and challenges are similar to the original Japanese show, but with some changes, in particular, the Final Challenge was borrowed from another Japanese show in which participants need to climb slippery stairs and take prize.

===Serbia===
Show started with showing on FOX TV in January 2010 named &quot;Takeši&quot;.

===Singapore===
The show debuted in 1993 on Singapore&#x27;s free-to-air channel, Channel 8.

===Slovakia===
During 2011 and 2012, it was Takešiho hrad broadcast on channel Joj Plus with a single-voice Slovak commentary.

===South Africa===
The show was broadcast daily on the Sony MAX channel, Channel 128 on DStv. It was the condensed version of the original series with commentary provided by Craig Charles. It began broadcasting in 2009 and was a huge hit with viewers. Due to its popularity the show has been aired to a broader audience on SABC 2.

===Spain===
The program aired in the 1990s as Humor amarillo (when translated it means &quot;Yellow Humour&quot; or &quot;Yellow Comedy&quot;) on TV channel Telecinco. Comedians Juan Herrera and Miguel Ángel Coll (son of José Luis Coll) commented on the images; this version of the show has achieved cult status and there are some fansites and web petitions for returns. In fact, the Spanish version created some terms now familiar to either &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; or &quot;Humor amarillo&quot;, like &quot;El Laberinto del Chinotauro&quot; (literally &quot;The Chinesetaur Labyrinth&quot;, name for any of the maze challenges), &quot;Los Cañones de Nakasone&quot; (parody of &quot;Guns of Navarone&quot; Spanish title), &quot;Las Zamburguesas&quot; (for Skipping Stones),&quot;Gacela Thompson&quot; (&quot;Thompson Gazelle&quot;), a pathetic businessman character, and &quot;Chino Cudeiro&quot; (the Chinese Cudeiro, as the name started to be assigned when appeared a player with a red T-shirt with the inscription &quot;Cudeiro, Galicia, España&quot;), the name assigned to a random player that always &quot;dies&quot;, one of the most popular characters in Spain.

On January 28, 2006, a second version dubbed by Fernando Costilla and Paco Bravo premiered on Spanish TV channel Cuatro. They have shown every one of the original Japanese episodes, with the last one being shown on June 9, 2007, ending with a special message by the Spanish commentators. The 2006 version is currently being rebroadcast on the Telecinco-owned channel Energy.

These two versions had in common that it was naturally assumed that the dubbing was completely unrelated to the original dialogues, to the point that sometimes the references to the actual contest were really few. The commentators could turn the contestants into mushroom seekers, or people looking for a new apartment. Alongside the spectacular hits suffered by the contestants and the show&#x27;s peculiar aesthetic, this helped boost its popularity.

===Taiwan===
A version called &quot;100 Wars, 100 Victories&quot; () on CTS and was based on the original series. It featured four teams competing for small prizes in games.

===Thailand===
&quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; was dubbed and shown on Channel 5 between 1988 and 1995. The title was changed to &quot;Hod, Mun, Ha&quot; (โหด มัน ฮา), or &quot;Cruel, Thrilling, Fun&quot;.

In 2007, the unedited original series with bilingual soundtrack (Thai &amp; Japanese) was aired on X-ZYTE channel on TrueVisions cable TV every Sunday and rerun several times throughout a week.

In 2014, Channel 7 (Thailand) and Heliconia H Group bought the rights to remake the show. &quot;โหด มัน ฮา Takeshi&#x27;s Castle Thailand&quot; first aired on 20 July, with a new episode airing most Sundays. The show&#x27;s format is identical to the one used in the original show, but with a few minor changes. Shogun Takeshi (Note Chernyim) has kept Princess Woosenko (Woonsen Virithipa Pakdeeprasong) as a prisoner in his castle. General Shahkrit (Shahkrit Yamnarm) attempts to rescue the princess from the castle by sending his army of contestants through Shogun&#x27;s challenges (remade challenges include Slippery Wall, Avalanche, Honeycomb Maze, Skipping Stones, Slip Way, Sumo Rings, Wet Paint, and Tug Of War), and the last remaining contestants battle against Shogun&#x27;s guards in the Showdown. Any winners receive the 1,000,000 Thai-baht cash prize, the cash prize is rolled over to the next episode if there are no winners.

Later on, the show reduced the number of competitors to 20, and then 12 in current shows. With the rules format changing, the competitors don&#x27;t get eliminated throughout the show, but instead work as a team. The competitors are given, by Shogun Takeshi, 10 carts and the Shogun has no guard carts at the beginning of the episode. The competitors then play 5 challenges before the Showdown. In the first challenge, usually involved all the competitors playing at the same time, every single competitors must pass the challenge, while the subsequent challenges needs at most 5 passes to be credited as a win. Winning a challenge will cause the situation remaining unchanged, while losing the first challenge takes one cart away from the competitors team and one cart added to Shogun&#x27;s team in Showdown. In subsequent challenges, one car is taken away and added to Shogun&#x27;s team if less than 5 competitors passed, two cars are taken if less than 3 competitors passed. In current shows, with 12 competitors, two cars are taken away if less than 3 competitors passed, while 3 passes are credit with a win, and no cars are taken away. Losing a challenge also results in a punishment for the competitors in various ways, usually messy and painful. In Showdown, the team sends out two competitors per one cart they have to battle with Shogun&#x27;s guards. Succeeding in Battle awards all competitors a share of 5,000,000 baht cash prize, but the prize is remain the same in all episodes.

===Turkey===
The Turkish version of the show was in development.

===Ukraine===
The show was aired on QTV channel as &quot;Laughter with Takeshi Kitano&quot; (Реготня з Такеші Кітано) during 2008–2010.

===United Kingdom===

====&quot;Tarrant on TV&quot; (late 1980s)====
The show was first introduced to British audiences in the late 1980s, when it was featured semi-regularly as part of LWT&#x27;s &quot;Tarrant on TV&quot;, in which broadcaster Chris Tarrant showcased a variety of unusual television programmes from around the world. One of the series&#x27; previous hosts, Clive James, appeared in an original Japanese episode as an international contestant – with behind the scenes footage shown as part of his two-part ITV documentary &quot;...in Japan&quot; in 1987.

====Challenge version (2002–2004)====
&quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; would become better known later when a condensed version of the original series, commentated by Craig Charles, premiered on Challenge on November 9, 2002, regularly dominating the top ten programmes on the channel each week.

The UK format did not follow the original Japanese format – instead presenting each sequence of games as comic martial challenges leading to the final game wherein remaining contestants tried to storm the Castle. A typical episode of the Challenge format of &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; had about eight games, followed by the Final Showdown. After each challenge, a &#x27;Ridiculous Replay&#x27; was shown, highlighting the most entertaining attempt. Challenge edited out the comedy sketches in the original Japanese version to allow more games to be shown during the half-hour block. During the series, Charles coined the term &quot;Keshi Heads&quot; to describe avid fans of the show.

More series were commissioned and shown over the next few months, culminating in a series of hour-long specials in the Autumn of 2003, and a special highlights show, &quot;The A-Z of Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot;, broadcast on January 1, 2004, which showed some of the best clips of the best games as the last original series finale. On September 3, 2005, &quot;MXC&quot; aired for the first time in the UK on Challenge.

On May 9, 2007, &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot; had their own mini &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; challenge, including &#x27;Knock Knock&#x27;, &#x27;Bite the Bun&#x27;, a &quot;Bridge Ball&quot; adaptation called &#x27;Balancing Act&#x27; and the &#x27;Slippery Wall&#x27;. The UK TV series returned to Challenge after a hiatus on September 7, 2009 with a modified opening sequence (to fit with Flextech rebranding to Virgin Media Television).

====&quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle Rebooted&quot; (2013)====
In February 2010, a campaign was launched by fansite Keshi Heads in an attempt to bring a brand new series of &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; to Challenge within its tenth anniversary year on the channel (November 2012–13). It was suggested by campaigners that these new episodes would feature never-before-seen games (previously completely cut from other episodes), and feature five Japanese episodes new to the UK, including the Pilot and an International Special which have never been seen on TV since their original airings in Japan.

On December 13, 2012, Challenge announced that they had signed a deal for &quot;unseen bits of Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot;. The new series, named &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle Rebooted&quot;, which aired from March 8 to 29, 2013, featured games and episodes suggested by the Keshi Heads website in their campaign. Despite Craig Charles agreeing to return for the new series, Challenge brought in Richard McCourt and Dominic Wood (Dick and Dom) as the new voiceovers. Hayato Tani also filmed presentation links for the new series.

====Comedy Central revival (2017-20)====
A new series of &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; aired on Comedy Central, initially with Jonathan Ross as voiceover. This version used footage from the Thailand series, and later the Indonesian version. Ross was later replaced by Roman Kemp as host in 2018, with Martin Kemp, Chris Hughes, Georgia Toffolo, Georgia Kousoulou, Tommy Mallett and Vick Hope as guest co-hosts for one week each, this time visible in the corner of the screen. Kemp was followed by Guz Khan in 2019, with guests including Basil Brush and Joey Essex, and then Stephen Bailey in 2020 for the Indonesian version of the show, with guests Chris Kamara, Joey Essex, Scarlett Moffatt, Basil Brush, Judi Love, Charlotte Dawson, Matt Richardson and Ollie Locke.

==== &quot;Romesh and Tom Take Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; (2023) ====
The British version of the 2023 reboot of the show, named &quot;Romesh and Tom Take Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot;, was commentated by Romesh Ranganathan and Tom Davis, and was released on Amazon Prime Video on 30 August that year. This was the first British version of the show that displayed full episodes of the Japanese show with its original format and graphics, as well as full player introductions.

===United States===

In the United States, &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; was utilized as the video footage for the show &quot;MXC&quot; (subtitled &quot;Most Extreme Elimination Challenge&quot;) on Spike TV, which substituted the original audio with comical dubbing and commentary in English which is completely unrelated to the original dialogue and story of Takeshi&#x27;s Castle. The show has also been broadcast in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The Thailand and Indonesian versions of the show, using the Comedy Central UK dub, aired in the US on G4, starting in late 2021.

Two attempts were made to Americanize the format:

*On July 28, 1990, Fox aired a special half-hour version of the original show premise entitled &quot;King of the Mountain&quot; which was packaged by Fox Square Productions and was hosted by John Mulrooney and Judy Toll. This version used the same games, but had only 10 competitors and no costumed characters to impede the players&#x27; progress. This American attempt only taped two pilots (one on July 24, 1988), and only the aforementioned was aired. Footage from both of these pilots were used in episode 106 of Takeshi&#x27;s Castle.
*On June 16, 1993, CBS aired the second attempt, entitled &quot;Storm the Castle&quot;. This hour-long version, which was packaged by Vin Di Bona Productions and hosted by Michael Burger and Nely Galán, pitted 30 families against each other and against well-known monsters (such as Beetlejuice) in a quest to win $15,000. Unlike &quot;Mountain&quot;, &quot;Storm&quot; had some exclusive games not seen anywhere else. &quot;Storm&quot;, like &quot;Mountain&quot;, only lasted a single special. Future NFL player Christian Fauria appeared with his family as contestants.

===Vietnam===
The Vietnamese show &quot;Đại Náo Thành Takeshi&quot; produced under license, with the first episode airing March 25, 2017 in primetime on VTV3. The program features famous Vietnamese artists, with warlords Takeshi played by Trấn Thành and Sharkito by Trương Thế Vinh, and Princess Woonsenko played by Diễm My 9X. Challenges in the first episode included Slippery Wall, Slip Way, Honeycomb Maze, and Final Fall. The Show Down in front of the castle takes place in boats equipped with water spray nozzle weapons and paper disc targets. After the airing of the 13 episodes filmed, the show was generally criticized by the lack of creativity of the hosts and other factors.

==Cultural impact==
&quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; was highly influential on popular culture around the world, inspiring a genre of game shows involving physical challenges and painful entertainment. The physical challenge game show format of &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; has inspired numerous game shows internationally, with popular examples including &quot;Sasuke&quot; (&quot;Ninja Warrior&quot;), &quot;American Ninja Warrior&quot;, &quot;Ninja Warrior UK&quot;, &quot;Wipeout&quot;, &quot;Total Wipeout&quot;, &quot;Hole in the Wall&quot;, and &quot;Ultimate Beastmaster&quot;. The reality television franchise &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; also incorporates &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; like physical challenges. British comedian Alex Horne has said &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; was one of the inspirations for &quot;Taskmaster&quot;. Stuart Heritage of &quot;The Guardian&quot; argues that the Tough Mudder endurance events may have also been inspired by &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot;.

&quot;British GQ&quot; compared the &quot;silly sets and close awkwardness&quot; of &quot;Floor Is Lava&quot; (2020) to &quot;the belly-laugh slapstick of Japanese game shows&quot; such as &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot;. The 2021 game show &quot;Frogger&quot;, based on Konami&#x27;s 1981 arcade game of the same name, has also drawn comparisons to &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot;. In 2023, &quot;The Guardian&quot; argued that the video game &quot;Fall Guys&quot; was &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle in all but name.&quot;

In a 2021 &quot;LADbible&quot; poll, &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; was voted the classic UK TV game show that audiences miss the most. In 2023, there was nostalgia for &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; in Japan.

===Other media===
A Nintendo Famicom (NES) game with the same name was released in 1987 by Bandai. It required the use of the Family Trainer (Power Pad) to play its eight challenges. It was played on the twelfth episode of GameCenter CX. A sequel called &quot;Fūun! Takeshi Jō Two&quot; was released in 1988 with different challenges.

A J2ME mobile game based on the second Spanish language dubbed version of Takeshi&#x27;s Castle, called Humor Amarillo: El Juego-Móvil was developed and released by Gameloft in 2008.

The casting of Takeshi Kitano in the 2000 Japanese film &quot;Battle Royale&quot; was a reference to his earlier role as the host of &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot;, to add a sense of potential realism to the film&#x27;s extreme battle royale game show concept.

Video game developer Mediatonic cited &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot; as an inspiration behind the popular battle royale game &quot;Fall Guys&quot; (2020).

<text>Barbara Hendricks (born November 20, 1948) is an American operatic soprano and concert singer. Hendricks has lived in Europe since 1977, and in Switzerland in Basel since 1985. She is a citizen of Sweden following her marriage to a Swedish citizen.

==Early life and education==
Hendricks was born in Stephens, Arkansas. Growing up, she sang and took voice lessons and was often asked to sing solos. She graduated from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics and chemistry at the age of 20. She attended the Aspen Music Festival and School and then attended Juilliard School of Music in New York, where she studied with mezzo-soprano Jennie Tourel and participated in master classes led by soprano Maria Callas. She graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in music.

==Musical career==
In 1974, Hendricks made her professional operatic debut in Europe at the Glyndebourne Festival and in America at the San Francisco Opera. During her career, she has appeared at major opera houses throughout the world, including the Opéra National de Paris, the Metropolitan Opera, the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and La Scala. In 1998 she sang Liù in the historical performance of &quot;Turandot&quot; at the Forbidden City in Beijing. Hendricks has performed more than twenty roles, twelve of which she has recorded.

Hendricks has appeared on film as Mimì in &quot;La bohème&quot;, and in 1995 she sang the role of Anne Truelove in the Swedish film &quot;Rucklarens väg&quot;, an adaptation of Stravinsky&#x27;s opera &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;. In 2007, she appeared in the film &quot;Disengagement&quot; by Amos Gitai and starring Juliette Binoche. She also recorded Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;, which is the main theme for the film.

Hendricks also performs jazz music and made her jazz debut at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1994. Since that time, she has performed at major jazz festivals around the world. Hendricks is also known for her love of chamber music and has organized a number of chamber music festivals.

In 2004, at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris, she created the role of Angel in the world premiere of Péter Eötvös&#x27;s opera &quot;Angels in America&quot;, after the play by Tony Kushner.

In January 2006, she left EMI, and created the new label Arte Verum for which she records exclusively.

In 2018, Hendricks sang &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; with the Choir of the French Army at the interment ceremony of Simone Veil in the Panthéon.

==Humanitarian work==

Since 2000, Hendricks has been a member of the Council of the Foundation for the Refugee Education Trust (RET). The RET is dedicated to post-primary education of refugee youth all over the world.

In 1991 and 1993 Hendricks gave two concerts in the war-torn formerly Yugoslavian cities of Dubrovnik and Sarajevo. She performed in Sarajevo with the Sarajevo Opera Chorus and jazz musician Sinan Alimanović. In 1998 she founded the Barbara Hendricks Foundation for Peace and Reconciliation, which seeks to facilitate reconciliation where conflicts have already occurred.

In 2001 she performed at the Nobel Prize ceremony in Oslo at the invitation of Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Kofi Annan. In May 2002, she performed at the East Timor Independence Day Ceremony.

<doc id="481790" wikidata="Q471395" url="?curid=481790" title="Citation (horse)">
<text>Citation (April 11, 1945 – August 8, 1970) was a champion American Thoroughbred racehorse who is the eighth winner of the American Triple Crown. He won 16 consecutive stakes races and was the first horse in history to win .

==Background==
Owned and bred by Calumet Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, Citation was a bay colt by Bull Lea from the imported mare Hydroplane (GB), who was by the leading sire Hyperion. Although Citation was bred in Kentucky, his pedigree was largely European. He also traces back through his father Bull Lea to two outstanding horses from New Zealand (Trenton and Carbine), both sired by English sire Musket, the much loved and revered superstar of the late 1800s. As a descendant of the broodmare Glasalt, Citation was related to the 2000 Guineas winner Colorado: the same branch of Thoroughbred &quot;Family&quot; 3-l later produced the Preakness Stakes winner Gate Dancer.

Citation was trained by the Hall of Fame inductee Ben Jones and his son, Hall of Famer Horace A. &quot;Jimmy&quot; Jones. The horse was originally ridden by Al Snider and later by Eddie Arcaro and Steve Brooks.

==Racing career==

===1947: two-year-old season===
Citation won his first start as a two-year-old at the Havre de Grace racetrack on April 22, 1947. The race was a -furlong sprint on a sloppy track. He won by three-quarters of a length in :54 1/5. He broke the Arlington Park track record over five furlongs in his third start. For the year, he raced nine times, winning eight starts and earning $155,680. His only loss came at the heels of his stablemate, Bewitch, in the Washington Park Futurity, which the filly won in stakes-record time for six furlongs. Citation racked up victories in the Elementary Stakes, Futurity Trial, Futurity Stakes, and Pimlico Futurity. He was named champion two-year-old.

===1948: three-year-old season===
Citation started the 1948 racing season with two victories over older horse Armed, who had been named Thoroughbred racing&#x27;s 1947 Horse of the Year, in an allowance race and the Seminole Handicap. It is rare for a three-year-old to defeat older horses so early in the year, let alone a top handicap star such as Armed.

After Citation won the Everglades Stakes and the Flamingo Stakes at Hialeah Park, Snider drowned while fishing off the Florida Keys. Calumet Farm hired Arcaro, one of Snider&#x27;s friends. In Arcaro&#x27;s first start on Citation, they lost to Saggy in the Chesapeake Trial Stakes. This was the last race that Citation lost for almost two years.

Citation reversed the loss to Saggy in the Chesapeake Stakes at Havre de Grace Racetrack, which he won over Bovard by 4 lengths, with Saggy well back. Citation followed with his final Kentucky Derby prep, a win in the Derby Trial Stakes.

In the Kentucky Derby, ridden by Arcaro, Citation won by 3 lengths over his stablemate, eventual 1949 Horse of the Year Coaltown, and Arcaro gave the widow of former jockey Al Snider a share of his Derby purse money. Citation was then sent to Baltimore where he won the Preakness Stakes by 5 lengths. There was a 4-week gap between the Preakness and Belmont and Citation&#x27;s trainer thought he should run in a race during that time as a &quot;warm-up&quot; for Cy&#x27;s Belmont. It was decided Cy would run in the Jersey Stakes which he won by an easy 11 lengths. Now he was ready to go to Belmont Park in New York. On June 12, 1948, Citation became the eighth Triple Crown winner by capturing the Belmont Stakes, winning it by 8 lengths and tying the stakes record of 2:28 set by the sixth Triple Crown winner, Count Fleet.

Citation then won the Stars and Stripes Handicap, equaling Armed&#x27;s track record. He next won the American Derby and the Sysonby Mile. After that came the Jockey Club Gold Cup at , which he won by seven lengths over 1947 Preakness winner Phalanx. He then won the Empire City Gold Cup.

In Citation&#x27;s next start, he deterred potential challengers and won the Pimlico Special in a rare walkover. Citation then traveled to California, where he finished the year with two wins, including in the Tanforan Handicap at Tanforan Racetrack.

By the end of his three-year-old season, Citation had a record of 20 starts, 19 wins and $709,470, for a new single season record. His total career record now stood at 27 victories and two seconds in 29 starts and earnings of $865,150. He had also amassed a 15-race winning streak. For his performances, Citation was named Horse of the Year, gaining 161 of a possible 163 votes in the poll conducted by &quot;Turf and Sport Digest&quot; magazine. Toward the end of his three-year-old season, he developed an osselet.

===1950–1951: later career===
The osselet injury kept Citation from racing in 1949, but he came back to race in 1950, winning his 16th race in a row at Santa Anita Park (a streak that stood alone among major North American stakes horses until Cigar equaled the feat in 1994–96; Zenyatta and Peppers Pride both later broke the mark by winning their 19th race in a row, Peppers Pride in 2008 and Zenyatta in 2010; Rapid Redux then surpassed their records in 2012 with 22 straight wins, although not against major stakes competition). His owner, Calumet Farm, had brought Citation back from his injury in 1950 with the intention of making him the first horse to earn $1 million, but he came against the English import Noor, who defeated Citation four times (Citation carrying more weight in the first three encounters), in the Santa Anita Handicap at 1 miles, the San Juan Capistrano Handicap at 1 miles in world record time, the Forty Niners Handicap at 1 miles in track record time, and the Golden Gate Handicap. 

In the latter event, Noor conceded weight to Citation and set a world record of 1:58 which stood as an American record on a dirt track until Spectacular Bid broke it 30 years later. Citation&#x27;s times in these races would have also been records; he did not become a millionaire at age five solely because Noor ran faster than any horse in history up to that point. Citation himself set a world record in winning the Golden Gate Mile Handicap in 1:33 in a race that Noor sat out.

Citation was brought back by his owners one more time at age six in 1951 in an attempt to become the first racehorse to win a record one million dollars. After two third-place finishes, Citation finished out of the money for the first time in the Hollywood Premiere Handicap. After another loss in the Argonaut Handicap, he returned to form with victories in the Century Handicap, American Handicap, and Hollywood Gold Cup, winning over his stablemate, the mare Bewitch. The Gold Cup victory put him over $1 million in career earnings, and he was then retired to stud.

==Stud record==
Citation retired after the Hollywood Gold Cup. As a sire at Calumet Farm, he produced a number of noteworthy offspring including the Hall of Fame filly Silver Spoon, Get Around (won $164,868), Guadalcanal (won $243,337) and 1956 Preakness Stakes winner Fabius.

While at stud at Calumet Farm, he was said to be afraid of owner Lucille P. Markey&#x27;s Yorkshire Terrier Timmy Tammy. The dog reportedly nipped at him on several occasions.

He died on August 8, 1970, at the age of 25 and was buried in the horse cemetery at Calumet Farm.

==Honors==
In 1959, Citation was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

In the Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the Top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, Citation was ranked #3.

Around the time of Citation&#x27;s death, Jim Taylor, a marketing executive at Cessna Aircraft Company, convinced chairman Dwane Wallace to use Citation&#x27;s name for the new business jet Cessna was designing. Cessna has continued to use the Citation name and trademark horseshoe logo for an entire series of jet aircraft that comprise the Cessna Citation family.

A famous statue of Citation can be found at Hialeah Park. This statue is shown in Godfather II as Michael Corleone travels to Miami to visit Hyman Roth.

In 2020, as part of a fundraiser for emergency relief efforts due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a &quot;virtual Kentucky Derby&quot; was held wherein the field included all 13 Triple Crown winners. Citation finished second (placed) to Secretariat.

<text>Arthur Lee Porter Jr. (August 3, 1961 – November 23, 1996) was an American jazz saxophonist. He was the son of jazz musician Art Porter Sr. and the namesake of &quot;The Art Porter Bill&quot;.

==Early life==
Art Porter Jr. was born in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1961. Porter joined his father&#x27;s band (The Art Porter Trio) as a drummer at the age of 9 and played with them into his teen years. Porter was then drawn to the saxophone, after noticing its melodic abilities, and began to play it during shows with his father&#x27;s group. Porter is a 1979 graduate of Parkview Arts and Science Magnet High School in Little Rock, where he played in the marching and jazz bands. When Porter turned 16, he began to be barred from clubs because he was under 21. It was during this time that he was arrested and charged with working under-age in a nightclub serving alcoholic beverages. Then Arkansas Attorney General, and future President of the United States Bill Clinton, who was also a saxophonist, intervened to get the charges dropped and pushed for the law to be changed to allow under-age musicians to appear in adult facilities as long as their legal guardians accompanied them. This law became known as &quot;The Art Porter Bill&quot;.

===College===
Porter attended Berklee College of Music and Northeastern Illinois University where he studied music, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Arts in the latter. He later attended Roosevelt University, where he would earn his master&#x27;s degree. Porter studied piano under Ellis Marsalis, a former saxophonist himself.

==Career==
In the mid-1980s, Porter moved to Chicago, Illinois, and studied tenor saxophone with Von Freeman and performed with Pharoah Sanders and Jack McDuff. During the 1990s, he developed an interest in R&amp;B and hip hop and merged elements of these into his performances. Soon after this, Porter signed with Verve Forecast Records and PolyGram and produced several albums, beginning in the summer of 1992 with &quot;Pocket City&quot;, followed by &quot;Straight to the Point&quot;, &quot;Undercover&quot;, and finally &quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot;. Porter and his father performed for President Clinton during his 1993 inauguration, playing Amazing Grace at a prayer breakfast.

==Death==
In 1996, Porter traveled to Thailand to appear at the Thailand International Jazz Festival. After the festival on November 23, he went boating on the Kratha Taek reservoir in Sai Yok. The boat Porter was traveling on started to sink, and Porter, along with several others, drowned. Porter was survived by his wife and two elementary-aged sons. In 1998, the album &quot;For Art&#x27;s Sake&quot; was posthumously released in his honor. It is a compilation album composed of songs from Porter&#x27;s previous albums, as well as two previously unreleased songs. It also features one song by Jeff Lorber dedicated to Porter.

==Awards and honors==
Porter was inducted into the Arkansas Jazz Hall of Fame and the Arkansas Entertainers Hall of Fame. He received the Arkansas Jazz Hall of Fame Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998.

<text>Stephen Owen Stephens (April 22, 1930 – January 29, 2021) was a broadcasting pioneer in Arkansas, who originally became well known as the host of &quot;Steve&#x27;s Show&quot;, a hugely popular television program in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He remained a communication specialist well into the 21st century.

==Early years==
Born in 1930, to Allie and Owen Stephens in Newport, Arkansas, Stephens later attended Castle Heights Military Academy, and graduated from Newport High School. Following graduation, he attended the University of Arkansas until the Korean War erupted in 1950, when in his quest for adventure, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. Attaining the rank of sergeant, he received three battle stars in Korea. After the Korean armistice was signed in 1953, he was honorably discharged and returned to Newport.

==Career==
While in the Marines, he was occasionally asked if he had ever been a broadcaster, as he seemed to have a natural &quot;radio voice.&quot; After returning to Newport, he began as a part-time announcer at radio station KNBY, and soon became known as the &quot;Voice of the White River Valley.&quot;

His entry into radio coincided with the beginnings of rock and roll, and he soon became a popular proponent of this new type of music. His style began to capture the attention of Little Rock television station KTHV, the Arkansas affiliate of the CBS television network, who offered him an entry position as a station announcer.

Shortly after joining the station, he began hosting a television dance party in March 1957, which became an instant success. As bus loads of teenagers began arriving from all over the state, the show was expanded to six days a week.

Stephens helped launch the careers of Johnny Cash, Conway Twitty, Charlie Rich, Brenda Lee, Sonny Burgess, Fabian Forte and many others who appeared on &quot;Steve&#x27;s Show&quot; during its 8-year run. As a result of his continuing popularity during that time, he was awarded a recording contract, recording &quot;Pizza Pete,&quot; &quot;Honey Bee,&quot; &quot;How It Used To Be,&quot; and &quot;Weird Session&quot;, and was voted &quot;Arkansas Top Television Personality.&quot;

From 1957 until 1965, he served as senior weatherman for KTHV television at both 6:00 pm and 10:00 pm, and was also the first to use radar in his weathercast. He new broke ground in another way when he became one of the first TV weathermen in the nation to use radar to detect Santa Claus flying into the state.

Stephens went on to produce other TV programs for KTHV, including &quot;Eye on Arkansas&quot;, which showcased such celebrities as Liberace, then-actor Ronald Reagan, Roy Rogers, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., the casts of the popular TV programs &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; and &quot;Bonanza&quot;, and many other notables.

==Retirement from television==
In 1965, Stephens left television after being invited by U.S. Senator John Little McClellan to join him on his staff in Washington, D.C. as a special assistant in charge of media relations. In 1968, he returned to Arkansas to form his own advertising, public relations, and travel agency.

In 1986, he was approached by financier Jackson T. Stephens, chairman of the investment banking firm of Stephens Inc., to join him as his assistant and director of corporate communications. He remained with Stephens Inc. until his retirement in 1998. Following retirement, he continued to be active as a &quot;voice talent&quot; for numerous local and national radio and television commercials, as well as documentaries. In 2005, he created and began narrating a radio program for public radio station KUAR/AETN, &quot;Biography Arkansas&quot;.

==Recognition==
Stephens also served as a National Trustee for the March of Dimes Foundation for over a decade, and was named an Honorary Life Trustee of the organization in 1998. During that time, he was awarded the &quot;Jonas Salk Lifetime Achievement&quot; award by the Salk Institute for his fund raising efforts on behalf of the March of Dimes.

In recognition of his pioneering achievements in broadcasting, he was inducted into the Arkansas Entertainers Hall of Fame, and later his name was added to the Arkansas Walk of Fame in Hot Springs. On April 22, 2010 (the anniversary of his birthday), he was recognized by the Eighth General Assembly of the Arkansas House of Representatives with a Lifetime Achievement Citation, &quot;for maintaining a high degree of professionalism and integrity during his 50 years in the business and broadcasting community of Arkansas.&quot; In 2011, he was inducted into his hometown (Newport, Arkansas) High School Hall of Fame.

In 2018, Stephens was honored by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences MidAmerica Chapter with a Lifetime Achievement Award honoring individuals who have represented the very best of television, while making a significant contribution to broadcasting.

<text>Gao Zhan (Chinese: 高瞻) is a researcher who worked at the American University in Washington, DC. In 2001, the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China detained her for 166 days on the grounds that she was spying for Taiwan. At that time, she was widely regarded as a political dissident.

Upon her release through medical parole, she was scheduled to become a naturalized citizen of the United States, but the ceremony was quickly cancelled. The reason for this became apparent in late 2003, when Gao was convicted on charges of violating export regulations in selling microprocessors to the Chinese government. It was revealed that Gao had been under investigation since 2000, before she was detained in China.

After her conviction for export of controlled technology, Gao faced the possibility of deportation
following her jail sentence. Upon release from prison, her deportation was effectively cancelled.
