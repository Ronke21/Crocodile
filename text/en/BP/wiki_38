<text>Sophie Michelle Ellis-Bextor (born 10 April 1979) is an English singer and songwriter. She first came to prominence in the late 1990s as the lead vocalist of the indie rock band Theaudience. After the group disbanded, Ellis-Bextor went solo and achieved success beginning in the early 2000s. Her music is mainstream pop and dance with influences of disco, nu-disco, and 1980s electronic music.

In 2000, Ellis-Bextor collaborated with Italian DJ Spiller on &quot;Groovejet (If This Ain&#x27;t Love)&quot;, which reached number one in the United Kingdom and in 2015 became the UK&#x27;s biggest-selling vinyl single of the millennium so far. Her debut solo studio album, &quot;Read My Lips&quot;, was released in 2001 and peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart. It was certified double platinum by the BPI, and sold 1.5 million copies worldwide. Three of its four singles—the Cher cover &quot;Take Me Home&quot;, &quot;Murder on the Dancefloor&quot;, and double A-side &quot;Get Over You&quot; / &quot;Move This Mountain&quot;—reached top three in the UK. Its follow-up &quot;Shoot from the Hip&quot; (2003) reached number 19 in the UK and spawned two top ten singles, &quot;Mixed Up World&quot; and &quot;I Won&#x27;t Change You&quot;.

Ellis-Bextor&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Trip the Light Fantastic&quot; (2007), peaked at number seven in the UK and its lead single &quot;Catch You&quot; reached the top ten. Her fourth studio album, &quot;Make a Scene&quot; (2011), and its third single &quot;Bittersweet&quot; achieved top 40 positions in the UK. Her fifth studio album, &quot;Wanderlust&quot; (2014), peaked at number four. In 2016, she released a Latin-inspired sixth studio album, &quot;Familia&quot;, to critical acclaim.

==Early life==

Sophie Michelle Ellis-Bextor was born on 10 April 1979 in Hounslow, London to Janet Ellis, who was a presenter on BBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s television programmes &quot;Blue Peter&quot; and &quot;Jigsaw&quot;, and Robin Bextor, a film producer and director. They separated when she was four. As a child, Ellis-Bextor occasionally appeared on &quot;Blue Peter&quot; alongside her mother, who co-presented the programme.

She attended St Stephen&#x27;s School, Twickenham and later the independent Godolphin and Latymer School in Hammersmith. Among her earliest public performances were some with the W11 Opera children&#x27;s opera beginning at age 13, and she is now a patron of the organisation.

Ellis-Bextor has said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t see myself as a good-looking girl and that was good, because I didn&#x27;t rely on it.(...) I&#x27;ve now found lots of like-minded weirdos, so it&#x27;s OK.&quot;

==Career==
===1996–1999: Theaudience===

Ellis-Bextor began her professional musical career in 1996 while singing lead vocals in indie band Theaudience. The band released four singles, including the UK Top 40 hits &quot;I Know Enough (I Don&#x27;t Get Enough)&quot; and &quot;A Pessimist Is Never Disappointed&quot;, and one self-titled album (&quot;theaudience&quot; (1998)). Videos for the band&#x27;s singles were directed by her father, Robin Bextor. While in Theaudience, readers of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; voted Ellis-Bextor number five in a poll of &#x27;most sexy people in rock&#x27;.

The band split in 1999 after demos for a planned second album were rejected by their label Mercury Records, who then dropped the band. Ellis-Bextor recorded a duet with Manic Street Preachers — &quot;Black Holes for the Young&quot; — as a B-side for their 1998 single &quot;The Everlasting&quot;, and in 1999, made an appearance on the Departure Lounge album &quot;Out of Here&quot;.

===2000–2006: &quot;Read My Lips&quot; and &quot;Shoot from the Hip&quot; ===
After Theaudience split, Ellis-Bextor collaborated with Italian DJ Spiller, in 2000, adding vocals to his track &quot;Groovejet (If This Ain&#x27;t Love)&quot;. It entered the UK charts at number one, just beating former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham on her first solo track. &quot;Groovejet&quot; won several awards: No. 1, Pop Top 20; No. 1, ILR; No. 1, Radio 1; No. 8, top dance track of 2000 and single of the year in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. In the &quot;Metro&quot; newspaper, it received ninth place in the contest for the Greatest No. 1 of all time. In 2000, it was a finalist in &quot;The Record of the Year&quot;. In that same year, it won the awards for Best Single and Best Ibiza Tune at the Ericsson Muzik Awards.

In 2001, Ellis-Bextor released her début album, &quot;Read My Lips&quot;. It reached number two on the UK charts and spawned four top-twenty hit singles. Her rework of Cher&#x27;s &quot;Take Me Home&quot; reached number two, as did &quot;Murder on the Dancefloor&quot;, which became Ellis-Bextor&#x27;s biggest single and was on charts for twenty-three weeks. &quot;Murder on the Dancefloor&quot; became Europe&#x27;s most played song of 2002. In 2002, &quot;Read My Lips&quot; was re-released with two new songs (and a live version of &quot;Groovejet&quot;) and Ellis-Bextor won the Recording Artist Award at that year&#x27;s Showbusiness Awards. Her third single, &quot;Get Over You / Move This Mountain&quot;, was released in June 2002 and reached number three. The fourth single, &quot;Music Gets the Best of Me&quot;, rose to number fourteen in December. At the beginning of 2002, Ellis-Bextor was nominated for the &quot;British Female Solo Artist&quot; BRIT Award, going on to be nominated for a further two consecutive years.

Her second album, &quot;Shoot from the Hip&quot;, was released in October 2003 and yielded two further top-ten singles, &quot;Mixed Up World&quot; and &quot;I Won&#x27;t Change You&quot;. The album reached number 19 on the UK charts and was certified silver by the BPI for shipments of 60,000. Ellis-Bextor described the album as &quot;more emotionally direct&quot; and &quot;a little more left-of-centre at times&quot; than &quot;Read My Lips&quot;—&quot;It has more of a live feel [...] It&#x27;s still a pop album—with elements of disco, indie and rock.&quot; She opted to step back from promotion of the album after becoming pregnant.

In 2005, Ellis-Bextor was featured on the Busface single &quot;Circles (Just My Good Time)&quot; under the alias Mademoiselle E.B.

===2007–2011: &quot;Trip the Light Fantastic&quot; and &quot;Make a Scene&quot; ===
&quot;Trip the Light Fantastic&quot;, Ellis-Bextor&#x27;s third album, was released in May 2007 and reached number seven in the UK. The album produced three singles: &quot;Catch You&quot; (number 8 in the UK), &quot;Me and My Imagination&quot; (number 23), and &quot;Today the Sun&#x27;s on Us&quot; (number 64). The song &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; was announced as a single but later retracted.

Ellis-Bextor supported George Michael on his UK tour leg in June 2007. Her own UK tour, the Trip the Light Fantastic Tour, was due to start in August 2007, but it was postponed after Ellis-Bextor was invited to be the &quot;special guest&quot; on Take That&#x27;s Beautiful World Tour, which commenced in October 2007. She stated that her tour would be rescheduled for March 2008, with all tickets purchased being valid for the rescheduled concerts. The tour was never rescheduled and Ellis-Bextor has refused to discuss the issue in interviews. In October 2008, she sang at the Keep the Promise Rally in Trafalgar Square to end Child Poverty.

In June 2009, Ellis-Bextor was featured on the Freemasons single &quot;Heartbreak (Make Me a Dancer)&quot;, which reached number 13 in the UK. In July, she performed alongside girl groups the Saturdays and Girls Can&#x27;t Catch at the iTunes Festival, held at the Roundhouse in London. A recording of her performance was released, &quot;Sophie Ellis-Bextor: iTunes Live in London&quot;, which was the singer&#x27;s first extended play. &quot;Bittersweet&quot; (co-written by Freemasons and Hannah Robinson), the first single from Ellis-Bextor&#x27;s fourth album, was released in May 2010 and reached 25 on the UK Singles Chart. Ellis-Bextor&#x27;s collaboration with DJ Armin van Buuren, &quot;Not Giving Up on Love&quot;, was released as a single in August 2010 in Europe. Also in 2010, she was featured on the Junior Caldera single &quot;Can&#x27;t Fight This Feeling&quot;.

The singer&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Make a Scene&quot;, was released in June 2011 following a year-long delay during which she left her label Universal Music Group to establish her own label, EBGBs. She said that her decision to leave Universal was spurred on by the departure of the head of Fascination Records, the sub-label to which she was signed following the release of &quot;Bittersweet&quot;. She described &quot;Make a Scene&quot; as &quot;very much [a dance album]—more so than any of my other albums.&quot; She said she was planning an &quot;album that&#x27;s really different [...] but I think this album [&quot;Make a Scene&quot;] is a good way to bow out of the dance sound for now. I think it&#x27;s finishing on a high.&quot; She supported Pet Shop Boys on the UK leg of their Pandemonium Tour in July 2010. She worked with Calvin Harris, Richard X, Dimitri Tikovoi, Hannah Robinson, Metronomy, and Liam Howe from the Sneaker Pimps. &quot;Off &amp; On&quot; preceded the release of the album in continental Europe and Russia, where the album was released by Universal Music Russia. The single &quot;Starlight&quot; was released in the UK ahead of the album in May 2011.

Ellis-Bextor supported synth-pop band Erasure on their Total Pop! Forest tour of woodland locations in the UK in June 2011. She resumed touring internationally in 2011, playing venues such as Jakarta&#x27;s SoulNation festival, as well as returning to Australia by performing in Sydney and Melbourne. She collaborated with French DJ Bob Sinclar on a track titled &quot;F__ with You&quot; (released in November 2011); it was included on his album &quot;Disco Crash&quot; and was a huge club hit in Continental Europe. Ellis-Bextor&#x27;s collaboration with French DJ Mathieu Bouthier, &quot;Beautiful&quot;, was released in July 2012 in France.

===2012–2014: &quot;Wanderlust&quot; and collaborations===

In May 2011, she revealed that she had begun work on her fifth album. Beginning in 2012, Ellis-Bextor worked with British singer and producer Ed Harcourt on a &quot;more concept driven record&quot;, and possibly having as few as eight tracks. Her performance at a London charity gala in November 2012 including a new song, &quot;Young Blood&quot;; a demo of the song was released in March 2013 as a complimentary digital download from her website, as a thank you gift to her fans. Also in 2013, she performed outdoors at Old Republic Square in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Ellis-Bextor confirmed completion of the album in May and revealed its title, &quot;Wanderlust&quot;, and cover art in October.

&quot;Young Blood&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;Wanderlust&quot; in November 2013, peaking at number three on the UK Indie Chart and at number 34 on the UK Singles Chart. The album was released in January 2014 and peaked at number four on the UK Albums Chart and at number one on the UK Independent Albums Chart. &quot;Wanderlust&quot; also debuted inside the Scottish Top 10 Albums Chart. Ellis-Bextor performed a headline sold-out show to support &quot;Wanderlust&quot;″s release in January 2014 at Bush Hall, London, and also performed at Union Chapel, London in April. Ellis-Bextor then announced a 10-date UK tour, which finished in Glasgow in April 2014.

Ellis-Bextor collaborated with Guéna LG and Amir Afargan on the track &quot;Back 2 Paradise&quot;, which was released in June 2014. The single was the number-one &quot;breakout&quot; in October 2014 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance/Club Chart, later reaching number 25 on the Dance/Club Chart. Ellis-Bextor then featured on the song &quot;Only Child&quot;, produced by electronic music project DedRekoning, which was released in September 2014. The track was remixed by Paul Oakenfold, Roddy Reynaert and Pearson and Hirst.

===2015–2019: &quot;Familia&quot; and &quot;The Song Diaries&quot;===

In January 2015, Ellis-Bextor said that she had begun working on her sixth studio album, once again with Ed Harcourt. In January 2016, Ellis-Bextor posted an image on Instagram captioned &quot;Last song written. Next stop – rehearsals! &quot;#album6 #whatthehellshouldicallit&quot;.&quot; She also posted a YouTube video of the making of the album.
According to Ellis-Bextor, the album, titled &quot;Familia&quot;, was inspired by a recent visit to North America, particularly Mexico. &quot;Familia&quot; is the Spanish word for &quot;family&quot; (a tattoo Ellis-Bextor wears in her arm since her first child&#x27;s birth) and Ellis-Bextor described the album&#x27;s sound as closer to that of her earlier albums. She explained that she &quot;wanted something with a Spanish or Italian feel&quot; and that it continued some stories from &quot;Wanderlust&quot;. &quot;Familia&quot; was released in September 2016 and reached number 12 on the UK Albums Chart. It spawned four singles, but none of them made it into any major chart. After taking time off for the birth of her child in late 2015, she resumed touring in 2017, mostly at small venues in the UK.

In November 2017, she announced via Facebook a selection of her greatest hits reworked with an orchestra. In February 2018, she announced the album&#x27;s title, &quot;The Song Diaries&quot;, and pointed out that it would consist of re-recorded tracks spanning her career from theaudience to &quot;Familia&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Wild Forever&quot;, plus a new track. The album&#x27;s artwork was drawn by David Downtown. &quot;The Song Diaries&quot; first single &quot;Love Is You&quot;, a disco track originally performed by Carol Williams, which is sampled on her early hit &quot;Groovejet&quot;, was released in August 2018. &quot;The Song Diaries&quot; was released in March 2019 and peaked at number 14 in the UK.

===2020–2023: &quot;Songs from the Kitchen Disco&quot;===
In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in the UK, Ellis-Bextor performed live weekly &quot;Kitchen Disco&quot; concerts featuring herself and her family, streamed live from their kitchen on Instagram. Beginning 24 June 2020, Ellis-Bextor started a weekly podcast titled &quot;Spinning Plates with Sophie Ellis-Bextor&quot; on which she interviews working mothers. Guests have included Fearne Cotton, Caitlin Moran, Myleene Klass, Róisin Murphy, and her own mother Janet Ellis.

On 16 July 2020, Ellis-Bextor announced the greatest hits album &quot;Songs from the Kitchen Disco&quot;. The album was preceded by the release of a single, &quot;Crying at the Discoteque&quot;, a cover version of the Alcazar song, which she had performed during her lockdown concerts in September 2020. She performed the single on &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; on New Year&#x27;s Eve. In March 2022, she embarked on her &quot;Songs from the Kitchen Disco&quot; tour of the U.K. In July 2022, the singer revealed a new single, &quot;Hypnotized&quot;, a collaboration with electronic artist Wuh Oh. 

A live album was released in November 2022 entitled &quot;Kitchen Disco – Live at the London Palladium&quot;.

===2023–present: &quot;Hana&quot;, resurgence, and eighth album===
In January 2023, Ellis-Bextor collaborated with Japanese/Australian duo Rhyme So on a cover of the Malcolm McLaren track &quot;Deep in Vogue&quot;. On 8 February 2023, Ellis-Bextor revealed a new track, &quot;Breaking the Circle&quot;, the lead single from her seventh studio album, &quot;Hana&quot;, which was released on 2 June 2023. The title of the album was taken from the Japanese word for &quot;blossom&quot; or &quot;flower&quot;. Ellis-Bextor said the album was inspired by a trip to Japan, taken before the COVID-19 pandemic began. Ellis-Bextor said of the album: &quot;Because I hadn&#x27;t been before, I had lots of ideas about what [Japan] might be like. The [album&#x27;s] soundscape is like someone&#x27;s idea of what a place might be like before they get there. That trip also became significant in a wider sense because it was the last bit of travel I did before everything shut down.&quot; &quot;Hana&quot; marks the third collaboration with producer/musician Ed Harcourt. Ellis-Bextor said &quot;There are themes of optimism, new starts, adventures and reflections...This is our third record together after Wanderlust and Familia. The first songs written were really inspired by the upcoming trip to Japan. In the end, the album ended up being inspired by that trip and so much more.&quot;

In June 2023, Ellis-Bextor appeared on &quot;Grilled!&quot;, a podcast by the Staff Canteen, where she was interviewed by Aaron Middleton and the Staff Canteen&#x27;s Cara Houchen. During the podcast, Ellis-Bextor discussed her book, her favourite London restaurants, and the similarities between music and food. In July 2023, it was announced that Ellis-Bextor will collaborate with film composer David Arnold and lyricist Don Black for the track to Channel 4 and Universal Pictures film, &quot;Mog&#x27;s Christmas&quot;, based upon the children&#x27;s book series by Judith Kerr. The track, titled &quot;As Long As I Belong&quot;, is about &quot;the importance of belonging&quot;. Ellis-Bextor also collaborated with Robbie Williams and his electronic music project &#x27;Lufthaus&#x27; on the track &quot;Immortal&quot;, which is taken off of the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;&quot;Visions, Volume 1&quot;.&quot; The album was released on 6 October 2023.

Ellis-Bextor&#x27;s &quot;Murder on the Dancefloor&quot; was featured in the last scene of the 2023 film &quot;Saltburn&quot;. As a result, the song re-entered the UK singles chart, peaking at number two and garnered its most-ever global streams on Spotify, receiving more than 1.4 million streams on New Year&#x27;s Eve. It also gave Ellis-Bextor her first ever US singles chart entry, reaching #51. As well as this, 2024 became Ellis-Bextor&#x27;s most successful year in terms of performances, playing more shows than she had ever before – a total of 110 in the calendar year.

On 1 February 2024, it was revealed that Ellis-Bextor will be performing at &quot;Valley Fest 2024&quot; in Chew Magna in August 2024. The same month, Ellis-Bextor announced her first-ever North American headlining tour, scheduled for May and June 2024. The initial seven-date tour included stops in San Francisco, San Diego, Washington D.C., Boston, Philadelphia, New York City, and Toronto. In June 2024, she announced a second North American tour leg for September given the first leg&#x27;s success, adding shows in Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver.

Following the resurgence of &quot;Murder on the Dancefloor&quot;, Ellis-Bextor reportedly signed with Universal Music Group and began working on her eighth studio album. Her first major-label single in 14 years, &quot;Freedom of the Night&quot;, was released under Decca Records on October 18, 2024. On 25 October 2024, it was announced that Ellis-Bextor&#x27;s forthcoming eighth studio album, &quot;The Invisible Line&quot;, would be released in the summer of 2025.

Fourteen months later, in 2005, the couple married. They have five children, all sons.

<text>Lauren Michelle Hill (born June 27, 1979) is an American model and actress. She first appeared on the cover of &quot;Playboy&quot; on the October (Girls of Conference USA) 2000 issue. She was chosen as &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate of the Month in February 2001 and won the &quot;Playboy&quot; playmates edition of the game show &quot;Fear Factor&quot;. Hill then returned for &quot;Fear Factor&quot;″s Tournament of Champions for season 2, but was eliminated in the second round. She was a cheerleader at the University of South Carolina while studying journalism. While modeling and acting, she is known as Lauren James. She was first spotted by a Playboy scout at a swimsuit competition in St. Croix.

She appeared in the 2005 &quot;Playmates at Play at the Playboy Mansion&quot; swimsuit calendar as calendar girl of February. The calendar was the inaugural &quot;Playmates at Play&quot; calendar and it was shot on the grounds of Playboy Mansion in 2004. It was &quot;Playboy&quot;&#x27;s first attempt at creating a non-nude swimsuit calendar featuring Playmates similar in style with those from &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot;.

She has also been a GUESS model as well as appearing in &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine and its 2006 wall calendar. She has appeared in several music videos, including videos for Bryan Adams, Weezer, Justin Timberlake, and Marc Anthony. Prior to her modeling career, she had been a child actress, having appeared in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Heavyweights&quot; as an attractive girl who captivates the other boys at a dance, which was mentioned during her Playmate debut.

Hill appeared as herself in the 2008 film &quot;The House Bunny&quot;.

==Personal life==
She is married to actor Sean Patrick Flanery and they have two sons together.

<doc id="473763" wikidata="Q3482590" url="?curid=473763" title="Neutering">
<text>Neutering, from the Latin (&#x27;of neither sex&#x27;), is the removal of a non-human animal&#x27;s reproductive organ, either all of it or a considerably large part. The male-specific term is castration, while spaying is usually reserved for female animals. Colloquially, both terms are often referred to as fixing. In male horses, castrating is referred to as &quot;gelding&quot;. An animal that has not been neutered is sometimes referred to as entire or intact. Often the term &quot;neuter[ing]&quot; is used to specifically mean castration, e.g. in phrases like &quot;spay and neuter&quot;.

Neutering is the most common method for animal sterilization. Humane societies, animal shelters, and rescue groups urge pet owners to have their pets neutered to prevent the births of unwanted litters, which contribute to the overpopulation of unwanted animals in the rescue system. Many countries require that all adopted cats and dogs be sterilized before going to their new homes.

==Methods of sterilization==

===Females (spaying)===

Spaying is the surgical removal of the ovaries and sometimes uterus in female animals. It is commonly performed as a method of birth control and behavior modification.

In non-human animals, the technical term is an ovo-hysterectomy or ovariohysterectomy; while in humans, this is called a hystero-oophorectomy. One form of spaying is to remove only the ovaries (oophorectomy or ovariectomy), which is mainly done in cats and young dogs as well as in laparoscopic procedures. Another, less commonly performed method is an &quot;ovary-sparing spay&quot; in which the uterus is removed but one (or both) ovaries are left. A complete ovariohysterectomy may involve removal of the ovaries, uterus, oviducts, and uterine horns.
The surgery can be performed using a traditional open approach or by laparoscopic &quot;keyhole&quot; surgery. Open surgery is more widely available, as laparoscopic surgical equipment costs are expensive. Traditional open surgery is usually performed through a ventral midline incision below the umbilicus. The incision size varies depending upon the surgeon and the size of the animal. The uterine horns are identified and the ovaries are found by following the horns to their ends.

There is a ligament that attaches the ovaries to the body wall, which may need to be broken down so the ovaries can be identified. The ovarian arteries are then ligated with resorbable suture material and then the arteries transected. The uterine body (which is very short in litter-bearing species) and related arteries are also tied off just in front of the cervix (leaving the cervix as a natural barrier). The entire uterus and ovaries are then removed. The abdomen is checked for bleeding and then closed with a three-layer closure. The linea alba and then the subcutaneous layer are closed with resorbable suture material. The skin is then stapled, sutured, or glued closed. For suturing the feline linea alba, the most appropriate suture bite and stitch interval size was suggested to be 5 mm.

Laparoscopic surgery is performed using a camera and instruments placed through small incisions (ports) in the body wall. The patient is under anaesthesia and lying on the back. The incisions are between and the number varies according to the equipment and technique used. The surgeon watches on a screen during the operation. The first port is made just behind the umbilicus and the camera is inserted. The abdomen is inflated with carbon dioxide gas to create a space in which to operate. A second port is introduced a few centimeters in front of the navel and a long grasping instrument called a Babcock forceps is inserted. The surgeon finds the ovary with the instrument and uses it to suspend the ovary from a needle placed through the abdominal wall. This lifts the ovary and uterus safely away from other organs. The surgeon then removes the grasping instrument and replaces it with an instrument that cauterizes and cuts tissue. This instrument uses electricity to heat the blood vessels to seal them and to cut them. No sutures are placed inside. The ovary is separated from the uterus and round ligament. The cautery instrument is removed and replaced by the grasping instrument, which is used to pull the ovary out through the small abdominal incision (port). This is repeated on the other side and the small holes are closed with a few sutures. Another method uses ligatures and even the uterus is removed. In female dogs only removing the ovaries and not the uterus is not state of the art because this way the risk of pyometra persists.

The benefits of laparoscopic surgery are less pain, faster recovery, and smaller wounds to heal. A study has shown that patients are 70% more active in the first three days post-surgery compared to open surgery. The reason open surgery is more painful is that larger incisions are required, and the ovary needs to be pulled out of the body, which stretches and tears tissue in the abdomen (it is not uncommon for patients to react under anaesthesia by breathing faster at this point).

Removing the ovaries in female dogs removes the production of progesterone, which is a natural calming hormone and a serotonin uplifter. Spaying may therefore escalate any observable aggressive behaviour, either to humans or other dogs.

The risk of infections, bleeding, ruptures, inflammation and reactions to the drugs given to the animal as part of the procedure are all possibilities that should be considered.

===Males (castration)===

In male animals, castration involves the removal of the testes (testicles), and is commonly practiced on both household pets (for birth control and behaviour modification) and on livestock (for birth control, as well as to improve commercial value). Often the term &quot;neuter[ing]&quot; is used to specifically mean castration, e.g. in phrases like &quot;spay and neuter&quot;.
===Sterilization alternatives===

====Hormone-Sparing Surgery====
Vasectomy: In a more delicate procedure than castration, the vasa deferentia – ducts that run from the testes to the penis – are cut then tied or sealed, to prevent sperm from entering into the urethra. Failure rates are insignificantly small. Breeders routinely have this procedure carried out on male ferrets and sheep to manipulate the estrus cycles of in-contact females. It is uncommon in other animal species. Because a vasectomy is usually a more expensive procedure, among pet-keepers it is more often performed on show animals, to cosmetically preserve their appearance (though depending upon the fancier organization, the procedure may invalidate the animal&#x27;s candidacy for certain awards, or relegate it to a non-pedigree, generic &quot;household pet&quot; competition division, just as with full castration).

Tubal ligation: Snipping and tying of oviducts as a sterilization measure can be performed on female cats, dogs, and other species; it is essentially the female equivalent of vasectomy, but a more invasive procedure. Risk of unwanted pregnancies is insignificantly small. Only a few veterinarians perform the procedure.

Like other forms of neutering, vasectomy and tubal ligation eliminate the ability to produce offspring. They differ from neutering in that they leave the animal&#x27;s levels and patterns of sex hormone unchanged. Both sexes will retain their normal reproductive behavior, and other than birth control, none of the advantages and disadvantages listed below apply. This method is favored by some people who seek minimal infringement on the natural state of companion animals to achieve the desired reduction of unwanted births of cats and dogs.

=====Injectable=====
* Male dogs – Two intratesticular injectable formulations are known to sterilize male dogs. Zeuterin was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for permanent sterilization of male dogs ages three months and older by causing necrosis of the testicle. It is not currently available commercially. Calcium chloride dissolved in a variety of diluents have also been studied, with the majority of research and most promising results using calcium chloride dissolved in ethyl alcohol. Calcium chloride formulations can be purchased for use in animals from compounding pharmacies, but the use of calcium chloride for sterilization of males is not approved by the FDA or any other international regulatory agency.
* Male cats – Calcium chloride formulations have also been studied in male cats. 
* Male rats – Adjudin (analogue of indazole-carboxylic acid), induces reversible germ cell loss from the seminiferous epithelium by disrupting cell adhesion function between nurse cells and immature sperm cells, preventing maturation.
* Male mice – injection of a solution of the JQ1 molecule to bind to a pocket of BRDT necessary for chromatin remodeling, which gives the proteins that regulate how genes act access to the genetic material
* Male sheep and pigs – Wireless Microvalve. A proposed non-chemical, reversible sterilization method using a piezoelectric polymer that will deform when exposed to a specific electric field broadcast from an emitter. The valve will then open or close, preventing the passage of sperm, but not seminal fluid. Located in a section of the vas deferens that occurs just after the epididymis, the implantation can be carried out by use of a hypodermic needle.
* Female mammals – Vaccine of antigens (derived from purified porcine zona pellucida) encapsulated in liposomes (cholesterol and lecithin) with an adjuvant, latest US patent RE37,224 (as of 2006-06-06), CA patent 2137263 (issued 1999-06-15). Product commercially known as SpayVac, a single injection causes a treated female mammal to produce antibodies that bind to ZP3 on the surface of her ovum, blocking sperm from fertilizing it for periods from 22 months up to 7 years (depending on the animal). This will not prevent the animal from going into heat (ovulating) and other than birth control, none of the advantages or disadvantages mentioned below apply.

====Other====
* Male mice – reversible regulation of the KATNAL1 gene in the Sertoli cell microtubule dynamics of the testes.
* Female mammals – orally administered phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor ORG 9935 daily before and during ovulation, which blocks the resumption of meiosis resulting in ovulation of a non-fertilizable, immature oocyte without rupturing the follicle.
&quot;&quot; is breeders&#x27; informal term for surgical techniques by which male livestock, such as bulls, retain their full libido (and related effects like sex pheromones that would be lost through castration), but are rendered incapable of copulation. This is done to stimulate and identify estrous females without the risk of transmitting venereal diseases or causing a pregnancy by a male other than the one intended for selective breeding. Animals altered for this purpose are referred to as teasers (teaser bulls, etc.), or gomers. Several methods are used. Penile translocation surgically alters the penis to point far enough away from its normal direction that it cannot manage vaginal penetration. Penile fixation permanently attaches the penis to the abdomen so that it cannot be lowered for penetration. Penectomy is the partial or complete removal of the penis.
==Early-age neutering==
Early-age neutering, also known as pediatric spaying or prepubertal gonadectomy, is the removal of the ovaries or testes before the onset of puberty. It is used mainly in animal sheltering and rescue where puppies and kittens can be neutered before being adopted out, eliminating non-compliance with sterilization agreement, which is typically above 40%. The American Veterinary Medical Association, American Animal Hospital Association and the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association support the procedure for population control, provided that the veterinarian uses their best knowledge when making the decision about the age at neutering. A task force recommends that cats are spayed–neutered prior to 5 months of age.

While the age-unrelated risks and benefits cited above also apply to early-age neutering, various studies have indicated that the procedure is safe and not associated with increased mortality or serious health and behavioral problems when compared to conventional age neutering. Anesthesia recovery in young animals is usually more rapid and there are fewer complications. One study found that in female dogs there is an increasing risk of urinary incontinence the earlier the procedure is carried out; the study recommended that female dogs be spayed no earlier than 3 to 4 months of age. A later study comparing female dogs spayed between 4 and 6 months and after 6 months showed no increased risk.

One study showed the incidence of hip dysplasia increased to 6.7% for dogs neutered before 5.5 months compared to 4.7% for dogs neutered after 5.5 months, although the cases associated with early age neutering seems to be of a less severe form. There was no association between age of neutering and arthritis or long-bone fractures. Another study showed no correlation between age of neutering and musculoskeletal problems. A study of large breed dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture associated early-age neutering with the development of an excessive tibial plateau angle.

Of particular note are two recent studies from Lynette Hart&#x27;s lab at UC Davis. The first study from 2013, published in a well-known interdisciplinary peer-reviewed journal demonstrated &quot;no cases of CCL (cruciate ligament tear) diagnosed in intact males or females, but in early-neutered males and females the occurrences were 5 percent and 8 percent, respectively. Almost 10 percent of early-neutered males were diagnosed with LSA (lymphosarcoma), 3 times more than intact males. The percentage of HSA (hemangiosarcoma) cases in late-neutered females (about 8 percent) was 4 times more than intact and early-neutered females. There were no cases of MCT (mast cell tumor) in intact females, but the occurrence was nearly 6 percent in late-neutered females&quot;.

The second study from 2014 highlighted significant difference in closely related breeds (retrievers), suggesting that inter-breed variability is quite high and that sweeping legal measures and surgical mandates are not the best solutions to canine welfare and health. Specifically the study states: &quot;In Labrador Retrievers, where about 5 percent of gonadally intact males and females had one or more joint disorders, neutering at 6 months doubled the incidence of one or more joint disorders in both sexes. In male and female Golden Retrievers, with the same 5 percent rate of joint disorders in intact dogs, neutering at 6 months increased the incidence of a joint disorder to 4–5 times that of intact dogs. The incidence of one or more cancers in female Labrador Retrievers increased slightly above the 3 percent level of intact females with neutering. In contrast, in female Golden Retrievers, with the same 3 percent rate of one or more cancers in intact females, neutering at all periods through 8 years of age increased the rate of at least one of the cancers by 3–4 times. In male Golden and Labrador Retrievers neutering had relatively minor effects in increasing the occurrence of cancers.&quot;

In terms of behavior in dogs, separation anxiety, aggression, escape behavior and inappropriate elimination are reduced with neutering while noise phobia and sexual behavior has been shown to potentially increase. In males with aggression issues, earlier neutering may increase barking. In cats, asthma, gingivitis, and hyperactivity were decreased, while shyness was increased. In male cats, occurrence of abscesses, aggression toward veterinarians, sexual behaviors, and urine spraying was decreased, while hiding was increased.

==Health and behavioral effects==

===Advantages===
Besides being a birth control method, and being convenient to many owners, castrating/spaying has the following health benefits:
* Sexually dimorphic behaviors such as mounting and urine spraying are reduced due to the decrease in hormone levels brought about by neutering. In species other than dogs, certain forms of male aggression are also reduced. Sexual behavior in cats seems to make them especially undesirable to pet owners.
* Early spaying significantly reduces the risk of development of mammary tumours in female dogs. The incidence of mammary tumours in un-spayed female dogs is 71% (of which approximately 50% will be malignant and 50% will be benign), but if a dog is spayed before its first heat cycle, the risk of developing a mammary tumour is reduced to 0.35%—a 99.5% reduction. The positive effects of spaying on reduction of later mammary tumours decreases with each heat the dog has (backing up the contention that the greatest benefit to reduce future mammary tumour development is to spay before the first heat), and there is no added benefit to spaying to reduce recurrence of a mammary tumour once it has been diagnosed.
* Neutering increases life expectancy in cats: one study found castrated male cats live twice as long as intact males, while spayed female cats live 39% longer than intact females. Non-neutered cats in the U.S. are three times more likely to require treatment for an animal bite. Having a cat neutered confers health benefits, because castrated males cannot develop testicular cancer, spayed females cannot develop uterine, cervical or ovarian cancer, and both have a reduced risk of mammary cancer.
* Without the ability to reproduce, a female necessarily has zero risk of pregnancy complications, such as spotting and false pregnancy, the latter of which can occur in more than 50% of unspayed female dogs.
* Pyometra, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, and testicular cancer are prevented, as the susceptible organs are removed, though stump pyometra may still occur in spayed females.
* Pyometra (or a pus filled womb) (&#x27;Pyo&#x27; = pus; &#x27;metra&#x27; = uterus or womb) is a life-threatening condition that requires emergency veterinary treatment. The risk of a non-spayed female dog developing pyometra by age 10 is 25% across all breeds, but can be as high as 54% in some breeds. The treatment of choice for a closed-pyometra (where the cervix is closed and the pus cannot drain) is admission to hospital, commencement on intravenous fluids and appropriate antibiotics and, once stable enough for the anaesthetic and surgery, emergency removal of the infected pus-filled uterus. Medical management can be attempted if the animal&#x27;s condition allows (for example in the case of an &#x27;open&#x27; pyometra where the pus drains per-vaginum from the uterus via the open cervix) or dictates (where the animal is too old or otherwise unwell to withstand surgery), if the owner wishes to keep the dog entire to breed or if the owner is unable to afford the veterinary fees associated with surgery. Emergency removal of the infected uterus carries a much higher degree of risk of death than a routine &#x27;spay&#x27; operation. The risk of death from in dogs undergoing surgical treatment for pyometra is up to 17%. Thus the risk of death in entire female dogs from a pyometra, even if given correct veterinary attention can be up to 9% by 10 years of age (17% of 54%). This risk is reduced to virtually zero if spayed.

===Disadvantages===
* As with any surgical procedure, immediate complications of neutering include the usual anesthetic and surgical complications, such as bleeding, infection, and death. These risks are relatively low in routine neutering; however, they may be increased for some animals due to other pre-existing health factors. In one study the risk of anesthetic-related death (not limited to neutering procedures) was estimated at 0.05% for healthy dogs and 0.11% for healthy cats. The risks for sick animals were 1.33% for dogs and 1.40% for cats.
* Spaying and castrating cats and dogs may increase the risk of obesity if nutritional intake is not reduced to reflect the lower metabolic requirements of neutered animals. In cats, a decrease in sex hormone levels seems to be associated with an increase in food intake. In dogs, the effects of neutering as a risk factor for obesity vary among breeds.
* Neutered dogs of both sexes are at a twofold excess risk to develop osteosarcoma (bone cancer) as compared to intact dogs. The risk of osteosarcoma increases with increasing breed size and especially height.
* Studies of cardiac tumors in dogs showed that there was a 5 times greater risk of hemangiosarcoma (cancer of blood vessel lining), one of the three most common cancers in dogs, in spayed females than intact females and a 2.4 times greater risk of hemangiosarcoma in castrated dogs as compared to intact males.
* Spaying and castrating is associated with an increase in urinary tract cancers in dogs, however the risk is still less than 1%.
* Neutered dogs of both sexes have a 27% to 38% increased risk of adverse reactions to vaccinations. However, the incidence of adverse reactions for neutered and intact dogs combined is only 0.32%.
* Neutered dogs have been known to develop hormone-responsive alopecia (hair loss).
* A 2004 study found that neutered dogs had a higher incidence of cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) rupture, a form of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.
* A study of golden retrievers found that castrated males were 3 times more likely than intact males to be diagnosed with lymphoma and 2 times more likely to have hip dysplasia.
* Castration and spaying can increase the risk of geriatric cognitive impairment.
* About 2% of castrated male dogs eventually develop prostate cancer, compared to less than 0.6% of intact males. The evidence is most conclusive for Bouviers.
* In a study of 29 intact male dogs and 47 castrated males aged 11–14, the neutered males were significantly more likely to progress from one geriatric cognitive impairment condition (out of the four conditions – disorientation in the house or outdoors, changes in social interactions with human family members, loss of house training, and changes in the sleep-wake cycle) to two or more conditions. Testosterone in intact males is thought to slow the progression of cognitive impairment, at least in dogs that already have mild impairment.
* As compared to intact males, castrated cats are at an increased risk for certain problems associated with feline lower urinary tract disease. They are much more likely to suffer from feline cystitis which can escalate into a life-threatening urethral blockage.
* Neutering has been associated with an increased likelihood of urethral sphincter incontinence in male dogs.
* There is evidence that spaying can increase the risk of urinary incontinence in dogs, especially when done before the age of three months. Up until 12 months of age, the risk decreases as the age at spaying increases.
* Spayed female dogs are at an increased risk of hypothyroidism.

===Current research===
Various studies of the effects neutering has overall on male and female dog aggression have been unable to arrive at a consensus. A possible reason for this according to two studies is changes to other factors have more of an effect than neutering. One study reported results of aggression towards familiar and strange people and other dogs reduced between 10 and 60 percent of cases, while other studies reported increases in possessive aggression and aggression towards familiar and strange people, and more studies reported there was no significant difference in aggression risk between neutered and non-neutered males. For females with existing aggression, many studies reported increases in aggressive behavior and some found increased separation anxiety behavior. A report from the American Kennel Club Canine Health Foundation reported significantly more behavioral problems in castrated dogs. The most commonly observed behavioral problem in spayed females was fearful behavior and the most common problem in males was aggression. Early age gonadectomy is associated with an increased incidence of noise phobias and .

==Terminology for neutered animals==
A specialized vocabulary is used in animal husbandry and animal fancy for neutered (castrated) animals:











==Religious views==

===Islam===
There are differing views in Islam with regard to neutering animals, with some Islamic associations stating that when done to maintain the health and welfare of both the animals and the community, neutering is allowed on the basis of being in the interest of &#x27;maslaha&#x27; (general good) or &quot;choosing the lesser of two evils&quot;.

===Judaism===
Orthodox Judaism forbids the castration of both humans and non-human animals by Jews, except in lifesaving situations. In 2007, the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel Rabbi Shlomo Amar issued a ruling stating that it is permissible to have companion animals neutered on the basis of the Jewish mandate to prevent cruelty to animals.

<text>In mathematics, transformation geometry (or transformational geometry) is the name of a mathematical and pedagogic take on the study of geometry by focusing on groups of geometric transformations, and properties that are invariant under them. It is opposed to the classical synthetic geometry approach of Euclidean geometry, that focuses on proving theorems.

For example, within transformation geometry, the properties of an isosceles triangle are deduced from the fact that it is mapped to itself by a reflection about a certain line. This contrasts with the classical proofs by the criteria for congruence of triangles.

The first systematic effort to use transformations as the foundation of geometry was made by Felix Klein in the 19th century, under the name Erlangen programme. For nearly a century this approach remained confined to mathematics research circles. In the 20th century efforts were made to exploit it for mathematical education. Andrei Kolmogorov included this approach (together with set theory) as part of a proposal for geometry teaching reform in Russia. These efforts culminated in the 1960s with the general reform of mathematics teaching known as the New Math movement.

== Use in mathematics teaching ==
An exploration of transformation geometry often begins with a study of reflection symmetry as found in daily life. The first real transformation is &quot;reflection in a line&quot; or &quot;reflection against an axis&quot;. The composition of two reflections results in a rotation when the lines intersect, or a translation when they are parallel. Thus through transformations students learn about Euclidean plane isometry. For instance, consider reflection in a vertical line and a line inclined at 45° to the horizontal. One can observe that one composition yields a counter-clockwise quarter-turn (90°) while the reverse composition yields a clockwise quarter-turn. Such results show that transformation geometry includes non-commutative processes.

An entertaining application of reflection in a line occurs in a proof of the one-seventh area triangle found in any triangle.

Another transformation introduced to young students is the dilation. However, the reflection in a circle transformation seems inappropriate for lower grades. Thus inversive geometry, a larger study than grade school transformation geometry, is usually reserved for college students.

Experiments with concrete symmetry groups make way for abstract group theory. Other concrete activities use computations with complex numbers, hypercomplex numbers, or matrices to express transformation geometry.
Such transformation geometry lessons present an alternate view that contrasts with classical synthetic geometry. When students then encounter analytic geometry, the ideas of coordinate rotations and reflections follow easily. All these concepts prepare for linear algebra where the reflection concept is expanded.

Educators have shown some interest and described projects and experiences with transformation geometry for children from kindergarten to high school. In the case of very young age children, in order to avoid introducing new terminology and to make links with students&#x27; everyday experience with concrete objects, it was sometimes recommended to use words they are familiar with, like &quot;flips&quot; for line reflections, &quot;slides&quot; for translations, and &quot;turns&quot; for rotations, although these are not precise mathematical language. In some proposals, students start by performing with concrete objects before they perform the abstract transformations via their definitions of a mapping of each point of the figure.

In an attempt to restructure the courses of geometry in Russia, Kolmogorov suggested presenting it under the point of view of transformations, so the geometry courses were structured based on set theory. This led to the appearance of the term &quot;congruent&quot; in schools, for figures that were before called &quot;equal&quot;: since a figure was seen as a set of points, it could only be equal to itself, and two triangles that could be overlapped by isometries were said to be congruent.

One author expressed the importance of group theory to transformation geometry as follows:
:I have gone to some trouble to develop from first principles all the group theory that I need, with the intention that my book can serve as a first introduction to transformation groups, and the notions of abstract group theory if you have never seen these.

<doc id="473775" wikidata="Q2716519" url="?curid=473775" title="Injective module">
<text>In mathematics, especially in the area of abstract algebra known as module theory, an injective module is a module &quot;Q&quot; that shares certain desirable properties with the Z-module Q of all rational numbers. Specifically, if &quot;Q&quot; is a submodule of some other module, then it is already a direct summand of that module; also, given a submodule of a module &quot;Y&quot;, any module homomorphism from this submodule to &quot;Q&quot; can be extended to a homomorphism from all of &quot;Y&quot; to &quot;Q&quot;. This concept is dual to that of projective modules. Injective modules were introduced in and are discussed in some detail in the textbook .

Injective modules have been heavily studied, and a variety of additional notions are defined in terms of them: Injective cogenerators are injective modules that faithfully represent the entire category of modules. Injective resolutions measure how far from injective a module is in terms of the injective dimension and represent modules in the derived category. Injective hulls are maximal essential extensions, and turn out to be minimal injective extensions. Over a Noetherian ring, every injective module is uniquely a direct sum of indecomposable modules, and their structure is well understood. An injective module over one ring may be not injective over another, but there are well-understood methods of changing rings which handle special cases. Rings which are themselves injective modules have a number of interesting properties and include rings such as group rings of finite groups over fields. Injective modules include divisible groups and are generalized by the notion of injective objects in category theory.

== Definition ==

A left module &quot;Q&quot; over the ring &quot;R&quot; is injective if it satisfies one (and therefore all) of the following equivalent conditions:
* If &quot;Q&quot; is a submodule of some other left &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot;, then there exists another submodule &quot;K&quot; of &quot;M&quot; such that &quot;M&quot; is the internal direct sum of &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;K&quot;, i.e. &quot;Q&quot; + &quot;K&quot; = &quot;M&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; ∩ &quot;K&quot; = {0}.
* Any short exact sequence 0 →&quot;Q&quot; → &quot;M&quot; → &quot;K&quot; → 0 of left &quot;R&quot;-modules splits.
* If &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are left &quot;R&quot;-modules, &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is an injective module homomorphism and &quot;g&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Q&quot; is an arbitrary module homomorphism, then there exists a module homomorphism &quot;h&quot; : &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Q&quot; such that &quot;hf&quot; = &quot;g&quot;, i.e. such that the following diagram commutes:
* The contravariant Hom functor Hom(-,&quot;Q&quot;) from the category of left &quot;R&quot;-modules to the category of abelian groups is exact.

Injective right &quot;R&quot;-modules are defined in complete analogy.

== Examples ==
=== First examples ===

Trivially, the zero module {0} is injective.

Given a field &quot;k&quot;, every &quot;k&quot;-vector space &quot;Q&quot; is an injective &quot;k&quot;-module. Reason: if &quot;Q&quot; is a subspace of &quot;V&quot;, we can find a basis of &quot;Q&quot; and extend it to a basis of &quot;V&quot;. The new extending basis vectors span a subspace &quot;K&quot; of &quot;V&quot; and &quot;V&quot; is the internal direct sum of &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;K&quot;. Note that the direct complement &quot;K&quot; of &quot;Q&quot; is not uniquely determined by &quot;Q&quot;, and likewise the extending map &quot;h&quot; in the above definition is typically not unique.

The rationals Q (with addition) form an injective abelian group (i.e. an injective Z-module). The factor group Q/Z and the circle group are also injective Z-modules. The factor group Z/&quot;nZ for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1 is injective as a Z/&quot;nZ-module, but &quot;not&quot; injective as an abelian group.

=== Commutative examples ===

More generally, for any integral domain &quot;R&quot; with field of fractions &quot;K&quot;, the &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;K&quot; is an injective &quot;R&quot;-module, and indeed the smallest injective &quot;R&quot;-module containing &quot;R&quot;. For any Dedekind domain, the quotient module &quot;K&quot;/&quot;R&quot; is also injective, and its indecomposable summands are the localizations formula_1 for the nonzero prime ideals formula_2. The zero ideal is also prime and corresponds to the injective &quot;K&quot;. In this way there is a 1-1 correspondence between prime ideals and indecomposable injective modules.

A particularly rich theory is available for commutative noetherian rings due to Eben Matlis, . Every injective module is uniquely a direct sum of indecomposable injective modules, and the indecomposable injective modules are uniquely identified as the injective hulls of the quotients &quot;R&quot;/&quot;P&quot; where &quot;P&quot; varies over the prime spectrum of the ring. The injective hull of &quot;R&quot;/&quot;P&quot; as an &quot;R&quot;-module is canonically an &quot;R&quot;&quot;P&quot; module, and is the &quot;R&quot;&quot;P&quot;-injective hull of &quot;R&quot;/&quot;P&quot;. In other words, it suffices to consider local rings. The endomorphism ring of the injective hull of &quot;R&quot;/&quot;P&quot; is the completion formula_3 of &quot;R&quot; at &quot;P&quot;.

Two examples are the injective hull of the Z-module Z/&quot;p&quot;Z (the Prüfer group), and the injective hull of the &quot;k&quot;[&quot;x&quot;]-module &quot;k&quot; (the ring of inverse polynomials). The latter is easily described as &quot;k&quot;[&quot;x&quot;,&quot;x&quot;−1]/&quot;xk&quot;[&quot;x&quot;]. This module has a basis consisting of &quot;inverse monomials&quot;, that is &quot;x&quot;−&quot;n&quot; for &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, …. Multiplication by scalars is as expected, and multiplication by &quot;x&quot; behaves normally except that &quot;x&quot;·1 = 0. The endomorphism ring is simply the ring of formal power series.

=== Artinian examples ===

If &quot;G&quot; is a finite group and &quot;k&quot; a field with characteristic 0, then one shows in the theory of group representations that any subrepresentation of a given one is already a direct summand of the given one. Translated into module language, this means that all modules over the group algebra &quot;kG&quot; are injective. If the characteristic of &quot;k&quot; is not zero, the following example may help.

If &quot;A&quot; is a unital associative algebra over the field &quot;k&quot; with finite dimension over &quot;k&quot;, then Hom&quot;k&quot;(−, &quot;k&quot;) is a duality between finitely generated left &quot;A&quot;-modules and finitely generated right &quot;A&quot;-modules. Therefore, the finitely generated injective left &quot;A&quot;-modules are precisely the modules of the form Hom&quot;k&quot;(&quot;P&quot;, &quot;k&quot;) where &quot;P&quot; is a finitely generated projective right &quot;A&quot;-module. For symmetric algebras, the duality is particularly well-behaved and projective modules and injective modules coincide.

For any Artinian ring, just as for commutative rings, there is a 1-1 correspondence between prime ideals and indecomposable injective modules. The correspondence in this case is perhaps even simpler: a prime ideal is an annihilator of a unique simple module, and the corresponding indecomposable injective module is its injective hull. For finite-dimensional algebras over fields, these injective hulls are finitely-generated modules .

==== Computing injective hulls ====
If formula_4 is a Noetherian ring and formula_2 is a prime ideal, set formula_6 as the injective hull. The injective hull of formula_7 over the Artinian ring formula_8 can be computed as the module formula_9. It is a module of the same length as formula_8. In particular, for the standard graded ring formula_11 and formula_12, formula_13 is an injective module, giving the tools for computing the indecomposable injective modules for artinian rings over formula_14.

==== Self-injectivity ====
An Artin local ring formula_15 is injective over itself if and only if formula_16 is a 1-dimensional vector space over formula_17. This implies every local Gorenstein ring which is also Artin is injective over itself since has a 1-dimensional socle. A simple non-example is the ring formula_18 which has maximal ideal formula_19 and residue field formula_20. Its socle is formula_21, which is 2-dimensional. The residue field has the injective hull formula_22.

=== Modules over Lie algebras ===
For a Lie algebra formula_23 over a field formula_14 of characteristic 0, the category of modules formula_25 has a relatively straightforward description of its injective modules. Using the universal enveloping algebra any injective formula_23-module can be constructed from the formula_23-moduleformula_28for some formula_14-vector space formula_30. Note this vector space has a formula_23-module structure from the injectionformula_32In fact, every formula_23-module has an injection into some formula_28 and every injective formula_23-module is a direct summand of some formula_28.

== Theory ==

=== Structure theorem for commutative Noetherian rings ===
Over a commutative Noetherian ring formula_4, every injective module is a direct sum of indecomposable injective modules and every indecomposable injective module is the injective hull of the residue field at a prime formula_2. That is, for an injective formula_39 , there is an isomorphismformula_40where formula_41 are the injective hulls of the modules formula_42. In addition, if formula_43 is the injective hull of some module formula_44 then the formula_45 are the associated primes of formula_44.

=== Submodules, quotients, products, and sums, Bass-Papp Theorem===

Any product of (even infinitely many) injective modules is injective; conversely, if a direct product of modules is injective, then each module is injective . Every direct sum of finitely many injective modules is injective. In general, submodules, factor modules, or infinite direct sums of injective modules need not be injective. Every submodule of every injective module is injective if and only if the ring is Artinian semisimple ; every factor module of every injective module is injective if and only if the ring is hereditary, .

Bass-Papp Theorem states that every infinite direct sum of right (left) injective modules is injective if and only if the ring is right (left) Noetherian, .

===Baer&#x27;s criterion===

In Baer&#x27;s original paper, he proved a useful result, usually known as Baer&#x27;s Criterion, for checking whether a module is injective: a left &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;Q&quot; is injective if and only if any homomorphism &quot;g&quot; : &quot;I&quot; → &quot;Q&quot; defined on a left ideal &quot;I&quot; of &quot;R&quot; can be extended to all of &quot;R&quot;.

Using this criterion, one can show that Q is an injective abelian group (i.e. an injective module over Z). More generally, an abelian group is injective if and only if it is divisible. More generally still: a module over a principal ideal domain is injective if and only if it is divisible (the case of vector spaces is an example of this theorem, as every field is a principal ideal domain and every vector space is divisible). Over a general integral domain, we still have one implication: every injective module over an integral domain is divisible.

Baer&#x27;s criterion has been refined in many ways , including a result of and that for a commutative Noetherian ring, it suffices to consider only prime ideals &quot;I&quot;. The dual of Baer&#x27;s criterion, which would give a test for projectivity, is false in general. For instance, the Z-module Q satisfies the dual of Baer&#x27;s criterion but is not projective.

===Injective cogenerators===

Maybe the most important injective module is the abelian group Q/Z. It is an injective cogenerator in the category of abelian groups, which means that it is injective and any other module is contained in a suitably large product of copies of Q/Z. So in particular, every abelian group is a subgroup of an injective one. It is quite significant that this is also true over any ring: every module is a submodule of an injective one, or &quot;the category of left &quot;R&quot;-modules has enough injectives.&quot; To prove this, one uses the peculiar properties of the abelian group Q/Z to construct an injective cogenerator in the category of left &quot;R&quot;-modules.

For a left &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot;, the so-called &quot;character module&quot; &quot;M&quot;+ = HomZ(&quot;M&quot;,Q/Z) is a right &quot;R&quot;-module that exhibits an interesting duality, not between injective modules and projective modules, but between injective modules and flat modules . For any ring &quot;R&quot;, a left &quot;R&quot;-module is flat if and only if its character module is injective. If &quot;R&quot; is left noetherian, then a left &quot;R&quot;-module is injective if and only if its character module is flat.

===Injective hulls===

The injective hull of a module is the smallest injective module containing the given one and was described in .

One can use injective hulls to define a minimal injective resolution (see below). If each term of the injective resolution is the injective hull of the cokernel of the previous map, then the injective resolution has minimal length.

===Injective resolutions===
Every module &quot;M&quot; also has an injective resolution: an exact sequence of the form
:0 → &quot;M&quot; → &quot;I&quot;0 → &quot;I&quot;1 → &quot;I&quot;2 → ...
where the &quot;I&quot; &quot;j&quot; are injective modules. Injective resolutions can be used to define derived functors such as the Ext functor.

The &quot;length&quot; of a finite injective resolution is the first index &quot;n&quot; such that &quot;I&quot;&quot;n&quot; is nonzero and &quot;I&quot;&quot;i&quot; = 0 for &quot;i&quot; greater than &quot;n&quot;. If a module &quot;M&quot; admits a finite injective resolution, the minimal length among all finite injective resolutions of &quot;M&quot; is called its injective dimension and denoted id(&quot;M&quot;). If &quot;M&quot; does not admit a finite injective resolution, then by convention the injective dimension is said to be infinite. As an example, consider a module &quot;M&quot; such that id(&quot;M&quot;) = 0. In this situation, the exactness of the sequence 0 → &quot;M&quot; → &quot;I&quot;0 → 0 indicates that the arrow in the center is an isomorphism, and hence &quot;M&quot; itself is injective.

Equivalently, the injective dimension of &quot;M&quot; is the minimal integer (if there is such, otherwise ∞) &quot;n&quot; such that Ext(–,&quot;M&quot;) = 0 for all &quot;N&quot; &gt; &quot;n&quot;.

===Indecomposables===
Every injective submodule of an injective module is a direct summand, so it is important to understand indecomposable injective modules, .

Every indecomposable injective module has a local endomorphism ring. A module is called a &quot;uniform module&quot; if every two nonzero submodules have nonzero intersection. For an injective module &quot;M&quot; the following are equivalent:
* &quot;M&quot; is indecomposable
* &quot;M&quot; is nonzero and is the injective hull of every nonzero submodule
* &quot;M&quot; is uniform
* &quot;M&quot; is the injective hull of a uniform module
* &quot;M&quot; is the injective hull of a uniform cyclic module
* &quot;M&quot; has a local endomorphism ring

Over a Noetherian ring, every injective module is the direct sum of (uniquely determined) indecomposable injective modules. Over a commutative Noetherian ring, this gives a particularly nice understanding of all injective modules, described in . The indecomposable injective modules are the injective hulls of the modules &quot;R&quot;/&quot;p&quot; for &quot;p&quot; a prime ideal of the ring &quot;R&quot;. Moreover, the injective hull &quot;M&quot; of &quot;R&quot;/&quot;p&quot; has an increasing filtration by modules &quot;M&quot;&quot;n&quot; given by the annihilators of the ideals &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;, and &quot;M&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1/&quot;M&quot;&quot;n&quot; is isomorphic as finite-dimensional vector space over the quotient field &quot;k&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) of &quot;R&quot;/&quot;p&quot; to Hom&quot;R&quot;/&quot;p&quot;(&quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;/&quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1, &quot;k&quot;(&quot;p&quot;)).

===Change of rings===
It is important to be able to consider modules over subrings or quotient rings, especially for instance polynomial rings. In general, this is difficult, but a number of results are known, .

Let &quot;S&quot; and &quot;R&quot; be rings, and &quot;P&quot; be a left-&quot;R&quot;, right-&quot;S&quot; bimodule that is flat as a left-&quot;R&quot; module. For any injective right &quot;S&quot;-module &quot;M&quot;, the set of module homomorphisms Hom&quot;S&quot;( &quot;P&quot;, &quot;M&quot; ) is an injective right &quot;R&quot;-module. The same statement holds of course after interchanging left- and right- attributes.

For instance, if &quot;R&quot; is a subring of &quot;S&quot; such that &quot;S&quot; is a flat &quot;R&quot;-module, then every injective &quot;S&quot;-module is an injective &quot;R&quot;-module. In particular, if &quot;R&quot; is an integral domain and &quot;S&quot; its field of fractions, then every vector space over &quot;S&quot; is an injective &quot;R&quot;-module. Similarly, every injective &quot;R&quot;[&quot;x&quot;]-module is an injective &quot;R&quot;-module.

In the opposite direction, a ring homomorphism formula_47 makes &quot;R&quot; into a left-&quot;R&quot;, right-&quot;S&quot; bimodule, by left and right multiplication. Being free over itself &quot;R&quot; is also flat as a left &quot;R&quot;-module. Specializing the above statement for &quot;P = R&quot;, it says that when &quot;M&quot; is an injective right &quot;S&quot;-module the coinduced module formula_48 is an injective right &quot;R&quot;-module. Thus, coinduction over &quot;f&quot; produces injective &quot;R&quot;-modules from injective &quot;S&quot;-modules.

For quotient rings &quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot;, the change of rings is also very clear. An &quot;R&quot;-module is an &quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot;-module precisely when it is annihilated by &quot;I&quot;. The submodule ann&quot;I&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) = { &quot;m&quot; in &quot;M&quot; : &quot;im&quot; = 0 for all &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot; } is a left submodule of the left &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot;, and is the largest submodule of &quot;M&quot; that is an &quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot;-module. If &quot;M&quot; is an injective left &quot;R&quot;-module, then ann&quot;I&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) is an injective left &quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot;-module. Applying this to &quot;R&quot;=Z, &quot;I&quot;=&quot;nZ and &quot;M&quot;=Q/Z, one gets the familiar fact that Z/&quot;nZ is injective as a module over itself. While it is easy to convert injective &quot;R&quot;-modules into injective &quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot;-modules, this process does not convert injective &quot;R&quot;-resolutions into injective &quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot;-resolutions, and the homology of the resulting complex is one of the early and fundamental areas of study of relative homological algebra.

The textbook has an erroneous proof that localization preserves injectives, but a counterexample was given in .

===Self-injective rings===
Every ring with unity is a free module and hence is a projective as a module over itself, but it is rarer for a ring to be injective as a module over itself, . If a ring is injective over itself as a right module, then it is called a right self-injective ring. Every Frobenius algebra is self-injective, but no integral domain that is not a field is self-injective. Every proper quotient of a Dedekind domain is self-injective.

A right Noetherian, right self-injective ring is called a quasi-Frobenius ring, and is two-sided Artinian and two-sided injective, . An important module theoretic property of quasi-Frobenius rings is that the projective modules are exactly the injective modules.

== Generalizations and specializations ==
=== Injective objects ===
One also talks about injective objects in categories more general than module categories, for instance in functor categories or in categories of sheaves of O&quot;X&quot;-modules over some ringed space (&quot;X&quot;,O&quot;X&quot;). The following general definition is used: an object &quot;Q&quot; of the category &quot;C&quot; is injective if for any monomorphism &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; in &quot;C&quot; and any morphism &quot;g&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Q&quot; there exists a morphism &quot;h&quot; : &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Q&quot; with &quot;hf&quot; = &quot;g&quot;.

=== Divisible groups ===
The notion of injective object in the category of abelian groups was studied somewhat independently of injective modules under the term divisible group. Here a Z-module &quot;M&quot; is injective if and only if &quot;n&quot;⋅&quot;M&quot; = &quot;M&quot; for every nonzero integer &quot;n&quot;. Here the relationships between flat modules, pure submodules, and injective modules is more clear, as it simply refers to certain divisibility properties of module elements by integers.

=== Pure injectives ===
In relative homological algebra, the extension property of homomorphisms may be required only for certain submodules, rather than for all. For instance, a pure injective module is a module in which a homomorphism from a pure submodule can be extended to the whole module.

<text>Wasabi is a 2001 French action comedy film directed by Gérard Krawczyk and written and produced by Luc Besson. The film stars Jean Reno, Michel Muller and Ryōko Hirosue. In France, it was released as Wasabi, la petite moutarde qui monte au nez (&quot;Wasabi, the little mustard that gets right up your nose&quot;).

The film gets its title from a scene where the protagonist, Hubert Fiorentini (Reno), eats a whole serving of wasabi at a Japanese restaurant without flinching.

==Plot==
A woman (later revealed to be a transvestite), dancing provocatively to the enjoyment of other nightclub patrons, is abruptly hit in the face by Hubert Florentini (Reno), a commissaire of the French Police. Florentini drags her out of the club in handcuffs, assaulting other patrons who come too close to free the captive woman or attempt to hinder his exit. Unfortunately, one of these patrons includes the chief&#x27;s son.

Florentini is chastised for the violent and unorthodox methods that he uses to accomplish his goals and is put on paid leave from the force. Despite his success and his seemingly enjoyable lifestyle of fighting crime, playing golf, and being the object of a beautiful woman&#x27;s (Bouquet&#x27;s) attentions, he has been unable to forget his one true love, Miko, a Japanese spy he met 19 years prior. Upon receiving news of her death, he is summoned to Japan by her lawyer, Ishibashi (Haruhiko Hirata) for the reading of her will.

Ishibashi informs Florentini that he has inherited the guardianship of Yumi (Hirosue), a fiery, adorable and eccentric Japanese/French teenage girl over whom he has custody until she reaches adulthood in two days (the age of adulthood in Japan being 20). Yumi, who was led to believe she was the result of her mother&#x27;s rape and subsequent abandonment, hates her unknown father. Florentini realizes Yumi is his daughter, but does not tell her as she would probably flee from him.

Florentini uncovers evidence that Miko was the victim of foul play. He discovers that Miko had stolen a small fortune from the yakuza, a fortune now destined for Yumi upon reaching adulthood. Florentini summons the help of Momo (Michel Muller), a former intelligence colleague living in Tokyo. He helps Florentini with further investigations into Miko&#x27;s death and in guarding Yumi from the yakuza by supplying him with two metal suitcases of weapons. The yakuza try to attack Yumi in an arcade, but Florentini, who has been observing their positions, kills all of them.

Later, Yumi discovers that Florentini is her father as she is captured by the yakuza. As they take her away and prepare to execute Florentini, he uses golf balls to knock out his would-be executioners and knock out the rest in mêlée combat. With the help of former intelligence colleagues, Florentini and Momo free Yumi from her kidnappers when they attempt to withdraw money from Yumi&#x27;s bank account by replacing the bank&#x27;s staff and customers with their own men. During the rescue attempt a gunfight breaks out and all of the yakuza are killed by Florentini single-handedly without any casualties to the good guys.

Following the ordeal, Florentini takes a flight back to France, having promised Yumi he would be back in a month. But just before the plane takes off, a group of customs officers enter the cabin with two familiar metal suitcases in hand, asking for their owner.

==Reception==
&quot;Wasabi&quot; was met with mixed reviews, with a 43% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars, commenting that &quot;Reno does what he can in a thankless situation, the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again, and Ryoko Hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 53 out of 100, based on reviews from 15 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Despite some exhibitor expectations, it only opened in second place at the French box office, behind &quot;American Pie 2&quot;, with a gross of 18.6 million Francs ($2.7 million) for the week. It reached number one in its second week with a gross of 9.4 million Francs. It grossed $6.7 million in France and $10.4 million worldwide.

<text>Dream Harder is the sixth studio album by the Waterboys, released by Geffen Records on 24 May 1993. Led by Scottish singer-songwriter-instrumentalist Mike Scott, the album features none of the earlier UK-based band members and instead finds Scott backed by American session musicians. It was the last Waterboys album before Scott spent seven years pursuing a formal solo career, with &quot;Bring &#x27;Em All In&quot; (1995) and &quot;Still Burning&quot; (1997). The album reached position 171 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 charts, surpassing the previous Waterboys album &quot;Room to Roam&quot;, in spite of a less-than-enthusiastic response from critics to the album&#x27;s sound.

The album art was provided by the photography of Michael Halsband and John Hardin and the painting of Pal Shazar, under the direction of Frank Olinsky and Tom Zutaut.

&quot;Dream Harder&quot; was a return to a rock, or even hard rock, sound after the traditional Celtic-influenced preceding two albums. It did, however, continue the Waterboys&#x27; tradition of arranging a William Butler Yeats poem, in this case &quot;Love And Death&quot;. &quot;The Return of Pan&quot; is the Waterboys&#x27; second ode to the Greek deity, and the album contains a number of references to the romantic Neopaganism of Dion Fortune and the mystical Christianity of C. S. Lewis, as well as a tribute to guitarist Jimi Hendrix.

==Background==
Shortly before the release of the Waterboys&#x27; fifth studio album, &quot;Room to Roam&quot;, Mike Scott and his long-time band member Anthony Thistlethwaite decided they wanted to change the band&#x27;s musical direction by returning to their rock-orientated sound. As a result, the &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; line-up parted ways before the album&#x27;s tour and a new four-piece version of the band toured with a rock-dominated sound. Scott then looked for fresh inspiration by relocating from Ireland to Greenwich Village, New York, in September 1991. While most of the songs which appeared on &quot;Dream Harder&quot; were written when Scott was still living in Ireland, work on recording the album did not begin until January 1992, after Scott had signed a new record deal with Geffen Records. The label&#x27;s A&amp;R man suggested that Scott collaborate with producer Bill Price and they produced &quot;Dream Harder&quot; together. Scott told &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in 1993, &quot;Geffen knew I wanted to do a gung-ho rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll album and they suggested him. I like Bill, the decision made itself.&quot; He went on to summarise the material on &quot;Dream Harder&quot;, &quot;The record reflects what I was going through in 1991. My life was changing in a lot of ways, and that&#x27;s what I started writing about.&quot;

In 2024, Scott released a &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; version of the album on streaming platforms. Several tracks use previously unreleased Brendan O&#x27;Brien mixes from 1993 and the others were given a &quot;souped-up sound&quot; by Scott. The tracks &quot;Suffer&quot; and &quot;Spiritual City&quot; were replaced by &quot;Kiss the Wind&quot; and &quot;Workin&#x27; Out My Karma&quot;, and &quot;The New Life&quot; was restored to its original full length.

==Songs==
&quot;The New Life&quot;, one of many Scott songs which are both optimistic and touch upon spirituality, was written during April 1991 on the same night that he returned to Ireland from a three-week holiday in the Caribbean. Scott recalled, &quot;I&#x27;d been drinking very heavily for a while, and my wife packed me off on holiday and I stopped drinking. When I came back I felt great, like I was back in control of my own life, and that night I wrote &#x27;The New Life&#x27;.&quot; The lyrics of the song were influenced by the changes in Scott&#x27;s life at the time, such as the break-up of the &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; line-up, the end of his record deal with Chrysalis and the decision to leave Ireland. The song contains a phrase &quot;Are you under the mercy?&quot;, which Scott explains as &quot;a phrase I nicked from a Christian fan who wrote me a letter and signed off with &quot;under the mercy&quot;, which I took to mean (and this is what I intended in the song) &quot;under the mercy of spirit/the sacred/the presence of love&quot; – though Christians would say under the mercy of Christ&quot;.

&quot;Glastonbury Song&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single, backed by the songs &quot;Chalice Hill&quot;, &quot;Burlington Bertie And Accrington Stanley&quot;, and &quot;Corn Circle Symphony&quot;. Scott, discussing the song in 2003, described the song as &quot;one of the most commercial, radio-friendly songs musically that I&#x27;ve ever produced&quot;, and ascribes its lack of success to its theme, &quot;..the chorus is &#x27;I just found God where He always was&#x27;... In many countries it was successful, but in Britain, they wouldn&#x27;t play it because of the chorus.&quot;. James Heflin, the interviewer, notes that the song reached the Top 30 in the UK and was performed live on Top of the Pops broadcast on the BBC. The song was covered by Italian singer-songwriter Samuele Bersani, with new Italian lyrics, released under the title of &quot;Cosa vuoi da me&quot; (&quot;What do you want from me?&quot;) and included on his 1994 album &quot;Freak&quot; and released as a single a year later.

&quot;The Return of Pan&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first single, with the songs &quot;Karma&quot; (also the name of one of Scott&#x27;s earlier musical projects), &quot;Mister Powers&quot; and an untitled track. &quot;The Return of Pan&quot;&#x27;s lyrics recount an episode from Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;The Obsolescence of Oracles&quot;. Plutarch writes that, during the reign of Tiberius, a sailor named Thamus heard the following shouted to him from land; &quot;Thamus, are you there? When you reach Palodes, take care to proclaim that the great god Pan is dead.&quot; After retelling the story, the singer of &quot;The Return of Pan&quot; insists that &quot;The Great God Pan is alive!&quot;. The single charted at position twenty-four on the UK singles chart May 1993.

Scott has described &quot;Corn Circles&quot; as &quot;kind of a mischievous song&quot; and told the &quot;NME&quot; in 1993, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what the corn circles are. I&#x27;m just singing a song about them. They&#x27;re a great modern mysterly and they enchant me.&quot; &quot;Love and Death&quot; is a poem by William Butler Yeats. It first appeared in the 1885 &quot;Dublin University Review&quot;. Scott told &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;I sat at the piano and the tune just came to me. The poem&#x27;s so obscure that when we sent a tape to the Yeats Estate in Ireland for their approval, they couldn&#x27;t find it in their files.&quot; &quot;The Return of Jimi Hendrix&quot; was inspired by a dream Scott had while he was visiting New York with his wife in 1991, prior to moving there. Scott recalled, &quot;I&#x27;d been at a friend&#x27;s house watching videos of Jimi, that&#x27;s when I got turned on to him. I&#x27;d always liked him but he&#x27;d never been my main man. I watched these videos and was blown away. That night I had a dream and I just woke up and wrote it down. It was this incredible vision of all these modern-day characters in New York being freaked out by Jimi&#x27;s whammy-bar.&quot;

==Critical reception==

Upon its release, Mat Smith of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; praised &quot;Dream Harder&quot; as a &quot;truly momumental return to form&quot; and a &quot;psyche-altering explosion of spiritual fireworks&quot;. As a return to the band&#x27;s original rock-based sound, Smith described it as &quot;the album Waterboys fans have waited nearly eight years for&quot; and noted that the guitars, &quot;electric at last!&quot;, &quot;scream like a resurrectional chcoir beckoning [Scott] back through the paradisal gates&quot;. At the end of the year, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; placed the album at number 38 on their top 40 &quot;albums of the year&quot; list. Neil Spencer of &quot;The Observer&quot; considered the album to have a sound &quot;dominated by fretboard-throttling rock guitar&quot;. He added, &quot;While more appealing to a US audience, the new sound sits oddly with Scott&#x27;s pagan concerns, but Scott&#x27;s enthusiasm for thundering tunes and offbeat themes is infectious.&quot;

Robin Denselow of &quot;The Guardian&quot; felt that despite its &quot;New Yorkised production sheen&quot;, the album is &quot;still Scott-as-hippie-gypsy&quot;, with most of the songs having a &quot;starchild vein&quot; and a &quot;run-reading ambience&quot;. Stuart Bailie of the &quot;NME&quot; described the album as &quot;some party&quot; but not &quot;unconditionally great&quot;. He wrote, &quot;The problem with any party like &quot;Dream Harder&quot; is that you&#x27;ve got to bring along an open mind. You&#x27;ve got to accept the premise that Mike Scott has some kind of a vision, and allow him to tell you about it.&quot; He praised &quot;half a dozen&quot; of the songs as &quot;stupendous&quot;, including &quot;Glastonbury Song&quot; and &quot;Preparing to Fly&quot;, but was a little more critical of some others, such as the Marillion-sounding &quot;Love and Death&quot;, &quot;Corn Circles&quot;, which he felt is &quot;a bit silly in the wake of three magical songs&quot;, and &quot;Spiritual City&quot;, which &quot;comes across like Neil from &quot;The Young Ones&quot; doing &#x27;Hole in My Shoe&#x27;.&quot;

In the US, John Swenson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt &quot;Dream Harder&quot; was the band&#x27;s &quot;most fully realized album&quot; at the time. Troy J. Augusto of &quot;Cash Box&quot; selected &quot;Dream Harder&quot; as his &quot;Pick of the Week&quot; in June 1993. He believed Scott sounded &quot;more confident and emotive than ever&quot;, with the album containing a &quot;bold new edge&quot; and &quot;no filler&quot;. Jim Farber of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described it as &quot;straight-on rock&quot; and added, &quot;Moments entice, but mostly &quot;Dream Harder&quot; shows what could&#x27;ve happened to U2 if they never lightened up.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; were more mixed in their review, commenting, &quot;Scott returns to basics with a slightly subdued recap of the style with which he rose to prominence. Problem is that his instrumental foils are largely undistinguished, and sidesteps into folk, middle Eastern and mild reggae don&#x27;t display much punch.&quot; In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic considered the album to be a return to the &quot;big rock sound of earlier albums like &quot;This is the Sea&quot;&quot; but felt the material did not &quot;carry the same weight&quot; as that on the band&#x27;s previous two albums.

<doc id="473779" wikidata="Q1625040" url="?curid=473779" title="Injective object">
<text>In mathematics, especially in the field of category theory, the concept of injective object is a generalization of the concept of injective module. This concept is important in cohomology, in homotopy theory and in the theory of model categories. The dual notion is that of a projective object.

==Definition==
An object formula_1 in a category formula_2 is said to be injective if for every monomorphism formula_3 and every morphism formula_4 there exists a morphism formula_5 extending formula_6 to formula_7, i.e. such that formula_8.

That is, every morphism formula_9 factors through every monomorphism formula_10.

The morphism formula_11 in the above definition is not required to be uniquely determined by formula_12 and formula_6.

In a locally small category, it is equivalent to require that the hom functor formula_14 carries monomorphisms in formula_2 to surjective set maps.

==In Abelian categories==
The notion of injectivity was first formulated for abelian categories, and this is still one of its primary areas of application. When formula_2 is an abelian category, an object &quot;Q&quot; of formula_2 is injective if and only if its hom functor HomC(–,&quot;Q&quot;) is exact.

If formula_18 is an exact sequence in formula_2 such that &quot;Q&quot; is injective, then the sequence splits.

==Enough injectives and injective hulls==
The category formula_2 is said to &quot;have enough injectives&quot; if for every object &quot;X&quot; of formula_2, there exists a monomorphism from &quot;X&quot; to an injective object. 

A monomorphism &quot;g&quot; in formula_2 is called an essential monomorphism if for any morphism &quot;f&quot;, the composite &quot;fg&quot; is a monomorphism only if &quot;f&quot; is a monomorphism.

If &quot;g&quot; is an essential monomorphism with domain &quot;X&quot; and an injective codomain &quot;G&quot;, then &quot;G&quot; is called an injective hull of &quot;X&quot;. The injective hull is then uniquely determined by &quot;X&quot; up to a non-canonical isomorphism.

==Examples==
*In the category of abelian groups and group homomorphisms, Ab, an injective object is necessarily a divisible group. Assuming the axiom of choice, the notions are equivalent.
*In the category of (left) modules and module homomorphisms, &quot;R&quot;-Mod, an injective object is an injective module. &quot;R&quot;-Mod has injective hulls (as a consequence, &quot;R&quot;-Mod has enough injectives).
*In the category of metric spaces, Met, an injective object is an injective metric space, and the injective hull of a metric space is its tight span.
*In the category of T0 spaces and continuous mappings, an injective object is always a Scott topology on a continuous lattice, and therefore it is always sober and locally compact.

==Uses==
If an abelian category has enough injectives, we can form injective resolutions, i.e. for a given object &quot;X&quot; we can form a long exact sequence
:formula_23
and one can then define the derived functors of a given functor &quot;F&quot; by applying &quot;F&quot; to this sequence and computing the homology of the resulting (not necessarily exact) sequence. This approach is used to define Ext, and Tor functors and also the various cohomology theories in group theory, algebraic topology and algebraic geometry. The categories being used are typically functor categories or categories of sheaves of &quot;O&quot;&quot;X&quot; modules over some ringed space (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;O&quot;&quot;X&quot;) or, more generally, any Grothendieck category.

== Generalization ==
Let formula_2 be a category and let formula_25 be a class of morphisms of formula_2.

An object formula_1 of formula_2 is said to be &quot;formula_25&quot;-injective if for every morphism formula_30 and every morphism formula_31 in formula_25 there exists a morphism formula_33 with formula_34.

If formula_25 is the class of monomorphisms, we are back to the injective objects that were treated above.

The category formula_2 is said to &quot;have enough formula_25-injectives&quot; if for every object &quot;X&quot; of formula_2, there exists an &quot;formula_25&quot;-morphism from &quot;X&quot; to an &quot;formula_25&quot;-injective object.

A &quot;formula_25&quot;-morphism &quot;g&quot; in formula_2 is called &quot;formula_25&quot;-essential if for any morphism &quot;f&quot;, the composite &quot;fg&quot; is in &quot;formula_25&quot; only if &quot;f&quot; is in &quot;formula_25&quot;.

If &quot;g&quot; is a &quot;formula_25&quot;-essential morphism with domain &quot;X&quot; and an &quot;formula_25&quot;-injective codomain &quot;G&quot;, then &quot;G&quot; is called an formula_25-injective hull of &quot;X&quot;. 

=== Examples of -injective objects===

*In the category of simplicial sets, the injective objects with respect to the class &quot;formula_25&quot; of anodyne extensions are Kan complexes.
*In the category of partially ordered sets and monotone maps, the complete lattices form the injective objects for the class &quot;formula_25&quot; of order-embeddings, and the Dedekind–MacNeille completion of a partially ordered set is its &quot;formula_25&quot;-injective hull.

<text>Beat Martin Raaflaub (born 19 August 1946 in Winterthur) is a Swiss conductor. He is the brother of Kurt Raaflaub, Professor of Classics and History at Brown University.

He grew up in Basel and Cameroon and studied German and history at the University of Basel where he graduated as a doctor in modern Swiss history in 1977. At the same time, he became a concert singer after having studied with Fritz Näf. Finally, the Basel Conservatory issued Raaflaub the diploma for &quot;Teaching School Music&quot; and &quot;Choir Direction&quot;. In 1976 he was nominated Director of the &quot;Jugendmusikschule Muttenz&quot; near Basel.

Since 1979 he has managed two other choirs as a musical director, the &quot;Choir St. Arbogast Muttenz&quot; and the &quot;Chamber Choir Bülach&quot; (&quot;Kammerchor Zürcher Unterland&quot;). He gives concerts with both choirs in all parts of Switzerland.

In 1983 Raaflaub took over the musical direction of the Basel Boys Choir (&quot;Knabenkantorei Basel&quot;). Many recordings for radio and television were produced with his choirs. He gave concerts with his Boys Choir in Europe, in the United States, in South Africa and in Brazil. Several CD recordings were produced under his direction.

Additionally, Raaflaub teaches young conductors at the &quot;Music Academy Basel&quot;. He also presents regularly the radio show &quot;Sing mit&quot; at the Swiss &quot;Radio DRS&quot;. Raaflaub is an important artistic counsellor of the European Youth Choir Festival.

<doc id="473797" wikidata="Q7289900" url="?curid=473797" title="Ramona (novel series)">
<text>The Ramona books are a series of eight children&#x27;s novels by Beverly Cleary that center on Ramona Quimby, her family and friends. The first book, &quot;Beezus and Ramona&quot;, appeared in 1955. The final book, &quot;Ramona&#x27;s World&quot;, was published in 1999. Two books in the series were named Newbery Honor books, &quot;Ramona and Her Father&quot; and &quot;Ramona Quimby, Age 8&quot;. &quot;Ramona and Her Mother&quot; received the National Book Award. Sometimes known as the Beezus and Ramona series, as of 2012, the books were being marketed by HarperCollins as &quot;The Complete Ramona Collection&quot;.

==Background==

The Ramona books grew out of Cleary&#x27;s earlier Henry Huggins series and take place in the same neighborhood. In the Henry Huggins books Beezus was one of Henry&#x27;s friends, and her younger sister Ramona was generally a pest to Henry, Beezus and the other children.

It occurred to Cleary (while writing &quot;Henry Huggins&quot;) that all of the characters she had created thus far had no brothers or sisters. &quot;Someone should have a sibling,&quot; she wrote in &quot;My Own Two Feet&quot;, &quot;so I tossed in a little sister to explain Beezus&#x27;s nickname. When it came time to name the sister, I overheard a neighbor call out to another whose name was Ramona. I wrote in &quot;Ramona,&quot; made several references to her, gave her one brief scene, and thought that was the end of her. Little did I dream, to use a trite expression from books of my childhood, that she would take over books of her own.&quot;

In 1955, after finishing three Henry books, Cleary wrote &quot;Beezus and Ramona&quot;, a novel in which Beezus was the central character. The plot revolved around fourth grade Beezus&#x27; frustrations with her younger sister. Then in 1968, having concluded the Henry Huggins series, Cleary returned to focus on the two sisters in &quot;Ramona the Pest&quot;. It became the foundation book of the Ramona series. As publisher, writer and reviewer Anita Silvey says, &quot;It was almost inevitable that Cleary would publish a series of books about this boisterous yet appealing character.&quot;

&quot;Ramona the Pest&quot;, like the remaining books in the series, is written from Ramona&#x27;s point of view. In &quot;Ramona the Pest&quot; Ramona enters kindergarten. The succeeding books follow her as she grows up and advances through school, usually at the rate of one grade over two books. Written from the 1950s through the 1990s, dates aren&#x27;t mentioned in the books, and the children are designed to appeal to real children in any time period. The last Ramona book, &quot;Ramona&#x27;s World&quot;, was published in 1999, 15 years after the previous one.

==Series==

;&quot;Beezus and Ramona&quot; (1955)
:This is the only book in the series written from older sister Beezus&#x27; point of view. In the book, Beezus is struggling with her feelings for her annoying younger sister Ramona. Ramona exasperates Beezus with her high spirits and wild imagination. Ramona scribbles all over a library book, gets Ribsy locked in the bathroom, and disrupts Beezus&#x27; art class. Finally Beezus realizes it is possible to love her sister, even when she doesn&#x27;t always like her.
;&quot;Ramona the Pest&quot; (1968)
:Ramona and her neighbor Howie are going to kindergarten, and Miss Binney is their teacher. Ramona knows that she has been described as a pest, but she doesn&#x27;t see herself that way, and in this book she tries very hard to be good and follow the rules. But sometimes she has a difficult time controlling herself, and one day she gets sent home from school for pulling her classmate&#x27;s hair. Convinced her teacher doesn&#x27;t like her, Ramona refuses to return until a very special letter from her teacher brings her back.
;&quot;Ramona the Brave&quot; (1975)
:Ramona sees herself as fearless, and is sometimes surprised to realize that others don&#x27;t agree. It&#x27;s the summer after kindergarten, and things are changing at the Quimby house. Ramona prepares to enter the first grade, Mrs. Quimby has a part-time job, and the family is having an extra bedroom added on to the house. Ramona bravely confronts bullies at the play ground and a mean dog on her way to school, but she isn&#x27;t prepared for how scary it feels going to sleep in the brand new bedroom - alone.
;&quot;Ramona and Her Father&quot; (1977)
:Mr. Quimby loses his job and Ramona, now in the second grade, has some great ideas on how to earn some extra money to help out. She also decides it&#x27;s time he stopped smoking, and she&#x27;ll help him with that, too. By the time the church Christmas pageant arrives Ramona is feeling neglected. But the evening she was dreading turns into a success that brings the family together again. This installment was a Newbery Honor book.
;&quot;Ramona and Her Mother&quot; (1979)
:Still in the second grade, Ramona starts to become jealous of her mother and Beezus, because they seem to share things she can&#x27;t, like sewing and cooking. She&#x27;s too young to stay home alone when her parents are at work, but she&#x27;s tired of going to the Kemps&#x27; after school.

==Ramona&#x27;s characterization==

Librarian Kathleen Odean appreciates Ramona&#x27;s fearless attitude, calling her &quot;irrepressible&quot; and saying &quot;She represents the kind of girl who has not been subdued by adults or the world in general.&quot; &quot;Twentieth-Century Children&#x27;s Writers&quot; cites Ramona&#x27;s &quot;spunk, her impermeable but often ambivalent bond to Beezus, and her unsurpassed creativity... (Cleary) never sacrifices Ramona&#x27;s integrity or intelligence&quot;.

Part of the appeal of the series is watching Ramona grow up. Cleary&#x27;s writing has been praised for its ability to show her main character maturing: &quot;Throughout the series, Cleary depicts Ramona&#x27;s emotional development as well as her adventures and misadventures.&quot; Anita Silvey calls Ramona &quot;Cleary&#x27;s most developed characterization, a child at once ordinary and extraordinary.&quot;

==Critical reception==

Generally critics have been positive about all the Ramona books, pointing out the pleasure readers derive from watching Ramona grow up in the series. &quot;Cleary outlines Ramona&#x27;s joys and sorrows in a manner considered both poignant and hilarious&quot; In &quot;Twentieth-Century Children&#x27;s Writers&quot;, Cathryn Mercier praises Cleary&#x27;s accomplishments through the series as a whole. &quot;Through Ramona, Cleary touches young readers on an emotional level which engages and challenges, but does not overwhelm. Her ability to sustain their attention over time, from book to book, remains an accomplishment beyond evaluation.&quot;

Though now considered a standard for realistic children&#x27;s fiction, Beverly Cleary&#x27;s books were unique in their time. &quot;Ramona&#x27;s complexity was something unusual in children&#x27;s literature. Seen through the eyes of any other character, she could be a real nuisance. But when Cleary wrote from Ramona&#x27;s point of view, all of the little girl&#x27;s actions made perfect sense.&quot; They are still valued today, as Julia Doubt writes, and read around the world. &quot;It is greatly significant that today the Ramona series still sells in many languages and countries across the globe - reaching out to ordinary kids (and their annoying little sisters) - and their extraordinary common misunderstandings about the world - everywhere.&quot; As &quot;The Essential Guide to Children&#x27;s Books and Their Creators&quot; says, Beverly Cleary &quot;remains one of those rare authors who are both critically acclaimed and immensely popular with young readers.&quot;

==Adaptations==

Cleary&#x27;s Ramona books have been adapted for Canadian television as &quot;Ramona&quot;. The 10-part Canadian television series starred Sarah Polley as Ramona and Lori Chodos as Beezus.

They were also made into the American movie &quot;Ramona and Beezus&quot;, released on July 23, 2010, starring Joey King as Ramona and Selena Gomez as Beezus. Although the film jumps from book to book, the plot mainly focuses on the seventh book in the series, &quot;Ramona Forever&quot;.

==Characters==
;The Quimbys and Kemps
*Ramona Geraldine Quimby: The main character. She has straight, short brown hair and an active imagination. Her middle name is Geraldine.
*Beatrice &quot;Beezus&quot; Quimby: Ramona&#x27;s sensible, big sister, whose nickname comes from Ramona&#x27;s babyhood mispronunciation of her name. She was named after Aunt Beatrice. Her middle name is Ann. While she supports and loves Ramona, she can misunderstand and be frustrated by her actions. 
* Mr. Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Quimby: Ramona&#x27;s father, who loves to draw, and remembers to bring home gummy bears and new Pink Pearl erasers for the girls. He works at sometimes unpleasant jobs to support the family, but wants to be a teacher; Ramona suggests he should be a cartoonist.
*Mrs. Dorothy Quimby (née Day): Ramona&#x27;s mother, who works as a bookkeeper for a doctor. She is calm and practical, and much like Beezus in temperament, though she also has a deep and loving bond with Ramona.
*Aunt Beatrice Day-Kemp: Mrs. Quimby&#x27;s sister, who is a teacher, and Beezus&#x27; favorite aunt and ideal adult. She marries Hobart Kemp later in the series. She is imaginative and carefree and tells the girls that she was remarkably like Ramona as a child. (Note that the sisters&#x27; maiden name was &quot;Haswell&quot; in the book &quot;Beezus and Ramona&quot;.)
*Grandpa Day: Mrs. Quimby and Aunt Bea&#x27;s dad, who helps planned Aunt Bea&#x27;s wedding. His wife Grandma Day died before the first book, so Ramona probably met her, but was too young to remember. 
*Roberta Quimby: Beezus and Ramona&#x27;s baby sister, who is born at the end of &quot;Ramona Forever&quot;. Ramona is jealous that Roberta has all her parents&#x27; attention, but at the end of &quot;Ramona&#x27;s World&quot; learns to love her sister. Her middle name is Day.
*Picky-picky: The Quimbys&#x27; elderly cat. He usually avoids Ramona, because, as Mrs. Quimby explains, he has grown grouchy in his old age and because Ramona was rough with him when she was little. As she gets older, he comes to trust her more, even curling up on the couch with her when she&#x27;s sick. He dies in Ramona Forever, and the sisters bury him.
*Howie Kemp: Ramona&#x27;s friend who loves building things. He becomes Ramona&#x27;s cousin-in-law in &quot;Ramona Forever&quot; when his Uncle Hobart marries her Aunt Beatrice. He never gets excited about anything, which really makes Ramona disappointed. 
*Willa Jean Kemp: Howie&#x27;s bratty little sister, who is frequently thrust on Ramona. People say that she is very like Ramona when she was little; however, Willa Jean does not seem to possess Ramona&#x27;s imagination. 
*Mrs. Kemp: Howie&#x27;s mother.
*Mr. Kemp: Howie&#x27;s father.
*Grandma Kemp: Howie&#x27;s grandmother, who lives in the same house and watches Ramona, Howie, Willa Jean and sometimes Beezus after school.
*Uncle Hobart Kemp: Howie&#x27;s uncle who marries Ramona&#x27;s aunt, Beatrice. He is Mr. Kemp&#x27;s younger brother. He makes his only appearance in &quot;Ramona Forever&quot;.

;The Huggins family

*Mr. Huggins: Henry&#x27;s father.
*Mrs. Huggins: Henry&#x27;s mother.
*Ribsy: Henry&#x27;s dog.
*Nosy: Henry&#x27;s cat.

;The Kidds
*Daisy Kidd: Ramona&#x27;s first friend in fourth grade. She&#x27;s called &#x27;Fence-face&#x27; by her brother because of the bands on her back teeth.
* Mrs. Kidd: Daisy&#x27;s mother. She is a nice, plump woman. Ramona likes her.
*Mr. Kidd: Daisy&#x27;s father.
*Jeremy Kidd: Daisy&#x27;s big brother. Daisy calls him &#x27;Germy.&#x27; Ramona once called him Prince. Beezus has a little crush on him in &quot;Ramona&#x27;s World,&quot; and he returns it.
*Clawed: Jeremy Kidd&#x27;s cat, a stray that he found and adopted.

;Klickitat Street
*Scooter McCarthy: Henry&#x27;s friend who often irritates Henry and Beezus with his upperclassman attitudes.
*Eva McCarthy: Scooter&#x27;s mother.
*Robert: Henry&#x27;s best friend.
*Mrs. Swink: An elderly lady who wears pants suits and calls Ramona &quot;Juanita&quot;. Mrs. Swink was also who inspired Ramona and Howie to make tin can stilts in “Ramona and Her Father”
*The Grumbies: An older couple who doesn&#x27;t like Ribsy, Henry&#x27;s dog, because he likes to chase their cat.
*Mrs. Pitt: One of Ramona&#x27;s neighbors who lives in front of the bus stop. She doesn&#x27;t like kids who throw trash in her yard.
*Mrs. Peabody: A lady who was Henry&#x27;s neighbor; her dog Ranger was unfriendly to them. She called Henry &quot;Harry Higgins&quot; in Henry and the Clubhouse until Ramona corrected her.
*Ranger: Mrs. Peabody&#x27;s dog.

;Glenwood and Cedarhurst Schools
*Danny &quot;Yard Ape&quot;: A boy who always annoys Ramona, and whom she secretly likes.
*Susan Kushner: Ramona&#x27;s former rival, who seemed perfect and was revealed to be boring. Ramona was very tempted to pull her reddish-brown curls in kindergarten to make them bounce.

<text>Armagh ( ; , , &quot;Macha&#x27;s height&quot;) is a city and the county town of County Armagh, in Northern Ireland, as well as a civil parish. It is the ecclesiastical capital of Ireland – the seat of the Archbishops of Armagh, the Primates of All Ireland for both the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Ireland. In ancient times, nearby Navan Fort () was a pagan ceremonial site and one of the great royal capitals of Gaelic Ireland. Today, Armagh is home to two cathedrals (both named after Saint Patrick) and the Armagh Observatory, and is known for its Georgian architecture.

Statistically classed as a medium-sized town by NISRA. Armagh was given city status in 1994 and Lord Mayoralty status in 2012. It had a population of 16,310 people in the 2021 Census.

==History==

===Foundation===
&quot;Eamhain Mhacha&quot; (or Navan Fort), at the western edge of Armagh, was an ancient pagan ritual or ceremonial site. According to Irish mythology it was one of the great royal sites of Gaelic Ireland and the capital of Ulster. It appears to have been largely abandoned after the 1st century. In the 3rd century, a ditch and bank was dug around the top of Cathedral Hill, the heart of what is now Armagh. Its circular shape matches the modern street layout. Evidence suggests that it was a pagan sanctuary and the successor to Navan. Like Navan, it too was named after the goddess Macha: &quot;Ard Mhacha&quot;, meaning &quot;Macha&#x27;s height&quot;. This name was later anglicised as &quot;Ardmagh&quot;, which eventually became &quot;Armagh&quot;. Navan and Armagh were linked by an ancient road which passes over Mullacreevie hill.

After Christianity spread to Ireland, the pagan sanctuary was converted into a Christian one, and Armagh became the site of an important church and monastery. According to tradition, Saint Patrick founded his main church there in the year 445, and it eventually became the head church of Ireland. Muirchú writes that a pagan chieftain named Dáire would not let Patrick build a church on the hill of Ard Mhacha, but instead gave him lower ground to the east. One day, Dáire&#x27;s horses died after grazing on the church land. He told his men to kill Patrick, but was himself struck down with illness. They begged Patrick to heal him, and Patrick&#x27;s holy water revived both Dáire and his horses. Dáire rewarded Patrick with a great bronze cauldron and gave him the hill of Ard Mhacha to build a church. Dáire has similarities with the Irish god the Dagda.

===Medieval era===
By the 7th century, Armagh had become the site of the most important church, monastery and monastic school in the north of Ireland. The &quot;Book of Armagh&quot; was produced in the monastery in the early 9th century and contains some of the oldest surviving specimens of Old Irish.

Armagh was at the heart of the kingdom of the Airthir, a part of the Airgíalla federation. The church at Armagh looked to both the Airthir and neighbouring Uí Néill for patronage. The Uí Néill High King, Niall Caille (Niall of the Callan), was buried at Armagh in 846 after drowning in the River Callan. His son, High King Áed Findliath, had a house at Armagh.

The first Viking raids on Armagh were recorded in 832, with three in one month, and it suffered at least ten Viking raids over the following century. A hoard seemingly lost by Vikings in the River Blackwater shows the high quality of metalwork being made in Armagh at this time.

Brian Boru, High King of Ireland, visited Armagh in 1004, acknowledging it as the head church of Ireland and bestowing it a large sum of gold. Brian was buried at Armagh cathedral after his death at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. Armagh&#x27;s claim to being the head church of Ireland was formally acknowledged at the Synod of Ráth Breasail in 1111. The 1171 Council of Armagh freed all Englishmen and women who were enslaved in Ireland.

Following the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland, Armagh was attacked by Anglo-Normans led by Philip de Worcester in 1185 and by John de Courcy in 1189. It was also raided by Ruaidrí mac Duinn Sléibe of Ulaid in 1196 and 1199.

Archbishop Máel Patraic Ua Scannail rebuilt Armagh cathedral in 1268 and founded a Franciscan friary, whose remains can still be seen. There was also a small Culdee community in Armagh until the 16th century.

===Early modern era===

During the 16th century Tudor conquest of Ireland, Armagh suffered greatly in the conflict between the English and the O&#x27;Neills. Armagh was strategically important as it lay between the English Pale and the O&#x27;Neill heartland of Tyrone, and the town changed hands many times during the wars. In the 1560s, English troops under Thomas Radclyffe occupied and fortified the town, which was then attacked and largely destroyed by Shane O&#x27;Neill. After the Battle of the Yellow Ford in 1598, the routed English army took refuge at Armagh before surrendering to Hugh O&#x27;Neill. By the end of the Nine Years&#x27; War, Armagh lay in ruins, as shown on Richard Bartlett&#x27;s 1601 map.

Following the Nine Years&#x27; War, Armagh came under English dominance and the cathedral came under the control of the Protestant Church of Ireland. The cathedral was rebuilt under Archbishop Christopher Hampton and the town began to be settled by Protestants from Britain, as part of the Plantation of Ulster. During the Irish Rebellion of 1641, many British settlers fled to Armagh cathedral for safety. After negotiations with the besieged settlers, Catholic rebels under Felim O&#x27;Neill occupied the town. In May 1642, following several rebel defeats and massacres by settlers elsewhere, the rebels in Armagh seized the settlers&#x27; property and set fire to the town.

===Modern era===

The parliamentary borough of Armagh was a two-seat constituency in the Irish House of Commons prior to 1801. It continued as a one-seat constituency in the United Kingdom House of Commons from 1801 to 1885. It had a municipal corporation which was abolished under the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840.

Armagh has been an educational centre since the time of Saint Patrick, and thus it has been referred to as &quot;the city of saints and scholars&quot;. The educational tradition continued with the foundation of the Royal School in 1608, St Patrick&#x27;s College in 1834 and the Armagh Observatory in 1790. The Observatory was part of Archbishop Lord Rokeby&#x27;s plan to have a university in the city. This ambition was finally fulfilled, albeit briefly, in the 1990s when Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast opened an outreach centre in the former hospital building.

The Catch-my-Pal Protestant Total Abstinence Union was founded in 1909 in Armagh by the minister of 3rd Armagh (now The Mall) Presbyterian Church, Rev. Robert Patterson. Although relatively short-lived it was very successful for that time, attracting many tens of thousands of members. It was influential in the development of a &quot;two-community&quot; narrative in Ulster which was important in the Ulster Unionist campaign during the Home Rule Crisis. A blue plaque historical marker commemorating Rev. Patterson was erected on The Mall in 2019.

Three brothers from Armagh died at the Battle of the Somme during World War I. None of the three has a known grave and all are commemorated on the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme. A fourth brother was wounded in the same attack.

On 14 January 1921, during the Irish War of Independence, a Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) sergeant was assassinated by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in Armagh. He was attacked with a grenade as he walked along Market Street and later died of his wounds. On 4 September 1921, republican leaders Michael Collins and Eoin O&#x27;Duffy addressed a large meeting in Armagh, which was attended by up to 10,000 people.

During the Troubles in Armagh, the violence was substantial enough for a stretch of road on the outskirts of the city to be referred to by one RUC officer as &quot;Murder Mile&quot;. Over the span of 36 years, although mainly concentrated in the years from 1969 until 1994, the small city, including some outlying areas, saw 86 deaths in the Troubles, including those of a number of people from the city who died elsewhere in Troubles-related incidents. Armagh City Hall, which had been built as the Tontine Buildings in 1828 and converted into a municipal building in 1910, was badly damaged in a bomb attack on 27 September 1972 and subsequently demolished.

==City status==

As the seat of the Primate of All Ireland, Armagh was historically regarded as a city, and recognisably had the status by 1226. It had no charter granted but claimed the title by prescription, and was later formerly chartered as a borough in 1613 under James I; Acts of the Parliament of Ireland in 1773 and 1791 refer to the &quot;City of Armagh&quot;. Armagh lost the status with the abolition of its city corporation by the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840 after it was deemed ineffective and unrepresentative of its population. From 1953, Armagh began to argue for the restoration of the status lost in 1840, with several applications to the Home Office being made.

The council used the appellation &quot;city&quot; unofficially until 1994 when, at Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s personal request, Armagh along with the Welsh town of St Davids was awarded the status. Charles, Prince of Wales during a visit in July 1994 announced it had been granted to mark the 1,550th anniversary of the traditional date of Armagh&#x27;s foundation by Saint Patrick, and also &quot;in recognition of [Armagh&#x27;s and St Davids&#x27;] important Christian heritage and their status as cities in the last century&quot;.

The award of city status is typically granted to a local authority body, and the letters patent was initially presented to dignitaries and Armagh District Council by Queen Elizabeth during a visit on 9 March 1995. Following this, it was renamed Armagh City and District Council from 1 October 1995. Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council presently holds the status on behalf of the city as there is no localised council body since the aforementioned districts were merged in 2015 as a result of local government reform. Armagh contains the lowest population of all the cities of Northern Ireland, and is sixth physically smallest in the UK. Its urban area covering , makes it the smallest city by size in Northern Ireland, however several other cities are smaller when the UK is taken as a whole.

==Notable buildings==
Armagh is the site of two cathedrals, both on hills and both named after Saint Patrick. The Church of Ireland cathedral dates back to around 445. The present-day, post-Reformation, Roman Catholic cathedral was constructed during the latter half of the 19th century and features twin spires, making it the tallest such structure in the county. Armagh is one of the few cities in the world that is home to two cathedrals of the same name.

Armagh has a Georgian area of heritage importance. Perhaps one of the more well known of the buildings is the former women&#x27;s prison. The construction of Armagh Gaol began in 1780 and was extended in the 1840s and 1850s. The front façade of the prison was built in the Georgian style, while the later development, based on the design of Pentonville (HM Prison), is Victorian. For most of its working life it was a women&#x27;s prison although not exclusively so. Armagh Gaol was the primary women&#x27;s prison in Northern Ireland. In 1986 the prison closed and its prisoners were transferred to the new prison at Maghaberry.

The city is home to the Armagh Observatory, founded in 1790, and to the Armagh Planetarium, established in 1968 to complement the research work of the Observatory. The palace of the Archbishop of Armagh is now the local council offices and, along with the archbishop&#x27;s private chapel, is open to the public. The Palace Stables heritage centre is a reconstructed stable block dating from the 18th century, which was once part of the Archbishop&#x27;s estate.

Among the city&#x27;s chief glories is Armagh Public Library on Abbey Street. It was founded in 1771 by Archbishop Richard Robinson (later created the first Baron Rokeby in 1777), using his own library as its nucleus. It is especially rich in 17th- and 18th-century books in English, including Dean Jonathan Swift&#x27;s own copy of the first edition of his &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; with his manuscript corrections.

Armagh Market House was built in 1815 as a two-storey five-bay building, and is currently used as a library.

Armagh County Museum is the oldest county museum in Ireland. The building dates from 1833 and was originally a school house. It was opened as the County Museum in 1937.

==Townlands==

Armagh is within the civil parish of Armagh. Like the rest of Ireland, this parish is divided into townlands, whose names mostly come from the Irish language. When these townlands were built upon, they lent their names to various streets, roads and housing estates. 
In 1830, most of Armagh&#x27;s urban townlands were amalgamated for administration and became known as Corporation Lands or simply Corporation. The surrounding townlands remained as separate units and they were eventually built upon too. They are listed below alongside their likely etymologies.

*Aghamoat ()
*Ballynahone More (from &quot;Baile na hAbhann&quot;, &quot;townland of the river&quot;)
*Cargagh (from &quot;Cairgeach&quot;, &quot;rocky land&quot;)
*Cavanacaw (from &quot;Cabhán an Chatha&quot;, &quot;hollow of the battle&quot; or &quot;Cabhán na Cáithe&quot;, &quot;hollow of the chaff&quot;)
*Drumadd (formerly Drumadokeenan, from &quot;Dromad Uí Chianáin&quot;, &quot;O&#x27;Keenan&#x27;s ridge&quot;)
*Drumarg (from &quot;Droim Mairge&quot;, &quot;ridge of the boundary&quot;)
*Drumman More (from &quot;Dromann&quot;, &quot;the ridge&quot;)
*Killuney (from &quot;Cill Liamhna&quot;, &quot;Liamhain&#x27;s church&quot;)
*Legarhill or Mullaghcreevie (from &quot;Mullach Craoibhe&quot;, &quot;hilltop of the branch&quot;; &quot;legar&quot; is from an old English word for a military camp)
*Longstone (named after a standing stone)

Armagh is part of the Newry and Armagh Assembly constituency.

Together with part of the district of Newry and Mourne, it forms the Newry &amp; Armagh constituency for elections to the Westminster Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly.

==Administration==
The Education Authority (Southern) and the Southern Health and Social Care Trust have their headquarters in the city, which has a long reputation as an administrative centre.

The secretariat of the North/South Ministerial Council is based in Armagh, and consists jointly of members of the civil services of both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

==Transport==
The Ulster Railway linked Armagh with Belfast in 1848 and Monaghan in 1858. The Newry and Armagh Railway (N&amp;A) opened in 1864 and the Castleblayney, Keady and Armagh Railway (CK&amp;A) was completed in 1910. In 1876 the Ulster Railway became part of the new Great Northern Railway (GNR), which took over the N&amp;A in 1879 and the CK&amp;A in 1911.

The Armagh rail disaster, which killed 80 people, occurred on 12 June 1889 on the N&amp;A line near Armagh.

The partition of Ireland in 1922 hastened the railways&#x27; decline, and the GNR closed the Keady – Castleblayney section of the CKA in 1923. The GNR withdrew passenger trains from the Armagh – Keady section of the CKA in 1922 and closed the Armagh – Markethill section of the N&amp;A in 1933. The Government of Northern Ireland forced the GNR Board to close all remaining lines serving Armagh railway station on 1 October 1957: the goods branch from Armagh to Keady and the main line through Armagh from as far as the border at Glaslough on the way to Monaghan.

Today Armagh is the only city in Ireland that is not served by rail, however Portadown is the nearest station. NI Railways train services run from Portadown to Belfast Grand Central and the cross-border Enterprise service runs via Newry to Dublin Connolly. Poyntzpass also has a limited service.

When he was Minister for the Department for Regional Development, then MLA Danny Kennedy had indicated plans to restore the railway from Armagh station to Portadown.

==Sport==

Armagh City Football Club, which plays in the NIFL Championship is the main association football club, and the City of Armagh Rugby Club is the local rugby club. Lisanally Rangers F.C. is another football team, playing in the Mid-Ulster Football League.

Gaelic football is represented by Armagh Harps and Pearse Ógs. The local GAA handball club is Eugene Quinn&#x27;s, named after a player from the Armagh area who died on an attempted swim from Tory Island to mainland County Donegal. The local hurling club is Armagh Cúchulainns.

In 2004, the Royal School, Armagh became only the second team in history to win both the schools&#x27; rugby and hockey cups in the same year.

The Mall in Armagh has a long association with cricket, and is the location of the Armagh Cricket Club clubhouse.

<text>The A19 is a major road in England running approximately parallel to and east of the A1 road. Although the two roads meet at the northern end of the A19, the two roads originally met at the southern end of the A19 in Doncaster, but the old route of the A1 was changed to the A638. From Sunderland northwards, the route was formerly the A108. In the past the route was known as the East of Snaith-York-Thirsk-Stockton-on-Tees-Sunderland Trunk Road. Most traffic joins the A19, heading for Teesside, from the A168 at Dishforth Interchange.

== Route ==
=== Doncaster–Selby ===
The southern end of the A19 starts at the St Mary&#x27;s Roundabout with the A630 and A638 just to the north of Doncaster itself near to the parish church. It leaves the A638 at the next roundabout as &quot;Bentley Road&quot;, and then winds its way over the East Coast Main Line, which it follows through Selby and York, through the suburb of Bentley.

Much of the course of the southern section of the A19 runs through the old Yorkshire coalfield. It meets the B1220 for Carcroft and goes through Owston. The surrounds are mostly flat as the road heads towards the M62. It enters North Yorkshire and the district of Selby where it crosses the River Went near Walden Stubbs. It meets the M62 at junction 34.

From the M62, the village of Eggborough has been bypassed in recent years, with the new road travelling from this roundabout to near the site of Eggborough Power Station. Close by is Whitley Bridge and the A19 then meets the A645 at a roundabout and its previous alignment to the north of the village, before travelling through Chapel Haddlesey where it crosses the River Aire and the small village of Burn.

=== Selby–Thirsk ===
The £5 million Riccall and Barlby bypass opened in October 1987. This improved junctions with the A63 (Howden) and A163 (Holme-on-Spalding-Moor). The A63 and A19 meet at a roundabout near a large pickle factory. The A19 heads towards Riccall, following what was the East Coast Main Line before the Selby Diversion was built. Where the road leaves the old railway, the Trans Pennine Trail follows along the old track. At Escrick, the road enters the Vale of York, and passes the BP &quot;York Road Garage&quot;, the Parsonage Hotel and St Helen&#x27;s Church. Next is Deighton, passing the &quot;White Swan Inn&quot;, then it heads towards Crockey Hill. It meets the A64 near the headquarters of Persimmon plc.

The York Northern By-Pass (A1237) is a substitute for the A19 through York. There road makes a left turn for Tollerton and goes through Tollerton Forest. Heading northward, the section between York and Thirsk was not helped much by the opening of the £5 million Easingwold Bypass in November 1994, as the road remained single carriageway, starting at a roundabout. There is a left turn for Raskelf. It meets the A168 from the south, and the old route through Thirsk is now the A170, then the A61. The bypass meets the A61 and A168 (for Northallerton) at a junction near South Kilvington.

=== Thirsk–Billingham ===

North of Thirsk, the A19 takes over from the A168 as the link from the A1 to Teesside and becomes a fast dual carriageway with mostly grade separated interchanges. The five-mile £4.4 million Thirsk bypass was opened on 5 September 1972 by Robin Turton, Baron Tranmire, the local MP (from 1929), with a flypast by four Royal Air Force Vickers Varsity aircraft – RAF Topcliffe is to the south-west of Thirsk. It passes North Kilvington, and the £0.3 million South of Knayton (at Swan Lane) to north of Thirsk bypass section opened in the early 1970s. It climbs slightly past the junction at Knayton near Borrowby and skirting the western edge of the North York Moors, meeting the A684 (for Northallerton) at Clack Lane End after passing through Leake and by the &quot;Haynes Arms&quot;. The Borrowby diversion opened in the late 1960s. The £1.1 million south of Clack Lane End to north end of Borrowby diversion opened in the early 1970s, built by A.F. Budge. The Cleveland Tontine to Clack Lane End improvement opened in the early 1970s. It drops towards the Cleveland Tontine at the junction with the A172 (for Stokesley and Guisborough). later, it passes the BP &quot;Exelby Services&quot; on both sides of the road. Eventually after passing the Crathorne/Yarm exit the road passes over the Leven viaduct towards Teesside. From the Crathorne bypass, the road leaves the old route to the east, with the old route now being the A67 then the A135 through Stockton. About from the Parkway Turn (A174) in Middlesbrough the road is raised slightly, overlooking Thornaby industrial estate and the town of Ingleby Barwick, giving clues that Teesside is imminent.

=== Billingham–Seaton Burn ===
Past Teesside the A19 enters rural landscape, meeting the former route through Billingham, where it enters the borough of Hartlepool. There is a right turn for Dalton Piercy at the Windmill Motel, and two link roads into Elwick, to the east. At Sheraton with Hulam, there is an intersection for the B1280 (for Wingate to the west), and the A179 (for Hartlepool, to the east). At this intersection the road enters County Durham. The route over Sedgewick Hill has been improved to the east. There is staggered crossroads, for Hutton Henry, to the left. There used to be a right turn for Castle Eden, now accessible only from the southbound carriageway. North of here, the Castle Eden Diversion opened in the early 1970s. It crosses a former railway (now NCN 1 and 14), and meets the A181 (for Wheatley Hill and Durham), and the B1281 (for Hesleden) at an intersection, and passes west of Shotton, where it joins the former route. There is a large intersection at &quot;Burnhope Way Roundabout&quot; for Shotton Colliery and a large industrial estate, to the west, and the B1320 for the new town of Peterlee, to the east.
A flyover was constructed in the early 1990s to replace the previous roundabout, known locally as the Turnpike.

The 3.5-mile Easington and Cold Hesledon Diversion opened in the early 1970s, initially designated as the A19(M). There is an access road to the south from Easington and the A1086 (for Peterlee and Hartlepool) has limited access to the northbound and from the southbound routes. There is an intersection for the A182 (for Hetton-le-Hole), and limited access from the B1283 (for Easington Village), with no access from the southbound route. The former route north of Easington is the B1432 (to the east). At Cold Hesledon, there is an intersection for the A182 (to Seaham, to the east) and the B1285 (for Murton, to the west). The three-mile New Seaham and Seaton Diversion opened in the early 1970s, with the former route now the B1285 through Dalton-le-Dale. The eight miles of sections from Easington to Seaham were built by A. R. Carmichael in late 1971, and made the A19 from Thirsk to Sunderland completely dual-carriageway, with the contract awarded in October 1969. At Seaton with Slingley, there is a limited-access (to and from the south) intersection for the A1018, for Sunderland and Ryhope. At the same point there is a limited-access intersection (to and from the north) for the B1404 for Seaton and Houghton-le-Spring. The former route through the south of Sunderland is now the B1522. At the point where a former railway crosses (now NCN Route 1) the road enters the City of Sunderland.

At this point, the A19 makes a large deviation from its former route, by bypassing Sunderland from the west. Its former route went near the coast. The 8.75-mile Sunderland Bypass opened as the A108, and was built by W.C. French, with fourteen bridges and five underpasses, with the contract awarded in February 1970. The A108 was also previously the number of an A road in north London, for a re-routed A10 to Hoddesdon. At Herrington the A19 meets the A690 (for Houghton-le-Spring) and the B1286 at an interchange. It is crossed by the B1286. At Offerton and Hastings Hill there is an interchange with the A183 road (for Penshaw and Pennywell). The road crosses the River Wear on the Hylton Bridge, which was built as the A108 in 1975 by W.C. French (Construction) Ltd. At North Hylton, there is an interchange with the A1231 (for Washington and Castletown).
At Testo&#x27;s Roundabout with the A184 (for Gateshead and The Boldons), the A19 originally ended as the A1 took over to run through the Tyne Tunnel, before that classification became assigned to the Newcastle Western Bypass from the Angel of the North to Kingston Park. To the east the A19 now approaches the Tyne Tunnel, where a second tunnel opened in 2011 to relieve traffic congestion. There is a limited access junction (from the north) for Hedworth, and the road is crossed by the Green Line of the Tyne and Wear Metro. It meets the A194 (for South Shields) at an interchange. At the Jarrow Interchange, there is a roundabout for the A185 (for Hebburn) and the B1297 at the start of the single-carriageway £13 million Tyne Tunnel, opened in October 1967 as the A108.

The A19 continues in a north-westerly direction through North Tyneside past Killingworth and Cramlington, rejoining the current A1, just north of Newcastle at Seaton Burn.

==Distinctions==
In 2024, the A19 topped a survey of road users by Transport Focus, with an 85% satisfaction rating, up from 6th place with 77% in 2023.

== Incidents ==
In November 1986 a tanker loaded with toluene overturned and caught fire near Brookfield. The driver and the occupants of three cars were injured. The fire burned for eight hours and led to residents being warned by Cleveland Police of potentially toxic fumes. The fire service later criticised the police response as a &quot;massive overreaction&quot;.

In 1988 a stretch of the road in Teesside was notoriously accident prone. In a now famous interview, then local councillor Mr Davidson appeared on TV to declare the road safe. During the interview, a crash took place directly behind him. 

In June 2008 a fuel tanker began leaking oil from its engine covering a mile-long stretch, including a bend, before stopping near Hartlepool. A small fire broke out and cars began sliding, although none crashed. The fire service shut down the road to clean it.

They married two months after the birth of their daughter, Tiffany, in 1993. Donald and Marla separated in 1997 and divorced in 1999.

==Early life and education==

Maples was born on October 27, 1963, in Cohutta, Georgia. Her mother, Ann Locklear Maples, was a homemaker and model, and her father, Stanley Edward Maples, a real estate developer, county commissioner, singer, and songwriter. She has one half-sister from her father&#x27;s previous marriage.

Maples attended Northwest Whitfield High School in Tunnel Hill, Georgia, where she played basketball, served as class secretary and was crowned the 1980–1981 homecoming queen during her senior year (she returned for the 1991 homecoming to crown the school&#x27;s new queen).

After graduating from high school in 1981, Maples competed in beauty contests and pageants. In 1983, she won the Miss Resaca Beach Poster Girl Contest, in 1984 she was the runner-up to Miss Georgia USA, and in 1985 she won the Miss Hawaiian Tropic.

Maples&#x27; album &quot;The Endless&quot;, released in August 2013, is a musical journey of spiritual awakening and transformational energy, featuring thought leaders such as the Dalai Lama, Michael Beckwith, and Deepak Chopra. In December 2012, Maples won a &quot;Hollywood Music in Media Award&quot; for best New Age/Ambient song, for &quot;House of Love&quot;, from that album.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===

Maples&#x27; relationship with Donald Trump was initiated while he was married to his first wife, Ivana, whom Trump divorced in 1990. Maples met him in 1984 and had a highly publicized relationship later with at least one breakup. One &quot;New York Post&quot; headline reported that Maples said Trump gave her the &quot;best sex I&#x27;ve ever had.&quot; Maples and Trump had one child, daughter Tiffany Trump, born on October 13, 1993.

According to Maples, the 1993 Long Island Rail Road shooting, on December 7, caused Trump to reevaluate his life and propose to her. The couple married on December 20, 1993, at New York&#x27;s Plaza Hotel, in a ceremony reportedly attended by 1,000 guests including Rosie O&#x27;Donnell and O.J. Simpson.

In 1996, Trump fired his bodyguard Spencer Wagner after a police officer found Maples and the bodyguard together under a lifeguard stand on a deserted beach at 4:00a.m. Both Maples and Trump denied that she was having an affair, despite reports in the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; and other tabloids; the bodyguard himself told conflicting stories about the incident. Maples and Trump separated in May 1997 and divorced on June 8, 1999. Under the terms of their prenuptial agreement and divorce settlement, Maples is bound by a confidentiality agreement on their marriage.

===Health and wellness===

Maples is an advocate of health and wellness. Her daughter Tiffany Trump has described Maples making her healthy homemade chocolate in Trump Tower; meanwhile her father would sneak her downstairs to the candy store to buy her Almond Joys. Maples describes herself as a &quot;mostly-vegan&quot; who avoids dairy, eats organic, and chooses to be gluten free.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Maples used her social media platforms to promote treatments that have not been proven effective, such as vitamin C drips. She also joined Children&#x27;s Health Defense&#x27;s Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in touting various discredited conspiracy theories about the disease.

<text>The A92 is a major road that runs through Fife, Dundee, Angus, Aberdeenshire, and Aberdeen City in Scotland. From south to north, it runs from Dunfermline to Blackdog, just north of Aberdeen.

==History==
The A92&#x27;s original route in southern Fife is now numbered as the A921. It connects with the M90 junction 1 via Burntisland and Kirkcaldy and links into the Thornton bypass.

Plans were drawn up in the 1960s for a new East Fife regional dual carriageway road starting at the M90 at Masterton (Junction 2), which would have mirrored what is now the A921 and B9157 to the Mossgreen area, before heading north-eastward to Chapel Level, connecting up with the Thornton By-pass. The plans were held back until the early 1970s, and were held back further due to the Oil crisis. During the 1970s the Scottish Development Department commissioned a new traffic study which concluded that the A92 should follow the more northern route to provide a better link for Cowdenbeath and Lochgelly before connecting directly onto the Thornton Bypass, which was completed by early 1983.

The new section between Crossgates and Glenrothes began construction in 1980, and was built in four phases:

* Thornton By-pass: Opened on 16 August 1983 
* Halbeath - Cowdenbeath: Opened in September 1985
* Cowdenbeath - Lochgelly: Opened on 13 August 1987
* Lochgelly - Thornton: the final phase which opened on 16 July 1990

In early April 1998 the A92 was extended beyond the Crossgates junction to provide direct access with the M90 southbound, to ease congestion around the Halbeath interchange. The new section was built three months ahead of schedule, costing £8.4m.

=== Numbering ===
The A92 formerly continued north from Stonehaven through Aberdeen, and terminated at Fraserburgh. The section between Stonehaven and Aberdeen was renumbered A90 in 1994. Upon completion of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR) in 2018, the section between Stonehaven and Blackdog was once again numbered as A92. The section between Blackdog and Fraserburgh has now been renumbered A90 and A952.

The section of the A92 between Dundee and Aberdeen was formerly part of the Euroroute system, on route E120, a closed loop connecting Inverness, Aberdeen, Dundee and Perth.

==Route==
Starting at its junction with the M90 motorway near Dunfermline, it runs north east past Cowdenbeath, Lochgelly, Kirkcaldy, Glenrothes, Ladybank and Newport-on-Tay. The road is a dual carriageway from the M90 to Glenrothes town centre, changing to a single carriageway as it passes through the northern side of the town, before switching back to dual carriageway north of Glenrothes (until it meets the A912 towards Perth and the A914 towards St Andrews), it reverts to a single carriageway until a few miles short of the Tay Road Bridge at Dundee. The section through Fife is often described as the East Fife Regional Road.

Across the Tay Road Bridge, the A92 continues along the east coast past Monifieth, Carnoustie, Muirdrum, Arbroath, Montrose, Inverbervie and the Fowlsheugh Nature Reserve before reaching Stonehaven where the road once again becomes dual carriageway. From here, the A92 runs parallel with the A90 for around 2 miles. The road then continues past Stonehaven and Portlethen heading into and through the city of Aberdeen before terminating at Blackdog, where the road once again merges with the A90.

The 16-mile section of the road from Dundee to Arbroath was upgraded to dual carriageway standard in 2005 and significantly reduced the journey time between the two towns. Between Arbroath and Stonehaven the road is a single carriageway apart from a very short section of dual carriageway near Gourdon. The road returns to dual carriageway from Stonehaven heading north to Aberdeen, briefly returning to single carriageway at the Bridge of Dee, and then again returning to single carriageway between the Haudagain and Parkway roundabouts in Aberdeen. The remainder of the road from the Parkway roundabout to the termination point at Blackdog is dual carriageway.

== Changes ==
In 2024, work began to reduce the A92 within Arbroath to single-carraigeway as part a remodelling that will see a dedicated cycle path and additional green space added.

==Archaeological==
The A92 road traverses lands on which prehistorical archaeological sites are present. Examples of these features include Gourdon Hill and the Stone of Morphie, both situated slightly to the west of the A92 alignment.

<text>The Bear River Massacre was an attack by around 200 US soldiers that killed an estimated 250 to 400 children, women, and men at a Shoshone winter encampment on January 29, 1863. Some sources describe it as the largest mass murder of Native Americans by the US military, and largest single episode of genocide in US history. It took place in present-day Franklin County, Idaho near the present-day city of Preston on January 29, 1863. After years of skirmishes and food raids on farms and ranches, and colonial settlers displacing Shoshone from their ancestral lands, the United States Army attacked a large Shoshone community at the confluence of the Bear River and Battle Creek in what was then southeastern Washington Territory.

Colonel Patrick Edward Connor led a detachment of California Volunteers as part of the Bear River Expedition against Shoshone chief Bear Hunter. Around 250 to 400 Shoshone children and adults were killed near their homes, and 21 US soldiers died. The event is also known as the Engagement on the Bear River, the Battle of Bear River, and Massacre at Boa Ogoi.

== Early history and causes ==
Cache Valley, originally called &quot;Seuhubeogoi&quot; (Shoshone for &quot;Willow Valley&quot;), was the traditional hunting ground for the Northwestern Shoshone. They gathered grain and grass seeds there, fished for trout, and hunted small game such as ground squirrel and woodchuck, and large game including bison, deer, and elk. This mountain valley had attracted fur trappers such as Jim Bridger and Jedediah Smith, who visited the region. It was named Cache Valley for the trappers&#x27; practice of leaving stores of furs and goods (i.e., a &quot;cache&quot;) in the valley as a base for hunting in the surrounding mountain ranges.

So impressed were the trappers by the region that they recommended to Brigham Young that he consider the valley as a location for his settlement of Mormon pioneers. Instead, Young chose Salt Lake Valley, but Mormon settlers eventually moved to Cache Valley as well. As early as July 31, 1847, a 20-man delegation of Shoshone met with the Mormons to discuss their land claims in northern Utah. All of this was over the backdrop of the continent-spanning American Indian Wars and the White settlers&#x27; American imperialist views on Manifest destiny, and their resulting genocide of US Native Americans.

=== Immigrant pressures causing Shoshone starvation ===
The establishment of the California and Oregon Trails, as well as the founding of Salt Lake City in 1847, brought the Shoshone people into regular contact with white colonists moving westward. By 1856, European Americans had established their first permanent settlements and farms in Cache Valley, starting at Wellsville, Utah, and gradually moving northward.

Brigham Young declared the policy that Mormon settlers should establish friendly relations with the surrounding American Indian tribes. He encouraged their helping to &quot;feed them rather than fight them&quot;. Despite the policy, the settlers were consuming significant food resources and taking over areas that pushed the Shoshone increasingly into areas of marginal food production. David H. Burr, Surveyor General of the Territory of Utah, wrote in 1856 that the local Shoshone Indians reported that the Mormons used so much of the Cache Valley&#x27;s resources that the once abundant game no longer appeared. Foraging and hunting by settlers traveling on the western migration trails took additional food sources away from the Shoshone. As early as 1859, Jacob Forney, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Territory of Utah, recognized the impact of migrants, writing, &quot;The Indians...have become impoverished by the introduction of a white population&quot;. He recommended that an Indian Reservation be established in Cache Valley to protect essential resources for the Shoshone. His superiors at the United States Department of the Interior did not act on his proposal. Desperate and starving, the Shoshone attacked farms and cattle ranches, not just for revenge but for survival.

In the early spring of 1862, James Duane Doty, Utah&#x27;s Territorial Superintendent of Indian Affairs, spent four days in Cache Valley and reported: &quot;The Indians have been in great numbers, in a starving and destitute condition. No provisions having been made for them, either as to clothing or provisions by my predecessors... The Indians condition was such-with the prospect that they would rob mail stations to sustain life.&quot; Doty purchased supplies of food and slowly doled it out. He suggested furnishing the Shoshone with livestock to enable them to become herders instead of beggars.

On July 28, 1862, John White discovered gold on Grasshopper Creek in southwestern Montana mountains. Soon, miners created a migration and supply trail right through the middle of Cache Valley, between this mining camp and Salt Lake City. The latter was the nearest significant trading source of goods and food in the area.

== Outbreak of the Civil War ==
When the American Civil War began in 1861, President Abraham Lincoln was concerned that California, which had just recently become a state, would be cut off from the rest of the Union. He ordered several regiments to be raised from the population of California to help protect mail routes and the communications lines of the West. Neither Lincoln nor the U.S. War Department quite trusted the Mormons of the Utah Territory to remain loyal to the Union, despite their leader Young&#x27;s telegrams and assurances. The Utah War and Mountain Meadows massacre were still fresh in the minds of military planners. They worried that the Mormons&#x27; substantial militia might answer only to Young and not the federal government.

Col. Patrick Edward Connor was put in command of the 3rd California Volunteer Infantry Regiment and ordered to move his men to Utah, to protect the Overland Mail Route and keep peace in the region. Upon arriving in Utah, he established Camp Douglas (adjacent to the current location of the University of Utah) as the primary base of operations for his unit. It was within a few miles of the Mormon Temple construction site and downtown Great Salt Lake City.

== Warnings and conflicts with Cache Valley settlers ==
Several incidents in the summer and fall of 1862 led to the battle between Bear Hunter and Col. Connor. These incidents were related to broad struggles between indigenous peoples and European-American settlers over almost the entire United States west of the Mississippi River. The attention of most of the nation&#x27;s population was focused on the Civil War in the eastern states. Some historians have overlooked these incidents because they occurred near the ill-defined boundary of two different territories: those of Washington and Utah. While the incidents took place in proximity, the administrative centers dealing with them were more than apart, so it was difficult to integrate reports. For example, for years, residents and officials believed Franklin and the area of conflict was part of the Utah Territory. Residents of Franklin sent elected representatives to the Utah Territorial Legislature; they were part of the politics of Cache County, Utah, until 1872 when a surveying team determined the community was in Idaho territory.

=== Pugweenee ===
When a resident of Summit Creek (now Smithfield) found his horse missing, he accused a young Shoshone fishing in nearby Summit Creek of having stolen the animal. Robert Thornley, an English immigrant and first resident of Summit Creek, defended the young Indian and testified for him. Nonetheless, a jury of locals convicted him and hanged him for stealing the horse. Local history recorded the Shoshone&#x27;s name as &quot;Pugweenee&quot;. The young Indian man was the son of the local Shoshone chief. Within a few days, the Shoshone retaliated by killing a couple of young men of the Merrill family gathering wood in the nearby canyon.

=== Massacre near Fort Hall ===

During the summer of 1859, a settler company of about 19 people from Michigan was traveling on the Oregon Trail near Fort Hall when they were attacked at night by people they assumed were local Shoshone. Several members of the company were killed by gunfire. The survivors took refuge along the Portneuf River, where they hid among the bullrushes and willow trees. Three days later, Lieutenant Livingston of Fort Walla Walla, leading a company of dragoons, met the survivors. He investigated the incident and documented what he called the brutality of the attack. According to the &quot;Deseret News&quot; of September 21, 1859, a detachment of Lieutenant Livingston&#x27;s dragoons found five bodies at the scene of the massacre were mangled. A girl of only five years old had her ears cut off, her eyes gouged out, both legs amputated at the knees, and by all appearances, was made to walk on her stumps.

=== Reuben Van Ornum and the Battle of Providence ===


On September 9, 1860, Elijah Utter was leading migrants on the Oregon trail when they were attacked by a group of presumably Bannock and Boise Shoshone. Despite settlers&#x27; attempts to appease the Native Americans, the Indians killed nearly the entire migrant party and drove off their livestock. Alexis Van Ornum, his family, and about ten others hid in some nearby brush, only to be discovered and killed. Their bodies were discovered by a company of U.S. soldiers led by Captain Frederick T. Dent. Lieutenant Marcus A. Reno came across the mutilated bodies of six of the Van Ornums. The survivors reported that the attacking warriors took four Van Ornum children captive. As a direct result of this attack, the Army established a military fort near the present location of Boise, Idaho, along the migrant trail. Colonel George Wright requested $150,000 to establish a military post to sustain five troop companies.

Zachias Van Ornum, Alexis&#x27; brother, heard from a relative on the Oregon Trail that a small white boy of his missing nephew Reuben&#x27;s age was being held by a group of Northwestern Shoshone, likely to be in Cache Valley. Van Ornum gathered a small group of friends and traveled to Salt Lake City to get help from the territorial government. There, he visited Col. Connor at Fort Douglas and asked for help to regain his nephew. Col. Connor agreed and sent a detachment of cavalry under the command of Major Edward McGarry to Cache Valley to rendezvous with Van Ornum near the town of Providence, Utah. Van Ornum located a small group of Shoshone warriors being led by Chief Bear Hunter. He and McGarry&#x27;s men followed the Shoshone as they retreated to nearby Providence Canyon. After the Indians opened fire, McGarry gave the order &quot;to commence firing and to kill every Indian they could see.&quot; A skirmish between the Shoshone and the U.S. Army lasted about two hours after the Shoshone established a defensible position in the canyon. Finally, Chief Bear Hunter signaled surrender by climbing a foothill and waving a flag of truce.

Together with about 20 of his people, Chief Bear Hunter was taken prisoner and transported to the soldiers&#x27; camp near Providence. When asked about the young white boy, Bear Hunter said that the boy had been sent away a few days earlier. McGarry instructed Bear Hunter to send his people to bring back the white boy. He held Bear Hunter and four warriors hostage. By noon the next day, the Shoshone returned with a small boy who fit the description of Reuben Van Ornum. Zachias Van Ornum claimed the boy was his nephew and took custody, departing to return to Oregon. The Shoshone protested, claiming that the boy was the son of a French fur trapper and the sister of Shoshone chief Washakie. After the federal troops left with Van Ornum and the young boy, McGarry reported to Col. Connor the boy&#x27;s rescue &quot;without the loss or scratch of man or horse.&quot; Bear Hunter complained to the settlers in Cache Valley, arguing they should have helped him against the soldiers. After a confrontation between Bear Hunter, some warriors from his band, and nearly 70 members of the Cache Valley militia, the settlers donated two cows and some flour as the &quot;best and cheapest policy&quot; as compensation.

=== Bear River crossing ===
On December 4, 1862, Connor sent McGarry on another expedition to Cache Valley to recover some stolen livestock from Shoshone. The Shoshone broke camp, fled in advance of the Army troops, and cut the ropes of a ferry at the crossing. McGarry got his men across the river but had to leave their horses behind. Four Shoshone warriors were captured and held for ransom, although they did not appear related to the theft. McGarry ordered that these men would be shot if the stock was not delivered by noon the next day. The Shoshone chiefs moved their people further north into Cache Valley. A firing squad executed the captives and dumped their bodies into the Bear River. In an editorial, the &quot;Deseret News&quot; expressed concern that the execution would aggravate relations with the Shoshone.

=== Incident on the Montana Trail ===
A.H. Conover, the operator of a Montana Trail freight-hauling service between mining camps of Montana and Salt Lake City, was attacked by Shoshone warriors who killed two men accompanying him: George Clayton and Henry Bean. Arriving in Salt Lake City, Conover told a reporter the Shoshone were &quot;determined to avenge the blood of their comrades&quot; killed by Major McGarry and his soldiers. He said the Shoshone intended to &quot;kill every white man they should meet on the north side of the Bear River, till they should be fully avenged.&quot;

=== Attack on the Montana Trail ===
The final catalyst for Connor&#x27;s expedition was a Shoshone attack on a group of eight miners on the Montana Trail. They had come within of the central Shoshone winter encampment north of Franklin. The miners missed a turn and ended up mired and lost on the western side of the Bear River, unable to cross the deep river. Three men swam across to Richmond, where they tried to get provisions and a guide from the settlers. Before they returned, the other five men were attacked by Shoshone, who killed John Henry Smith of Walla Walla and some horses. When the Richmond people returned with the advance party, they recovered the body of John Smith and buried him at the Richmond city cemetery.

The surviving miners reached Salt Lake City. William Bevins testified before Chief Justice John F. Kinney and swore an affidavit describing Smith&#x27;s murder. He also reported that ten miners en route to the city had been murdered three days before Smith. Kinney issued a warrant for the arrest of chiefs Bear Hunter, Sanpitch, and Sagwitch. He ordered the territorial marshal to seek assistance from Col. Connor for a military force to &quot;effect the arrest of the guilty Indians.&quot;

Due to such reports, Connor was ready to mount an expedition against the Shoshone. He reported to the U.S. War Department before the engagement:

I have the honor to report that from information received from various sources of the encampment of a large body of Indians on Bear River, in Utah Territory, 140 miles north of this point, who had settlements in this valley to the Beaver Head mines, east of the Rocky Mountains, and being satisfied that they were a part of the same band who had been murdering emigrants on the Overland Mail Route for the last fifteen years, and the principal actors and leaders in the horrid massacres of the past summer, I determined, although the season was unfavorable to an expedition in consequence of the cold weather and deep snow, to chastise them if possible.

== Military action in Cache Valley ==
In many ways, the soldiers stationed at Fort Douglas were spoiling for a fight. In addition to discipline problems among the soldiers, there was a minor &quot;mutiny&quot; among the soldiers where a joint petition by most of the California Volunteers requested to withhold over $30,000 from their paychecks for the sole purpose of instead paying for naval passage to the eastern states, and to &quot;serve their country in shooting traitors instead of eating rations and freezing to death around sage brush fires...&quot;. Furthermore, they said they would gladly pay this money &quot;for the &quot;privilege&quot; (original emphasis) of going to the Potomac and getting shot.&quot; The War Department declined this request.

Throughout most of January 1863, soldiers at Fort Douglas were preparing for a lengthy expedition traveling north to the Shoshone. Connor also wanted to keep the word of his expedition secret, making a surprise attack upon the Shoshone when he arrived. To do this, he separated his command into two detachments that were to come together from time to time on their journey to Cache Valley. His main concern was to avoid the problems that McGarry had faced in the earlier action, where the Shoshone had moved and scattered even before his troops could arrive.

Reaction to this military campaign was mixed. George A. Smith, in the official &quot;Journal History of the LDS Church&quot;, wrote:

It is said that Col. Connor is determined to exterminate the Indians who have been killing the Emigrants on the route to the Gold Mines in Washington Territory. Small detachments have been leaving for the North for several days. If the present expedition copies the doings of the other that preceded it, it will result in catching some friendly Indians, murdering them, and letting the guilty scamps remain undisturbed in their mountain haunts.

On the other hand, the &quot;Deseret News&quot; in an editorial, expressed:

...with ordinary good luck, the volunteers will &quot;wipe them out.&quot; ...We wish this community rid of all such parties, and if Col. Connor be successful in reaching that bastard class of humans who play with the lives of the peaceable and law-abiding citizens in this way, we shall be pleased to acknowledge our obligations. 

The first group to leave Fort Douglas was forty men of Company K, 3rd Regiment California Volunteer Infantry, commanded by Captain Samuel W. Hoyt, accompanied by 15 baggage wagons and two &quot;mountain howitzers&quot;, totaling 80 soldiers. They left on January 22, 1863.
The second group was 220 cavalry, led personally by Connor himself with his aides and 50 men each from Companies A, H, K, and M of the 2nd Regiment of Cavalry, California Volunteers, which left on January 25. As orders specific for this campaign, Connor ordered each soldier to carry &quot;40 rounds of rifle ammunition and 30 rounds of pistol ammunition&quot;. This was a total of nearly 16,000 rounds for the campaign. In addition, nearly 200 rounds of artillery shot were brought with the howitzers. As a part of the deception, the cavalry were to travel at night while the infantry moved during the day. Accompanying Connor was the former U.S. Marshal and Mormon scout, Orrin Porter Rockwell.

On the evening of January 28, Captain Hoyt&#x27;s infantry finally arrived near the town of Franklin, where they spotted three Shoshone who were attempting to get food supplies from the settlers in the town. The Shoshone received nine bushels of wheat in three sacks. William Hull, the settler who was assisting the Shoshone, noted later:

we had two of the three horses loaded, having put three bushels on each horse...when I looked up and saw the Soldiers approaching from the south. I said to the Indian boys, &quot;Here comes the &quot;Toquashes&quot; (Shoshone for U.S. Soldiers) maybe, you will all be killed. They answered &#x27;maybe the Toquashes will be killed too,&quot; but not waiting for the third horse to be loaded, they quickly jumped upon their horses and led the three horses away, disappearing in the distance.

The sacks of grain carried by these Shoshone were later found by the 3rd California Volunteers during their advance the next day, apparently dropped by the Shoshone in their attempt to get back to their camp.

Col. Connor met up with Hoyt that evening as well, with orders to begin moving at about 1:00 am the next morning for a surprise attack, but an attempt to get a local settler to act as a scout for the immediate area led the actual advance to wait until 3:00 am.

This military action occurred during perhaps the coldest time of the year in Cache Valley. Local settlers commented that it was unseasonably cold even for northern Utah, and it may have been as cold as −20 °F (−30 °C) on the morning of the 29th when the attack began. Several soldiers had come down with frostbite and other cold-weather problems, so the 3rd volunteers were at only about 2/3 of their strength compared to when they had left Fort Douglas. Among the rations issued to the soldiers during the campaign was a ration of whiskey held in a canteen; several soldiers noted that this whiskey froze solid on the night before the attack.

== Shoshone battle preparations ==
Most of the firearms that the Shoshone had at the time of the attack had been captured in minor skirmishes, traded from fur trappers, white settlers, and other Native American tribal groups, or simply antiques that had been handed down from one generation to another over the years. Their weapons were not as standardized or as well built as the guns issued by the Union Army to the soldiers of the California Volunteers.

Bear Hunter and the other Shoshone chiefs did, however, make some defensive arrangements around their encampment, in addition to simply selecting a generally defensible position in the first place. Willow branches had been woven into makeshift screens, hiding the position and numbers of Shoshone. They also dug a series of &quot;rifle pits&quot; along the eastern bank of Beaver Creek and the Bear River.

At the same time the arrest warrant was issued by Justice Kinney, Chief Sagwitch (named in the warrant) was in Salt Lake City trying to negotiate peace on behalf of the Northwestern Shoshone. A correspondent for the &quot;Sacramento Union&quot; reported, &quot;The Prophet (Brigham Young) had told Sagwitch the Mormon people had suffered enough from the Shoshoni of Cache Valley and that if more blood were spilled, the Mormons might just &quot;pitch in&quot; and help the troops.&quot;

While it appears as though the deception by Connor to hide the numbers of his soldiers involved in the confrontation was successful, the Shoshone were not even then anticipating a direct military engagement with these soldiers. Instead, they were preparing for a negotiated settlement where the chiefs would be able to talk with officers of the U.S. Army and try to come to an understanding.

== Massacre ==
Major McGarry and the first cavalry units of the 2nd Regiment California Volunteer Cavalry arrived at the massacre scene at 6:00 am, just as dawn broke over the mountains. Due to the weather conditions and deep snow, it took time for Connor to organize his soldiers into a battle line. The artillery never arrived as they got caught in a snow drift from the Shoshone encampment. Connor or his subordinate Major Edward McGarry was reported to have commanded &quot;Kill everything—nits make lice.&quot;

Chief Sagwitch noted the approach of the American soldiers, saying just before the first shots were fired, 
Look like there is something up on the ridge up there. Look like a cloud. Maybe it is a steam come from a horse. Maybe that&#x27;s them soldiers they were talking about.

Initially, Connor tried a direct frontal offensive against the Shoshone positions but was soon overwhelmed with return gunfire from the Shoshone. The California Volunteers suffered most of their direct combat-related casualties during this first assault.

After temporarily retreating and regrouping, Connor sent McGarry and several other smaller groups into flanking maneuvers to attack the village from the sides and behind. He directed a line of infantry to block any attempt by the Shoshone to flee from the attack. After about two hours, the Shoshone had run out of ammunition. According to some later reports, some Shoshone were seen trying to cast lead ammunition during the middle of the battle and died with the molds in their hands. Bear Hunter was killed, with some later reporting that he had been among those casting bullets; Madsen described the possibility as &quot;doubtful&quot;.

== Casualties and immediate aftermath ==
The California Volunteers suffered 14 soldiers killed and 49 wounded, 7 mortally. After the officers concluded the battle was over, they returned with the soldiers to their temporary encampment near Franklin. Franklin residents opened their homes to wounded soldiers that night. They brought blankets and hay to the church meetinghouse to protect the other soldiers from the cold. Connor hired several men to use sleighs to bring wounded men back to Salt Lake City.

Connor estimated his forces killed more than 224 out of 300 warriors. He reported capturing 175 horses and some arms, and destroying 70 lodges and a large quantity of stored wheat in winter supplies. He left a small quantity of wheat on the field for the 160 captured women and children.

The death toll was large, but some Shoshone survived. Many sources state that US soldiers raped Shoshone women during the attack. Chief Sagwitch gathered survivors to keep his community alive. Sagwitch was shot twice in the hand and tried to escape on horseback, only to have the horse shot out from under him. He went to the ravine and escaped into the Bear River near a hot spring, where he floated under some brush until nightfall. Sagwitch&#x27;s son, Beshup Timbimboo, was shot seven times but survived and was rescued by family members. Other band members hid in the willow brush of the Bear River or tried to act as if they were dead. Sagwitch and other survivors retrieved the wounded and built a fire to warm the survivors.

There was a large difference between the number of Indians reported killed by Connor and the number counted by the citizens of Franklin, the latter being much larger. The settlers also claimed the number of surviving women and children to be much fewer than what Connor claimed. In his 1911 autobiography, Danish immigrant Hans Jasperson claims to have walked among the bodies and counted 493 dead Shoshone.
In 1918, Sagwitch&#x27;s son &quot;Be-shup&quot;, Frank &quot;Timbimboo&quot; Warner, said, &quot;[H]alf of those present got away,&quot; and 156 were killed. He went on to say that two of his brothers and a sister-in-law &quot;lived&quot;, as well as many who later lived at the Washakie, Utah, settlement, the Fort Hall reservation, in the Wind River country, and elsewhere.

Based on a variety of sources, Brigham D. Madsen estimates about 250 were killed in the definitive history of the massacre.

== Effects on settlement of Cache Valley and long-term consequences ==

This conflict marked the final significant influence of the Shoshone nation upon Cache Valley and its immediate surroundings. In addition to opening the northern part of Cache Valley to Mormon settlement, the massacre opened Cache Valley as a staging area for additional settlements in southeastern Idaho. Friction between the Mormons and Col. Connor continued for many more years with accusations of harassment of non-Mormons in the Utah Territory and criticisms by Mormons of Connor&#x27;s attempts to begin a mining industry in Utah. The overall response
from local Mormon settlers was gratitude for eliminating the local Shoshone people, while a number expressed remorse for their suffering. Historian Madsen states that &quot;Tacitly, if not overtly, the Mormons were accomplices&quot; to the massacre.

Chief Sagwitch and many members of his band allied with the Mormons. Many were baptized and joined the LDS Church. Sagwitch was ordained as an Elder in the Melchizedek priesthood. Members of this band helped to establish the town of Washakie, Utah, named in honor of the Shoshone chief. Most of the remaining members of the Northwestern band of Shoshone built farms and homesteads under LDS Church sponsorship. Their descendants became largely integrated into mainstream LDS society. The Shoshone who were not involved with this settlement went to the Fort Hall Indian Reservation or the Wind River Indian Reservation.

According to published newspaper articles, Col. Connor and the California Volunteers were treated as heroes when they arrived at Fort Douglas and by their community in California. Connor was promoted to the permanent rank of brigadier general and given a brevet promotion shortly afterward to the rank of major general. Connor campaigned against Native Americans in the West for the remainder of the U.S. Civil War, leading the Powder River Expedition against the Sioux and Cheyenne.

== Memorials and legacy ==
The Bear River Massacre Site is located near U.S. Route 91. The site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1990. The Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation acquired the site in 2018 to protect it as a sacred burial ground. They intend to erect a monument in memory of the massacre&#x27;s victims.

The Smithsonian Institution repatriated two Shoshone human remains, that of a teenage man and a woman who was in her 20s when she was killed, back to the Shoshone people for burial. The remains were returned in 2013.

Little was known about the Bear River Massacre or the life and reputation of Patrick Edward Connor in his native County Kerry in Ireland. However, on Monday 7 August 2023 (August Bank Holiday Monday) local radio station, Radio Kerry, broadcast a 90-minute radio documentary entitled &quot;Gloryhunter, Kerry’s Indian Killer.&quot;

This documentary sets out a detailed account of the massacre and Connor’s role in the dispossession and killing of first nation Americans in modern day Utah, Idaho and Colorado. It features interviews with historians and authors, as well as representatives of the Shoshone nation. The full documentary is available to hear on Spotify.

<text>The A96 is a major road in the north of Scotland.

It runs generally west/north-west from Aberdeen, bypassing Blackburn, Kintore, Inverurie, Huntly, Fochabers and Forres, and running through Keith, Elgin and Nairn. The road terminates at the A9 outside Inverness.

== Route ==
The road begins at Mounthooly roundabout, just north of Aberdeen city centre. It then exits Aberdeen to the North West, meeting the A92 at the Haudagain Roundabout, a notoriously busy junction. It then passes Bucksburn, and has a junction with Aberdeen Airport. The road is then dual carriageway until Inverurie, where it becomes single carriageway. The route then connects up Huntly, Keith, Fochabers, Elgin, Forres &amp; Nairn before terminating on the A9 at Inverness.

== History ==

The A96 has been improved with the addition of bypasses in the 1980s/1990s for Auldearn, Forres, Lhanbryde, Huntly &amp; Inverurie. The road has been dualled between Inverurie &amp; Aberdeen and several short overtaking lanes exist on the route. There are also short stretches of the route that have been widened and realigned to improve traffic flow and overtaking opportunities.

Debate about a new section of road to bypass Fochabers took place for a number of years. When the new bridge was built over the River Spey (in about 1970), it was built to be in line with a possible northern route. The bypass is to the north of Fochabers and south of Mosstodloch, construction started on 2 February 2010 and was opened in January 2012. The road still passes through many major towns on the route, namely Elgin, Nairn and Keith.

The A96 has a poor safety record in the substantial single carriageway section, and the road has topped polls to find the most unpopular roads in Scotland on more than one occasion. 

The A96 was formerly part of the Euroroute system, of route E120 which ran in a circular route between Inverness, Aberdeen, Dundee and Perth.

==Upgrades==

===Inveramsay Bridge===
A new bridge called the Inveramsay Bridge was constructed on the A96 northwest of Inverurie. This bridge goes over the Aberdeen-Inverness railway line instead of under it like the former one. The former bridge was not wide enough for two tall vehicles to fit under it so traffic lights were put in place, but caused serious congestion during peak hours.

===A96 dualling===
In 2016, the Scottish Government announced plans to upgrade the A96 road to a dual carriageway by 2030, at a cost of £3 billion. The project would include dualling the of the A96 that is not dual carriageway between Aberdeen and Inverness.

An section of the A96 between Inverness and Auldearn that will bypass Nairn will be the first section of the A96 to be dualled.

=== Environmental impact ===
Plans to dual the A9 and A96 have been criticised by Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens, who has said the plans are incompatible with the Scottish Government&#x27;s climate initiatives. Concerns have also been raised over the loss of ancient woodland.

=== Cycle paths ===
A cycle path has been built between Kintore and Port Elphinstone. In October 2021, work began to build a shared cycle and footpath along the road between Lhanbryde and Fochabers.

<text>The A39 is an A road in south west England. It runs south-west from Bath in Somerset through Wells, Glastonbury, Street and Bridgwater. It then follows the north coast of Somerset, Devon and Cornwall through Williton, Minehead, Porlock, Lynmouth, Barnstaple, Bideford, Stratton, Camelford, Wadebridge and St Columb Major. It then joins the route of the A30 road for around , re-emerging near Zelah to head for the south Cornish coast via Truro and Falmouth.

In Cornwall and North Devon (until the junction with the A361 &quot;North Devon Link Road&quot;), the road is known as the Atlantic Highway, and was classified as a trunk road until 2002.

==Porlock Hill==
Porlock Hill is a section of the A39 west of the village of Porlock. The road climbs approximately in less than up onto Exmoor: a very steep hill with gradients of up to 1 in 4 and hairpin bends.

In Porlock itself you will often smell burning brakes from vehicles who have just descended the hill.

On 12 January 1899, the ten-ton Lynmouth lifeboat was launched during a storm, but the storm&#x27;s ferocity meant it could not put out to sea. Instead, it was retrieved and hauled by men and twenty horses over Countisbury and Porlock hills to Porlock Weir where the water in the bay was less rough. The endeavour eventually enabled thirteen seamen to be rescued.

There is a less steep toll road that small vehicles and cyclists can take as an alternative route. It formed part of the route in the 2007 Tour of Britain cycle race. Another alternative for cyclists, avoiding tolls, is provided by part of Regional Cycle Route 51 (Minehead to Ilfracombe).

==Countisbury Hill==
About to the west of Porlock Hill, the A39 starts its equivalent descent from the hills of Exmoor. Within about , the road descends the it had previously climbed. Unlike Porlock Hill, this section is relatively straight down into Lynmouth village where there is a bridge over the river and a sharp left turn, however the gradient at the foot is also 25% for a short distance. The original road between Lynmouth and Lynton was much more challenging with gradients of around 1 in 3 (33%). It is now the B3234, Lynmouth Hill.

==Woody Bay==
At Martinhoe Cross in Devon—about west of Lynton and east of Parracombe—on the north side of the A39 lies a once disused but, in 2004, restored and reopened railway station. Woody Bay was once an intermediate stop on, and is now the main operating centre of, the Lynton &amp; Barnstaple Railway a narrow-gauge line built in 1898, which closed in 1935. Over- and under-bridges and other traces of the line can be seen at various locations along this stretch of the road.

==Atlantic Highway==
Atlantic Highway is the name given to a section of the A39, as it passes from the North Devon Link Road at Barnstaple in Devon until it reaches the A30 at Fraddon in Cornwall.

It is so called, as it is the main road (it was a trunk road until 2002) from mid-Cornwall to North Devon and follows the line of the Atlantic Ocean&#x27;s coast. It is also named thus due to the former Southern Railway express that ran in this part of North Devon and North Cornwall (the Atlantic Coast Express). Views of the Atlantic can be seen along its length, although the road does not approach very close to the coastline itself.

The road is signified as the Atlantic Highway by road signs indicating the route mileage throughout its length, in both directions, in white on brown above the green background of the route mileage boards.

It passes by Wadebridge, Bude and Bideford, and directly through Camelford.

<doc id="473821" wikidata="Q606825" url="?curid=473821" title="Newry and Mourne District Council">
<text>Newry and Mourne District Council () was a local council in Northern Ireland. It merged with Down District Council in May 2015 under local government reorganisation in Northern Ireland to become Newry, Mourne and Down District Council.

It included much of the south of County Armagh and the south of County Down and had a population of over 99,000. Council headquarters were in Newry, the largest settlement and only city in the area; it has a population of 28,850. Other towns in the council area included Crossmaglen and Bessbrook in County Armagh and Warrenpoint, Rostrevor, Hilltown, Annalong and Kilkeel (an important fishing port) in Down.

The council was formed in 1973 under the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972. Its area was formed from Kilkeel, Newry and Warrenpoint Urban Districts and Kilkeel and Newry No. 1 rural districts in County Down, and from Newry No. 2 Rural District in County Armagh. From 1973 to 1985, the council area consisted of six electoral areas. In 1985, this was reduced to five electoral areas: Crotlieve, Fews, Newry Town, Slieve Gullion and The Mournes. One of its 30 wards, Rathfriland, was transferred to Banbridge Council in 1993. At the elections of 2005, 30 members were elected from the following political parties: 14 Sinn Féin, 9 Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), 3 Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), 1 Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), 2 Independents and 1 UK Independence Party (UKIP).

==2014 criticism==
In April 2014 the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland criticised Newry and Mourne District Council for retaining the name of a children&#x27;s play park called after the IRA hunger striker, Raymond McCreesh. McCreesh had been arrested with a weapon used in the infamous Kingsmill massacre of Protestant workmen. Twenty nationalist councillors – including six (non-republican) SDLP representatives – voted to uphold his name in the December 2012 vote, but unionists campaigned against the decision. The Equality Commission concluded that their investigation has found that little consideration appears to have been given by the council to the impact its decision, in this instance, might have on Ulster Protestants/unionists or to the damage it might cause to good relations

==Review of Public Administration==
Under the Review of Public Administration (RPA) the council was due to merge with Down District Council in 2011 to form a single council for the enlarged area totalling 1539 km2 and a population of 150,886. The next election was due to take place in May 2009, but on 25 April 2008, Shaun Woodward, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland announced that the scheduled 2009 district council elections were to be postponed until the introduction of the eleven new councils in 2011. The merger ultimately took place in April 2015 to form Newry City, Mourne and Down District Council.

==Population==
The area covered by Newry and Mourne District Council had a population of 99,480 residents according to the 2011 Northern Ireland census.

<doc id="473822" wikidata="Q3930679" url="?curid=473822" title="Raymond Dalmau">
<text>Raymond Dalmau Pérez (born October 27, 1948) is a retired Puerto Rican professional basketball player and coach. Dalmau played in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN), the top tier basketball league in the country, for 20 seasons with the Piratas de Quebradillas. At the time of his retirement, at the end of the 1985 season, Dalmau was the BSN&#x27;s all-time leader in points (11,592), rebounds (5,673) and assists (2,302).

== Career ==
Dalmau grew up in Harlem, New York. From there he came to Puerto Rico for the first time in 1966, recruited by Raymond Burgos to reinforce the Piratas de Quebradillas in the BSN. At that time, players of Puerto Rican descent were recognized as imported into the tournament.

Dalmau had a very immediate impact in the league despite being only 17 years old. In his rookie year he finished second in scoring with an average of 18.4 points and 8.3 rebounds.

In 1968, Dalmau lead the league in scoring. He repeated as scoring champion in 1970, when he won his first championship as a member of the Piratas de Quebradillas. Dalmau, along with other &#x27;Nuyoricans&#x27; such as Neftalí Rivera and Néstor Cora in the Piratas team, dominated in the BSN league in the 1970s, reaching the BSN finals eight times and winning the championship on four occasions including back to back to back titles in 1977, 1978 and 1979. He won the BSN Most Valuable Player award three times.

He was in conversations in 1975 to sign a contract with the former Utah Stars in the ABA (American basketball association) but he declined to maintain his amateur status. Professional basketball players were not allowed at that time to play for their countries in international competition.

In 1982, Dalmau and Quebradillas returned to the BSN finals, but they lost to Mario Morales and the Guaynabo Mets in six games.

Dalmau participated in three Summer Olympics. He held the record for the most career points scored in the BSN league when he retired after scoring over 11,000 points in his career. He currently is in fifth place in the all-time scoring list and fourth in the all-time rebounding list of the BSN league.

Throughout his career, he was known not only for his abilities on the court, but also for his competitive spirit, which led him to do his best even when paired against taller and stronger rivals in international competitions.

== Retirement and coaching years ==
In 1985, Dalmau retired from basketball as a player, going on to coaching in the BSN for many years. He has also coached in Venezuela for a number of years.

He had success as coach for the Puerto Rico national basketball team. He won gold in the 1989 Tournament of the Americas and a fourth place in the 1990 FIBA World Championship.

== Personal life ==
Dalmau is married to Sandra Ortiz. They have three sons Christian, Richie, and Ricardo, and one daughter, Natalia. All three sons were basketball players in the BSN and also were part of the Puerto Rico national team.

In 1993, Dalmau was diagnosed with colon cancer, from which he recuperated. During a 2005 television show where he and Eddie Miró were being introduced as spokesmen in Puerto Rico for colon cancer, he quipped that, at his age, he can still jog everyday from Santurce to past the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in Isla Verde, which constitutes a considerable distance (more than five miles). On June 16, 2008, a project was approved by the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, in which Dalmau&#x27;s name was going to be used for a coliseum being built in Quebradillas.

==In popular culture==
In the 1996 film Basquiat, Benicio del Toro made a homage to Dalmau by wearing a replica of his Puerto Rico men&#x27;s national basketball team uniform with his distinctive number (14) fourteen. According to the IMDB, his character Benny&#x27;s last name is Dalmau.

Dalmau will appear in the forthcoming feature-length documentary film Nuyorican Básquet about Puerto Rico&#x27;s Men Basketball Squad of the 1979 Pan American Games.

<doc id="473823" wikidata="Q605802" url="?curid=473823" title="Landsat 7">
<text>Landsat 7 is the seventh satellite of the Landsat program. Launched on 15 April 1999, Landsat 7&#x27;s primary goal is to refresh the global archive of satellite photos, providing up-to-date and cloud-free images. The Landsat program is managed and operated by the United States Geological Survey, and data from Landsat 7 is collected and distributed by the USGS. The NASA WorldWind project allows 3D images from Landsat 7 and other sources to be freely navigated and viewed from any angle. The satellite&#x27;s companion, Earth Observing-1, trailed by one minute and followed the same orbital characteristics, but in 2011 its fuel was depleted and EO-1&#x27;s orbit began to degrade. Landsat 7 was built by Lockheed Martin Space Systems.

In 2016, NASA announced it planned to attempt the first ever refueling of a live satellite by refueling Landsat 7 in 2020 with the [[OSAM-1]] mission; however after multiple delays, NASA announced the cancellation of OSAM-1 in March 2024.

== Satellite specifications ==
Landsat 7 was designed to last for five years, and has the capacity to collect and transmit up to 532 images per day. It is in a polar, Sun-synchronous orbit, meaning it scans across the entire Earth&#x27;s surface. With an altitude of 705 km, it takes 232 orbits, or 16 days, to do so. The satellite weighs 1973 kg, is 4.04 m long, and 2.74 m in diameter. Unlike its predecessors, Landsat 7 has a solid-state memory of 378 Gbits (roughly 100 images). The main instrument on board Landsat 7 is the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), a whisk broom scanner image sensor.

== Instruments ==
* A panchromatic band with 15 metre spatial resolution (band 8)
* Visible (reflected light) bands in the spectrum of blue, green, red, near-infrared (NIR), and mid-infrared (MIR) with 30 metre spatial resolution (bands 1–5, 7)
* A thermal infrared channel with 60 metre spatial resolution (band 6)
* Full aperture, 5% absolute radiometric calibration

== Scan Line Corrector failure ==
On 31 May 2003, the Scan Line Corrector (SLC) in the ETM+ instrument failed. The SLC consists of a pair of small mirrors that rotate about an axis in tandem with the motion of the main ETM+ scan mirror. The purpose of the SLC is to compensate for the forward motion (along-track) of the spacecraft so that the resulting scans are aligned parallel to each other. Without the effects of the SLC, the instrument images the Earth in a &quot;zig-zag&quot; fashion, resulting in some areas that are imaged twice and others that are not imaged at all. The net effect is that approximately 22% of the data in a Landsat 7 scene is missing when acquired without a functional SLC.

A month after the SLC failure, the USGS compiled an assessment of the degraded data produced with the failed SLC. The assessment included input from scientists from USGS, NASA, and the Landsat 7 science team, and concluded that the results were still usable for many scientific applications and that there were several potential approaches to compensate for the missing data.

== Satellite imagery ==
In August 1998, NASA contracted EarthSat to produce Landsat GeoCover (&quot;Geocover 2000&quot; in NASA WorldWind) — a positionally accurate orthorectified Landsat Thematic Mapper and Multispectral Scanner imagery covering the majority of the Earth&#x27;s land mass. The contract was part of the NASA Scientific Data Purchase which was administrated through NASA&#x27;s John C. Stennis Space Center. GeoCover was later enhanced to EarthSat NaturalVue, a simulated natural color Landsat 7 derived circa year 2000, orthorectified, mosaicked and color balanced digital image dataset. Other commercial simulated true color 15-metre global imagery products built from the NASA Landsat 7 imagery include TerraColor from Earthstar Geographics, TruEarth (found in Google Earth and Google Maps) from TerraMetrics, BrightEarth from ComputaMaps, simulated natural color from Atlogis and a product of i-cubed used in NASA WorldWind.

Large parts of the Earth surface displayed on web mapping services like Google Maps / Google Earth, MSN Maps or Yahoo! Maps are based on enhanced and color balanced Landsat 7 imagery.

== Orbit lowering ==
Landsat 7 required regular orbital maneuvers to ensure that the local mean time (LMT) data acquisitions were maintained. The final such maneuver took place on February 7, 2017. From that point forward, the satellite&#x27;s orbit began to slowly degrade (lower) such that by 2021 it had faded from the desired 10:00 AM LMT to about 9:15 AM.

With the September 27, 2021 launch of Landsat 9, Landsat 7 is to be decommissioned. Its orbit has degraded such that Landsat 9 can move into the 705-km ) &quot;standard&quot; orbit altitude, and take Landsat 7&#x27;s place in an orbit that allows data to be collected eight days out of phase with Landsat 8 (with two satellites in orbit, a Landsat scene is collected over every location on Earth every eight days). Landsat 7&#x27;s 9:15 AM LMT acquisition will preclude acquiring high-quality and heritage-continuing data.

On April 6, 2022, the science mission was suspended and the image sensor was placed into standby mode as the satellite&#x27;s orbit was lowered.

NASA is exploring the possibility of using NASA&#x27;s OSAM-1 robotic servicing mission to refuel Landsat 7, primarily to ensure successful decommissioning, but also to provide the possibility of turning the satellite into a transfer radiometer. This would allow it to act as a calibration instrument for Landsats 8 and 9, and perhaps even extend its scientific utility.

On May 5, 2022, imaging was once again resumed, to assess the utility of imagery collected at the new lower orbit and earlier equatorial crossing time.

<doc id="473830" wikidata="Q289752" url="?curid=473830" title="Chara (singer)">
<text>, better known by her stage name , is a Japanese singer, actress and video jockey. She debuted in 1991 with the single &quot;Heaven&quot;. She is known for her song &quot;Swallowtail Butterfly (Ai no Uta)&quot;, the theme song for the 1996 Shunji Iwai film &quot;Swallowtail Butterfly&quot; in which she starred, her 1997 hit single &quot;Yasashii Kimochi&quot;, and her collaboration with Judy and Mary vocalist Yuki, &quot;Ai no Hi Mittsu Orange&quot;. Chara later formed a band with Yuki, called Mean Machine.

==Early life==
Chara grew up in Kawaguchi, Saitama. She started learning the piano from age four, and starting composing songs in elementary school. In her first year of elementary school, she performed a song she had written, , at a school piano recital.

She originally received her nickname &quot;Chara&quot; in junior high school, after a teacher called her this. She was so well known by this name that even some of her friends did not know her real name. She continues to use this name as she believes it brings out her inner child. After finishing high school, Chara went to Tokyo to a vocational school, majoring in music and specialising in piano. However, she dropped out one year into her two-year degree.

From 1984 onward, she worked as a keyboardist in several different unsigned bands. During this time, she found part-time work as a roller-skating waitress. In 1988, to get a chance to sing her own compositions, she decided to become a band vocalist instead. Her first live performance was at the Shinjuku Ruido live house in 1990.

==Career==

===1991–1995: Early releases===
Chara sent a demo tape to Sony Music in 1990, which caught the attention of Masahiro Ohara and landed her a deal with Epic Records Japan She recorded her debut album in early 1991 in Tokyo and London, and debuted in September with a performance at the Shibuya Club Quattro and the release of her debut single &quot;Heaven&quot;. In October, Chara became a personality on the ANN music show Video Jam, and later in November released her debut album &quot;Sweet&quot;. The album was not very successful, only reaching No. 64 on Oricon&#x27;s album charts.

Chara&#x27;s career gained more momentum after her first tour, &quot;Chara Live &quot;Sweet&quot;&quot; in May 1992. She became a radio personality for the FM Yokohama, with her own radio show , and her second album, Soul Kiss, won the 1992 Japan Record Award for best rock/pop album from a new artist. The album reached No. 14 on the album charts.

In 1993, she starred in many different commercials (or had her songs featured in them), including commercials for Suntory, Shiseido, Marui and Snow Brand ice creams. Her single , the song used in the Shiseido campaign, was her first top 100 charting single, reaching No. 66. The resulting album, &quot;Violet Blue&quot;, debuted at No. 4 on the charts. Her 1994 album, &quot;Happy Toy&quot;, riding on the success of her first top 50 single , also debuting at No. 4.

In spring 1994, she filmed the Shunji Iwai film Picnic, in which she played a mental patient. The film would not be released for another two years. She starred aside Tadanobu Asano, whom she married in 1995. Chara took a short break from music, releasing &quot;Chara the Best Baby Baby Baby XXX&quot; and giving birth to her first child, a girl named .Sumire means violet.

===1996–2001: Mainstream success===
In February 1996, Chara began filming her second film for Iwai, titled &quot;Swallowtail Butterfly&quot;. She played , a slum prostitute with musical aspirations. Chara recorded the soundtrack for the movie, collaborating with Mr. Children music producer Takeshi Kobayashi to create a Beatles-esque sound. The music was released under the name &quot;Yen Town Band&quot;, the name of the band Glico forms in the film.

Before the movie&#x27;s release, the theme song &quot;Swallowtail Butterfly (Ai no Uta)&quot; was released, along with Chara&#x27;s first film with Iwai, Picnic, finding a proper cinema release. The film was a massive hit, propelling Chara to stardom. Both the concept album, &quot;Montage&quot;, and the theme song reached No. 1 on Oricon charts. Her performance awarded her a Japan Academy Prize for Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role nomination. The film won the &quot;Most Popular Film&quot; award.

Chara&#x27;s fame soared, as shown by her next album &quot;Junior Sweet&quot;. The main single from the album, &quot;Yasashii Kimochi&quot; (the Shiseido &#x27;Tessera J&#x27; CM song), was a big hit, selling over 520,000 copies and became her second biggest hit after &quot;Swallowtail Butterfly (Ai no Uta)&quot;. The album was certified by the RIAJ as selling over 1,000,000 copies.

Her 1999 album, &quot;Strange Fruits&quot;, saw some success, debuting at No. 3 and selling over 300,000 copies. Chara teamed up with Judy and Mary vocalist Yuki to release a special single called &quot;Ai no Hi Mittsu Orange&quot;. This song is Chara&#x27;s third biggest hit, selling over 230,000 copies.

In 2000, Chara released her second best-of collection, &quot;Caramel Milk: The Best of Chara&quot;, and 2001 released her 8th album, &quot;Madrigal&quot;. &quot;Madrigal&quot; featured two tracks co-written with American guitarist James Iha.

===2001–2005: Mean Machine===
In late 2001, Chara released music as the drummer of the twin-drum all-girl rock band, Mean Machine, alongside Yuki, &quot;Swallowtail&quot; actress Ayumi Ito, 1980s musician Mayumi Chiwaki and former funk/rock band Jagatara dancer Yukarie. The band was conceived in 1998, when Chiwaki mentioned to Chara that she thought it would be good to start up a girls&#x27; rock band. One of the tenets of the band was that all members would have to do something they&#x27;d never tried before, landing Chara on drums. The band first practiced in 1999, and continued to sporadically practice throughout 2000, despite different members&#x27; schedules.

In 2001, the band debuted with the song , which was written by Chara during her second pregnancy, inspired by the breathing sounds of the Lamaze technique. Soon after, the band released their debut album &quot;Cream&quot;.

In 2003, Chara released her 9th solo album, &quot;Yoake Mae&quot;, and in 2004 released an album of re-recordings of songs from her early albums, &quot;A Scenery Like Me&quot;. This heralded the end of Chara&#x27;s Sony contract. Chara self-released her music after this point, recording songs from her own home and self-producing her work. These recordings resulted in a limited 2,000 copy album, &quot;Something Blue&quot;, and a digital single (used as the theme song for the Japanese release of the movie &quot;March of the Penguins&quot;).

During this period, Chara created several bands. One, &quot;Cold Sugar&quot; was a collaboration with Arai Akino.

===2006–present ===

Chara re-debuted as a major label artist in 2006, with the release of the single &quot;Sekai&quot;. Her single &quot;Fantasy&quot; was a minor hit, reaching No. 13 on Oricon charts. It was written in collaboration with Seiji Kameda, producer for artists such as Do As Infinity and bassist for the band Tokyo Jihen. The following album, &quot;Union&quot;, also fared well. It reached the top 5 in Oricon&#x27;s album charts, and outsold her former two Sony released albums. On the back of Chara&#x27;s returned success, Sony released the compilation album, &quot;Sugar Hunter: The Best Love Songs of Chara&quot;.

Chara&#x27;s Universal singles have fared better on digital charts. &quot;Trophy&quot;, a single from Chara&#x27;s second Universal album &quot;Honey&quot;, did well digitally, despite the physical release only reaching No. 37.

After the end of her contract with Universal, Chara released a new mini-album, Utakata, in November 2011 under BounDEE Inc. (a subsidiary of Space Shower Networks, the owners of Space Shower TV). &quot;Utakata&quot; charted at 56th spot on the Oricon charts and lasted there for three weeks.

On December 14, 2011, Chara announced in a concert at Shibuya-AX her transfer to Ki/oon Records (now Ki/oon Music), an imprint of Sony Music Japan. She joined Ki/oon&#x27;s 20th anniversary concert tour, &quot;Ki/oon 20 Years and Days&quot;, in April 2012 at Liquidroom Ebisu, Tokyo. She released her first single through Ki/oon, &quot;Alterna Girlfriend&quot;, on June 6, 2012.

Chara collaborated with Basement Jaxx for the song &quot;Wherever You Go&quot; on the album &quot;Junto&quot; in 2014.

==Personal life==
In 1994, Chara married actor Tadanobu Asano. She met Asano on the set of the 1994 film &quot;Picnic&quot;, in which they were both starring actors. Chara gave birth to a daughter, , on July 4, 1995. Chara also had a son with Asano on December 19, 1998. The couple attended the 80th Academy Awards in Los Angeles in 2008, as the film &quot;Mongol&quot;, in which Asano starred, was nominated for the best foreign film category as the submission from Kazakhstan. On July 25, 2009, Chara announced her amicable divorce from Asano, after 14 years of marriage. Chara has two tattoos: a blue bird on her back, and a on her neck. Chara&#x27;s children feature in her music. Sumire features on the cover of her album &quot;Honey&quot;, which also has a track named after her.

<text>--&gt;
| notable_ideas = 
Francis Herbert Bradley (30 January 184618 September 1924) was a British idealist philosopher. His most important work was &quot;Appearance and Reality&quot; (1893).

==Life==
Bradley was born at Clapham, Surrey, England (now part of the Greater London area). He was the child of Charles Bradley, an evangelical Anglican preacher, and Emma Linton, Charles&#x27;s second wife. A. C. Bradley was his brother. Educated at Cheltenham College and Marlborough College, he read, as a teenager, some of Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;. In 1865, he entered University College, Oxford. In 1870, he was elected to a fellowship at Oxford&#x27;s Merton College where he remained until his death in 1924. Bradley is buried in Holywell Cemetery in Oxford.

During his life, Bradley was a respected philosopher and was granted honorary degrees many times. He was the first British philosopher to be awarded the Order of Merit. His fellowship at Merton College did not carry any teaching assignments and thus he was free to continue to write. He was famous for his non-pluralistic approach to philosophy. His outlook saw a monistic unity, transcending divisions between logic, metaphysics and ethics. Consistently, his own view combined monism with absolute idealism. Although Bradley did not think of himself as a Hegelian philosopher, his own unique brand of philosophy was inspired by, and contained elements of, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel&#x27;s dialectical method.

==Philosophy==
Bradley rejected the utilitarian and empiricist trends in British philosophy represented by John Locke, David Hume, and John Stuart Mill. Instead, Bradley was a leading member of the philosophical movement known as British idealism, which was strongly influenced by Kant and the German idealists Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling, and Hegel, although Bradley tended to downplay his influences.

In 1909, Bradley published an essay entitled &quot;On Truth and Coherence&quot; in the journal &quot;Mind&quot; (reprinted in &quot;Essays on Truth and Reality&quot;). The essay criticises a form of infallibilist foundationalism in epistemology. The philosopher Robert Stern has argued that in this paper Bradley defends coherence not as an account of justification but as a criterion or test for truth.

Bradley also defends a novel theory of facts. For Bradley, facts can justify our beliefs, but no fact justifies any belief to the point where it is immune from revision. &quot;And the view which I advocate takes them [facts] all as in principle fallible… Facts for it [his view] are true, we may say, just so far as they work, just so far as they contribute to the order of experience. … And there is no ‘fact’ which possesses an absolute right.&quot; Facts of history are, for Bradley, arrived at via an inferential process. &quot;The historical fact then (for us) is a conclusion; … For everything that we say we think we have reasons, our realities are built up of explicit or hidden inferences; in a single word, facts are inferential, and their actuality depends on the correctness of the reasoning which makes them what they are.&quot;

==Moral philosophy==
Bradley&#x27;s view of morality was driven by his criticism of the idea of self used in the current utilitarian theories of ethics. He addressed the central question of &quot;Why should I be moral?&quot;

He opposed individualism, instead defending the view of self and morality as essentially social. Bradley held that our moral duty was founded on the need to cultivate our ideal &quot;good self&quot; in opposition to our &quot;bad self&quot;. However, he acknowledged that society could not be the source of our moral life, of our quest to realise our ideal self. For example, some societies may need moral reform from within, and this reform is based on standards which must come from elsewhere than the standards of that society.

He made the best of this admission in suggesting that the ideal self can be realised through following religion.

His views of the social self in his moral theorising are relevant to the views of Fichte, George Herbert Mead, and pragmatism. They are also compatible with modern views such as those of Richard Rorty and anti-individualism approaches.

==Legacy==
Bradley&#x27;s philosophical reputation declined greatly after his death. The polemical attacks of G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell against &quot;Neo-Hegelianism,&quot; combined with the rise of anti-German sentiment and cultural morass brought upon by the First World War, resulted in British Idealism falling out of favor in Anglo-American philosophy. Bradley was also famously criticised in A. J. Ayer&#x27;s logical positivist work &quot;Language, Truth and Logic&quot; for making statements that do not meet the requirements of positivist verification principle; e.g., statements such as &quot;The Absolute enters into, but is itself incapable of, evolution and progress.&quot;
There has in recent years, however, been a resurgence of interest in Bradley&#x27;s and other idealist philosophers&#x27; work in the Anglo-American academic community.

In 1914, a then-unknown T. S. Eliot wrote his dissertation for a PhD from the Department of Philosophy at Harvard University on Bradley. It was entitled &quot;Knowledge and Experience in the Philosophy of F. H. Bradley&quot;. Due to tensions leading up to and starting the First World War, Eliot was unable to return to Harvard for his oral defence, resulting in the university never conferring the degree. Nevertheless, Bradley remained an influence on Eliot&#x27;s poetry.

<text>The Academy of St Martin in the Fields (ASMF) is an English orchestra, based in London.

John Churchill, then Master of Music at the London church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, and Neville Marriner founded the orchestra as &quot;The Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields&quot;, a small, conductorless string group. The ASMF gave its first concert on 13 November 1959, in the church after which it was named. In 1988, the orchestra dropped the hyphens from its full name.

== History ==
The initial performances as a string orchestra at St Martin-in-the-Fields played a key role in the revival of Baroque performances in England. The orchestra has since expanded to include winds. It remains flexible in size, changing its make-up to suit its repertoire, which ranges from the Baroque to contemporary works.

Neville Marriner continued to perform obbligatos and concertino solos with the orchestra until 1969, and led the orchestra on recordings until the autumn of 1970, when he switched to conducting from the podium from directing the orchestra from the leader&#x27;s desk. Marriner held the title of Life President until his death in 2016. On recordings, besides Marriner, Iona Brown and Kenneth Sillito have led the orchestra, among others.

In 1993 the Academy of St Martin in the Fields became the first – and to date, only – orchestra to be awarded The Queen&#x27;s Award for Export Achievement.

Since 2000 Murray Perahia has held the title of principal guest conductor of the orchestra, and has made commercial recordings with the orchestra as pianist and conductor. 

In May 2011, the orchestra appointed Joshua Bell as its new Music Director, the second person to hold the title in the orchestra&#x27;s history, effective September 2011, with an initial contract of three years. In July 2017, the ASMF extended Bell&#x27;s contract through 2020, an additional three years from his previous contract extension. In April 2024, the ASMF announced an additional extension of Bell&#x27;s contract as its music director through August 2028.

Sally Beamish was composer-in-residence with the ASMF, the first composer so affiliated with the ASMF, scheduled through the 2019–2020 season.

==Chorus==
In 1974 Neville Marriner encouraged László Heltay to form the Chorus of the Academy of St Martin in the Fields, composed of straight, accurate voices and designed to match the instrumental sound of the by then world-famous orchestra. The choir made its debut in 1975 in Düsseldorf and was soon an established feature of the orchestra&#x27;s programming. Its first recording was Bach&#x27;s Mass in B minor in 1977. Heltay&#x27;s choral and Marriner&#x27;s instrumental styles matched perfectly, and the partnership of 25 years took Heltay and the Chorus through numerous concerts, tours and 28 recordings from the major choral repertoire with soloists such as Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Janet Baker, Kiri Te Kanawa, Robert Tear and Anthony Rolfe Johnson. Performances with Heltay as chorus master included the 250th-anniversary of Handel&#x27;s Messiah in Dublin in 1992 and the closing concerts of the handover of Hong Kong in 1997, and their recordings also include the soundtrack for &quot;Amadeus&quot; in 1984, and the UEFA Champions League Anthem. In more recent years, after its dedicated chorus was discontinued the orchestra has worked with a number of independent choral groups, such as the Ambrosian Singers and as of 2024 it is regularly joined by the professional St Martin’s Voices.

==Recordings==
The orchestra&#x27;s first recording was for the L&#x27;Oiseau-Lyre label at Conway Hall on 25 March 1961. It has since accumulated an extensive discography, and is one of the most recorded chamber orchestras in the world, with over 500 sessions. Other labels the orchestra has recorded for include Argo, Capriccio, Chandos, Decca, EMI, Hänssler, Hyperion, and Philips. Earlier recordings by the ASMF from the old Philips label have been reissued on Pentatone. The orchestra has also recorded under the names &quot;Argo Chamber Orchestra&quot;, &quot;London String Players&quot;, and &quot;London Strings&quot;.

The soundtrack to the Oscar-winning film &quot;Amadeus&quot;, a fictional account of the life of the composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and his bitter feud with rival Antonio Salieri features many of Mozart&#x27;s most popular compositions. Recorded by the Academy and Sir Neville Marriner in 1984, the soundtrack to &quot;Amadeus&quot; reached #1 in the Billboard Classical Albums Chart, #56 in the Billboard Popular Albums Chart, has sold over 6.5 million copies to date and received 13 Gold Discs, making it one of the most popular classical music recordings of all time. The partnership between the Academy and its founder Sir Neville Marriner is the most recorded of any orchestra and conductor.

==Chamber Ensemble==
The Academy of St Martin in the Fields Chamber Ensemble was created in 1967 to perform the larger chamber works with players who customarily worked together, instead of the usual string quartet with additional guests. Drawn from the principal players of the Academy and led by violinist Tomo Keller, the Chamber Ensemble performs in all shapes and sizes, from string quintets to octets, and in various other configurations featuring winds. Its touring commitments are extensive and include regular tours of Europe and North America, whilst recording contracts with Philips Classics, Hyperion, and Chandos have led to the release of over thirty CDs.

==Marriner 100==
In April 2024 the Academy marked the centenary of its founder’s birth with concerts in St Martin-in-the-Fields church, the Wigmore Hall, the Royal Festival Hall and Lincoln Cathedral (the city of his birth). The &quot;Marriner 100&quot; programme commenced on 15 April, the actual centenary day, with a concert at the orchestra’s spiritual home, St Martin-in-the-Fields, directed/conducted by leader Tomo Keller, music director Joshua Bell and former Academy flautist Jaime Martin, in which former members of the Academy Chorus, who had sung under Marriner, performed a suite from Die Schöpfung. BBC Radio 3 broadcast the concert as the climax of its &quot;Neville Marriner Day&quot;, with all its programmes devoted to his life, work and legacy. A month long centenary exhibition was held in the church.

<text>Bucky O&#x27;Hare is a fictional character and the hero of an eponymous comic book series and spin-off media, including an animated TV series and various toys and video games. He was created by comic book writer Larry Hama and comic book artist Michael Golden between 1977 and 1978 and made its publishing debut in &quot;Echo of Futurepast&quot; #1 in May 1984 Continuity Comics.

The storyline of Bucky O&#x27;Hare follows a parallel universe where a galactic war is ongoing between the United Animals Federation (U.A.F.) and the sinister Toad Empire. The U.A.F. is an interplanetary republic run by sapient mammals, while the Toad Empire is controlled by a vast computer system known as KOMPLEX, which has led the highly consumerist toad population to fight an expansionist campaign against the rest of the galaxy.

==Overview==
The original &quot;Bucky O&#x27;Hare&quot; was published by Continuity Comics between 1984 and 1985. The series ran in issues #1-6 of the comics anthology series &quot;Echo of Futurepast&quot;, with Hama writing and Michael Golden on pencils. All six parts were collected into an oversized graphic novel in 1986.

The comic book spawned an animated television adaptation, &quot;Bucky O&#x27;Hare and the Toad Wars&quot;, and in 1991, to coincide with its release, the original comic was re-published as its own standalone series, in an expanded form that modified and added to the original artwork, inserting many new panels and scenes into the story. The series was intended to run for six issues, but only five were published between January 1991 and March 1992, leaving the expanded version of the story incomplete. Hama wrote a second &quot;Bucky O&#x27;Hare&quot; arc, which was never published.

When the animated series was broadcast in the United Kingdom in 1992, DC Thomson published their own &quot;Bucky O&#x27;Hare&quot; comic, which ran bi-weekly for twenty issues from March to December of that year. The first six issues of the series re-printed the original US series (#1-5 using the expanded version, and #6 using the original &quot;Echo&quot; version), after which the series moved on to original material (incorporating elements of the animated series) written by Peter Stone, penciled by Andre Coates, and inked by Joel Adams.

The cartoon, meanwhile, ran from September 1991 to January 1992, along with a series of action figures. During that period, Konami produced two tie-in video games based on the property: an NES version and an arcade version, both released in 1992.

==Characters==

Bucky and his crew are members of the S.P.A.C.E. organization, which stands for Sentient Protoplasm Against Colonial Encroachment.
* Bucky O&#x27;Hare – a green hare, captain of a S.P.A.C.E. frigate named &quot;The Righteous Indignation&quot;. His crew was introduced in the comic and consists of:
* Jenny – first mate and pilot, a female cat from the planet Aldebaran with mysterious magical and psionic powers common to the females of her species. They include telepathy, astral projection, energy blasts, and healing. Because of the Prime Directive of the Aldebaran Sisterhood, she keeps these powers secret from the other members of the crew.
* Bruce – a Betelgeusian Berserker Baboon who served as the &quot;Righteous Indignation&quot;″s engineer, before being killed in a power feed back from the photon accelerator, that dissolved his body. In the TV show, he vanishes into another dimension when the ship&#x27;s photon accelerator malfunctioned during battle.
* Willy DuWitt – engineer, a pre-teen human genius from San Francisco who enters the parallel universe via a portal between the ship&#x27;s photon accelerator and his own accelerator at home. He replaced Bruce, the former engineer, who was vaporized when toad plasma weapons caused a massive feedback in the ship&#x27;s photon accelerator. Later, Willy became stranded when his parents turned off the photon accelerator back in his room. Bucky and his crew decide to keep Willy a secret from the Toads. 
* Deadeye Duck – gunner, a four-armed former space pirate duck from Kanopis III. He is missing an eye, and is impatient and violent, preferring to let his four laser pistols do the talking for him. He speaks with a Southern accent.
* AFC Blinky – an advanced AFC (&quot;Android&quot; First Class). It has only one eye and uses the phrase &quot;Calamity and woe!&quot; to identify problem situations for Bucky and his crew-mates.

The members of the Toad Empire introduced in the comic are as follows:
* KOMPLEX – the undisputed ruler of the Toad Empire, this sapient computer program was designed to run the consumerist toad culture, and it did, by conquering it and militarizing it. Its name, in toad language, is an anagram for &#x27;Feed me&#x27;.
* Toad Air Marshall – one of KOMPLEX&#x27;s foremost commanders, with a uniform adorned with medals and a face covered in warts.
* Toad Borg – one of KOMPLEX&#x27;s elite troops, part toad, part robot.
* Storm Toads – the indoctrinated soldiers who serve as the primary attack force for the Empire.
* Storm Toad Death Kommandos – a berserker platoon of the most savage and fearless storm toads, who are kept confined until circumstances require them. Regular toads are advised to stay clear and remain out of sight when they are unleashed, yet they run in fear at the sight of a Berserker Baboon.

In the comic, Bucky and crew escape a toad attack but must rescue Jenny when she is captured by the toads. In the end, a strange, nigh-omnipotent mouse banishes the toads attacking Bucky to &quot;a safe place where the food is bad and taxes are high&quot;. Willy&#x27;s parents, not knowing what the photon accelerator does, deactivate it, trapping him in the parallel universe.

The U.S. comic only ran this one plotline. To coincide with the TV series in the early &#x27;90s, a UK comic reprinted the issues, then produced a further fifteen issues written by Peter Stone, and illustrated by Andre Coates and Joel Adams.

In 2007, Vanguard reprinted the original Bucky O&#x27;Hare comic and two of the UK issues in a digest size collection, similar to a manga. The book is called &quot;Bucky O&#x27;Hare and the Toad Menace&quot; and is printed in black and white. The deluxe edition was also released. Some copies of the &quot;deluxe&quot; edition, however, were in fact the standard edition with a slipcover, not the signed, numbered color version that was advertised.

==In other media==
&quot;Bucky O&#x27;Hare and the Toad Wars!&quot; is a syndicated animated television network show which aired in 1991.

==Video games==

A Bucky O&#x27;Hare game was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992, which required Bucky to rescue each of his crew members (except Bruiser, who is not featured in the game) on a series of planets. As each character was rescued, the player gained the ability to switch between them and Bucky on the fly to deal with different problems. Immediately after regaining his entire crew, they are once again captured and imprisoned on the Toad mother ship. Bucky and Blinky, sharing the same cell, break out and must rescue the remaining members. Afterwards, they continue through the monstrous ship. The gameplay and level design closely resemble that of Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Mega Man&quot; series with elements from Konami&#x27;s &quot;Contra&quot; series and character switching from Konami&#x27;s &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; mixed in.

An arcade game by Konami was also released which allowed up to four players to control Bucky, Jenny, Deadeye or Blinky. It is a run-n-gun game similar to the Konami arcade games &quot;Sunset Riders&quot;, &quot;Mystic Warriors&quot;, &quot;Wild West C.O.W.-Boys of Moo Mesa&quot;, and &quot;Aliens&quot;. The plot of the arcade game allowed players to achieve final victory over the toads by releasing an energy called the Interplanetary Life Force contained within KOMPLEX. The game also featured the original voice cast.

Konami also released a &quot;Bucky O&#x27;Hare&quot; handheld electronic game.

==Toy line==
In 1991, the toy company Hasbro released a line of action figures based closely on the &quot;Bucky O&#x27;Hare&quot; series. Most of the major characters were represented: &quot;Bucky O&#x27;Hare, Deadeye Duck, Willy DuWitt, Blinky, Bruiser&quot; and &quot;Commander Dogstar&quot; were the heroes released, and &quot;Toadborg, Air Marshall, Storm Toad Trooper&quot; and &quot;Al Negator&quot; were the villains that made it to the shelves. Two vehicles were released as well. The good guy vehicle was the Toad Croaker. The bad guy vehicle was the Toad Double Bubble.

The line was terminated before the next two series of action figures could be finished. There are several photographs available online of the unreleased figures, some completely painted with accessories, and others as unpainted prototypes. At least one photo shows the fully packaged &quot;Jenny&quot;, likely because this figure was completed in time for the first release, but was delayed to be part of the second. Several others show &quot;Pitstop Pete&quot; and &quot;Sly Leezard&quot; both as unpainted and as completed figures. &quot;Bucky&quot; in a spacesuit, &quot;Rumble Bee, Kamikaze Kamo&quot; and &quot;Total Terror Toad&quot; are the other finished figures. The mobile configuration of the chief villain &quot;Komplex&quot; (&quot;Komplex-2-Go&quot; in the arcade game), &quot;Digger&quot;, and &quot;Tri-Bot&quot; (a minor villain from the final episode) are the other unpainted prototypes known to exist from these photos. More recently, both an unpainted prototype and a fully finalized figure of Jenny was revealed online in a review video.

In 2017, Boss Fight Studios began to release new Bucky O&#x27;Hare action figures. These updated moulds feature multiple points of articulation and interchangeable hands and faces. The first two to be released were Bucky O&#x27;Hare and the much anticipated First Mate Jenny. Later releases included Stealth Mission Bucky, Astral Projection Jenny, Deadeye Duck, and the Storm Toad Trooper. Two promotional figures were also released; an Easter themed Bucky (moulded in chocolate themed colours) and a Corsair Canard Deadeye Duck who was packaged in a promotional steel lunch-box featuring Bucky O&#x27;Hare concept art. The line now has seen the introduction of Bruiser who is listed as a deluxe figure, and comes packaged in a window-box with Bruiser artwork and bio. Bringing a total of five figure moulds produced and nine figure variants released. The final two releases were a new figure mould of Mimi Lafleur, and an Aniverse colour variant of the Storm Toad. After that, Boss Fight Studio lost the license to produce any further figures, due to Continuity Comics having lost interest in the line.

==Legacy==
During the 1990s, VHS tapes were released by Family Home Entertainment. Due to Sunbow Productions&#x27; lack of a US home distributor currently (it was formerly Rhino, then Sony Wonder, which has shut down), the cartoon had been stalled in releasing a Region 1 DVD. A company called Exposure Entertainment was supposed to have released the 13 episodes on DVD in North America, in Region 1 NTSC format for the first time, but the overall release was either very rare and limited, or no set had appeared at all. The same company had a similar issue with their first season release of &quot;Biker Mice from Mars&quot;, but it did have a Region 2 PAL DVD release in the UK by Metrodome Distribution, which as of 2013 is now out of print. Hasbro has recently acquired the rights to most of their cartoon library, including &quot;Bucky O&#x27;Hare&quot;, but it is unknown whether the series will see a DVD release in Region 1.

Comic book artist Neal Adams and Continuity created a short online 3-D cartoon of Bucky O&#x27;Hare.

In 2006, Neal Adams was reportedly working on a Bucky O&#x27;Hare film project. No updates were provided and the project is presumably cancelled.

The graphic novel &quot;Neal Adams Presents Bucky O&#x27;Hare and the Toad Menace&quot; was re-released in 2008 in manga format by Vanguard Press.

<doc id="473852" wikidata="Q3249420" url="?curid=473852" title="List of members of the European Parliament (1999–2004)">
<text>During the fifth term (1999–2004), there were 626 members of parliament divided among the 15 member states. As part of the 2004 enlargement, the national parliaments of the 10 new member states sent a total of 162 observers to the European Parliament from April 2003. On 1 May 2004, upon the countries&#x27; accession, the observers became MEPs until the start of the next term (20 July 2004) elected in the June 2004 elections.

<text>The A48 is a trunk road in Great Britain running from the A40 at Highnam, west of Gloucester, England, to the A40 at Carmarthen, Wales. Before the Severn Bridge opened on 8 September 1966, it was a major route between England and South Wales. For most of its route, it runs almost parallel to the M4 motorway. During times of high winds at the Severn Bridge, the A48 is used as part of the diversion route and is still marked as a Holiday Route.

From Gloucester, the A48 runs through the villages of Minsterworth, Westbury-on-Severn, connects to a link road to Cinderford in the Forest of Dean then through Newnham, Blakeney and since 1995, bypassing Lydney on the west bank of the River Severn. It crosses the England–Wales border at Chepstow and continues westwards close to the South Wales coast passing Newport, Cardiff, Cowbridge, Bridgend, Pyle, Port Talbot, Neath and Swansea, before terminating at the junction with the A40 near the centre of Carmarthen.

==Route==
===Highnam to Cardiff===
The A48 from Highnam to Newport runs adjacent to the River Severn. After running through a series of villages, it crosses the England–Wales border at Chepstow. The section between Higham and Chepstow is still a primary route of some importance for the Forest of Dean. 
From the M4 Motorway at J15 near Swindon, traffic is directed for Wales if it is over the Severn Bridge weight limit of 44 tonnes. Traffic is directed onto the A419, then onto the A417 after Cirencester, and at Gloucester, onto the A40. This road has some speed cameras, as there have previously been incidents here, and have been erected to prevent them from happening again. During busy periods, such as the Severn Bore, this road may become busy with parked cars near the river&#x27;s edge. Apart from morning and evening rush hours, the road is generally quite empty and free running, with no heavy traffic reports. The road also runs next to the Forest of Dean. The woods may be viewed from the roadside, as may the hills of the Dean. There is a level crossing in Lydney. Until Chepstow, there is a height limit under the low railway bridges. Tall vehicles are directed to Newport on the A40. For some parts of this route, short distance dual carriageways occur, especially on steep hills. 
At Chepstow, the road links Gloucestershire with Monmouthshire. The road runs through Chepstow. There is access to the Forest of Dean in Chepstow. At the end of the road in Chepstow (at the roundabout), the Primary Route ends here, and it meets the A466, a road that provides access to the Wye Valley and to the M48 motorway, originally the M4. Access to the M4 is available on this road. The A48 becomes a secondary route here, and continues bypassing Caldicot, Caerwent and Langstone.

The A48 then continues to M4 junction 24, from which point it is also known as the Southern Distributor Road, which is entirely a dual carriageway with two lanes in each direction around the southern end of Newport until M4 junction 28. From junction 28 it remains a dual carriageway until just after the Celtic Way roundabout where it becomes a single carriageway with four lanes past Castleton, and then merges with the junction 29A of the A48(M) motorway at St Mellons, where it again becomes a dual carriageway with two lanes in each direction, where it is known as the Eastern Avenue until the Gabalfa Interchange, where it is known as the Western Avenue and is largely a single carriageway with four lanes until Culverhouse Cross interchange.

===Cardiff to Carmarthen===
From the Culverhouse Cross interchange on the western boarder of Cardiff the road is mostly a single carriageway with two lanes until Cowbridge, where it becomes the Cowbridge Bypass which is a dual carriageway, until again it becomes a single carriageway with two lanes until Bridgend when it is a dual carriageway again. From Bridgend it becomes a single carriageway, until Port Talbot where it is a dual carriageway, and originally known as the A48(M) (Port Talbot Bypass) until the M4 was extended. The A48 then ends on the western end of the Briton Ferry Bridge at junction 42 of the M4 and starts again at junction 44 where again it is a single carriageway until the end of the M4 at junction 49 where it becomes a dual carriageway and forms part of the main trunk road between Pont Abraham Services to Carmarthen where the A48 ends.

==Junction list==
















==History of the road number==

The original (1923) route of the A48 was Worcester to Carmarthen via Malvern, Ledbury, Ross-on-Wye, Monmouth, Newport, Cardiff, Bridgend, Neath and Llanelli. In 1935 it was rerouted east of Newport, replacing the A437 between Newport and Gloucester. The road from Worcester to Newport became part of the A449, apart from the section between Ross and Monmouth (which became part of the A40).

==Road safety==
In June 2008, the GloucesterChepstow stretch of the A48 was named as the most dangerous road in South West England. This single carriageway had 45 fatal and serious injury collisions between 2004 and 2006, and was rated as medium risk in the EuroRAP report published by the Road Safety Foundation.

On 6 March 2023, five people were found after they had been missing for two days. Three of the five were found dead following a believed car crash after their car was found on the A48 in St Mellons, with the other two injured.

<doc id="473856" wikidata="Q1208842" url="?curid=473856" title="Seal script">
<text>Seal script or sigillary script () is a style of writing Chinese characters that was common throughout the latter half of the 1st millennium BC. It evolved organically out of bronze script during the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BC). The variant of seal script used in the state of Qin eventually became comparatively standardized, and was adopted as the formal script across all of China during the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC). It was still widely used for decorative engraving and seals during the Han dynasty (202 BC220 AD).

The literal translation given above was coined during the Han dynasty, and reflects the role of the script being reduced to ceremonial inscriptions.

== Types ==
The term &quot;seal script&quot; may refer to several distinct varieties, including the large seal script and the small seal script. Without qualification, &quot;seal script&quot; usually refers to the small seal script—that is, the lineage which evolved within the state of Qin during the Eastern Zhou dynasty (771–221 BC), which was later standardized under Qin Shi Huang (). The term &quot;large seal script&quot; may itself refer to a broad range of forms, including Qin forms older than the small seal script—but also earlier Western Zhou forms, or even oracle bone characters. Due to this imprecision, modern scholars tend to avoid using the term &quot;large seal script&quot;.

== Development ==
There were several different variants of seal script which developed independently in each kingdom during the Eastern Zhou. One of these, the bird-worm seal script, is named for its intricate decorations on the defining strokes, and was used in the states of Wu, Chu, and Yue. It was found on several artifacts including the Spear of Fuchai and the Sword of Goujian. As a southern state, Chu was influenced by Wuyue. Chu produced bronze broadswords that were similar to those from Wuyue, but not as intricate. Chu also used the bird-worm style, which was borrowed by the Wu and Yue states.

== Unified small seal script ==

The Qin script—as exemplified in bronze inscriptions prior to unification—had evolved organically from the Zhou script starting in the Spring and Autumn period. Beginning around the Warring States period, it became vertically elongated with a regular appearance. This was the period of maturation for the small seal script. It was systematized by prime minister Li Si during the reign of Qin Shi Huang through the elimination of most character variants, and was imposed as the imperial standard. Through Chinese commentaries, it is known that Li Si compiled the &quot;&quot;, a partially-extant wordbook listing some 3,300 Chinese characters in the small seal script. Their form is characterized by being less rectangular and more squarish.

In the popular history of Chinese characters, the small seal script is traditionally considered to be ancestral to clerical script, which in turn prefigured every other script in use today. However, recent archaeological discoveries and scholarship have led some scholars to conclude that the direct ancestor of clerical script was proto-clerical script, which in turn evolved out of the lesser-known &quot;vulgar&quot; or &quot;popular&quot; writing of the late Warring States to Qin period.

The first known character dictionary was the 3rd-century BC &#x27;, collated and referenced by Liu Xiang and his son Liu Xin; it is no longer extant. Not long after, the &#x27; () was written by Xu Shen. The &quot;Shuowen&quot;″s 9,353 entries reproduce the standardized small seal forms for each entry, organized under 540 radicals.

== Computer encoding ==
It is anticipated that small seal script forms will eventually be encoded in &quot;The Unicode Standard&quot;. The code points on the Tertiary Ideographic Plane have been tentatively allocated.

<doc id="473857" wikidata="Q1197212" url="?curid=473857" title="Kyoko Koizumi">
<text> (born February 4, 1966) is a Japanese singer and actress. She is signed to Victor Entertainment.

==Career==
In 1981, Kyoko Koizumi participated in and won the Star Tanjo! programme and released her first single in March 1982. She obtained several number one hits on the Oricon charts in 1984: &quot;Nagisa no Haikara Ningyo / Kaze no Magical&quot;, &quot;Yamato Nadeshiko Shichi Henge&quot; and &quot;The Stardust Memory&quot;, the latter holding the top spot over the end of 1984 and the beginning of 1985, and thereafter established herself as one of Japan&#x27;s most popular pop idols, alongside rivals Seiko Matsuda and Akina Nakamori.

Her biggest hit (あなたに会えてよかった) came in 1991, which sold more than a million copies in Japan alone. Koizumi went on to release another single (優しい雨) which also sold over a million copies in 1993.

Koizumi had singles reach the Top Ten for 12 consecutive years between 1983 and 1994, a female solo artist record, until this was broken by Namie Amuro. In the 1990s, she released a few dance remixes on vinyl only under the Koizumix Production moniker. She has worked with Yoko Kanno who composed the music for Koizumi&#x27;s 1996 album, &quot;Otoko no Ko Onna no Ko&quot;. She had her first hit single in 18 years when her version of the song &quot;Shiosai no Memorī&quot; from the 2013 NHK morning television drama &quot;Amachan&quot;, in which Koizumi also acted, reached number 2 on the Oricon Singles Chart. With that, Koizumi made her 6th appearance (as a special guest performer) in the annual Red and White Song Festival, having previously participated from 1984 to 1988.

From mid-90s onward, Koizumi shifted her focus onto acting. As an actress, she played in numerous dramas and movies, most notably, she was cast in two of the most successful movies in Japan ever: as the serial killer in &quot;Bayside Shakedown: The Movie&quot; (1998) and as the witch in &quot;Onmyoji&quot; (2001).

She starred in Toshiaki Toyoda&#x27;s 2006 film &quot;Hanging Garden&quot; and Kiyoshi Kurosawa&#x27;s 2008 film &quot;Tokyo Sonata&quot;. She starred in Kurosawa&#x27;s 2012 television drama &quot;Penance&quot;.

Koizumi was given the Best Actress award at the 1989 Yokohama Film Festival for her work in the film &quot;Kaito Ruby&quot;. She won the award for best actress at the 26th Hochi Film Awards for &quot;Kaza Hana&quot;. She also won the award for Best Actress at the 66th Mainichi Film Awards for &quot;Mainichi Kaasan&quot;.

She featured in the French-Japanese film, &quot;Umami&quot;, directed by Slony Sow and starring Gérard Depardieu, which was filmed in Hokkaido, Japan and Saumur, France.

==Personal life==
She married actor Masatoshi Nagase in 1995, the couple divorced in 2004.

==Discography==
As of 2023, Koizumi released 27 original albums, 22 compilation albums, 40 physical singles, 10 digital singles and 17 home-videos.

<text>The A69 is a major northern trunk road in England, running east–west across the Pennines, through the counties of Tyne and Wear, Northumberland and Cumbria. Originally, the road started in the centre of Newcastle upon Tyne then later near Birtley, but since the creation of the A1 Western Bypass around Newcastle upon Tyne, it now starts at Denton Burn, a suburb of Newcastle upon Tyne.

The route from the A1 junction to Carlisle city centre is 54 miles (87 km).

== Settlements on the route ==
* Denton Burn
* West Denton
* Throckley
* (Corbridge)
* (Hexham)
* (Haydon Bridge)
* Bardon Mill
* Melkridge
* (Haltwhistle)
* (Brampton)
* Warwick Bridge
* Warwick-on-Eden
* Botcherby
* Carlisle
Places with parentheses are indicative of historically being on the A69, but have now been bypassed

== Description of the route ==
The road runs westwards from the A1 at Denton Burn in Newcastle upon Tyne through the suburbs of Denton Burn and West Denton before a junction with the A6085 and the B6323. It continues west and passes over what was Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, which until now has been south of the road, at Milecastle 13 on the wall. Hereafter the road is always south of the wall. The road carries on up the Tyne valley, bypassing the village of Corbridge and the market town Hexham. The A69 crosses the River Tyne west of Hexham (Constantius Bridge), re-crosses it west of the village of Haydon Bridge, and yet again as it bypasses Haltwhistle.

After crossing the border into Cumbria, the A69 by-passes the town of Brampton, before coming to a roundabout junction with the A689 road. The A69 turns left here and travels through the village of Warwick Bridge, which is planned to be by-passed in the future. Following a short piece of dual carriageway, the A69 comes to Junction 43 of the M6 motorway, which skirts the eastern edge of Carlisle.

The A69 into Carlisle has the name Warwick Road, and is known to be one of the most congested roads in the county. At Saint Aidan&#x27;s church, the A69 turns right up Victoria Place, and meets the A7 road at a busy traffic-light controlled crossroads, where it terminates.

The road forms part of the unsigned Euroroute E18. It is maintained by RoadLink.

Historical sections of road numbered A69

At its eastern end, the A69 historically ran from its current terminus with the A1 at Denton Burn eastward along Westgate Road (now the western end of the A186) in Newcastle upon Tyne, terminating at the junction between Westgate Road and Neville Street in central Newcastle near Newcastle Central station.

The construction of the Gateshead Western Bypass saw the section of A69 from Denton Burn into central Newcastle renumbered A186, with the A69 then passing over Scotswood Bridge and following the Gateshead Western Bypass to Birtley where it joined the A1(M). The later construction of the Newcastle Western Bypass saw the Gateshead Western Bypass section renumbered A1 as the A1 was diverted to the west of Newcastle upon Tyne city centre and over the new Blaydon Bridge, with the A69 curtailed to its current terminus at Denton Burn.

== Standard of route ==
The A69 is a major route linking the north-east and north-west of England, and as such has primary status throughout. For about between its start at Newcastle and the Hexham by-pass the A69 is dual carriageway standard, and is largely grade separated. The rest of the route, apart from a short dual carriageway section near the M6 Junction 43 is single carriageway, with occasional climbing lanes.

== Haydon Bridge bypass ==

Haydon Bridge was the last village on the A69 in Northumberland to gain a bypass. This was officially opened on Wednesday 25 March 2009 and passes to the south of the village with a new bridge over the River South Tyne to the west of the village.

== Safety ==
A report on the A69 in 2011 noted that in the previous year 82 accidents were recorded with 130 injuries, 10 serious injuries and four deaths. Campaigning has been ongoing to get the section from Hexham to Carlisle dualled to allow vehicles to overtake safely.

<text>Fiji was a British Crown colony from 1874 to 1970, and an independent dominion in the Commonwealth from 1970 to 1987. During this period, the head of state was the British monarch, but in practice the functions of the crown were normally exercised locally by the governor prior to independence (on 10 October 1970), and by the governor-general prior to the proclamation of a republic on 7 October 1987.

From 1877 to 3 July 1952, governors of Fiji were also high commissioners for the Western Pacific.

==List of governors of Fiji (1874–1970)==
Following is a list of people who have served as governor of Fiji.

In 1970, Fiji gained independence from the United Kingdom. After independence, the viceroy in Fiji was the governor-general of Fiji.

<text>The Secret of Hegel: Being the Hegelian System in Origin, Principle, Form and Matter is the full title of an important work on the philosophical system of German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) by James Hutchison Stirling (1820–1909), a Scottish idealist philosopher.

The 1st edition of &quot;The Secret of Hegel&quot; was published in 2 vols. in 1865 by the London publisher Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts &amp; Green. Vol. 1 contains lxxiv + 465 pages, and Vol. 2 contains viii + 624 pages.

The 2nd, revised, edition of &quot;The Secret of Hegel&quot; was published in 1 vol. in 1898, and contains xiii + 761 pages. The 2nd, revised, edition (1898) was published simultaneously by 3 different publishers, as follows:
(1) Edinburgh: Oliver &amp; Boyd 
(2) London: Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co, Ltd. 
(3) New York: G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons

This work has influenced many British philosophers and helped to create the philosophical movement known as British idealism.

==The secret==
Stirling wrote:
:The secret of Hegel may be indicated at shortest thus: As Aristotle—with considerable assistance from Plato—made explicit the abstract Universal that was implicit in Socrates, so Hegel— with less considerable assistance from Fichte and Schelling—made explicit the concrete Universal that was implicit in Kant.

On page 84, Stirling gave an even shorter condensation: &quot;Here is the secret of Hegel, or rather a schema to a key to it: Quantity—Time and Space—Empirical Realities.&quot;

In Chapter 1 he finds analogies between 16th century English drama and 19th century German idealism and compares Hegel to Shakespeare: &quot;In the ferment of the English Drama, Marlow , Ben Jonson, and others may, even beside Shakespeare, be correctly enough named principals; yet it is the last alone whom we properly term outcome.&quot;

In Chapter 11 he expresses some reservations: &quot;In regard to Hegel, satisfaction and dissatisfaction are seldom far from each other, but the latter predominates. If, for a moment, the words light up, and a view be granted, as it were, into the inner mysteries, they presently quench themselves again in the appearance of mere arbitrary classification and artificial nomenclature.&quot;

At the end of the book a political intention becomes clearer as he invokes Hegel against the free thinking, “self will” and atomism he understands as a consequence of the Aufklärung (Enlightenment): “Hegel, indeed, has no object but ‘reconciling and neutralising atomism’ once again to restore to us ‘and in the new light of the new thought’ Immortality and Free-will, Christianity and God.”

==Readers&#x27; comments==
John Stuart Mill, in his letter of November 6, 1867 to Alexander Bain, wrote:
:Besides these I have been toiling through Stirling’s &quot;Secret of Hegel&quot;. It is right to learn what Hegel is &amp; one learns it only too well from Stirling’s book. I say &quot;too well&quot; because I found by actual experience of Hegel that conversancy with him tends to deprave one’s intellect. The attempt to unwind an apparently infinite series of self–contradictions, not disguised but openly faced &amp; coined into [illegible word] science by being stamped with a set of big abstract terms, really if persisted in impairs the acquired delicacy of perception of false reasoning &amp; false thinking which has been gained by years of careful mental discipline with terms of real meaning. For some time after I had finished the book all such words as reflexion, development, evolution, &amp;c., gave me a sort of sickening feeling which I have not yet entirely got rid of.

J E Erdmann (A History of Philosophy vol. 3 p 197 tr W S Hough, London 1899) wrote:
:In his otherwise so admirable work, &quot;The Secret of Hegel&quot;, … Fichte and Schelling are put far too much into the background.

Frederick Copleston (&quot;A History of Philosophy&quot; vol. VII, p. 12) wrote:
:...we may be inclined to smile at J. H. Stirling&#x27;s picture of Hegel as the great champion of Christianity.

Vladimir Lenin:
:The secret was well kept!

<doc id="473873" wikidata="Q609214" url="?curid=473873" title="Antrim (borough)">
<text>Antrim (named after the town of Antrim) was a local government district in Northern Ireland. It was one of twenty-six districts created in 1973, and was granted borough status on 9 May 1977. The borough covered an area of some and had a population of 53,428 according to the 2011 census. It was situated about north-west of Belfast. It bordered the north and east shores of Lough Neagh, the largest fresh water lake in the United Kingdom, and included the towns of Antrim, Toomebridge, Crumlin, Randalstown, Parkgate and Templepatrick. The council headquarters were located on the outskirts of Antrim town. Although the borough was not within the Belfast Metropolitan Area, it housed the city&#x27;s international airport and many commuter villages.

==Borough council==

The borough was sub-divided into three electoral areas: Antrim South-East, Antrim North-West and Antrim Town, from which 19 members were elected. As of February 2011, the following political parties were represented: 5 Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), 5 Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), 3 Sinn Féin, 3 Alliance Party, 2 Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and 1 Traditional Unionist Voice. An election was held every four years using the proportional representation system.

A mayor and deputy mayor were elected from among the councillors at the borough council&#x27;s annual meeting in June. For the civic year 2012/2013 the Mayor of Antrim was Roy Thompson (DUP) and the Deputy Mayor was Roderick Swann (UUP).

==Economy==
The economy of the area revolved around construction, distribution, transport and hospitality. It had a well-developed transport infrastructure that provided easy access to all the main external gateways for Northern Ireland and all parts of the region. Antrim Town lies on two of the main transport corridors, the Belfast – Derry corridor and the Southern corridor. Belfast International Airport was located within the borough, only from Antrim town.

==Parliamentary representation==
Together with part of the districts of Newtownabbey and Lisburn, it formed the South Antrim constituency for elections to the Westminster Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly.

<text>The A487, officially the Fishguard to Bangor Trunk Road, is a trunk road in Wales that follows the coast from Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, in the south, to Bangor, Gwynedd, in the north.

==Route==
The road starts at a junction with the A40 in Haverfordwest and travels northwest to St David&#x27;s to switch northeast through Fishguard, Cardigan, Aberaeron, Aberystwyth, Machynlleth and Corris.

Through the town of Fishguard, the road width in places is a very narrow single lane, leading to many traffic issues, especially with heavy goods vehicles (HGVs). From 2010, articulated HGVs were diverted from the section between Cardigan and Fishguard because of this, and routed instead via the A478 road to Penblewin, then the A40 to Fishguard via Haverfordwest. However, there were still problems to some extent.

The road continues to Dolgellau multiplexing with the A470 north of the Cross Foxes inn. After Dolgellau, the road continues to multiplex with the A470, re-emerging just north of Trawsfynydd then passing through Penrhyndeudraeth and Porthmadog. The road terminates where it meets the Menai Suspension Bridge near Bangor.

==History==
The section of road in the Dulas valley between the River Dyfi near Machynlleth and Corris was built in the 1840s at the instigation of the local slate quarry owners to replace the old turnpike road on the opposite side of the valley. It may have utilised part of the formation of the Roman Sarn Helen. From 1859, the narrow-gauge Corris Railway followed the same route.

The site of Dolgellau railway station, along with approximately of trackbed of the Ruabon–Barmouth line, was used to construct the Dolgellau bypass in the late 1970s.

In 1989–90, Cardigan was bypassed south of the town with a new Priory Bridge over the River Teifi and a short 3-lane section between the bridge and the junction with the A478.

A bypass was opened in 1994 avoiding Y Felinheli on the section between Caernarfon and Bangor.

Between Penrhyndeudraeth and Porthmadog, the road passed over a mile-long embankment, known as The Cob. Until 2003, drivers had to pay a charge to cross The Cob. In 2009, the Welsh Assembly Government published a compulsory purchase order to construct the Porthmadog, Minffordd and Tremadog bypass, which would reduce the amount of through traffic in the town. Work started on the project in 2010, the route of which passes under the Ffestiniog Railway, and then crosses over the Welsh Highland Railway. The original route over The Cob was renumbered as the A4971. The Porthmadog bypass was officially opened on 17 October 2011.

The section between Porthmadog and Llanwnda has been improved. The new section bypasses Llanllyfni and Penygroes, in parts utilizing the old trackbed of the Caernarfon to Afon Wen railway line. In April 2007, the new section had to be resurfaced in its entirety after it became apparent that the wrong type of stone had been used for the surface tarmac.

A bat bridge was built over the Groeslon bypass in 2010 to guide lesser horseshoe bats across the road.

The preferred route for the £100m Caernarfon-Bontnewydd bypass had been announced; Caernarfon from the northern end of the Pen-y-groes bypass to the western end of the Y Felinheli bypass. This bypass was under construction in 2021 and opened 19 February 2022.

In 2018, Pembrokeshire County Council proposed to build a bypass to the east of Newgale which would replace the road section which was flooded during the 2013–14 United Kingdom winter floods.

<text>The Shuowen Jiezi is a Chinese dictionary compiled by Xu Shen , during the Eastern Han dynasty (25–220 CE). While prefigured by earlier reference works for Chinese characters like the &quot;Erya&quot; (), the &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; contains the first comprehensive analysis of characters in terms of their structure, where Xu attempted to provide rationales for their construction. It was also the first to organize its entries into sections according to shared components called radicals.

== Background ==
Xu Shen was a scholar of the Five Classics during the Han dynasty. He finished compiling the &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; in 100 CE. However, due to an unfavorable imperial attitude towards scholarship, he waited until 121 before his son Xu Chong presented it to Emperor An of Han, along with a memorial.

In analyzing the structure of characters and defining the words represented by them, Xu strove to clarify the meaning of the pre-Han classics, so as to ensure order and render their use in governance unquestioned. Xu&#x27;s motives also included a pragmatic and political dimension: according to Boltz, the compilation of the &quot;Shuowen&quot; &quot;cannot be held to have arisen from a purely linguistic or lexicographical drive&quot;. During the Han era, the prevalent theory of language was the Confucian Rectification of Names, a line of thinking revolving around the use the correct names to ensure proper governance. The postface explains:

Previous Chinese dictionaries like the &quot;Erya&quot; () and &quot;Fangyan&quot; were limited, with entries loosely organized into semantic categories, and merely listing synonymous characters. This layout was comparatively unsuited for looking up characters. In the &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot;, Xu instead organized characters by their apparent shared graphical components. Boltz calls this &quot;a major conceptual innovation in the understanding of the Chinese writing system&quot;.

== Structure ==

Xu wrote the &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; to analyze seal script characters that evolved slowly and organically throughout the mid-to-late Zhou dynasty in the state of Qin, and which were then standardized during the Qin dynasty and promulgated empire-wide. Thus, Needham et al. (1986: 217) describe the &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; as &quot;a paleographic handbook as well as a dictionary&quot;.

The dictionary includes a preface and 15 chapters. The first 14 chapters are character entries; the 15th and final chapter is divided into two parts: a postface and an index of section headers. Xu Shen states in his postface that the dictionary has 9,353 character entries, plus 1,163 graphic variants, with a total length of 133,441 characters. The transmitted texts vary slightly in content, owing to the omissions and emendations of later commentators. Modern editions have 9,831 characters and 1,279 variants.

== Sections ==

Xu Shen sorted the Chinese lexicon into 540 sections, under section headers generally referred to as &quot;radicals&quot; in English: these may be entire characters or simplifications thereof, which also serve as components shared by all the characters in that section. The first section header was ( &#x27;first&#x27;) and the last was (), the last character of the Earthly Branches.

Xu&#x27;s choice of sections appears in large part to have been driven by the desire to create an unbroken, systematic sequence among the headers themselves, such that each had a natural, intuitive relationship (e.g. structural, semantic or phonetic) with the ones before and after, as well as by the desire to reflect cosmology. In the process, he included many section headers that are not considered ones today, such as ( &#x27;flame&#x27;) and ( &#x27;bear&#x27;), which modern dictionaries list under the heading. He also included as section headers all the sexagenary cycle characters, that is, the ten Heavenly Stems and twelve Earthly Branches. As a result, unlike modern dictionaries which attempt to maximize the number of characters under each radical, 34 &quot;Shuowen&quot; radicals have no characters under them, while 159 have only one. From a modern lexicographical perspective, Xu&#x27;s 540 radicals can seem &quot;enigmatic&quot; or &quot;illogical&quot;. For instance, he included   as a radical indexing only the rare ( &#x27;stamen&#x27;)—instead of listing the character under the common .

== Entries ==
A typical &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; character entry consists of:
# The seal script form of the character
# A short definition, usually consisting of a single synonym—occasionally through a &quot;shengxun&quot; pun, as seen in the &quot;Shiming&quot;, and
# The character&#x27;s pronunciation, indicated by a homophone
# In the case of compound graphs, analysis of the character&#x27;s structure in terms of semantic or phonetic components.

Individual entries can also include graphical variants, secondary definitions, information regarding their regional use, citations from pre-Han texts, and further phonetic information, typically provided in a ( &#x27;read as if&#x27;) notation.

In addition to the seal script form, two other variant styles were included if they differed in form—called &#x27;ancient script&#x27; ( ) and &#x27;Zhou script&#x27; ( ), not to be confused with the Zhou dynasty. The &quot;Zhou&quot; characters were taken from the no-longer extant &quot;Shizhoupian&quot;, an early copybook traditionally attributed to &quot;Historian Zhou&quot;, from the court of King Xuan of Zhou (827–782 BCE). Wang Guowei and Tang Lan argued that the structure and style of these characters suggested a later date, but some modern scholars such as Qiu Xigui argue for the original dating. The ancient characters were based on the characters used in pre-Qin copies of the classics recovered from the walls of houses where they had been hidden to escape the burning of books ordered by Qin Shihuang. Xu believed that these were the most ancient characters available, since Confucius would have used the oldest characters to best convey the meaning of the texts. However, Wang Guowei and other scholars have shown that they were regional variant forms in the eastern areas during the Warring States period, from only slightly earlier than the Qin seal script.

Even as copyists transcribed the main text of the book in clerical script in the late Han, and then in modern standard script in the centuries to follow, the small seal characters continued to be copied in their own seal script to preserve their structure, as were the ancient and Zhou-script characters.

== Structural analysis ==

The title of the work draws a basic distinction between two types of characters:
* , characters consisting of a single graphic element (such as the character itself), and
* , characters composed from multiple elements (such as itself, composed of and ).
Thus, the work&#x27;s title means &quot;commenting on&quot; ( &#x27;comment&#x27;, &#x27;explain&#x27;) basic characters, and &quot;analyzing&quot; ( &#x27;separate&#x27;, &#x27;analyze&#x27;) compound characters.

Although the &quot;six principles&quot; ( ) of traditional character classification had been mentioned by earlier authors, Xu Shen&#x27;s postface was the first work to provide definitions and examples. However, only the first four of these principles occur in the body of the dictionary.

* Simple indicatives ( ) are named explicitly in the dictionary by labelling character entries in the typical formula &quot;A is B ... (is) simple indicative&quot; (A B ... ()), where B is a definition for the character A.
* Pictograms ( ) are similarly labelled with the formula &quot;A is B ... (is) pictograph&quot; (A B ... ()).
* Phono-semantic compounds ( ) are implicitly defined by the formula &quot;A ... from X, [with] Y sound&quot; (A... X, Y ), meaning that element X plays a semantic role in A, while Y has a similar pronunciation. In his 10th-century edition, Xu Xuan removed the phonetic marker in cases where the pronunciations were no longer similar.
* Compound indicatives ( ) are rarely labelled directly, but more commonly identified by the formula &quot;A ... from X from Y&quot; (A ... X Y), indicating that character A is obtained through the graphical juxtaposition of X and Y.
* Loangraphs ( ) are not new characters, but rather new uses of existing characters, and are never labelled in the dictionary.
* No derived characters ( ) are identified by their definitions in the &quot;Shuowen&quot;.

According to Imre Galambos, the function of the &quot;Shuowen&quot; was educational. Since Han studies of writing are attested to have begun by pupils of 8 years old, Xu Shen&#x27;s categorization of characters was proposed to be understood as a mnemonic methodology for juvenile students.

== Textual history and scholarship ==
Although the original Han dynasty &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; text has been lost, it was transmitted through handwritten copies for centuries. The oldest extant manuscript currently resides in Japan, and consists of a six-page fragment dating to the Tang dynasty, amounting to about 2% of the entire text. The fragment concerns the section header. The earliest post-Han scholar known to have researched and emended this dictionary was Li Yangbing (; ), who according to Boltz is &quot;usually regarded as something of a of [&quot;Shuowen&quot;] studies, owing to his idiosyncratic and somewhat capricious editing of the text&quot;.

=== &quot;Shuowen Jiezi Xichuan&quot; ===
&quot;Shuowen&quot; scholarship improved greatly during the Southern Tang and Song dynasties, as well as during the later Qing dynasty. The most important Northern Song scholars were the brothers Xu Xuan (; 916–991) and Xu Kai (; 920–974). In 986, Emperor Taizong of Song ordered Xu Xuan and other editors to publish an authoritative edition of the dictionary, which became the &quot;Shuowen Jiezi Xichuan&quot; ().

Xu Xuan&#x27;s textual criticism has been especially vital for all subsequent scholarship, since his restoration of the damage done by Li Yangbing resulted in the closest version we have to the original, and the basis for all later editions. Xu Kai, in turn, focused on exegetical study, analyzing the meaning of Xu Shen&#x27;s text, appending supplemental characters, and adding &quot;fanqie&quot; pronunciation glosses for each entry. Among Qing-era &quot;Shuowen&quot; scholars, some like Zhu Junsheng (; 1788–1858), followed the textual criticism model of Xu Xuan, while others like Gui Fu (; 1736–1805) and Wang Yun (; 1784–1834) followed the analytical exegesis model of Xu Kai.

=== Later and contemporary study ===
While the &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; has historically been very valuable to scholars and was the most important early source regarding the structure of Chinese characters, much of its analysis and many of its definitions have been superseded by later scholarship, in particular that resulting from the late 19th-century discovery of oracle bone script. It is no longer seen as authoritative for definitions and graphical analysis. Xu lacked access to the earlier oracle bone inscriptions, as well as bronzeware inscriptions from the Late Shang and Western Zhou periods, which often provide valuable insight. For example, Xu categorized ( &#x27;be concerned&#x27;, &#x27;consider&#x27;) under the  &#x27;think&#x27; radical, noting its phonetic as ( &#x27;tiger&#x27;). However, early forms of the character attested on bronzes have a signific and ( &#x27;a musical pitch&#x27;) phonetic—which is also seen in early forms of ( &#x27;vessel&#x27;, &#x27;hut&#x27;) and ( &#x27;captive&#x27;).

The Qing scholar Duan Yucai&#x27;s annotated &quot;Shuowen Jiezi Zhu&quot; () is particularly notable, and the most common edition still in use by students.

20th-century scholarship offered new understandings and accessibility. Ding Fubao collected all available &quot;Shuowen&quot; materials, clipped and arranged them in the original dictionary order, and photo-lithographically printed a colossal edition. Notable advances in &quot;Shuowen&quot; research have been made by Chinese and Western scholars like Ma Zonghuo () and Ma Xulun ().

<text>Ards (named after the Ards Peninsula) was a local government district in Northern Ireland with the status of borough. It was one of twenty-six districts formed on 1 October 1973, and had its headquarters in Newtownards. It was merged with neighbouring North Down on 1 May 2015 to form the new Borough of Ards and North Down. Other towns in the defunct Borough included Portaferry, Comber, and Donaghadee, and the population of the area was 78,078 according to the 2011 census.

Strangford Lough is at the heart of the area, and is the largest inlet in Ireland with internationally renowned wildlife. The Irish Sea coast stretches from Donaghadee to Portaferry. Mount Stewart, a National Trust property on the shore of Strangford Lough, is in the area, as well as Northern Ireland&#x27;s only aquarium, Exploris, in Portaferry and Grace Neill&#x27;s pub in Donaghadee.

==Borough council==
The borough was governed by Ards Borough Council (Ulster-Scots: &quot;Burgh Cooncil o&#x27; the Airds, Newton an&#x27; Blathewick&quot;). The borough was divided into four district electoral areas: Newtownards, Ards West, Ards East and Ards Peninsula, from which 23 members were elected. As of February 2011 the following parties were represented on the council: 11 Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), 6 Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), 4 Alliance Party, and 1 Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), and there was 1 Independent councillor. The next election was due to take place in May 2009, but on 25 April 2008, Shaun Woodward, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland announced that the scheduled 2009 district council elections were to be postponed until the introduction of the eleven new councils in 2011. The proposed reforms were abandoned in 2010, and district council elections took place in 2011

===Mayor of Ards===
On creation in 1973 Ards District Council adopted the charter of incorporation of the municipal borough of Newtownards, to become Ards Borough Council. The charter also granted the chairman of the council the title &quot;Mayor of Ards&quot;.

==Parliamentary and assembly representation==

In elections for the Westminster Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly most of the borough was included in the Strangford constituency, with part (Donaghadee North, Donaghadee South and Millisle) in the North Down constituency.

==Town twinning==
The borough of Ards had a sister city (twinning) relationship with the city of Peoria, Arizona, USA. As a result of this relationship, regular exchange visits were made between the two communities by artists, educators, business, political and community leaders.

<text>The Irish calendar is the Gregorian calendar as it is in use in Ireland, but also incorporating Irish cultural festivals and views of the division of the seasons, presumably inherited from earlier Celtic calendar traditions.

*Winter () - November, December, January ()
*Spring () - February, March, April (, then )
*Summer () - May, June, July ()
*Autumn ( ) - August, September, October ()
The traditional Irish Calendar uses Astronomical Timing, however Meteorological Timing is also used by organisations such as the Met Éireann. Both are in use in the Republic of Ireland, however generally the Astronomical Calendar is the most commonly used.

In English-language Julian calendars and its derivatives, the months are based on names from Classical mythology, such as the name &quot;February&quot; which derives from the Roman purification rite, Februa. In the Irish calendar, the names of the months in the Irish language refer to Celtic religion and mythology, and generally predate the arrival of Christianity. The words for May (), August () and November (), are the names of Gaelic religious festivals. In addition, the names for September () and October () translate directly as &quot;middle of harvest&quot; and &quot;end of harvest&quot;. Christianity has also left its mark on the Irish months: the name for December () derives from Latin , referring to the birth of Christ.

==Names of the days==

Historical texts suggest that, during Ireland&#x27;s Gaelic era, the day began and ended at sunset. Through contact with the Romans, the seven-day week was borrowed by continental Celts, and then spread to the people of Ireland. In Irish, four days of the week have names derived from Latin, while the other three relate to the fasting done by early Gaelic Christians.

<doc id="473888" wikidata="Q3591470" url="?curid=473888" title="1985 United States–Canada tornado outbreak">
<text>The 1985 United States–Canada tornado outbreak, referred to as the Barrie tornado outbreak in Canada, was a major tornado outbreak that occurred in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and Ontario, on May 31, 1985. In all 44 tornadoes were counted including 14 in Ontario, Canada. It is the largest and most intense tornado outbreak ever to hit this region, and the worst tornado outbreak in Pennsylvania history in terms of deaths and destruction.

==Meteorological synopsis==

The upper air pattern was conducive for a major severe weather event in the Great Lakes that Friday, May 31. An unseasonably deep low-pressure system at 984 hPa crossed out of the Midwestern U.S. through the day, and then into the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Very warm air surged in ahead of this system. Temperatures reached the upper twenties in Celsius (approximately 80–85 Fahrenheit) across much of southern Ontario, in addition to high dew point levels. An unstable atmosphere (surface based lifted indices around minus 6) was the byproduct of this. Directional wind shear was also present in the warm sector of the storm, in addition to high helicity values and a vorticity maximum approaching the lower lakes.

The situation was worsened by the presence of copious amounts of moisture, which would allow any storms that could form to become severe rather quickly. Also, this was supportive of the HP (high-precipitation) counterpart of the supercell thunderstorm (Verkaik, 1997). All of this added up to the distinct possibility of severe rotating storms which would be messy, hard to see, and extremely dangerous. What was needed now was a trigger, and that came in the form of a trailing cold front behind the low. Severe thunderstorms and isolated tornadoes had already raked parts of the Midwest U.S. (particularly in Iowa and Wisconsin) the day before on May 30, associated with this same cold front (Grazulis, 1990).

The day started off on an active note with the warm front moving northwards. A possible tornado was reported near Leamington, accompanied by golfball-size hail from widespread severe thunderstorm activity in southwestern Ontario. Following the warm frontal passage, skies cleared rapidly and temperatures quickly began to rise. The cold front began crossing Lake Huron towards the noon hour, and with it several thunderstorms developed shortly after 1:30pm EDT, with the northernmost cell soon becoming most dominant. Environment Canada issued a severe thunderstorm warning at 2:25pm for Bruce County (complementing the special weather statement issued early that morning). At around 2:50pm, an F2 tornado touched down briefly in the Lion&#x27;s Head area (north of Wiarton) before moving out over Georgian Bay and dissipating.
At daybreak on May 31, 1985, a strong area of low pressure was centered near Duluth, Minnesota. A cold front extended south from the low across the western Great Lakes and then through Illinois and Missouri. The low tracked across the northern Great Lakes during the afternoon, while the cold front progressed eastward across Indiana and western Ohio. By late afternoon, temperatures had reached 87 degrees at Cleveland, 82 degrees at Youngstown, and 85 degrees at Erie, Pennsylvania. At the same time, conditions in the upper atmosphere continued to become more favorable for an outbreak of severe weather. By early afternoon, thunderstorms developed in Ontario, Canada, just ahead of the cold front.

Despite a forecast for severe thunderstorms, though, the sun shone relentlessly for most of that Friday because of a fourth element: a stable air mass at about 2,000 feet above ground level, which served as a &quot;lid&quot; on the brew beneath. Then, at 2:50 p.m., the &quot;lid&quot; moved, and huge cumulonimbus clouds, anvil-topped thunderheads, appeared seemingly out of nowhere all along the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. The storms quickly grew into powerful tornadic supercells.

==Confirmed tornadoes==


===Newton Falls–Niles, Ohio/Wheatland–Hermitage, Pennsylvania===

This violent tornado began in eastern Ohio and tore directly through the towns of Niles, Ohio, and Wheatland, Pennsylvania, producing F5 damage at both locations. The tornado killed 18 people and injured 310, and was the most violent and deadly of the 44 recorded that day. Registering F5 on the Fujita scale, it remains the Easternmost recorded F5 in United States history, the only F5 in Pennsylvania history, the last F5 in Ohio to date, and was also the most violent tornado reported in the United States in 1985.

It first touched down in Ohio near the Ravenna Arsenal in Portage County around 6:30 PM EDT. Gathering strength, it moved quickly into Newton Falls in Trumbull County causing F3 to F4 damage through much of the town. While nearly 400 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed, no fatalities were recorded in Newton Falls, due to the storm-readiness of local authorities and its tornado siren. Additional homes were completely destroyed as the tornado struck the north side of Lordstown. Continuing east, the tornado reached F5 intensity as it tore through the north side of Niles. Hundreds of homes in the Niles area were destroyed, including several homes with anchor bolts that were swept away with the debris scattered downwind. The Niles Park Plaza shopping center was completely leveled and partially swept away at F5 intensity, with several of the fatalities occurring at that location. Steel girders were buckled at the shopping center, and a nearby retirement home and a skating rink were leveled as well. As the tornado struck an industrial area in Niles, large 30-foot tall metal petroleum storage tanks (each weighing 75,000 pounds) were torn from where they were anchored and thrown, some of which were tossed or bounced considerable distances. One of the tanks was found in the middle of a road, 60 yards from where it originated. The tornado weakened slightly as it tore through the north side of Hubbard and through the center of Coalburg, though many additional homes were still leveled in those areas.

As the tornado crossed the state line and reached Wheatland, Pennsylvania, it was a half-mile (0.8 km) wide and had regained F5 strength. A steel-frame trucking plant in Wheatland was obliterated and partially swept away at F5 intensity, as the building&#x27;s steel girder frame was mangled into a pile and pushed off of the foundation. At nearby Wheatland Sheet and Tube, sections of pavement were scoured from the parking lot, and shards of sheet metal and routing slips were left wedged beneath the remaining asphalt. Ninety-five percent of Wheatland&#x27;s business and residential area were destroyed. According to &quot;Storm Data&quot; from the National Weather Service, the destruction of the town &quot;resembled that of a bombed-out battle field.&quot; Continuing east, the tornado weakened slightly but remained violent as it struck Hermitage, damaging or destroying 71 homes along with the town&#x27;s airport, destroying several hangars and planes. A wing from one of the planes was found 10 miles away in Mercer. Another trucking steel processing plant was heavily damaged in Hermitage as well. The tornado then destroyed 15 homes and damaged 30 others in the Greenfield area before finally dissipating.

In Ohio, it was the deadliest tornado since the Xenia F5 during the Super Outbreak of April 3, 1974. The tornado was also captured on camera by several residents.
==Storm timeline and aftermath==
The outbreak lasted roughly from just before 2 p.m. EDT, when the first tornado touched down in Wiarton, Ontario, until just after 12 a.m. EDT when the last reported tornado struck Tobyhanna, Pennsylvania. The peak of the outbreak took place during the early evening hours where the strongest and deadliest tornadoes formed across western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio.

The first of two F4 tornadoes to affect Erie County touched down just west of the Pennsylvania state line around 5 p.m. The tornado moved across the northwestern tip of Crawford County and then entered Erie County near Pennside. After causing considerable damage there, the tornado slammed into Albion leveling the town. A ten-block area was completely destroyed, with nine people being killed. The tornado killed three more people in Cranesville before lifting. There were also 82 injuries, and a total of 309 destroyed buildings. The second F4 to affect Erie County touched down between Wattsburg and Corry in eastern Erie County. It clipped the northwestern tip of Warren County, before crossing into New York, where it did some damage in Chautauqua County, before dissipating near Panama. The tornado stayed on the ground for , but resulted in no fatalities.

The most famous tornado of this outbreak touched down in Portage County, Ohio, near the Ravenna National Guard Armory at about 6:30 p.m. and cut a path through Newton Falls, Niles, and Hubbard, Ohio, before entering Pennsylvania. This was the only F5 in the United States in 1985, and the deadliest Ohio tornado since the Xenia F5 during the 1974 Super Outbreak.

The outbreak took the lives of 90 people in the United States and Canada, the highest number of fatalities for an outbreak since the 1974 Super Outbreak and a mark that stood until the 2011 Super Outbreak.

===Other U.S. tornadoes===
Described as &quot;one of the most impressive tornadic events of the 20th century&quot; by meteorologist and researcher Thomas Grazulis, a massive, high-end F4 tornado tracked for through dense forest in central Pennsylvania. Near the beginning of its path, a few homes were heavily damaged and some outbuildings were destroyed, but otherwise, the tornado passed entirely through uninhabited areas in the Moshannon and Sproul State Forests. Surveyors estimated the damage path to be &quot;at least&quot; two and a half miles wide, with more than 90,000 trees obliterated. The tornado also generated tremors that set off local seismometers, and even the primitive WSR-57 weather radar in State College picked up a distinct reflectivity spike (also known as a &quot;debris ball&quot;), due to the large amount of trees and other vegetation being uprooted and lifted into the air as the tornado passed through the forest north of Interstate 80.

The second-deadliest tornado in Pennsylvania history touched down in Trumbull County, Ohio, just yards away from the Pennsylvania state line, and tracked for 56 miles through northwestern Pennsylvania. Rated F4, the tornado struck Jamestown in northwestern Mercer County, Atlantic and Cochranton in southern Crawford County, and Cooperstown in northern Venango County, narrowly missing Oil City to the north before dissipating south of Tionesta in western Forest County.

One deadly tornado impacted the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Rated F3, the tornado tracked for 39 miles through northern Beaver County and southern Butler County in southwestern Pennsylvania, approximately 20 miles north of Pittsburgh, narrowly missing the northernmost suburbs of the city. In Big Beaver, two people were killed when the Big Beaver Plaza was destroyed, along with more than 100 vehicles in the parking lot. Across the Beaver River from the shopping plaza, 16 antique vehicles were destroyed in a garage on River Road. Despite being rebuilt in 1987, business never recovered at the shopping plaza, which sits vacant today. In North Sewickley Township, the tornado struck the junction of PA 65 and PA 588, destroying the Spotlight 88 Drive-In Theater, a gas station, three homes and two other businesses. The drive-in theater was never rebuilt, and the site is used as Spotlight 88 Flea Market today. In Butler County, the tornado crossed Interstate 79, where it blew a southbound van a quarter of a mile off the highway. The family of four inside the van was ejected, but survived. A trailer park near Evans City was destroyed, as was another trailer on Water Station Road, where two people were killed. Near Callery, 40 homes were destroyed. People in the area reported pieces of sheet metal and shreds of pink insulation falling from the sky shortly before the tornado arrived. Near the end of its path, the tornado killed a babysitter and a young girl near Saxonburg, before dissipating near Sarver. In all, this tornado killed nine people, injured 120, and caused more than $10,000,000 of damage in Beaver County.

Three tornadoes were reported in New York: two in Chautauqua County, and one in St. Lawrence County. The first tornado, rated F4, crossed into New York from Erie County, Pennsylvania, and tracked for 28 miles (16 in Pennsylvania, 12 in New York), striking Clymer and Harmony in southwestern Chautauqua County before dissipating. The second tornado, rated F3, touched down in southeastern Chautauqua County and tracked for 13 miles, striking Kiantone, Carroll and Poland, and narrowly missing Jamestown to the east. The third tornado, rated F1, touched down in northern St. Lawrence County, and was produced by a supercell that crossed into the North Country from Ontario. This tornado tracked for five miles, passing north of Norfolk.

In all, 65 people were killed in Pennsylvania, which remains the highest death toll in a tornado outbreak in Pennsylvania history.

== Canada ==
Most of the tornadic activity at this point moved into southern Ontario producing more tornadoes (some of which were significant). These tornadoes formed around the Highway 7 corridor between Lindsay to Madoc (Joe and Leduc, 1993) near the towns of Wagner Lake (F1 at 5:40pm), Reaboro (F1 at 6:05pm), Ida (F2 at 6:20pm), Rice Lake (F3 at 6:25pm), and Minto (F1 at 6:35pm). Most of these tornadoes had conversely shorter paths than the earlier tornadoes, likely as a result of the parent thunderstorms beginning to weaken. In addition, they did not receive as much media attention as the previous tornadoes (those earlier storms were grouped collectively by the media as comprising &quot;The Barrie Tornado&quot;), probably a result of the fact that they didn&#x27;t have the opportunity to cause as much damage.

Even so, at the time these more eastern tornadoes were touching down, a final, more isolated supercell developed near Milverton in eastern Perth County which spawned a tornado at 6:15 pm. On the ground for approximately fifteen minutes, this tornado tracked a path of sporadic F3 damage (mainly to outbuildings) from Alma east-northeast towards the Hillsburgh area. Its path was almost parallel to the Grand Valley/Tottenham tornado only a couple of hours earlier.

===The Hopeville to Barrie supercell===
At about the same time the Lion&#x27;s Head tornado dissipated, two very severe thunderstorms had developed (that likely owed their inception, at least partially, to lake breeze convergence): one to the east of Clinton and another farther to the north, in the Walkerton area. These two developing supercells would grow into a pair of devastating storms within the next hour—likely the most prolific tornado producers in Canadian history to date.

The second tornado of the day touched down south of Hopeville around 3:45pm, causing some localized F3 damage along its track. This tornado lifted after a path, but another tornado quickly formed just north of Corbetton, in northern Dufferin County, at about 4:15pm. It stayed over rural areas for most of its path, however a few homes (especially in the Terra Nova and Mansfield area) sustained F3 damage. It has been disputed whether this path was of two separate tornadoes or just one. Shortly after this tornado dissipated, there were hints of another brief touchdown near Angus in the Blackdown Park training area of Canadian Forces Base Borden (north of Alliston). The next tornado was the last of this storm, but was the most infamous one. It formed in southern Simcoe County (Essa Township), less than southwest of Highway 400 and the Barrie city limits.

At approximately 4:00pm, all electrical power in Barrie went out, as the Grand Valley/Tottenham tornado took out the main hydro transformers, southwest of the city (LeGrand, 1990). Few residents were aware of the tornado, but many people were let off work 30–45 minutes before the storm hit due to these power outages. Had this not happened, the death toll would have been higher. The intensifying tornado first obliterated a pine tree forest plantation. Some high trees were snapped at the level. At this point the damage path was about wide, moving steadily towards the east-northeast. It then entered the southern part of Barrie shortly before 5:00 pm. Visibility was very low as the tornado was cloaked in heavy rain and dust. Extensive F3 and localized F4 damage occurred to an entire square block of homes in the Crawford Street and Patterson Road subdivision. Five people were killed in the area as some homes there were not well-built, and thus collapsed after being pushed off their foundations. Most of the fatalities occurred in homes with no basements, where head and chest trauma resulted from an increased exposure to flying debris.

Next, the tornado hit an industrial complex (known then as Molson Park). One person died at a tire retreading facility while at least fifteen other businesses were damaged or destroyed (Bruineman, 2010). Steel I-beams were twisted out of shape, and splinters of wood were found embedded into nearby concrete walls. The tornado then proceeded to cross Highway 400 at Essa Road (former Highway 27) interchange, just missing the Barrie Racetrack to the south. The grandstand was heavily damaged and several barns nearby were destroyed. A man was killed after he was sucked out of his parked car in an adjacent lot (Bruineman, 2010). Several vehicles traveling on Highway 400 were tossed into the ditch, their drivers escaping with only minor injuries. Highway guard rails were found wrapped around telephone poles nearby. Many cars were also found with puncture holes in their frames, owing to the flying debris. As the tornado crossed the highway, it moved into the Allandale subdivision.

Many homes sustained severe damage there, with much of their upper floors missing. By this time the tornado&#x27;s path had narrowed to about . The track moved from Debra Crescent to Joanne Court with more extensive damage. Near Tower Crescent, the path narrowed to a comparatively small . On Briar Road, homes sustained only minor damage, indicating that the tornado had weakened, but the next road east, Trillium Crescent, sustained heavy damage indicating that it had strengthened once again. Four warehouses near Highway 11 were ripped apart. It then hit the Tollendal Woods and Minets Point area, taking out the Brentwood Marina and a nearby subdivision. A boy was killed in this area while trying to bicycle home (Bruineman, 2010). More than thirty boats, accompanied by their concrete moorings, were tossed into Lake Simcoe and never to be recovered. The tornado then moved out over Kempenfelt Bay where it became a waterspout for a brief time before weakening out completely. It came very close to the opposite shore, but no damage was reported there. Large quantities of debris from the city were later found floating in the bay, however. Despite the tornado&#x27;s relatively short path length (under ), eight people died in Barrie with 155 injured, and as many as 300 homes were damaged or destroyed.
===The Grand Valley to Tottenham supercell===

The storm which had initially developed east of Clinton produced a new tornado a couple kilometres north of Arthur by 4:15 pm. Many power lines and hydro towers were destroyed early in its lifetime (including those used to deliver electricity from the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station to northern and western parts of the Greater Toronto Area). The tornado quickly widened, intensified and reached violent proportions by the time it reached the small crossroads community of Grand Valley just before 4:30pm. At that point the tornado&#x27;s damage path was approximately wide.

The tornado caused major damage in the small town, where two people were killed. An elderly woman visiting from Scotland died as the home was destroyed, and a man was killed in his pickup truck on a nearby farm (Bruineman, 2010). The worst damage was found along Amaranth Street (running west to east, parallel to the tornado&#x27;s path) where the local library, three churches, and many other homes were severely damaged or destroyed. Approximately sixty structures in total sustained damage. The most severe was on the north side of the street, where some homes exhibited classic F4 damage. The library roof was found some 200 metres away on a nearby house (Bruineman, 2010).

Continuing eastward through more open country, it brushed the northern outskirts of Orangeville about fifteen minutes later (Grazulis, 2001) where the southern portion of the Mono Shopping Plaza completely collapsed (injuring 67 people, one of them seriously). It then caused extensive damage to approximately fifty buildings (many of which were only recently built) about south of the town of Tottenham at around 5:00 pm. Two more people died here, as an elderly man was crushed under an equipment shed on his farm and a woman was killed in her home (Bruineman, 2010). The tornado continued moving to the east-northeast, crossing Highway 400 into York region. It just missed the cities of Newmarket and Bradford before lifting west of Mount Albert at 5:25pm, with a path length in excess of , thus becoming a Canadian record that still stands today. When the earliest tornado track maps were published within the next year, they showed this particular tornado to have tracked almost twice as far towards the Peterborough area before dissipating. In more recent years this theory has proved to be incorrect; it is likely that this supercell was also a cyclic one.
==Aftermath==
Following the event, ninety people were dead and 281 were injured, as close to a thousand businesses and homes were wiped out (Grazulis, 2001). Still, hundreds more were left out of work largely as a result of the massive damage sustained to the industrial complex in Barrie. Of the 605 homes in the path of these tornadoes, approximately one-third were rendered uninhabitable. One of the more sobering instances was that of a blind Orangeville-area man whose home suffered a similar fate, following a painstaking 20 years of construction (LeGrand, 1990). Nevertheless, in the hours following the event, soldiers from &quot;B&quot; and &quot;F&quot; Companies, The Grey and Simcoe Foresters and from Canadian Forces Base in Borden assembled in Barrie to assist in the canvassing of the worst affected areas of the city. Coincidentally, the latter had barely escaped a tornado itself that day, it having momentarily touched down in the Blackdown Park Training Area before lifting again and passing over hundreds of married quarters. In addition, the Grand Valley library (levelled by an F4 tornado) donated books, and wooden pallets were donated by a local trucking company in Barrie so survivors could salvage their possessions.

Most of Grand Valley was completely rebuilt by August 1986, a little over a year later. The textile plant, Albarrie (one of twelve factories completely destroyed by the Barrie tornado) opened its doors once again within the next year. Even so, to this day there are still hints from the past of the tornadoes that day. Some of the wooded areas affected are still a twisted mess, and some random debris still remains scattered in the bush to the east of Highway 400 in Barrie. In the end, the price tag from the severe weather in Ontario alone reached an estimated $200 million (in unadjusted Canadian dollars, 1985). Correlating to nearly $390 million in Canadian dollars by today&#x27;s standard, it was a very expensive disaster indeed (LeGrand, 1990). This tornado outbreak ranks among the Southern Ontario tornado outbreak of 2005 and the 1998 Ice Storm as one of the most costly weather disasters to strike Ontario. Climatologists have estimated that the probability of a severe weather outbreak as widespread and catastrophic as this one, occurring this far north and east in North America once again is one in 75,000 (Grazulis, 2001).

On the evening of May 31, 1985, an F1 tornado touched down far to the east of the other twisters from that day at around 8:10 p.m., near Grippen Lake, about 35 kilometres northeast of Kingston, Ontario. This makes it a &quot;14th lost and found tornado&quot;.

<text>Ballymoney was a local government district with borough status in Northern Ireland. It was headquartered in Ballymoney. Other towns in the borough included Dervock, Dunloy, Cloughmills and Rasharkin. The borough had a population of 31,224 according to the 2011 census.

In May 2015 it was merged with the boroughs of Coleraine and Limavady and the District of Moyle to form the Causeway Coast and Glens district.

==Creation==
Ballymoney was one of twenty-six districts created on 1 October 1973. It took over the areas Ballymoney Urban District Council and most of the surrounding Ballymoney Rural District in County Antrim.

==Borough council==
The borough was divided into three electoral areas which between them returned 16 members. These were Ballymoney Town (5), Bann Valley (6) and Bushvale (5). Elections were conducted under the proportional representation single transferable vote system, and elections of the whole council were normally held every four years. The election due to take place in May 2009 was postponed in anticipation of the creation of eleven new councils in 2011. The proposed reforms were abandoned in 2010, and the most recent district council elections took place in 2011

As of February 2012 the political composition of the last council was: 8 Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), 3 Sinn Féin, 2 Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), 1 Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), 1 Traditional Unionist Voice and 1 independent.

In 1977 Ballymoney District Council successfully petitioned for a grant of a charter of incorporation, constituting the district a borough.

===Mayor of Ballymoney===
The charter also created the office of mayor, who was chosen for a one-year term at the council&#x27;s annual meeting.

==Freedom of the Borough==
On 22 February 1997 The Ballymoney Branch of the Royal British Legion was awarded the Freedom of the Borough.
In 2012 the Royal Irish Regiment and 152 (Ulster) Transport Regiment, The Royal Logistic Corps (Volunteers) were awarded the freedom of Ballymoney by the council. On both occasions the regiments held special marches through the town to celebrate the awards. Previous recipients include the Royal Ulster Constabulary (Both Regular and Reserve Forces), Northern Ireland Fire Brigade, Joey Dunlop, his brother Robert and the former MP for the area Ian Paisley.

==Town twinning==
In 2000, Ballymoney Borough Council twinned with the French town of Vanves. Since 2001, the council has been a sister city of Benbrook in Texas and building on its motorcycling history, is also linked to the borough of Douglas, Isle of Man.

==Parliamentary and assembly representation==
Together with the neighbouring districts of Ballymena and Moyle, it forms the North Antrim constituency for elections to the Westminster Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly.

Former Councillors that went on to become MLAs included Philip McGuigan Mervyn Storey and Daithi McKay.

==Demographics==
The borough has the highest life expectancy of any area in Northern Ireland, with the average male life expectancy at birth being 79.0 years and 82.6 years for females.

<doc id="473891" wikidata="Q4649389" url="?curid=473891" title="A49 road">
<text>The A49 is an A road in western England, which traverses the Welsh Marches region. It runs north from Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire via Hereford, Leominster, Ludlow, Shrewsbury and Whitchurch, then continues through central Cheshire to Warrington and Wigan before terminating at its junction with the A6 road just south of Bamber Bridge, near the junction of the M6, M65 and M61 motorways.

As is hinted at by the way the place name of &quot;Stretton&quot; recurs along its route, its central part follows Iter XII of the Roman Antonine Itinerary.

The stretch between Ross-on-Wye and the A5 at Shrewsbury is a trunk road, maintained by National Highways.

==Route==
===Lancashire===

From the A6 at Bamber Bridge, south of Preston, the road runs parallel to the M6 motorway, through Leyland towards Wigan. Through Ashton-in-Makerfield and Newton-le-Willows, reaching Warrington via Winwick. In June 2020, a new section of the A49 opened forming part of a link between Wigan town centre and junction 25 on the M6, the section it replaced being renumbered B5386.

===Cheshire===

From junction 9 of the M62, there is a dual-carriageway through Warrington, as far as Loushers Lane (With the exception of a brief stretch northbound after meeting the A57 and another northbound before meeting the A5060 which has one lane reserved for buses during peak hours.). During this section, it passes under the Liverpool to Manchester Line railway (southern route), then has the &quot;Cockhedge Green&quot; roundabout with the A57 and passes to the east and south of the town centre of Warrington. (Its original north–south route through the town centre is now partly pedestrianised.)

It passes over a roundabout with the A5061 situated on the River Mersey, then goes past Priestley College. It passes over the Manchester Ship Canal, Cheshire Ring Canal Walk and Bridgewater Canal. At Pewterspear there is the &quot;Owens Corner&quot; roundabout. The road has crossroads with the B5356 at Stretton and meets the A559 at junction 10 of the M56. The road enters Cheshire West And Chester. There is crossroads with the A533 and the road crosses the Cheshire Ring Canal Walk and Trent &amp; Mersey Canal before crossing the Acton swing bridge over the Weaver Navigation.
The £6 million Weaverham Diversion (near Northwich) opened in September 1992. The old route is now the B5144, passing near Weaverham High School. The road passes over the West Coast Main Line railway after the &quot;Weaverham Roundabout&quot;. The section from Weaverham to Cuddington is a new much-straightened section. At Bryn, north of Cuddington, it passes the former site of Lactalis-Nestlé that made Ski and Munch Bunch yoghurts, closing in 2007 with production moving to central Europe, having made yoghurt since 1968. In Cuddington it crosses the Mid-Cheshire Line near Cuddington railway station. There is the &quot;Oakmere Crossroads&quot; with the A556 (a Roman road) south of Cuddington, before the road crosses the Whitegate Way. It then crosses the A54 near Abbots Moss Hall, and the road passes through Cotebrook, near Little Budworth Country Park.
The £3.8 million Tarporley Bypass opened in September 1986. The A51 overlaps the A49. Tarporley Community High School is near here. The road leaves the A51 to the west at &quot;Four Lane Ends&quot; near the &quot;Red Fox&quot;. The road travels over the Shropshire Union Canal and under the Welsh Marches Line railway (to Hereford) south of Tiverton. It crosses over the River Gowy north of Bunbury next to the &quot;Beeston Castle&quot; (named after the real Beeston Castle to the west).

The road briefly overlaps the A534 &quot;Wrexham Road&quot; from the junction at Ridley and crosses over the River Weaver. At Cholmondeley there is Cholmondeley Castle. At the crossroads of &quot;Bickerton Road&quot; (for the castle) and &quot;Wrenbury Road&quot;, there is the &quot;Cholmondeley Arms&quot;. Moving from the parishes of Cholmondeley to Bickley east of Moss Wood, it also moves back into Cheshire West and Chester. It crosses the Shropshire Union Canal (Llangollen Canal) again at Tushingham cum Grindley, where it crosses into Marbury cum Quoisley and back into Cheshire East. The road enters into Shropshire and is crossed by the South Cheshire Way near Hinton.

===Shropshire===
The Whitchurch bypass begins with a roundabout with the B5476, the old route through the town. The £13.7m Whitchurch Bypass (also part of the A41) opened in July 1992. It passes near Sir John Talbot&#x27;s Technology College (on the A525), then crosses over the railway and also overlaps the A525 (Newcastle-under-Lyme to Rhyl). At the end of the bypass, the road overlaps as a dual-carriageway for with the A41, then leaves the A41 at a roundabout near Prees Heath, near the former RAF Tilstock airfield. It follows a Roman road southwards.
The £1.3m Prees Bypass opened in August 1988. There is a staggered crossroads with the B5065, then the road passes over the River Roden. RAF Shawbury is to the east, then the road passes over the Shropshire Way and through Hadnall, passing the &quot;New Inn&quot;. The Welsh Marches Line follows to the west. The Shrewsbury bypass starts at the &quot;Battlefield Roundabout&quot; (near scene of Battle of Shrewsbury) with the A53 and A5124, near a Travelodge. There is a roundabout with the B5062. The bypass travels over the River Severn and under the railway and overlaps the A5 from the &quot;Preston Island&quot; roundabout. Shrewsbury was bypassed when the £64m east-west A5 bypass was built in August 1992.
The route leaves the A5 at the &quot;Bayston Hill Roundabout&quot; on the south of the bypass, with the A5112 heading into Shrewsbury. It goes through Bayston Hill, passing the &quot;Compasses Inn&quot;. It passes near Lyth Hill Country Park, following the Welsh Marches Line (until Woofferton). It crosses the Cound Brook near the &quot;Bridge Inn&quot;before passing through Dorrington, with &quot;The Horseshoes&quot; and over the railway. Through Leebotwood it passes &quot;The Pound&quot;.

The road passes through the Stretton Gap on an alignment that was constructed in the late 1930s. Several stretches of the road follow the route of one of the Roman Roads later called Watling Street. The upgraded route bypasses All Stretton, Church Stretton and Little Stretton. The original route is the B5477 (former B4370) to the west. At a crossroads near Church Stretton railway station, the road meets the B4371. Further south it meets the B4370 (west) at Marshbrook. At Upper Affcot it passes the &quot;White House&quot;. The road meets the A489 at Wistanstow. At Craven Arms, there is the Shropshire Hills Discovery Centre, and it meets the east-west B4368. At Onibury, there is a level crossing, one of only a few on trunk roads in England. The section from Shrewsbury to Ludlow is prone to crashes.

At Bromfield, the road meets the A4113, and crosses the River Onny. Near the B4365 junction the road is crossed by the Shropshire Way. The £4m Ludlow Bypass opened in the summer of 1979. The bypass passes over then under the railway, then over the River Teme. The former route of the A49 is the B4361. After the bypass, the road passes over the railway. At Woofferton, there is a T-junction with the A456, and a staggered junction with the B4362. Woofferton has a large radio transmitting station (the Woofferton transmitting station) with a Mediumwave transmitter for BBC Hereford and Worcester.

===Herefordshire===

The road enters Herefordshire. The £1.4 million Brimfield Bypass opened in March 1983. South of Ashton the road passes through the Capability Brown parkland of Berrington Hall. The £9m Leominster Bypass opened in November 1988. At the southern end of the Leominster Bypass the A49 passes the Cadbury&#x27;s Marlbrook chocolate factory. Shortly after, the A417 route to Gloucester begins at a junction shortly before the A49 makes its way up Dinmore Hill past Queen&#x27;s Wood Country Park. The south bound carriageway is 2-lane up the hill and the north bound carriageway is 2-lane heading up the other side of the hill. This can be a common section for accidents and skid-offs.

The road then swings towards Wellington with a short section of dual-carriageway. The A49 then reaches Hereford, the only major destination on the road without a bypass. The road passes right through the city centre, causing serious congestion on both the north and south sides of the River Wye. The dual-carriageway Greyfriars bridge over the Wye opened in 1967. The A49 meets the A438 at the &quot;Edgar Street Roundabout&quot;. The road then swings south-eastwards out of Hereford, meeting the A465 at the &quot;Belmont Roundabout&quot;. At Ross-on-Wye the road ends, joining the A40 and B4260 at the &quot;Wilton Roundabout&quot;.

==History of the road number==
The original (1923) route of the A49 was Ross-on-Wye to Bamber Bridge (near Preston), but there have been some changes in its course. The A49 used to start on the A40 at Old Pike, west of Ross, as the original route of the A40 was through Skenfrith. When the A40 was rerouted via Monmouth in 1935, the A49 was extended to Ross.

At a later date, the A49 was rerouted between Shrewsbury and Whitchurch. The 1923 route was via Wem, but the road now passes close to Prees. Much of the current route was originally the B5064.

<doc id="473903" wikidata="Q738476" url="?curid=473903" title="Susumu Terajima">
<text>is a Japanese actor. Though he has played a wide range of characters, he is perhaps best known for his portrayal of &quot;yakuza&quot; figures, most notably in the films of Takeshi Kitano.

Terajima made his acting debut in 1986&#x27;s &quot;A Homansu&quot;. He joined Japan Music Entertainment in December 2018.

==Early life==
Terajima was born in Fukagawa, downtown of Tokyo. He is the second son of three and his father was a tatami craftsman. His childhood memory was when he and his mother walking to kindergarten together and his teacher called him &quot;mu-chan&quot; because of his cute face. Terajima&#x27;s interest in acting began when he watched an action-comedy movie, Truck Yarou. He also loved to sing, impersonating members of the pop duo Pink Lady with his friends.
After graduating from high school, to pursue his dream of becoming an actor, he enrolled at Mifune Art Academy to continue his education, although his parents did not agree with his decision as they wanted him to continue working in the family business. During those years, Terajima did many side jobs, including work as a stuntman, until he met Yusaku Matsuda, who directed A Homansu and gave Terajima a minor role in the movie.

==Career==
Terajima played a supporting role in Violent Cop (1989), where he met his respectful mentor, Takeshi Kitano. His breakthrough as an actor was in Kitano&#x27;s Sonatine. After the success of Sonatine, Terajima went on to enjoy a successful career playing various roles in television and film, usually in a supporting position, but occasionally as the lead character, such as in Hirokazu Kore-eda&#x27;s After Life and Sabu&#x27;s The Blessing Bell (2002).

== Posterity ==
Notable composers who have been influenced by them include:
* Benjamin Britten, particularly in the Sonata in C for Cello and Piano
* Elliott Carter, who refers in the opening of his own First String Quartet to Bartók&#x27;s Sixth Quartet
* Chen Yi
* Edison Denisov, whose Second Quartet is closely related to Bartók&#x27;s Fifth Quartet
* Franco Donatoni, who was deeply impressed when he heard a broadcast of Bartók&#x27;s Fourth Quartet
* Robert Fripp, who mentions them as an influence on the band King Crimson
* Miloslav Ištvan
* György Kurtág, whose Opp. 1 and 28 both owe a great deal to Bartók&#x27;s quartets
* György Ligeti, whose two string quartets both owe a great deal to Bartók&#x27;s quartets
* Bruno Maderna
* George Perle, who credits the Bartók Fourth and Fifth Quartets as precedents for his use of arrays of chords related to one another by different types of symmetry
* Walter Piston
* Steve Reich, who described them in an interview as &quot;the greatest set of quartets since Beethoven&quot;
* Kim Dzmitrïyevich Tsesakow
* Stefan Wolpe, who explained in a public lecture how he had derived ideas from Bartók&#x27;s Fourth Quartet
* Xu Yongsan
* Jouni Kaipainen, credited openly Bartók&#x27;s quartets as his model.

<text>Amateur television (ATV) is the transmission of broadcast quality video and audio over the wide range of frequencies of radio waves allocated for radio amateur (Ham) use. ATV is used for non-commercial experimentation, pleasure, and public service events. Ham TV stations were on the air in many cities before commercial television stations came on the air. Various transmission standards are used, these include the broadcast transmission standards of NTSC in North America and Japan, and PAL or SECAM elsewhere, utilizing the full refresh rates of those standards. ATV includes the study of building of such transmitters and receivers, and the study of radio propagation of signals travelling between transmitting and receiving stations.

ATV is an extension of amateur radio. It is also called HAM TV or fast-scan TV (FSTV), as opposed to slow-scan television (SSTV).
==North America ==
In North America, amateur radio bands that are suitable for a television signal (wide enough to fit such a signal) are higher in frequency than VHF broadcast TV. The lowest frequency ham band suitable for television transmission is 70 centimeters, which is between broadcast channels 13 and 14. While outside of broadcast television channels, this frequency falls into CATV frequencies, on channels 57 to 61 (IRC) (420–450 MHz). As such, ATV transmissions can be viewed by setting a television or analog cable-box to cable input and attaching an outdoor antenna. For more sensitive reception, some users may use a purposely-built ATV down-converter, which is a kind of set-top-box. Other bands are also used for ATV, most of them in the UHF region on frequencies higher than UHF broadcast TV. 33 centimeters and 23 centimeters are two other commonly used bands for ATV, but reception of these higher bands requires the use of a down-converter.

Most ATV signals are transmitted in either amplitude modulation (AM) or vestigial sideband (VSB) NTSC (North American analog TV broadcast modulation standard). DSB AM and VSB AM signals are inherently compatible with each other, and most televisions can receive either. DSB-AM signals consists of the carrier and both upper and lower sidebands. VSB-AM is where DSB-AM is filtered and the lower sideband is highly attenuated at frequencies more than 1.25 MHz from the carrier signal. A VSB filter can be added to a DSB-AM transmitter to make it a VSB signal. The filters, depending on power usage, will cost anywhere from US$100–1,000. For practical reasons, most individual ATV users transmit in DSB-AM, and VSB is transmitted by repeater stations. On the 33 cm and higher bands, frequency modulation (FM) ATV may be used, and on the SHF and EHF ham bands, FM is more commonly used than VSB or AM. FM ATV is incompatible with AM/VSB ATV, and a separate demodulator, such as an analog satellite receiver, is necessary to receive signals.

===2 m band===
The 2-meter band (144-148 MHz) lies within cable channel 18, but at 4 MHz wide, it is too narrow to fit the full 6 MHz bandwidth of an NTSC analog channel; its audio carrier lies outside the band. To be used as a television frequency, some narrow-bandwidth format incompatible with most televisions must be used and converted.

The 2-meter band is often used by ATV operators for coordination with each other via FM voice transmissions. Operators seeking an ATV contact might first attempt calling on a regionally recognized ATV liaison-frequency, commonly 144.34 MHz, then agree to an ATV frequency to use for the video transmissions. The 2 meter frequency may be used throughout the contact to talk back to the current station transmitting video. The receiving station(s) may suggest adjustments the sending station can make, such as antenna direction, to improve the quality of the video received.

===70 cm band===
The 70-centimeter band (420-450 MHz) is the most commonly used ham band for ATV. Signals transmitted on this band usually propagate longer distances than on higher frequency bands, for a given transmitter power and antenna gain. The band falls between broadcast TV channels 13 and 14, which are 210–216 MHz and 470–476 MHz respectively. Propagation is similar to the lowest UHF TV broadcast channels.

Additionally, this band can be easily received by simply tuning any cable-ready analog television or cable-box to the cable TV channels below and connecting an outdoor TV antenna. Amateur TV signals are much weaker than broadcast TV, so a preamplifier is often used to improve reception.

Usage notes:
# In Canada and areas of the US north of a designated &quot;Line A&quot; boundary, amateurs are not allowed to transmit on these channels.
# Usually used as an ATV repeater output. VSB filters must be used on this channel to keep the signal inside the ham band.
# Channels 58 and 59 are often offset in frequency to limit interference to the weak-signal and amateur radio satellite sub-bands (431–433 &amp; 435–438 MHz respectively). Many modern CATV receivers can still lock-on to frequencies offset as much as 1 MHz.
# Rarely used today due to heavy FM repeater use in this range.
# To remain within the amateur radio bandwidth allocation, a maximum of two channels may be simultaneously used within a given geographic area, and the video carrier frequencies must be at least 12 MHz apart for the signals not to interfere with each other.
# May not be used within 160 kilometers of Joint Base Cape Cod to protect PAVE PAWS.

===33 cm band===
The 33-centimeter band (902-928 MHz) is next highest frequency ham band available for ATV in North America. This ham band is unique to ITU Region 2, and it is rarely available for amateur use in ITU Regions 1 or 3. This band is also shared with many users, including ISM devices and unlicensed Part 15 users, so interference issues are more likely than on other bands.

These channels can be received by many newer analog cable-boxes and televisions, which can tune to channels above 125.

Usage notes:
# Available, but no known usage.
# In portions of Colorado and Wyoming, amateurs are not allowed to transmit ATV on this channel.
# May interfere with growing FM use on the 927–928 MHz sub-band.
# For technical reasons, a maximum of two channels may be simultaneously used within a given geographic area, and the video carrier frequencies must be at least 12 MHz apart for the signals not to interfere with each other.

Additionally 33 cm is the lowest frequency band on which higher-quality frequency modulated amateur TV occurs. This format gives better picture quality than standard AM television. The FM television format used is identical to big dish analog satellite television and can be received by some tuners which can tune this low in frequency. Otherwise a specialized FM amateur TV receiver is needed.

===23 cm band===
The 23-centimeter band (1.24-1.3 GHz) is the third-lowest frequency band available for ATV. Analog big-dish satellite television (TVRO) receivers may be re-purposed for inexpensively receiving ATV in this band. Such receivers can decode FM television when an outdoor antenna is connected to the LNB input. Due to the low cost and ease of repurposing old analog satellite receivers, this is the most popular band for FM amateur TV.

Commonly used 23 cm FM channels:
*1.255 GHz
*1.265 GHz

This band is also used for AM/VSB television, although this requires a specialized receiver.


Usage notes:
# VSB filters must be used on this channel to keep the signal inside the ham band.
# All of the video carrier frequencies are 12 MHz apart to allow for each channel to be used simultaneously in a given geographic area without causing interference to each other.
# Not available in certain New England states due to interference with the FAA&#x27;s surveillance radar at Cummington, Massachusetts.

===Other amateur radio bands===
In addition to the above, there are other ham bands which are less commonly used for ATV:

*On the 13-centimeter band:
**2.4175 GHz is used for ATV links.
**2.4415 GHz is the band&#x27;s most used FM ATV frequency. A 6.0 MHz audio sub-carrier and 4 MHz deviation are used.
*The 9 centimeter (3.4 GHz) and 5 centimeter (5.8 GHz) bands have ATV links in some areas.
*On the 3-centimeter band, 10.4 GHz is a wideband FM channel, and it may be used as an ATV repeater input.

===Other information===
The distance record for ATV is between Hawaii and California (2,518 miles) on 434 MHz.

Experiments with digital modes have lagged somewhat behind those in Europe, but have taken on some new urgency given the transition of broadcast television. WR8ATV currently has an output using DVB-S, which is believed to be the first DATV repeater in the US.

There is now a DATV downlink on the ISS operating in the amateur 2.4 GHz band. The QO-100 geostationary satellite wideband transponder has DATV uplinks in the 2.4 GHz and downlinks in 10 GHz amateur bands.

==Europe==
In Europe, which generally has a narrower 70 cm allocation than the USA, the majority of amateur television operation is currently frequency modulated on and above. The frequencies in use depend on national permissions. In most of mainland Europe, the most common frequency is 1.255 GHz. Other bands commonly used for ATV are the 13cm () and 3-cm () bands, although ATV is used on most of the microwave bands.

In several countries cross-band repeaters are used, with AM inputs on 430 MHz and FM outputs on , others have FM-ATV inputs on and outputs on .

In the United Kingdom, much activity occurs using in-band repeaters. These generally have an input of 1.248, 1.249 or 1.255 GHz and typically output at 1.308, 1.312 or 1.316 GHz, although other frequencies are also used. Simplex operation occurs on these or other frequencies chosen to avoid interference with other users of the band, e.g. . Recent experiments have been done with digital modes following widely adopted DVB-S and DVB-T standards. These new DATV transmissions need less spectrum bandwidth than FM-ATV and offer superior picture quality. However, the unavoidable processing delays caused by the temporal compression mean that DATV signals have a second or more of time lag, which can make real-time video conversations feel much less natural than the &#x27;instantaneous&#x27; analogue system.

==Transmission characteristics==

Typically frequency modulated TV is used on frequencies above 1.24 GHz (1,240 MHz), where there is enough bandwidth for such wideband transmissions. This is often used as a repeater&#x27;s input frequency, with output being standard VSB on the four channels listed above.

In a nutshell
* below 1.24 GHz: Vestigial Sideband
* above 1.24 GHz: FM, PSK etc...

The quality of transmission is expressed as a &quot;p level&quot;; &quot;p&quot; standing for &quot;picture&quot;. P levels range from zero to five, increasing as the picture becomes more viewable. P-0 signifies a state in which sync bars are visible, but the picture is too snowy to be seen; this occurs at a minimum signal strength of 3 dB. Each level represents an increase of 6 dB over the previous; P-5 is 30 dB above P-0 and represents a perfectly clear picture.

===Range===
As transmission frequency increases, atmospheric path losses become greater, particularly at frequencies above 10 GHz. Additionally, long-distance propagation by F-layer ionospheric skip over the horizon does not typically occur at higher frequencies, and terrain and man-made structures can affect propagation of signals, blocking or redirecting signals. Factors such as E-layer skip propagation, tropospheric enhancement, and knife-edge diffraction can extend the useful range of signals.

==Content==

Content produced by ATV has included:

*From 1968 to about 2004 amateur TV provided behind-the-scenes co-ordination for the annual New Year&#x27;s Day Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California.
*Ham TV (as it is also called) provides video co-ordination of many public service events and, along with traditional amateur radio, provides &quot;eyes&quot; in natural disasters.
*U.S. stations often retransmitted NASA TV while they were not in use, especially when there were Space Shuttle missions. NASA TV, as a work of the United States government, has no copyright and can be legally and freely retransmitted without permission, and has the advantage of not having to be manually programmed by the amateur station itself. In a similar vein, other public domain filler content can include television episodes and films with expired copyrights—especially silent films in scenarios where content without audio is needed—with the caveat that this content must be programmed.
*In recent history, amateur TV has found renewed interest in the radio-controlled hobby world as a method for transmitting FPV video, for use when flying remote control aircraft or piloting other RC vehicles.

<text>900 (nine hundred) is the natural number following 899 and preceding 901. It is the square of 30 and the sum of Euler&#x27;s totient function for the first 54 positive integers. In base 10, it is a Harshad number. It is also the first number to be the square of a sphenic number.

==In other fields==
900 is also:

* A telephone area code for &quot;premium&quot; telephone calls in the North American Numbering Plan (900 number)

<doc id="473916" wikidata="Q356776" url="?curid=473916" title="Monkey wrench">
<text>A monkey wrench is a type of smooth-jawed adjustable wrench, a 19th century American refinement of 18th-century English coach wrenches. It was widely used in the 19th and early 20th century. It is of interest as an antique among tool collectors and is still occasionally used in practice.

More broadly, a &quot;monkey wrench&quot; may be a pipe wrench or any other kind of adjustable wrench.

==Etymology and history==

Adjustable coach wrenches for the odd-sized nuts of wagon wheels were manufactured in England and exported to North America in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. They were set either by sliding a wedge, or later by twisting the handle, which turned a screw, narrowing or widening the jaws. In 1840, Loring Coes, a knife manufacturer in Worcester, Massachusetts, invented a screw-based coach wrench design in which the jaw width was set with a spinning ring fixed under the sliding lower jaw, above the handle. This was patented in 1841 and the tools were advertised and sold in the United States as &quot;monkey wrenches&quot;, a term which was already in use for the English handle-set coach wrenches. Published reports from 1834 and 1840 show the term in use (and indicating by the absence of explanatory glosses that the term was not unfamiliar). The origin of the name is not entirely clear, but Geesin (2015) reports that it originated in Britain with a fancied resemblance of the wrench&#x27;s jaws to that of a monkey&#x27;s face, and that the many convoluted folk etymologies that later developed were baseless. Before the Bahco/Johansson/Crescent type became widespread in the United States, during the industrial era of the 1860s to the 1910s, various monkey wrench types were the dominant form of adjustable wrench there. During that era, a very wide and popular range of monkey wrenches was manufactured by Coes family partnerships, licensees and companies, which filed further wrench patents throughout the 19th century. Some Coes wrenches could be bought with wooden knife handles, recalling the company&#x27;s earlier knives. In 1909, the Coes Wrench Company advertised a six-foot-long &quot;key&quot; wrench, shaped like a monkey wrench, for use on railroads. The Coes wrench designs were acquired by the toolmaker Bemis &amp; Call of Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1928. After 1939, its successor companies manufactured monkey wrenches from Coes designs until the mid-1960s, a production run of over 120 years.

In German Language the wrench is called &quot;Engländer&quot; which means &quot;Englishman&quot;. It is thought to be called so because it was useful for the less common imperial (&quot;English&quot;) screws and nuts in continental Europe when only metric open-end or ring wrenches were available.

Monkey wrenches are still manufactured and are used for some heavy tasks, but they have otherwise been mostly replaced by the shifting adjustable wrench/spanner, which is much lighter and has a smaller head, allowing it to fit more easily into tight spaces, and the tooth-jawed, torque-gripping pipe wrench.

==False etymologies==
===Charles Moncky myth===
The following story was widespread from the late 19th and early 20th centuries:

That handy tool, the &quot;monkey-wrench&quot;, is not so named because it is a handy thing to monkey with, or for any kindred reason. &quot;Monkey&quot; is not its name at all, Charles Moncky, the inventor of it, sold his patent for $5000, and invested the money in a house in Williamsburg, Kings County, where he now lives.
Although this story was refuted by historical and patent research in the late 19th century, it appears to have been inspired by a real person. A Charles Monk (not Moncky) lived in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn in the 1880s where he made and sold moulder&#x27;s tools, not mechanics&#x27; tools like a monkey wrench. He could not have invented or named the monkey wrench because he was born after the term first appeared in print.

===Racial slur myth===
A story on social media claims that the African-American boxer Jack Johnson invented the wrench while in prison, and the wrench was named &quot;monkey wrench&quot; as a racial slur. However, both the first patent for a monkey wrench and the name predate Johnson&#x27;s birth. Johnson did, however, receive a patent for improvements to it.

== Culture ==
The largely US idiom &quot;to throw a monkey wrench into (something)&quot; means to sabotage something, equivalent to the British English &quot;to throw a spanner in the works&quot;. A &quot;left handed monkey wrench&quot; is sometimes used as ironic humor, as monkey wrenches are ambidextrous.

Cpl. Adrian Shephard, protagonist of Gearbox Software&#x27;s and Valve Software&#x27;s Half-Life: Opposing Force, wields a monkey wrench as his primary melee weapon. Similarly, the Engineer class in Team Fortress 2, also published by Valve, uses a monkey wrench as his base melee weapon.

<text>The Third Section of His Imperial Majesty&#x27;s Own Chancellery (, or &quot;III otdeleniye sobstvennoy E.I.V. kantselyarii&quot; - in full: Третье отделение Собственной Его Императорского Величества канцелярии &quot;Tretye otdeleniye Sobstvennoy Yego Yimperatorskogo Velichestva kantselyarii&quot;, sometimes translated as Third Department) was a secret-police department set up in Imperial Russia. As a successor-organisation to the Tayny Prikaz of 1654 to 1676, to the of 1686 to 1801 and to the Specialty Chancellery, it effectively served as the Imperial régime&#x27;s secret police for much of its existence. The organization was relatively small. When founded in July 1826 by Emperor Nicholas I it included only sixteen investigators. Their number increased to forty in 1855.
The Third Section disbanded in 1880, replaced by the Police Department and by the Okhrana.

==Creation and purpose==
The Decembrist Revolt of December 14, 1825 shook Emperor Nicholas I&#x27;s (r. 1825-1855) confidence in his control and led him to desire an effective tool against sedition and revolution. Created by imperial decree on June 25, 1826, Emperor Nicholas’ thirtieth birthday, the Third Section was Nicholas’ personal police force. Although Nicholas gave Count Alexander Benckendorff, the first Head Controller of the Section, few specific instructions, the Emperor intended the Third Section to act as Russia&#x27;s “moral and political guardian.” Just as Russia had ambassadors to other nations keeping the Emperor apprised of political conditions abroad, Nicholas saw the officers of the Third Section, the Gendarmes, as domestic ambassadors who listened, if surreptitiously, to the political discussions of everyday Russians. As ambassadors and moral guardians, the Gendarmerie was ostensibly tasked with guiding Russians along the political path the Emperor desired; however, the Gendarmerie gradually became a counter-revolutionary force rather than a group of “moral physicians.” 

Count Alexander Benckendorff was the Head Controller of the Section from 1826. He was the person who tried to warn Alexander I of the Decembrist plot; thus Nicholas I saw him as perfect head of the secret force. He also served as Chief of Gendarmes, but the office of the Executive Director of the Third Section was not formally merged with Chief of Gendarmes until 1829.

==Tasks and responsibilities==
This list enumerates the functions of the Third Section as Emperor Nicholas I described to the Director of the Special Chancellery of the Ministry of Internal Affairs:

# All orders and announcements in all instances of the higher police.
# Information concerning the number of various sects and heretical religious groups existing within the state.
# Information concerning the distribution of counterfeit money, stamps, documents, etc., the investigation and further prosecution of which is to remain in the jurisdiction of the Ministries of Finance and Internal Affairs.
# Detailed information concerning all persons under police surveillance, as ordered.
# The exile and arrest of suspicious or dangerous persons.
# Economic and supervisory administration of all places of imprisonment in which state prisoners are kept.
# All orders and instructions with regard to foreigners living in Russia, travelling in the country, or leaving it.
# Information concerning all events, without exception.
# Statistical information relating to the police.

===Surveillance===
In the wake of the Decembrist Revolt, Emperor Nicholas wanted above all to know what his people were thinking about his regime and to remain apprised of any growing conspiracies in order to stop them before they caused potential unrest. Thus, the main task of the Third Section was surveillance. In 1836, a year with no foreign wars that might increase domestic sedition, the Third Section had 1,631 individuals under surveillance, 1,080 of those for political reasons; this included everything from monitoring the actions of potentially dangerous civilians to assigning Third Section agents to pose as officials inside Russian governmental agencies to surveil senior officers and statesmen. Anyone under the Emperor could be watched since the Third Section answered to Nicholas alone. At one point in the early 1850s, Third Section agents were even detailed to monitor every move of Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolaievich, Chief of Russia&#x27;s Navy and Nicholas’ second son. However, since the agents of the Third Section generally surveilled only powerful nobles or bureaucrats or those suspected of treasonous acts, the Section&#x27;s reports to Emperor Nicholas, which had been intended to keep the Emperor accurately informed, gave Nicholas an incomplete view of the general mood of his people.

===Censorship===
In addition to monitoring actions and oral speech, the Third Section also played an important role in censorship of printed works. Although the Ministry of Education created the censorship laws and did the busywork of searching for objectionable material, Ministry censors were instructed to inform the Third Section of authors who violated the regulations. However, rather than wait to surveil only authors who had violated the censorship regulations, Third Section agents preferred to surveil certain authors and then, once suspicious activity was spotted, reject that author&#x27;s material even if it had passed the censors. In 1832, the Third Section gained the ability to reject publishers or editors of new periodicals on moral grounds, effectively putting the section in control of new periodicals, which could be established only with the Emperor&#x27;s approval. In the early 1830s, the Section attempted to apply its mandate to be a moral guide to Russians by encouraging publications it deemed good for the Empire rather than just punishing the authors of damaging works. For example, when Mikhail Pogodin wrote an article supporting Russia&#x27;s historic right to Lithuania, the Third Section offered him a reward.

===Propaganda===
One practical project that the Third Section attempted as part of its duties as moral guardian of Russia was not only to inform the Emperor of the public&#x27;s opinion but also to try to influence that opinion in the Imperial regime&#x27;s favor, both in Russia and abroad. Indeed, one of Count Benckendorff&#x27;s first actions as Head Controller had been the creation and distribution in English, French, and German translations, of an account of the Decembrist Revolt that presented the Emperor&#x27;s actions in a positive light to western Europeans. The Third Section also employed Russians living abroad not only to keep the Section apprised of foreign politics but also to write responses to attacks on Russia published in the foreign press. Additionally, the Third Section used any publications under its direct control, like the Polish newspaper &quot;Tygodnik Peterburgski&quot; (Petersburg Weekly), to publish pro-Russian articles in other European nations. However little success the Third Section&#x27;s modest propaganda efforts met in foreign presses, it had even less success domestically: rather than print pro-Nicholas propaganda of its own to improve Russians’ opinions of the Emperor, the Third Section resorted to pushing even broader censorship of Russian periodicals, threatening in 1848 to punish publishers not only for running seditious articles but even if the publication&#x27;s “tone and tendency” was not positive enough. During the series of European revolutions of 1848, the Third Section forbade any Russian periodical from printing any article of news describing a European nation facing a revolution.

==Failures and dissolution==
While the Third Section served as the Tsar&#x27;s deputy for 55 years, the organization had its share of failures and administrative shortcomings. For its entire history, the Third Section&#x27;s surveillance had been imperfect; not only did the gendarmes often fail to surveil people who were actually plotting, in one case, they even allowed Sophia Perovsky, who later led the successful plot to assassinate Tsar Alexander II (r. 1855-1881), to escape from them at a railroad station. 

Although the Third Section was dissolved on August 8, 1880, nearly seven months before Tsar Alexander&#x27;s assassination on March 2, 1881, there were several assassinations and attempted assassinations which did occur under the Section&#x27;s watch. Gregory Goldenberg assassinated the Governor of Kharkov, Prince Dmitry Kropotkin, on February 9, 1879 under the Third Section&#x27;s eye. Even General Drenteln, the Head Controller of the Third Section, was nearly assassinated on March 13 of that same year. These failures aside, perhaps the most damaging to the Third Section&#x27;s reputation was its failure to stop, or even to detect, the six attempts to assassinate Tsar Alexander II, including the successful attempt in 1881. The first failed attempt on the Tsar&#x27;s life, by the nihilist Dmitry Karakozov on April 4, 1866, led Prince Dolgorukov, the head of the section, to resign out of shame for his and the Section&#x27;s failure to protect Alexander II. 

There was a second attempt on Alexander II&#x27;s life in Paris in 1867, but it was not until the third attempt, this time by the revolutionary Alexander Solovyov, on April 2, 1879, that the Tsar took concrete actions to remove power and responsibility from the Third Section, with which he was becoming quickly disillusioned. Alexander effected this removal of power by granting the responsibility for investigation of political crimes, previously the domain of the Third Section, to the Governors-General of Moscow, Kiev, Warsaw, Odessa, Kharkov, and Saint Petersburg. Two more assassination attempts on the Tsar were made after the decentralization of the Third Section. In November 1879, The People&#x27;s Will, a revolutionary group, attempted to blow up the Tsar&#x27;s train as he travelled from the Crimea to Moscow; however, one bomb failed to detonate and the second destroyed only a shipment of jam meant for the Tsar. The fifth and final unsuccessful assassination attempt occurred February 5, 1880 when a carpenter, Stephen Khalturin, detonated a bomb which he had secreted under the Tsar&#x27;s dining room at the Winter Palace; the bomb killed numerous soldiers and failed to kill Alexander only because he was late for dinner that night. Although the Third Section had had reason to suspect that there might be an attempt made on the Tsar&#x27;s life at the Winter Palace (agents had discovered blueprints of the palace with strange markings during a search of a suspicious person&#x27;s house in St. Petersburg weeks before the attempt) the Section had been unable to search the palace or to keep it under surveillance in large part because the Tsar&#x27;s mistress lived there and so the secret police had to pretend to ignore activities at the palace. 

In the end, the powerful image of the Section and the Gendarmes was largely undermined when they failed to suppress the rising revolutionary movement and acts of terrorism against government officials. The large network of informers and agents often supplied nothing more than rumors and slanders.

On March 3, 1880, Count Loris-Melikov, the chairman of the Supreme Executive Committee that Alexander created in the wake of the Winter Palace bombing to address the wave of revolutionary terrorism, took control of the Third Section and Gendarmerie from General Drenteln and appointed Major-General Cherevin as acting Head Controller. Soon after this change of command, an investigation of the Third Section uncovered a high level of disorganization within the section. Not only did the Third Section have a long backlog of cases to settle (nearly eleven-hundred), various offices of the Section did not even agree on what suspicious people needed to be surveilled. Rather than sort out the confusion and make the Third Section an effective and efficient secret police once again, Count Loris-Melikov ordered it abolished on August 8, 1880.

<text>Moyle District Council was a local council in County Antrim in the northeast of Northern Ireland. It merged with Ballymoney Borough Council, Coleraine Borough Council and Limavady Borough Council in May 2015 under local government reorganisation to become Causeway Coast and Glens District Council.

As a consequence, in 1991 the local government boundary commission originally recommended that the council should be merged with the neighbouring Ballymoney council to create a new council called &quot;Dalriada&quot;. This was strongly opposed by both councils and also by Ballymena which would have gained the Glens of Antrim and a small part of Ballymoney council in the process. After a public enquiry the plans were shelved and Moyle was preserved.

Council headquarters were in Ballycastle.

The council was composed of 15 councillors who were elected from three electoral areas (Ballycastle, Giant&#x27;s Causeway and The Glens) every four years by a system of proportional representation.

Most of the former district forms the North Antrim constituency (together with the neighbouring former Local Council areas of Ballymena and Ballymoney), for elections to the Westminster Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly. The exception is the Glens of Antrim area, most of which is part of the East Antrim constituency. The district was a majority Catholic enclave in the otherwise Protestant County Antrim.

An Independent elected in the 2011 elections joined Sinn Féin in May 2012.

==Review of Public Administration==
Under the Review of Public Administration (RPA) the council was due to merge with Coleraine Borough Council, Limavady Borough Council and Ballymoney Borough Council in 2011 to form Causeway Coast and Glens District, a single council for the enlarged area totalling and a population of 131,564. The next election was due to take place in May 2009, but on 25 April 2008, Shaun Woodward, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland announced that the scheduled 2009 district council elections were to be postponed until 2011. The merger with Coleraine, Limavady and Ballymoney councils was confirmed in September 2011 and took effect in 2015.

==Population==
The area covered by Moyle District Council had a population of 17,050 residents according to the 2011 Northern Ireland census.

<doc id="473924" wikidata="Q1198475" url="?curid=473924" title="Newtownabbey Borough Council">
<text>Newtownabbey Borough Council was a Local Authority in County Antrim in Northern Ireland, on the north shore of Belfast Lough just immediately north of Belfast. The Council merged with Antrim Borough Council in April 2015 under local government reform in Northern Ireland to form Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council.

==History==
Newtownabbey was founded in 1958 as a result of the Newtownabbey Urban District Act (Northern Ireland) 1957 and comprises large urban residential areas along with traditional farming communities. Its major industries include electronics, software and telecommunications development and agriculture. Council headquarters were at Mossley Mill in Newtownabbey. Towns within the area included Ballyclare and Glengormley. The University of Ulster at Jordanstown is also in the area covered by the former Council.

The Newtownabbey Borough Council area consisted of four electoral areas: Antrim Line, Macedon, University, and Ballyclare. At the 2011 elections, 25 members were elected from the following political parties: 12 Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), 5 Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), 5 Alliance Party, 1 Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and 2 Sinn Féin. At the Annual General Meeting of the Council on the first Monday in June each year the Mayor was elected and became the first citizen of the Borough.

In elections for the Westminster Parliament it was split between the East Antrim constituency, the South Antrim constituency and the North Belfast constituency.

In May 2015 Newtownabbey Borough Council merged with Antrim Borough Council to form the new Antrim and Newtownabbey District Council.

==Elections==
When first created for the 1973 local elections, the council consisted of four electoral areas, named A, B, C and D, which elected 21 councillors. For the 1985 local elections, the number of electoral areas was increased to five: Manse Road, Doagh Road, Shore Road, Antrim Line and Ballyclare, each of which elected five councillors. Boundary changes again took effect for the 1993 local elections. The Doagh Road area, centred on Rathcoole was reduced from five to four wards. Consequently it gained the Whiteabbey and Cloughfern wards from the Shore Road district to form the new Macedon district. The Antrim Line district gained the Burnthill ward from the Manse Road district and the Mallusk ward from the Ballyclare district (which had gained a ward in the boundary changes.) The remaining seven wards of the Manse Road and Shore Road districts were combined to form the University district. In relation to the 1973–1981 districts, Ballyclare is similar to Area A, Macedon to Area B, University to Area C and Antrim Line to Area D.

==Summary of seats won 1973–2011==

† Results for Labour are those for Robert Kidd and Mark Langhammer. Kidd was elected for the Northern Ireland Labour Party in 1973, as Independent Labour in 1977, for the Newtownabbey Labour Party in 1981, 1985 and 1997 and for Labour &#x27;87 in 1989. Langhammer was elected as Labour in 1993, 1997 and as an independent in 2001, though describing himself as &quot;Labour&quot; on the council website.

<text>North Down Borough Council was a Local Council in County Down in Northern Ireland. It merged with Ards Borough Council in May 2015 under local government reorganisation in Northern Ireland to become North Down and Ards District Council.

Its main town was Bangor, 12 miles east of Belfast with a population of approximately 68,000. The council was headquartered in Bangor. Its secondary centre was the former Urban District of Holywood, 8 km northeast of Belfast with a population of approximately 10,000. Most of the remainder of a total population was in suburban villages along the southern shore of Belfast Lough. The area of the former Borough is heavily suburbanised, railway links with Belfast are good and the area has been the domain of Belfast commuters since the mid-19th century. The former Borough is often held to be the wealthiest area in Northern Ireland, although there are pockets of deprivation in a string of overspill public housing estates along the Bangor Ring Road.

The borough consisted of 4 electoral areas: Abbey, Ballyholme and Groomsport, Bangor West and Holywood. In the 2011 election, 25 members were elected from the following political parties: 11 Democratic Unionist Party, 6 Alliance, 4 Ulster Unionists, 1 Green, and 2 Independents.
North Down along with Carrickfergus Borough Council were the only councils in Northern Ireland without Nationalist political party representation.

The Borough of North Down was formed in 1973 in the local government reorganisation from the old Bangor Urban District, Holywood Urban District, North Down Rural District and part of Castlereagh Rural District.

In elections for the Westminster Parliament it was part of the slightly larger North Down constituency.

==Summary of seats won 1973–2011==

† Others include Ann Marie Hillen, who stood under the label &quot;Better Bangor Campaign&quot; in 1989, having been elected earlier that year in a by-election. Of the candidates elected in 1993, Jimmy White was elected as a &quot;Holywood Pool Campaigner&quot; and another as &quot;Action &#x27;93&quot;. Alan Chambers, elected at every election from 1993 to 2011, has usually been described on the ballot paper as an Independent, but describes himself on the council website as an Independent Unionist and stood under that label in 1997. He is tallied as Independent Unionist above for all elections.

<text>The Norwegian College of Fishery Science (NCFS or in Norwegian NFH: Norges fiskerihøgskole) was established in 1972 as a joint responsibility of the three Norwegian universities in Tromsø, Bergen and Trondheim. In 1988, a new organisational structure was introduced as NCFS was located to Tromsø and organized as a faculty at the University of Tromsø, keeping some degree of autonomy as its own rector etc. NCFS has a particular responsibility for the development of fundamental and scientific expertise within all areas of fisheries and aquaculture research in Norway. NCFS is also responsible for educating candidates for employment in the fishing industry and fisheries management.

In 2004, NCFS established Centre of Marine Resource Management, also known as the MaReMa Centre, to promote multidisciplinary research in the area of fisheries and coastal zone management.

<text>Software engineering professionalism is a movement to make software engineering a profession, with aspects such as degree and certification programs, professional associations, professional ethics, and government licensing. The field is a licensed discipline in Texas in the United States (Texas Board of Professional Engineers, since 2013), Engineers Australia(Course Accreditation since 2001, not Licensing), and many provinces in Davao.

== History ==
In 1993 the IEEE and ACM began a joint effort called JCESEP, which evolved into SWECC in 1998 to explore making software engineering into a profession. The ACM pulled out of SWECC in May 1999, objecting to its support for the Texas professionalization efforts, of having state licenses for software engineers. ACM determined that the state of knowledge and practice in software engineering was too immature to warrant licensing,
and that licensing would give false assurances of competence even if the body of knowledge were mature.
The IEEE continued to support making software engineering a branch of traditional engineering.

In Canada the Canadian Information Processing Society established the Information Systems Professional certification process. Also, by the late 1990s (1999 in British Columbia) the discipline of software engineering as a professional engineering discipline was officially created. This has caused some disputes between the provincial engineering associations and companies who call their developers software engineers, even though these developers have not been licensed by any engineering association.

In 1999, the Panel of Software Engineering was formed as part of the settlement between Engineering Canada and the Memorial University of Newfoundland over the school&#x27;s use of the term &quot;software engineering&quot; in the name of a computer science program. Concerns were raised over the inappropriate use of the name &quot;software engineering&quot; to describe non-engineering programs could lead to student and public confusion, and ultimately threaten public safety. The Panel issued recommendations to create a Software Engineering Accreditation Board, but the task force created to carry out the recommendations was unable to get the various stakeholders to agree to concrete proposals, resulting in separate accreditation boards.

== Ethics ==
Software engineering ethics is a large field. In some ways it began as an unrealistic attempt to define bugs as unethical. More recently it has been defined as the application of both computer science and engineering philosophy, principles, and practices to the design and development of software systems. Due to this engineering focus and the increased use of software in mission critical and human critical systems, where failure can result in large losses of capital but more importantly lives such as the Therac-25 system, many ethical codes have been developed by a number of societies, associations and organizations. These entities, such as the ACM, IEEE, EGBC and Institute for Certification of Computing Professionals (ICCP) have formal codes of ethics. Adherence to the code of ethics is required as a condition of membership or certification. According to the ICCP, violation of the code can result in revocation of the certificate. Also, all engineering societies require conformance to their ethical codes; violation of the code results in the revocation of the license to practice engineering in the society&#x27;s jurisdiction.

These codes of ethics usually have much in common. They typically relate the need to act consistently with the client&#x27;s interest, employer&#x27;s interest, and most importantly the public&#x27;s interest. They also outline the need to act with professionalism and to promote an ethical approach to the profession.

A Software Engineering Code of Ethics has been approved by the ACM and the IEEE-CS as the standard for teaching and practicing software engineering.

===Examples of codes of conduct===
The following are examples of codes of conduct for Professional Engineers. These 2 have been chosen because both jurisdictions have a designation for Professional Software Engineers.

* Engineers and Geoscientists of British Columbia (EGBC): All members in the association&#x27;s code of Ethics must ensure that the government, the public can rely on BC&#x27;s professional engineers and Geoscientists to act at all times with fairness, courtesy and good faith to their employers, employee and customers, and to uphold the truth, honesty and trustworthiness, and to safe guard human life and the environment. This is just one of the many ways in which BC&#x27;s Professional Engineers and Professional Geoscientists maintain their competitive edge in today&#x27;s global marketplace.
* Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta (APEGA): Different with British Columbia, the Alberta Government granted self governance to engineers, Geoscientists and geophysicists. All members in the APEGA have to accept legal and ethical responsibility for the work and to hold the interest of the public and society. The APEGA is a standards guideline of professional practice to uphold the protection of public interest for engineering, Geoscientists and geophysics in Alberta.

===Opinions on ethics===
Bill Joy argued that &quot;better software&quot; can only enable its privileged end users, make reality more power-pointy as opposed to more humane, and ultimately run away with itself so that &quot;the future doesn&#x27;t need us.&quot; He openly questioned the goals of software engineering in this respect, asking why it isn&#x27;t trying to be more ethical rather than more efficient. In his book Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace, Lawrence Lessig argues that computer code can regulate conduct in much the same way as the legal code. Lessig and Joy urge people to think about the consequences of the software being developed, not only in a functional way, but also in how it affects the public and society as a whole.

Overall, due to the youth of software engineering, many of the ethical codes and values have been borrowed from other fields, such as mechanical and civil engineering. However, there are many ethical questions that even these, much older, disciplines have not encountered. Questions about the ethical impact of internet applications, which have a global reach, have never been encountered until recently and other ethical questions are still to be encountered. This means the ethical codes for software engineering are a work in progress, that will change and update as more questions arise.

==Independent licensing and certification exams==
Since 2002, the IEEE Computer Society offered the Certified Software Development Professional (CSDP) certification exam (in 2015 this was replaced by several similar certifications). A group of experts from industry and academia developed the exam and maintained it. Donald Bagert, and at a later period Stephen Tockey headed the certification committee. Contents of the exam centered around the SWEBOK (Software Engineering Body of Knowledge) guide, with an additional emphasis on Professional Practices and Software Engineering Economics knowledge areas (KAs). The motivation was to produce a structure at an international level for software engineering&#x27;s knowledge areas.

== Criticism of licensing ==
Professional licensing has been criticized for many reasons.
* The field of software engineering is too immature
* Licensing would give false assurances of competence even if the body of knowledge were mature
* Software engineers would have to study years of calculus, physics, and chemistry to pass the exams, which is irrelevant to most software practitioners. Many (most?) computer science majors don&#x27;t earn degrees in engineering schools, so they are probably unqualified to pass engineering exams.

== Licensing by country ==

===United States===

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) classifies &quot;computer software engineers&quot; as a subcategory of &quot;computer specialists&quot;, along with occupations such as computer scientist, Programmer, Database administrator and Network administrator. The BLS classifies all other engineering disciplines, including computer hardware engineers, as &quot;engineers&quot;.

Many states prohibit unlicensed persons from calling themselves an Engineer, or from indicating branches or specialties not covered licensing acts. In many states, the title Engineer is reserved for individuals with a Professional Engineering license indicating that they have shown minimum level of competency through accredited engineering education, qualified engineering experience, and engineering board&#x27;s examinations.

In April 2013 the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) began offering a Professional Engineer (PE) exam for Software Engineering. The exam was developed in association with the IEEE Computer Society. NCEES ended the exam in April 2019 due to lack of participation.

The American National Society of Professional Engineers provides a model law and lobbies legislatures to adopt occupational licensing regulations. The model law requires:
# a four-year degree from a university program accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Committee (EAC) of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET),
# an eight-hour examination on the fundamentals of engineering (FE) usually taken in the senior year of college,
# four years of acceptable experience,
# a second examination on principles and practice, and
# written recommendations from other professional engineers.

Some states require continuing education.

In Texas Donald Bagert of Texas became the first professional software engineer in the U.S. on September 4, 1998 or October 9, 1998. As of May 2002, Texas had issued 44 professional engineering licenses for software engineers. Rochester Institute of Technology granted the first Software Engineering bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 2001. Other universities have followed.

===Canada===
In Canada, the use of the job title &quot;Engineer&quot; is controlled in each province by self-regulating professional engineering organizations who are also tasked with enforcement of the governing legislation. The intent is that any individual holding themselves out as an engineer has been verified to have been educated to a certain accredited level and their professional practice is subject to a code of ethics and peer scrutiny. It is also illegal to use the title Engineer in Canada unless an individual is licensed.

IT professionals with degrees in other fields (such as computer science or information systems) are restricted from using the title &quot;Software Engineer&quot;, or wording &quot;Software Engineer&quot; in a title, depending on their province or territory of residence.

In some instances, cases have been taken to court regarding the illegal use of the protected title &quot;Engineer&quot;.

Most Canadians who earn professional software engineering licenses study software engineering, computer engineering or electrical engineering. Many times these people are already qualified to become professional engineers in their own fields but choose to be licensed as software engineers to differentiate themselves from computer scientists.

In British Columbia, The Limited Licence is granted by the Engineers and Geoscientists of British Columbia. Fees are collected by &quot;EGBC&quot; for the Limited Licensee.

====Ontario====
In Ontario, the Professional Engineers Act stipulates a minimum education level of a three-year diploma in technology from a College of Applied Arts and Technology or a degree in a relevant science area. However, engineering undergraduates and all other applicants are not allowed to use the title of engineer until they complete the minimum amount of work experience of four years in addition to completing the Professional Practice Examination (PPE). If the applicant does not hold an undergraduate engineering degree then they may have to take the Confirmatory Practice Exam or Specific Examination Program unless the exam requirements are waived by a committee.

A person must be granted the “professional engineer” licence to have the right to practise professional software engineering as a Professional Engineer in Ontario.
To become licensed by Professional Engineers Ontario (PEO), one must:
# Be at least 18 years of age.
# Be a citizen or permanent resident of Canada.
# Be of good character. Applicants will be requested to answer questions and make a written declaration on the form as a test of ethics.
# Meet PEO&#x27;s stipulated academic requirements for licensure.
# Pass the Professional Practice Examination.
# Fulfill engineering work experience requirements.

Many graduates of Software Engineering programs are unable to obtain the PEO licence since the work they qualify for after graduation as entry-level is not related to engineering i.e. working in a software company writing code or testing code would not qualify them as their work experience does not fulfill the work experience guidelines the PEO sets. Also Software Engineering programs in Ontario and other provinces involve a series of courses in electrical, electronics, and computers engineering qualifying the graduates to even work in those fields.

====Quebec====
A person must be granted the “engineer” licence to have the right to practise professional software engineering in Quebec. To become licensed by the Quebec order of engineers (in French : Ordre des ingénieurs du Québec - OIQ), a candidate must:
# Be at least 18 years of age.
# Be of good character. The candidate will be requested to answer questions and make a written declaration on the application form to test their ethics.
# Meet OIQ&#x27;s stipulated academic requirements for licensure. In this case, the academic program should be accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board - CEAB)
# Pass the Professional Practice Examination.
# Fulfill engineering work experience requirements.
# Pass the working knowledge of French exam

====Software engineering (SEng) guidelines by Canadian provinces====
The term &quot;engineer&quot; in Canada is restricted to those who have graduated from a qualifying engineering programme. Some universities’ &quot;software engineering&quot; programmes are under the engineering faculty and therefore qualify, for example the University of Waterloo. Others, such as the University of Toronto have &quot;software engineering&quot; in the computer science faculty which does not qualify. This distinction has to do with the way the profession is regulated. Degrees in &quot;Engineering&quot; must be accredited by a national panel and have certain specific requirements to allow the graduate to pursue a career as a professional engineer. &quot;Computer Science&quot; degrees, even those with specialties in software engineering, do not have to meet these requirements so the computer science departments can generally teach a wider variety of topics and students can graduate without specific courses required to pursue a career as a professional engineer.

=== Europe ===
Throughout the whole of Europe, suitably qualified engineers may obtain the professional European Engineer qualification.

=== France ===
In France, the term &quot; (engineer) is not a protected title and can be used by anyone, even by those who do not possess an academic degree.

However, the title &#x27; (Graduate Engineer) is an official academic title that is protected by the government and is associated with the &#x27;, which is one of the most prestigious academic degrees in France.

=== Iceland ===
The use of the title &quot; (computer scientist) is protected by law in Iceland. Software engineering is taught in Computer Science departments in Icelandic universities. Icelandic law state that a permission must be obtained from the Minister of Industry when the degree was awarded abroad, prior to use of the title. The title is awarded to those who have obtained a BSc degree in Computer Science from a recognized higher educational institution.

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, the Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand (IPENZ), which licenses and regulates the country&#x27;s chartered engineers (CPEng), recognizes software engineering as a legitimate branch of professional engineering and accepts application of software engineers to obtain chartered status provided they have a tertiary degree of approved subjects. Software Engineering is included whereas Computer Science is normally not.

<doc id="473950" wikidata="Q351683" url="?curid=473950" title="Vladimir Bartol">
<text>Vladimir Bartol (24 February 1903 – 12 September 1967) was a writer from the Slovene minority in Italy. He is best known for his 1938 novel &quot;Alamut&quot;, the most popular work of Slovene literature around the world, which has been translated into numerous languages.

==Life==
Bartol was born on 24 February 1903 in San Giovanni (), a suburb of the Austro-Hungarian city of Trieste () (now in Italy), in a middle class Slovene minority family. His father Gregor Bartol was a post office clerk, and his mother Marica Bartol Nadlišek was a teacher, a renowned editor and feminist author. He was the third child of seven and his parents offered him extensive education. His mother introduced him to painting, while his father shared with him his interest in biology. Bartol began to be interested in philosophy, psychology, and biology, but also art, theatre, and literature, as described in his autobiographical short stories.

Bartol began his elementary and secondary schooling in Trieste and concluded it in Ljubljana, where he enrolled at the University of Ljubljana to study biology and philosophy. In Ljubljana, he met the young Slovene philosopher Klement Jug who introduced him to the works of Friedrich Nietzsche. Bartol also gave special attention to the works of Sigmund Freud.

He graduated in 1925 and continued his studies at Sorbonne in Paris (1926–1927), for which he obtained a scholarship. In 1928, he served the army in Petrovaradin (now in the autonomous province of Vojvodina in Serbia). From 1933 to 1934, he lived in Belgrade, where he edited the &quot;Slovenian Belgrade Weekly&quot;. Afterward, he returned to Ljubljana where he worked as a freelance writer until 1941. During World War II, he joined Slovene partisans and actively participated in the resistance movement.

After the war, he moved to his hometown Trieste, where he spent an entire decade, from 1946 to 1956. Later he was elected to the Slovenian Academy of Sciences And Arts as an associate member, moved to Ljubljana and continued to work for the Academy until his death on 12 September 1967. He is buried in the Žale cemetery in Ljubljana.

==Work==
Some of his works, including the 1938 novel &quot;Alamut&quot;, have been interpreted as an allegory of the TIGR and the fight against the Italian repression of the Slovene minority in Italy. &quot;Alamut&quot; is set in Persia in the Middle Ages and features the Order of Assassins.

<text>Justice (2002) is a short film by director Yukisada Isao. It stars Tsumabuki Satoshi as Tojo, Christian Storms as Mr. Robert, Ayase Haruka as Hoshi, and Arai Hirofumi as Itadaki. The movie was released by Sega/Amuse as part of the &quot;Jam Films&quot; collection.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Justice&quot; is set in a Japanese high school, where Mr. Robert&#x27;s class is doing a running translation of the Potsdam Declaration. The action in the classroom is centered on:
*Mr. Robert&#x27;s lifeless, monotonous recitation of the document.
*Itadaki&#x27;s hurried efforts to write it all down in grammatically correct Japanese prose.
*An unnamed student&#x27;s creation of pornographic flipbook animation in the corner of one of his textbooks.
*The initially drowsy Tojo.

Tojo, who is not paying attention, wakes up when he realizes a girls&#x27; gym class is running the hurdles outside. He clears the books and blank notes off his desk and begins to watch. Using the five-stroke Chinese character &quot;正&quot;, Tojo keeps a running tally of when the girls readjust their &quot;buruma&quot; (literally &quot;bloomers&quot;, roughly the same as the spankies cheerleaders and female volleyball players wear). Each readjustment is recorded with a color (red, blue, or green) and emphasized for the audience by the sound of snapping spandex.

The stunning Hoshi notices Tojo staring at her and she self-consciously puts her all into her time. When she trips over a hurdle and hits the asphalt, Tojo can&#x27;t hide his alarm. Immediately, Mr. Robert turns on him and lectures about focusing on Potsdam rather than &quot;buruma&quot;. He uses racist language — &quot;What do you Japs mean by this character?&quot; — when he asks Tojo about the &quot;正正正&quot; written on the desk; Tojo&#x27;s reply is &quot;justice&quot; (&quot;justice&quot; being 正義 in Japanese). After Mr. Robert looks out the window, who is astonished by the girls&#x27; beauty at the first sight, he throws Tojo out of class and tells him in English and Japanese to &quot;get out in the hall&quot;.

The girls&#x27; gym class comes back into the building and Hoshi flirtatiously confronts Tojo, who sprouts a nosebleed when he sees her adjust her bloomers. He denies all wrongdoing but grins at the camera and displays a &quot;V&quot; for &quot;victory&quot; once Hoshi&#x27;s back is turned.

<doc id="473969" wikidata="Q2057505" url="?curid=473969" title="Patrick Cox">
<text>Patrick Cox (born March 19, 1963) is a Canadian-British fashion designer and an eponymous fashion label specializing in the creation of shoes, leather goods and accessories. Cox is most noted for the use of unusual materials and a mixture of avant-garde and traditional styles.

Cox was born in Edmonton, Alberta, to a ballerina Canadian mother and linguist English father. Cox was educated locally, except for periods when his father&#x27;s work led the family to postings in Nigeria, Chad and Cameroon. Cox eventually graduated from school in Edmonton Canada and moved to Toronto on his own when he was 17.

== Early career ==
At the age of 19, Cox produced his first pair of shoes, for the Toronto-based designer Loucas Kleanthous, who suggested Cox consider a career as a designer. An interest in British fashion led Cox to study at Cordwainer&#x27;s Technical College, London, a design school that was absorbed into the London College of Fashion in 2000. Cox studied at Cordwainer&#x27;s from 1983 to 1985. He graduated with merit in July 1985.

During his time as a student in London, Cox probably spent as much time in nightclubs as he did studying. Through his partying Cox became friends with several well-known designers, such as the legendary Vivienne Westwood. As a result, in 1984, Westwood asked Cox to design shoes for her &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; collection. One of the shoes that Cox created incorporated a 4-inch platform that would become the prototype of a 9-inch pair later worn by supermodel Naomi Campbell, when she famously fell during a Westwood fashion show in Paris, France in 1993. In his second year of college Cox designed and handmade fluorescent fringed moccasins for the celebrated Body Map brand of David Holah and Stevie Stewart.

==Personal life==

Cox used to date Canadian journalist, entrepreneur, and magazine publisher Tyler Brûlé. Cox funded the launch of Brûlé&#x27;s &quot;Wallpaper&quot; magazine that was subsequently sold to Time Warner in 1997. They split up in 1997.

== Working life ==
Cox set up his own company designing shoes in 1985, and in 1986 designed the shoes for John Galliano&#x27;s &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; collection. Subsequently, Cox launched his own Patrick Cox label, adopting the fleur-de-lys logo. Cox continued to work with Galliano for two more seasons. He also produced the shoes for numerous designers&#x27; fashion shows including Anna Sui, John Flett, Alistair Blair and Lanvin Haute Couture to name but a few.

In 1991, Cox opened his first shop opposite the Peter Jones department store in Sloane Square, Chelsea, a well-known fashion district of London. In 1993, Cox marketed his first collection designed for the mass market. This diffusion range called &quot;Wannabe&quot; increased the company&#x27;s semi annual sales from 2,000 to 200,000 pairs. Cox’s signature silhouette was a loafer with a chunky heel, reminiscent of the 1970s disco platforms worn inside Studio 54. Cox has credited his initial interest in moccasins to fellow designer Richard James whom had asked Cox to design him a modern loafer to accessorise one of his early 1990s fashion shows.

In 1994, Cox opened his first Parisian store on the right bank, followed in 1995 by a second store in London on Sloane Street, a new store on New York&#x27;s Madison Avenue and a second store in Paris on the left bank. During this time, Cox was twice awarded Accessory Designer of the Year at the British Fashion Awards. 1998 saw Cox move his design office and production from the UK to Civitanova, in the Italian Marche, an area known for shoe manufacture.

From his early association with Vivienne Westwood onwards, Cox developed a cult like status in Japan and in 1996 signed a 10-year licensing deal with leading Japanese luxury department store group Isetan. This deal saw the opening of more than 40 shop in shops across Japan and a whole range of licensed Japanese products including ready-to-wear, bags, jewellery and watches.

Cox was approached by the French fashion footwear house Charles Jourdan, and in January 2003 he was appointed Creative Director, his brief being to rejuvenate the brand. After 3 years of successful collaboration, Cox decided to move on to concentrate on the development of his own label.

The Hong Kong duty free company King Power Group took a controlling interest in the Patrick Cox company in 2006. Cox left the eponymous firm the following year and the entire business, except for a few continuing Japanese licenses was closed in 2008.

In September 2010, Cox opened &#x27;Cox Cookies &amp; Cake&#x27;, a pâtisserie in London&#x27;s Soho district, with Eric Lanlard to whom he was introduced by Elizabeth Hurley. In keeping with the area&#x27;s history of seedy business, the décor was black and neon while the staff wore studded leather aprons. Delicacies included titty and bum cupcakes along with his mother Maureen&#x27;s recipe for traditional Canadian Nanaimo bars. After two successful years trading Cox decided to close the business to return to shoe design.

In 2011, Cox was approached to design for the Italian shoe giant Geox. The resulting GEOX Designed by Patrick Cox capsule collection incorporated his witty ironic British take on design.

In 2016, Cox returned to fashion with his Lathbridge collection of shoes and leather goods. The brand name is Cox&#x27;s middle name and the company logo is the bulldog, inspired by Cox&#x27;s pet English bulldogs Caesar and Brutus.
