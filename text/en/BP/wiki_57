<text>Waipukurau is the largest town in the Central Hawke&#x27;s Bay District on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand. It is located on the banks of the Tukituki River, 7 kilometres south of Waipawa and 50 kilometres southwest of Hastings.

==History and culture==

===Māori===
Central Hawkes Bay, where the town is located was settled by Te Aitanga a Whatonga, the descendants of Whatonga, grandson of Toi Kairakau. These were the Ngati Tara and Rangitāne peoples. In the mid 1500s the Ngāti Kahungunu invaded the area from the north and in the subsequent fighting drove the Rangitāne south into the Tahoraiti area (Dannevirke). Warfare continued through the 1600s until the time of Te Rangikoianake. His first child Te Kikiri was adopted by the Ngai Toroiwaho to be their chief - he had mana over the Waipukurau district.

Fighting broke out again in the 1800s at Mangatoetoe between Ngai Te Upokoiri and Ngāti Te Rangikoianake of Poukawa. Several of Te Rangikoianake&#x27;s grand children were killed in this fight. Pareihe, a Ngati Rangikoianake Chief, avenged the defeat in a battle at Pukekaihau, Waipukurau after which a peace accord was made between the two tribes.

The accord was short lived with the death of Te Wanikau&#x27;s brother-in-law (Chief of Ngai Te Upokoiri) prompting further conflict over the erection of rahui poles on Lake Poukawa, Ngati Rangikoianake&#x27;s eel fishing area. The conflict, starting around 1819 and lasting till 1824 ended with the Ngati Rangikoianake and other local tribes evacuating the area and settling at Mahia. In the latter part of the 1820s Pareihe attacked the Ngai Te Upokoiri and regained the lands they had lost, with the Ngai Te Upokoiri taking refuge in the Manawatū. A peace accord was made between Pareihe and the Ngāti Tūwharetoa in the late 1830s. The Ngati Tuwharetoa had been allied with the Ngai Te Upokoiri.

Within the current township is Pukekaihau hill, now in Paul Hunter Memorial Park, the site of the Māori Pā, from which it gets its name. Waipukurau is said to mean the water of pukerau, &quot;wai&quot; being water and &quot;pukerau&quot; being a type of giant puffball fungus. The pa was near the old Māori trail from the Manawatū Gorge and Hawkes Bay. The first Europeans who are known to have passed through the area were Bishop George Selwyn and Chief Justice Sir William Martin in November 1842 en route to Napier.

===European===

In December 1850 Donald McLean and his party of Land Commissioners met with the Central Hawkes Bay tribes to discuss purchasing a large block of land for European settlement. Negotiations proceeded through till 4 November 1851 when an area of land called the Waipukurau Block, some 279,000 acres, including the land the town is situated on was acquired from local Māori, led by &quot;Te Hapuku&quot; for £4,800. Henry Russell acquired the land surrounding Waipukurau, calling it Mount Herbert station.

In 1857 there was an accommodation house run by a Mr Aveson. This was sold in October 1858 to George Lloyd and renamed Lloyds Hotel. The Hotel was transferred again in 1861 becoming Moss&#x27;s Inn or the Tavistock Hotel. It was moved to its present site nearer the railway in 1916 and has been empty since 2013. A Town Hall was built nearby in 1877. It burnt down on 18 November 1922.

Horse racing started in 1859 with the first recorded meeting on 2 February. The provincial council approved construction of roading from Waipukurau to Porongahau, a goal, and the appointment of a Constable at Waipukurau in 1859. Roading to Forty-mile bush was not commenced until late 1867.

By at least 1858 Waipukurau was used as a hub for mail delivery to the district, a sale yard for stock, and a court venue. In 1863 land was offered to the Agricultural Society for a show. By 1864 the Presbyterians were looking to set up a church in Waipukurau. There was a school in town by 1866 but this was closed when the building it used was destroyed by fire that year. The school was replaced in August 1867 by new building which was to serve as both a church and a school. The school had 9 pupils.

In 1867 Russell acquired the Pa Flat native reserve and founded Waipukurau on it as a model village. Russel chose the residents and approved the house plans.

Cobb and Co commenced the first coach service to the town in October 1867. A coach road to the south reached Norsewood in December 1873 and the Manawatū Gorge in February 1874. Tenders for a coach service from Waipukurau to Palmerston North were called for in March. The contract was awarded to Andrew Young, whose coach operated from Foxton. On his first journey from Foxton to Waipukurau his coach was intercepted by Alexander MacDonald as he was attempting to cross the Oroua River on former Ngāti Kauwhata land near Schultz&#x27;s Hotel at Awahuri. MacDonald shot one of the lead horses preventing Young from continuing his journey. MacDonald was a staunch supporter of the Ngāti Kauwhata and had been seeking redress for the dispossession of the tribe from its land on 15 December 1866. MacDonald was imprisoned for three months because of this action, but his action did result in the tribe regaining some 6,200 acres of its land.

In October 1867 a dispute broke out between the residents of Waipukurau and the neighbouring township of Waipawa over the location of a telegraph station. The Provincial Council favoured Waipawa as the location. However, the Government&#x27;s Telegraph Department preferred Waipukurau due its slightly more central location. The office was opened on 9 June 1868. Several weeks later on 22 June Frederick Christian Schäfer, passed through the town. Schäfer was a global traveller from Carlhafen in Hesse-Cassel who had walked through most of Europe, Palestine, two thirds of the way across the United States, Australia, Japan, China, Batavia, and Sumatra. He walked from Wellington to Waipukurau in 18 days.

One of the first sheep shearing competitions in New Zealand took place at Waipukurau in January 1868. Its purpose was to improve the quality of shearing, As a local response to Te Kooti&#x27;s escape and conflict on the East Coast, a stockade was erected in late 1869, in what is now Hunter Memorial Park.

In November 1869 a Methodist Church was formed in the town. A boiling down works was constructed in March 1870, the same time a brewery was proposed and a flax mill opened.

==== Railway station ====

Construction of a railway from Napier to Waipukurau commenced in 1872. The target was to complete the line by September 1873. This was not achieved and the extension to Waipukurau was opened just three days after Waipawa on 1 September 1876. A holiday was declared and two trains ran from Napier to celebrate the opening on Friday 8 September. The link to Palmerston North was not completed until 9 March 1891 due in part to the more difficult country and the impact of the Long Depression. The extension to Waipukurau was built by the international contractor, Brogdens, for £9,469 7s 9d.

In 1874 Edmund G Allen won a £14,100 contract for the extension south to Takapau. Waipukurau had been the terminus of the line for just over 6 months, when it opened on 12 March 1877. There were then two trains a day from Napier, one of which continued to Takapau.

In 1875 a station and stationmaster&#x27;s house were built and a single track engine shed was added in 1877, just north of the station. Sixty years later the shed was leased to Belwood Bitumen Products Ltd. Railway houses were built in 1876, 1883, 1905, 1926 (5), 1931 (2), 1933 (2), 1955 and 1956. Refreshment rooms were built in 1887, or 1888. Trains were then allowed a stop of up to 10 minutes at the station. By then Waipukurau had 3 trains a day from Napier, taking two to three hours to cover the . By 1896 Waipukurau had a 3rd class station, luggage room, platform, cart approach, x goods shed (moved from Pakipaki in 1875), loading bank, cattle yards, water, coal shed, turntable (, extended in 1921 for the AB class, in 1934 that turntable went to Tāneatua and a turntable came from Paekakariki in 1936. During the 1979 bridge works that turntable was sent to Masterton), engine shed, stationmaster&#x27;s house, urinals and a passing loop for 49 wagons. In 1909 electric tablet signalling began between Lower Hutt and Waipukurau. On 24 March 1922 there was a refreshment room fire and the railways took over direct running of them from 1923. On 22 November 1929 the station safe was blown open. By that year, over 30 people were employed at the station, where they sold 20,816 tickets (4th busiest station on the line, after Napier, Hastings and Dannevirke) and handled 13,062 sheep and pigs.

In 1881 Wilding &amp; Bull had a siding and built a large sawmill beside the station. Much of the timber came from Seventy Mile Bush. There were also sidings for a grain store, British Imperial Oil and Vacuum Oil Co.

On 7 October 2001 the station closed to passengers. The platform, station and passing loop remain.

===== Tukituki railway bridge =====
Harry Monteith built a 22-span Waipukurau bridge. A footbridge was added in 1883 and it was repaired in 1897. It was replaced in 1978, at which time the stockyards were closed to improve the alignment of the track to the new bridge. Tuki Tuki River bridge 171 is long.

===== Tarewa and Tapairu railway stations =====
A mile to the north of Waipukurau, there was a flag station below Mount Vernon from 1877 to 1884. Its closure was announced several times, including in 1886, when the building was moved from Tarewa, to Tapairu, a mile south of Waipawa, which seems to have been open until 1889, or 1890. In 2009 the nearby SH2 road overbridge, which had replaced a level crossing in 1937, was replaced by a larger culvert to straighten the road.


===Marae===

The local Waipukurau Marae is affiliated with the Ngāti Kahungunu hapū of Ngāti Whatuiāpiti and Ngāti Tamatea.

==Hospital==
In 1876 the Government donated 5 acres of land for a Hospital which was to be half paid for by the local community. It was completed in 1879 and consisted of two wings – the male and female wards, as well as four other rooms to house staff. It also had a dispensary, committee room, dining room, and kitchen. The hospital was the Waipawa County Hospital until 1907. In 1909 a further ward built. In 1919, as a result of the influenza pandemic, an infectious disease annex. This building became the geriatric unit in 1962. A nurses’ home was built in 1926 and extended in 1942.

An administration block was erected in 1927, with the former administration area became a children&#x27;s ward. In 1935 further alterations were carried out which added a medical administration and outpatients’ wing and an operating theatre . From 1942 to 1964 two new wards, clinics for x-ray and physiotherapy, a laboratory, an administration block, a mortuary, and an operating theatre were added. Finally in 1966 additions were made to the maternity annexe. The hospital was closed in 1999.

== Employment ==
The town is a farming based community and provides dairy, fruit, vegetable and meat exports. Most employment is seasonal related, dependent on surrounding local agricultural and horticultural industries.

Through the 1940s-1970s one of the town&#x27;s main businesses was Denne Bros/Peter Pan Frozen Foods, well known throughout the country for their ice cream brand. The two factories were considered local landmarks. The company was the main employer of Waipukurau, as well the nearby township Waipawa in the 1950s and 1960s.

<text>In genetics, an expressed sequence tag (EST) is a short sub-sequence of a cDNA sequence. ESTs may be used to identify gene transcripts, and were instrumental in gene discovery and in gene-sequence determination. The identification of ESTs has proceeded rapidly, with approximately 74.2 million ESTs now available in public databases (e.g. GenBank 1 January 2013, all species). EST approaches have largely been superseded by whole genome and transcriptome sequencing and metagenome sequencing.

An EST results from one-shot sequencing of a cloned cDNA. The cDNAs used for EST generation are typically individual clones from a cDNA library. The resulting sequence is a relatively low-quality fragment whose length is limited by current technology to approximately 500 to 800 nucleotides. Because these clones consist of DNA that is complementary to mRNA, the ESTs represent portions of expressed genes. They may be represented in databases as either cDNA/mRNA sequence or as the reverse complement of the mRNA, the template strand.

One can map ESTs to specific chromosome locations using physical mapping techniques, such as radiation hybrid mapping, HAPPY mapping, or FISH. Alternatively, if the genome of the organism that originated the EST has been sequenced, one can align the EST sequence to that genome using a computer.

The current understanding of the human set of genes () includes the existence of thousands of genes based solely on EST evidence. In this respect, ESTs have become a tool to refine the predicted transcripts for those genes, which leads to the prediction of their protein products and ultimately of their function. Moreover, the situation in which those ESTs are obtained (tissue, organ, disease state - e.g. cancer) gives information on the conditions in which the corresponding gene is acting. ESTs contain enough information to permit the design of precise probes for DNA microarrays that then can be used to determine gene expression profiles.

Some authors use the term &quot;EST&quot; to describe genes for which little or no further information exists besides the tag.

==History==
In 1979, teams at Harvard and Caltech extended the basic idea of making DNA copies of mRNAs in vitro to amplifying a library of such in bacterial plasmids.

In 1982, the idea of selecting random or semi-random clones from such a cDNA library for sequencing was explored by Greg Sutcliffe and coworkers.

In 1983, Putney et al. sequenced 178 clones from a rabbit muscle cDNA library.

In 1991, Adams and co-workers coined the term EST and initiated more systematic sequencing as a project (starting with 600 brain cDNAs).

== Sources of data and annotations ==

=== dbEST ===
The dbEST is a division of Genbank established in 1992. As for GenBank, data in dbEST is directly submitted by laboratories worldwide and is not curated.

=== EST contigs ===
Because of the way ESTs are sequenced, many distinct expressed sequence tags are often partial sequences that correspond to the same mRNA of an organism. In an effort to reduce the number of expressed sequence tags for downstream gene discovery analyses, several groups assembled expressed sequence tags into EST contigs. Example of resources that provide EST contigs include: TIGR gene indices, Unigene, and STACK 

Constructing EST contigs is not trivial and may yield artifacts (contigs that contain two distinct gene products). When the complete genome sequence of an organism is available and transcripts are annotated, it is possible to bypass contig assembly and directly match transcripts with ESTs. This approach is used in the TissueInfo system (see below) and makes it easy to link annotations in the genomic database to tissue information provided by EST data.

=== Tissue information===

High-throughput analyses of ESTs often encounter similar data management challenges. A first challenge is that tissue provenance of EST libraries is described in plain English in dbEST. This makes it difficult to write programs that can unambiguously determine that two EST libraries were sequenced from the same tissue. Similarly, disease conditions for the tissue are not annotated in a computationally friendly manner. For instance, cancer origin of a library is often mixed with the tissue name (e.g., the tissue name &quot;glioblastoma&quot; indicates that the EST library was sequenced from brain tissue and the disease condition is cancer). With the notable exception of cancer, the disease condition is often not recorded in dbEST entries. The TissueInfo project was started in 2000 to help with these challenges. The project provides curated data (updated daily) to disambiguate tissue origin and disease state (cancer/non cancer), offers a tissue ontology that links tissues and organs by &quot;is part of&quot; relationships (i.e., formalizes knowledge that hypothalamus is part of brain, and that brain is part of the central nervous system) and distributes open-source software for linking transcript annotations from sequenced genomes to tissue expression profiles calculated with data in dbEST.

<doc id="477427" wikidata="Q859686" url="?curid=477427" title="Bighorn River">
<text>The Bighorn River is a tributary of the Yellowstone, approximately long, in the states of Wyoming and Montana in the western United States. The river was named in 1805 by fur trader François Larocque for the bighorn sheep he saw along its banks as he explored the Yellowstone.

The upper reaches of the Bighorn, south of the Owl Creek Mountains in Wyoming, are known as the Wind River. The two rivers are sometimes referred to as the Wind/Bighorn. The Wind River officially becomes the Bighorn River at the Wedding of the Waters, on the north side of the Wind River Canyon near the town of Thermopolis. From there, the river flows through the Bighorn Basin in north central Wyoming, passing through Thermopolis and Hot Springs State Park.

At the border with Montana, the river turns northeast, and flows past the north end of the Bighorn Mountains, through the Crow Indian Reservation, where the Yellowtail Dam forms the Bighorn Lake reservoir. The reservoir and the surrounding canyon are part of the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area.

The Little Bighorn River joins the Bighorn near the town of Hardin, Montana. Approximately farther downriver, the Bighorn River ends where it joins the Yellowstone.

==Course==

The Bighorn River begins as the Wind River in the Rocky Mountains at Wind River Lake, near Two Ocean Mountain and the summit of Togwotee Pass. The Wind River flows southeast receiving the east fork of the Wind River from the north, and enters the Wind River Basin, flowing past Dubois and Johnstown, to Riverton, where it receives the Little Wind River. The river then changes direction to the northeast and then the north, flowing into Boysen Reservoir, which is formed by Boysen Dam. Below the dam it enters the Wind River Canyon, where the river narrows and forms many rapids. At the end of the canyon the Wind River widens out in an area called the &quot;Wedding of the Waters&quot; where it becomes the Bighorn River and enters the Bighorn Basin. The Bighorn continues northward, passing through Thermopolis, Worland, and Basin. At Greybull it receives the Greybull River, and about north of that confluence it enters Bighorn Lake, where it is joined by the Shoshone River. North of the confluence with the Shoshone, the reservoir narrows as the river enters the Bighorn Canyon, where it crosses into Montana. At the end of the canyon, the river passes through Yellowtail Dam and Afterbay Dam. The river turns to the northeast and enters the Great Plains. At Hardin the river is joined by the Little Bighorn River. Approximately downriver from the Little Bighorn, in Big Horn County, the Bighorn empties into the Yellowstone.

==Names==

The Bighorn River has also been known as the Great Horn River, Le Corne and Iisaxpúatahcheeaashisee in the Apsáalooke language which translates to English as &quot;Large Bighorn Sheep River&quot;. Its Gros Ventre name is .

<doc id="477437" wikidata="Q689310" url="?curid=477437" title="Ducted fan">
<text>In aeronautics, a ducted fan is a thrust-generating mechanical fan or propeller mounted within a cylindrical or shroud. Other terms include ducted propeller or shrouded propeller. When used in vertical takeoff and landing
(VTOL) applications it is also known as a shrouded rotor.

Ducted fans are used for propulsion or direct lift in many types of vehicle including airplanes, airships, hovercraft, and powered lift VTOL aircraft. The high-bypass turbofan engines used on many modern airliners is an example of a very successful and popular use of ducted fan design.

The duct increases thrust, in comparison to a similar-sized propeller in free air. Ducted fans are quieter, and offer good opportunities for thrust vectoring. The shroud offers good protection to ground personnel from accidentally contacting the spinning blades, as well as protecting the blades themselves from external debris or objects. By varying the cross-section of the duct the designer can advantageously affect the velocity and pressure of the airflow according to Bernoulli&#x27;s principle. 

Drawbacks include increased weight due to the added structure of the shroud, a need for precision in tolerances of blade-tip to shroud clearance, a need for better vibration control compared to free-air propellers, and complex duct design requirements. Lastly, when at high angles of attack, the shroud can stall and produce high drag.

==Design==
A ducted fan has three main components; the fan or propeller which provides thrust or lift, the duct or shroud which surrounds the fan, and the engine or motor which powers the fan.

===Fan===
Like any other fan, propeller or rotor, a ducted fan is characterised by the number of blades. The Rhein Flugzeugbau (RFB) SG 85 had three blades, while the Dowty Rotol Ducted Propulsor had seven. The blades may be of fixed or variable pitch. See: Fan (machine)

===Duct===
The duct or shroud is an aerodynamic ring which surrounds the fan and closely fits the blade tips. It must be made rigid enough not to distort under flight loads nor touch the blades as they turn. The duct performs several functions:

Principally, it reduces the vortices created by air flowing round the ends of the blades. This reduces the aerodynamic losses or drag, thus increasing the overall efficiency of the fan. Because of this, the fan can either be used to provide increased thrust and aircraft performance, or be made smaller than the equivalent free propeller.

It provides acoustic shielding which, together with the reduced energy waste, significantly cuts noise emissions from the propeller.

It acts as a protective device, to protect objects such as ground staff from being hit by the whirling blades, to protect the blades from damage during such an impact, and to protect the aircraft fuselage and contents (including crew, passengers, fuel tanks, hydraulic systems, etc.) from impact damage in the event of propeller failure.

The reduced tip vortices also mean that the fan wake is less turbulent. With careful design, the heated discharge from the engine cooling system can be injected into the low-turbulence fan wake to increase thrust.

===Powerplant===
A ducted fan may be powered by any kind of motor capable of turning the fan. Examples include piston, rotary (Wankel), and turboshaft combustion engines, as well as electric motors.

The fan may be mounted directly on the powerplant output shaft, or driven remotely via an extended drive shaft and gearing. In the remote arrangement, several fans may be driven by a single powerplant.

===Ducted propulsion===
An assembly designed throughout as a single integrated unit is referred to as a fan pod or ducted propulsor.

An advantage of the pod approach is that the design of each component can be matched to the others, helping to maximise performance and minimise weight. It also eases the vehicle designer&#x27;s task of integration with the vehicle and its systems.

===Limitations===
* Good efficiency requires very small clearances between the blade tips and the duct.
* Efficiency advantages are reduced, and may even be reversed, at lower rotation speeds, thrust levels and airspeeds.
* Requires reduced vibration levels compared to a free propeller or rotor.
* Complex duct design, and weight increase even if constructed from advanced composites.
* At high angle of attack, parts of the duct will stall and produce aerodynamic drag.

==Applications==
In aircraft applications, the operating speed of an unshrouded propeller is limited since tip speeds approach the sound barrier at lower speeds than an equivalent ducted fan. The most common ducted fan arrangement used in full-sized aircraft is a turbofan engine, where the power to turn the fan is provided by a gas turbine. High bypass ratio turbofan engines are used on nearly all civilian airliners, while military fighters usually make use of the better high-speed performance of a low bypass ratio turbofan with a smaller fan diameter. However, a ducted fan may be powered by any source of shaft power such as a reciprocating engine, Wankel engine, or electric motor. A kind of ducted fan, known as a fantail or by the trademark name Fenestron, is also used to replace tail rotors on helicopters.
Ducted fans are favored in VTOL aircraft such as the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, and other low-speed designs such as hovercraft for their higher thrust-to-weight ratio. 

In some cases, a shrouded rotor can be 94% more efficient than an open rotor. The improved performance is mainly because the outward flow is less contracted and thus carries more kinetic energy.

Among model aircraft hobbyists, the ducted fan is popular with builders of high-performance radio controlled model aircraft. Glow plug engines combined with ducted-fan units were the first achievable means of modeling a scaled-size jet aircraft. Despite the introduction of model-scale turbojet engines, electric-powered ducted fans remain popular on smaller, lower-cost model aircraft. Some electric-powered ducted fan airplanes can reach speeds of more than 320km/h (200mph).

Most cooling fans used in computers contain a duct integrated into the fan assembly; the duct is also used for mechanically mounting the fan to other components.

<doc id="477450" wikidata="Q27685" url="?curid=477450" title="Phoenix (plant)">
<text>Phoenix is a genus of 14 species of palms, native to an area starting from the Canary Islands in the west, across northern and central Africa, to the extreme southeast of Europe (Crete), and continuing throughout southern Asia, from Anatolia east to southern China and Malaysia. The diverse habitats they occupy include swamps, deserts, and mangrove sea coasts. Most &quot;Phoenix&quot; species originate in semi-arid regions, but usually occur near high groundwater levels, rivers, or springs. The genus is unusual among members of subfamily Coryphoideae in having pinnate, rather than palmate leaves; tribe Caryoteae also have pinnate or bipinnate leaves.

The palms were more numerous and widespread in the past than they are at present. Some &quot;Phoenix&quot; palms have become naturalised in other parts of the world; in particular, the date palm&#x27;s long history of cultivation means that escaped plants in the past have long-since become ingrained into the native ecosystems of countries far from its original range in the Middle East.

==Etymology==
The generic name derives from φοῖνιξ (&quot;phoinix&quot;) or φοίνικος (&quot;phoinikos&quot;), the Greek word for the date palm used by Theophrastus and Pliny the Elder. It most likely referred to either the Phoenicians; Phoenix, the son of Amyntor and Cleobule in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;; or the phoenix, the sacred bird of Ancient Egypt.

==Description==
This genus is mostly medium to robust in size, but also includes a few dwarf species; trunks are solitary in four species, suckering and clumped in nine, of which one has a prostrate ground trunk. Many of the trunked species do not form above-ground stems for several years. The pinnate leaves, 1–6 m long, all share the common feature of metamorphosed lower-leaf segments into long, vicious spines (acanthophylls). The leaves have short or absent petioles and possess the rare feature among pinnate palms of induplicate (V-shaped) leaflets. The plants are dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate plants; pollination is by both wind and insect. The flowers are inconspicuous yellowish-brown and about 1 cm wide, but grouped on conspicuous large multibranched panicles 30–90 cm long. The inflorescence emerges from a usually boat-shaped, leathery bract, forming large, pendent clusters. &quot;Phoenix&quot; fruit develops from one carpel as a berry, 1–7 cm long, yellow to red-brown or dark purple when mature, with one elongated, deeply grooved seed.
==Ecology==
A majority of the forest palms grow under the shade of dominating forests trees along fragile hill slopes and stream courses in warm, humid conditions. The palms are found growing on a wide variety of soils, often extending to degraded forest margins in grasslands. In the tropics, most are found below 1250 m altitude. Branching of the aerial trunk is rare and is mainly induced by injury to the terminal growing bud. Flowering and fruit are regular and annual.

The reproduction is by seeds and by vegetative multiplication. Many species of &quot;Phoenix&quot; produce vegetative offshoots called bulbils from basal portions of their stems which, on rooting, develop new saplings.
Close relationship among the 14 species is illustrated by the ease of hybridisation and cross-pollination. Several natural hybrids were hence obtained: &quot;P. dactylifera&quot; × &quot;P. sylvestris&quot; (India), &quot;P. dactylifera&quot; × &quot;P. canariensis&quot; (Morocco, Algeria and Israel), and &quot;P. dactylifera&quot; × &quot;P. reclinata&quot; (Senegal).
&quot;Phoenix&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including &quot;Paysandisia archon&quot; and the &quot;Batrachedra&quot; species &quot;B. amydraula&quot; (recorded on &quot;P. dactylifera&quot;), &quot;B. arenosella&quot; and &quot;B. isochtha&quot; (feeds exclusively on &quot;Phoenix&quot; spp.). They are also hosts to the palm weevil borer &quot;Diocalandra frumenti&quot;.

==Uses==

The fruit of &quot;P. dactylifera&quot;, the date of commerce, is large with a thick layer of fruit pulp, edible, very sweet and rich in sugar; the other species have only a thin layer of fruit pulp. The central soft part of the stem of &quot;P. rupicola&quot;, &quot;P. acaulis&quot;, and &quot;P. humilis&quot; is a rich source of starch. Palms are felled to extract this central ‘pith’ which is dried, powdered, stored and used for preparation of bread in the Indian subcontinent. The &quot;P. canariensis&quot; sap is cooked to a sweet, thick syrup. &quot;P. sylvestris&quot; Roxb. is widely used in India as a source of sugar. The sugary sap from some African palms yields country liquor on fermentation (palm wine).

While &quot;P. dactylifera&quot; is grown for its edible dates, the Canary Island date palm (&quot;P. canariensis&quot;) and pygmy date palm (&quot;P. roebelenii&quot;) are widely grown as ornamental plants, but their dates are used as food for livestock and poultry. The Canary Island date palm differs from the date palm in having a stouter trunk, more leaves to the crown, more closely spaced leaflets, and deep green rather than grey-green leaves. The fruit of &quot;P. canariensis&quot; is edible, but rarely eaten by humans because of their small size and thin flesh.

The different species of the genus frequently hybridise where they grow in proximity. This can be a problem when planting &quot;P. canariensis&quot; as an ornamental plant, as the hybrid palms are aesthetically inferior and do not match the pure-bred plants when planted in avenues, etc.

== Species ==

==Fossil record==
A large number of fossil woods with anatomical features resembling the genus &quot;Phoenix&quot; have been excavated from Deccan Intertrappean formation in India of Maastrichtian-Danian age (65-67 my). Discovery of biocompounds from the fossil woods have affinity with the biocompounds known from modern &quot;Phoenix&quot; species.

A &quot;Phoenix&quot; seed from the latest Paleocene has been excavated from the Petit Pâtis quarry in Rivecourt, France.

<text>Wallace Maynard Cox (December 6, 1924 – February 15, 1973) was an American actor. He began his career as a standup comedian and played the title character of the popular early U.S. television series &quot;Mister Peepers&quot; from 1952 to 1955. He also appeared as a character actor in over 20 films and dozens of television episodes. Cox was the voice of the animated canine superhero Underdog in the &quot;Underdog&quot; TV series.

==Early life, education, and career beginnings==
Cox was born on December 6, 1924, in Detroit, Michigan. When he was 10, he moved with his divorced mother (mystery author Eleanor Blake) and a younger sister to Evanston, Illinois, where he became close friends with another child in the neighborhood, Marlon Brando. His family moved several times, including a move to New York City, and Cox graduated from Denby High School after they returned to Detroit.

During World War II, Cox and his family returned to New York City, where he attended the City College of New York. He spent four months in the United States Army. According to the accounts of a fellow enlisted soldier, Cox adopted odd behaviors while undergoing basic training at Camp Wolters, Texas, such as putting on a uniform and full pack to pick flowers on Sundays, to receive a discharge from the Army. After his discharge he attended New York University. He supported his invalid mother and sister by making and selling jewelry in a small shop, and entertaining at parties doing comedy monologues. These led to regular performances at nightclubs, including the Village Vanguard, beginning in December 1948.

He became Brando&#x27;s roommate, and his friend encouraged Cox to study acting with Stella Adler.

==Career==
In 1949, Cox appeared on the CBS network radio show &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot;, to the great amusement of host Godfrey. The first half of his act was a monologue in a slangy, almost-mumbled punk-kid characterization, telling listeners about his friend Dufo: &quot;What a crazy guy&quot;. The gullible oaf Dufo would take any dares and fall for his gang&#x27;s pranks time after time, and Cox would recount the awful consequences: &quot;Sixteen stitches. What a crazy guy.&quot; Just as the studio audience had reached a peak of laughter, Cox suddenly switched gears, changed characters, and sang a high-pitched version of &quot;The Drunkard Song&quot; (&quot;There is a Tavern in the Town&quot;), punctuated by eccentric yodels. &quot;Wallace Cox&quot; earned a big hand that night, but lost by a narrow margin to The Chordettes; yet he made enough of a hit to record his radio routine for an RCA Victor single. The &quot;Dufo&quot; routine (&quot;What a Crazy Guy&quot;) was paired with &quot;Tavern in the Town&quot;.

He appeared in Broadway musical reviews, night clubs, and early television comedy-variety programs between 1949 and 1951, including the short-lived (January–April 1949) DuMont series &quot;The School House&quot; and CBS Television&#x27;s &quot;Faye Emerson&#x27;s Wonderful Town&quot;. He appeared on the &quot;Goodyear Television Playhouse&quot; in 1951, starring in the comedy episode &quot;The Copper&quot; as the titular policeman. Series producer Fred Coe approached Cox about a starring role in a proposed live television sitcom &quot;Mister Peepers&quot;, which he accepted. The show ran on NBC television for three years. During this time, he guest-starred on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Martha Raye Show&quot;.

&quot;Billboard&quot; magazine chronicled Cox&#x27;s spectacular rise in booking fees: in the late 1940s, it was $75 per week at New York&#x27;s Village Vanguard, $125 per week at the Blue Angel; $250 per week in Broadway&#x27;s &quot;Dance Me a Song&quot; revue in 1950, and the Persian Room for $500 per week. The eight-year pact that he signed with NBC in late 1952 paid him $100,000 for 1953.

In 1953, Cox&#x27;s comedy sketches were featured in &quot;The Ford 50th Anniversary Show&quot;, a program that was broadcast live on both NBC and CBS. Cox&#x27;s four sketches consist of a man trying to improve his physique, an expert on relaxation methods, a man practicing techniques that allow him to change from a wallflower to a social hit, and a man learning to dance. The program attracted an audience of 60 million viewers. Forty years after the broadcast, television critic Tom Shales recalled it as both &quot;a landmark in television&quot; and &quot;a milestone in the cultural life of the &#x27;50s&quot;.

In 1959, Cox was featured in the guest-starring title role in &quot;The Vincent Eaglewood Story&quot; on NBC&#x27;s Western series &quot;Wagon Train&quot;. He played a prominent supporting role as Preacher Goodman in &quot;Spencer&#x27;s Mountain&quot; (1963), a Navy sonar operator in &quot;The Bedford Incident&quot; (1964), and a drug-addicted doctor opposite Marlon Brando in the World War II suspense film &quot;Morituri&quot; (1965).

Other roles included the hero of the series &quot;The Adventures of Hiram Holliday&quot;, based on a series of short stories by Paul Gallico and co-starring Ainslie Pryor. He was a regular occupant of the upper left square on the television game show &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, and voiced the animated cartoon character &quot;Underdog&quot;. He also was a guest on the game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and on the pilot episodes of &quot;&quot; and &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot;. Cox made several appearances on &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, as well as &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, &quot;I Spy&quot; and evening talk shows. He played a pickpocket in an episode of &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot;. He also appeared on &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, season five, episode number 140, titled &quot;From Agnes—With Love&quot;.

He played character roles in more than 20 motion pictures and worked frequently as a guest star in television drama, comedy and variety series in the 1960s and early 1970s. These included a supporting role in 20th Century Fox&#x27;s unfinished film &quot;Something&#x27;s Got to Give&quot; (1962), which is Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s last film. He was cast as a down-on-his-luck prospector seeking a better life for his family in an episode of &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;, a Western comedy; and in &quot;Up Your Teddy Bear&quot; (aka &quot;Mother&quot;) (1970), he starred with Julie Newmar. His television and screen persona was that of a shy, timid but kind man who wore thick eyeglasses and spoke in a pedantic, high-pitched voice.

Cox wrote a number of books, including &quot;Mister Peepers: A Sort of Novel&quot;, co-written with William Redfield, which was created by adapting several scripts from the television series; &quot;My Life as a Small Boy&quot;, an idealized depiction of his childhood; a parody and update of Horatio Alger in &quot;Ralph Makes Good&quot;, which was probably originally a screen treatment for an unmade film intended to star Cox; and a children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Tenth Life of Osiris Oakes&quot;.

==Personal life==
In a 1950s article on Cox&#x27;s series &quot;Mister Peepers&quot;, &quot;Popular Science&quot; reported that Cox kept a small workshop in his dressing room. (Cox&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; colleague Peter Marshall recalled in his memoir &quot;Backstage with the Original Hollywood Square&quot; that Cox installed and maintained all the wiring in his own home.)

While he maintained a meek onscreen persona, TV viewers did get a glimpse of Cox&#x27;s physicality on an episode of &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, aired on May 11, 1960, in which he and host Garry Moore ran around the stage assembling furniture while the panel was blindfolded. On the May 15, 1974, installment of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, actor Robert Blake spoke of how much he missed his good friend Cox, who was described as being adventurous and athletic.

A Democrat, Cox supported the campaign of Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election.

Cox married three times—to Marilyn Gennaro, Milagros Tirado, and Patricia Tiernan. He was survived by his third wife and his two children.

Cox and Brando remained close friends throughout Cox&#x27;s life, and Brando appeared unannounced at Cox&#x27;s wake. Brando is also reported to have kept Cox&#x27;s ashes in his bedroom and conversed with them nightly. Their close friendship was the subject of rumors. Brando told a journalist: &quot;If Wally had been a woman, I would have married him and we would have lived happily ever after.&quot; Writer-editor Beauregard Houston-Montgomery said that while under the influence of marijuana, Brando told him that Cox had been the love of his life.

==Death==
Cox was found dead on February 15, 1973, in his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles; he was 48. According to the autopsy, Cox died of a heart attack caused by a coronary occlusion. Initial reports indicated that he wished to have no funeral and that his ashes be scattered at sea. A subsequent report indicated that his ashes were put in with those of Brando and another close friend Sam Gilman, and scattered in Death Valley and Tahiti.

<doc id="477459" wikidata="Q931946" url="?curid=477459" title="Rakia">
<text>Rakia, rakija, rakiya, rachiu or rakı (), is the collective term for fruit spirits (or fruit brandy) popular in the Balkans. The alcohol content of rakia is normally 40% ABV, but home-produced rakia can be stronger (typically 50–80%).

== Etymology ==
Fruit spirits are known by similar names in many languages of the Balkans: ; ; ; ; ; (); .

== Overview ==
Rakia is produced from fermented and distilled fruits, typically plums and grapes, but also apricots, pears, cherries or raspberries. Other fruits less commonly used are peaches, apples, figs, blackberries, and quince. Common flavours are &quot;šljivovica&quot; and &quot;țuică&quot;, produced from plums, &quot;kaysieva&quot;/&quot;kajsija&quot;, produced from apricots, or &quot;grozdova&quot;/&quot;lozova&quot; in Bulgaria, &quot;raki rrushi&quot; in Albania and Kosovo, &quot;lozovača&quot;/&quot;komovica&quot; in Croatia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina all produced from grapes. These are akin to the pomace brandy called zivania in Cyprus.

In Albania, rakia is most commonly made out of grapes in mild climate regions and out of plums (and sometimes out of mulberry, thanë (carnelian cherry), or walnuts) in colder climate areas.

Plum and grape rakia are sometimes mixed with other ingredients, such as herbs, honey, sour cherries and walnuts, after distillation.

Normally, rakia is colorless, unless herbs or other ingredients are added. Some types of rakia are kept in wooden barrels (oak or mulberry) for extra aroma and a golden color.

It is traditionally drunk from special small glasses which hold from 30 to 50 millilitres (1 or 2 fluid ounces).

Greek ouzo (from grape) and tsipouro (from pomace), Turkish rakı (from sun-dried grapes) and arak in Lebanon and Levant region differ from rakia as they are redistilled with herbs (commonly anise). Some tsipouro in Greece is made without anise in the same manner as pomace rakia (or pomace brandy). &quot;Boğma rakı&quot; in Turkey is the common name of the domestic raki which is made from fruits such as grapes, dates, figs, mulberries, or plums. It is essentially similar to rakia in the Balkans.

== By country ==
=== Albania ===
Raki () (a type of rakia) is a traditional drink in Albania. Until the 19th century, meyhanes would serve wine or meze. Rakia is deeply connected to the Albanian tradition and as such it is produced everywhere in Albania and Kosovo, sometimes professionally and sometimes in an artisanal way. Skrapar is a region of Albania known for the production of rakia. Skrapar spirit is typically found in festive ceremonies as a popular alcoholic beverage. Grapes are grown in pergolas that are arranged in tall trees such as oaks and plums. Overall, the Skrapar area produces a strong spirit with an alcohol content of up to 45%. The most famous villages for the production of rakia are Zaberzan, Muzhakë, Rog, and Vendreshë. After the grapes are harvested, they are pressed and collected in wooden barrels. Today, plastic barrels are used. The crushed grape at this stage is called bërsi, and it is left for 25 days, almost a month which is also the right time for fermentation. Proper grape fermentation is also understood by a strong characteristic odor. When this fermentation is achieved, the shoots are ready to produce spirit. The grape shoots are then boiled in tinned and sealed copper pots; the wood used must be oak wood which produces a lot of heat needed to turn the shoots into steam. These vapors then pass through copper pipes which pass through a cold container from where the opposite process is achieved, that of distillation, i.e. the return to liquid state of the vapors. A small nape is placed at the bottom of the tube from which the spirit flows into a glass or plastic container. The spirit is then stored in small glass bottles. Rakia is produced in a similar way in Kosovo, where it is usually served with meze. Rahovec is the best-known producer of rakia in the country and there is an annual festival dedicated to rakia.

=== Bosnia and Herzegovina ===
Rakija (Cyrillic: Ракија) is very popular and widespread in Bosnia and Herzegovina, just like in its neighboring countries. A major contributing factor to the production of rakija in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the diversity and availability of fruit in the valley of the river Drina and the untouched and very often wild nature in the mountains.
The traditional old craft of producing rakija has managed to survive long throughout time and it is still widely practiced. The production of homemade rakija for private use is the most popular.

=== Bulgaria ===

Bulgaria cites an old piece of pottery from the 14th century in which the word &quot;rakiya&quot; () is inscribed. The inscription on it reads: “I have celebrated with rakija.” The country has taken measures to declare the drink as a national drink in the European Union to allow lower excise duty domestically but has yet yielded no concrete results. During an archaeological study, Bulgarian archaeologists discovered an 11th-century fragment of a distillation vessel used for the production of rakiya. Due to the age of the fragment, contradicting the idea that rakiya production only began in the 16th century, some historians believe this indicates that rakiya did originally come from Bulgaria. The EU recognizes 12 brands of Bulgarian rakiya through the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) marks, which protect the name of products from a specific region that follow a traditional production process.

=== Croatia ===

Rakija is the most popular spirit in Croatia. Travarica (herbal rakija) is usually served at the beginning of the meal, together with dried figs. The Croatian Adriatic coast is known for a great variety of herbal rakija, some typical for only one island or group of islands. The island Hvar is famous for rakija with the addition of Myrtus (&quot;mrtina&quot;—bitter and dark brown). Southern islands, such as Korčula, and the city of Dubrovnik are famous for rakija with anise (&quot;aniseta&quot;), and in central Dalmatia the most popular rakija is rakija with walnuts (&quot;orahovica&quot;). It&#x27;s usually homemade, and served with dry cookies or dried figs. In the summer, it&#x27;s very typical to see huge glass jars of rakija with nuts steeping in the liquid on every balcony, because the process requires the exposure of orahovica to the sun. In the northern Adriatic—mainly Istria—rakija is typically made of honey (&quot;medica&quot;) or mistletoe (&quot;biska&quot;). Biska, which is yellow-brown and sweet, is a typical liquor of Istria. In the interior of the country a spirit called šljivovica (shlivovitza) is made from plums, and one called viljamovka (viliam-ovka) is made from Williams pears.
Croatia has EU Protected Geographical Indication of 6 rakija products (Zadarski maraschino, Hrvatska travarica, Hrvatski pelinkovac, Hrvatska stara šljivovica, Slavonska šljivovica and Hrvatska loza).

=== Greece ===
In Greece, the most popular traditional Cretan spirit is known as tsikoudia (Greek: &quot;τσικουδιά&quot;). On the mainland, a similar spirit called tsipouro (Greek: &quot;τσίπουρο&quot;) is prevalent. Both tsikoudia and tsipouro are informally referred to as &quot;raki&quot; due to the Ottoman-era nomenclature when &quot;raki&quot; was a generic term describing distilled liquors, a term which informally remains in use today.

Cretan tsikoudia is a pomace brandy made by single distilling grapes after most of their juice has been extracted to produce wine and having left them to ferment in barrels. Special permits are given from late October until the end of November to produce tsikoudia at home in Cretan villages. Unlike tsipouro, tsikoudia is not twice distilled and does not contain anise. It is commonly served cold as an apéritif with seafood and meze, usually referred to as &quot;rakomezedes&quot;, or as a complimentary digestif with spoon sweets or fruit after a meal.

Tsikoudia is an integral element of the island’s culture, identified by many as &quot;the national drink of Crete&quot; and linked to hospitality.

When offered, one should never deny a glass of it. Rakomelo (Greek: &quot;ρακόμελο&quot;) is also a popular spirit made by combining tsikoudia with honey (Greek: &quot;μέλι&quot;) and several spices, such as cinnamon, cardamom, or other regional herbs.

=== North Macedonia ===
Rakija () is one of the most popular spirits in North Macedonia, with the most common types are yellow and white grape rakija. Tikves winery makes the most famous rakija which is made in Kavadarci. A lot of people in North Macedonia make homemade white rakija with natural process from grape distillate and add anise which gives sweetness. In industrial production, the percentage of alcohol in rakija is between 40 and 45 percent, but in domestic production, this percentage can be more than 60.

=== Romania and Moldova ===
In Romania and Moldova, the related word &quot;rachiu&quot; or &quot;rachie&quot; is used to refer to a similar alcoholic beverage as these neighboring countries, often a strong fruit-based spirit, usually from grapes. However, the more commonly used terms for similar popular beverages are țuică and palincă; țuică in particular is prepared only from plums. Additionally, the regional term &quot;vinars&quot; (literally &quot;burnt-wine&quot;) in Romania, and &quot;divin&quot; in Moldova, can refer to brandy in general as well.

=== Serbia ===
Rakija () is one of the most popular alcoholic drinks in Serbia. It is the national drink of Serbia. According to Dragan Đurić, President of the Association of Producers of Natural Spirits, the EU protects the names of beverages by allowing the prefix &quot;Serbian&quot;. In Serbia there are 10,000 private producers of rakija. Two thousand are on the official register and only about a hundred cellars produce high-quality spirit. The most popular rakijas in Serbia are: &quot;sljivovica&quot;-it is made from plum, apricot rakija and pear rakija. Belgrade is the site of a Rakija museum. A 14th century Serbian source is the earliest confirmation of Rakija-making.

=== Turkey ===
Raki or rakı (, , , ) is an unsweetened, occasionally (depending on area of production) anise-flavoured, alcoholic drink considered to be a national drink in Turkey. It is popular in Iran, Turkic countries, and in the Balkan countries as an apéritif. It is often served with seafood or meze. It is comparable to several other alcoholic beverages available around the Mediterranean and the Middle East, such as pastis, ouzo, sambuca, arak and aguardiente.

== Serving ==
In Bulgaria, rakiya is generally served with salads, such as shopska salad, pickled vegetables (turshiya), which form the first course of the meal. Muskatova rakiya is made from Muscat grapes, while the preparation method of dzhibrova rakiya is the same as for Italian grappa.

In North Macedonia it often served with pristine mountain sheep cheese, variety of salads such as shopska salad cabbage salad, yogurt and cucumber salad, root salads, olives dipped in olive oil, as well as yellow cheese kashkaval and less commonly with pork roast or dried pork meats.

In summer, rakiya is usually served ice cold, while in winter it&#x27;s served &quot;cooked&quot; (Bulgarian: &quot;греяна&quot; (&quot;greyana&quot;), Serbian: &quot;кувана / kuvana&quot; or &quot;грејана / grejana&quot;, Croatian: &quot;kuhana&quot;, rakiya (also called &quot;Šumadija tea&quot; in Serbia). Rakiya is heated and sweetened with honey or sugar, with added spices. Heated in large kettles, it is often offered to visitors to various open-air festivities, especially in winter. It is similar to mulled wine, as weaker brands of rakiya are used (or stronger ones diluted with water).

== Ritual use ==
Although wine is the essential part of the Eucharist rite in the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches in the region, rakia has found uses in certain religious and related rituals across the Balkans.

At the end of the Orthodox Christian burial service, at the exit from the cemetery, visitors are offered a piece of soda bread (&quot;pogača&quot;) and a glass of rakia. When drinking &quot;for the soul&quot; of the deceased, one spills some rakia on the ground, saying &quot;May God receive this for her/him&quot;, before drinking the rest.

During wedding ceremonies, the groom&#x27;s father goes around all tables and offers a glass of rakia to all guests, sharing a toast for the happiness of the newlyweds. In general, in the Balkans, rakia is offered to guests in one&#x27;s home as a welcoming gesture.

It is also used as a sacramental element by the Bektashi Order, and Alevi Jem ceremonies, where it is not considered alcoholic and is referred to as &quot;dem&quot;.

== Types ==
There are many kinds of rakia, depending on the fruit it is produced from:

<doc id="477460" wikidata="Q1064408" url="?curid=477460" title="Woolly lemur">
<text>The woolly lemurs, also known as avahis or woolly indris, are nine species of strepsirrhine primates in the genus &quot;Avahi&quot;. Like all other lemurs, they live only on the island of Madagascar.

The woolly lemurs are the smallest indriids with a body size of and a weight of . Their fur is short and woolly. The body can be grey-brown to reddish, with white on the back of the thighs, with a long, orange tail. The head is round with a short muzzle and ears hidden in the fur.

Woolly lemurs can be found in humid and dry forests, spending most of their time in the leafy copse. Like many leafeaters, they need long naps to digest their food. Woolly lemurs live together in groups of two to five animals, often consisting of parents and several generations of their offspring.

Like all indriids, the woolly lemurs are strictly herbivorous, eating predominantly leaves but also buds and, rarely, flowers.

Males and females live in pairs. Groups consisting of the mating pair and their offspring generally sleep together during the day in tree forks, vine tangles, and dense tree crowns. Although likely, extrapair copulations (which exist in other pair-living nocturnal lemurs, e.g. the Masoala fork-marked lemur (&quot;Phaner furcifer&quot;) and the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (&quot;Cheirogaleus medius&quot;)) have not been demonstrated in &quot;Avahi&quot; species. The gestation period is four to five months, with births usually in September. In the first few months, the young rides on its mother&#x27;s back. After about six months, it is weaned and can live independently after a year, although it will typically live in proximity to its mother for another year. Overall life expectancy is not known.

On November 11, 2005, a research team that discovered a new species of woolly lemur in 1990 in western Madagascar named the species Bemaraha woolly lemur (&quot;Avahi cleesei&quot;), after actor John Cleese, in recognition of Cleese&#x27;s work to save lemurs in the wild. In 2006, a taxonomic revision of eastern avahis based on genetic and morphological analyses led to the identification of two additional species: &quot;A. meridionalis&quot; and &quot;A. peyrierasi&quot;. Further taxonomic revision increased the number of species by adding &quot;A. ramanantsoavanai&quot; and &quot;A. betsileo&quot;. Finally, a new species was discovered in the Masoala peninsula, Moore&#x27;s woolly lemur (&quot;A. mooreorum&quot;).

==Classification==
Nine species are currently recognized:

* Eastern woolly lemur, &quot;Avahi laniger&quot;
* Western woolly lemur, &quot;Avahi occidentalis&quot;
* Sambirano woolly lemur, &quot;Avahi unicolor&quot;
* Bemaraha woolly lemur, &quot;Avahi cleesei&quot;
* Peyrieras&#x27;s woolly lemur, &quot;Avahi peyrierasi&quot;
* Southern woolly lemur, &quot;Avahi meridionalis&quot;
* Ramanantsoavana&#x27;s woolly lemur, &quot;Avahi ramanantsoavanai&quot;
* Betsileo woolly lemur, &quot;Avahi betsileo&quot;
* Moore&#x27;s woolly lemur, &quot;Avahi mooreorum&quot;

<doc id="477471" wikidata="Q203176" url="?curid=477471" title="Gyūdon">
<text>, also known as , is a Japanese dish consisting of a bowl of rice topped with beef and onion, simmered in a mildly sweet sauce flavored with &quot;dashi&quot; (fish and seaweed stock), soy sauce and &quot;mirin&quot; (sweet rice wine). It may sometimes also be served with toppings such as raw or soft poached eggs, &quot;negi&quot; onions, grated cheese or kimchi. A popular food in Japan, it is commonly eaten with &quot;beni shōga&quot; (pickled ginger), &quot;shichimi&quot; (ground chili pepper), and a side dish of miso soup.

== History ==
After the arrival of Buddhism in Japan in the 6th century, consumption of meat became rare in Japanese culture (especially those of four-footed animals such as cattle or pigs) and in many cases frowned upon, both for religious and practical reasons. It was only after the Meiji Restoration in 1868 and the subsequent westernization of the country that meat began to be widely eaten.

&quot;Gyūdon&quot; is considered to be derived from &quot;gyūnabe&quot; (牛鍋), a beef hot pot originating in the Kantō region of eastern Japan. &quot;Gyūnabe&quot; originally consisted of cuts of beef simmered with Welsh onions and miso (as the beef available in Japan at the time were usually of poor quality, the meat was cooked this way to tenderize it and neutralize its foul smell), but by the late 1800s, a variation that used a special stock called &quot;warishita&quot; (割下) – a combination of a sweetener such as sugar or &quot;mirin&quot; and soy sauce – instead of miso and featuring additional ingredients such as &quot;shirataki&quot; (konjac cut into noodle-like strips) and tofu began to appear. This version of &quot;gyūnabe&quot; (known today as &quot;sukiyaki&quot; – originally the name of a similar yet distinct dish from the Kansai region) eventually came to be served with rice in a deep bowl (&quot;donburi&quot;), becoming &quot;gyūmeshi&quot; or &quot;gyūdon&quot;. 
By the 1890s, &quot;gyūmeshi&quot; had already become popular in Tokyo, but was yet unknown in other places such as Kyoto or Osaka. In 1899, Eikichi Matsuda opened the first Yoshinoya restaurant, at the fish market in Tokyo&#x27;s Nihonbashi district. &quot;Gyūdon&quot;, under the moniker &quot;kamechabu,&quot; were also being sold in food stands (&quot;yatai&quot;) in the streets of Ueno and Asakusa.

Originally disparaged as working-class food, &quot;gyūdon&quot; experienced a surge in popularity that transcended class boundaries in the aftermath of the Great Kantō Earthquake of 1923, when it was one of the food items readily available to the citizens of a devastated Tokyo. It was around this time that &quot;gyūdon&quot; evolved further into its present form: a bowl of rice topped with thin slices of beef with onions (&quot;tamanegi&quot;).

Although some establishments still offer &quot;gyūdon&quot; with a &quot;sukiyaki&quot;-like topping (i.e. containing ingredients such as &quot;shirataki&quot; or tofu), the dish as served in most major food chains nowadays simply consist of rice, beef and onions.

== As fast food ==

&quot;Gyūdon&quot; can be found in many restaurants in Japan, and some fast food chains specialize exclusively in the dish. Many of these chain shops are open round the clock. The top three &quot;gyūdon&quot; chains in Japan are Sukiya (currently the largest &quot;gyūdon&quot; chain in Japan, established in Yokohama in 1981), Yoshinoya (the oldest and second largest, established in the Nihonbashi district of what is now Chūō, Tokyo in 1899), and Matsuya (established in Nerima, Tokyo in 1968).

Some of these establishments might refer to &quot;gyūdon&quot; by other names: Matsuya for instance sells &quot;gyūdon&quot; under the name &quot;gyūmeshi&quot; (牛めし), while Hanamaru Udon (はなまるうどん), a chain specializing mainly in Sanuki udon (currently a subsidiary of Yoshinoya), includes what it calls &quot;gyūniku gohan&quot; (牛肉ごはん, lit. &quot;beef rice&quot;) in its menu.

While many establishments charge for miso soup or offer it as a part of a set, Matsuya is known for serving complimentary miso soup for customers who are eating in.

=== Customer specifications ===

There are chains that allow customers to specify how their gyūdon is served with code phrases like &quot;tsuyudaku&quot; (extra broth) at no extra charge. 

&quot;Tsuyudaku&quot;, in regards to gyūdon, is jargon that refers to one kind of specification where the juice and tsuyu mixture is served in large amounts. &quot;Tsuyunuki&quot; is where the amount of tsuyu is specified to be less than usual. Also, the term &quot;tsuyudakudaku&quot; is code for a larger amount of tsuyu.

Sometimes, as with &quot;tsuyudakudakudaku&quot; (&quot;dripping with soupiness&quot;), people will request that the daku, or amount of tsuyu, be exceedingly increased.

One theory says that &quot;daku&quot; comes from the &quot;taku&quot; part of &quot;takusan&quot; (&quot;many, a lot&quot;) which, when doubled as in &quot;daku-daku&quot;, is also the onomatopoeia (imitative word) for the sound of dripping.

The origin of tsuyudaku comes from Japanese businessmen (salaryman) on their morning commute to work who, due to time restrictions, ask for extra soupy gyūdon (&quot;gyūdon tsuyu ome ni&quot;) so that they can eat it quickly.

This trend became so common, that the term &quot;tsuyudaku&quot; quickly spread among proprietors of popular gyūdon chains.

== Ban of US beef ==
As a consequence of the fear of mad cow disease and a ban on imports of beef from the United States, Yoshinoya and most competitors were forced to terminate gyūdon sales in Japan on 11 February 2004. Yoshinoya moved its business to a similar dish made with pork instead of beef, which it named &quot;butadon&quot; (豚丼). Sukiya continued to serve gyūdon (using Australian beef) and also added a dish, &quot;tondon&quot;, equivalent to Yoshinoya&#x27;s &quot;butadon&quot;, to its menu. (&quot;Buta&quot; and &quot;ton&quot; are both Japanese words for &quot;pig&quot; or &quot;pork&quot;, written with the same Kanji, 豚. See tonkatsu, tonjiru.)

The Japanese Diet voted to resume beef imports from the United States in early May 2005, but the ban was reinstated in January 2006 after detectable quantities of prohibited spine tissue were found in the first post-ban shipments arriving in Japan. As the issue was discussed between the United States and Japanese governments, gyūdon vendors and customers waited for a resolution. As of September 2006, the ban has been lifted.

<doc id="477474" wikidata="Q424227" url="?curid=477474" title="Bronchiolitis">
<text>Bronchiolitis is inflammation of the small airways also known as the bronchioles in the lungs. Acute bronchiolitis is caused by a viral infection, usually affecting children younger than two years of age. Symptoms may include fever, cough, runny nose or rhinorrhea, and wheezing. More severe cases may be associated with nasal flaring, grunting, or respiratory distress. If the child has not been able to feed properly due to the illness, signs of dehydration may be present.

Chronic bronchiolitis is more common in adults and has various causes, one of which is bronchiolitis obliterans. Often when people refer to bronchiolitis, they are referring to acute bronchiolitis in children.
Acute bronchiolitis is usually the result of viral infection by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (59.2% of cases) or human rhinovirus (19.3% of cases). Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms. Tests such as a chest X-ray or viral testing are not routinely needed, but may be used to rule out other diseases.
There is no specific medicine that is used to treat bronchiolitis. Symptomatic treatment at home is generally effective and most children do not require hospitalization. This can include antipyretics such as acetaminophen for fever and nasal suction for nasal congestion, both of which can be purchased over the counter. Occasionally, hospital admission for oxygen, particularly high flow nasal cannula, or intravenous fluids is needed in more severe cases of disease. 
About 10% to 30% of children under the age of two years are affected by bronchiolitis at some point in time. It commonly occurs in the winter season in the Northern Hemisphere. It is the leading cause of hospitalizations in those less than one year of age in the United States. The risk of death among those who are admitted to hospital is extremely low at about 1%. Outbreaks of the condition were first described in the 1940s.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Bronchiolitis typically presents in children under two years old and is characterized by symptoms of a respiratory illness.Signs of the disease include:

* fever
* rhinorrhea
* cough
* wheeze
* mild tachypnea or increased breathing

Some signs of severe disease include:
* increased work of breathing (such as use of accessory muscles of respiration, rib &amp; sternal retraction, tracheal tug)
* severe chest wall recession (Hoover&#x27;s sign)
* presence of nasal flaring and/or grunting
* severe tachypnea or increased breathing
* hypoxia (low oxygen levels)
* cyanosis (bluish skin)
* lethargy and decreased activity
* poor feeding (less than half of usual fluid intake in preceding 24 hours)
These symptoms can develop over one to three days. Crackles or wheeze are typical findings on listening to the chest with a stethoscope. Wheezes can occasionally be heard without a stethoscope. The child may also experience apnea, or brief pauses in breathing, but this can occur due to many conditions that are not just bronchiolitis. After the acute illness, it is common for the airways to remain sensitive for several weeks, leading to recurrent cough and wheeze. 

== Causes ==
Bronchiolitis is most commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, also known as human pneumovirus). Other agents that cause this illness include, but are not limited to, human metapneumovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, coronavirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus and mycoplasma. 
=== Risk factors ===
Children are at an increased risk for progression to severe respiratory disease if they have any of the following additional risk factors:
* Preterm infant (gestational age less than 37 weeks)
* Younger age at onset of illness (less than 3 months of age)
* Congenital heart disease
* Immunodeficiency
* Chronic lung disease
* Neurological disorders
* Tobacco smoke exposure

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis is typically made by a provider through clinical history and physical exam. Chest X-ray is sometimes useful to exclude bacterial pneumonia, but not indicated in routine cases. Chest x-ray may also be useful in people with impending respiratory failure. Additional testing such as blood cultures, complete blood count, and electrolyte analyses are not recommended for routine use although may be useful in children with multiple comorbidities or signs of sepsis or pneumonia. Electrolyte analyses may be performed if there is concern for dehydration.

Testing for the specific viral cause can be done but has little effect on management and thus is not routinely recommended. The COVID pandemic has led to more viral testing to exclude COVID as a cause of the infection. At that point providers often also add on a flu and RSV test for completeness. RSV testing by direct immunofluorescence testing of a swab of the nose had a sensitivity of 61% and specificity of 89%, so it is not alway accurate. Identification of those who are RSV-positive can help providers recommend isolation precautions in the hospital or at home to avoid the infection spreading to others. Identification of the virus may help reduce the use of antibiotics because antibiotics are not recommended for viral illnesses such as bronchiolitis.

It is extremely rare for infants to be co-infected with a bacterial illness while having bronchiolitis. Infants with bronchiolitis between the age of two and three months have a second infection by bacteria (usually a urinary tract infection) less than 6% of the time. When further evaluated with a urinalysis, infants with bronchiolitis had an accompanying UTI 0.8% of the time. 

=== Differential diagnosis ===
There are many childhood illnesses that can present with respiratory symptoms, particularly persistent cough, runny nose, and wheezing. Bronchiolitis may be differentiated from some of these by the characteristic pattern of preceding febrile upper respiratory tract symptoms lasting for 1 to 3 days with associated persistent cough, increased work of breathing, and wheezing. However, some infants may present without fever (30% of cases) or may present with apnea without other signs or with poor weight gain prior to onset of symptoms. In such cases, additional laboratory testing and radiographic imaging may be useful. The following are some other diagnoses to consider in an infant presenting with signs of bronchiolitis:
* Upper Respiratory Infection 
* Asthma and reactive airway disease
* Bacterial pneumonia
* Whooping cough
* Foreign body aspiration
* Congenital heart disease
* Allergic reaction
* Vascular ring
* Heart failure
* Cystic fibrosis
* Chronic pulmonary disease

== Prevention ==
Prevention of bronchiolitis relies strongly on measures to reduce the spread of the viruses that cause respiratory infections (that is, handwashing, and avoiding exposure to those symptomatic with respiratory infections). Guidelines are mixed on the use of gloves, aprons, or personal protective equipment.

One way to improve the immune system is to feed the infant with breast milk, especially during the first month of life. Respiratory infections were shown to be significantly less common among breastfed infants and fully breastfed RSV-positive hospitalized infants had shorter hospital stays than non or partially breastfed infants. Guidelines recommend exclusive breastfeeding for infants for the first 6 months of life to avoid infection with bronchiolitis.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has currently approved two RSV vaccines for adults ages 60 and older, Arexvy (GSK plc) and Abrysvo (Pfizer). Abrysvo is also approved for &quot;immunization of pregnant individuals at 32 through 36 weeks gestational age for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) and severe LRTD caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants from birth through 6 months of age.&quot; It is unclear how effective these vaccines will be in preventing infection with bronchiolitis since they are new, although the FDA has approved them due to the clear benefit that they have shown in clinical trials.

Nirsevimab, a monoclonal antibody against RSV, is approved by the FDA for all children younger than 8 months in their first RSV season. Additionally, children aged 8 to 19 months who are at increased risk may be recommended to receive Nirsevimab as they enter their second RSV season if they have increased risk factors for infection with RSV.

A second monoclonal antibody, Palivizumab, can be administered to prevent bronchiolitis to infants less than one year of age that were born prematurely and that have underlying heart disease or chronic lung disease of prematurity. Otherwise healthy premature infants that were born after a gestational age of 29 weeks should not be administered Palivizumab, as the harms outweigh the benefits. 

Tobacco smoke exposure has been shown to increase both the rates of lower respiratory disease in infants, as well as the risk and severity of bronchiolitis. Tobacco smoke lingers in the environment for prolonged periods and on clothing even when smoking outside the home. Guidelines recommend that parents be fully educated on the risks of tobacco smoke exposure on children with bronchiolitis.

== Management ==
Treatment of bronchiolitis is usually focused on the hydration and symptoms instead of the infection itself since the infection will run its course. Complications of bronchiolitis are typically from the symptoms themselves. Without active treatment, cases resolved in approximately eight to fifteen days. Children with severe symptoms, especially poor feeding or dehydration, may be considered for hospital admission. Oxygen saturation under 90%-92% as measured with pulse oximetry is also frequently used as an indicator of need for hospitalization. High-risk infants, apnea, cyanosis, malnutrition, and diagnostic uncertainty are additional indications for hospitalization.

Most guidelines recommend sufficient fluids and nutritional support for affected children along with frequent nasal suctioning. Measures for which the recommendations were mixed include nebulized hypertonic saline, nebulized epinephrine, and chest physiotherapy. Treatments which the evidence does not support include salbutamol, steroids, antibiotics, antivirals, and heliox.

=== Outpatient Management ===

==== Nutrition ====
Maintaining hydration is an important part of management of bronchiolitis. Infants with mild pulmonary symptoms may require only observation if feeding is unaffected. However, oral intake may be affected by nasal secretions and increased work of breathing. Poor feeding or dehydration, defined as less than 50% of usual intake, is often cited as an indication for hospital admission.

==== Breathing/ Oxygen ====
Children must be closely monitored for changes in ability to breathe. Nasal suction can be used at home in order to decrease nasal congestion and open the airways. 

Inadequate oxygen supply to the tissue is one of the main concerns during severe bronchiolitis and oxygen saturation is often closely associated with both the need for hospitalization and continued length of hospital stay in children with bronchiolitis. However, oxygen saturation is a poor predictor of respiratory distress. Accuracy of pulse oximetry is limited in the 76% to 90% range and there is weak correlation between oxygen saturation and respiratory distress as brief hypoxemia is common in healthy infants. Additionally, pulse oximetry is associated with frequent false alarms and parental stress and fatigue.

==== Nasal Suction ====
Infants are nose breathers and bronchiolitis causes congestion of the airways with secretions that can make it difficult to feed and breathe. Nasal suctioning is a very common supportive measure used at home to decrease nasal congestion. It has not been extensively studied in the literature, but can be used to decrease secretions in the nose and has been proven mildly effective in one experimental trial. A nasal suction bulb can be purchased over the counter and directions for its use can be explained by a provider or on the back of the box. Clinical guidelines state that routine suctioning is safe and can provide relief for infants which allows them to eat and sleep more comfortably.

In those same clinical guidelines, it is stated that deep suctioning, which is often performed in the hospital is not recommended as it may lead to increased length of hospital stay in children with bronchiolitis.

=== Inpatient/ Hospital Management ===

==== Nutrition/ Fluid Therapy ====
When children are experiencing poor feeding or dehydration, the child may be admitted to the hospital. Approximately 50% of infants who are hospitalized due to bronchiolitis require fluid therapy. There are two main approaches to fluid therapy: intravenous (IV) fluid therapy and enteral tube fluid therapy (nasogastric or orogastric). Both approaches to fluid therapy are associated with a similar length of hospital stay. Enteral tube fluid therapy may reduce the risk of local complications, but the evidence for or against each approach is not clear. The risk of health care caused hyponatremia and fluid retention are minimal with the use of isotonic fluids such as normal saline.

==== Oxygen ====

If children are having trouble maintaining their oxygen saturations on room air, clinicians may choose to give additional oxygen to children with bronchiolitis if their oxygen saturation is below 90%. Additionally, clinicians may choose to use continuous pulse oximetry in these people to monitor them.

The use of humidified, heated, high-flow nasal cannula may be a safe initial therapy to decrease work of breathing and need for intubation. High flow nasal cannula may still be used in severe cases prior to intubation. The use of CPAP has very limited evidence for improving breathing (a decreased respiratory rate) and does not reduce the need for mechanical ventilation.

Blood gas testing is not routinely recommended for people hospitalized with the disease. However, people with severe worsening respiratory distress or impending respiratory failure may be considered for capillary blood gas testing.

=== Contradicting Evidence ===

==== Hypertonic saline ====
Guidelines recommend against the use of nebulized hypertonic saline in the emergency department for children with bronchiolitis but it may be given to children who are hospitalized.

Nebulized hypertonic saline (3%) has limited evidence of benefit and previous studies lack consistency and standardization. It does not reduce the rate of hospitalization when therapy is given in the emergency department or outpatient setting. A 2017 review found tentative evidence that it reduces the risk of hospitalization, duration of hospital stay, and improved the severity of symptoms. Side effects were mild and resolved spontaneously.

==== Bronchodilators ====
Guidelines recommend against the use of bronchodilators in children with bronchiolitis as evidence does not support a change in outcomes with such use. Additionally, there are adverse effects to the use of bronchodilators in children such as tachycardia and tremors, as well as adding increased cost to the medical visit.

Several studies have shown that bronchodilation with β-adrenergic agents such as salbutamol may improve symptoms briefly but do not affect the overall course of the illness or reduce the need for hospitalization. 

However, there are conflicting recommendations about the use of a trial of a bronchodilator, especially in those with history of previous wheezing. Bronchiolitis-associated wheezing is likely not effectively alleviated by bronchodilators anyway as it is caused by airway obstruction and plugging of the small airway diameters by luminal debris, not bronchospasm as in asthma-associated wheezing that bronchodilators usually treat well. If a clinician is concerned that reactive airway disease or asthma may be a component of the illness, a bronchodilator may be administered. 

Anticholinergic inhalers, such as ipratropium bromide, have a modest short-term effect at best and are not recommended for treatment.

==== Epinephrine ====
The current state of evidence suggests that nebulized epinephrine is not indicated for children with bronchiolitis except as a trial of rescue therapy for severe cases.

Epinephrine is an α and β adrenergic agonist that is used to treat other upper respiratory tract illnesses, such as croup, as a nebulized solution. Current guidelines do not support the outpatient use of epinephrine in bronchiolitis given the lack of substantial sustained benefit.

A 2017 review found inhaled epinephrine with corticosteroids did not change the need for hospitalization or the time spent in hospital. Other studies suggest a synergistic effect of epinephrine with corticosteroids but have not consistently demonstrated benefits in clinical trials. Guidelines recommend against its use currently.

=== Non-effective Treatments ===
* Ribavirin is an antiviral drug which does not appear to be effective for bronchiolitis.
* Antibiotics are often given in case of a bacterial infection complicating bronchiolitis, but have no effect on the underlying viral infection and their benefit is not clear. The risks of bronchiolitis with a concomitant serious bacterial infection among hospitalized febrile infants is minimal and work-up and antibiotics are not justified. Azithromycin adjuvant therapy may reduce the duration of wheezing and coughing in children with bronchiolitis but has not effect on length of hospital stay or duration of oxygen therapy.
* Corticosteroids, although useful in other respiratory disease such as asthma and croup, have no proven benefit in bronchiolitis treatment and are not advised. Additionally, corticosteroid therapy in children with bronchiolitis may prolong viral shedding and transmissibility. The overall safety of corticosteroids is questionable.
* Leukotriene inhibitors, such as montelukast, have not been found to be beneficial and may increase adverse effects.
* Immunoglobulins are of unclear benefit.

=== Experimental Trials ===
Currently other medications do not yet have evidence to support their use, although they have been studied for use in bronchiolitis. Experimental trials with novel antiviral medications in adults are promising but it remains unclear if the same benefit will be present.
* Surfactant had favorable effects for severely critical infants on duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay however studies were few and small.
* Chest physiotherapy, such as vibration or percussion, to promote airway clearance may slightly reduce duration of oxygen therapy but there is a lack of evidence that demonstrates any other benefits. People with difficulty clearing secretions due to underlying disorders such as spinal muscle atrophy or severe tracheomalacia may be considered for chest physiotherapy. 
* Heliox, a mixture of oxygen and the inert gas helium, may be beneficial in infants with severe acute RSV bronchiolitis who require CPAP but overall evidence is lacking. 
* DNAse has not been found to be effective but might play a role in severe bronchiolitis complicated by atelectasis.
* There are no systematic reviews or controlled trials on the effectiveness of nasal decongestants, such as xylometazoline, for the treatment of bronchiolitits.
* Overall evidence is insufficient to support the use of alternative medicine. There is tentative evidence for Chinese herbal medicine, vitamin D, N-acetylcysteine, and magnesium but this is insufficient to recommend their use.

== Epidemiology ==
Bronchiolitis typically affects infants and children younger than two years, principally during the autumn and winter. It is the leading cause of hospital admission for respiratory disease among infants in the United States and accounts for one out of every 13 primary care visits. Bronchiolitis accounts for 3% of emergency department visits for children under 2 years old. Bronchiolitis is the most frequent lower respiratory tract infection and hospitalization in infants worldwide.

=== COVID-19 Pandemic ===
The COVID-19 pandemic rapidly changed the transmission and presentation starting in late 2019. During the pandemic, there was a sharp decrease in cases of bronchiolitis and other respiratory illness, which is likely due to social distancing and other precautions. After social distancing and other precautions were lifted, there was increases in the cases of RSV and bronchiolitis worldwide to varying degrees. There is unclear evidence on how COVID-19 will affect bronchiolitis moving forward. Recent evidence suggests that bronchiolitis still poses a large disease burden to both primary care providers and emergency departments.

<text>Andrew Moray (; ), also known as Andrew de Moray, Andrew of Moray, or Andrew Murray, was a Scots esquire. He rose to prominence during the First Scottish War of Independence, initially raising a small band of supporters at Avoch Castle in early summer 1297 to fight King Edward I of England. He soon had successfully regained control of the north for the absent Scots king, John Balliol. Moray subsequently merged his army with that of William Wallace, and on 11 September 1297 jointly led the combined army to victory at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. He was severely wounded in the course of the battle, dying at an unknown date and place that year.

==Childhood==
Andrew Moray the younger of Petty was born late in the second half of the 13th century. The date and place of his birth are unknown. Andrew&#x27;s father was Sir Andrew Moray of Petty, an influential north Scotland baron and Justiciar of Scotia (1289?–1296), and his mother was the historically anonymous fourth daughter of John Comyn I of Badenoch.

Nothing is known of the formative years of Moray the younger&#x27;s life. In common with other members of his social class, he likely embarked in his youth on the training for knighthood. This would have entailed him being fostered in the household of a mature knight outwith his family, where he would undergo training in horsemanship and in the use of weapons, he would care for the knight&#x27;s armour and weapons, and for his horses. He would also serve the foster-knight meals at the table. It is not recorded that Moray attained knighthood within his lifetime.

==The Morays of Petty&#x27;s place in Scottish society==

The Morays of Petty were a wealthy and politically influential baronial family whose power base was located in the province of Moray in north-east Scotland. The family traced their origins to Freskin of Uphall, in Lothian, who was granted lands in the Laich of Moray during the 12th-century reign of King David I of Scotland. Freskin built a motte-and-bailey castle on these lands at Duffus on the north shore of Loch Spynie (this sea-loch was almost completely drained in the 18th and 19th centuries to bring hundreds of acres of land into agricultural use).

The Morays of Petty possessed significant political influence. The family were loyal agents of the Scots king. Sir Andrew Moray of Petty, head of the north branch of the family, acted from 1289 as the king&#x27;s chief law officer in north Scotland (the Justiciar) and may have been co-opted to the guardianship following in the premature death of King Alexander III. He had close personal connections to the most politically influential family in Scottish society, the Comyns. Sir Andrew&#x27;s first wife was a daughter of John (I) &#x27;the Red&#x27; Comyn of Badenoch, and his second wife was Euphemia Comyn. The Morays of Petty also had links to the Douglases of Douglasdale.

At the outbreak of the Scottish Wars of Independence the Moray family was established in north and south Scotland. Sir Andrew Moray held the lordship of Petty, which was controlled from Hallhill manor on the south bank of the Moray Firth; the lordship of Avoch in the Black Isle, controlled from Avoch Castle situated to the east of Inverness and overlooking the Moray Firth; and the lordship of Boharm in Banffshire, controlled from Gauldwell Castle. Amongst Sir Andrew&#x27;s estates at Petty were lands at Alturile, Brachlie and Croy, and at Boharm were lands at Arndilly and Botriphnie. Andrew Moray the younger was heir to these lands and castles. Sir William Moray of Bothwell, the elder brother of Andrew the younger&#x27;s father, held extensive lands in Lanarkshire and at Lilleford in Lincolnshire. 

Sir William, who was known as &quot;le riche&quot; due to his extensive personal wealth, was in 1296 constructing Bothwell Castle overlooking the River Clyde. Its design was influenced by the latest continental European trends in castle construction, for example Chateau de Coucy. It was clearly intended as an unequivocal statement of his influence and wealth. Moray the younger was also heir to his uncle&#x27;s lands and castles.

The Morays of Petty also had a presence in the Scottish medieval church. A forebear of Moray the younger, also named Andrew, was bishop of Moray early in the 13th century, and an uncle, David Murray, was in the closing years of the thirteenth century a rector of Bothwell church in central Scotland and a canon of Moray. He would subsequently be consecrated in the summer of 1299 as Bishop of Moray by Pope Boniface VIII, and become a vociferous supporter of King Robert I&#x27;s kingship.

== A kingdom in turmoil ==
The late 13th century was a time of upheaval in Scotland. On 19 March 1286, King Alexander III died after apparently being thrown from his horse as he made his way to Kinghorn, in Fife, from Edinburgh Castle to be with his young Flemish queen, Yolande. The Crown passed to his three-year-old granddaughter, Margaret, Maid of Norway, the children of his previous marriage to Margaret, a sister of King Edward I, having predeceased him. The child-queen was never crowned, dying in 1290 during the sea passage to Scotland.

Scots nobles vied for the vacant crown. The Bruces of Annandale had already unsuccessfully attempted in November 1286 to seize it in an armed coup. In this uncertain time, Scotland&#x27;s leaders sought support from King Edward I of England. The price of Edward I&#x27;s involvement in what became known as &#x27;The Great Cause&#x27; was the claimants&#x27; acknowledgement of him as overlord of Scotland. Edward duly presided over a court to assess the merits of these claims. The most serious claims were advanced by John Balliol, the lord of Galloway, and Robert Bruce, lord of Annandale and grandfather of the future king. Balliol was eventually awarded the Crown, and duly swore fealty to Scotland&#x27;s new English overlord, Edward I. This decision was widely accepted by the Scottish political community, including many who had previously supported Bruce.

==Invasion and defeat==

King Edward I became a constant presence in Scottish legal and political affairs. The Scottish political community did not welcome his involvement, and by late 1295 King John had renounced his fealty to the English king and entered into a treaty with France. King Edward was reputedly enraged by such defiance, making hostilities between the kingdoms inevitable.

Andrew Moray the younger was part of the Scottish feudal host assembling at Caddonlee in March 1296 in preparation for war with England. He was likely part of his father&#x27;s retinue. A part of Scottish host, led by the earls of Atholl, Ross, and Mar and John Comyn the younger of Badenoch, entered Cumberland. It marched to Carlisle, destroying, according to The &quot;St. Edmundsbury Chronicle&quot;, 120 villages. More Scots raiders crossed from Jedburgh, burning homes and farms in Northumberland. Pierre de Langtoft, an English chronicler, records:

King Edward I assembled a large army on the Anglo-Scottish border for the invasion of Scotland. By 30 March it was besieging the prosperous Scottish port of Berwick.

Berwick soon fell and was sacked by the English army. The English Lanercost Chronicle condemned this slaughter as a &quot;crime&quot; and recorded that fifteen thousand &quot;of both sexes perished, some by the sword, others by fire, in the space of a day and a half&quot;. 

It had been many years since Scotland had mobilized for war, and at the Battle of Dunbar the Scots were overwhelmed quickly by a detachment led by John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey. The Chronicle of Bury St. Edmunds records the death of eight thousand Scots soldiers at Dunbar.

Scotland now capitulated. Edward I deposed King John at Montrose castle. The symbols of the Scottish kingship were taken from him, including the royal coat of arms which was stripped from his surcoat (thereby earning him the enduring title Toom Tabard, &#x27;Empty Coat&#x27;). King Edward undertook an extended march across Scotland, reaching Elgin on 26 July 1296. He remained in the town&#x27;s castle for a few days, taking the fealty of a number of Scots nobles.

Scots nobles captured at Dunbar were sent to prisons across England. The most important prisoners, such as Sir Andrew Moray of Petty, were taken to the Tower of London. Sir Andrew spent the remainder of his life there, dying on 8 April 1298. Andrew Moray the younger, a prisoner of less significance, was imprisoned in Chester Castle.

==Rebellion==
King Edward&#x27;s English administration in the defeated Scottish kingdom was headed by the Earl of Surrey. Sir Hugh de Cressingham was appointed Treasurer, and Walter Amersham, Chancellor. The Justiciars for Lothian, Scotia (i.e. the territories north of the Forth), and Galloway were English appointees. Most of Scotland&#x27;s former royal castles were held by English nobles. 

English tax collectors began to impose heavy taxes on the Scots, corruptly exploiting the populace to enrich themselves as they collected the king&#x27;s taxes. Cressingham had by the end of May 1297 dispatched £5,188 6s. 8d. to the English treasury. Edward also sought to conscript Scots, including the nobility, into the armies being raised to fight in Flanders. This plan caused widespread alarm across Scotland and further contributed to growing restlessness against English rule.

Scotland may have been easily conquered by King Edward in 1296, but outbreaks of violence soon followed against the English occupiers and their Scots allies. These are usually dated to May 1297. Argyll and Ross were the scenes of earlier violence. In Argyll, Lachlann Mac Ruaidhrí and Ruaidhrí Mac Ruaidhrí were in rebellion, attacking Edward I&#x27;s MacDonald supporters, killing royal officials and destroying royal property. In Galloway the rebels seized English-held castles. There was violence in Aberdeenshire and in Fife, where MacDuff of Fife and his sons led the rising. In Central Scotland, William Hesilrig, the English sheriff of Lanark, was murdered on 3 May 1297, during an attack on the town led by William Wallace and Richard Lundie.
While the Scots suffered under English occupation, Andrew Moray the younger continued to be imprisoned in Chester castle, but sometime in winter 1296–97 he escaped and made his way back to his father&#x27;s lands in north Scotland. He was soon a participant in the uprising against English rule. He raised his standard at Avoch in the first days of May 1297. News of Moray&#x27;s actions drew supporters to him. Sir William fitz Warin, the English constable of Urquhart Castle on the shores of Loch Ness, wrote to King Edward in July 1297: Amongst them were Alexander Pilche, a burgess from Inverness, and a number of burgesses from the town.

King Edward I ordered supporters in Argyll and Ross to assist the Sheriff of Argyll Alexander of the Isles to suppress the rebels. The English Sheriff of Aberdeen, Sir Henry de Latham, was ordered on 11 June 1297 to deal with rebels in Aberdeenshire. Men were dispatched from England, including Henry Percy and Walter Clifford, to suppress the rebellion.

==Attack on Castle Urquhart==
In May 1297 Andrew Moray the younger was leading the rebellion in the province of Moray. King Edward&#x27;s Scots lieutenant in the area was Sir Reginald Cheyne, the sheriff of Elgin. Cheyne was alarmed by the growth of Moray&#x27;s rebellion, writing to the king to request assistance. In response to the king&#x27;s orders to suppress the rebellion, Sir Reginald ordered his subordinates to a meeting at Inverness Castle on 25 May 1297 to discuss how to deal with Moray. One participant was Sir William fitz Warin constable of Urquhart Castle standing on the western shore of Loch Ness.

After this meeting, Sir William fitz Warin returned to his castle accompanied by an escort of men-at-arms. A few miles south of Inverness, he was unsuccessfully ambushed by a force led by Moray and Alexander Pilche. Next day, Sir William found himself besieged in his castle by Moray. The Countess of Ross unexpectedly arrived on the scene with her retinue. The countess, whose husband was held by King Edward in the Tower of London, advised him to surrender. Moray, lacking siege strength, unsuccessfully tried to take the castle in a night attack. He left Sir William to send an account of this mêlee to his king.

== King Edward fights back ==
Although Andrew Moray the younger was thwarted at urquhart Castle, he continued to prosecute a vigorous campaign against his enemies in the province of Moray. The devastation of Sir Reginald Cheyne&#x27;s lands was later reported to King Edward

King Edward I while preparing to campaign in Flanders sought to deal with the threat posed by Andrew Moray by making use of Scots nobles released from his prisons. The king issued orders on 11 June 1297 to several apparently loyal Scots lords to raise their retinues and march into the province of Moray to relieve fitz Warin and restore English authority. They included Henry Cheyne, Bishop of Aberdeen, Sir Gartnait of Mar, heir to the earldom of Mar and whose father was currently held in the Tower of London, and John Comyn, Earl of Buchan and Constable of Scotland, together with his brother, Alexander. The Comyn brothers, related to Moray via his mother, were to remain in the province until the rebellion had been stamped out.

Thewe nobles departed from Aberdeen in early July 1297, and Moray the younger met them on the banks of the River Spey at Enzie, where the road from Aberdeen to Inverness forded the waters of the river, on the eastern edge of the province of Moray. 

An extremely ambiguous account of events at Enzie was sent on 25 August 1297 from Inverness to King Edward by Bishop Cheyn, It relates that after some discussion, Moray and his rebel army withdrew into This was a highly dubious explanation when one considers the Comyn family pacified for the Scots king the province of Moray in the early 13th century. It appears more likely that neither side wished to fight men that they did not consider their enemies. But if Cheyne thought he could save face with this letter, he failed to reckon with Hugh de Cressingham. Cressingham, having seen this letter, wrote to the king on 5 August: 

Cressingham clearly did not believe that the Scots lords tasked with dealing with Moray had done their duty, believing they were playing a double game at King Edward&#x27;s expense. He was especially dismissive of the account of confrontation at the Spey, writing to King Edward:

While Andrew Moray seized control of north Scotland and William Wallace was active in west-central Scotland, a rising led by Scotland&#x27;s traditional feudal leaders was underway in the south of the kingdom. Amongst its leaders were James, the High Steward of Scotland, Robert Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow, and Robert Bruce of Carrick, the future king. Faced with an army led by Henry de Percy and Robert de Clifford, they entered negotiations in June and capitulated at Irvine in July. 

In summer 1297, King Edward proposed to release the younger Moray&#x27;s father, Sir Andrew Moray of Petty, from imprisonment in the Tower to serve in the ranks of the English army in Flanders, if his son was prepared to take his father&#x27;s place as a royal hostage. A safe conduct, allowing him to come to England, was issued under the king&#x27;s seal on 28 August 1297. It is not known if this letter ever reached him, but if it did, it was ignored and his father remained confined in the Tower, dying there on 4 April 1298.

== Battle of Stirling Bridge ==
By late summer 1297, King Edward I had lost control of Scotland. The extent of the breakdown in his rule was described in a letter to him from Cressingham:

Of the castles north of the River Forth, only Dundee remained in English hands. 

In the late summer of 1297, the earl of Surrey finally acted against Moray and Wallace. He was subsequently vilified for this indolence. Walter of Guisborough, said of him: 
Moray and Wallace, besieging Dundee castle, entrusted the siege to the townspeople and marched to Stirling to meet him. They deployed their men to the north of the River Forth, close to the old bridge at Stirling and Stirling Castle. 

Surrey was outmanoeuvred and outfought in the ensuing battle. The key to it was the bridge over the river Forth. Walter of Guisborough said that it was Surrey deployed the vanguard of his army across it. Moray and Wallace struck when only part of the English vanguard had crossed. In the Battle of Stirling Bridge, this vanguard was destroyed. The bulk of Surrey&#x27;s army, which had still not crossed the bridge, fled. Surrey led this flight. He galloped for Berwick, causing one English chronicler, Walter of Guisborough, to sneer that Surrey&#x27;s &quot;charger never once tasted food during the whole journey&quot;.

The casualties of the Scottish army, composed largely of anonymous infantry soldiers, were unrecorded. But there was one recorded casualty: Andrew Moray the younger.

Walter of Guisborough stated that Surrey lost one hundred knights and five thousand infantrymen at Stirling. This is likely an over estimate. The most notable death was Hugh Cressingham. According to the chronicle of Pierre de Langtoft Cressingham, unaccustomed The Lanercost Chronicle claims that Wallace had: 

The defeat of Surrey at the Battle of Stirling Bridge was the zenith of Moray the younger&#x27;s military career. He was no skilled soldier by accident. The training for knighthood that he had received as a baron&#x27;s son equipped him with the skills to fulfil a leadership role in Scotland&#x27;s feudal host.

== Death ==
There is seemingly contradictory evidence about the death of Andrew Moray the younger. Two letters, issued in autumn 1297, appear to indicate he survived for some months after the fighting at Stirling Bridge. The first was sent from Haddington on 11 October 1297 to the mayors of Lübeck and Hamburg, two of the leading towns of the Hanseatic League. It was issued by: The second was issued just under a month later, on 7 November, during a Scottish raid on the northern counties of England. It was received by the prior of Hexham by: Moray&#x27;s name does not appear on any later document.

The inclusion of Moray the younger&#x27;s name in these letters is apparently contradicted by a formal inquisition into the affairs of his recently deceased uncle, Sir William Moray of Bothwell. It was held in Berwick-upon-Tweed in November 1300 and determined that Moray the younger was: &quot;slain at Stirling against the king.&quot; In apparent support of this, no chronicle source places Moray at Hexham or ascribes to him any role in this raid, which Walter Guisborough&#x27;s chronicle says was led by Wallace. The letters issued to the mayors of Lübeck and Hamburg, and to the prior of Hexham, may, for reasons now unknown and unclear to us, have been issued in Moray&#x27;s name but also in his absence.

In response to these apparently conflicting facts, most historians choose to believe that Moray the younger was wounded at Stirling Bridge, later dying of his injuries sometime around November 1297.

== Legacy ==
Andrew Moray the younger&#x27;s early death has meant that his achievements have not been properly recognised. There are neither statues nor monuments to him. Moray&#x27;s deeds are invariably obscured by the greater fame of William Wallace, much of which is attributable to the 11,000-line biographical poem, &quot;The Acts and Deeds of the Illustrious and Valiant Champion Sir William Wallace&quot;, written in the late 15th century reputedly by Scots poet Blind Harry. Nevertheless, in the late 20th century, there was increased recognition of the importance of Moray&#x27;s role in the events of 1297. One historian recently described his actions as &quot;the greatest threat to the English government&quot;.

One legacy that is not in doubt is the birth of his son. At Pentecost (25 May) 1298, Andrew Moray&#x27;s widow bore him a son, also named Andrew. The child eventually acceded to the lordships of Avoch, Boharm, Petty and Bothwell, uniting the north and south branches of the family. He would play a major role in leading the resistance to the attempts of King Edward III of England, grandson of his father&#x27;s foe, Edward I, to conquer Scotland in the 1330s. He was twice appointed Guardian of the Realm during the minority of King David II, the heir of Robert I.

Moray the younger&#x27;s lack of recognition is increasingly a subject of debate, and has even been discussed in the Scotland&#x27;s parliament. In December 2009, Murdo Fraser, a Conservative List MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife, called for a national debate on an appropriate monument to Moray. He stated that it should raise awareness of Moray&#x27;s historical role.

<doc id="477480" wikidata="Q459307" url="?curid=477480" title="Pedro López (serial killer)">
<text>Pedro Alonso López (born 8 October 1948 – disappeared September 1999), also known as The Monster of the Andes, is a Colombian serial killer, child rapist, and fugitive who murdered a minimum of 110 people, mostly young women and girls, from 1969 to 1980. López claimed to have murdered over 300 people. He is considered by many as one of the most prolific serial killers and rapists in history.

==Early life==
Pedro Alonso López was born in Colombia in 1948, in the municipality of Venadillo, Colombia. Pedro López was the seventh of thirteen children born to Benilda López de Castañeda, a laundry worker. Pedro claimed his mother was a prostitute, and had a difficult childhood due to the violence of the household and the absence of a father figure. His father, Megdardo Reyes, was murdered in La Violencia six months before his birth.

López was banished from the house at age eight when his mother caught him attempting to molest his sister. Homeless, López wandered the streets of Bogotá and was frequently sexually abused. After the incident, he joined a gang of street children for protection. At age twelve, he was adopted by an American immigrant family, but fled after a teacher sexually assaulted him.

In 1969, López was sentenced to seven years in prison for auto theft. During this period of incarceration he was raped by three other inmates whom he later killed resulting in his sentence being extended by two years.

==Murders==
Upon his release from prison in 1978, López began wandering throughout the northwestern area of South America, eventually arriving in Peru. He later claimed that during this period he had killed over 100 girls, mainly street children from indigenous tribes. While these claims are unverifiable, it is known that López was briefly captured by an Ayacuchoan indigenous tribe in south-central Peru after attempting to abduct a 9-year-old girl. The Ayacuchoans stripped López of his clothes and belongings and buried him in the sand. However, an American missionary convinced the tribe to release López and turn him over to the police. The police did not detain López, and he was instead expelled from the country.

After his deportation from Peru, López resumed his killing spree, and although authorities began to notice an increase of missing persons, more specifically young girls, throughout areas where he travelled, they concluded the disappearances were most likely cases of human trafficking.

In April 1980, the areas surrounding Ambato, Ecuador were hit by flash flooding, unearthing the remains of several young girls who had been previously reported missing. This revelation prompted the police to reopen their investigations and contributed towards López&#x27;s ultimate arrest later that same year.

==Arrest and confession==
Not long after the flooding, a local woman named Carvina Poveda was on her way to the market with her 12-year-old daughter Marie when López attempted to abduct the girl. Local merchants were able to overpower López and hold him until the police arrived.

While in police custody after his arrest, López initially refused to cooperate during his interrogation, choosing to remain silent. Eventually, he began to confess his crimes to police captain Pastor Cordova, who had been placed in the same cell as him while posing as a prisoner. López boasted that in total, he had murdered &quot;Over two hundred in Ecuador, some tens in Peru, and many more in Colombia&quot;. He described his modus operandi as first luring the victim away from public spaces with a trinket, before raping and strangling them with his bare hands. He additionally claimed that he would occasionally exhume the victim&#x27;s bodies from their burial site and have &quot;tea parties&quot; with them. When asked about his motive for the murders, López reportedly said: &quot;I lost my innocence at age of eight. So I decided to do the same to as many girls as I could.&quot; Soon after his confession, he directed the authorities to the bodies of 53 victims, and his confessions soon led to the confirmation of a total of 110 in Ecuador.

Later in 1980, López was convicted of murder and sentenced to 16 years in prison, the maximum prison sentence available in Ecuador at the time.

==Imprisonment and release==
López served his prison sentence at the Garcia Moreno prison near Quito and was released from prison two years early, on August 31, 1994. In an interview shortly before his release, López described himself as &quot;the man of the century&quot; and said he was being released for &quot;good behavior&quot;. After his release, López was deported to Colombia and was detained as an illegal immigrant on arrival, before being handed over to Colombian authorities. Prosecutors were unable to make a case against him, and he was instead declared insane and admitted into a mental hospital.

In 1998, López was declared sane and released on $70 bail, on the condition that he would periodically report to the authorities; he almost immediately absconded.

The last reported sighting of López was in September 1999, when he visited the National Civil Registry to renew his citizenship card.

In 2002, Colombian National Police and Interpol issued warrants for López&#x27;s arrest over a murder bearing some similarities to his modus operandi. The Interpol warrant was deactivated in 2005, but López remains a fugitive. López has also been named as a possible suspect in a homicide committed in Tunja, Colombia in 2012.

==Coverage==
Editions of &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; up to 2005 credited López as being the &quot;most prolific serial killer&quot;. The listing was removed in newer editions after complaints that it made a competition out of murder.

<doc id="477487" wikidata="Q2356173" url="?curid=477487" title="New Brunswick Route 1">
<text>Route 1 is a highway in the southern part of the Canadian province of New Brunswick. It begins west of the Canada–United States border at St. Stephen, and runs east for to Route 2 at River Glade.

The entire highway is a 4-lane controlled-access freeway. It is one of the most important highways in the province, carrying traffic from the American border in St. Stephen, through the City of Saint John, ending with an interchange with the Trans Canada Highway at River Glade.

==History==
The majority of road development in New Brunswick follows settlement patterns which pre-dated motor transport, thus most communities developed along navigable waterways or were served by railways. The development of controlled access expressways only began in the 1960s and only around the largest communities. The majority of early provincial highway improvements merely consisted of upgrading local roads.

===Early route===
Route 1 initially followed local roads from St. Stephen eastward to Oak Bay where it swung south to the town of St. Andrews, then back north and east (still along local roads) until reaching Saint John where it followed Manawagonish Road through the former city of Lancaster and was later diverted to follow the &quot;Golden Mile&quot; immediately south of Manawagonish Road. It crossed the Saint John River at the Reversing Falls Bridge before proceeding on Douglas Avenue into the north end of the city. From there it went over to Rothesay Avenue and followed the shores of the Kennebecasis River up the valley to Sussex where it ended. Over time, various sections of 2-lane controlled access highway were built to bypass the growing towns and villages, including a long section bypassing the townships of Rothesay and Quispamsis, named the Mackay Highway, having been built through a stretch of timberland formerly owned by the locally prominent Mackay family.

===Saint John Throughway===
The earliest significant upgrade to this routing came in the late 1960s during an urban-renewal project in Saint John which saw the construction of a new highway (the Saint John Throughway) to bypass increased truck traffic around the city. Several alignment options were examined with the majority of citizens wanting the highway to go north of the city through the suburb of Millidgeville from where an easier crossing of the Reversing Falls gorge could be attempted.

However, the city, along with the provincial and federal governments, decided to bargain with the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) to purchase the majority of the Mill Street Yard near the neo-gothic Union Station for a highway alignment which would run through the middle of the city (somewhat like the infamous Interstate 93 alignment which was built through Boston).

The removal of the rail yard and historic station coincided with the federally-controlled &quot;National Harbours Board&quot; building the 4-lane Saint John Harbour Bridge downstream of the Reversing Falls which opened in 1968. Part of this deal involved the NHB collecting a 25¢ toll in each direction, however the toll cannot be raised without federal, provincial and municipal agreement, until 2007 when the toll was increased to 50¢. The new bridge also had the added effect of cutting the upper part of Saint John Harbour off from large ship traffic.

In a related project, in 1969, the federal and provincial governments worked with CPR to revamp the Saint John-Digby ferry service by building a new terminal in the city&#x27;s west end, along with interchanges off the new expressway.

===Mackay Highway===
The Saint John Throughway only extended from Spruce Lake at Lorneville in the west, to where it met the end of the Mackay Highway and Rothesay Avenue in the east at Coldbrook but its construction coincided with the decline of rail traffic and rise of truck traffic and personal automobile travel. The Saint John area soon saw the growth of suburbs in the towns of Rothesay and Quispamsis in the Kennebecasis River valley, which were located just outside the Bay of Fundy&#x27;s &quot;fog belt.&quot;

In the 1970s, the Mackay Highway was upgraded from a 2-lane highway to a 4-lane divided highway, and the controlled-access section of the highway was extended further to accommodate the growing town of Quispamsis.

===Extending controlled access===
In a new focus on improving arterial highways in the province, the provincial government during the 1960s-1980s undertook other improvements to Route 1, namely in building new sections (or designating existing sections) as controlled access. This resulted in the establishment of maximum speed limits of 100 km/h (62 mph) on these sections.

In the mid-1990s, a 2-lane bypass of Hampton was built up the Kennebecasis Valley from where the Mackay Highway ended, rejoining local roads at Valley Waters. Another bypass was built from Oak Bay to Digdeguash to avoid the circuitous routing down the St. Andrews peninsula and through the town of the same name. Further 2-lane bypasses were built around St. George and on the outskirts of Sussex where an interchange with the Trans-Canada Highway was built.

===4-lane construction===
The provincial government changed in 1987 with the election of Premier Frank McKenna who was focused on improving the province&#x27;s business climate. One of the government&#x27;s major tasks was to revamp provincial transportation infrastructure and McKenna entered into aggressive negotiations with the federal government of prime minister Brian Mulroney to secure federal funding of new highway projects. McKenna viewed the Trans-Canada and Route 1 in New Brunswick as being partially a federal responsibility since they funnelled the majority of Atlantic Canada&#x27;s highway traffic to the U.S. and central Canada. The signing of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement in 1989, coupled with federal approval for numerous railway line abandonments in the Maritimes during the 1980s, led to predictions of further highway traffic growth on New Brunswick highways in the 1990s.

Under the remainder of the McKenna administration&#x27;s years of power (until 1997), Route 1 saw 4-lane expansion and upgrading between Lorneville to Lepreau in the west and between Coldbrook and Apohaqui (near Sussex) in the east. A small 4-lane re-alignment was also built between St. George and Pennfield. The Trans-Canada Highway (Route 2) was also upgraded to 4-lanes between Penobsquis and Three Rivers.

Upgrades to Route 1 continued in the late 2000s, with a 4-lane section between St. Stephen and the Route 127 junction at Waweig opening to traffic in December 2008. The St. Stephen Bypass, which had been partially open since 1993 as a 2-lane controlled access route to siphon traffic to the Milltown border crossing, was also upgraded and officially became part of Route 1 at this time. The bypass was completed in November 2009 with the opening of the International Avenue Bridge to Calais, Maine.

It was announced on September 5, 2008 that the remaining stretch of Route 1 that connects to the United States will be twinned. The estimated cost would be $1.2 Billion (including maintenance and not accounting for inflation) with PPP Canada contributing half the cost of construction for an amount estimated to be about $290 million. Work was completed in October 2012. The project was completed in much the same manner as the upgrade and realignment of the Trans-Canada Highway. A private consortium was chosen through a tendering process, and was responsible for the design, and construction for the sections not yet upgraded to 4-lane status. After construction was completed the company formed by the consortium will be responsible for the maintenance of the highway from the US-Canada border crossing, to the interchange with Route 2 at River Glade, 15 km west of Moncton until the year 2040.

On October 25, 2012, the final 8 kilometers of 4-lane highway were opened, completing the project.

===Trans-Canada re-alignment===
The final years of the McKenna administration saw an agreement signed with a private consortium called &quot;Maritime Road Development Corporation&quot; (led by former provincial Liberal leader and former federal Minister of Transport Douglas Young) to privately finance and build a toll highway to carry the Trans-Canada Highway (Route 2) in a new alignment from a point west of Fredericton to a point on the existing TCH west of Moncton at River Glade.

The toll issue was not without controversy as it led to the downfall of McKenna&#x27;s successor, Camille Theriault in 1999 to PC leader Bernard Lord. The highway was built, but tolls were removed from most portions of the highway before they opened and this portion of the privately built (and owned) re-alignment of the Trans-Canada Highway has a hidden toll which is charged to the provincial government, thus motorists do not directly pay for their highway usage.

The new alignment of the Trans-Canada Highway opened in October, 2001 and at this time the portion of the old TCH which ran between River Glade and Sussex was re-designated as part of Route 1, extending the eastern terminus of this highway approximately . Plans called for completion of a 4-lane bypass to replace the old TCH alignment around Sussex and construction took place from 2000–2004. A portion of the old TCH alignment from Sussex toward Fredericton has been re-designated as Route 10 and a re-aligned interchange has been built at Sussex.

===Saint John exit upgrades===

An experiment with Sunbury&#x27;s new A-Trains led to the redesign of highway exit 119. Exit 119-B, west-bound, was widened to allow these longer transport truck configurations to navigate the exit. On the opposite side of the highway, the two east-bound on-ramps were combined into a wider single ramp, again to allow easier navigation for the longer transport trucks to navigate.

An east-bound exit was never officially available at exit 128, as it was only a private truck entrance into Strescon&#x27;s property. In the fall of 2007, this exit was rebuilt into an official exit to allow east-bound traffic access to Rothesay Ave. East-bound traffic can now exit/enter to/from Rothesay Ave (via Ashburn Road) and west-bound traffic can exit/enter to/from Foster Thurston Drive. There is no overpass at this exit.

In December, 2013 the &quot;One Mile House&quot; interchange officially opened after over 4 years of construction with a final price tag of $83 million. This new interchange includes a new 500 m bridge to cross the highway, rail yard, river, and Rothesay Avenue and connects directly to Bayside Drive and Loch Lomond Road, with access to/from Route 100 on Rothesay Avenue. This allows traffic destined for the McAllister and Grandview Industrial Parks and the heavy industrial businesses in that area to get more direct access to Highway 1 and avoid the uptown Saint John streets. The name, &quot;One Mile House&quot;, is derived from the section of Saint John located along the railway 1 mile east of the former Union Station.

<doc id="477489" wikidata="Q1052913" url="?curid=477489" title="Respiratory syncytial virus">
<text>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), also called human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) and human orthopneumovirus, is a virus that causes infections of the respiratory tract. It is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. Its name is derived from the large cells known as &quot;syncytia&quot; that form when infected cells fuse.

RSV is a common cause of respiratory hospitalization in infants, and reinfection remains common in later life, though often with less severity. It is a notable pathogen in all age groups. Infection rates are typically higher during the cold winter months, causing bronchiolitis in infants, common colds in adults, and more serious respiratory illnesses, such as pneumonia, in the elderly and immunocompromised.

RSV can cause outbreaks both in the community and in hospital settings. Following initial infection via the eyes or nose, the virus infects the epithelial cells of the upper and lower airway, causing inflammation, cell damage, and airway obstruction. A variety of methods are available for viral detection and diagnosis of RSV including antigen testing, molecular testing, and viral culture.

Other than vaccination, prevention measures include hand-washing and avoiding close contact with infected individuals. The detection of RSV in respiratory aerosols, along with the production of fine and ultrafine aerosols during normal breathing, talking, and coughing, and the emerging scientific consensus around transmission of all respiratory infections, may also require airborne precautions for reliable protection. In May 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first RSV vaccines, Arexvy (developed by GSK plc) and Abrysvo (Pfizer). The prophylactic use of palivizumab or nirsevimab (both are monoclonal antibody treatments) can prevent RSV infection in high-risk infants.

Treatment for severe illness is primarily supportive, including oxygen therapy and more advanced breathing support with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or nasal high flow oxygen, as required. In cases of severe respiratory failure, intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required. Ribavirin is an antiviral medication licensed for the treatment of RSV in children. RSV infection is usually not serious, but it can be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and in adults, particularly the elderly and those with underlying heart or lung diseases.
==History==
RSV was discovered in 1956 when researchers isolated a virus from a population of chimpanzees with respiratory illness. They named the virus chimpanzee coryza agent (CCA). In 1957, this same virus was identified by Robert M. Chanock in children with respiratory illness. Studies of human antibodies in infants and children revealed that the infection was common in early life. The virus was later renamed human orthopneumovirus, or human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV).

Several other pneumoviruses show great similarity to hRSV. Bovine RSV (bRSV) shares approximately 80% of its genome with hRSV. It also shares hRSV&#x27;s predilection for the young, causing more severe disease in calves less than six months old. Because bRSV-infected calves have almost identical symptoms to hRSV-infected children, they have proven to be an important animal model in RSV research.

==Signs and symptoms==
RSV infection can present with a wide variety of signs and symptoms that range from mild upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) to severe and potentially life-threatening lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) requiring hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. While RSV can cause respiratory tract infections in people of all ages and is among common childhood infections, its presentation often varies between age groups and immune status. Reinfection is common throughout life, but infants and the elderly remain at risk for symptomatic infection.

===Children===
Nearly all children in the United States experience at least one RSV infection before two years of age. Childhood RSV infections are fairly self-limited with typical upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms, such as nasal congestion, runny nose, cough, and low-grade fever. Inflammation of the nasal mucosa (rhinitis) and throat (pharyngitis), as well as redness of the eyes (conjunctival infection), may be seen on exam. Approximately 15–50% of children will go on to develop more serious lower respiratory tracts infections, such as bronchiolitis, viral pneumonia, or croup. Infants are at the highest risk of disease progression.

Bronchiolitis is a common lower respiratory tract infection characterized by inflammation and obstruction of the small airways in the lungs. While several viruses can cause bronchiolitis, RSV is responsible for about 70% of cases. It usually presents with 2 to 4 days of runny nose and congestion followed by worsening cough, noisy breathing, tachypnea (fast breathing), and wheezing. As infants work harder to breathe, they can also show signs of respiratory distress, such as subcostal retractions (when the belly pulls under the ribcage), intercostal retractions (when the muscles between the ribs pull inward), grunting, and nasal flaring. If the child has not been able to feed adequately, signs of dehydration may also be present. Fever may be present, but high-grade fever is uncommon. Crackles and wheezing can often be heard on auscultation, and oxygen saturation levels may be decreased.

In very young infants under six weeks of age, especially premature infants, signs of infection may be less specific. They may have minimal respiratory involvement. Instead, they may exhibit decreased activity, irritability, poor feeding, or breathing difficulties. This can also be accompanied by apneic spells, or brief pauses in breathing.

===Adults===
Reinfection with RSV remains common throughout life. Reinfection in adulthood often produces only mild to moderate symptoms indistinguishable from the common cold or sinus infection. Infection may also be asymptomatic. If present, symptoms are generally isolated to the upper respiratory tract: runny nose, sore throat, fever, and malaise. In most cases, nasal congestion precedes the development of cough. Unlike other upper respiratory infections, RSV is more likely to cause new onset wheeze in adults. About 25% of infected adults will progress to significant lower respiratory tract infections, such as bronchitis or tracheobronchitis.

While RSV very rarely causes severe disease in healthy adults, it can cause morbidity and mortality in the elderly and in those with underlying immune compromise or cardiopulmonary disease. Older adults have a similar presentation to younger adults but tend to have greater symptom severity with an increased risk of lower respiratory tract involvement. In particular, the elderly are more likely to experience pneumonia, respiratory distress, and death.

===Immunocompromised===
In both adults and children, those who are immunocompromised are at an increased risk of severe infection with RSV. Infected individuals in this group are more likely to progress from upper to lower respiratory tract involvement and have prolonged viral shedding. Symptom severity seems closely related to the extent of immune suppression. Those who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), intensive chemotherapy, and lung transplant are particularly susceptible. Bone marrow transplant patients appear to be at the highest risk, especially before marrow engraftment. In this group, RSV infection carries a nearly 80% risk of both pneumonia and death.

=== Elderly ===
RSV or Respiratory syncytial virus affects many populations differently. The most at-risk populations for RSV complications are older adults and those with underlying medical conditions or immunocompromised individuals. Between 60,000-160,000 older adults in the United States are hospitalized annually with RSV. Between 6,000 and 10,000 older adults die from RSV infection each year. Additionally RSV can &quot;... lead to worsening of serious conditions such as, Asthma, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – a chronic disease of the lungs that makes it hard to breathe, and even Congestive heart failure – when the heart can&#x27;t pump enough blood and oxygen through the body.&quot; Expedient and proper medical care is important for older adults as waiting or receiving a misdiagnosis can be associated with an increased risk of complications. As of August 2023, adults aged 60 years and older qualify for vaccination against RSV in Canada and the United States.

===Complications===
==Risk factors==
Risk factors for the development of severe lower respiratory tract infection with RSV vary by population.
== Virology ==
=== Taxonomy ===
RSV is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. The scientific name for this viral species is human orthopneumovirus&quot;.&quot; This is synonymous with human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), which is often shortened to just RSV. It belongs to the genus &quot;Orthopneumovirus,&quot; family &quot;Pneumoviridae&quot;, order &quot;Mononegavirales&quot;. Its name comes from the fact that F proteins on the surface of the virus cause neighboring cell membranes to merge, creating large multinucleated syncytia.

=== Antigenic subtypes ===
RSV is divided into two antigenic subtypes, A and B, based on the reactivity of the F and G surface proteins to monoclonal antibodies. The subtypes tend to circulate simultaneously within local epidemics, although subtype A tends to be more prevalent. Generally, RSV subtype A (RSVA) is thought to be more virulent than RSV subtype B (RSVB), with higher viral loads and faster transmission time. To date, 16 RSVA and 22 RSVB clades have been identified. Among RSVA, the GA1, GA2, GA5, and GA7 clades predominate; GA7 is found only in the United States. Among RSVB, the BA clade predominates worldwide.

=== Genome ===

RSV has a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome. The genome is linear and approximately 15,000 nucleotides in length. It has 10 genes encoding for 11 proteins. The gene order is NS1-NS2-N-P-M-SH-G-F-M2-L, with the NS1 and NS2 gene serving as nonstructural promoter genes.

=== Structure and proteins ===

RSV is a medium-sized (~150 nm) enveloped virus. While many particles are spherical, filamentous species have also been identified. The genome rests within a helical nucleocapsid and is surrounded by matrix protein and an envelope containing viral glycoproteins. There are 11 proteins, described further in the table below.
==== G protein ====

Surface protein G (glycoprotein) is primarily responsible for viral attachment to host cells. This protein is highly variable between strains. G protein exists in both membrane-bound and secreted forms. The membrane-found form is responsible for attachment by binding to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as heparan sulfate, on the surface of host cells. The secreted form acts as a decoy, interacting with antigen-presenting cells to inhibit antibody-mediated neutralization. G protein also contains a CX3C fractalkine-like motif that binds to the CX3C chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) on the surface of ciliated bronchial host cells. This binding may alter cellular chemotaxis and reduce the migration of immune cells into the lungs of infected individuals. G protein also alters host immune response by inhibiting signaling from several toll-like receptors, including TLR4.

==== F protein ====

Surface protein F (fusion protein) is responsible for the fusion of viral and host cell membranes, as well as syncytium formation between viral particles. Its sequence is highly conserved between strains. While viral attachment appears to involve both F and G proteins, F fusion occurs independently of G. F protein exists in multiple conformational forms. In the prefusion state (PreF), the protein exists in a trimeric form and contains the major antigenic site Ø. Ø serves as a primary target of neutralizing antibodies in the body. After binding to its target on the host cell surface (its exact ligand remains unclear), PreF undergoes a conformational change during which Ø is lost. This change enables the protein to insert itself into the host cell membrane and leads to fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. A final conformational shift results in a more stable and elongated form of the protein (postfusion, PostF). Opposite of the RSV G protein, the RSV F protein also binds to and activates toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), initiating the innate immune response and signal transduction.

=== Replication cycle ===
Following the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes, the viral nucleocapsid (containing the viral genome) and the associated viral polymerase are delivered into the host cell cytoplasm. Transcription and translation both occur within the cytoplasm. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase transcribes the genome into 10 segments of messenger RNA (mRNA) which is translated into structural proteins by host cell machinery. During replication of the negative-sense viral genome, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase synthesizes a positive-sense complement called the antigenome. This complementary strand is used as a template to construct genomic negative-sense RNA, which is packaged into nucleocapsids and transported to the plasma membrane for assembly and particle budding.

==Mechanism==

===Transmission===
RSV is highly contagious and can cause outbreaks from both community and hospital transmission. For each person infected with RSV, it is estimated that an average of 5 to 25 uninfected people will become infected. RSV can spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, releasing contaminated droplets into the air. Transmission usually occurs when these droplets come into contact with another person&#x27;s eyes, nose, or mouth. As with all respiratory pathogens once presumed to transmit via respiratory droplets, it is highly likely to be carried by the aerosols generated during routine breathing, talking, and even singing. RSV can also live for up to 25 minutes on contaminated skin (i.e. hands) and several hours on other surfaces like countertops and doorknobs. It has an incubation period of 2 to 8 days. Once infected, people are usually contagious for 3 to 8 days. In infants and in people with weakened immune systems, however, the virus may continue to spread for up to 4 weeks (even after they are no longer showing symptoms).
===Pathogenesis===
Following transmission through the nose or eyes, RSV infects ciliated columnar epithelial cells of the upper and lower airway. RSV continues to replicate within these bronchial cells for about 8 days. After the first several days, RSV-infected cells will become more rounded and ultimately slough into the smaller bronchioles of the lower airway. This sloughing mechanism is also thought to be responsible for the spread of the virus from the upper to lower respiratory tract. Infection causes generalized inflammation within the lungs, including the migration and infiltration of inflammatory cells (such as monocytes and T-cells), epithelial necrosis, edema, and increased mucous production. Inflammation and cell damage tend to be patchy rather than diffuse. Together, the sloughed epithelial cells, mucous plugs, and accumulated immune cells obstruct the lower airway.

=== Reinfection ===

After recovery of &quot;respiratory diseases associated with RSV infection, the virus interferes with the establishment of immunological memory, which leads to recurrent reinfections.&quot; An estimated of &quot;36% of individuals&quot; can be reinfected with RSV &quot;at least once, during the winter season.&quot; Reinfections like these can be a result of &quot;an initial encounter with RSV&quot; that &quot;fails to initiate adequate humoral and cellular immune responses to generate protective memory lymphocytes.&quot;

RSV reinfection can happen throughout life. As a result, it can cause &quot;winter/early spring epidemics in temperate regions, but synchronization of RSV activity can vary widely&quot; depending on the region that individual lives in. Usually, &quot;unless immunocompromised,&quot; adults have mild symptoms when becoming reinfected. The mild symptoms tend to be restricting upper airways. However, younger individuals are extremely vulnerable to developing &quot;severe symptoms,&quot; which typically involve the lower airways. Since infants have smaller airways than children do, &quot;they might be obstructed by inflammation, edema, and mucus.&quot; This can contribute to developing a &quot;more severe lower respiratory tract illness.&quot; As mentioned, RSV reinfection is frequent among all ages and the type of host response to reinfection can determine &quot;which children will develop persistent wheezing and possibly asthma.&quot; It is possible that the age you are infected with RSV can be a vital factor in &quot;determining the phenotype of airway response to subsequent RSV infection.&quot;

=== Immune escape ===

Genetic variations in viral epitopes and adjacent regions affect protein folding, post-transcriptional modifications, and antigenic processing, influencing B and T cell immunity during viral infections. This alteration in conformation can lead to immune evasion, potentially impacting disease severity, outbreaks, and reinfections. Notably, the variability observed in the G gene, followed by the SH and F genes, suggests a correlation between structural differences in proteins and their immunogenicity. Specifically, the irregular curl and low bond energy of the G protein make it prone to conformational changes, affecting its immunogenicity and potentially modulating the immune response.

Different genotypes of RSV exhibit variations in the structural conformation of key proteins such as G, SH, and F, impacting immune responses. The emergence of novel genotypes like ON1 and BA9 is associated with distinct structural differences, particularly in the G protein, which may contribute to immune evasion. Evidence suggests that RSV glycoprotein G plays a crucial role in immune modulation during infection, affecting cytokine expression and the antiviral response. In addition, positive selection pressure drives the dominance of certain genotypes over others, potentially driven by mutations within specific regions of the G gene.

The F protein is a major target for neutralizing antibodies, but its variability enables viral evasion from neutralization, affecting the efficacy of antibodies like Palivizumab. Cross-reactions between RSV subtypes and genotypes are observed, but immune responses are subtype- or genotype-specific, indicating the impact of gene mutations, particularly in the G protein, on immune evasion. Additionally, differences in cytokine expression and immune cell responses highlight the complexity of immune interactions during RSV infection. Genomic variations in RSV, particularly in proteins like G and F, influence immune responses and contribute to immune evasion. This multifaceted immunomodulatory arsenal likely contributes to RSV&#x27;s ability to cause mild respiratory symptoms in most cases, yet it poses a severe threat to vulnerable populations such as infants and the elderly, potentially leading to life-threatening lung disease characterized by immune dysregulation. RSV has evolved numerous strategies to evade the host&#x27;s antiviral response, with over half of its proteins exerting immunomodulatory effects.

==Diagnosis==

===Laboratory diagnosis===
A variety of laboratory tests are available for the diagnosis of RSV infection. While the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does not routinely recommend the use of lab testing to diagnose RSV bronchiolitis (for which the treatment is largely supportive), confirmation of RSV infection may be warranted in high-risk groups if the result will guide clinical decisions. Common identification techniques include antigen testing, molecular testing, and viral culture.

====Antigen testing====
Antigen testing involves the detection of RSV antigen fragments (or pieces of molecular viral structures), usually from an nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate. This can be accomplished either by viewing fluorescently labeled antigens under a microscope (direct fluorescence assay, or DFA) or using a commercially available rapid antigen detection test (RADT). Overall, antigen testing is highly sensitive in young children (80–90%) but substantially less reliable in older children and adults, who have less viral shedding. Antigen tests are also subject to higher false positive rates outside of the peak RSV season, such as in the summer months. In these scenarios, the use of either viral culture or nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) may aid in an accurate RSV diagnosis.
* Rapid antigen detection tests (RADT) are commonly used as point-of-care testing due to their ease of use and quick turnaround time (as little as 10 minutes). These include both enzyme immunosorbent assays (EIA) and chromatographic immunoassays (CIA).
* Direct fluorescence assay (DFA) allows for direct microscopic examination of virus-infected cells. The sensitivity of DFA testing depends on an adequate specimen.

====Molecular testing====
Molecular assays, such as nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), enable sensitive detection of very small amounts of virus in nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates. NAAT assays such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detect virus-specific genetic material, rather than viral antigens. They have a sensitivity and specificity approaching 100%. However, they tend to be more expensive and require more complex equipment than other testing methods, making them less practical in resource-limited areas. Molecular testing for RSV is not routinely recommended for all people with respiratory symptoms. However, it may be recommended for those at high risk of RSV complications, such as infants, older adults, and people with chronic medical conditions. RT-PCR has a sensitivity of 90-95% and a specificity of 98-99%, while LAMP has a sensitivity of 95-100% and a specificity of 99-100%.
* Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a type of NAAT that allows a very small sample of genetic material to be rapidly amplified into millions of copies for study. PCR is more sensitive than either antigen testing or viral culture. Therefore, it can be used to detect virus in those with lower viral shedding, such as older children and adults. It may also be used to detect the disease earlier in at-risk individuals (such as hospitalized or immunocompromised patients), when the viral burden may still be too low to be identified by traditional techniques. Because of its sensitivity, PCR can also often detect asymptomatic carriers and may remain positive even days after an infection has clinically resolved.
* Multi-pathogen panels are also available, which can detect the presence of multiple viral infections (including RSV) in a single person.

====Viral culture====
In traditional viral culture, a sample of the virus is introduced to different cell lines and allowed to replicate so it can be studied. Benefits of this technique include the ability to perform genetic characterization, strain typing, and antiviral susceptibility testing. However, it is limited by its prolonged turnaround time of 3–7 days, making it less common in patient care and more common in research settings.

====Serologic testing====
Serology (the measurement of virus-specific antibodies in the serum) is not frequently used in RSV diagnosis. The time required for the body to mount a significant serologic response (and demonstrate a significant rise in antibodies that can be detected in serum) is usually not useful in guiding patient care. Up to 30% of patients with documented RSV infection will have negative serology results. As such, this method is generally reserved for research and surveillance studies.

===Imaging findings===

Chest X-ray findings in children with RSV bronchiolitis are generally nonspecific and include perihilar markings, patchy hyperinflation, and atelectasis. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does not recommend routine imaging for children with presumed RSV bronchiolitis because it does not change clinical outcomes and is associated with increased antibiotic use. Chest X-ray is sometimes considered when the diagnosis of bronchiolitis is unclear or when there is an unexpected worsening. In adults with RSV infection, chest films are often normal or demonstrate nonspecific changes consistent with viral pneumonia, such as patchy bilateral infiltrates.

===Differential diagnosis===
The differential diagnosis for individuals presenting with signs and symptoms of upper and lower respiratory tract infection includes other viral infections (such as rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, and influenza) and primary bacterial pneumonia. In children, inhaled foreign bodies and congenital conditions such as cystic fibrosis or asthma are typically considered.

==Prevention==

===General prevention measures===
The main prevention measure is to avoid close contact with infected individuals. Airborne precautions such as respirators, ventilation, and HEPA/high MERV filters, are likely protective against RSV-laden aerosols.

===Vaccines===
There is interest and research in RSV vaccine discovery, given the virus&#x27;s disease burden and the lack of disease-specific therapies. Vaccine development has faced obstacles that have blocked its progress. Among these are infant-specific factors, such as the immature infant immune system and the presence of maternal antibodies, which make infantile immunization difficult.

RSV infection is widespread in early childhood, contributing significantly to the global disease burden. The association between severe childhood infections and subsequent respiratory issues is not fully understood particularly the suggested link between bronchiolitis, recurrent infantile wheezing, and childhood asthma. Unlike other vaccine-preventable respiratory pathogens, RSV has proven challenging for vaccine development. Ongoing efforts focus on creating vaccines that confer durable protection, with field trials eagerly anticipated. Currently, supportive care is the mainstay for treating RSV disease, as effective vaccines and antiviral drugs are awaited. The introduction of antivirals and vaccines, coupled with advanced diagnostic techniques, holds promise for reducing RSV&#x27;s global impact in the coming years. These interventions may alter infection dynamics and weaken RSV&#x27;s hold on communities worldwide.

Potential vaccines being researched fall into five broad categories: live-attenuated, protein subunit, vector-based, virus particle subunit, and messenger RNA. Each targets different immune responses and thus may be better suited to prevent disease in different at-risk groups. Live-attenuated vaccines have shown some success in RSV-naive infants. Other vaccine candidates hope to target vulnerable populations across the lifespan, including pregnant women and the elderly.
The primary pharmaceutical developers, GSK and Pfizer, obtained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for RSV vaccines targeting adults aged 60 and above. GSK&#x27;s Arexvy boasts 94% efficacy against severe and 83% against symptomatic RSV in this age group, while Pfizer&#x27;s Abrysvo is 86% effective against severe symptoms and 67% against symptomatic disease in adults aged 60 and older.

Addressing the more challenging aspect, the need for a newborn vaccine, researchers employed a pregnancy-administered approach to protect infants during the first six months, a critical period for RSV susceptibility. The FDA&#x27;s advisory committee endorsed Pfizer&#x27;s parental RSV vaccine, acknowledging its 82% effectiveness against severe RSV in newborns up to three months and 69% efficacy through six months. While unanimous in favor of efficacy, the committee voted 10 to 4 for safety, with concerns about a slightly higher premature birth rate in the vaccinated group. GSK halted its own trial due to a 38% higher likelihood of premature births in the vaccine group.

In May 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first RSV vaccines, Arexvy (developed by GSK plc) and Abrysvo (Pfizer). Mresvia is an mRNA vaccine that was approved for medical use in the United States in May 2024.

===Immunoprophylaxis===
Historically, RSV-specific intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG) was used to provide passive immunity to prevent RSV infection and hospitalization in the highest-risk infants. This involved monthly administration of RSV-neutralizing antibodies (or immunoglobins) from human donors recovering from the disease. While this transfer of antibodies was reasonably effective in providing short-term immunization to at-risk infants, it was limited by both its intravenous administration and cost.

RSV-IVIG has since been replaced with the use of a monoclonal antibody (MAb) that can be delivered through muscular injection. Palivizumab (Synagis) is a monoclonal antibody directed against the surface fusion (F) protein of the RSV virus. It was licensed in 1998 and is effective in providing temporary prophylaxis against both RSV A and B. It is given by monthly injections, which begin just before the RSV season and are usually continued for five months. Palivizumab has been shown to reduce both hospitalization rates and all-cause mortality in certain groups of high-risk children (such as those with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, and those born preterm). However, its cost limits its use in many parts of the world. More potent derivatives of this antibody have since been developed (including motavizumab) but were associated with considerable adverse events.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP 2014) recommends RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab during RSV season for:
* Infants born at ≤28 weeks 6 days gestational age and &lt;12 months at the start of RSV season
* Infants &lt;12 months old with chronic lung disease of prematurity
* Infants ≤12 months old with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease
* Infants &lt;24 months old with chronic lung disease of prematurity requiring medical therapy

Per AAP guidelines, palivizumab prophylaxis may also be considered in infants with:
* Congenital airway abnormality
* Neuromuscular disorder
* Cystic fibrosis
* Severe immunocompromise
* Recent or upcoming heart transplantation

Nirsevimab (Beyfortus) is another antiviral monoclonal antibody, that has been approved for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in newborns and infants during their first RSV season. Nirsevimab requires only one dose that lasts the entire RSV season, unlike palivizumab, which has to be injected about once a month for up to four times to remain effective. Nirsevimab was approved for medical use in the European Union and the United Kingdom in November 2022, and in Canada in April 2023.

==Treatment==

===Supportive care===
Treatment for RSV infection is focused primarily on supportive care. This may include monitoring a patient&#x27;s breathing or using suction to remove secretions from the upper airway. Supplemental oxygen may also be delivered through a nasal cannula or face mask in order to improve airflow. In severe cases of respiratory failure, intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required to support breathing. If signs of dehydration are present, fluids may also be given orally or through an IV.

Additional supportive treatments have been investigated in infants hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis. These include:
* Nebulized hypertonic saline has been shown to reduce length of hospitalization and reduce clinical severity in infants with viral bronchiolitis. A possible mechanism is reduced airway edema and mucus plugging to decrease airway obstruction.
* Heliox, a mixture of oxygen with helium, may reduce respiratory distress within the first hour of treatment. It works by decreasing airway resistance and easing the work of breathing. However, it has not been shown to affect overall illness outcomes.
* Chest physiotherapy including forced respiratory techniques for infants has not been found to reduce disease severity or yield any other improvement. Evidence supporting other physiotherapy approaches including instrumental physiotherapy and rhinopharyngeal retrograde technique (RRT) is very limited, The effects and any potential use needs further assessment in clinical trials. There is also no evidence to support hypertonic saline therapy combined with chest physiotherapy. There is very weak evidence to suggest that passive slow expiratory technique physiotherapy may contribute to a &quot;mild to moderate&quot; positive change in the severity of bronchiolitis for hospitalized infants, however, the benefit of this approach for infants treated in ambulatory settings is not known.
* Inhaled recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase), an enzyme that digests the DNA that contributes to mucus plugging and airway obstruction, has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes in this group.

===Viral-specific therapies===
* Ribavirin is an antiviral medication licensed for the treatment of RSV in children. It is a guanosine analog that acts by inhibiting viral RNA synthesis and capping. It was approved in 1986 for treatment of RSV infection. However, the use of ribavirin remains controversial due to unclear evidence of efficacy and concerns about toxicity to exposed staff members, as well as cost. As such, treatment guidelines do not make recommendations for its use in children. In adults, ribavirin is used off-label and is generally reserved for the severely immunocompromised, such as those undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplants.
* Presatovir, an experimental antiviral drug, has shown promising results in clinical trials but has not yet been approved for medical use. It acts as a fusion inhibitor by inhibiting the RSV F protein.
* Immunoglobins, both RSV-specific and non-specific, have historically been used for RSV-related illnesses. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of immunoglobins in children with RSV infection.

===Anti-inflammatories===
* Corticosteroids (systemic or inhaled) have not been found to decrease hospitalization length or disease severity in viral bronchiolitis. Their use may also prolong viral shedding, and thus is not commonly recommended. However, the use of oral corticosteroids remains common in adults with RSV-related exacerbation of underlying lung disease.
* Leukotriene inhibitors such as montelukast have been used in the treatment of infants and children with bronchiolitis. However, the evidence supporting their use remains inconsistent with no definitive conclusions on their efficacy.

===Bronchodilators===
Bronchodilators, medications commonly used to treat asthma, are sometimes used to treat the wheezing associated with RSV infection. These medications (such as albuterol or salbutamol) are beta-agonists that relax the muscles of the airways to allow for improved airflow. However, bronchodilators have not been found to improve the clinical severity of infection or the rate of hospitalization among those with RSV infection. Given their limited benefit, plus their adverse event profile, they are not routinely recommended for use in RSV bronchiolitis.

===Antibiotics===
Antibiotic therapy is not appropriate for the treatment of RSV-related bronchiolitis or viral pneumonia. Antibiotics target bacterial pathogens, not viral pathogens such as RSV. However, antibiotics may be considered if there is clear evidence that a secondary bacterial infection has developed. Ear infections may also develop in a small number of infants with RSV bronchiolitis, in which case oral antibiotics may sometimes be used.

Beyond vaccines, AstraZeneca and Sanofi introduced nirsevimab, a prophylactic monoclonal antibody with 75% efficacy against RSV cases in infants under one year. Europe approved nirsevimab in November 2022, and the FDA followed suit in July 2023. Merck&#x27;s clesrovimab, a similar monoclonal antibody, is in late-stage trials.

==Epidemiology==

===Infants and children===
Worldwide, RSV is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and children under the age of 5. The risk of serious infection is highest during the first 6 months of life. Of those infected with RSV, 2–3% will develop bronchiolitis, necessitating hospitalization. Each year, approximately 30 million acute respiratory illnesses and over 60,000 childhood deaths are caused by RSV worldwide. An estimated 87% of infants will have experienced an RSV infection by the age of 18 months, and nearly all children will have been infected by 3 years. In the United States, RSV is responsible for up to 20% of acute respiratory infection hospitalizations in children under the age of 5. However, the vast majority of RSV-related deaths occur in low-income countries that lack access to basic supportive care.

The prophylactic use of palivizumab or nirsevimab (both are monoclonal antibody treatments) can prevent RSV infection in high-risk infants. Passive immunization is available to prevent RSV infection and hospitalization in the highest-risk infants.

A 2024 &quot;JAMA Open&quot; article suggested a rise in sudden unexpected infant deaths (SUID) may be connected to an unusual surge of RSV in 2021. Researchers analyzed over 14,000 SUID cases using CDC records and found that the rate per 100,000 live births increased by 10% between 2019 and 2021. The study revealed that the risk of SUID was highest from June to December 2021, coinciding with an off-season spike in RSV hospitalizations after the virus deviated from its typical winter pattern in 2020.

===Adults===
It is rare for healthy young adults to develop severe illness requiring hospitalization from RSV. However, it is now recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in certain adult populations, including the elderly and those with underlying heart or lung diseases. Its clinical impact among elderly adults is estimated to be similar to that of influenza. Each year, approximately 5–10% of nursing home residents will experience RSV infection, with significant rates of pneumonia and death. RSV is also responsible for 2–5% of adult community-acquired pneumonias.

===Immunocompromised===
In both adults and children, immunosuppression increases susceptibility to RSV infection. Children living with HIV are more likely to develop acute illness and are 3.5 times more likely to require hospitalization than children without HIV. Bone marrow transplant patients before marrow engraftment are at particularly high risk, with RSV accounting for nearly half of the viral infections in this population. This group has also demonstrated mortality rates of up to 80% among those with RSV pneumonia. While infection may occur within the community, hospital-acquired infection is thought to account for 30–50% of cases among immunocompromised individuals.

===Seasonality===
RSV seasonality varies around the world. In temperate climates, infection rates tend to be highest during the cold winter months. This is often attributed to increased indoor crowding and increased viral stability in lower temperatures. In tropical and arctic climates, however, the annual variation is less well-defined and seems to be more prevalent during the rainy season. Annual epidemics are generally caused by the presence of several different viral strains. Subtype A and B viruses will often circulate simultaneously within a specific geographic region, although group A viruses are more prevalent.

== Research ==
A study investigated RSV-specific T cell responses in 55 infants hospitalized for RSV bronchiolitis and found that these responses were similar during both acute illness and recovery, and did not increase after subsequent RSV infections. This suggests that RSV-specific T-cell responses may not prevent reinfection and might not expand effectively in the body after reinfection. However, these cells might be located in specific areas of the lungs and respond more strongly to secondary infection, as seen in animal studies. For instance, a study using mice showed that the &quot;extent of the BALF inflammatory response to reinfection response to reinfection in adulthood is determined by the age at first infection.&quot; The study also discovered that the patterns differ for &quot;neonatal infection primes the host to develop a Th2-biased response.&quot; The exact mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unclear. One possibility is that a lack of IFN-γ production in newborns during their first encounter with RSV, possibly due to an immature immune system, allows for the emergence of a Th2-biased response that persists and can be triggered again during subsequent RSV infections. However, it is improbable that variations solely in IFN-γ levels explain this susceptibility window. IL-13 appears to play a significant role as a regulator in this process. IL-13 is a protein located in the lung. It is a &quot;mediator of allergic asthma&quot; and it is in charge of &quot;regulating eosinophilic inflammation, mucus secretion, and airway hyperresponsiveness.&quot;

SARS-CoV-2 infections, the virus responsible for COVID-19, may lead to a higher risk of infection with RSV. In November 2022, the RSV hospitalization rate for newborns was seven times the rate in 2018. This, combined with increasing influenza circulation, caused the US state of Oregon to declare a state of emergency. The Children&#x27;s Hospital Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics asked US President Joe Biden to declare a state of emergency.

The findings of a 2024 cross-sectional study of 6,248 hospitalized adults with RSV infection suggest that acute cardiac events are common among hospitalized older adults with RSV infection, and are associated with severe clinical outcomes. Nearly a quarter of hospitalized people over 50 with RSV experienced an acute cardiac event (most frequently acute heart failure), including 1 in 12 adults (8.5%) without documented underlying cardiovascular disease. Patients who had acute cardiac events had nearly twice the risk of a severe outcome than patients who did not.

<text>In biochemistry, a metabolite is an intermediate or end product of metabolism.
The term is usually used for small molecules. Metabolites have various functions, including fuel, structure, signaling, stimulatory and inhibitory effects on enzymes, catalytic activity of their own (usually as a cofactor to an enzyme), defense, and interactions with other organisms (e.g. pigments, odorants, and pheromones).

A primary metabolite is directly involved in normal &quot;growth&quot;, development, and reproduction. Ethylene exemplifies a primary metabolite produced large-scale by industrial microbiology.

A secondary metabolite is not directly involved in those processes, but usually has an important ecological function. Examples include antibiotics and pigments such as resins and terpenes etc.

Some antibiotics use primary metabolites as precursors, such as actinomycin, which is created from the primary metabolite tryptophan. Some sugars are metabolites, such as fructose or glucose, which are both present in the metabolic pathways.

Examples of primary metabolites produced by industrial microbiology include:
The metabolome forms a large network of metabolic reactions, where outputs from one enzymatic chemical reaction are inputs to other chemical reactions.

Metabolites from chemical compounds, whether inherent or pharmaceutical, form as part of the natural biochemical process of degrading and eliminating the compounds.
The rate of degradation of a compound is an important determinant of the duration and intensity of its action. Understanding how pharmaceutical compounds are metabolized and the potential side effects of their metabolites is an important part of drug discovery.

<text>Human metapneumovirus (HMPV or hMPV) is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the family &quot;Pneumoviridae&quot; and is closely related to the avian metapneumovirus (AMPV) subgroup C. It was isolated for the first time in 2001 in the Netherlands by using the RAP-PCR (RNA arbitrarily primed PCR) technique for the identification of unknown viruses growing in cultured cells. As of 2016, it was the second most common cause—after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)—of acute respiratory tract illness in otherwise-healthy children under the age of 5 in a large US outpatient clinic.

The peak age of hospitalization for infants with HMPV is between 6 and 12 months, slightly older than the peak of RSV, which is around 2 to 3 months. The clinical features and severity of HMPV are similar to those of RSV. HMPV is also an important cause of disease in older adults and infants.

==Discovery and naming==
Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) was first discovered in 2001 in the Netherlands by Bernadette G. van den Hoogen and her colleagues. HMPV was first detected in the respiratory secretions of 28 young children in the Netherlands and had initially stood out from other common respiratory viruses because the testing methods van den Hoogen and her colleagues had tried using—immunological assays using virus-specific antibodies and PCR-based methods using virus genome-specific primers—were able to test only for known respiratory viruses and, therefore, were unable to identify the novel virus. 

When researchers began applying molecular biology techniques, the genetic characteristics and portions of the genomic sequences of the virus could be identified. These techniques included the randomly primed PCR technique, which obtained the limited sequence data needed to reveal a clear relationship between this new virus and the avian pneumovirus. The new virus, human metapneumovirus, is named for its close relationship to AMPV, indicating its identity as a metapneumovirus and its human host.

==Epidemiology==
HMPV was responsible for 12% of cases of acute respiratory tract illness in otherwise-healthy children in a US outpatient clinic and 15% and 8% of cases (respectively) of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization in children under and over the age of 5 in the United States in 2010–2012. The virus is distributed worldwide and, in temperate regions, has a seasonal distribution generally following that of RSV and influenza viruses during late winter and spring. Serologic studies have shown that by the age of five, virtually all children worldwide have been exposed to the virus. Despite near universal infection during early life, reinfections are common in older children and adults. 

HMPV may cause mild upper respiratory tract infection (e.g., the common cold). However, premature infants, immunocompromised persons, and older adults &gt;65 years are at risk for severe disease and hospitalization. In some studies of hospitalizations and emergency room visits, HMPV is nearly as common and severe as influenza in older adults. HMPV is associated with more severe disease in people with asthma and adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Numerous outbreaks of HMPV have been reported in long-term care facilities for children and adults, causing fatalities.

==Genome==

The genomic organisation of HMPV is similar to RSV; however, HMPV lacks the non-structural genes, NS1 and NS2, and the HMPV antisense RNA genome contains eight open reading frames in slightly different gene order than RSV (viz. 3’-N-P-M-F-M2-SH-G-L-5’). HMPV is genetically similar to the avian metapneumoviruses A, B and in particular type C. Phylogenetic analysis of HMPV has demonstrated the existence of two main genetic lineages termed subtype A and B containing within them the subgroups A1/A2 and B1/B2 respectively. Genotyping based on sequences of the F and G genes showed that subtype B was associated with increased cough duration and increased general respiratory systems compared to HMPV-A.

== Life cycle and reproduction ==
hMPV is estimated to have a 3–6 day incubation period and is often most active during the later winter and spring seasons in temperate climates, overlapping with the RSV and influenza seasons and possibly allowing for repeated infection. , hMPV and its replication cycle were not well understood. Some of the principal steps of hMPV&#x27;s replication cycle were studied with experiments based on the viral life cycles and reproductive measures of the rest of the Paramyxoviridae family.

The first step of the hMPV replication cycle is attachment to the host cell, specifically the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, using the G protein. This G protein contains a hydrophobic region that acts as an uncleaved signal peptide and a membrane anchor to facilitate its binding; however, because recombinant viruses that lack the G protein have still been able to replicate in vitro and in vivo, it seems that attachment via the G protein is not required for rest of the replication cycle.

Next in the cycle is the fusion of the viral and host membranes which is likely mediated by the F protein. Though the fusion mechanism is very similar to that of other Paramyxoviridae family members and involves conformational changes of the F protein, the mechanism for hMPV does not depend on the G protein for fusion like its family members, showing consistency with the previously mentioned idea that the G protein is not necessary for subsequent steps of the hMPV replication cycle. The fusion function of the F protein has been proven by its ability to bind to host cells via integrin αvβ1 using an Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate (RGD) motif, which is speculated to be the trigger for membrane fusion events. 

One main difference between hMPV and other Paramyxoviridae viruses&#x27; fusion mechanisms though is that hMPV&#x27;s fusion events occur at acidic pH levels while other viruses&#x27; fusion events occur at neutral pH levels; however, more research needs to be conducted in this area to get a better understanding of what is different about the hMPV fusion mechanism and why. Although its specific function is uncertain, the presence of the SH glycoprotein does not appear to have any effects on replication kinetics, cytopathic effects, or plaque formation of hMPV.

After fusion, the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) containing negative-sense viral RNA (vRNA) genome is released into the cytoplasm and acts as a template for mRNA and antigenomic cRNA synthesis. From here, most of our knowledge about hMPV transcription is derived from what we already know about RSV and other Paramyxoviridae viruses, including that leader and trailer sequences in the genome are partially complementary and act as promoters for transcription. We see that proteins N, P, and L dissociate from the vRNA and bind to each other to form the polymerase complex so that the genomic RNA can act as a matrix for viral transcription and replication in the cytoplasm. 

The final step in the replication process of hMPV that is relatively certain is the journeying of the envelope glycoproteins (F, G, and SH) to zones of membranous accumulation via the Golgi apparatus to be exposed at the surface of infected cells. This allows infected cells to merge with adjacent cells through the action of viral fusion proteins on the surface, effectively spreading the virus&#x27;s genome. The rest of the replication cycle following RNA and viral protein synthesis are unclear and require further research.

== Virology ==
HMPV infects airway epithelial cells in the nose and lung. HMPV is thought to attach to the target cell via the glycoprotein (G) protein interactions with heparan sulfate and other glycosaminoglycans. The HMPV fusion (F) protein encodes an RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif that engages RGD-binding integrins as cellular receptors, then mediates fusion of the cell membrane and viral envelope in a pH-independent fashion, likely within endosomes. HMPV then induces the response of chemokines and cytokines such as IL-6, IFN-alpha, TNF-alpha, IL-2, and macrophage inflammatory proteins, which in turn leads to peribronchiolar and perivascular infiltration and inflammation.

== Detection ==

The identification of HMPV has predominantly relied on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology to amplify directly from RNA extracted from respiratory specimens. Alternative more cost-effective approaches to the detection of HMPV by nucleic acid-based approaches have been employed and these include: 
# detection of hMPV antigens in nasopharyngeal secretions by immunofluorescent-antibody test
# the use of immunofluorescence staining with monoclonal antibodies to detect HMPV in nasopharyngeal secretions and shell vial cultures
# immunofluorescence assays for detection of hMPV-specific antibodies
# the use of polyclonal antibodies and direct isolation in cultured cells.

==Distribution and hosts==
Though hMPV was first discovered and identified in 2001, serological studies showed that hMPV, or a close relative of it, had already been circulating for at least 50 years. From this information, it is clear that the virus had not just &quot;jumped&quot; from birds, or some other animal reservoir, to humans shortly before its discovery.

, peak infection from hMPV in the northern hemisphere is in late winter and early spring, but it can be found globally across all continents and its distribution is very complex and dynamic. Researchers have found that hMPV is mostly localized and can differ significantly from community to community, allowing for the possibility of the strain in one location one year to be most similar to the strain in a different location the next year. 

This phenomenon has been recorded with the virus strains in Australia in 2001; in France in 2000 and 2002; in Canada in 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002; in Israel in 2002; and in the Netherlands in 2001 all being very closely related based on their F gene sequences. There are at least two major genotypes of hMPV (A and B) that circulate during community outbreaks and each genotype has two of its own, but as of now, it seems that no one strain is dominant over the others and none of them are known to cause varying levels of severity.

HMPV is most likely spread from infected individuals to others through 1. secretions from coughing and sneezing, 2. close personal contact (ex. touching, shaking hands, etc), and 3. touching objects with viruses on them then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes. , development of a reliable antiviral therapy treatment or vaccine to prevent the spread of hMPV has yet to occur, but there does seem to be promising developments in that area. In some vaccine trials, researchers have observed how a live recombinant human parainfluenza virus that contains the hMPV F gene can induce hMPV-specific antibodies and can protect experimental animals from hMPV. 

Another similar study demonstrated how a chimeric bovine/human parainfluenza virus 3 expressing the hMPV F gene allows for neutralizing antibodies against both parainfluenza and hMPV. These experiments have several limitations, including their small-population animal models. Overall, while vaccines and antiviral therapy treatments are in the works, the biggest difficulty that researchers face is the limited data available about the development of hMPV in the natural host.

==Transmission==
It is likely that transmission occurs by contact with contaminated secretions, via droplet, aerosol, or fomite vectors. Hospital-acquired infections with human metapneumovirus have been reported. HMPV has been shown to circulate during fall and winter months with alternating predominance of a single subtype each year.

==Treatment==
No treatment for humans is known . Ribavirin, a medication used to treat RSV, showed effectiveness in an animal model.

American pharmaceutical corporation Moderna conducted a clinical trial for a candidate modRNA vaccine against metapneumovirus. As of October 2019, the vaccine candidate had passed through phase I, with reports that the vaccine is well-tolerated at all dose levels at two months, and provokes an immune response which boosts the production of neutralising antibodies.

==Evolution==

Human metapneumovirus was first reported in 2001 and avian metapneumovirus in the 1970s. There are at least four lineages of human metapneumovirus—A1, A2, B1 and B2. Avian metapneumovirus has been divided into four subgroups—A, B, C and D. Bayesian estimates suggest that human metapneumovirus emerged between 1875 and 1889 and diverged from avian metapneumovirus around 1800.

==2024–2025 outbreak==

The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention published data showing that respiratory infections had risen significantly in the week of 16 to 22 December 2024; human metapneumovirus was linked to 6.2 percent of positive respiratory illness tests and 5.4 percent of respiratory-illness hospitalizations in China, more than COVID-19, rhinovirus, or adenovirus. Kan Biao, the head of the China CDC&#x27;s National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, announced that the rate of HMPV among children ages 14 and under was on the rise in China.

<doc id="477500" wikidata="Q2755412" url="?curid=477500" title="Syrup of ipecac">
<text>Syrup of ipecac (), or simply ipecac, is a drug that was once widely used as an expectorant (in low doses) and a rapid-acting emetic (in higher doses). It is obtained from the dried rhizome and roots of the ipecacuanha plant (&quot;Carapichea ipecacuanha&quot;), from which it derives its name. It is no longer regularly used in medicine.

In particular, the rapidly induced forceful vomiting produced by ipecac was considered for many years to be an important front-line treatment for orally ingested poisons. However, subsequent studies (including a comprehensive 2005 meta-study) revealed the stomach purging produced by ipecac to be far less effective at lowering total body poison concentrations than the adsorption effect of oral activated charcoal (which is effective through the entire gastrointestinal tract and is often coupled with whole bowel irrigation). Ipecac also presents a small risk of overdose (being a mild poison itself) and a major risk of esophagitis and aspiration pneumonia if used to purge corrosive poisons. Having long been replaced (even in the emetic role) by more effective medications, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) now advises that &quot;Ipecac syrup is no longer recommended for routine management of outpatient ingestions of medications or other chemicals.&quot;

Ipecac is commonly made from alcohol extraction of the ipecacuanha plant. The extract is commonly mixed with glycerin, sugar (syrup), and methylparaben. The active ingredients are plant alkaloids, cephaeline, and methyl-cephaeline (emetine).

== Use ==
Ipecac was used in cough mixtures as an expectorant or an emetic from the 18th until the early 20th century. For instance, ipecac and opium were used to produce Dover&#x27;s powder, which was used in syrup form.

In 1965, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the sale of up to one ounce of syrup of ipecac without a prescription. At the time it was approved, its use was recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Association of Poison Control Centers, American Medical Association, and the FDA&#x27;s medical advisory board as a method to induce vomiting &quot;for quick first-aid use in the home, under medical supervision&quot;, for use in cases of accidental poisoning.

Current guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics, however, strongly advise against this and in fact recommend the disposal of any syrup of ipecac present in the home. Many toxicological associations have also issued position papers recommending against its use as a first-line treatment for most ingested poisons, because of a lack of evidence that syrup of ipecac actually helps improve the outcome in cases of poisoning. Moreover, accidental overdose of ipecac can result when administered in the home. When dealing with poisoning cases in the hospital, it became difficult to obtain a differential diagnosis when syrup of ipecac had been administered, as this can add further symptoms.

A 2005 review by a Health Resources and Services Administration-funded scientific panel concluded that vomiting alone does not reliably remove poisons from the stomach. The study suggested that indications for use of ipecac syrup were rare, and patients should be treated by more effective and safer means. Additionally, its potential side effects, such as lethargy, can be confused with the poison&#x27;s effects, complicating diagnosis. The use of ipecac may also delay the use of other treatments (e.g., activated charcoal, whole bowel irrigation, or oral antidotes) or make them less effective.

=== Misuse ===
Ipecac has been used by people with bulimia nervosa as a means to achieve weight loss through induced vomiting. Repeated use in this manner is believed to cause damage to the heart and muscles, which can ultimately result in the user&#x27;s death. 
Misuse of ipecac has been blamed for the death of singer Karen Carpenter in 1983 who suffered from anorexia nervosa. It has also been used as an agent for Münchausen syndrome by proxy.

== Mechanism of action ==
The actions of ipecac are mainly those of major alkaloids, emetine (methylcephaeline) and cephaeline. They both act locally by irritating the gastric mucosa and centrally by stimulating the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone to induce vomiting.

== Discontinuation ==
Ipecac has been found to have minimal health benefits, and is ultimately ineffective at purging the body of poisonous substances. It was initially discontinued due to production costs and lack of raw materials. As the ASHP advises: &quot;Ipecac syrup is no longer recommended for routine management of outpatient ingestions of medications or other chemicals.&quot; Humco and Paddock Laboratories, the last two companies to continue manufacturing ipecac syrup, both stopped production in 2010.

A heavily cited position statement outlines critical details of its effectiveness: 
In experimental studies the amount of marker removed by ipecac was highly variable and diminished with time. There is no evidence from clinical studies that ipecac improves the outcome of poisoned patients and its routine administration in the emergency department should be abandoned. There is insufficient data to support or exclude ipecac administration soon after poison ingestion. Ipecac may delay the administration or reduce the effectiveness of activated charcoal, oral antidotes, and whole bowel irrigation. Ipecac should not be administered to a patient who has a decreased level or impending loss of consciousness or who has ingested a corrosive substance or hydrocarbon with high aspiration potential.

<text>Meskhetian Turks, also referred to as Turkish Meskhetians, Ahiska Turks, and Turkish Ahiskans, (; &quot;Meskhetis turk&#x27;ebi&quot;) are a subgroup of ethnic Turkish people formerly inhabiting the Meskheti region of Georgia, along the border with Turkey. The Turkish presence in Meskheti began with the Ottoman military expedition of 1578, although Turkic tribes had settled in the region as early as the eleventh and twelfth centuries.

Today, the Meskhetian Turks are widely dispersed throughout the former Soviet Union (as well as in Turkey and the United States) due to forced deportations during World War II. At the time, the Soviet Union was preparing to launch a pressure campaign against Turkey, and Joseph Stalin wanted to clear the strategic Turkish population in Meskheti deemed likely to be hostile to Soviet government intentions. In 1944, the Meskhetian Turks were accused of smuggling, banditry and espionage in collaboration with their kin across the Turkish border. Expelled by Joseph Stalin from Georgia in 1944, they faced discrimination and human-rights abuses before and after deportation. Approximately 115,000 Meskhetian Turks were deported to Central Asia and subsequently only a few hundred have been able to return to Georgia as Georgia does not allow repatriation. Those who migrated to Ukraine in 1990 settled in shanty-towns inhabited by seasonal workers.

== Genetics ==
Out of the tested DNA samples of Meskhetian Turks, the most common Y-chromosomal haplogroup among them is Haplogroup J, in the second place is the Y-chromosomal haplogroup G.
The Meskhetian Turks are genetically very close to Georgians. 

==Origins and terms==
Most Meskhetian Turks identify themselves as having descended from Ottoman settlers. Pro-Georgian historiography has traditionally argued that the Meskhetian Turks, who speak the Kars dialect of the Turkish language and belong to the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam, are simply Turkified Meskhetians (an ethnographic subgroup of Georgians) converted to Islam in the period between the sixteenth century and 1829, when the region of Samtskhe–Javakheti (Historical Meskheti) was under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, theory of the Georgian historians is supported by the fact Meskhetian Turks genetically are closely related to Georgians However, the Russian anthropologist and historian Professor Anatoly Michailovich Khazanov has argued against the pro-Georgian narrative and has said that:

However, when making this comparison, Michailovich ignores the period during which the Adjara and Mesheti regions were under Turkish rule. Turkish-Armenian writer Nişanyan explains the loss of the Georgian language by the Meskhetians, although the Adjarians preserved the Georgian language, as follows:

The people of the city of Batumi and the autonomous region of Adjara (and the Borcka-Hopa side of Artvin and the Meydancık valley of Şavşat) are Muslim Georgians, speaking the Adjara dialect. They were subject to Georgia until the 1810s and lived under direct or indirect Christian rule. The people of Ahıska (and Şavşat-Yusufeli, Posof) have lived under Islamic rule for 450 years. They have long spoken Turkish, perhaps intertwined with other elements of Ottoman Islam.

The DNA evidence has corroborated the Georgian thesis as it shows that Meskhetian Turks are genetically very close to Georgians 

Anthropologist Kathryn Tomlinson has pointed out that in Soviet documents about the 1944 deportations of the Meskhetian Turks, the community were referred to simply as &quot;Turks&quot; because of their faith Islam, not only them but also every Muslim of Georgia was referred as Turks and that it was after their second deportation from Uzbekistan that the term &quot;Meskhetian Turks&quot; was invented. According to Ronald Wixman, the term &quot;Meskhetian&quot; only came into use in the late 1950s. Indeed, the majority of the Meskhetian Turks call themselves simply as &quot;Turks&quot; or &quot;Ahiskan Turks&quot; () referring to the region, meaning &quot;Turks of Ahiska Region&quot;. The Meskhetians claim sometimes that the medieval Cumans-Kipchaks of Georgia (Kipchaks in Georgia) may have been one of their possible ancestors. According to historians, it is less likely because part of the Kipchaks left Georgia during the invasion of Mongols, while others joined Mongols.

== History ==
===Ottoman conquest===
By the Peace of Amasya (1555), Meskheti was divided into two, with the Safavids keeping the eastern part and the Ottomans gaining the western part. In 1578, the Ottomans attacked the Safavid possessions in Georgia, which initiated the Ottoman–Safavid War of 1578–1590, and by 1582 the Ottomans were in possession of the eastern (Safavid) part of Meskheti. The Safavids regained control over the eastern part of Meskheti in the early 17th century. However, by the Treaty of Zuhab (1639), all of Meskheti fell under Ottoman control, and it brought an end to Iranian attempts to retake the region.

===Soviet rule===

====1944 deportation from Georgia to Central Asia====
On 15 November 1944, the then General Secretary of CPSU, Joseph Stalin, ordered the deportation of over 115,000 Meskhetian Turks from their homeland, who were secretly driven from their homes and herded onto rail cars. As many as 30,000 to 50,000 deportees died of hunger, thirst and cold and as a direct result of the deportations and the deprivations suffered in exile. The Soviet guards dumped the Meskhetian Turks at rail sidings across a vast region, often without food, water, or shelter.

According to the 1989 Soviet Census, 106,000 Meskhetian Turks lived in Uzbekistan, 50,000 in Kazakhstan, and 21,000 in Kyrgyzstan. As opposed to the other nationalities who had been deported during World War II, no reason was given for the deportation of the Meskhetian Turks, which remained secret until 1968. It was only in 1968 that the Soviet government finally recognised that the Meskhetian Turks had been deported. The reason for the deportation of the Meskhetian Turks was because in 1944 the Soviet Union was preparing to launch a pressure campaign against Turkey. In June 1945 Vyacheslav Molotov, who was then Minister of Foreign Affairs, presented a demand to the Turkish Ambassador in Moscow for the surrender of three Anatolia provinces (Kars, Ardahan and Artvin). As Moscow was also preparing to support Armenian claims to several other Anatolian provinces, war against Turkey seemed possible, and Joseph Stalin wanted to clear the strategic Georgian-Turkish border where the Meskhetian Turks were settled and who were likely to be hostile to such Soviet intentions.

Unlike the other deported Muslim groups, the Meskhetians have not been rehabilitated nor permitted to return to their homeland. In April 1970, the leaders of the Turkish Meskhetian national movement applied to the Turkish Embassy in Moscow for permission to emigrate to Turkey as Turkish citizens if the Soviet government persisted its refusal to allow them to resettle in Meskheti. However, the response of the Soviet government was to arrest the Meskhetian leaders.
====1989 deportation from Uzbekistan to other Soviet countries====

In 1989, riots broke out between the Meskhetian Turks who had settled in Uzbekistan and the native Uzbeks. Nationalist resentments against the Meskhetians who had competed with Uzbeks for resources in the overpopulated Fergana Valley boiled over. Hundreds of Meskhetian Turks were killed or injured, nearly 1,000 properties were destroyed and thousands of Meskhetian Turks fled into exile. The majority of Meskhetian Turks, about 70,000, went to Azerbaijan, whilst the remainder went to various regions of Russia (especially Krasnodar Krai), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Ukraine.

=== Khojaly Massacre ===
Meskhetian Turk refugees who had been persecuted in Central Asia were forcibly relocated to the Azerbaijan where they settled in Khojaly in Nagorno Karabakh before being subsequently massacred along with Azerbaijanis in 1992. According to Thomas de Waal, Khojaly had been the focus of a large resettlement program by the Azerbaijan government in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 

Russian journalist Victoria Ivleva took photos of the town streets strewn with dead bodies of its inhabitants, including women and children. She described Meskhetian Turks from Khojaly who were captured by Armenian militants and she was hit by an Armenian soldier who took her for one of the captives when she was helping a Meskhetian Turk woman falling behind the crowd with four children, one of which wounded, and the other one newly born.

=== Russo-Ukrainian War ===
Around 2,000 Meskhetian Turks have been forced to flee from their homes in Ukraine since May 2014 amid fighting between government forces and pro-Russian separatists. Turkish Meskhetian community representative in the eastern city of Donetsk, Nebican Basatov, said that those who have fled have sought refuge in Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkey and different parts of Ukraine. Over 300 Meskhetian Turks from the Turkish-speaking minority in eastern Ukraine have arrived in eastern Turkey&#x27;s Erzincan province where they will live under the country&#x27;s recently adopted asylum measures.

== Demographics ==
According to the 1989 Soviet Census, there were 207,502 Turks living in the Soviet Union. However, Soviet authorities recorded many Meskhetian Turks as belonging to other nationalities such as &quot;Azeri&quot;, &quot;Kazakh&quot;, &quot;Kyrgyz&quot;, and &quot;Uzbek&quot;. Hence, official censuses do not necessarily show a true reflection of the real population of the Meskhetian Turks; for example, according to the 2009 Azerbaijani census, there were 38,000 Turks living in the country; however, no distinction is made in the census between Meskhetian Turks and Turks from Turkey who have become Azerbaijani citizens, as both groups are classified in the official census as &quot;Turks&quot; or &quot;Azerbaijani&quot;. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees report published in 1999, that 100,000 Meskhetian Turks lived in Azerbaijan and the defunct Baku Institute of Peace and Democracy stated, in 2001, that between 90,000 and 110,000 Meskhetian Turks lived in Azerbaijan, similarly, academic estimates have also suggested that the Turkish Meskhetian community of Azerbaijan numbers 90,000 to 110,000.
More recently, some Meskhetian Turks in Russia, especially those in Krasnodar, have faced hostility from the local population. The Krasnodar Meskhetian Turks have suffered significant human rights violations, including the deprivation of their citizenship. They are deprived of civil, political and social rights and are prohibited from owning property and employment. Thus, since 2004, many Turks have left the Krasnodar region for the United States as refugees. A large number of them, comprising nearly 1300 individuals, is in Dayton, Ohio. They are still barred from full repatriation to Georgia. Apart from that, in Georgia, racism against Meskheti Turks is still prevalent due to differences in beliefs and ethnic tensions.

== Culture ==
===Religion===
Most Meskhetian Turks are Sunni Muslims and a minority are Shiite Muslims.

===Language===
The Meskhetian Turks speak an Eastern Anatolian dialect of Turkish, which hails from the regions of Kars, Ardahan, and Artvin. The Turkish Meskhetian dialect has also borrowed from other languages (including Azerbaijani, Georgian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Russian, and Uzbek) which the Meskhetian Turks have been in contact with during the Russian and Soviet rule.

=== Wedding ===

Meskhetian Turks&#x27; weddings consist of a traditional proposal from the groom&#x27;s parents and if the bride&#x27;s parents accept the proposal, an engagement party, or &quot;Nişan&quot;, is done. Everyone at the &quot;Nişan&quot; is given a ceremonial sweet drink, called &quot;Sharbat&quot;. The actual wedding lasts for two days. On the first day the bride leaves her house and on the second day is when the marriage happens. Before the bride enters her husband&#x27;s house she uses the heel on her shoe to break two plates with her foot and applies honey on the doorway. This tradition serves the purpose of wishing happiness upon the new bride and groom in their marriage. At the end of the wedding, a dance ensues with the men and women dancing separately. Finally, the newlyweds have their last dance which is called the ‘Waltz’ and that completes the wedding.

=== Circumcision ===
The Religious male circumcision Ceremony of the Ahiska Turks, is hold in a big way of Dance, Music, Guests, recitation of the Koran and a special Kirve (Sandek).

<doc id="477505" wikidata="Q252804" url="?curid=477505" title="Halo 2">
<text>Halo 2 is a 2004 first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie and published by Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox console. &quot;Halo 2&quot; is the second installment in the &quot;Halo&quot; franchise and the sequel to 2001&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;&quot;. The game features new weapons, enemies, and vehicles, another player character, and shipped with online multiplayer via Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Live service. In &quot;Halo 2&quot;″s story mode, the player assumes the roles of the human Master Chief and alien Arbiter in a 26th-century conflict between the United Nations Space Command, the genocidal Covenant, and later, the parasitic Flood.

After the success of &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot;, a sequel was expected and highly anticipated. Bungie found inspiration in plot points and gameplay elements that had been left out of their first game, including online multiplayer. A troubled development and time constraints forced cuts to the scope of the game, including the wholesale removal of a more ambitious multiplayer mode, and necessitated a cliffhanger ending to the game&#x27;s campaign mode. Among &quot;Halo 2&quot;″s marketing was an early alternate reality game called &quot;I Love Bees&quot; that involved players solving real-world puzzles. Bungie supported the game after release with new multiplayer maps and updates to address cheating and glitches. The game was followed by a sequel, &quot;Halo 3&quot;, in September 2007.

&quot;Halo 2&quot; was a commercial and critical success and is often listed as one of the greatest video games of all time. The game became the most popular title on Xbox Live, holding that rank until the release of &quot;Gears of War&quot; for the Xbox 360 nearly two years later. &quot;Halo 2&quot; is the best-selling first-generation Xbox game, with more than 8 million copies sold worldwide. The game received critical acclaim, with the multiplayer lauded; in comparison, the campaign and its cliffhanger ending was divisive. The game&#x27;s online component was highly influential and cemented many features as standard in future games and online services, including matchmaking, lobbies, and clans. &quot;Halo 2&quot;″s marketing heralded the beginnings of video games as blockbuster media. A port of the game for Windows Vista was released in 2007, followed by a high-definition remake as part of &quot;&quot; in 2014.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Halo 2&quot; is a shooter game. Players primarily experience gameplay from a first-person perspective, with the viewpoint shifting to third-person for vehicle segments. Players use a combination of human and Covenant weaponry and vehicles to progress through the game&#x27;s levels. Certain weapons can be dual-wielded, allowing the player to trade accuracy, the use of grenades, and melee attacks for raw firepower. The player can carry two weapons at a time (or three if dual-wielding, with one weapon remaining holstered), with each weapon having strengths in different combat situations. Most Covenant weapons, for example, eschew disposable ammo magazines for a contained battery, which cannot be replaced once depleted. However, these weapons overheat if fired continuously. Human weapons are less effective at penetrating shields and require reloading ammunition, but cannot overheat due to prolonged fire. Players can hijack enemy vehicles and quickly assume control of them. The player is equipped with a damage-absorbing shield that regenerates when not taking fire; their health bar is not visible.

The game&#x27;s &quot;Campaign&quot; mode offers options for both single-player and cooperative multiplayer participation. In campaign mode, the player must complete a series of levels that encompass &quot;Halo 2&quot;&#x27;s storyline. These levels alternate between the Master Chief and a Covenant Elite called the Arbiter, who occupy diametrically opposed roles in the story&#x27;s conflict. Aside from variations in storyline, the Arbiter differs from Master Chief only in that his armor lacks a flashlight; instead, it is equipped with a short duration rechargeable form of active camouflage that disappears when the player attacks or takes damage. There are four difficulty levels in campaign mode: Easy, Normal, Heroic, and Legendary. An increase in difficulty will result in an increase in the number, rank, health, damage, and accuracy of enemies; a reduction of duration and an increase in recharge time for the Arbiter&#x27;s active camouflage; a decrease in the player&#x27;s health and shields; and occasional changes in dialogue. Enemy and friendly artificial intelligence is dynamic, and replaying the same encounters repeatedly will demonstrate different behavior.

=== Multiplayer ===
Like &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot;, the Xbox version of &quot;Halo 2&quot; features a multiplayer system that allows players to compete with each other in split-screen and system link modes; in addition, it added support for online multiplayer via Xbox Live. The Xbox Live multiplayer and downloadable content features of the Xbox version of &quot;Halo 2&quot; were supported until the discontinuation of the service in April 2010, with the final multiplayer session concluding May 10, almost a month after the service was officially terminated. Multiplayer for the PC version of the game used Games for Windows – Live. PC multiplayer servers were taken offline in June 2013.

Instead of implementing multiplayer by having players manually join lobbies, as was common in games at the time, &quot;Halo 2&quot; used matchmaking. Players chose the general type of match they want to play, and the game selected the map and gametype and automatically found other players. This &quot;playlist&quot; system automated the process of finding matches to keep a steady flow of games available at all times, and combined a skill-ranking system on top.

== Synopsis ==
=== Setting ===

&quot;Halo 2&quot; takes place in the 26th century. Humanity, under the auspices of the United Nations Space Command or UNSC, have developed faster-than-light slipspace travel and colonized numerous worlds. Human worlds come under attack by a collective of alien races known as the Covenant. Declaring humanity an affront to their gods, the Forerunners, the Covenant begin to obliterate the humans with their superior numbers and technology. After the human planet Reach is destroyed, a single ship, &quot;The Pillar of Autumn&quot;, follows protocol and initiates a random slipspace jump to lead the Covenant away from Earth. The crew discovers a Forerunner ringworld called Halo. Though the Covenant believe Halo&#x27;s activation will lead to divine salvation, the humans discover that the rings are actually weapons of last resort, built by the Forerunners to contain a terrifying parasite called the Flood. The human supersoldier Master Chief Petty Officer John-117 and his AI companion Cortana learn from Halo&#x27;s AI monitor, 343 Guilty Spark, that activation of the Halos will destroy all sentient life in the galaxy to prevent the Flood&#x27;s spread. Instead of activating the ring, Master Chief and Cortana detonate the &quot;Pillar of Autumn&quot;″s engines, destroying the installation and preventing the escape of the Flood. Master Chief and Cortana race back to Earth to warn of an impending invasion by Covenant forces.

=== Plot ===
&quot;Halo 2&quot; opens with the trial of a Covenant Elite commander aboard the Covenant&#x27;s capital city-ship of &quot;High Charity&quot;. For his failure to stop Halo&#x27;s destruction, the Elite is stripped of his rank, branded a heretic, and tortured by Tartarus, the Chieftain of the Covenant Brutes. Spared execution, the Covenant leadership—the High Prophets Truth, Regret, and Mercy—give the Elite the chance to become an Arbiter, a rank given to Elites in times of great crisis or turmoil. As the Arbiter, the Elite quells a rebellion and recovers 343 Guilty Spark.

On Earth, Fleet Admiral Hood commends the Master Chief and Sergeant Avery Johnson for their , with Commander Miranda Keyes accepting a medal on behalf of her deceased father, Captain Jacob Keyes. A Covenant fleet suddenly appears near Earth. In the ensuing battle, a single ship carrying the Prophet of Regret slips through Earth&#x27;s defenses and besieges the African city of New Mombasa. Master Chief assists in repelling the invasion. With his fleet destroyed, Regret makes a hasty slipspace jump, and Keyes, Johnson, Cortana, and the Master Chief follow aboard the UNSC ship &quot;In Amber Clad&quot;. The crew discovers another Halo installation; realizing the danger the ring presents, Keyes sends Master Chief to kill Regret while she and Johnson search for the Index, Halo&#x27;s activation key.

Responding to Regret&#x27;s distress call, &quot;High Charity&quot; and the Covenant fleet arrive at the Halo. After Master Chief kills Regret, the Covenant bombard his location; he falls into a lake, where he is dragged away by tentacles. Regret&#x27;s death triggers discord among the races of the Covenant, as the Prophets give the Brutes the Elites&#x27; traditional role as their honor guard. The Arbiter subdues Johnson and Keyes and retrieves the Index. Tartarus appears and reveals that the Prophets have ordered the annihilation of the Elites, and sends the Arbiter falling down a deep chasm.

The Arbiter meets the Master Chief in the bowels of the Halo, brought together by a Flood creature called the Gravemind. The Gravemind reveals to the Arbiter that the Great Journey is a lie, and sends the two soldiers to different places to stop Halo&#x27;s activation. The Master Chief is teleported to &quot;High Charity&quot; as the Covenant falls into civil war. The Flood-infested &quot;In Amber Clad&quot; crashes into the city, and Cortana realizes that the Gravemind used them as a distraction. As the parasite overruns the city, the Prophet of Mercy is consumed. As for Tartarus, the Prophet of Truth consigns him to Halo with Keyes, Johnson, and Guilty Spark to activate the ring. Master Chief follows Truth aboard a Forerunner ship leaving the city; Cortana remains behind to destroy &quot;High Charity&quot; and Halo if Tartarus succeeds in activating the ring.

On the surface of Halo, the Arbiter joins forces with Johnson and confronts Tartarus in Halo&#x27;s control room. When the Arbiter tries to convince Tartarus that the Prophets have betrayed them, Tartarus instead activates the ring, and a battle ensues. The Arbiter and Johnson kill Tartarus while Keyes removes the Index; the unexpected deactivation sets Halo and all the other rings on standby for remote activation from a place 343 Guilty Spark calls &quot;the Ark.&quot; Meanwhile, Truth&#x27;s ship arrives at Earth, and Master Chief informs Admiral Hood that he is &quot;finishing this fight.&quot;

In a post-credits scene, Gravemind assumes control of &quot;High Charity&quot;. Cortana agrees to answer the Flood intelligence&#x27;s questions.

== Development ==

&quot;Halo&quot; had never been planned as a trilogy, but the critical and commercial success of &quot;Combat Evolved&quot;—selling more than five million copies in three years—made a sequel expected. Xbox general manager J Allard confirmed &quot;Halo 2&quot; was in production at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2002, with a planned release in time for Holiday 2003.

Many at Bungie wanted to make a sequel, building on cut ideas from &quot;Combat Evolved&quot; with a more ambitious follow-up. The added publisher support for a sequel allowed greater leeway and the ability to return to more ambitious ideas lost during &quot;Combat Evolved&quot;″s development. Not satisfied with merely adding back cut content to the sequel, designer Jaime Griesemer recalled that the team &quot;tripled everything,&quot; rebuilding the game engine, changing the physics engine, and prototyping a system for stencil shadow volumes. The game&#x27;s development would suffer from a lack of clear leadership. Early development discussions happened in small, unconnected teams that did not talk with each other. Bungie cofounder and project lead Jason Jones, who had been exhausted shipping &quot;Combat Evolved&quot;, similarly burned out during &quot;Halo 2&quot;″s production. Jones left the project to work on another Bungie game, &quot;Phoenix&quot;, leaving fewer people to work on &quot;Halo 2&quot;. The departure of Bungie&#x27;s cofounder Alex Seropian in 2002 caused additional friction and politics in the workplace where Seropian had once mediated tensions. Artist Robert McLees recalled that Bungie had never had good managers, with creatives simultaneously juggling managerial roles. &quot;This kinda worked when there were 12 of us. It worked less well when there were 30 of us. It collapsed when there were 60 of us,&quot; he said later.

Writer Joseph Staten described the team&#x27;s ambitions thusly:

Then we just plowed ahead, much like we&#x27;d done with &quot;Halo&quot;, with one notable exception. We ordered ourselves a giant sandwich, took a bite but didn&#x27;t realize exactly how big it was before we started in. And we did that across the board, technically, artistically, and story wise. But of course, we didn&#x27;t figure that out until way too late.

Griesemer put it more bluntly: &quot;What&#x27;s the phrase? Putting ten pounds of crap into a five-pound bag? We really tried to cram it too full, and we paid the price.&quot; Lack of communication led to some team members spending time developing assets or content that was duplicative or wasted. McLees recalled he spent two weeks developing a new weapon that was ultimately cut from the game.

An important feature for &quot;Halo 2&quot; was multiplayer using Xbox Live. Multiplayer in &quot;Combat Evolved&quot; was accomplished via System Link and had nearly been scrapped altogether in the rush to complete the game. Most players never played large maps, while a subset greatly enjoyed 16-player action, connecting consoles together with network cables for group play. &quot;We looked at the small set of fans who were able to do this,&quot; said engineering lead Chris Butcher, &quot;and just how much they were enjoying themselves, and asked ourselves if we could bring that to everybody. That would be something really special, really unique.&quot; Initially, &quot;Combat Evolved&quot;″s multiplayer was supposed to involve larger maps and player counts than what shipped, and members of the team wanted to resurrect those plans for &quot;Halo 2&quot;. The smaller multiplayer modes and local split-screen capabilities of the first game would have been removed. Designer Max Hoberman successfully argued against wholesale removal of a successful component from the previous game. He was put in charge of a small team to further develop the small-scale arena multiplayer, while the rest of the team developed a larger &quot;Warfare&quot; mode. Bungie promised in previews that the core of this multiplayer would be squad-based online battles between human Spartans and Covenant Elites, with players able to call in airstrikes. Hoberman&#x27;s pitch for &quot;Halo 2&quot;″s arena multiplayer was to bring the fun of couch multiplayer online. As Hoberman was not an excellent video game player, he wanted to make sure the game remained fun for even lower-skilled players, rather than catering to the very competitive ones. The system of playlist matchmaking and allowing friends to &quot;party up&quot; to play games together were crucial to creating a global community of players.

The story for &quot;Halo 2&quot; grew out of all the elements that were not seen in &quot;Combat Evolved&quot;. Jason Jones organized his core ideas for the sequel&#x27;s story and approached Staten for input. According to Staten, among the elements that did not make it to the finished game was a &quot;horrible scene of betrayal&quot; where Miranda Keyes straps a bomb to the Master Chief&#x27;s back and throws him into a hole in revenge for her father&#x27;s death; &quot;Jason was going through a rather difficult breakup at the time and I think that had something to do with it,&quot; he said. Staten and Griesemer discussed seeing the war from the Covenant perspective, forming the idea to have part of the game told from the perspective of a Covenant warrior known as the Dervish. Late in development, the Dervish became the Arbiter, after legal teams at Microsoft were afraid the game was sending a message about Islam.

In February 2003, Bungie began developing a gameplay demonstration for E3 2003. The demo, which was the first gameplay seen by the public, showcased new enemies and abilities. Many elements of the trailer, however, were not game-ready; the entire graphics engine used in the footage had to be discarded, and the trailer&#x27;s environment never appeared in the final game due to limitations on how big the game environments could be. Elements like vehicle hijacking were entirely scripted, and in order to keep performance at an acceptable level, a Bungie staff member deleted objects from the game as the player passed through. The restructuring of the engine meant that there was no playable build of &quot;Halo 2&quot; for nearly a year, and assets and environments produced by art and design teams could not be prototyped, bottlenecking development. Griesemer recalled that development was &quot;moving backwards&quot;, and after E3 the team realized that much of what the team had worked on for the past two years would have to be scrapped.

In order to ship the game, Bungie began paring back their ambitions for the single- and multiplayer parts of the game. All other Bungie projects, including &quot;Phoenix&quot;, were cancelled, with their teams folded into &quot;Halo 2&quot; to complete the game. The campaign was completely rethought and remained unplayable for more than a year while the multiplayer was being developed. Ultimately, a third act of the game where Master Chief and Arbiter came together on Earth to defeat the Prophets was cut entirely. Staten hoped the resulting cliffhanger would be treated like the end of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. Planned vehicles, such as variants of the Warthog and an all terrain vehicle, were scrapped.

With the single-player mode in trouble, very little had been done with the large Warfare multiplayer mode. Eventually, the entire warfare mode was cut, and Hoberman&#x27;s small team project became the shipping multiplayer suite. Engineer Chris Butcher commented, &quot;For &quot;Halo 2&quot; we had our sights set very high on networking. Going from having no internet multiplayer to developing a completely new online model was a big challenge to tackle all at once, and as a result we had to leave a lot of things undone in order to meet the ship date commitment that we made to our fans.&quot;

As one of Microsoft&#x27;s tentpole games, the publisher had two full-time user experience researchers managing a team of game testers working on the title. The researchers used playtests, surveys, and usability testing to provide Bungie with input on how the game would be received. Feedback of the game&#x27;s matchmaking system was very unfavorable, with the testers preferring the control offered by traditional servers. Researcher John Hopson recalled that while they suggested to Bungie they should change the matchmaking system, the developers remained steadfast their new approach would be better in the real world; Hopson later agreed with their choice, saying that his team had only narrowly avoided ruining the game. To test real-world network conditions, Bungie ran a closed alpha of the multiplayer with 1000 Microsoft employees for five weeks.

Outside of Bungie, &quot;Combat Evolved&quot;″s success had become a problem for &quot;Halo 2&quot;″s development, as the success of the Xbox platform was riding on &quot;Halo&quot;. Microsoft originally pressured Bungie to have the game ready as a launch title for Xbox Live in November 2002, which Bungie employees told them was impossible. At one point, Microsoft executives had a vote over whether to force Bungie to ship the incomplete game, or give them another year of development time. Microsoft Studios head Ed Fries walked out of the vote and threatened to resign to get Bungie the extra time.

Missing the Xbox&#x27;s last holiday season before its successor console, the Xbox 360, shipped was not an option. To hit its new November 9, 2004, release date, Bungie went into the &quot;mother of all crunches&quot; in order to finish the game. &quot;A lot of people sacrificed themselves in ways that you should never have to for your job,&quot; design lead Paul Bertone recalled. He kenneled his dog for nearly two months and slept in the office for the final days of development, while artist Lorraine McLees took her baby to the office after day care ended as she worked the longer hours. Griesemer said that this lack of a &quot;polish&quot; period near the end of the development cycle was the main reason for &quot;Halo 2&quot;″s shortcomings. Butcher retrospectively described &quot;Halo 2&quot;″s multiplayer mode as &quot;a pale shadow of what it could and should have been&quot; due to the tight schedule. About 70 people worked on the game.

===Audio===

&quot;Halo 2&quot;″s soundtrack was composed primarily by Martin O&#x27;Donnell and his musical partner Michael Salvatori, the team that had composed the critically acclaimed music of &quot;Halo&quot;. O&#x27;Donnell noted in composing the music for &quot;Halo 2&quot; that &quot;making a sequel is never a simple proposition. You want to make everything that was cool even better, and leave out all the stuff that was weak.&quot; O&#x27;Donnell made sure that no part of the game would be completely silent, noting &quot;Ambient sound is one of the main ways to immerse people psychologically. A dark room is spooky, but add a creaking floorboard and rats skittering in the walls and it becomes &quot;really&quot; creepy.&quot; &quot;Halo 2&quot;, unlike its predecessor, was mixed to take full advantage of Dolby 5.1 Digital surround sound.

In the summer of 2004, producer Nile Rodgers and O&#x27;Donnell decided to release the music from &quot;Halo 2&quot; on two separate CDs; the first (Volume One) would contain all the themes present in the game as well as music &quot;inspired&quot; by the game; the second would contain the rest of the music from the game, much of which was incomplete, as the first CD was shipped before the game was released. The first CD was released on November 9, 2004, and featured guitar backing by Steve Vai. Additional tracks included various outside musicians, including Steve Vai, Incubus, Breaking Benjamin, and Hoobastank. The &quot;Halo 2 Original Soundtrack: Volume Two&quot; CD, containing the game music organized in suite form, was released on April 25, 2006.

===Promotion===

&quot;Halo 2&quot; was officially announced in September 2002 with a cinematic trailer, scheduled for a Holiday 2003 release. The first major look at the game came with the E3 2003 demo in May; &quot;Halo 2&quot; was Microsoft&#x27;s strongest showing at the event, and some journalists believed the game looked too good to be live gameplay and must have been a scripted cutscene. After delays, the game was shifted to a first-quarter 2004 release, then to Holiday 2004. The final November 9 release date was confirmed at E3 2004, where the game&#x27;s multiplayer was playable on the show floor. Microsoft executive Peter Moore rolled up his sleeve to reveal the date tattooed on his bicep.

Microsoft intended to market &quot;Halo 2&quot; not just as a video game, but as a cultural event. Part of its widespread appeal would come from the social nature of the game&#x27;s multiplayer, but Microsoft also heavily promoted and marketed the game. A trailer for the game was shown in movie theaters, making &quot;Halo 2&quot; the first video game so advertised. Hype for the title was fueled by the press, with Microsoft telling one journalist that their &quot;Halo 2&quot; review would be the most consequential of their career. The marketing heavily focused on Master Chief and the defense of earth, leaving the reveal of the Arbiter as a playable character a surprise.

&quot;Halo 2&quot;″s release was preceded with promotions and product tie-ins. There was a &quot;Halo 2&quot; Celebrity Pre-Release Party at E3 2004, in which a private home was transformed to replicate the world of &quot;Halo&quot;, complete with camouflaged Marines and roaming Cortanas. Launch events were held worldwide, with players waiting for hours in a line that stretched two blocks in Times Square, New York City. The French version of the game leaked on the internet in October, and circulated widely.

In addition to more traditional forms of promotion, &quot;Halo 2&quot; was also part of an elaborate Alternate Reality Game project titled &quot;I Love Bees&quot;. Microsoft approached 42 Entertainment&#x27;s Elan Lee, who had helped launch the Xbox with Microsoft, on producing a tie-in game. &quot;I Love Bees&quot; cost an estimated one million dollars. The game centered on a hacked website, supposedly a site about beekeeping, where an AI from the future was residing. The project garnered significant attention, drawing attention away from the ongoing 2004 U.S. Presidential Election. The game won an award for creativity at the 5th annual Game Developers Choice Awards and was nominated for a Webby award. Ultimately, nearly 3 million people participated in the game.

&quot;Halo 2&quot; was sold in a standard edition and &quot;Limited Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;. The Collector&#x27;s Edition includes the game, packaged in a metal case. It also includes bonus content on an extra DVD, such as a making-of documentary, art gallery, and audio tests. The instructional booklet is also written from the Covenant point of view rather than from the UNSC point of view used in the regular edition.

===Sales===
&quot;Halo 2&quot; first released on November 9, 2004, in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. Anticipation for the game was high; a record 1.5 million copies were pre-ordered three weeks before release. Massive lines formed at midnight releases of the game at more than 7000 stores across North America and attracted significant media attention. This was followed by releases on November 10, 2004, in France and parts of Europe, and November 11 in the UK, Japan, and elsewhere; the game released in eight languages and a total of 27 countries.

The game sold 2.4 million copies and earned up to US$125 million in its first 24 hours on store shelves, outgrossing the film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; as the highest-grossing release in entertainment history. The game sold 260,000 units in the United Kingdom in its first week, making it the third fastest-selling title in that territory. It ultimately received a &quot;Double Platinum&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 600,000 copies in the United Kingdom. In the United States, it was the second best-selling game of 2004 (after &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;) with sales of that year, and the eighteenth best-selling game of the 2000s decade.

On release, &quot;Halo 2&quot; was the most popular video game on Xbox Live, holding that rank until the release of &quot;Gears of War&quot; for the Xbox 360 nearly two years later. In the first ten weeks of release, players collectively logged 91 million hours playing the game; by June 2006, more than 500 million games of &quot;Halo 2&quot; had been played, and more than 710 million hours logged on Xbox Live. Over five million players had played by 2007. &quot;Halo 2&quot; is the best-selling first-generation Xbox game with at least 6.3 million copies sold in the United States and 8.46 million copies in total.

== Reception ==
&quot;Halo 2&quot; received critical acclaim upon release. On review aggregate site Metacritic, the Xbox version has an overall score of 95 out of 100. Critics judged it a worthy successor to the acclaimed &quot;Combat Evolved&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Greg Kasavin wrote that the game successfully built on its predecessor&#x27;s foundation, and despite shortcomings, the game&#x27;s breadth of content made it one of the best action games available.
The game&#x27;s audiovisual presentation was praised. Multiplayer especially was noted in being the best on Xbox Live at the time. &quot;Game Informer&quot;, along with numerous other publications, rated it higher than &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot;, citing enhanced multiplayer and less repetitive gameplay. Most critics noted that &quot;Halo 2&quot; stuck with the formula that made its predecessor successful, and was alternatively praised and faulted for this decision. &quot;Edge&quot;&#x27;s review concluded that &quot;Halo 2&quot; could be summed up with a line from its script: &quot;It&#x27;s not a new plan. But we know it&#x27;ll work.&quot;
The game&#x27;s campaign mode received some criticism for being too short, and for featuring an abrupt cliffhanger ending. GameSpot noted that although the story&#x27;s switching between the Covenant and human factions made the plot more intricate, it distracted the player from Earth&#x27;s survival and the main point of the game; while &quot;Edge&quot; labeled the plot &quot;a confusing mess of fan-fiction sci-fi and bemusing &quot;Episode-II&quot;-style politics.&quot;

&quot;Halo 2&quot; won multiple awards at the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, including &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Console First-Person Action Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Online Gameplay&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design&quot;, as well as nominations for &quot;Outstanding Innovation in Console Gaming&quot;, and &quot;Game of the Year&quot;. The game received more than 38 individual awards. It received runner-up placements in GameSpot&#x27;s 2004 &quot;Best Shooter&quot;, &quot;Best Sound Effects&quot; and &quot;Best Original Music&quot; categories across all platforms. The game was listed in Electronic Gaming Monthly&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest 200 Video Games of Their Time&quot; in 2006.

==Post-release==
===Updates and DLC===

&quot;Halo 2&quot;″s multiplayer suffered from widespread cheating on release. Some players used &quot;standbying&quot; or &quot;lag killing&quot; to cheat, where the player hosting the game intentionally pressed the standby button on his or her modem. This resulted in all other players freezing in place and allowed the cheater to kill other players or capture objectives. Another exploit called &quot;BXR&quot; allowed players to cancel melee animations and quickly attack for an instant kill. Rather than rely solely on user reports of misbehavior, Bungie leveraged its game statistics collection to proactively find cheating players, creating an automated banning system.

Bungie released several map packs for &quot;Halo 2&quot;, adding new environments for multiplayer matches. The Multiplayer Map Pack, released July 5, 2005, made Xbox Live content and updates available to offline players. The disc contains the game&#x27;s software update, nine new multiplayer maps, a making-of documentary, and a bonus cinematic called &quot;Another Day on the Beach&quot;, among other features. The Blastacular Map Pack contained two additional maps and released April 2007. On July 7 Bungie made the Blastacular Map Pack free.

&quot;Halo 2&quot; was one of the Xbox games that was backwards-compatible on the Xbox 360. On the newer console, the game runs at high-definition 720p with scene-wide anti-aliasing. The online services of the &quot;Halo 2&quot; were discontinued alongside other original Xbox console games in 2010.

===Ports and rereleases===

In February 2006, Microsoft announced a PC port of &quot;Halo 2&quot;, exclusively for the Windows Vista operating system. Like the Xbox version, the release of &quot;Halo 2 Vista&quot; was repeatedly delayed. The May 22, 2007, release date was pushed to May 31 after the discovery of partial nudity in the game&#x27;s map editor—a photograph of Charlie Gough, one of the Lead Engineers, mooning Steve Ballmer during his visit to the studio, was presented as part of the &quot;.ass&quot; error message. Microsoft offered patches to remove the nude content and revised the box ratings. The game could be enabled to play on Windows XP through an unauthorized third-party patch. &quot;Halo 2 Vista&quot; was ported by a small team at Microsoft Game Studios (codenamed Hired Gun) who worked closely with Bungie. As one of the launch titles of Games for Windows – Live, the game offered Live features not available in the Xbox version, such as Guide support and Achievements. The Windows port also added two exclusive multiplayer maps and a map editor. 

In January 2013, a blog post on Halo Waypoint indicated that online services for &quot;Halo 2 for Windows Vista&quot; would shut down on February 15, 2013. This date was pushed back multiple times, and the servers finally ceased operations in 2015. 

A high-definition remaster of &quot;Halo 2&quot; titled &quot;Halo 2 Anniversary&quot; was released as part of &quot;&quot; on November 11, 2014, for the Xbox One, later being released on PC for Steam and Windows Store.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Halo 2&quot;″s release was part of a shift towards blockbuster gaming releases. In 2004, the video game industry was estimated to gross $7.76 billion in the United States, behind the $9.4 billion gross of the domestic box office. &quot;Halo 2&quot;″s success was seen by the press as evidence of a generational shift in entertainment. The CBC&#x27;s Greg Bolton remarked that prior to &quot;Halo 2&quot;″s splashy release, &quot;the video-game industry hadn’t yet found a recognizable public face, a universally acclaimed megastar.&quot; &quot;The Ringer&quot; called &quot;Halo 2&quot; &quot;the birth of the video game as we know it today: a mass shared experience,&quot; and credited it with birthing modern multiplayer infrastructure and popularizing American esports.

&quot;Halo 2&quot;″s matchmaking technology was one of the turning points in the gaming industry during the 2000s, setting a new standard for other games. G4&#x27;s Sterling McGarvey wrote that &quot;Bungie&#x27;s sequel was a shot in the arm for Xbox Live subscriptions and previewed many of the features that would set the standard for Microsoft&#x27;s online service on the next machine&quot;. Critics credited the game with bringing online multiplayer to the console masses, and as serving as Xbox Live&#x27;s killer app. &quot;The Province&quot;″s Paul Chapman wrote that games like &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot; would not be enjoyable if not for the ground &quot;Halo 2&quot; broke.

<text>Omics is the collective characterization and quantification of entire sets of biological molecules and the investigation of how they translate into the structure, function, and dynamics of an organism or group of organisms. The branches of science known informally as &quot;omics&quot; are various disciplines in biology whose names end in the suffix &quot;&quot;, such as genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, phenomics and transcriptomics. 

The related suffix -ome is used to address the objects of study of such fields, such as the genome, proteome or metabolome respectively. The suffix &quot;-ome&quot; as used in molecular biology refers to a &quot;totality&quot; of some sort; it is an example of a &quot;neo-suffix&quot; formed by abstraction from various Greek terms in , a sequence that does not form an identifiable suffix in Greek.

Functional genomics aims at identifying the functions of as many genes as possible of a given organism. It combines
different -omics techniques such as transcriptomics and proteomics with saturated mutant collections.

==Origin==

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (&quot;OED&quot;) distinguishes three different fields of application for the &quot;-ome&quot; suffix:
#in medicine, forming nouns with the sense &quot;swelling, tumour&quot;
#in botany or zoology, forming nouns in the sense &quot;a part of an animal or plant with a specified structure&quot;
#in cellular and molecular biology, forming nouns with the sense &quot;all constituents considered collectively&quot;

The &quot;-ome&quot; suffix originated as a variant of &quot;-oma&quot;, and became productive in the last quarter of the 19th century. It originally appeared in terms like &quot;sclerome&quot; or &quot;rhizome&quot;. All of these terms derive from Greek words in , a sequence that is not a single suffix, but analyzable as , the belonging to the word stem (usually a verb) and the being a genuine Greek suffix forming abstract nouns.

The OED suggests that its third definition originated as a back-formation from &quot;mitome&quot;, Early attestations include &quot;biome&quot; (1916) and &quot;genome&quot; (first coined as German &quot;Genom&quot; in 1920).

The association with &quot;chromosome&quot; in molecular biology is by false etymology. The word &quot;chromosome&quot; derives from the Greek stems &quot;colour&quot; and &quot;body&quot;. While &quot;body&quot; genuinely contains the suffix, the preceding is not a stem-forming suffix but part of the word&#x27;s root. Because &quot;genome&quot; refers to the &quot;complete&quot; genetic makeup of an organism, a neo-suffix &quot;-ome&quot; suggested itself as referring to &quot;wholeness&quot; or &quot;completion&quot;.

Bioinformaticians and molecular biologists figured amongst the first scientists to apply the &quot;-ome&quot; suffix widely. Early advocates included bioinformaticians in Cambridge, UK, where there were many early bioinformatics labs such as the MRC centre, Sanger centre, and EBI (European Bioinformatics Institute); for example, the MRC centre carried out the first genome and proteome projects.

== Current usage ==
Many &quot;omes&quot; beyond the original &quot;genome&quot; have become useful and have been widely adopted by research scientists. &quot;Proteomics&quot; has become well-established as a term for studying proteins at a large scale. &quot;Omes&quot; can provide an easy shorthand to encapsulate a field; for example, an interactomics study is clearly recognisable as relating to large-scale analyses of gene-gene, protein-protein, or protein-ligand interactions. Researchers are rapidly taking up omes and omics, as shown by the explosion of the use of these terms in PubMed since the mid-1990s.

==Kinds of omics studies==

=== Genomics ===
* Genomics: Study of the genomes of organisms.
**Cognitive genomics: Study of the changes in cognitive processes associated with genetic profiles.
**Comparative genomics: Study of the relationship of genome structure and function across different biological species or strains.
**Functional genomics: Describes gene and protein functions and interactions (often uses transcriptomics).
**Metagenomics: Study of metagenomes, i.e., genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples.
**Neurogenomics: Study of genetic influences on the development and function of the nervous system.
**Pangenomics: Study of the entire collection of genes or genomes found within a given species.
**Personal genomics: Branch of genomics concerned with the sequencing and analysis of the genome of an individual. Once the genotypes are known, the individual&#x27;s genotype can be compared with the published literature to determine likelihood of trait expression and disease risk. Helps in Personalized Medicine
**Electromics: Branch of genomics concerned with the role of exogenous electric fields in potentiating the gene expression profiles of cells, tissues, and organoids.

=== Epigenomics ===
The epigenome is the supporting structure of the genome, including protein and RNA binders, alternative DNA structures, and chemical modifications on DNA.

* Epigenomics: Modern technologies include chromosome conformation by Hi-C, various ChIP-seq and other sequencing methods combined with proteomic fractionations, and sequencing methods that find chemical modification of cytosines, like bisulfite sequencing. 
* Nucleomics: Study of the complete set of genomic components which form &quot;the cell nucleus as a complex, dynamic biological system, referred to as the nucleome&quot;. The 4D Nucleome Consortium officially joined the IHEC (International Human Epigenome Consortium) in 2017.

=== Microbiomics ===
The &quot;microbiome&quot; is a microbial community occupying a well-defined habitat with distinct physio-chemical properties. It includes the microorganisms involved and their theatre of activity, forming ecological niches. Microbiomes form dynamic and interactive micro-ecosystems prone to spaciotemporal change. They are integrated into macro-ecosystems, such as eukaryotic hosts, and are crucial to the host&#x27;s proper function and health. The interactive host-microbe systems make up the holobiont.

Microbiomics is the study of microbiome dynamics, function, and structure. This area of study employs several techniques to study the microbiome in its host environment:
* Sampling methods focused on collecting representative samples of the local environment, either from oral swabs or stool.
* Culturomics (microbiology) is the high-throughput cell culture of bacteria that aims to comprehensively identify strains or species in samples obtained from tissues such as the human gut or from the environment.
* Microfluidics gut-on-a-chip devices, which simulate the conditions of the gut and allow analysis of changes to the microbiome that can be more accurately monitored than &quot;in situ&quot;.
* Mechanical DNA extraction techniques and gene amplification methods, such as PCR, to analyze the genomic profile of the entire microbiome.
* DNA fingerprinting using microarrays and hybridization techniques allow analysis of shifts in microbiota populations.
* Multi-omics studies allow for functional analysis of microbiota.
* Animal models can be used to take more accurate samples of the &quot;in situ&quot; microbiome. Germ-free animals are used to implant a specific microbiome from another organism to yield a gnotobiotic model. These can be studied to see how it changes under different environmental conditions.

=== Lipidomics ===
The lipidome is the entire complement of cellular lipids, including the modifications made to a particular set of lipids, produced by an organism or system.
*Lipidomics: Large-scale study of pathways and networks of lipids. Mass spectrometry techniques are used.

=== Proteomics ===
The proteome is the entire complement of proteins, including the modifications made to a particular set of proteins, produced by an organism or system. 
*Proteomics: Large-scale study of proteins, particularly their structures and functions. Mass spectrometry techniques are used.
**Chemoproteomics: An array of techniques used to study protein-small molecule interactions
**Immunoproteomics: Study of large sets of proteins (proteomics) involved in the immune response
**Nutriproteomics: Identifying the molecular targets of nutritive and non-nutritive components of the diet. Uses proteomics mass spectrometry data for protein expression studies
**Proteogenomics: An emerging field of biological research at the intersection of proteomics and genomics. Proteomics data used for gene annotations.
**Structural genomics: Study of the three-dimensional structure of every protein encoded by a given genome using a combination of experimental and modeling approaches.

=== Glycomics ===
Glycomics is the comprehensive study of the glycome i.e. sugars and carbohydrates.

=== Foodomics ===
Foodomics was defined by Alejandro Cifuentes in 2009 as &quot;a discipline that studies the food and nutrition domains through the application and integration of advanced omics technologies to improve consumer’s well-being, health, and knowledge.&quot;

=== Transcriptomics ===
Transcriptome is the set of all RNA molecules, including mRNA, rRNA, tRNA, and other non-coding RNA, produced in one or a population of cells.
*Transcriptomics: Study of transcriptomes, their structures and functions.

=== Metabolomics ===
The metabolome is the ensemble of small molecules found within a biological matrix.

*Metabolomics: Scientific study of chemical processes involving metabolites. It is a &quot;systematic study of the unique chemical fingerprints that specific cellular processes leave behind&quot;, the study of their small-molecule metabolite profiles
*Metabonomics: The quantitative measurement of the dynamic multiparametric metabolic response of living systems to pathophysiological stimuli or genetic modification

=== Nutrition, pharmacology, and toxicology ===
*Nutritional genomics: A science studying the relationship between human genome, nutrition and health.
**Nutrigenetics studies the effect of genetic variations on the interaction between diet and health with implications to susceptible subgroups
**Nutrigenomics: Study of the effects of foods and food constituents on gene expression. Studies the effect of nutrients on the genome, proteome, and metabolome
*Pharmacogenomics investigates the effect of the sum of variations within the human genome on drugs;
*Pharmacomicrobiomics investigates the effect of variations within the human microbiome on drugs and vice versa.
*Toxicogenomics: a field of science that deals with the collection, interpretation, and storage of information about gene and protein activity within particular cell or tissue of an organism in response to toxic substances.

=== Culture ===
Inspired by foundational questions in evolutionary biology, a Harvard team around Jean-Baptiste Michel and Erez Lieberman Aiden created the American neologism culturomics for the application of big data collection and analysis to cultural studies.

=== Miscellaneous ===

*Mitointeractome
*Psychogenomics: Process of applying the powerful tools of genomics and proteomics to achieve a better understanding of the biological substrates of normal behavior and of diseases of the brain that manifest themselves as behavioral abnormalities. Applying psychogenomics to the study of drug addiction, the ultimate goal is to develop more effective treatments for these disorders as well as objective diagnostic tools, preventive measures, and eventually cures.
*Stem cell genomics: Helps in stem cell biology. Aim is to establish stem cells as a leading model system for understanding human biology and disease states and ultimately to accelerate progress toward clinical translation.
*Connectomics: The study of the connectome, the totality of the neural connections in the brain.
*Microbiomics: The study of the genomes of the communities of microorganisms that live in a specific environmental niche.
*Cellomics: The quantitative cell analysis and study using bioimaging methods and bioinformatics.
*Tomomics: A combination of tomography and omics methods to understand tissue or cell biochemistry at high spatial resolution, typically using imaging mass spectrometry data.
*Viral metagenomics: Using omics methods in soil, ocean water, and humans to study the Virome and Human virome.
*Ethomics: The high-throughput machine measurement of animal behaviour.
*Videomics (or vide-omics): A video analysis paradigm inspired by genomics principles, where a continuous image sequence (or video) can be interpreted as the capture of a single image evolving through time through mutations revealing &#x27;a scene&#x27;.
*Multiomics: Integration of different omics in a single study or analysis pipeline.

==Unrelated words in &quot;-omics&quot;==
The word &quot;comic&quot; does not use the &quot;omics&quot; suffix; it derives from Greek &quot;κωμ(ο)-&quot; (&quot;merriment&quot;) + &quot;-ικ(ο)-&quot; (an adjectival suffix), rather than presenting a truncation of &quot;σωμ(ατ)-&quot;.

Similarly, the word &quot;economy&quot; is assembled from Greek &quot;οικ(ο)-&quot; (&quot;household&quot;) + &quot;νομ(ο)-&quot; (&quot;law&quot; or &quot;custom&quot;), and &quot;economic(s)&quot; from &quot;οικ(ο)-&quot; + &quot;νομ(ο)-&quot; + &quot;-ικ(ο)-&quot;. The suffix -omics is sometimes used to create names for schools of economics, such as Reaganomics.

<text>Meskheti () or Samtskhe (), also known as [[Moschia]] in ancient sources, is a mountainous area in southwestern Georgia.

==History==
Ancient tribes known as the Mushki (or Moschi) and Mosiniks (or Mossynoeci) were the first known inhabitants of the area of the modern Samtskhe-Javakheti region. Some scholars credit the Mosiniks with the invention of iron metallurgy.

Between the 2nd millennium BCE and the 4th century BCE, Meskheti was part of the kingdom of Diauehi. It was subsequently, until the 6th century, part of the Kingdom of Iberia.

During the 10th-15th centuries, this region was a part of the united Georgian Kingdom. In the 16th century it was the independent Principality of Samtskhe until it was occupied and annexed by the Ottoman Empire.

In 1829-1917 the region was a part of Tiflis Governorate, and then briefly (1918–1921) part of the Democratic Republic of Georgia. Between 1921-1990 it was a part of the Soviet Union, as the Georgian SSR.

Meskheti is now part of the Samtskhe-Javakheti region, together with Javakheti and Tori.

==Demographics==

===Ethnic groups===

==== Georgians ====
Meskhetians or Meskhs (Meskhi) are a subgroup of Georgians, the indigenous population of Meskheti. Meskhetians speak the Meskhetian dialect and are mainly Georgian Orthodox Christians in religion, while part of them are Catholics.

==== Meskhetian Turks ====
Meskhetian Turks are the former inhabitants of the Meskheti region of Georgia along the border with Turkey. They were deported to Central Asia during November 15–25, 1944 by Joseph Stalin and settled within Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. Of the 120,000 forcibly deported in cattle-trucks a total of 10,000 perished. Today they are dispersed over a number of other countries of the former Soviet Union. There are 500,000 to 700,000 Meskhetian Turks in exile in Azerbaijan and Central Asia. Most Meskhetian Turks are Sunni Hanafi Muslims.

<doc id="477513" wikidata="Q985009" url="?curid=477513" title="Helmholtz's theorems">
<text>In fluid mechanics, Helmholtz&#x27;s theorems, named after Hermann von Helmholtz, describe the three-dimensional motion of fluid in the vicinity of vortex lines. These theorems apply to inviscid flows and flows where the influence of viscous forces are small and can be ignored.

Helmholtz&#x27;s three theorems are as follows:
;Helmholtz&#x27;s first theorem:
:The strength of a vortex line is constant along its length.
;Helmholtz&#x27;s second theorem:
:A vortex line cannot end in a fluid; it must extend to the boundaries of the fluid or form a closed path.
;Helmholtz&#x27;s third theorem:
:A fluid element that is initially irrotational remains irrotational.

Helmholtz&#x27;s theorems apply to inviscid flows. In observations of vortices in real fluids the strength of the vortices always decays gradually due to the dissipative effect of viscous forces.

Alternative expressions of the three theorems are as follows:
# The strength of a vortex tube does not vary with time.
# Fluid elements lying on a vortex line at some instant continue to lie on that vortex line. More simply, vortex lines move with the fluid. Also vortex lines and tubes must appear as a closed loop, extend to infinity or start/end at solid boundaries.
# Fluid elements initially free of vorticity remain free of vorticity.

Helmholtz&#x27;s theorems have application in understanding:
*Generation of lift on an airfoil
*Starting vortex
*Horseshoe vortex
*Wingtip vortices.

Helmholtz&#x27;s theorems are now generally proven with reference to Kelvin&#x27;s circulation theorem. However Helmholtz&#x27;s theorems were published in 1858, nine years before the 1867 publication of Kelvin&#x27;s theorem.

<text>The needle-clawed bushbabies are the two species in the genus Euoticus, which is in the family Galagidae. Galagidae is sometimes included as a subfamily within the Lorisidae (or Loridae).

Unique to the needle-clawed bushbaby are the keeled nails, featuring prominent central ridges ending in needle-like points, present on all digits except the thumbs, the big toes, and the second foot phalanges which have claws.

The first specimen of &quot;E. elegantulus&quot; to arrive in Europe from Africa was brought by Gerald Durrell. The uncovering of this bush baby is documented in his 1957 book &quot;A Zoo in My Luggage&quot;.

The needle-clawed bushbabies have a diet that consists of insects, fruits and gums. Gum tends to be the largest contribute to their diet since 75% of their diet is base around gum.

<doc id="477519" wikidata="Q2032089" url="?curid=477519" title="Sloane Square">
<text>Sloane Square is a small hard-landscaped square on the boundaries of the central London districts of Belgravia and Chelsea, located southwest of Charing Cross, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The area forms a boundary between the two largest aristocratic estates in London, the Grosvenor Estate and the Cadogan. The square was formerly known as &#x27;Hans Town&#x27;, laid out in 1771 to a plan of by Henry Holland Snr. and Henry Holland Jnr. Both the square and Hans Town were named after Sir Hans Sloane (1660–1753), an Anglo-Irish doctor who, jointly with his appointed trustees, owned the land at the time.

==Location==
The bulk of Chelsea, especially the east end more local to Sloane Square, is architecturally and economically similar to South Kensington, Belgravia, St James&#x27;s, and Mayfair. The largely retail at ground floor Kings Road with its design and interior furnishing focus intersects at Sloane Square the residential, neatly corniced and dressed façades of Sloane Street leading from the Victoria Embankment promenade to the small district of Knightsbridge. On the northern side of the square is the Sloane Square Hotel.

;Exclusive housing hub
Estates on all sides are made up of ornate, luxuriously furnished private apartments set behind railings — a minority of these remain combined to form large townhouses, primarily in amongst those of rows of not more than four storeys. Gothic, classical and Edwardian architecture mix; the area has grown piecemeal, including in infill, under strict character and aesthetic demands of local urban planning. Elements of almost every street were reinstated, in similar style, after the London Blitz.

;Social analysis
In sociology, a small social class of London has since the 1980s been cast and to some extent outcast as Sloane Rangers or Sloanies, relatively young, underemployed and ostentatiously well-off members of the upper classes who linguistically have their own evolving lexicon, sloane(y) speak, spoken in received pronunciation. Some are heavily engaged investors in charities, new businesses and the arts, particularly with the influx of and integration with young, wealthy, foreign-born Chelsea residents. The endurance of this class is reflected in an occasional dramatic work or fly on the wall documentary such as &quot;Made in Chelsea&quot;.

==History==
The square has two notable buildings. Peter Jones department store designed by Reginald Uren of the firm Slater Moberly and Uren in 1936 and now a Grade II* listed building on account of its early curtain wall and modernist aesthetic, pioneering in the UK for a department store. The building was carefully restored 2003–2007 with internal upgrading in line with the original designs by John McAslan and Partners. This included making the three storey atrium full-height. Peter Jones now operates as part of the employee-owned John Lewis chain.

The other is the Royal Court Theatre first opened in 1888 which was important for avant-garde theatre in the 1960s and 1970s when the home of the English Stage Company.

100m from the Square in Sloane Terrace, the former Christian Science Church was built in 1907 and converted in 2002 for concert hall use as Cadogan Hall. It is now one of London&#x27;s leading classical music venues.

In 2005 revised landscaping of the square was proposed, involving a change to the road layout to make it more pedestrian friendly. One option was to create a central crossroads and two open spaces in front of Peter Jones and the Royal Court. The pedestrian area leading to Pavilion Road now houses the flagship stores of many luxury brands including Brora and Links of London. This option was put out to consultation, and the results in April 2007 showed that over 65% of respondents preferred a renovation of the existing square, so the crossroads plan has been shelved. Since then, independent proposals have been put forward for the square.

A short walk down Kings Road from the Square is the National Army Museum.

Holy Trinity Sloane Street, the Church of England parish church of 1890 (50m north of the Square) is sometimes known as the &quot;Cathedral of the Arts &amp; Crafts Movement on account of its fine fittings. These include a complete set of windows by Sir Edward Burne-Jones, the most extensive he ever created.

Sloane Square Underground station (District and Circle lines) is at the south eastern corner of the square and the lines cross under the square to the north west. The River Westbourne is carried over the tube station platforms in plain view, in a circular iron aqueduct.

==Fountain==

The &quot;Venus Fountain&quot; in the centre of the square was constructed in 1953, designed by sculptor Gilbert Ledward. The fountain depicts Venus, and on the basin section of the fountain is a relief which depicts King Charles II and Nell Gwynn by the Thames, which was used in relation to a house located close by that Nell Gwynn had used.

In 2006, David Lammy put forward a proposal to have the fountain grade II listed, which was successful.

==War memorial==
Also in the square, positioned slightly off-centre, is a stone cross that is known as Chelsea War Memorial. Made of Portland stone, and designed by an unknown architect, the cross has a capped head on a tapered shaft above a moulded three stage octagonal base. A large bronze sword is affixed to its west face. The cross is surmounted on a plinth which is inscribed with the following: The monument has also been Grade II listed, since 2005.

<text>The Yellowstone River is a tributary of the Missouri River, approximately long, in the Western United States. Considered the principal tributary of upper Missouri, via its own tributaries it drains an area with headwaters across the mountains and high plains of southern Montana and northern Wyoming, and stretching east from the Rocky Mountains in the vicinity of Yellowstone National Park. It flows northeast to its confluence with the Missouri River on the North Dakota side of the border, about west of Williston.

== Etymology ==

The name is widely believed to have been derived from the Minnetaree Indian name &quot;Mi tse a-da-zi&quot; (Yellow Rock River) (Hidatsa: &quot;miʔciiʔriaashiish&quot;&#x27;). Common lore recounts that the name was inspired by the yellow-colored rocks along the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, but the Minnetaree never lived along the upper stretches of the Yellowstone. Some scholars think that the river was instead named after yellow-colored sandstone bluffs on the lower Yellowstone.

The Cheyenne, who lived in the areas of present-day Billings and Yellowstone County, called it &quot;Mo&#x27;éheo&#x27;hé&#x27;e&quot; (also Yellow Rocks River). The Crow, who lived along the upper Yellowstone in southern Montana, called it &quot;E-chee-dik-karsh-ah-shay&quot; (Elk River). Translating the Minnetaree name, French trappers in the area referred to the river as &quot;Roche Jaune&quot; (Yellow Rock), a name adopted by ethnic American, French and other European mountain men until the mid-19th century.

Independently, Lewis and Clark recorded the English translation of Yellow Stone for the river after they encountered the Minnetaree in 1805. With expanding settlement by English-speaking people from the United States, the English name eventually became the most widely used. The river was explored in 1806 by William Clark as the Lewis and Clark Expedition returned east from the Pacific Coast. Clark&#x27;s Fork of the river was named after him.

Most of the natural features of the Yellowstone Valley not already named by Lewis and Clark were named by pioneer steamboat captain Grant Marsh. Marsh was selected by the Army for an exploratory expedition in 1873 on his riverboat &quot;Key West.&quot; The team was commanded by Brevet Brig. Gen. George Alexander Forsyth. Marsh kept a detailed log during the journey. The names he bestowed were recorded by an expedition representative of the War Department and applied to official maps; they include the following:

* Forsyth Butte, named in honor of Forsyth, commander of the expedition.
* Cut Nose Butte, Chimney Rock, and Diamond Island, for their resemblance to these objects.
* Seven Sisters Islands, in remembrance of Captain Marsh&#x27;s seven sisters.
* Crittenden Island, for General T. L. Crittenden, who commanded the 17th Infantry, which was garrisoned at posts along the Missouri River.
* Mary Island, for the chambermaid on the &quot;Key West,&quot; wife of the steward, &quot;Dutch Jake.&quot;
* Reno Island, for Major Marcus A. Reno, of the 7th Cavalry.
* Schindel Island, for Major M. Bryant, commanding the escort for the &quot;Key West.&quot;
* Edgerly Island, for Lieutenant W. S. Edgerly of the 7th Cavalry.
* Monroe Island, for Captain Marsh&#x27;s brother, Monroe Marsh.
* DeRussy Rapids, for Isaac D. DeRussy, later lieutenant-colonel of the 14th Infantry.
* McCune Rapids (later misspelled &quot;McKeon&quot; on maps), for one of Marsh&#x27;s longtime friends in St. Louis.
* Barr&#x27;s Bluff, for another Marsh friend.
* Stanley&#x27;s Point, for the colonel of the 22nd Infantry.
* Sheridan&#x27;s Buttes, for Lt. Gen. Philip Sheridan.

==Watershed==

The Yellowstone River watershed is a river basin spanning across Montana, with minor extensions into Wyoming and North Dakota, toward headwaters and terminus, respectively. The Yellowstone Basin watershed contains a system of rivers, including the Yellowstone River, and four tributary basins: the Clarks Fork Yellowstone, Wind River and Bighorn River, Tongue River, and Powder River. These rivers form tributaries to the Missouri River.

The mainstem of the Yellowstone River is more than long. At the headwaters, elevations exceed above sea level and descends to at the confluence with the Missouri River in far western North Dakota. The watershed spans . The area contains many lakes, including Yellowstone Lake. There are no storage dams located on the mainstem of the Yellowstone River. However, the watershed contains five major reservoirs built on tributary rivers: Bull Lake, Boysen, Buffalo Bill, Big Horn, Tongue River, and Lake De Smet reservoirs.

==Geography==
The river rises in northwestern Wyoming in the Absaroka Range, on the Continental Divide in southwestern Park County. The river starts where the North Fork and the South Fork of the Yellowstone River converge. The North Fork, the larger of the two forks, flows from Younts Peak. The South Fork flows from the southern slopes of Thorofare Mountain. The Yellowstone River flows northward through Yellowstone National Park, feeding and draining Yellowstone Lake, then dropping over the Upper and Lower Yellowstone Falls at the head of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone within the confines of the park. After passing through the Black Canyon of the Yellowstone downstream of the Grand Canyon, the river flows northward into Montana between the northern Absaroka Range and the Gallatin Range in Paradise Valley. The river emerges from the mountains near the town of Livingston, where it turns eastward and northeastward, flowing across the northern Great Plains past the city of Billings.

East of Billings, it is joined by the Bighorn River. Farther downriver, it is joined by the Tongue near Miles City, and then by the Powder in eastern Montana. It flows into the Missouri River near Buford, North Dakota just upstream from Lake Sakakawea. The latter is a reservoir formed in 1953 by the Garrison Dam, built on the Missouri River within the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. It flooded the fertile bottomlands of the Affiliated Tribes (Mandan, Arikara, Hidatsa), damaging their economy and reducing their ability to be self-sufficient.

In Montana, the river&#x27;s waters have been used extensively for irrigation since the 1860s. In its upper reaches, within Yellowstone Park and the mountains of Montana, it is a popular destination for fly fishing. The Yellowstone is a Class I river from the Yellowstone National Park boundary to the North Dakota border for the purposes of stream access for recreational purposes.

==Water right claims==
The division of water rights to the entire Yellowstone River Basin among Wyoming, Montana and North Dakota, governed by a 1950 compact, was disputed in a 2010 lawsuit brought directly to the U.S. Supreme Court by Montana against Wyoming. Oral argument took place in January 2011. On May 2, 2011, the Court held 7–2 (by Justice Thomas, with Justice Scalia dissenting) that Montana had no valid claim that its water supply had been diminished since Wyoming was irrigating the same acreage as always, albeit by a more modern method that returned less runoff to go downstream to Montana. (A subsequent 2011 Supreme Court case, in which Montana asserted ownership of Missouri Basin river bottoms, so as to collect decades of back rent from a hydropower company, is unrelated. On February 22, 2012, Montana lost that case too.)

==History==

The Yellowstone River had long been an important artery of transportation for Native Americans. The region around the Big Horn, Powder and Tongue rivers is the traditional summer hunting grounds for numerous Native American tribes: Lakota Sioux, Crow, Cheyenne and Cree. Gold was discovered near Virginia City, Montana in the 1860s, and two of the primary routes for accessing the goldfields were the Bozeman Trail and the Bridger Trail both of which followed the Yellowstone for a short length. In the 19th century, European-American settlers depended on the river for transportation, and generally entered the region by riverboat.

Native American anger at settler encroachment on their hunting grounds led to Red Cloud&#x27;s War. The conflict was settled with the Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1868, by which the US granted the territory of the Black Hills and the Powder River Country to the Lakota people. This region included the drainages of the Big Horn, Powder and Tongue rivers. But the discovery of gold in 1874 in the Black Hills, however, attracted thousands of miners who invaded the sacred grounds and competed for resources. New armed conflicts broke out with the Lakota Sioux.

The new competition and violence led to the Great Sioux War of 1876–77. The US sent in troops to protect the miners, although they had violated the treaty, and to defeat the Sioux. In 1876, Colonel John Gibbon led a column of men from Fort Ellis near Bozeman, Montana and traveled down the Yellowstone to meet up with General Alfred Terry&#x27;s Dakota Column, which had traveled upstream from North Dakota. Terry formed a base of operations at the mouth of Rosebud Creek on the Yellowstone, but the US miscalculated the strength of the Lakota, who had gathered by the thousands along the river. Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer departed from Rosebud Creek with the 7th Cavalry on the expedition that ended in his complete defeat by the Lakota and Cheyenne at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. The army ferried its survivors down the Yellowstone to the Missouri, and to Fort Abraham Lincoln.

The US Army returned in force and finally achieved victory over the tribes, forcing them onto reservations. The Lakota and allies were forced from eastern Montana and Wyoming: some bands fled to Canada, while others suffered removal to distant reservations, primarily located in present-day South Dakota and Nebraska west of the Missouri River. Crow warriors had enlisted as scouts with the US Army during the war and the Crow Indian Reservation was established in south-central Montana. The Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation is south of the Yellowstone in Montana.

Many of the early expeditions to the area that was later protected as Yellowstone National Park traveled along the Yellowstone River. These included the Cook–Folsom–Peterson Expedition and the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition. In the early 1870s, the Northern Pacific Railroad attempted to extend rail service along the Yellowstone to Livingston from Bismarck, North Dakota, a route proposed to cross the last of the Lakota buffalo hunting grounds. This route was finally completed in 1883. By the early 20th century, Northern Pacific was providing train service along the river to the north entrance of the park near Gardiner.

=== Incidents ===

====2011 oil spill====
An ExxonMobil pipeline runs from Silver Tip, to Billings, Montana. On Friday, July 1, 2011, it ruptured about west of Billings at about 10:40 p.m. The resulting spill leaked an estimated 1,500 barrels of oil, equivalent to , into the Yellowstone River for 56 minutes before it was shut down. As a precaution against a possible explosion, officials in Laurel, Montana evacuated about 140 people on Saturday just after midnight, allowing them to return at 4 a.m. Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer stated that &quot;The parties responsible will restore the Yellowstone River&quot;.

====2015 oil spill====
According to the Bridger Pipeline LLC, an oil spill occurred near Glendive on January 17, 2015, at 10 a.m. In response, the pipeline company shut down the pipeline at 11 a.m. in effort to prevent further environmental hazards. The company stated that 300–1,200 oil barrels (equivalent to 12,600 to 50,400 US gallons) were spilled into the river. State officials estimated, on the other hand, up to of spilled oil. Benzene, a carcinogen, was found in ten to fifteen parts per billion. An EPA official said that &quot;anything above five parts per billion is considered a long-term risk.&quot; Nearly 6,000 people were told not to use municipal water in Glendive due to the elevated levels of cancer-causing benzene found in the Yellowstone River, and in the tap water supplied. Bottled water was provided to their residents. On January 23, 2015, the city water treatment plant was declared decontaminated. City officials declared tap water safe to consume.

The Wyoming company from True Companies&#x27; Poplar pipeline system involved in this incident has a history of nine oil spills in 2006–14 leaking an amount of of crude. Also, their sister company Belle Fourche Pipeline owned by Tad True and their family, recorded twenty-one incidents in the same period leaking of oil, both companies had federal fines levied against them and appear in governments records. The oil cleanup on Yellowstone River was put on hold for one month or more on February 3, 2015 until the ice melts. Montana Department of Environmental Quality was monitoring an area spanning a stretch of the Yellowstone, from the spill site downstream to a bridge just across the North Dakota border.

====2016 river closure====
On August 19, 2016 the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks Department indefinitely closed the river and its tributaries from Gardiner, Montana to Laurel, Montana to all recreational activity. The closure resulted from a massive fish kill attributed to proliferative kidney disease, a rare but serious salmonid disease. The parasite--&quot;Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae&quot;—is not harmful to humans or other mammals. Wildlife officials estimate tens of thousands of fish may have died, mostly mountain whitefish, but Yellowstone cutthroat and rainbow trout have been affected.
The closure is expected to cause significant adverse economic impact to businesses which depend on summer tourist and recreational activities along the river.

On September 1, 2016, the agency reopened two stretches of the river. The first stretch, from the northern boundary of Yellowstone National Park to Carbella, Montana, was open to non-fishing recreation only to allow the fish population to recover. The second stretch, from Carbella, Montana to Laurel, Montana, was opened to all uses.

Peak Yellowstone River temperatures exceeded for 18 straight days from July 17 to August 4.
Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks notes that trout and whitefish prefer water temperatures close to .

====2021 river closure====
On January 26, 2021, the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks closed a section of the Yellowstone River approximately east of Reed Point at the request of the Montana Department of Transportation (MDT), after MDT inspectors discovered the bridge that carried Twin Bridges Road (former US-10) over the river was in danger of collapse. The 3-span truss bridge, built in 1931, had shown advanced deterioration of the structural members. Of particular concern, one of the bridge piers had lost about half of its support capacity due to bridge scour undermining the pier footings. MDT awarded a $2 million emergency demolition contract on March 11, 2021. By the end of April 2021, construction crews had safely dismantled the failing structure, and the river reopened on May 26, 2021.

==== 2022 river floods ====

On June 13, 2022, Yellowstone National Park officials announced all park entrances were closed to visitors, citing &quot;record flooding events&quot; and a forecast of more rain to come. The historic Carbella Bridge was destroyed.

==== 2023 bridge failure ====
In June 2023, a railroad bridge collapsed that had been built adjacent to the Twin Bridges Road Bridge (–2021). This resulted in several rail cars falling into the Yellowstone River. Approximately of molten petroleum products were released into the river. Fish consumption advisories were put in place due to the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in mountain whitefish downstream of the collapse.

==Climate patterns==
Flooding occurs in the watershed due to snowmelt, rainfall, and intense thunderstorms. In higher elevations, snowmelt can cause flood conditions due to rapid melt in spring and early summer. In lower elevations, regional rainstorms and intense thunderstorms can cause flooding in summer and fall.

Severe droughts have occurred in the Yellowstone Watershed that have lasted several years. Droughts have occurred in the basin in 1929–42, 1948–62 and 1976–82. The 1977 drought affected most of the western United States and resulted in decreased streamflows in the watershed. The reduced flow resulted in increased dissolved solids concentrations in the basin. Water quality varies across the various rivers in the basin. In mountainous areas, suspended sediment and dissolved solid concentrations are lower than in basin and plain areas. Human activities, including agriculture and mining, along with natural sources, contribute to suspended sedimentation levels in plain areas. In addition, fecal bacteria, salt, and selenium contamination is present in some streams within the watershed.

The exploitation of oil resources and infrastructure in the region has also produced contamination of the river, including by major oil spills.

==Fishing==
The Yellowstone River is considered to be one of the greatest trout streams of the world and is officially classed as a blue ribbon stream in Montana from the park to the confluence with the Boulder River east of Livingston and from the mouth of Rosebud creek near Rosebud, Montana to the North Dakota border. The lack of dams along the river provides for excellent trout habitat from high inside Yellowstone Park, downstream through Gardiner, the Paradise Valley, Livingston, and to Big Timber, a stretch of nearly . The Yellowstone varies in width from to , so fishing is normally done by boat. The most productive stretch of water is through Paradise Valley in Montana, especially near Livingston which holds brown, rainbow and native Yellowstone cutthroat trout as well as mountain whitefish. From Billings downstream to the North Dakota border, anglers seek burbot, channel catfish, paddlefish, sauger, smallmouth bass, and walleye. The pallid sturgeon (&quot;Scaphirhynchus albus&quot;), an endangered species endemic to the waters of the Missouri and lower Mississippi River basins, is also found in the Yellowstone.

<text>The greater galagos or thick-tailed bushbabies are three species of strepsirrhine primates. They are classified in the genus Otolemur in the family Galagidae.

==Historical classification and species discovery==
The diversity of galago species has historically been grossly underestimated. In 1931, only 5 species were recognized, 4 in the genus &quot;Galago&quot; and 1 in &quot;Euoticus&quot;, and only one species that would later be placed in the genus &quot;Otolemur&quot;. In 1979, the genus &quot;Otolemur&quot; was separated from &quot;Galago&quot;. By 1986, eleven species were recognized with revamped systemic classification including &quot;Otolemur crassicaudatus&quot; and &quot;Otolemur garnettii&quot;. Additionally, &quot;O. crassidautus&quot; and &quot;O. monteiri&quot; were recognized as separate species instead of &quot;O. monteiri&quot; as a nested subspecies. By 2001, 23 species were recognized. Classification by vocalization has particularly become prevalent and helpful as a tool in understanding of these species. All &quot;Otolemur&quot; species exhibit trailing advertising calls.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is found in and around coastal regions of Southern and Southeastern Africa; north from the Juba River in Somalia, southwards through Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, and Mozambique; west across Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Botswana; southwest to northern South Africa and as far west as Angola and Namibia. For the most part, they live in woodlands and forests, but also are found in sparsely wooded grasslands and even planted city parks and gardens.

<text>Forced displacement (also forced migration or forced relocation) is an involuntary or coerced movement of a person or people away from their home or home region. The UNHCR defines &#x27;forced displacement&#x27; as follows: displaced &quot;as a result of persecution, conflict, generalized violence or human rights violations&quot;.

A forcibly displaced person may also be referred to as a &quot;forced migrant&quot;, a &quot;displaced person&quot; (DP), or, if displaced within the home country, an &quot;internally displaced person&quot; (IDP). While some displaced persons may be considered refugees, the latter term specifically refers to such displaced persons who are receiving legally-defined protection and are recognized as such by their country of residence and/or international organizations.

Forced displacement has gained attention in international discussions and policy making since the European migrant crisis. This has since resulted in a greater consideration of the impacts of forced migration on affected regions outside Europe. Various international, regional, and local organizations are developing and implementing approaches to both prevent and mitigate the impact of forced migration in the home regions as well as the receiving or destination regions. Additionally, some collaboration efforts are made to gather evidence in order to seek prosecution of those involved in causing events of human-made forced migration. An estimated 100 million people around the world were forcibly displaced by the end of 2022, with the majority coming from the Global South.

== Definitions ==
Governments, NGOs, other international organizations and social scientists have defined forced displacement in a variety of ways. They have generally agreed that it is the forced removal or relocation of a person from their environment and associated connections. It can involve different types of movements, such as flight (from fleeing), evacuation, and population transfer.

* The International Organization for Migration defines a forced migrant as any person migrating to &quot;escape persecution, conflict, repression, natural and human-made disasters, ecological degradation, or other situations that endanger their lives, freedom or livelihood&quot;. 
* According to UNESCO, forced displacement is &quot;the forced movement of people from their locality or environment and occupational activities,&quot; with its leading cause being armed conflict.
* According to researcher Alden Speare, even movement under immediate threat to life contains a voluntary element as long as an option exists going into hiding, or attempting to avoid persecution. According to him &quot;migration can be considered to be involuntary only when a person is physically transported from a country and has no opportunity to escape from those transporting him [or her].&quot; This viewpoint has come under scrutiny when considering direct and indirect factors which may leave migrants with little to no choice in their decisions, such as imminent threats to life and livelihood.

=== Distinctions between the different concepts ===
* A migrant who fled their home because of economic hardship is an economic migrant, and strictly speaking, not a displaced person.
* If the displaced person was forced out of their home because of economically driven projects, such as the Three Gorges Dam in China, the situation is referred to as &quot;development-induced displacement&quot;.
* A displaced person who left their home region because of political persecution or violence, but did not cross an international border, commonly falls into the looser category of &quot;internally displaced person&quot; (IDP), subject to more tenuous international protection. In 1998, the UN Commission on Human Rights published the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, defining internally displaced people as: &quot;persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or leave their homes or places of habitual residence in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights, or natural or human-made disasters and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border.&quot;
* If the displaced person has crossed an international border and falls under one of the relevant international legal instruments, they may be able to apply for asylum and can become a refugee if the application is successful. Although often incorrectly used as a synonym for &quot;displaced person&quot;, the term &quot;refugee&quot; refers specifically to a legally-recognized status that has access to specific legal protections. Loose application of the term &quot;refugee&quot; may cause confusion between the general descriptive class of displaced persons and those who can legally be defined as refugees.
* Some forced migrants may, due to the country of residence&#x27;s legal system, be unable to apply for asylum in that country. Thus, even though they meet the international law definition of a refugee they are unable to claim asylum and become recognised by their host country as refugees.
* A displaced person crossing an international border without permission from the country they are entering or without subsequently applying for asylum may be considered an illegal immigrant.
* Forced migrants are always either IDPs or displaced people, as both of these terms do not require a legal framework and the fact that they left their homes is sufficient. The distinction between the terms &quot;displaced person&quot; and &quot;forced migrant&quot; is minor; however, the term &quot;displaced person&quot; has an important historic context (e.g. World War II).

==== History of the term &quot;displaced person&quot; ====

The term &quot;displaced person&quot; (DP) was first widely used during World War II, following the subsequent refugee outflows from Eastern Europe. In this context, &quot;DP&quot; specifically referred to an individual removed from their native country as a refugee, prisoner or a slave laborer. Most war victims, political refugees, and DPs of the immediate post-Second World War period were Ukrainians, Poles, other Slavs, and citizens of the Baltic states (Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians) who refused to return to Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe.
A. J. Jaffe claimed that the term was originally coined by Eugene M. Kulischer. The meaning has significantly broadened in the past half-century.

==Causes and examples==
Bogumil Terminski distinguishes two general categories of displacement:

* Displacement of risk: mostly conflict-induced displacement, deportations and disaster-induced displacement.
* Displacement of adaptation: associated with voluntary migration, development-induced displacement and environmentally-induced displacement.

=== Natural causes ===
Forced displacement may directly result from natural disasters and indirectly from the subsequent impact on infrastructure, food and water access, and local/regional economies. Displacement may be temporary or permanent, depending on the scope of the disaster and the area&#x27;s recovery capabilities. Climate change is increasing the frequency of major natural disasters, possibly placing a greater number of populations in situations of forced displacement. Also crop failures due to blight and/or pests fall within this category by affecting people&#x27;s access to food. Additionally, the term environmental refugee represents people who are forced to leave their traditional habitat because of environmental factors which negatively impact their livelihood, or even environmental disruption i.e. biological, physical or chemical change in ecosystem. Migration can also occur as a result of slow-onset climate change, such as desertification or sea-level rise, of deforestation or land degradation.

==== Examples of forced displacement caused by natural disasters ====
* 2024 LA Fires: LA Fires displacing approximately 200,000 people. 
* 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami: Resulting from a 9.1 earthquake off the coast of North Sumatra, the Indian Ocean Tsunami claimed over 227,898 lives, heavily damaging coastlines throughout the Indian Ocean. As a result, over 1.7 million people were displaced, mostly from Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and India.
*Hurricane Katrina (2005): Striking New Orleans, Louisiana, in late August 2005, Hurricane Katrina inflicted approximately US$125 billion in damages, standing as one of the costliest storms in United States history. As a result of the damage inflicted by Katrina, over one million people were internally displaced. One month after the disaster, over 600,000 remained displaced. Immediately following the disaster, New Orleans lost approximately half of its population, with many residents displaced to cities such as Houston, Dallas, Baton Rouge, and Atlanta. According to numerous studies, displacement disproportionally impacted Louisiana&#x27;s poorer populations, specifically African Americans.
*2011 East Africa drought: Failed rains in Somalia, Kenya, and Ethiopia led to high livestock and crop losses, driving majority pastoralist populations to surrounding areas in search of accessible food and water. In addition to seeking food and water, local populations&#x27; migration was motivated by an inability to maintain traditional lifestyles. According to researchers, although partly influenced by local armed conflict, the East African drought stands as an example of climate change impacts.

=== Human-made causes ===
Human-made displacement describes forced displacement caused by political entities, criminal organizations, conflicts, human-made environmental disasters, development, etc. Although impacts of natural disasters and blights/pests may be exacerbated by human mismanagement, human-made causes refer specifically to those initiated by humans. According to UNESCO, armed conflict stands as the most common cause behind forced displacement, reinforced by regional studies citing political and armed conflict as the largest attributing factors to migrant outflows from Latin America, Africa, and Asia.

==== Examples of forced displacement caused by criminal activity ====

* Displacement in Mexico due to cartel violence: Throughout Mexico, drug cartel, paramilitary, and self-defense group violence drives internal and external displacement. According to a comprehensive, mixed methodology study by Salazar and Álvarez Lobato, families fled their homes as a means of survival, hoping to escape homicide, extortion, and potential kidnapping. Using a collection of available data and existing studies, the total number of displaced persons between 2006 and 2012 was approximately 740 thousands.
*Displacement in Central America due to cartel/gang violence: A major factor behind US immigrant crises in the early 21st century (such as the 2014 immigrant crisis), rampant gang violence in the Northern Triangle, combined with corruption and low economic opportunities, has forced many to flee their country in pursuit of stability and greater opportunity. Homicide rates in countries such as El Salvador and Honduras reached some of the highest in the world, with El Salvador peaking at 103 homicides per 100,000 people. Contributing factors include extortion, territorial disputes, and forced gang recruitment, resulting in some estimates of approximately 500,000 people displaced annually.
*Displacement in Colombia due to conflict and drug-related violence: According to researchers Mojica and Eugenia, Medellín, Colombia around 2013 exemplified crime and violence-induced forced displacement, standing as one of the most popular destinations for IDPs while also producing IDPs of its own. Rural citizens fled from organized criminal violence, with the majority pointing to direct threats as the main driving force, settling in Medellín in pursuit of safety and greater opportunity. Within Medellín, various armed groups battled for territorial control, forcing perceived opponents from their homes and pressuring residents to abandon their livelihoods, among other methods. All in all, criminal violence forced Colombians to abandon their possessions, way of life, and social ties in pursuit of safety.

==== Examples of forced displacement caused by political conflict ====

* 1949–1956 Palestinian exodus
* 1950-1951 exodus of Turks from Bulgaria: according to some, caused because the Turkish support of the USA during the Korean War. Communist ideologies, Islamophobia and Anti-Turkism also played a role.
*Jewish exodus from the Muslim world
* Vietnam War: Throughout the Vietnam War and in the years preceding it, many populations were forced out of Vietnam and the surrounding countries as a result of armed conflict and/or persecution by their governments, such as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. This event is referred to as the Indochina refugee crisis, with millions displaced across Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America.
*Salvadoran Civil War: Throughout and after the 12-year conflict between the Salvadoran government and the FMLN, Salvadorans faced forced displacement as a result of combat, persecution, and deteriorating quality of life/access to socioeconomic opportunities. Overall, one in four Salvadorans were internally and externally displaced (over one million people).
* 2021 Myanmar coup d&#x27;état: Since the coup d’état of 1 February 2021, the Burmese military&#x27;s ascendancy into power has resulted in widespread chaos and violence, aggravated by the refusal of large sections of the public to accept a military regime given the country&#x27;s experiences during the second half of the 20th and early years of the 21st century. As a result, many in the public sector have initiated strikes, and the country has seen elevated levels of forced displacement, both internally displaced persons (IDPs) (208,000 since 1 February 2021) and refugees fleeing abroad (an estimated 22,000 since 1 February 2021). The particular political conflict causing the displacement has been flagged as symptomatic of that of a state on the brink of collapse. Two key indicators of this that have been highlighted are firstly, that levels of security have been severely reduced to the point where citizens are no longer protected from violence by the state; and secondly, goods and services are not being reliably supplied to citizens either by the ousted government or by the new military leadership, primarily as a result of the instability created and the strikes triggered. These internal problems are further reflected by the withdrawal of international recognition by both governmental and non-governmental bodies.

==== Examples of forced displacement caused by human-made environmental disasters ====

* 2019 Amazon rainforest wildfires: Although human-made fires are a normal part of Amazonian agriculture, the 2019 dry season saw an internationally noted increase in their rate of occurrence. The rapidly spreading fires, combined with efforts from agricultural and logging companies, has forced Brazil&#x27;s indigenous populations off their native lands.
*Chernobyl disaster: A nuclear meltdown on April 26, 1986, near Pripyat, Ukraine contaminated the city and surrounding areas with harmful levels of radiation, forcing the displacement of over 100,000 people.
* Great Famine of Ireland: Between 1845 and 1849, potato blight, exacerbated by policy decisions and mismanagement by the U.K. government, caused millions of Irish people, largely potato-dependent tenant farmers, to starve or eventually flee the country. Over one million perished from subsequent famine and disease, and another million fled the country, reducing the overall Irish population by at least a quarter.

==== Other human-made displacement ====
* Human trafficking/smuggling: Migrants displaced through deception or coercion with purpose of their exploitation fall under this category. Due to its clandestine nature, the data on such type of forced migration are limited. A disparity also exists between the data for male trafficking (such as for labor in agriculture, construction etc.) and female trafficking (such as for sex work or domestic service), with more data available for males. The International Labour Organization considers trafficking an offense against labor protection, denying companies from leveraging migrants as a labor resource. ILO&#x27;s Multilateral Framework includes principle no. 11, recommending that &quot;Governments should formulate and implement, in consultation with the social partners, measures to prevent abusive practices, migrant smuggling and people trafficking; they should also work towards preventing irregular labor migration.&quot;
*Slavery: Historically, slavery has led to the displacement of individuals for forced labor, with the Middle Passage of the 15th through 19th century Atlantic slave trade standing as a notable example. Of the 20 million Africans captured for the trade, half died in their forced march to the African coast, and another ten to twenty percent died on slave ships carrying them from Africa to the Americas.
*Ethnic cleansing: The systematic removal of ethnic or religious groups from a territory with the intent of making it ethnically homogeneous. Examples include the Catholic removal of Salzburg Protestants, the removal of Jewish people during the Holocaust, and the deportation of North American indigenous peoples (e.g., Trail of Tears).
* Suppressing political opposition: For example, the forced settlements in the Soviet Union and population transfer in the Soviet Union including deportation of the Crimean Tatars, deportation of the Chechens and Ingush, deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union, deportation of the Soviet Greeks, and deportations of the Ingrian Finns
* Aligning ethnic composition with artificial political border: For example flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–1950), Polish population transfers (1944–1946), and Operation Vistula
* Colonization: For example, the British governments transportation of Convicts in Australia, American Colonization Society and others&#x27; attempt to create a country for African Americans in Africa as Liberia, Japanese settlers in Manchukuo following Japanese invasion of Manchuria, and the Chinese military settlement of Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps in Xinjiang.

== Conditions faced by displaced persons ==

Displaced persons face adverse conditions when taking the decision to leave, traveling to a destination, and sometimes upon reaching their destination. Displaced persons are often forced to place their lives at risk, travel in inhumane conditions, and may be exposed to exploitation and abuse. These risk factors may increase through the involvement of smugglers and human traffickers, who may exploit them for illegal activities such as drug/weapons trafficking, forced labor, or sex work. The states where migrants seek protection may consider them a threat to national security. Displaced persons may also seek the assistance of human smugglers (such as coyotes in Latin America) throughout their journey. Given the illegal nature of smuggling, smugglers may take use dangerous methods to reach their destination without capture, exposing displaced persons to harm and sometimes resulting in deaths. Examples include abandonment, exposure to exploitation, dangerous transportation conditions, and death from exposure to harsh environments.

In most instances of forced migration across borders, migrants do not possess the required documentation for legal travel. The states where migrants seek protection may consider them a threat to national security. As a result, displaced persons may face detainment and criminal punishment, as well as physical and psychological trauma. Various studies focusing on migrant health have specifically linked migration to increased likelihood of depression, anxiety, and other psychological troubles. For example, the United States has faced criticism for its recent policies regarding migrant detention, specifically the detention of children. Critics point to poor detention conditions, unstable contact with parents, and high potential for long-term trauma as reasons for seeking policy changes. Displaced persons risk greater poverty than before displacement, financial vulnerability, and potential social disintegration, in addition to other risks related to human rights, culture, and quality of life. Forced displacement has varying impacts, dependent on the means through which one was forcibly displaced, their geographic location, their protected status, and their ability to personally recover. Under the most common form of displacement, armed conflict, individuals often lose possession of their assets upon fleeing and possible upon arrival to a new country, where they can also face cultural, social, and economic discontinuity.

== Responses to forced displacement ==

=== International response ===
Responses to situations of forced displacement vary across regional and international levels, with each type of forced displacement demonstrating unique characteristics and the need for a considerate approach. At the international level, international organizations (e.g. the UNHCR), NGOs (Doctors without Borders), and country governments (USAID) may work towards directly or indirectly ameliorating these situations. Means may include establishing internationally recognized protections, providing clinics to migrant camps, and supplying resources to populations. According to researchers such as Francis Deng, as well as international organizations such as the UN, an increase in IDPs compounds the difficulty of international responses, posing issues of incomplete information and questions regarding state sovereignty. State sovereignty especially becomes of concern when discussing protections for IDPs, who are within the borders of a sovereign state, placing reluctance in the international community&#x27;s ability to respond. Multiple landmark conventions aim at providing rights and protections to the different categories of forcibly displaced persons, including the 1951 Refugee Convention, the 1967 Protocol, the Kampala Convention, and the 1998 Guiding Principles. Despite internationally cooperation, these frameworks rely on the international system, which states may disregard. In a 2012 study, Young Hoon Song found that nations &quot;very selectively&quot; responded to instances of forced migration and internally displaced persons.

World organizations such as the United Nations and the World Bank, as well as individual countries, sometimes directly respond to the challenges faced by displaced people, providing humanitarian assistance or forcibly intervening in the country of conflict. Disputes related to these organizations&#x27; neutrality and limited resources has affected the capabilities of international humanitarian action to mitigate mass displacement mass displacement&#x27;s causes. These broad forms of assistance sometimes do not fully address the multidimensional needs of displaced persons. Regardless, calls for multilateral responses echo across organizations in the face of falling international cooperation. These organizations propose more comprehensive approaches, calling for improved conflict resolution and capacity-building in order to reduce instances of forced displacement.

=== Local response ===
Responses at multiple levels and across sectors is vital. A research has for instance highlighted the importance of collaboration between businesses and non-governmental organizations to tackle resettlement and employment issues.

Lived in experiences of displaced persons will vary according to the state and local policies of their country of relocation. Policies reflecting national exclusion of displaced persons may be undone by inclusive urban policies. Sanctuary cities are an example of spaces that regulate their cooperation or participation with immigration law enforcement. The practice of urban membership upon residence allows displaced persons to have access to city services and benefits, regardless of their legal status. Sanctuary cities have been able to provide migrants with greater mobility and participation in activities limiting the collection of personal information, issuing identification cards to all residents, and providing access to crucial services such as health care. Access to these services can ease the hardships of displaced people by allowing them to healthily adjust to life after displacement .

===Criminal prosecution===
Forced displacement has been the subject of several trials in local and international courts. For an offense to classify as a war crime, the civilian victim must be a &quot;protected person&quot; under international humanitarian law. Originally referring only categories of individuals explicitly protected under one of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, &quot;protected person&quot; now refers to any category of individuals entitled to protection under specific law of war treaties.

In Article 49, the Fourth Geneva Convention, adopted on 12 August 1949, specifically forbade forced displacementThe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court defines forced displacement as a crime within the jurisdiction of the court:

* Following the end of World War II, the Krupp trial was held with a specific charge to the forced displacement of enemy civilian populations for the purpose of forced labor. The US Military Tribunal concluded that &quot;[t]here is no international law that permits the deportation or the use of civilians against their will for other than on reasonable requisitions for the need of the army, either within the area of the army or after deportation to rear areas or to the homeland of the occupying power&quot;.
* At the Nuremberg trials, Hans Frank, chief jurist in occupied Poland, was found guilty, among others for forced displacement of the civilian population.
* Several people were tried and convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for connection to forced displacement during the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s. On 11 April 2018, the Appeals Chamber sentenced Vojislav Šešelj 10 years in prison under Counts 1, 10, and 11 of the indictment for instigating deportation, persecution (forcible displacement), and other inhumane acts (forcible transfer) as crimes against humanity due to his speech in Hrtkovci on 6 May 1992, in which he called for the expulsion of Croats from Vojvodina. Other convictions for forced displacement included ex-Bosnian Serb politician Momčilo Krajišnik, ex-Croatian Serb leader Milan Martić, former Bosnian Croat paramilitary commander Mladen Naletilić, and Bosnian Serb politician Radoslav Brđanin.
* On 17 March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and Russia&#x27;s Commissioner for Children&#x27;s Rights Maria Lvova-Belova for war crimes of deportation and illegal transfer of children from occupied Ukraine to Russia.

<text>Louis William Tordella (May 1, 1911 – January 9, 1996) was the longest serving deputy director of the National Security Agency.

==Biography==
Tordella was born in Garrett, Indiana, on May 1, 1911 and grew up in the Chicago environs. He displayed an early affinity for mathematics, and obtained bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees in the 1930s. The outbreak of World War II found him teaching mathematics at Chicago&#x27;s Loyola University. He joined the US Navy, immediately made contacts in the service, and was brought aboard as a lieutenant junior grade in 1942. He went directly into cryptologic work for the Navy&#x27;s codebreaking organization, OP-20-G. He finished the war at OP-20-G collection stations on the West Coast, at Bainbridge Island, Washington, and Skaggs Island Naval Communication Station.

After the war Tordella stayed on with the Navy, and in 1949 joined the newly created Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA), an early attempt to achieve service unity in the business of cryptology. He was a key figure in devising policy for the new agency, and for its successor, the National Security Agency, which emerged in 1952 to replace AFSA.

His career at NSA brought him to the very front rank of cryptologists. He was an early advocate of the use of computers for cryptologic work, and helped to cement a close working relationship with American industry. His grasp of computer technology and the associated engineering concepts, coupled with his understanding of cryptanalysis, led Tordella to push forcefully for the development of supercomputers for cryptologic applications. Tordella was also a leader in securing American communications, pushing a series of leading-edge new encoding devices to secure U.S. Government communications.

As a senior official at NSA, Tordella played a central role in NSA&#x27;s outside relationships. Close collaborators in Britain and the Commonwealth of Nations built up such a trust with Tordella that many foreign intelligence officials regarded him as the linchpin in their relationship with NSA.

Tordella became the deputy director of NSA in 1958, and remained in the post until his retirement in 1974. He thus became the longest serving deputy director in NSA&#x27;s history.

While serving as Deputy Director of the NSA, he commented on the 1967 USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident: “I believe it was a deliberate attack.” His thoughts were further reflected in a NSA report in which he referred to the cover-up as “A nice whitewash for a group of ignorant, stupid and inept XXX [expletive]. If the attackers had not been Hebrew there would have been quite a commotion. Such crass stupidity – 30 knots, warship, 2 guns, etc., does not even do credit to the Nigerian Navy.” After consideration was given to ordering a U.S. Navy submarine to sink the &quot;Liberty&quot; in order to avoid the political liability of her being photographed, Tordella vocally opposed the idea: “Consideration was being given by some unnamed Washington authorities to sink the &quot;Liberty&quot; in order that newspaper men would be unable to photograph her and thus inflame public opinion against the Israelis. I made an impolite comment about that idea.”

Tordella received unprecedented honors over the years. On his retirement in 1974 he received both the National Security Medal and the National Intelligence Distinguished Service Medal. His relationship with the British was recognized in 1976 when he became an Honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. In 1992 the Security Affairs Support Association, composed mainly of retired intelligence officials, gave him the William O. Baker medal for distinguished service to American intelligence.

He died at the Bethesda Naval Hospital in 1996. 
He had both Waldenström&#x27;s macroglobulinemia and colon cancer but no autopsy was done to determine what actually caused his death.

==Aftermath==
Following his death, sixteen boxes were recovered from his NSA office safe. According to Stephen Budiansky, &quot;...the documents turned out to be a compendium of every single one of NSA&#x27;s most highly classified, compartmented programs of the post-World War II era.&quot; Lew Allen, the Director of the National Security Agency at the time, subsequently ensured &quot;no NSA department director ever again wielded such untrammeled power.&quot;

<text>The National Security Medal is a decoration of the United States of America officially established by President Harry S. Truman in of January 19, 1953. The medal was originally awarded to any person, without regard to nationality, for distinguished achievement or outstanding contribution on or after July 26, 1947, in the field of intelligence relating to the national security of the United States.

On October 2, 2015, President Barack Obama amended Executive Order 10431 to award the medal to any person for distinguished achievement or outstanding contribution made in the field of national security through either exceptionally meritorious service performed in a position of high responsibility or through an act of heroism requiring personal courage of a high degree. Two additional sections were added to the original order. Any individual may recommend a potential recipient as a candidate for the award to the Executive Secretary of the National Security Council. If the Executive Secretary of the National Security Council determines that the medal is warranted and following approval by the President, the Executive Secretary shall notify the Office of the Director of National Intelligence who will then process the award recommendation, prepare the medal and deliver it to the National Security Council for presentation to the recipient.

The National Security Medal is authorized to both civilians and personnel of the United States military and is an authorized decoration for display on active duty uniforms of the United States armed forces. In such cases, the National Security Medal is worn after all U.S. military personal decorations and unit awards and before any military campaign/service awards and foreign decorations.

Additional decorations of the National Security Medal are denoted by a bronze oak leaf cluster.

<text>Joseph John Rochefort (May 12, 1900 – July 20, 1976) was an American naval officer and cryptanalyst. He was a major figure in the United States Navy&#x27;s cryptographic and intelligence operations from 1925 to 1946, particularly in the Battle of Midway. His contributions and those of his team were pivotal to victory in the Pacific War.

==Early career==
Rochefort was born May, 12, 1900, in Dayton, Ohio. In 1917, he joined the United States Navy while still in high school in Los Angeles, without obtaining a diploma. When enlisting he gave his birth date as 1898; this adjustment lasted his entire career. He was commissioned as an Ensign after a 14 June 1919 graduation from the US Navy&#x27;s Steam Engineering School at Stevens Institute of Technology, and later in 1919, became engineering officer of the tanker USS &quot;Cuyama&quot;.

A fellow officer observed that Rochefort had a penchant for solving crossword puzzles and adept skills at playing the advanced card game auction bridge and recommended him for a Navy cryptanalysis class in Washington, D.C.

Prior to 1941, Rochefort split his time between sea duty and cryptologic or intelligence-related assignments.

Rochefort&#x27;s tours ashore included cryptanalytic training as an assistant to Captain Laurance Safford, and work with the master codebreaker Agnes Meyer Driscoll in 1924. He then served a stint as second chief of the Division of Naval Communications&#x27; newly created cryptanalytic organization, OP-20-G, from 1926 to 1929. 

The US Navy sent him to Japan for training in the Japanese language from 1929 to 1932. He had a two-year intelligence assignment in the Eleventh Naval District, San Diego, from 1936 to 1938.

==World War II==
===Pearl Harbor===
By 1941 Rochefort was both an expert Japanese linguist and trained cryptanalyst. Early that year Laurance Safford, again chief of OP-20-G in Washington, sent him to Pearl Harbor on the island of Oahu, Territory of Hawaii, to become officer in charge of Station Hypo (&quot;H&quot; for Hawaii in the Navy&#x27;s phonetic alphabet at the time). 

Rochefort handpicked many of HYPO&#x27;s staff, and by the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor had gotten many of the Navy&#x27;s best cryptanalysts, traffic analysts, and linguists, including Joseph Finnegan. Rochefort&#x27;s team was assigned to break the Japanese Navy&#x27;s most secure cypher system, the Flag Officers Code, while Navy cryptographers at Station CAST (Cavite in the Philippines) and OP-20-G in Washington (NEGAT, &quot;N&quot; for Navy Department) concentrated on the main fleet cipher, JN-25.

Rochefort had a close working relationship with Edwin T. Layton Sr., whom he first met on the voyage to Tokyo where both men were sent to learn Japanese at the Navy&#x27;s request. In 1941, Layton was the chief intelligence officer for Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet (). Both he and Rochefort were denied access to decrypts of diplomatic messages sent in Purple, the highest level diplomatic cypher used by the Japanese Foreign Office, in the months before the Japanese attack, on the orders of the director of the War Plans Division, Richmond K. Turner.

===Battle of Midway===
After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Navy cryptographers, with assistance from both British cryptographers at the Far East Combined Bureau (in Singapore; later Colombo, Kenya, Colombo), and Dutch cryptographers (in the Dutch East Indies), combined to break enough JN-25 traffic to provide useful intelligence reports and assessments regarding Japanese force disposition and intentions in early 1942. Rochefort would often go for days without emerging from his bunker, where he and his staff spent 12 hours a day, or even longer, working to decode Japanese radio traffic. He often wore slippers and a bathrobe with his khaki uniform and sometimes went days without bathing.

Station HYPO maintained the coming Japanese attack would be in the Central Pacific, and convinced Admiral Chester W. Nimitz (who replaced Kimmel). OP-20-G (with support from Station CAST) insisted it would be elsewhere in the Pacific, probably the Aleutian Islands, possibly Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea, or even the west coast of the United States. OP-20-G, which had been restructured (Safford having been replaced by Commander John Redman, a communications officer untrained in cryptanalysis) agreed the attack was scheduled for mid-June, not late May or early June, as Rochefort maintained. Redman also said that Rochefort was being &quot;un-cooperative&quot;, and should concentrate on Admiral Ernest King, Nimitz&#x27;s superior in Washington, was persuaded by OP-20-G. Rochefort believed an unknown codegroup, AF, referred to Midway.

One of the Station HYPO staff, Jasper Holmes, had the idea of faking a failure of the water supply on Midway Island. He suggested using an unencrypted emergency warning in the hope of provoking a Japanese response, thus establishing whether Midway was a target. Rochefort took the idea to Layton, who put it to Nimitz. Nimitz approved, and the garrison commander was told by submarine cable to immediately radio in &quot;plain-language&quot; an emergency request for water as an explosion in the water desalination system meant that they had only enough water for two weeks. An apparently &quot;follow-up&quot; report was to be made in one of the strip-cipher code systems that the Japanese were known to have captured on Wake. As the plan was to convince Washington, Rochefort tactfully let Fleet Radio Unit, Melbourne (FRUMEL) notify the main objects of the deception (Washington) of the Japanese message by reporting a message from the AF Air Unit saying that they had only enough water for two weeks: &quot;This will confirm identity of AF&quot;. Rochefort then sent a reminder on Friday. 

The Japanese took the bait. Within hours they broadcast instructions to load additional water desalination equipment, confirming Rochefort&#x27;s analysis. Layton notes the instructions also &quot;produced an unexpected bonus&quot;. They revealed the assault was to come before mid-June.

In Washington, Admiral Ernest J. King, who disliked Rochefort intensely, still was not convinced, however, as to the date of the attack. The date-time data in Japanese naval messages was &quot;superenciphered,&quot; or encrypted even before it was encoded in JN-25. HYPO made their all-out effort to crack this by searching the stacks of printouts and punched cards for five-digit number sequences. After finding low-grade codes, the team set about to unravel the cipher itself. Layton credits Lieutenant Joseph Finnegan for discovering &quot;the method that the Japanese had used to lock up their date-time groups.&quot; An intercept of 26 May with orders for two destroyer groups escorting invasion transports was analyzed with this table and &quot;really clinched the pivotal date of the operation&quot; as either 4 or 5 June.

During May 1942, Rochefort and his group decrypted, translated, reviewed, analyzed, and reported as many as 140 messages per day. During the week before Nimitz issued his final orders, &quot;decrypts were being processed at the rate of five hundred to a thousand a day.&quot;

===After Midway===
When Nimitz recommended Rochefort for a Navy Distinguished Service Medal, the recommendation was rejected by King who unfairly considered Rochefort “one of the most unmilitary-looking officers he had ever encountered.” Rochefort also told Nimitz to stop the recommendation since it would only &quot;make trouble&quot;. Other sources suggest Rochefort received no official recognition during his lifetime because he was made a scapegoat for the embarrassment of OP-20-G. CDR John Redman (whose brother was the influential Rear Admiral Joseph Redman) complained to King about the operation of the Hawaii cryptologic station; as a result, Rochefort was reassigned from cryptanalysis to command the floating dry dock ABSD-2 at San Francisco. Rochefort never served at sea again. The fact that Rochefort received no higher recognition at the time is considered by some to have been an outrage and an example of King’s counterproductive personal vendettas. However, he was decorated with the Legion of Merit at the end of the War over Admiral King’s objection.

==After WWII==
Rochefort headed the Pacific Strategic Intelligence Group in Washington after the war. He died in 1976 in Torrance, California, aged 76.

==Awards==
In addition to earning the U.S. Legion of Merit at the end of World War II, Rochefort was posthumously awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal in 1985. In 1986, he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 2000, he was inducted into the National Security Agency, Central Security Service Hall of Fame.
==Legacy==
On 6 January 2012, the &quot;CAPT Joseph J. Rochefort Building&quot; was dedicated at the NSA facility within a Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam Annex, Hawaii.

==Portrayals==
In the 1976 movie &quot;Midway&quot; with Charlton Heston and Henry Fonda, Rochefort was portrayed by Hal Holbrook. Rochefort died a month after the movie premiered. In 2019 film &quot;Midway&quot;, he was portrayed by actor Brennan Brown.

<text>Gene duplication (or chromosomal duplication or gene amplification) is a major mechanism through which new genetic material is generated during molecular evolution. It can be defined as any duplication of a region of DNA that contains a gene. Gene duplications can arise as products of several types of errors in DNA replication and repair machinery as well as through fortuitous capture by selfish genetic elements. Common sources of gene duplications include ectopic recombination, retrotransposition event, aneuploidy, polyploidy, and replication slippage.

==Mechanisms of duplication==

===Ectopic recombination===
Duplications arise from an event termed unequal crossing-over that occurs during meiosis between misaligned homologous chromosomes. The chance of it happening is a function of the degree of sharing of repetitive elements between two chromosomes. The products of this recombination are a duplication at the site of the exchange and a reciprocal deletion. Ectopic recombination is typically mediated by sequence similarity at the duplicate breakpoints, which form direct repeats. Repetitive genetic elements such as transposable elements offer one source of repetitive DNA that can facilitate recombination, and they are often found at duplication breakpoints in plants and mammals.
===Replication slippage===
Replication slippage is an error in DNA replication that can produce duplications of short genetic sequences. During replication DNA polymerase begins to copy the DNA. At some point during the replication process, the polymerase dissociates from the DNA and replication stalls. When the polymerase reattaches to the DNA strand, it aligns the replicating strand to an incorrect position and incidentally copies the same section more than once. Replication slippage is also often facilitated by repetitive sequences, but requires only a few bases of similarity.

===Retrotransposition===
Retrotransposons, mainly L1, can occasionally act on cellular mRNA. Transcripts are reverse transcribed to DNA and inserted into random place in the genome, creating retrogenes. Resulting sequence usually lack introns and often contain poly(A) sequences that are also integrated into the genome. Many retrogenes display changes in gene regulation in comparison to their parental gene sequences, which sometimes results in novel functions. Retrogenes can move between different chromosomes to shape chromosomal evolution.

===Aneuploidy===
Aneuploidy occurs when nondisjunction at a single chromosome results in an abnormal number of chromosomes. Aneuploidy is often harmful and in mammals regularly leads to spontaneous abortions (miscarriages). Some aneuploid individuals are viable, for example trisomy 21 in humans, which leads to Down syndrome. Aneuploidy often alters gene dosage in ways that are detrimental to the organism; therefore, it is unlikely to spread through populations.

===Polyploidy===
Polyploidy, or &quot;whole genome duplication&quot; is a product of nondisjunction during meiosis which results in additional copies of the entire genome. Polyploidy is common in plants, but it has also occurred in animals, with two rounds of whole genome duplication (2R event) in the vertebrate lineage leading to humans. It has also occurred in the hemiascomycete yeasts ~100 mya.

After a whole genome duplication, there is a relatively short period of genome instability, extensive gene loss, elevated levels of nucleotide substitution and regulatory network rewiring. In addition, gene dosage effects play a significant role. Thus, most duplicates are lost within a short period, however, a considerable fraction of duplicates survive. Interestingly, genes involved in regulation are preferentially retained. Furthermore, retention of regulatory genes, most notably the Hox genes, has led to adaptive innovation.

Rapid evolution and functional divergence have been observed at the level of the transcription of duplicated genes, usually by point mutations in short transcription factor binding motifs. Furthermore, rapid evolution of protein phosphorylation motifs, usually embedded within rapidly evolving intrinsically disordered regions is another contributing factor for survival and rapid adaptation/neofunctionalization of duplicate genes. Thus, a link seems to exist between gene regulation (at least at the post-translational level) and genome evolution.

Polyploidy is also a well known source of speciation, as offspring, which have different numbers of chromosomes compared to parent species, are often unable to interbreed with non-polyploid organisms. Whole genome duplications are thought to be less detrimental than aneuploidy as the relative dosage of individual genes should be the same.

==As an evolutionary event==
=== Rate of gene duplication ===
Comparisons of genomes demonstrate that gene duplications are common in most species investigated. This is indicated by variable copy numbers (copy number variation) in the genome of humans or fruit flies. However, it has been difficult to measure the rate at which such duplications occur. Recent studies yielded a first direct estimate of the genome-wide rate of gene duplication in &quot;C. elegans&quot;, the first multicellular eukaryote for which such as estimate became available. The gene duplication rate in &quot;C. elegans&quot; is on the order of 10−7 duplications/gene/generation, that is, in a population of 10 million worms, one will have a gene duplication per generation. This rate is two orders of magnitude greater than the spontaneous rate of point mutation per nucleotide site in this species. Older (indirect) studies reported locus-specific duplication rates in bacteria, &quot;Drosophila&quot;, and humans ranging from 10−3 to 10−7/gene/generation.

===Neofunctionalization===

Gene duplications are an essential source of genetic novelty that can lead to evolutionary innovation. Duplication creates genetic redundancy, where the second copy of the gene is often free from selective pressure—that is, mutations of it have no deleterious effects to its host organism. If one copy of a gene experiences a mutation that affects its original function, the second copy can serve as a &#x27;spare part&#x27; and continue to function correctly. Thus, duplicate genes accumulate mutations faster than a functional single-copy gene, over generations of organisms, and it is possible for one of the two copies to develop a new and different function. Some examples of such neofunctionalization is the apparent mutation of a duplicated digestive gene in a family of ice fish into an antifreeze gene and duplication leading to a novel snake venom gene and the synthesis of 1 beta-hydroxytestosterone in pigs.

Gene duplication is believed to play a major role in evolution; this stance has been held by members of the scientific community for over 100 years. Susumu Ohno was one of the most famous developers of this theory in his classic book &quot;Evolution by gene duplication&quot; (1970). Ohno argued that gene duplication is the most important evolutionary force since the emergence of the universal common ancestor.
Major genome duplication events can be quite common. It is believed that the entire yeast genome underwent duplication about 100 million years ago. Plants are the most prolific genome duplicators. For example, wheat is hexaploid (a kind of polyploid), meaning that it has six copies of its genome.

===Subfunctionalization===

Another possible fate for duplicate genes is that both copies are equally free to accumulate degenerative mutations, so long as any defects are complemented by the other copy. This leads to a neutral &quot;subfunctionalization&quot; (a process of constructive neutral evolution) or DDC (duplication-degeneration-complementation) model, in which the functionality of the original gene is distributed among the two copies. Neither gene can be lost, as both now perform important non-redundant functions, but ultimately neither is able to achieve novel functionality.

Subfunctionalization can occur through neutral processes in which mutations accumulate with no detrimental or beneficial effects. However, in some cases subfunctionalization can occur with clear adaptive benefits. If an ancestral gene is pleiotropic and performs two functions, often neither one of these two functions can be changed without affecting the other function. In this way, partitioning the ancestral functions into two separate genes can allow for adaptive specialization of subfunctions, thereby providing an adaptive benefit.

===Loss===
Often the resulting genomic variation leads to gene dosage dependent neurological disorders such as Rett-like syndrome and Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease. Such detrimental mutations are likely to be lost from the population and will not be preserved or develop novel functions. However, many duplications are, in fact, not detrimental or beneficial, and these neutral sequences may be lost or may spread through the population through random fluctuations via genetic drift.

==Identifying duplications in sequenced genomes==

===Criteria and single genome scans===
The two genes that exist after a gene duplication event are called paralogs and usually code for proteins with a similar function and/or structure. By contrast, orthologous genes present in different species which are each originally derived from the same ancestral sequence. (See Homology of sequences in genetics).

It is important (but often difficult) to differentiate between paralogs and orthologs in biological research. Experiments on human gene function can often be carried out on other species if a homolog to a human gene can be found in the genome of that species, but only if the homolog is orthologous. If they are paralogs and resulted from a gene duplication event, their functions are likely to be too different. One or more copies of duplicated genes that constitute a gene family may be affected by insertion of transposable elements that causes significant variation between them in their sequence and finally may become responsible for divergent evolution. This may also render the chances and the rate of gene conversion between the homologs of gene duplicates due to less or no similarity in their sequences.

Paralogs can be identified in single genomes through a sequence comparison of all annotated gene models to one another. Such a comparison can be performed on translated amino acid sequences (e.g. BLASTp, tBLASTx) to identify ancient duplications or on DNA nucleotide sequences (e.g. BLASTn, megablast) to identify more recent duplications. Most studies to identify gene duplications require reciprocal-best-hits or fuzzy reciprocal-best-hits, where each paralog must be the other&#x27;s single best match in a sequence comparison.

Most gene duplications exist as low copy repeats (LCRs), rather highly repetitive sequences like transposable elements. They are mostly found in pericentronomic, subtelomeric and interstitial regions of a chromosome. Many LCRs, due to their size (&gt;1Kb), similarity, and orientation, are highly susceptible to duplications and deletions.

===Genomic microarrays detect duplications===
Technologies such as genomic microarrays, also called array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH), are used to detect chromosomal abnormalities, such as microduplications, in a high throughput fashion from genomic DNA samples. In particular, DNA microarray technology can simultaneously monitor the expression levels of thousands of genes across many treatments or experimental conditions, greatly facilitating the evolutionary studies of gene regulation after gene duplication or speciation.

===Next generation sequencing===
Gene duplications can also be identified through the use of next-generation sequencing platforms. The simplest means to identify duplications in genomic resequencing data is through the use of paired-end sequencing reads. Tandem duplications are indicated by sequencing read pairs which map in abnormal orientations. Through a combination of increased sequence coverage and abnormal mapping orientation, it is possible to identify duplications in genomic sequencing data.

==Nomenclature==

The International System for Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature (ISCN) is an international standard for human chromosome nomenclature, which includes band names, symbols and abbreviated terms used in the description of human chromosome and chromosome abnormalities. Abbreviations include &quot;dup&quot; for duplications of parts of a chromosome. For example, dup(17p12) causes Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease type 1A.

==As amplification==
Gene duplication does not necessarily constitute a lasting change in a species&#x27; genome. In fact, such changes often don&#x27;t last past the initial host organism. From the perspective of molecular genetics, gene amplification is one of many ways in which a gene can be overexpressed. Genetic amplification can occur artificially, as with the use of the polymerase chain reaction technique to amplify short strands of DNA &quot;in vitro&quot; using enzymes, or it can occur naturally, as described above. If it&#x27;s a natural duplication, it can still take place in a somatic cell, rather than a germline cell (which would be necessary for a lasting evolutionary change).

===Role in cancer===
Duplications of oncogenes are a common cause of many types of cancer. In such cases the genetic duplication occurs in a somatic cell and affects only the genome of the cancer cells themselves, not the entire organism, much less any subsequent offspring. Recent comprehensive patient-level classification and quantification of driver events in TCGA cohorts revealed that there are on average 12 driver events per tumor, of which 1.5 are amplifications of oncogenes.


Whole-genome duplications are also frequent in cancers, detected in 30% to 36% of tumors from the most common cancer types. Their exact role in carcinogenesis is unclear, but they in some cases lead to loss of chromatin segregation leading to chromatin conformation changes that in turn lead to oncogenic epigenetic and transcriptional modifications.

<text>Salak (Salacca zalacca) is a species of palm tree (family Arecaceae) native to Java and Sumatra in Indonesia. It is cultivated in other regions of Indonesia as a food crop, and reportedly naturalized in Bali, Lombok, Timor, Maluku, and Sulawesi.

It is a very short-stemmed palm, with leaves up to long; each leaf has a 2-metre long petiole with spines up to long, and numerous leaflets. The fruits grow in clusters at the base of the palm, and are also known as snake fruit or snakeskin fruit due to the reddish-brown scaly skin, which is removed before eating. The fruit, resembling a ripe fig in size and shape, has a crunchy and moist consistency. The edible pulp inside, often compared to large peeled garlic cloves in appearance, offers a unique flavor profile. It typically presents a sweet and acidic taste with a notable astringent edge, which can vary significantly among different cultivars. The most recognized cultivars include the salak pondoh from Yogyakarta, known for its sweet flavor and dry, crumbly texture, and the salak Bali, famed for its moist crunchiness. The diversity in salak cultivars leads to a range of flavors, from intensely sweet to tangy and slightly sour, making it a fruit with a complex palate.

==Cultivation==
The salak tree has been cultivated throughout Indonesia, and there are at least 30 cultivars, most of which have an astringent taste and are sweet. Two popular cultivars are &quot;salak pondoh&quot; from Yogyakarta province (found in 1980s) and &quot;salak Bali&quot; from Bali.

===Salak pondoh===
&quot;Salak pondoh&quot; is an important fruit in the Yogyakarta province on the island of Java. In the five years to 1999, the annual production in Yogyakarta doubled to 28,666 tons. Its popularity (compared with other cultivars) among local Indonesian consumers is mainly due to the intensity of its aroma and its sweet flavor even before reaching full maturity.

&quot;Salak pondoh&quot; has three more superior variations, namely &quot;pondoh super&quot;, &quot;pondoh hitam&quot; (black pondoh), and &quot;pondoh gading&quot; (ivory/yellowish-skinned pondoh).

===Salak Bali===
Believed to originate from Sibetan village, in the highlands of Bali. Salak Bali is commonly sold all over the island of Bali, and is a popular fruit with both locals and tourists.

It is the only monoecious salacca and one of the few monoecious palms in the Calameae clade.

There are more than 15 varieties of Salak Bali, with tastes ranging from sweet as sugar (Salak Gula Pasir), sweet-sour like a grapefruit (Salak Getih) and sour like a pineapple (Salak Nanas).
The fruit is roughly the size of a large fig, and has a crunchy and moist consistency. 
In some varieties the fruit has a slight astringent, starchy mouthfeel such as with Salak Gading; with other fruits such as Salak Gondok and Salak Gula Pasir, there is little to no astringency.

====Salak gula pasir====
The most expensive cultivar of the Bali salak is the &quot;gula pasir&quot; (literally &quot;sand sugar&quot; or &quot;grain sugar&quot;, referring to its fine-grainedness), which is smaller than the normal salak and is the sweetest of all salak.

As this variety of salak is known for its sweetness, it is sometimes fermented into Salak wine which has an alcohol content of 13.5 percent, similar to traditional wine made from grapes.

<doc id="477556" wikidata="Q258206" url="?curid=477556" title="Agnes Meyer Driscoll">
<text>Agnes Meyer Driscoll (July 24, 1889 – September 16, 1971), known as &quot;Miss Aggie&quot; or &quot;Madame X&#x27;&quot;, was an American
cryptanalyst during both World War I and World War II and was known as &quot;the first lady of naval cryptology.&quot;

==Early years==
Driscoll was born Agnes May Meyer in Geneseo, Illinois, in 1889. She moved with her family to Westerville, Ohio, in 1895, where her father, Gustav Meyer, had taken a job teaching music at Otterbein College. In 1909, he donated the family home to the Anti-Saloon League, which had recently moved its headquarters to Westerville. The home was later donated to the Westerville Public Library and is now home to the Anti-Saloon League Museum and the Westerville Local History Center.

==Education==
Driscoll attended Otterbein College from 1907 to 1909. In 1911, she received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Ohio State University, having majored in mathematics and physics and studied foreign languages, statistics and music. She was fluent in English, French, German, Latin and Japanese. From her earliest days as a college student, she pursued technical and scientific studies. After graduation, she moved to Amarillo, Texas, where she lived from 1911 to 1918 and worked as director of music at a military academy and, later, chair of the mathematics department at the local high school.

==1918–1939==
On June 22, 1918, about one year after America entered World War I when America had just started allowing women to enlist, Driscoll enlisted in the United States Navy. She was recruited at the highest possible rank of chief yeoman and after some time in the Postal Cable and Censorship Office she was assigned to the Code and Signal section of the Director of Naval Communications. After the war ended, she made use of an option to continue working at her post as a civilian. Except for a two-year break, when she worked for a private firm, she remained a leading cryptanalyst for the U.S. Navy until 1949.

In 1920, while continuing to work with the Navy, Driscoll studied at the Riverbank Laboratories in Geneva, Illinois, where fellow code breakers, including William F. Friedman and Elizebeth Smith Friedman worked. She is known to have also worked at the American Black Chamber run by Herbert Yardley. This was the first U.S. peace time code-breaking agency which set out to break codes used in diplomatic correspondence.

Her efforts were not limited to manual systems; she was involved also in the emerging machine technology of the time, which was being applied both to making and breaking ciphers. In her first days in the Code and Signal section, she co-developed one of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s cipher machines, the &quot;Communications Machine&quot;. This cipher machine became a standard enciphering device for the Navy for most of the 1920s. In recognition of her work, the United States Congress awarded Driscoll $15,000, which she shared with the widow of the machine&#x27;s co-inventor, William Greshem.

In 1923, the inventor Edward Hebern, creator of the fledgling Hebern Electric Code Company, was attempting to create a more secure rotor-driven cipher machine. Driscoll left the Navy to test the machine, but it failed to deliver a more secure encryption system. She returned to the Navy in spring 1924.

In August 1924, she married Michael Driscoll, a Washington, D.C. lawyer.

Driscoll, with Lieutenant Joseph Rochefort, broke the Japanese Navy manual code, the Red Book Code, in 1926 after three years of work and helped to break the Blue Book Code in 1930.

In early 1935, Driscoll led the attack on the Japanese M-1 cipher machine (also known to the U.S. as the ORANGE machine), which was used to encrypt the messages of Japanese naval attaches around the world.

In 1939, she made important inroads into JN-25, the Japanese fleet&#x27;s operational code used for the most important of messages. She successfully solved the cipher component of the &quot;5-num&quot; system which used number groups as substitutes for words and numbers which was further encrypted with a digital cipher. After that, the Navy could read some standard format messages, such as weather reports, but the bulk of the messages remained to be discovered. This work was later developed and exploited after the attack on Pearl Harbor for the rest of the Pacific War and provided advance warning of the Japanese attack on Midway Atoll. She was unable to take part in this work because, in October 1940, she was transferred to a team working to break the German naval Enigma cipher.

During this period, Driscoll mentored the following naval cryptographers:
* Joseph Rochefort
* Thomas Dyer
* Edwin T. Layton
* Joseph Wenger

==1940–1959==
After starting the work against JN-25, Driscoll was transferred to a new group, which attacked the German Enigma ciphers using a catalog approach (similar to rainbow tables). After almost two years of work on her new assignment, Driscoll and her team were unable to make progress in solving the German device. That was partly due to her unwillingness to use machine support or a mathematical approach, but she also refused the help of British code breakers from Bletchley Park who had traveled to the United States to advise her. Besides, the US and UK did not communicate effectively and her approach was both fruitless and had been tried by the British, who determined that it was unlikely to work. Ultimately this work was superseded by the US-UK cryptologic exchanges of 1942–43.

In 1943, she worked with a team to break the Japanese cipher Coral. It was broken two months later, although Driscoll is said to have had little influence on the project.

In 1945, she appears to have worked on attacking Russian ciphers.

Driscoll was part of the navy contingent that joined the new national cryptologic agencies, firstly the Armed Forces Security Agency in 1949 and then the National Security Agency in 1952. While with the Armed Forces Security Agency she may have contributed to attacking a cipher called Venona.

From 1946 until her retirement from the National Security Agency, she filled a number of positions, but she did not advance to the ranks of senior leadership.

She retired from National Security Agency in 1959.

==Death==
She died in 1971 and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Honors==
In 2000, she was inducted into the National Security Agency&#x27;s Hall of Honor.
In 2017, an Ohio Historical Marker was placed in front of the Meyer home in Westerville honoring Agnes Meyer Driscoll and her achievements, referring to her as &quot;the first lady of naval cryptology.&quot;

<doc id="477559" wikidata="Q2323549" url="?curid=477559" title="Yaiza (municipality)">
<text>Yaiza is a municipality on the island of Lanzarote in the Canary Islands, Spain. It lies in the southwest of the island and forms part of the province of Las Palmas. The municipality is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, south and east. To the north, the Timanfaya National Park is partly within the municipality. The eastern part of the municipality is mountainous and, south west of the mountains, the Rubicon plain stretches to the coast.

At the southern end of the municipality of Yaiza, in the area known as &quot;El Rubicón&quot;, the first European settlement in the Canary Islands in 1402, where the conquest of the Archipelago began he was installed. In this place there existed the Cathedral of Saint Martial of Limoges. This cathedral was destroyed by English pirates in the sixteenth century and is currently in Femés, the Hermitage of Saint Martial of Limoges dedicated to this saint. This diocese was moved in 1483 to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Roman Catholic Diocese of Canarias).

The largest town of the municipality is Playa Blanca on the south coast. The administrative centre is the much smaller town of Yaiza. The total population was 16,289 in 2018, and the area is . Yaiza is about west of the island&#x27;s capital, Arrecife.

== History ==
At the southern end of the municipality of Yaiza, in the area known as &quot;El Rubicón&quot;, the first European settlement of the Canary Islands was established in 1402, from where the Conquest of the Archipelago began. In that place was the Cathedral of San Marcial de Limoges, patron saint of Lanzarote and compatron of the Canarian Diocese.1 This cathedral was destroyed by English pirates in the sixteenth century and is currently located in Femés, the Chapel of San Marcial de Limoges dedicated to this saint.

Yaiza is on the edge of the area buried by the volcanic eruptions that took place in Lanzarote between 1730 and 1736, which gave rise to the Timanfaya National Park. Precisely, the fundamental chronicle of the eruptions was narrated by the then parish priest of Yaiza, Andrés Lorenzo Curbelo.

<doc id="477560" wikidata="Q1574319" url="?curid=477560" title="Hocking River">
<text>The Hocking River (formerly the Hockhocking River) is a right tributary of the Ohio River in southeastern Ohio in the United States.

The Hocking flows mostly on the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau, but its headwaters are in a glaciated region. It rises in Bloom Township in Fairfield County and flows generally southeastwardly through Fairfield, Hocking, and Athens counties, through the Hocking Hills region and past the cities of Lancaster, Logan, Nelsonville, Athens and Coolville. It joins the Ohio River at Hockingport. The Hocking&#x27;s tributaries also drain parts of Perry, Morgan, and Washington Counties.

Its name originally derives from a Native American name, roughly &quot;Hokhokken&quot; or &quot;Hokhochen&quot;, which meant &quot;bottle-shaped&quot; or &quot;gourd-shaped&quot; and referred to the river&#x27;s headwaters 7 miles north-west of present-day Lancaster, Ohio. The river begins as a small stream, then immediately goes over a waterfall into a wide gorge. When viewed from above, this feature looks like a bottle, which led to its name. The river was known as the Hockhocking River until the late 19th century.

The Hocking Canal once linked Athens to Lancaster and the Ohio and Erie Canal, but was destroyed by flooding and never rebuilt. Due to frequent flooding of Ohio University&#x27;s campus, the Army Corps of Engineers re-channelized a section of the Hocking River in Athens during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Between Nelsonville and Athens, the Hocking today is roughly paralleled by a rail trail, the Hockhocking Adena Bikeway. The path serves as a major source of recreation for the residents of the area, especially the students of Ohio University and Hocking College.

Major tributaries to the Hocking include (downriver to upriver) Federal Creek, Margaret Creek, Sunday Creek, Monday Creek, Scott Creek, Oldtown Creek, Clear Creek, Rush Creek, Pleasant Run, Baldwin Run, and Hunters Run. Many of these tributaries are affected by acid mine drainage.

==Recreation==
Canoeing, kayaking, rafting, and tubing are very popular activities on the Hocking River. Hocking Hills Adventures and Hocking Hills Canoe Livery each operate trips suitable for all skill levels on the mid and upper sections of the river.

The mid and upper portions of the Hocking River serve as an above-average smallmouth bass fishery. Typical species of midwestern warm-water streams are generally found throughout the river.

The Hocking River Water Trail is now under development. There are currently river access points for fishing and for canoes and kayaks at Logan, Ohio, at Hocking College at Nelsonville, Ohio, on Hamley Run Road northwest of The Plains, Ohio, at West State Street Park in Athens, Ohio, at County Road 24A near Canaanville, Ohio, and at the Army Corps of Engineers&#x27; Belleville Locks and Dam recreational access point on Frost Road near Coolville, Ohio.

It is spanned by the Rock Mill Covered Bridge.

==Nonprofit organizations==
Two organizations particularly concerned with preserving the environment of the river and its adjacent lands, and with providing recreational access to the river, are: the Hocking River Commission, based in Athens County, Ohio, and the Friends of the Hocking River, based in Hocking County, Ohio. Friends of the Hocking River in conjunction with Hocking Hills Adventures sponsor an annual river cleanup. The event is usually held on the second Saturday in June and it concludes with a BBQ and music.

==Variant names==
The Shawnee language name is Wi&#x27;thakakkwathiipi.

According to the Geographic Names Information System, the Hocking River has also been known as:
* Big Hock-hocking River
* Great Hock-hocking River 
* Hock-Hocking River
* Hockhocken River 
* Hockhocking River 
* Hocking Hocking River 
* Hokhoking River 
* Big Hockhocking River 
* Big Hocking River 
* Great Hockhocking River
* Hakhakkien River 
* Hockhoking River

The form &quot;Hockhocking&quot; was generally used for the first century of Ohio&#x27;s statehood, as reflected on old maps, while the shorter &quot;Hocking&quot; River form has been used for about the past century.
==Flooding==
Flooding on the Hocking used to be a yearly occurrence for the residents of Athens, Ohio. The floods determined many aspects of the residents&#x27; lives, for example where to build a house. Most of the houses in Athens are built up on the hills, or the higher ground. It was not until the university needed to expand, due to an influx of students during the 1950s that anything was even built into the flood plain. Some mentionable floods included the 1907 flood, in which seven people died, and about twenty houses were swept away. Another notable flood took place in 1968 which was labeled &quot;The worst flood in fifty five years&quot;. The 1968 flood is also of interest due to the fact that the re-routing of the Hocking River project began in 1969. The re-routing of the Hocking was undertaken by the US Army Corps of Engineers, and was paid for by the university. The project was completed by 1971 and reverted five miles of the river along the West Green.

===Flood of 1907===
This flood took place on March 14, 1907, and caused extensive damage throughout Athens and SE Ohio. According to the Athens Journal, seven people died during the flood and the rescue attempts which followed. The flood uprooted about twenty houses, as well as drowned countless heads of horse and cattle. Residents who owned rowboats spent the days after the flood rescuing as many people as possible from their flooded houses; many people were saved, but rescuers were among the seven people who died. Thousands of people were forced to leave their homes, and many people were arrested for looting in the days after the flood. Telegraph lines were ripped down due to the flood, leaving Athens residents with no way of communicating with the outside world in the days after the flood. The railroad, waterworks plant, and electric plant were flooded, leaving Athens residents without water or electricity.

===Flood of 1968===
The Flood of 1968 caused more severe damage. Four inches of rain fell in twenty-four hours, causing the river to crest at twenty-five feet, eight feet above flood level. Students actually helped the National Guardsmen in rescue efforts and sandbagging in an attempt to control the flooding. The flood made national news, worrying parents and relatives who were tuning in. Students were also seen diving off the balcony in front of Brown Hall, and out dorm windows on the West Green. It was reportedly the worst flood in fifty-five years, and caused $8.9 million in damage to Athens county, and $750,000 to Ohio Universities campus.

===Re-routing project===
A year after the 1968 flood the re-routing project began. The project was carried out by the Army Corps of Engineers, and was funded by Ohio University. The University needed to expand its campus into the flood plain without having to pay annual damages, and without putting students at risk. So the re-routing project, which had been proposed years earlier, became one of the only viable solutions for the university&#x27;s dilemma. It has been speculated that the new river channel has three times the carrying capacity of the old one, and should reduce chances of flooding by 86%, preventing an estimated $800,000 annual flood loss. The project began on April 12, 1969. It was estimated to cost $11 million, and was to re-route a five-mile strip of river that ran along the West Green. Also, a four-laned bridge was constructed along Richland Ave, which can still be seen today. The project was completed by 1971, and OU reportedly paid $375,000 per year for twenty-two years. The project had a lasting effect on the campus of OU; the pre-1969 Hocking would have run directly through the bottom floor of the new Baker Center. US Army Corps has estimated that since the project was completed, $48 million in flood damage has been averted since completion. The project was put to the test in May 1990 when heavy rains caused the river to crest at twenty- three feet in Athens. President Bush declared Athens and three other counties &quot;Disaster Areas&quot;; the flood caused $4 million in damage to SE Ohio, but physical plant director Chuck Culp estimated that rerouting the river saved OU more than $500,000 in flood damage. The most visible change to Athens due to the rerouting project was the building of Baker Center. Baker Center is built right in the original flood plain of the Hocking river; the second floor of Baker would actually be stream level.

==Namesakes==
The Hocking Valley Railway was formed in 1870. Today, the Hocking Valley Scenic Railway still runs as a tourist attraction.

Hocking County, Ohio is named after the river, as are the Hocking Hills, which include Hocking State Forest and Hocking Hills State Park.

The Hocking Canal existed from 1838-1890.

Hocking College is a technical college located at Nelsonville, Ohio.

The Hocking Glass Company was formed in 1905, and merged to become Anchor Hocking by 1937.

General Hocking Brick Company, Hocking Iron Company, Hocking Valley Products Company and Hocking Valley Clay Company were all former manufacturers in the area.

The Hocking River&#x27;s name was the inspiration for the call letters of Lancaster&#x27;s Country music radio station WHOK-FM (now WXMG).

<doc id="477567" wikidata="Q13365776" url="?curid=477567" title="Uremia">
<text>Uremia is the condition of having high levels of urea in the blood. Urea is one of the primary components of urine. It can be defined as an excess in the blood of amino acid and protein metabolism end products, such as urea and creatinine, which would normally be excreted in the urine. &quot;Uremic syndrome&quot; can be defined as the terminal clinical manifestation of kidney failure (also called &quot;renal failure&quot;). It is the signs, symptoms and results from laboratory tests which result from inadequate excretory, regulatory, and endocrine function of the kidneys. Both &quot;uremia&quot; and &quot;uremic syndrome&quot; have been used interchangeably to denote a very high plasma urea concentration that is the result of renal failure. The former denotation will be used for the rest of the article.

Azotemia is a similar, less severe condition with high levels of urea, where the abnormality can be measured chemically but is not yet so severe as to produce symptoms. Uremia describes the pathological and symptomatic manifestations of severe azotemia.

There is no specific time for the onset of uremia for people with progressive loss of kidney function. People with kidney function below 50% (i.e. a glomerular filtration rate [GFR] between 50 and 60 mL/min) and over 30 years of age may have uremia to a degree. This means an estimated 8 million people in the United States with a GFR of less than 60 mL/min have uremic symptoms. The symptoms, such as fatigue, can be very vague, making the diagnosis of impaired kidney function difficult. Treatment can be by dialysis or a kidney transplant, though some patients choose to pursue symptom control and conservative care instead.

==Signs and symptoms==
Classical signs of uremia are: progressive weakness and easy fatigue, loss of appetite due to nausea and vomiting, muscle atrophy, tremors, abnormal mental function, frequent shallow respiration, and metabolic acidosis. Without intervention via dialysis or kidney transplant, uremia due to renal failure will progress and cause stupor, coma, and death. Because uremia is mostly a consequence of kidney failure, its signs and symptoms often occur concomitantly with other signs and symptoms of kidney failure.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measures the amount of plasma in millilitres being filtered through the kidneys each minute. As the GFR decreases, the prognosis worsens. Some of the effects can be reversed, albeit temporarily, with dialysis.
===Residual syndrome===
People on dialysis acquire what is known as &quot;residual syndrome&quot;. Residual syndrome is a non-life-threatening disease which is displayed as toxic effects causing many of the same signs and symptoms that uremia displays. There are several hypotheses why residual syndrome is present. They are: the accumulation of large molecular weight solutes that are poorly dialyzed (e.g. β2-microglobulin); the accumulation of protein-bound small molecular weight solutes that are poorly dialyzed (e.g., &quot;p&quot;-cresol sulfate and indoxyl sulfate); the accumulation of dialyzable solutes that are incompletely removed (e.g., sequestered solutes like phosphate in cells, or insufficient elimination of other more toxic solutes); indirect phenomena such as carbamylation of proteins, tissue calcification, or a toxic effect of hormone imbalance (e.g., parathyroid hormone) and; the toxic effects of dialysis itself (e.g., removal of unknown important vitamins or minerals). Dialysis increases life span, but patients may have more limited function. They have physical limitations which include impairment of balance, walking speed, and sensory functions. They also have cognitive impairments such as impairment in attention, memory, and performance of higher-order tasks. Patients have been maintained longer than three decades on dialysis, but average mortality rates and hospitalizations are high. Also, patient rehabilitation and quality of life is poor.

==Causes==

Conditions causing increased blood urea fall into three different categories: prerenal, renal, and postrenal.

Prerenal azotemia can be caused by decreased blood flow through the kidneys (e.g. low blood pressure, congestive heart failure, shock, bleeding, dehydration) or by increased production of urea in the liver via a high protein diet or increased protein catabolism (e.g. stress, fever, major illness, corticosteroid therapy, or gastrointestinal bleeding).

Renal causes can be attributed to decreased kidney function. These include acute and chronic kidney failure, acute and chronic glomerulonephritis, tubular necrosis, and other kidney diseases.

Postrenal causes can be due to decreased elimination of urea. These could be due to urinary outflow obstruction such as by calculi, tumours of the bladder or prostate, or a severe infection.

==Diagnosis==
A detailed and accurate history and physical examination will help determine if uremia is acute or chronic. In the cases of acute uremia, causes may be identified and eliminated, leading to a higher chance for recovery of normal kidney function, if treated correctly.

===Blood tests===
Primary tests performed for the diagnosis of uremia are basic metabolic panel with serum calcium and phosphorus to evaluate the GFR, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine as well as serum potassium, phosphate, calcium and sodium levels. The principal abnormality is very low GFR (&lt;30 mL/min). Uremia will demonstrate elevation of both urea and creatinine, likely elevated potassium, high phosphate and normal or slightly high sodium, as well as likely depressed calcium levels. As a basic work up a physician will also evaluate for anemia, and thyroid and parathyroid functions. Chronic anemia may be an ominous sign of established renal failure. The thyroid and parathyroid panels will help work up any symptoms of fatigue, as well as determine calcium abnormalities as they relate to uremia versus longstanding or unrelated illness of calcium metabolism.

===Urine tests===
A 24-hour urine collection for determination of creatinine clearance may be an alternative, although not a very accurate test due to the collection procedure. Another laboratory test that should be considered is urinalysis with microscopic examination for the presence of protein, casts, blood and pH.

===Radioisotope tests===
The most trusted test for determining GFR is iothalamate clearance. However, it may be cost-prohibitive and time-consuming. Clinical laboratories generally calculate the GFR with the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula or the Cockcroft-Gault formula.

===Other===
In addition, coagulation studies may indicate prolonged bleeding time with otherwise normal values.

==Mechanism==
Uremia results in many different compounds being retained by the body. With the failure of the kidneys, these compounds can build up to dangerous levels. There are more than 90 different compounds that have been identified. Some of these compounds can be toxic to the body.
===Uremic toxins===

Uremic toxins are any biologically active compounds that are retained due to kidney impairment. Many uremic salts can also be uremic toxins.

Urea was one of the first metabolites identified. Its removal is directly related to patient survival but its effect on the body is not yet clear. Still, it is not certain that the symptoms currently associated with uremia are actually caused by excess urea, as one study showed that uremic symptoms were relieved by initiation of dialysis, even when urea was added to the dialysate to maintain the blood urea nitrogen level at approximately 90 mg per deciliter (that is, approximately 32 mmol per liter). Urea could be the precursor of more toxic molecules, but it is more likely that damage done to the body is from a combination of different compounds which may act as enzyme inhibitors or derange membrane transport. Indoxyl sulfate is one of the better characterized uremic toxins. Indoxyl sulfate has been shown to aggravate vascular inflammation in atherosclerosis by modulating macrophage behavior.

===Biochemical characteristics===
Many regulatory functions of the body are affected. Regulation of body fluids, salt retention, acid and nitrogenous metabolite excretion are all impaired and can fluctuate widely. Body fluid regulation is impaired due to a failure to excrete fluids, or due to fluid loss from vomiting or diarrhea. Regulation of salt is impaired when salt intake is low or the vascular volume is inadequate. Acid excretion and nitrogenous metabolite excretion are impaired with the loss of kidney function.
==History==
Urea was crystallized and identified between 1797 and 1808. Urea was hypothesized to be the source of urinary ammonia during this time and was confirmed in 1817. It was hypothesized that excess urea may lead to specific disorders. Later in 1821, it was confirmed that the body did produce urea and that it was excreted by the kidneys. In 1827, urea was first synthesized in the lab, confirming the composition of urea and making it the first biological substance synthesized. In 1856, urea was produced &quot;in vitro&quot; via oxidation of proteins. It was in 1827 that Henri Dutrochet seeded the idea of dialysis with the discovery of separating smaller molecules from larger molecules through a semipermeable membrane. It was in 1829 and 1831 when convincing proof was obtained that in certain patients, blood urea was elevated. They also suggested that harm may be caused by this. Later research suggested that major neurological disorders like coma and convulsions did not correlate with physical findings which included generalized edema of the brain. This suggested that uremia was a form of blood poisoning. In 1851, E.T. Frerich described clinical uremic syndrome and suggested that a toxicity was the mechanism of its cause. It was in 1856 that J. Picard developed a sensitive method to reproducibly measure blood urea. He was able to detect a 40% decrease of urea concentration between the renal artery and the renal vein. This work solidified the fact that renal failure coincided with an increase in blood urea. It was J. Picard with E.T. Frerich&#x27;s work that made the term &quot;uremia&quot; popular.

== Oral manifestations ==
Oral symptoms of uremia can be found in up to 90% of renal patients. The patients may present with ammonia-like taste and smell in mouth, stomatitis, gingivitis, decreased salivary flow, xerostomia and parotitis.

One of the early symptoms of renal failure is uremic fetor. It is an ammonia odour in the mouth caused by the high concentration of urea in the saliva, which subsequently breaks down to ammonia. As the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level increases, patients might develop uremic stomatitis. Uremic stomatitis appears as a pseudo membrane or frank ulcerations with redness and a pultaceous coat in the mouth. These lesions could be related to high BUN level (&gt;150mg/dL), and disappear spontaneously when the BUN level is reduced with medical treatment. It is believed to be caused by loss of tissue resistance and failure to withstand traumatic influences. Besides that, the patient may develop a rare manifestation called uremic frost. It is a white plaque found on the skin or in the mouth which is caused by residual urea crystals left on the epithelial surface after perspiration and saliva evaporation, or as a result of reduced salivary flow. Xerostomia is a common oral finding. It results from a combination of direct involvement of salivary glands, chemical inflammation, dehydration and mouth breathing. It may be due to restricted fluid intake, an adverse effect of drug therapy, or low salivary rate. Salivary swelling can also be seen in some cases.

In patients with renal disease, pallor of the oral mucosa can sometimes be noticed due to anaemia caused by reduction of erythropoietin. Uraemia can lead to alteration of platelet aggregation. This situation, combined with the use of heparin and other anticoagulants in haemodialysis, causes these patients to become predisposed to ecchymosis, petechiae, and haemorrhages in the oral cavity. It can also lead to mucositis and glossitis, which can bring about pain and inflammation of the tongue and oral mucosa. In addition, patients might also experience altered taste sensations (dysgeusia) and be predisposed to bacterial and candidiasis infections. Candidiasis is more frequent in renal transplant patients because of generalized immunosuppression.

In children with renal disease, enamel hypoplasia of the primary and permanent dentition has been observed. The abnormalities of dental development correlate with the age at which metabolic disturbances occur. For example, enamel hypoplasia in the form of white or brown discoloration of primary teeth is commonly seen in young children with early-onset renal disease. Poor oral hygiene, a carbohydrate-rich diet, disease-related debilitation, hypoplastic enamel, low salivary flow rate and long-term medication contribute to increased risk of cavity formation. However, the patients usually have low cavity activity, particularly in children. This is due to the presence of highly buffered and alkaline saliva caused by the high concentration of urea nitrogen and phosphate in saliva. The salivary pH will usually be above the critical pH level for demineralization of the enamel to occur, and this helps to prevent the formation of cavities. Besides that, pulpal narrowing and calcifications are a frequent finding in patients with renal disease. For patients who are on dialysis, the nausea and vomiting resulting from dialysis treatment may lead to severe tooth erosion.

== Dental considerations ==
When treating patients with renal insufficiency, a dentist should collect a complete medical history, with particular attention to ESRD-related illnesses, drugs with prescribed dosages, blood parameters, timing, and type of dialysis performed. These aspects can be directly discussed with the nephrologist when necessary. Any alterations in drugs or other aspects of treatment must be previously agreed upon by the nephrologist.

Dental examination for such patients consists of a non-invasive complete assessment of dental, periodontal, and mucosal tissues, with radiographs to aid with the diagnostic process. All potential foci of infection should be intercepted; these include periodontal and endodontic lesions, residual roots, partially erupted and malpositioned third molars, peri-implantitis, and mucosal lesions. When periodontitis is suspected, a periodontal chart should be recorded. Orthodontic appliances can be maintained if they do not interfere with oral hygiene.

Uremia is commonly seen in patients who undergo dialysis due to renal insufficiency. For hemodialysis patients, it is important to determine the treatment schedule. Dental treatment should be started on the day after hemodialysis due to several reasons: there is no accumulation of uremic toxins in the blood, and circulating heparin is absent. Treatment should not commence on the same day as hemodialysis as patients usually feel unwell and their blood is heparinized, which might cause excessive bleeding. For patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, there are no contraindications to dental treatment except in cases of acute peritoneal infections, where elective procedure should be deferred.

Special care should be taken when positioning the patient, avoiding compression of the arm with the vascular access for hemodialysis. Any injections or blood pressure measurement should not be performed on an arm with an arteriovenous (AV) fistula. If the AV site is located on a leg, the patient should avoid sitting for lengthy periods, as venous drainage may be obstructed. During long dental procedures, the dentist should allow patients with AV sites on their legs to take a brief walk or stand for a while every hour.

Hemostatic aids should be instituted in cases of excessive bleeding, which is commonly seen in uremia and renal failure. To manage postoperative bleeding, primary closure techniques and local hemostatic agents should be used routinely. To reduce bleeding during and after a procedure, tranexamic acid, both as a rinse or administered orally, can be used.

Patients undergoing dialysis are exposed to numerous transfusions and renal failure-related immunosuppression; thus, they are at greater risks of infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis types B and C. It is important to adopt infection control measures to avoid cross-contamination in the dental clinic and prevent risk of exposure to dental personnel.

A majority of medications are eliminated from the body at least partially by the kidney. Due to renal failure, the plasma half-lives of drugs normally excreted in urine will be prolonged, leading to increased toxicity. Many drugs which are normally safely administered cannot be given to patients with reduced renal function. Besides, some drugs can be given, but the dosage must be reduced. However, in patients undergoing dialysis, reduced plasma half-lives of drugs will be observed. Antibiotics of the aminoglycoside and tetracycline families need to be avoided due to their nephrotoxicities. The antibiotics of choice are penicillins, clindamycin, and cephalosporins, which can be administered at normal doses even if the therapeutic range will be extended. For analgesics, paracetamol is the option of choice for cases of episodic pain. Aspirin is characterized by an anti-platelet activity and thus its use should be avoided in uremic patients. The challenge in pharmacotherapy for patients with renal disease is to maintain a medication&#x27;s therapeutic level within a narrow range in order to avoid subtherapeutic dosing and toxicity.

<text>In data mining and statistics, hierarchical clustering (also called hierarchical cluster analysis or HCA) is a method of cluster analysis that seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters. Strategies for hierarchical clustering generally fall into two categories:
* Agglomerative: This is a &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach: Each observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy.
* Divisive: This is a &quot;top-down&quot; approach: All observations start in one cluster, and splits are performed recursively as one moves down the hierarchy.

In general, the merges and splits are determined in a greedy manner. The results of hierarchical clustering are usually presented in a dendrogram.

Hierarchical clustering has the distinct advantage that any valid measure of distance can be used. In fact, the observations themselves are not required: all that is used is a matrix of distances. On the other hand, except for the special case of single-linkage distance, none of the algorithms (except exhaustive search in formula_1) can be guaranteed to find the optimum solution.

== Complexity ==
The standard algorithm for hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) has a time complexity of formula_2 and requires formula_3 memory, which makes it too slow for even medium data sets. However, for some special cases, optimal efficient agglomerative methods (of complexity formula_4) are known: SLINK for single-linkage and CLINK for complete-linkage clustering. With a heap, the runtime of the general case can be reduced to formula_5, an improvement on the aforementioned bound of formula_2, at the cost of further increasing the memory requirements. In many cases, the memory overheads of this approach are too large to make it practically usable. Methods exist which use quadtrees that demonstrate formula_4 total running time with formula_8 space.

Divisive clustering with an exhaustive search is formula_1, but it is common to use faster heuristics to choose splits, such as &quot;k&quot;-means.

== Cluster Linkage ==
In order to decide which clusters should be combined (for agglomerative), or where a cluster should be split (for divisive), a measure of dissimilarity between sets of observations is required. In most methods of hierarchical clustering, this is achieved by use of an appropriate distance &quot;d&quot;, such as the Euclidean distance, between &quot;single&quot; observations of the data set, and a linkage criterion, which specifies the dissimilarity of &quot;sets&quot; as a function of the pairwise distances of observations in the sets. The choice of metric as well as linkage can have a major impact on the result of the clustering, where the lower level metric determines which objects are most similar, whereas the linkage criterion influences the shape of the clusters. For example, complete-linkage tends to produce more spherical clusters than single-linkage.

The linkage criterion determines the distance between sets of observations as a function of the pairwise distances between observations.

Some commonly used linkage criteria between two sets of observations &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; and a distance &quot;d&quot; are:

Some of these can only be recomputed recursively (WPGMA, WPGMC), for many a recursive computation with Lance-Williams-equations is more efficient, while for other (Hausdorff, Medoid) the distances have to be computed with the slower full formula. Other linkage criteria include:

* The probability that candidate clusters spawn from the same distribution function (V-linkage).
* The product of in-degree and out-degree on a k-nearest-neighbour graph (graph degree linkage).
* The increment of some cluster descriptor (i.e., a quantity defined for measuring the quality of a cluster) after merging two clusters.

== Agglomerative clustering example ==

For example, suppose this data is to be clustered, and the Euclidean distance is the distance metric.

The hierarchical clustering dendrogram would be:

Cutting the tree at a given height will give a partitioning clustering at a selected precision. In this example, cutting after the second row (from the top) of the dendrogram will yield clusters {a} {b c} {d e} {f}. Cutting after the third row will yield clusters {a} {b c} {d e f}, which is a coarser clustering, with a smaller number but larger clusters.

This method builds the hierarchy from the individual elements by progressively merging clusters. In our example, we have six elements {a} {b} {c} {d} {e} and {f}. The first step is to determine which elements to merge in a cluster. Usually, we want to take the two closest elements, according to the chosen distance.

Optionally, one can also construct a distance matrix at this stage, where the number in the &quot;i&quot;-th row &quot;j&quot;-th column is the distance between the &quot;i&quot;-th and &quot;j&quot;-th elements. Then, as clustering progresses, rows and columns are merged as the clusters are merged and the distances updated. This is a common way to implement this type of clustering, and has the benefit of caching distances between clusters. A simple agglomerative clustering algorithm is described in the single-linkage clustering page; it can easily be adapted to different types of linkage (see below).

Suppose we have merged the two closest elements &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;, we now have the following clusters {&quot;a&quot;}, {&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;}, {&quot;d&quot;}, {&quot;e&quot;} and {&quot;f&quot;}, and want to merge them further. To do that, we need to take the distance between {a} and {b c}, and therefore define the distance between two clusters.
Usually the distance between two clusters formula_10 and formula_11 is one of the following:
* The maximum distance between elements of each cluster (also called complete-linkage clustering):
::formula_12
* The minimum distance between elements of each cluster (also called single-linkage clustering):
::formula_13
* The mean distance between elements of each cluster (also called average linkage clustering, used e.g. in UPGMA):
::formula_14
* The sum of all intra-cluster variance.
* The increase in variance for the cluster being merged (Ward&#x27;s method)
* The probability that candidate clusters spawn from the same distribution function (V-linkage).

In case of tied minimum distances, a pair is randomly chosen, thus being able to generate several structurally different dendrograms. Alternatively, all tied pairs may be joined at the same time, generating a unique dendrogram.

One can always decide to stop clustering when there is a sufficiently small number of clusters (number criterion). Some linkages may also guarantee that agglomeration occurs at a greater distance between clusters than the previous agglomeration, and then one can stop clustering when the clusters are too far apart to be merged (distance criterion). However, this is not the case of, e.g., the centroid linkage where the so-called reversals (inversions, departures from ultrametricity) may occur.

== Divisive clustering ==

The basic principle of divisive clustering was published as the DIANA (DIvisive ANAlysis clustering) algorithm. Initially, all data is in the same cluster, and the largest cluster is split until every object is separate.
Because there exist formula_15 ways of splitting each cluster, heuristics are needed. DIANA chooses the object with the maximum average dissimilarity and then moves all objects to this cluster that are more similar to the new cluster than to the remainder.

Informally, DIANA is not so much a process of &quot;dividing&quot; as it is of &quot;hollowing out&quot;: each iteration, an existing cluster (e.g. the initial cluster of the entire dataset) is chosen to form a new cluster inside of it. Objects progressively move to this nested cluster, and hollow out the existing cluster. Eventually, all that&#x27;s left inside a cluster is nested clusters that grew there, without it owning any loose objects by itself.

Formally, DIANA operates in the following steps:

# Let formula_16 be the set of all formula_17 object indices and formula_18 the set of all formed clusters so far.
# Iterate the following until formula_19:
## Find the current cluster with 2 or more objects that has the largest diameter: formula_20
## Find the object in this cluster with the most dissimilarity to the rest of the cluster: formula_21, then either stop iterating when formula_22, or migrate formula_23.
## Add formula_24 to formula_25.

Intuitively, formula_26 above measures how strongly an object wants to leave its current cluster, but it is attenuated when the object wouldn&#x27;t fit in the splinter group either. Such objects will likely start their own splinter group eventually.

The dendrogram of DIANA can be constructed by letting the splinter group formula_24 be a child of the hollowed-out cluster formula_28 each time. This constructs a tree with formula_29 as its root and formula_17 unique single-object clusters as its leaves.

<doc id="477578" wikidata="Q1306095" url="?curid=477578" title="Whitney embedding theorem">
<text>In mathematics, particularly in differential topology, there are two Whitney embedding theorems, named after Hassler Whitney:

*The strong Whitney embedding theorem states that any smooth real -dimensional manifold (required also to be Hausdorff and second-countable) can be smoothly embedded in the real -space, if . This is the best linear bound on the smallest-dimensional Euclidean space that all -dimensional manifolds embed in, as the real projective spaces of dimension cannot be embedded into real -space if is a power of two (as can be seen from a characteristic class argument, also due to Whitney).
*The weak Whitney embedding theorem states that any continuous function from an -dimensional manifold to an -dimensional manifold may be approximated by a smooth embedding provided . Whitney similarly proved that such a map could be approximated by an immersion provided . This last result is sometimes called the [[Whitney immersion theorem]].

==About the proof==

=== Weak embedding theorem ===
The weak Whitney embedding is proved through a projection argument.

When the manifold is &quot;compact&quot;, one can first use a covering by finitely many local charts and then reduce the dimension with suitable projections.

=== Strong embedding theorem ===
The general outline of the proof is to start with an immersion with transverse self-intersections. These are known to exist from Whitney&#x27;s earlier work on the weak immersion theorem. Transversality of the double points follows from a general-position argument. The idea is to then somehow remove all the self-intersections. If has boundary, one can remove the self-intersections simply by isotoping into itself (the isotopy being in the domain of ), to a submanifold of that does not contain the double-points. Thus, we are quickly led to the case where has no boundary. Sometimes it is impossible to remove the double-points via an isotopy—consider for example the figure-8 immersion of the circle in the plane. In this case, one needs to introduce a local double point. Once one has two opposite double points, one constructs a closed loop connecting the two, giving a closed path in Since is simply connected, one can assume this path bounds a disc, and provided one can further assume (by the weak Whitney embedding theorem) that the disc is embedded in such that it intersects the image of only in its boundary. Whitney then uses the disc to create a 1-parameter family of immersions, in effect pushing across the disc, removing the two double points in the process. In the case of the figure-8 immersion with its introduced double-point, the push across move is quite simple (pictured). This process of eliminating opposite sign double-points by pushing the manifold along a disc is called the Whitney Trick.

To introduce a local double point, Whitney created immersions which are approximately linear outside of the unit ball, but containing a single double point. For such an immersion is given by

:formula_1

Notice that if is considered as a map to like so:

:formula_2

then the double point can be resolved to an embedding:

:formula_3

Notice and for then as a function of , is an embedding.

For higher dimensions , there are that can be similarly resolved in For an embedding into for example, define

:formula_4

This process ultimately leads one to the definition:

:formula_5

where

:formula_6

The key properties of is that it is an embedding except for the double-point . Moreover, for large, it is approximately the linear embedding .

===Eventual consequences of the Whitney trick===
The Whitney trick was used by Stephen Smale to prove the &quot;h&quot;-cobordism theorem; from which follows the Poincaré conjecture in dimensions , and the classification of smooth structures on discs (also in dimensions 5 and up). This provides the foundation for surgery theory, which classifies manifolds in dimension 5 and above.

Given two oriented submanifolds of complementary dimensions in a simply connected manifold of dimension ≥ 5, one can apply an isotopy to one of the submanifolds so that all the points of intersection have the same sign.

==History==

The occasion of the proof by Hassler Whitney of the embedding theorem for smooth manifolds is said (rather surprisingly) to have been the first complete exposition of the &quot;manifold concept&quot; precisely because it brought together and unified the differing concepts of manifolds at the time: no longer was there any confusion as to whether abstract manifolds, intrinsically defined via charts, were any more or less general than manifolds extrinsically defined as submanifolds of Euclidean space. See also the history of manifolds and varieties for context.

==Sharper results==
Although every -manifold embeds in one can frequently do better. Let denote the smallest integer so that all compact connected -manifolds embed in Whitney&#x27;s strong embedding theorem states that . For we have , as the circle and the Klein bottle show. More generally, for we have , as the -dimensional real projective space show. Whitney&#x27;s result can be improved to unless is a power of 2. This is a result of André Haefliger and Morris Hirsch (for ) and C. T. C. Wall (for ); these authors used important preliminary results and particular cases proved by Hirsch, William S. Massey, Sergey Novikov and Vladimir Rokhlin. At present the function is not known in closed-form for all integers (compare to the Whitney immersion theorem, where the analogous number is known).

===Restrictions on manifolds===
One can strengthen the results by putting additional restrictions on the manifold. For example, the -sphere always embeds in  – which is the best possible (closed -manifolds cannot embed in ). Any compact &quot;orientable&quot; surface and any compact surface &quot;with non-empty boundary&quot; embeds in though any &quot;closed non-orientable&quot; surface needs 

If is a compact orientable -dimensional manifold, then embeds in (for not a power of 2 the orientability condition is superfluous). For a power of 2 this is a result of André Haefliger and Morris Hirsch (for ), and Fuquan Fang (for ); these authors used important preliminary results proved by Jacques Boéchat and Haefliger, Simon Donaldson, Hirsch and William S. Massey. Haefliger proved that if is a compact -dimensional -connected manifold, then embeds in provided .

==Isotopy versions==
A relatively &#x27;easy&#x27; result is to prove that any two embeddings of a 1-manifold into are isotopic (see Knot theory#Higher dimensions). This is proved using general position, which also allows to show that any two embeddings of an -manifold into are isotopic. This result is an isotopy version of the weak Whitney embedding theorem.

Wu proved that for , any two embeddings of an -manifold into are isotopic. This result is an isotopy version of the strong Whitney embedding theorem.

As an isotopy version of his embedding result, Haefliger proved that if is a compact -dimensional -connected manifold, then any two embeddings of into are isotopic provided . The dimension restriction is sharp: Haefliger went on to give examples of non-trivially embedded 3-spheres in (and, more generally, -spheres in ). See further generalizations.

<doc id="477579" wikidata="Q153227" url="?curid=477579" title="The Jeffersons">
<text>The Jeffersons is an American sitcom television series that was broadcast on CBS from January 18, 1975, to July 2, 1985. Lasting 11 seasons and a total of 253 episodes, &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; is one of the longest-running sitcoms in history.

==Premise==
The show focuses on George and Louise Jefferson, a prosperous black couple who have been able to move from Queens to Manhattan owing to the success of George&#x27;s dry-cleaning chain, Jefferson Cleaners. The show was launched as the second (and longest running) spin-off of &quot;All in the Family&quot; (after &quot;Maude&quot;), on which the Jeffersons had been the neighbors of Archie and Edith Bunker. The show was the creation of Norman Lear. &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; eventually evolved into more of a traditional sitcom, but episodes occasionally focused on serious issues such as alcoholism, racism, suicide, gun control, being transgender, the KKK, and adult illiteracy. The epithets &quot;nigger&quot; and &quot;honky&quot; were used occasionally, especially during the earlier seasons.

&quot;The Jeffersons&quot; had one spin-off, titled &quot;Checking In.&quot; The series was centered on the Jeffersons&#x27; housekeeper, Florence, who takes a job as cleaning management at a hotel. &quot;Checking In&quot; lasted only four episodes, after which Florence returned to &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; with the story that the hotel had burned down in a fire. &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; also shared continuity with the sitcom &quot;E/R&quot;, which featured Lynne Moody, who made a guest appearance in one episode of &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;. Sherman Hemsley guest-starred as George in two episodes of the series, which lasted for one season. The cancellation of &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; cleared the way for Marla Gibbs, who played Florence Johnston on the series, to move on to the NBC sitcom &quot;227&quot; in the fall of 1985, a year earlier than scheduled.

&quot;The Jeffersons&quot; ended in controversy after CBS abruptly canceled the series without allowing for a proper series finale. The cast was not informed until after the July 2, 1985, episode, &quot;Red Robins&quot;; actor Sherman Hemsley, who portrayed George Jefferson, said he learned that the show was canceled by reading it in the newspaper. Isabel Sanford (Louise Jefferson), who heard about the cancellation through her cousin who read it in the tabloids, publicly stated that she found the cancellation with no proper finale to be disrespectful on the network&#x27;s part. Per an article in the May 8, 1985, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the series was cancelled by announcement at the CBS network &quot;upfront&quot; presentation the day before, nearly two months before the airing of the final episode. Actor Franklin Cover, who played Tom Willis, also heard about the cancellation while watching &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;.

The cast reunited in a stage play based on the sitcom. In season 5 episode 17 of &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, titled &quot;Will Is from Mars&quot; (1995), the Jeffersons made a guest appearance as a couple in therapy class. In the 1996 series finale of &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, the Jeffersons made a guest appearance as the buyers of the Banks family house. In an episode of &quot;Tyler Perry&#x27;s House of Payne&quot; in 2011, Sherman Hemsley and Marla Gibbs reprised their roles of George Jefferson and Florence Johnston.

In 1985, Hemsley and Sanford (who was older than her TV husband by 21 years) made a special joint guest appearance in the Canale 5 comedy show &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;, starring the Italian actors Paolo Villaggio, the comic duo Franco &amp; Ciccio, and Carmen Russo. They were guests in the fictional hotel and their voices were dubbed by Italian actors Enzo Garinei (George) and Isa di Marzio (Louise), who also dubbed their characters for the full series. , the members still alive from the main cast include Marla Gibbs, Berlinda Tolbert, Damon Evans, and Jay Hammer.

==Series development==
Louise Jefferson, played by Isabel Sanford, first appeared in the &quot;All in the Family&quot; episode &quot;Lionel Moves Into the Neighborhood&quot;, which was broadcast on March 2, 1971. The episode, the eighth of the series, centers on Louise, her son Lionel, and her husband George moving next door to Archie and Edith Bunker in the working-class section of Queens. Lionel, played by Mike Evans, first appeared in &quot;Meet the Bunkers&quot;, the premiere episode of &quot;All in the Family&quot;.

Norman Lear created the character of George Jefferson specifically for Hemsley. Lear originally intended for George to appear in the first season of the series, but Hemsley was starring in the Broadway musical &quot;Purlie&quot; at the time, and Lear decided to postpone introduction of the character until Hemsley was available. Lear created the character of Henry Jefferson, George&#x27;s younger brother, who was portrayed by Mel Stewart which replaced George with Henry in the series&#x27;s scripts until &quot;Purlie&quot; finished its run. Henry played as George when Louise felt embarrassed that George did not want to be in Archie Bunker&#x27;s house due to prejudice. George was introduced in the episode &quot;Henry&#x27;s Farewell&quot;, and Hemsley and Stewart share their only scene together in its final minutes. The episode marked the final appearance of Henry throughout the series.

The idea of the Jeffersons &quot;moving on up&quot; came after three members of the Black Panthers who were fans of Lear&#x27;s productions visited Lear&#x27;s CBS office, raising issues with the creator over the portrayal of Black people on television, including his &quot;Maude&quot; spin-off series &quot;Good Times&quot;. &quot;Every time you see a Black man on the tube, he is dirt poor, wears shit clothes, can&#x27;t afford nothing,&quot; Lear recalled in his autobiography. Lear consulted with his associate Al Burton on the concept.

George, Louise, and Lionel continued to appear on &quot;All in the Family&quot; until 1975, when the spin-off &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, also created by Lear, premiered. The characters of Lionel&#x27;s multiracial fiancée, Jenny, and her family, all of whom first appeared in the 1974 &quot;All in the Family&quot; episode &quot;Lionel&#x27;s Engagement&quot;, were also written into the new series. However, the roles were all recast, with Berlinda Tolbert taking over the role of Jenny, veteran actor Franklin Cover playing her father, Tom Willis, whose first name was changed from Louis, as it was in their first &quot;All in the Family&quot; appearance, and Roxie Roker as her mother, Helen. Roker was asked during a casting interview if she would be comfortable with her character having a white husband. In response she showed a picture of her husband, Sy Kravitz, who was white.

==Synopsis==
During the January 11, 1975 episode of &quot;All in the Family&quot;, titled &quot;The Jeffersons Move Up&quot;, Edith Bunker gave a tearful good-bye to her neighbor Louise Jefferson as her husband George, their son Lionel, and she moved from a working-class section of Queens, New York, into the luxurious Colby East, a fictitious high-rise apartment complex on East 63rd Street in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; premiered the following week, on January 18, 1975.

George&#x27;s career as a dry-cleaner began in the first season of &quot;All in the Family&quot; in the third episode &quot;Oh, My Aching Back&quot; (though the character himself did not appear on-camera). After his car was rear-ended by a bus, he filed a civil action and won $5000, enough to open his first store in Queens. At the beginning of &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, he was operating five stores throughout New York City, with another two opening during the following seasons.

Louise made friends with Tom and Helen Willis, an interracial couple with two adult children of their own (whom George derided as &quot;zebras&quot;): son Allan (played by Andrew Rubin in the first-season finale, and by Jay Hammer throughout season 5), a white-passing college drop-out; and daughter Jenny, an aspiring fashion designer. Jenny and Lionel became a couple, married on December 24, 1976, and later became the parents of a daughter, Jessica (played by Ebonie Smith). Lionel and Jenny experienced marital issues as evidenced in a two-part season 8 episode &quot;The Separation&quot;, and divorced in the final season two-parter &quot;Sayonara&quot;.

Marla Gibbs portrayed the role of Florence Johnston, the Jeffersons&#x27; back-talking, tough, wisecracking, and devoutly religious housekeeper. Florence often teased George, mostly about his short stature and receding hairline. One episode featured George requesting Florence to insult him, in order to get to a prospective business partner who was fond of her wisecracks.

Paul Benedict arrived as Harry Bentley, an amiable, kind, loyal yet eccentric British next-door neighbor, who worked as an interpreter at the United Nations. A frequent sight-gag of the show was George slamming the door in Bentley&#x27;s face mid-conversation, usually during one of Bentley&#x27;s stories which George invariably perceived as boring. Bentley also had a bad back, and frequently needed George to walk on it. He also became known for addressing the Jeffersons as &quot;Mr. J&quot; and &quot;Mrs. J&quot;.

Zara Cully played George&#x27;s mother, Olivia &quot;Mother&quot; Jefferson, who constantly disparaged her daughter-in-law. Cully, who had first appeared in the 1974 &quot;All in the Family&quot; episode &quot;Lionel&#x27;s Engagement&quot;, reprised her role. She appeared regularly in the first two seasons, but made sporadic appearances over the next two years, much thinner due to a severe case of pneumonia. Cully was written out in season 4 due to her death in 1978, from lung cancer. No episode was centered on Mother Jefferson&#x27;s death, but it was occasionally mentioned in future episodes that she had died.

Ned Wertimer played their tip-hungry doorman, Ralph Hart, throughout the series. He was known for constantly stalling at the Jeffersons&#x27; door with his hand out waiting for a tip. Most of the cast usually didn&#x27;t respond, but George almost always gave in. He also used it in a blackmail manner, usually requiring George to pay more in order to keep his mouth shut about something such as a stock tip. Ralph was also known for making up stories of him struggling to fulfill the Jeffersons&#x27; request to get more tips.

Danny Wells played Charlie, the owner and a bartender of a nearby bar to the Jeffersons apartment building. The cast commonly visited the bar for a drink or to attend a party. Charlie was also revealed to be an alcoholic in the season 11 episode &quot;A Secret in the Back Room&quot;, in which Charlie is in denial, but the Jeffersons eventually get him to admit to his problem and advise him to get some help. His alcohol problem isn&#x27;t referenced anymore throughout the series, but it is assumable Charlie overcame it.

===Cast changes===

Mike Evans (&quot;Lionel&quot;) left the show after the first season; his replacement was Damon Evans (no relation), who took over the role until halfway through the fourth season. Damon Evans&#x27;s last episode was &quot;Lionel Gets the Business&quot;.

Mike Evans and Tolbert returned in the 1979–1980 season, with Tolbert&#x27;s character, Jenny, pregnant with a daughter named Jessica. However, Mike Evans appeared for only one more season, along with Tolbert. &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;″ sixth season peaked at No. 8 in the summer of 1980. The characters of Lionel and Jenny were written out by stating that they had marital problems, the result of which became a two-part episode storyline as the series&#x27; eighth-season premiere. The series&#x27; eighth season was the first African-American sitcom in years (since &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;) to peak in the top 5 (the series&#x27; eighth season debuted at No. 3).

Evans and Tolbert appeared in the two-part episode together; Evans made his final appearance in two episodes during the series&#x27; eleventh and final season. Tolbert became a regular guest star throughout the rest of the series. In the spring of 1981, Paul Benedict left the show for a season and a half, returning in the final two seasons of the series. However, the ratings sank below the top 30, and &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; aired its last episode, &quot;Red Robins&quot;, on July 2, 1985.

==Episodes==
&quot;The Jeffersons&quot; had many two-part episodes, either over two consecutive weeks, or aired as an hour-long episode.
==Theme song==
Ja&#x27;Net DuBois and Jeff Barry co-wrote &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; theme song, &quot;Movin&#x27; On Up&quot;, which was sung by DuBois with a gospel choir.

The song&#x27;s creation comes from DuBois asking Norman Lear if she could do something other than her short appearances as a supporting player on &quot;Good Times&quot;, such as something in music. Lear responded to that by suggesting that she create a theme song about an upcoming series about a dry cleaner. DuBois initially struggled in composing until her mother suggested that she base the lyrics on her dream of giving her mother a comfortable retirement. With that inspiration, DuBois created the song and upon hearing it, Lear was stunned that it matched &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;&#x27; premise perfectly even though he did not describe it to DuBois in detail. With the song in hand, Lear created a full arrangement for it as the theme song.

==Broadcast history and Nielsen ratings==
&quot;The Jeffersons&quot; changed time slots at least 15 different times during its 11-year run, unusual for a popular long running series. The most common time slot was on Sunday night.

In its first season (1974–75), the show ranked at number four, surpassed by its parent series &quot;All in the Family&quot; (which landed at number one for the fifth year in a row). The show&#x27;s ratings for the following two seasons placed it in the Top 30, but during the 1977–78 and 1978–79 seasons (the show&#x27;s fourth and fifth seasons), it fell out of the top 30, ranking 52nd in Season 4 and 49th in Season 5.

It returned to the Top 10 in 1979–80, and at the end of the 1981–82 season, &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; finished third overall, only surpassed by fellow CBS series &quot;Dallas&quot; and &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. The series would remain among the Top 20 for the next two seasons.

==Daytime reruns==
The series was rebroadcast on CBS from February 4, 1980, to September 25, 1981.

==Home media==
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the first six seasons of &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; on DVD in Region 1 between 2002 and 2007.

On August 27, 2013, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to various television series from the Sony Pictures library including &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;. They subsequently re-released the first two seasons on DVD on May 20, 2014.

On August 8, 2014, it was announced that Shout! Factory had acquired the rights to the series from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment; they subsequently released the complete series on DVD in a 33-disc collection on December 9, 2014.

On April 28, 2015, Shout! released season 7 on DVD in Region 1. Season 8 was released on August 11, 2015.

==Awards and nominations==
&quot;The Jeffersons&quot; received 14 Emmy Award nominations during its time on the air. Marla Gibbs was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series each year from 1981 to 1985. Sherman Hemsley was nominated for Best Actor in 1984. Larry M. Harris won the Emmy for Outstanding Video Tape Editing for a Series in 1983.

Isabel Sanford was nominated for 7 consecutive Best Actress Emmys, from 1979-85. Her win in 1981 made her the first African-American actress to win an Emmy for Best Actress in a Comedy Series, and the second to win any Emmy Award; Gail Fisher, who played Peggy on the TV show &quot;Mannix&quot;, preceded her in 1970. Sanford was also the recipient of five of the eight Golden Globe Awards nominations the program received.

===Criticism===
Gregory Kane, journalist for &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, called the series &quot;demeaning&quot; in 1999, criticizing Hemsley&#x27;s &quot;pimp roll walk&quot;, bigotry, loud mouth and low intelligence. &quot;I hereby declare &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; stereotypical fare that depicts blacks in a buffoonish manner.&quot;

==2019 special==

On May 22, 2019, ABC broadcast &quot;Live in Front of a Studio Audience: Norman Lear&#x27;s All in the Family and The Jeffersons&quot;, produced by Lear and Jimmy Kimmel and starring Woody Harrelson, Marisa Tomei, Jamie Foxx, Wanda Sykes, Ike Barinholtz, Kerry Washington, Ellie Kemper. Marla Gibbs reprised her role as Florence Johnston.

<text>In molecular biology and pharmacology, a small molecule or micromolecule is a low molecular weight (≤ 1000 daltons) organic compound that may regulate a biological process, with a size on the order of 1 nm. Many drugs are small molecules; the terms are equivalent in the literature. Larger structures such as nucleic acids and proteins, and many polysaccharides are not small molecules, although their constituent monomers (ribo- or deoxyribonucleotides, amino acids, and monosaccharides, respectively) are often considered small molecules. Small molecules may be used as research tools to probe biological function as well as leads in the development of new therapeutic agents. Some can inhibit a specific function of a protein or disrupt protein–protein interactions.

Pharmacology usually restricts the term &quot;small molecule&quot; to molecules that bind specific biological macromolecules and act as an effector, altering the activity or function of the target. Small molecules can have a variety of biological functions or applications, serving as cell signaling molecules, drugs in medicine, pesticides in farming, and in many other roles. These compounds can be natural (such as secondary metabolites) or artificial (such as antiviral drugs); they may have a beneficial effect against a disease (such as drugs) or may be detrimental (such as teratogens and carcinogens).

== Molecular weight cutoff ==
The upper molecular-weight limit for a small molecule is approximately 900 daltons, which allows for the possibility to rapidly diffuse across cell membranes so that it can reach intracellular sites of action. This molecular weight cutoff is also a necessary but insufficient condition for oral bioavailability as it allows for transcellular transport through intestinal epithelial cells. In addition to intestinal permeability, the molecule must also possess a reasonably rapid rate of dissolution into water and adequate water solubility and moderate to low first pass metabolism. A somewhat lower molecular weight cutoff of 500 daltons (as part of the &quot;rule of five&quot;) has been recommended for oral small molecule drug candidates based on the observation that clinical attrition rates are significantly reduced if the molecular weight is kept below this limit.

==Drugs==

Most pharmaceuticals are small molecules, although some drugs can be proteins (e.g., insulin and other biologic medical products). With the exception of therapeutic antibodies, many proteins are degraded if administered orally and most often cannot cross cell membranes. Small molecules are more likely to be absorbed, although some of them are only absorbed after oral administration if given as prodrugs. One advantage that small molecule drugs (SMDs) have over &quot;large molecule&quot; biologics is that many small molecules can be taken orally whereas biologics generally require injection or another parenteral administration. Small molecule drugs are also typically simpler to manufacture and cheaper for the purchaser. A downside is that not all targets are amenable to modification with small-molecule drugs; bacteria and cancers are often resistant to their effects.

== Secondary metabolites ==
A variety of organisms including bacteria, fungi, and plants, produce small molecule secondary metabolites also known as natural products, which play a role in cell signaling, pigmentation and in defense against predation. Secondary metabolites are a rich source of biologically active compounds and hence are often used as research tools and leads for drug discovery. Examples of secondary metabolites include:

* Alkaloids
* Glycosides
* Lipids
* Nonribosomal peptides, such as actinomycin-D
* Phenazines
* Natural phenols (including flavonoids)
* Polyketide
* Terpenes and terpenoids, including steroids
* Tetrapyrroles.
== Research tools ==
 Enzymes and receptors are often activated or inhibited by endogenous protein, but can be also inhibited by endogenous or exogenous small molecule inhibitors or activators, which can bind to the active site or on the allosteric site.

An example is the teratogen and carcinogen phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which is a plant terpene that activates protein kinase C, which promotes cancer, making it a useful investigative tool. There is also interest in creating small molecule artificial transcription factors to regulate gene expression, examples include wrenchnolol (a wrench shaped molecule).

Binding of ligand can be characterised using a variety of analytical techniques such as surface plasmon resonance, microscale thermophoresis or dual polarisation interferometry to quantify the reaction affinities and kinetic properties and also any induced conformational changes.

== Anti-genomic therapeutics ==
Small-molecule anti-genomic therapeutics, or SMAT, refers to a biodefense technology that targets DNA signatures found in many biological warfare agents. SMATs are new, broad-spectrum drugs that unify antibacterial, antiviral and anti-malarial activities into a single therapeutic that offers substantial cost benefits and logistic advantages for physicians and the military.

<text>The Oracle is a fictional character in &quot;The Matrix&quot; franchise. She was created by The Wachowskis, and portrayed by Gloria Foster in the first and second film and Mary Alice in the third film. The character also appears in the video game &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; and the massively multiplayer online role-playing game &quot;The Matrix Online&quot;.

==Character history==

In the first film, the Oracle is depicted as a cheerful old lady who smokes cigarettes and bakes cookies. She possesses the power of foresight, which she uses to advise and guide the humans attempting to fight the Matrix. Later, she is revealed to be a sapient program who is integral to the very nature of the Matrix itself.

The Oracle is played by Gloria Foster in &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, and by Mary Alice in &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; and &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;, one of the franchise&#x27;s video games. In reality, Mary Alice played the Oracle because Gloria Foster died of complications from diabetes before her role in &quot;Matrix Revolutions&quot; was shot. In &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; and &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;, it is explained that Kamala and Rama Kandra, the parents of Sati, traded with the Merovingian, giving the Oracle&#x27;s termination code in exchange for their daughter&#x27;s passage into the Matrix as an Exile via the Trainman.

Neo meets the Oracle in two different locations over the course of the film series. In &quot;The Matrix&quot;, he finds her in an apartment filled with various &quot;potentials&quot;—children whose ability to control their surroundings suggests that they may be The One. During &quot;Reloaded&quot;, he returns to the apartment only to find it empty, then later finds her waiting for him in a paved courtyard between city buildings. She has with her a purse filled with candies that resemble the red pill Neo took to free himself from the Matrix. In &quot;Revolutions&quot;, the two meet in the kitchen of the apartment, sometime after Morpheus and Trinity seek her advice in the living room.

In the first film, Agent Smith revealed that the first Matrix was a failure because it was too perfect for humans to accept. This has been revealed in &quot;The Matrix Online&quot; continuity as the &quot;Paradise&quot; version of the Matrix. The Architect confirms this (and his own responsibility for its creation) in the second film, adding that he also created a second failed Matrix based on human history and nature (as he perceived it without the Oracle), which has come to be known as the &quot;Nightmare&quot; version of the Matrix. By including the Oracle, whose investigations into the human psyche yielded the answer to creating a functional simulation that humans would accept, a stable System was created with the third version of the Matrix, while the Prophecy of the One made to ensure its continuity in cycles.

In &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, the Oracle succeeds in unbalancing the Matrix (seeing the simultaneous rise of both Neo and Smith) to the extent that it is almost destroyed. In doing so, she manages to bring about a resolution in which the machines and the humans can coexist in peace. The Architect tells her she &quot;played a very dangerous game&quot; helping the humans (or, more accurately, creating Smith with the ability to duplicate himself without limit, like a cancer, both inside the Matrix and within the larger machine world and creating Neo—the only thing with the potential to contain Smith), to which she replies that &quot;change always is [dangerous]&quot;. The Architect also promises to the Oracle that the humans desiring to be free from the Matrix will gain their freedom as part of the peacemaking between the humans and the machines. When asked whether Neo will return, she says she suspects that they will see him again, indicating that he may still be alive, that he may be reincarnated, or most probably, that Neo is part human and part software and the software part of Neo continues on.

In between the events of &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;, the Oracle is one of many programs who is purged by the Machines before the new Matrix is uploaded. Niobe later tells a resurrected Neo that the last message that they received from her was that a new power was rising. Despite this, the Oracle still appears in &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot; in the form of flashbacks.

==Character analysis==

Whether the Oracle&#x27;s power of prediction is deterministic or not is a concept given much treatment in all three films. She herself claims that she lacks the ability to see past her own choice, explaining that no one, including herself, can see past a choice they do not understand. It becomes clear in the films that her power cannot be used to predict the ultimate consequences of Neo, who possesses free will when he defies the Architect.

Her power of foresight, on the other hand, is probably not a foresight based on knowledge of a pre-determined future, but rather a calculation; The Architect revealed the Oracle to be &quot;a program designed to investigate the human psyche&quot;; thus, allowing the Matrix to become more accustomed for the majority of the human population to accept. She exhibits a trait for predicting events directly relevant to the nature and/or programming of the Matrix, and natural human responses according to her knowledge of them; this is most clear in her prediction of Neo&#x27;s choice between Morpheus&#x27; life and his own. While the Oracle knew that the Agents would be searching for Morpheus as he was searching for &#x27;the One&#x27;, and seeing Cypher&#x27;s actions and reactions (such as his conversation with Agent Smith), she predicted the most likely event. Another example is her prediction about Neo&#x27;s choice in the second movie, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;; she had existed throughout five versions, and regardless of the One&#x27;s ability to exhibit free will, she had experienced a series of events that had and would occur and push the One to the Source.

In &quot;Revolutions&quot;, the Oracle hints at her true purpose, which is to bring imbalance to the equations that form the Matrix. In this purpose she is opposed to her counterpart, the Architect, whose goal is to balance those same equations.

As the Architect explains in &quot;Reloaded&quot;, he and the Oracle have very different roles to play in maintaining the stability of the Matrix. The Oracle spreads a prophecy of The One&#x27;s final victory over the machines, and those humans who choose to follow this belief are allowed to disconnect from the system voluntarily. They create the real-world settlement of Zion; when its population grows large enough to become a threat to the Matrix&#x27;s stability, the Architect takes action. He launches a machine offensive campaign to destroy Zion and reunite The One with the Source, rebooting the Matrix and keeping control over the humans for one more cycle. When Neo and the Architect meet, this cycle is about to complete its sixth repetition.

This Yin-Yang relationship is a form of balance between opposing forces, so it becomes obvious that the Architect and the Oracle are the two balancing forces of the Matrix itself: the fallible human factor and the logic of the machines. This idea is even hinted in the films as the Oracle is wearing yin-yang earrings throughout the third film. This process of balance between opposing forces is even more realized in the conflict between Smith and Neo at the end of the third &quot;Matrix&quot; movie, wherein they annihilate one another, suggesting a collision between matter and anti-matter.

The Oracle is discussed by sociologist Matthew Hughey as an example of the Magical Negro stock character. He writes that the Matrix is mostly presented as a &quot;clean and bright&quot; city full of white people, but when Neo is brought to the Oracle, who sets him on his path to becoming a hero, she is shown to be chain-smoking and baking cookies—which marks her as a stereotypical &quot;welfare queen&quot;. According to Tani Dianca Sanchez, the personification of the Oracle by a black woman, who is robbed of her essence and existence by Agent Smith yet ultimately survives his destruction, is a rare reference in mainstream media to womanist theories of black women as liberators and saviors through their own suffering. Sanchez writes that while the Oracle embodies aspects of the black mammy stereotype in caring for white children, she ultimately represents &quot;a radical transformation of Western denigration of black women&quot; by acting as an othermother and teacher who challenges Western ideals of feminine beauty and wisdom; by suggesting a connection between the ancient Greek oracles and black cultures, the character also undermines traditional assumptions that white, Western culture developed independently of other cultures and races. Nicola Rehling writes that in opposition to the Architect&#x27;s espousal of fate and inevitability, the Oracle introduces choice into the Matrix and &quot;complicates the association of cyberspace with normative white masculinity&quot; through her nature as a sentient computer program.

<text>Graeme Lloyd Murphy AO (born 2 November 1950) is an Australian dancer and choreographer. With his fellow dancer (and wife since 2004) Janet Vernon, he guided Sydney Dance Company to become one of Australia&#x27;s most successful and best-known dance companies.

==Biography==
Murphy was born in Melbourne, and grew up in Tasmania, where he took dance classes with Sir Kenneth Gillespie in Launceston. He began his career as a student at the Australian Ballet School at the age of fourteen. In 1968 he became a dancer with The Australian Ballet where he had opportunities to choreograph. He toured America with the Australian Ballet in 1970–1971 and created his first ballet, &quot;Ecco le Diavole&quot; (Ecco). Ecco was presented at Melbourne&#x27;s Princess Theatre in July 1971. The piece was set to music by Nino Rota and featured dancers Roslyn Anderson, Roma Egan, Janet Vernon, and Wendy Walker.

Later, Murphy danced with the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Royal Ballet (now Birmingham Royal Ballet), and Les Ballets Félix Blaska in France. In 1975 he worked as a freelance choreographer. He rejoined The Australian Ballet in the early months of 1976 as both a dancer and as a resident choreographer. He was appointed as artistic director of the Dance Company of New South Wales in November 1976, renamed as Sydney Dance Company in 1979.

Murphy has been compared to the dancer and choreographer Jerome Robbins on account of the way he and his company marketed dance to a wider audience, bringing contemporary dance into a more commercial arena. Aside from his work in ballet, Murphy has also completed choreography for Torvill and Dean.

On 18 December 2004, after almost 40 years together as artistic and life partners, he and Janet Vernon married on their rural property outside Launceston.

In 2016 and 2017, Martin Portus (former Director of Marketing and Communication at the Australia Council for the Arts) conducted a number of interviews with Australian choreographers including Graeme Murphy. In the interview, Murphy discusses the highlights of various aspects of his career as a dancer and choreographer: his teenage training at The Australian Ballet School and early work as a classical dancer with the Australian Ballet; his developing interest in choreography and contemporary dance in the early 1970s; the beginnings of his lifelong creative partnership with Janet Vernon; the formation of the Sydney Dance Company and his appointment as artistic director in 1976; his signature productions involving theatrical spectacle, powerful storytelling, collaboration with Australian composers, and innovative set and costume designs; his constant touring overseas and work with Australian ballet; the financial disasters which prompted him to leave the Sydney Dance Company after 31 years; his work and aspirations.

==Honours==
On 26 January 1988, Murphy was named a member of the Order of Australia for &quot;his service to ballet.&quot; On 1 January 2001, he was awarded the Centenary Medal for &quot;service to the development of dance in Australia and Tasmania&quot;. On 11 June 2012, Murphy was named an Officer of the Order of Australia for &quot;distinguished service to the performing arts, both nationally and internationally, particularly ballet and contemporary dance, as a choreographer and director, and to the enhancement of Australia&#x27;s cultural environment.&quot;

===Helpmann Awards===
The Helpmann Awards is an awards show, celebrating live entertainment and performing arts in Australia, presented by industry group &quot;Live Performance Australia&quot; (LPA) since 2001. In 2002, Murphy received the JC Williamson Award, the LPA&#x27;s highest honour, for their life&#x27;s work in live performance.

<text>Pomors or Pomory (, ) are an ethnographic group thought to be descended from Russian settlers (primarily from Veliky Novgorod) according to traditional Russian historiography, living on the White Sea coasts and the territory whose southern border lies on a watershed which separates the White Sea river basin from the basins of rivers that flow south. Genetically, though, they are more closely related to indigenous Uralic ethnicities of the area and show no affiliations to Novgorod populations.

==History==
As early as the 12th century, explorers from Novgorod entered the White Sea through the Northern Dvina, Mezen, Pechora and Onega estuaries and founded settlements along the sea coasts of Bjarmaland. Kholmogory served as their chief town until the rise of Arkhangelsk in the late 16th century. From their base at Kola, they explored the Barents Region and the Kola peninsula and Novaya Zemlya.

Later the Pomors discovered and maintained the Northern Sea Route between Arkhangelsk and Siberia. With their ships (&quot;koches&quot;), the Pomors penetrated to the trans-Ural areas of Northern Siberia, where they founded the settlement of Mangazeya east of the Yamal Peninsula in the early 16th century. Tatyana Bratkova has reported that some historians speculate that in the early 17th century, Pomors settled the isolated village of Russkoye Ustye in the delta of the Indigirka, in north-eastern Yakutia.

The name of the Pomors derives from the &quot;Pomorsky&quot; (literally, &quot;maritime&quot;) coast of the White Sea (between Onega and Kem), having the root of &quot;more&quot; (, meaning &quot;sea&quot;; derived from an Indo-European root). The same root appears in the toponym Pomerania (Polish: &quot;Pomorze&quot;) and Armorica (Gaulish: ) and also in the Gaulish ethnonym Morini.

The term &quot;Pomor,&quot; which in the 10th–12th centuries meant &quot;a person who lived near sea&quot;, gradually was extended into one to apply to this population living relatively far away from the sea. Finally in the 15th century, the people became disconnected from the sea. The sea was not a major part of economy of this region. At the same time, people began using the term Pomor&#x27;e to refer to a territory of practically the whole European Russian North, including the Murmansk, Arkhangelsk and Vologda regions; and Karelia and Komi republics.

The traditional livelihoods of the Pomor based on the sea included animal hunting, whaling and fishing; in tundra regions they practiced reindeer herding. The Pomor traded by sea in corn and fish with Northern Norway, which became important to both sides. This trade was so intensive that a kind of Russian-Norwegian pidgin language &quot;Moja på tvoja&quot; (or Russenorsk) developed on the North Norwegian coast that was used from 1750 to 1920.

In the 12–15th centuries, Pomor&#x27;e was considered an extensive colony of the state of Veliky Novgorod. By the early 16th century the annexation of Pomor&#x27;e by Moscow was completed. In the 17th century, in 22 Pomor&#x27;e districts, the great bulk of the population consisted of free peasants. A portion of the land belonged to monasteries and to the Stroganov merchants. There were no landlords in Pomor&#x27;e. The population of Pomor&#x27;e districts was engaged in fishing, mica and salt production (Sol&#x27;-Kamskay, Sol&#x27;- Vychegodskay, Tot&#x27;ma, etc.) and other enterprises. 

The Russian &quot;Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary,&quot; in its 1890–1907 edition, classified Pomors as Great Russians or referred to them as Russian traders and trappers of the North. To date, no encyclopedia or encyclopedic dictionary refers to the Pomor as a separate ethnic group.

In the 2002 census, respondents had the option to identify as &quot;Pomors&quot;, this group being tabulated by the census as a subgroup of the Russian ethnicity. However, only 6,571 persons did so, almost all of them in Arkhangelsk Oblast (6,295) and Murmansk Oblast (127).

==Religion &amp; society==
Pomors are mostly Orthodox Christians in faith. Prior to the Revolution of 1917 a large percentage of Russians from Pomorje (or Pomors) were practicing Old Believers, the Pomorian Church still has around 400 thousand members. Pomor Christianity has traditionally coexisted and been infused with an animism, which is based on sacral geography, in a syncretic manner, resulting in a strong environmental ethic. This led to the classification of certain animals like the beluga whale as holy and resistance to modern fishing techniques in the 20th century.

=== Pomor worldview ===
As part of the broader category of &quot;cold societies&quot; that are based around the concept of eternal return like the neighboring Sami, Nenets or Komi the Pomor worldview reflects a complex interaction between ancient piety, shamanism, and ritualistic practices aimed at maintaining homeostasis within their communities. This homeostasis however, is an active and fluid concept called dynamic constancy and does not represent absolute standstill. The Pomors believed that preserving the static structure of their society was essential for survival in the environment of Pomorye, where the poet-storyteller (starinshchik) as a keeper of &quot;deified memory&quot; played a key role in maintaining this balance through mythopoetic expression. 

The passage from winter to summer was culturally connected to rebirth and rituals like making a sacrificial vow to the &quot;sea god&quot; Nikola Morsky and celebrating the farewell to sea like a funeral played a key role in the light of these philosophical elements. During the main holiday, the conjunction of Old and New Year, the demiurge defeats the bearer of chaos and death each year anew, emphasizing the concept of cyclical time and eternal return. The total sacrifice and descend into chaos which leads to the poiesis of a new world is all-encompassing and does not only apply to people, but also gods and beasts. 

These spiritual beliefs also played a large role in daily life, as it is a part of the &quot;Pomor fate&quot; to actively engage in this battle, which is not only shaped by actions but also the words of the shaman or starinshchik, the person who has knowledge of the ritual turns of speech and sacred formulas. The winter is considered a dreamtime, which is ended by localized celebrations of symbolic rebirth that greet the sun, which plays a key role in Pomor mythology as it is also represented by the Bird of Happiness in Pomor households.

One of the critical aspects of the Pomor spiritual world was the sacred status of the bathhouse, which was viewed as an archaic sanctuary-temple. The bathhouse played a central role in initiatory and medical rituals that symbolized the &quot;second birth&quot; of a person, just like the festivals connected to the sun. The connection between the bathhouse and the forge is notable, as both were considered marginal spaces associated with transformation and rebirth, drawing from their symbolic links to fire and water. The sacred geography of the Pomors placed the bathhouse on the periphery of the settlement, reinforcing its chthonic associations with both life and death.

The sea, central to Pomor life, held a significant mythopoetic meaning as a threshold between the world of the living and the world of the dead. This view of the sea as a boundary endowed navigation with profound religious significance. The Pomors regarded the northeast wind, or &quot;polunoshnik,&quot; as a sacred force, connecting the mundane world to the mystical realms of the North, where contact with the otherworldly was inevitable. The sea, with its destructive and creative powers, was perceived as both a source of chaos and a pathway to salvation, reflecting the dual nature of the northern lands adjacent to the Polar Mountain, which were simultaneously regions of heaven and hell. 

As the last two elements show, the combination of destruction and creation, life and death, or even the sacred and the mundane at the same time instead of a clear cut separation of dual forces like good and evil, is pivotal to Pomor philosophy, reminiscent of concepts like Yin and Yang. This highlights the importance of liminal spaces and thresholds. Even the sacred always has a dark side which is in this case represented by the &quot;guardians of the threshold&quot; while the &quot;axis of the world&quot; or &quot;northern mountain&quot; which was believed to exist behind the sea was recognized as a paradise. However, it is not possible to enter the realm of the sacred without experiencing its ambivalence and dark aspects, represented by the guardians. Elements like the &quot;wind rose&quot;, which helped Pomor sailors navigate, were also considered to be sacred knowledge.

The concept of islands also held a sacred significance in Pomor rituals, particularly in burial and memorial practices. Islands were seen as chthonic spaces that connected the living with the ancestors, ensuring the stability of the ethnic group’s sacred traditions. In Pomor belief, these island-topos served as symbolic models of the universe, where the three co-temporal and co-spatial domains of the dead, the living, and the descendants intersected, creating a space where the past, present, and future were fused into a single continuum. Ritual remembrance, particularly through the act of memorial rites conducted on these islands, reinforced the eternal memory of the ancestors and the sacred geometry of the cosmos, thereby preserving the cultural identity of the Pomors.

These traditions live on in modern Pomor society where a syncretic belief is widespread next to a number of (new) religious movements, that are based on traditional Pomor worldviews, which emerged after the fall of the atheist Soviet Union. Modern Pomor people have a free, fluid and diverse conception of religion and may celebrate traditional holidays like the Pomor New Year in September or the Roe Deer Festival, partake in Orthodox pilgrimages or meditate in places of power where they may also leave ribbons and coins. These traditions are however often combined into a single syncretic worldview with a topographical basis that includes local locus cults and hierotopic practices without clear boundaries between the sacred and the profane. Affiliation with the Russian Orthodox Church is low.

=== Gender identity ===
In Pomorye traditionally exists the social role of &quot;raspetushya&quot;, persons of indeterminate sex, who can be either born intersex or a biological male with appearance, behavior, lifestyle and occupations that are closer to a woman. According to society, these people did not have a certain gender and therefore had to wander around the villages. However, they were also seen as people with magical knowledge and secret skills like healing. While never being able to be a full part of society outside of intermediate positions, they were able to have social contacts and could for example sing together with the women. Nowadays, the LGBT community of the region embraces the identity instead of the term &quot;third gender&quot; which is seen as a Western or European construct.

=== Pomor fairy tales ===
The culture of neighboring peoples had a significant influence on the fairy tale (bylina) tradition of Pomorye. The most popular ones here are long fairy tales about adventures, in which the action is often connected with the sea. Usually the main character of such tales is a poor man. Fairy tales with a female protagonist are no less common. They share all the trials equally with the men or turn out to be his wonderful assistant. Though, in a number of tales, girls are also innocent victims of a treacherous enemy.

==Current situation==

Nowadays the Pomors are a minority in Arkhangelsk Oblast where most people are descendants of non-native Russians but there is still a thriving cultural scene with international outreach. However, the Pomor villages are not protected by the state which has taken the right to fish and hunt animals away from the Pomors, banned the traditional Pomor trade of Greenland seals and expropriates their lands to then auction them to foreign investors, turning traditional houses to firewood and banning the people from entering their ancestral grounds. Russian laws target the indigenous population and even if promised the Pomors do not receive any compensation. This has led to the depopulation of vast areas that are now used for military purposes. By 2012, 50% of all Pomor villages had been destroyed, dubbed a genocide by P. Esipov, the first leader of the Pomor national-cultural autonomy as registered by the Russian Ministry of Justice. Many Pomor villages are only reachable by helicopter and have lacking infrastructure, large parts of Pomorye are now used as garbage dumps. This led to the 2018–2020 Shies protests under the motto “Pomorye is not a trash heap” with more than 30,000 participants that successfully blocked the creation of a landfill at Shiyes station and led to the resignation of Governor of Arkhangelsk Oblast Igor Orlov and Komi Republic Governor Sergei Gaplikov. The movement was influenced by Pomor separatists that seek an independent Pomorye or Biarmia
One of the three universities of Arkhangelsk was named the Pomor State University (now merged into Northern (Arctic) Federal University).
In line with the current Russian trend towards amalgamating the least populated federal subjects into larger entities, a merger of Arkhangelsk and Murmansk Oblasts, the Komi Republic, and the Nenets Autonomous Okrug has been proposed, one of the possible names of this new territory being the Pomor Krai.

<text>HMAS &quot;Ladava&quot; (P 92) was an of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). It was named after the small village of Ladava situated on the shore of Milne Bay in Alotau District, Papua New Guinea. Completed in 1968, the vessel was one of five assigned to the RAN&#x27;s Papua New Guinea (PNG) Division. The patrol boat was transferred to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force in 1974 as HMPNGS &quot;Ladava&quot;. The patrol boat was decommissioned in 1988, although her fate is unknown.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Attack&quot; class was ordered in 1964 to operate in Australian waters as patrol boats (based on lessons learned through using the s on patrols of Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, and to replace a variety of old patrol, search-and-rescue, and general-purpose craft. Initially, fourteen were ordered for the RAN, five of which were intended for the Papua New Guinea Division of the RAN, although another six ships were ordered to bring the class to twenty vessels.

The patrol boats had a displacement of 100 tons at standard load and 146 tons at full load, were in length overall, had a beam of , and draughts of at standard load, and at full load. Propulsion machinery consisted of two 16-cylinder Paxman YJCM diesel engines, which supplied to the two propellers. The vessels could achieve a top speed of , and had a range of at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of three officers and sixteen sailors. Main armament was a bow-mounted Bofors 40 mm gun, supplemented by two .50-calibre M2 Browning machine guns and various small arms. The ships were designed with as many commercial components as possible: the &quot;Attack&quot;s were to operate in remote regions of Australia and New Guinea, and a town&#x27;s hardware store would be more accessible than home base in a mechanical emergency.

&quot;Ladava&quot; was built by Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland, launched on 11 May 1968, and commissioned on 21 October 1968.

==Operational history==
HMAS &quot;Ladava&quot; arrived at the RAN base at Los Negros Island, Manus Province in December 1968, joining the previously delivered &quot;Aitape&quot;, &quot;Samarai&quot;, and &quot;Lae&quot;. Primary roles of the new patrol boats were fisheries protection and sea training, but also undertook search and rescue, medical evacuation and monitoring of navigational aids roles. The ship&#x27;s company was made up of both Australian and PNG servicemen. Prior to the arrival of the &quot;Attack&quot;-class patrol boats, surveillance of PNG waters was conducted by small coastal craft and occasional visits by larger RAN warships, but the PNG Division was now able to chase and apprehend vessels suspected of illegal fishing.

In February 1968, &quot;Ladava&quot; and sister ship &quot;Aitape&quot; traveled up the Sepik River in western Papua New Guinea. In a first for the PNG Division, HMAS &quot;Ladava&quot; became the first patrol boat to be completely PNG-manned on 18 June 1974, when Lieutenant Karry Frank took command.

&quot;Ladava&quot; was one of the five &quot;Attack&quot;-class patrol boats of the RAN PNG Division transferred to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force&#x27;s (PNGDF) Maritime Element (now Maritime Operations Element) on 14 November 1974 when the PNGDF took over maritime functions from the RAN. They formed the PNGDF Patrol Boat Squadron based at Manus. &quot;Ladava&quot; was decommissioned in 1988.

<text>Discover is an American general audience science magazine launched in October 1980 by Time Inc. It is currently owned by LabX Media Group.

==History==

===Founding===
&quot;Discover&quot; was created primarily through the efforts of &quot;Time&quot; magazine editor Leon Jaroff. He noticed that magazine sales jumped every time the cover featured a science topic. Jaroff interpreted this as a considerable public interest in science, and in 1971, he began agitating for the creation of a science-oriented magazine. This was difficult, as a former colleague noted, because &quot;Selling science to people who graduated to be managers was very difficult&quot;.

Jaroff&#x27;s persistence finally paid off, and &quot;Discover&quot; magazine published its first edition in 1980. &quot;Discover&quot; was originally launched into a burgeoning market for science magazines aimed at educated non-professionals, intended to be easier to read than &quot;Scientific American&quot; but more detailed and science-oriented than &quot;Popular Science&quot;. Shortly after its launch, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) launched a similar magazine called &quot;Science 80&quot; (not to be confused with its flagship academic journal, &quot;Science&quot;), and both &quot;Science News&quot; and &quot;Science Digest&quot; changed their formats to follow the new trend.

During this period, &quot;Discover&quot; featured fairly in-depth science reporting on &quot;hard science&quot; and avoided fringe topics like extraterrestrial intelligence. Most issues contained essays by well-known scientists—such as Stephen Jay Gould, Jared Diamond, and Stephen Hawking. Another common article was a biography, often linked with mentions of other scientists working in the field. The &quot;Skeptical Eye&quot; column sought to uncover pop-science scams, and was the medium where James Randi released the results of Project Alpha. Jaroff said that it was the most-read section at its launch.

===Competition and change===

The sudden appearance of so many magazines in the same market space inevitably led to some falling by the wayside, and &quot;Discover&quot; was left largely alone in its market space by the mid-1980s; it nevertheless decided to appeal to a wider audience by including articles on psychology and psychiatry. Jaroff told the editor-in-chief that these were not &quot;solid sciences&quot;, and was sent back to &quot;Discover&quot;&#x27;s parent, Time, Inc. &quot;Skeptical Eye&quot; and other columns disappeared, and articles covered more controversial, speculative topics (like &quot;How the Universe Will End&quot;). The new format was a great success, and the new format remained largely unchanged for the next two decades.

Gilbert Rogin, a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; editor, was brought in 1985 to revive &quot;Discover&quot;. In 1986, Time purchased the subscription lists of the shuttered magazines &quot;Science Digest&quot; and &quot;Science 86&quot; from their publishers. Circulation for the magazine reached 925,000 by May 1987 with revenue for 1986 being $6.9 million, but annual net loss was $10 million.

In January 1987, Time appointed a new &quot;Discover&quot; publisher, Bruce A. Barnet, previously publisher of &quot;Picture Week&quot; test magazine from August 1985 to replace James B. Hayes, who was appointed publisher of &quot;Fortune&quot;.

The magazine changed hands several times. In 1987, Time, Inc. sold &quot;Discover&quot; to Family Media, the owners of &quot;Health&quot;, &quot;Golf Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Homeowner&quot;, &quot;1,001 Home Ideas&quot; and &quot;World Tennis&quot;, for $26 million. From January to July 1991, Discover magazine lost 15% of its advertising while still remaining profitable. Family Media closed down while suspending publication of all its magazines and placing them up for sale. Family Media&#x27;s last &quot;Discover&quot; issue was August 1991, with a circulation of 1.1 million copies.

In September 1991, The Walt Disney Company bought the magazine for its Disney Publishing&#x27;s Magazine Group. The magazine&#x27;s main office was moved to the Magazine Group office in Burbank while leaving one third behind in New York in a small editorial and advertising office. Disney was able to retain Family Media&#x27;s editor-in-chief for the magazine, Paul Hoffman. Disney doubled the magazine&#x27;s photography and its content budget to overcome skipping two issues in Family Media&#x27;s shutdown and ownership change. In 1993, Disney Magazine Publishing Inc. decided to launch a trade advertising campaign designed with advertising firm Ziff Marketing to raise awareness in the advertising field that the magazine is an accessible general interest magazine in the science category.

In October 2005, Bob Guccione, Jr., founder of &quot;Spin&quot; and &quot;Gear&quot; magazines, and some private equity partners purchased the magazine from Disney. Guccione was CEO and oversaw a redesign for the April 2006 issue. However, Guccione was ousted as CEO in October 2007 in what was described as &quot;a falling-out over philosophical differences with his financial backers&quot;. Henry Donahue, Discover Media&#x27;s chief financial officer, became the new CEO. In 2008, he also assumed the role of publisher. In October 2008, Corey Powell, &quot;Discover&quot;&#x27;s executive editor, became editor-in-chief. the magazine published combined issues in January/February and July/August, for a total of ten issues a year.

In 2010 the magazine was sold to Kalmbach Publishing, whose books and magazines are generally about craft and hobby subjects such as modeling (&quot;Model Railroader&quot;, &quot;FineScale Modeler&quot;, &quot;Scale Auto&quot;, &quot;Classic Toy Trains&quot;, &quot;Garden Railways&quot;, &quot;Model Retailer&quot;), beadwork (&quot;BeadStyle&quot;, &quot;Bead&amp;Button&quot;, &quot;Art Jewelry&quot;), and the outdoors (&quot;Birder&#x27;s World&quot;, &quot;Cabin Life&quot;, &quot;American Snowmobiler&quot;). It has one other science magazine, &quot;Astronomy&quot;. In August 2012 Kalmbach announced that &quot;Discover&quot; would be moving from New York City to Kalmbach&#x27;s headquarters in Wisconsin in January 2013. In December 2012, Stephen C. George became the editor-in-chief. Becky Lang was the editor-in-chief until mid-2020.

On May 1, 2024, Kalmbach Media announced the sale of most of its titles to Firecrown Media, as well as its Kalmbach Books division and related e-commerce sites, leaving &quot;Discover&quot; magazine as its sole remaining publication. and on November 8, 2024, LabX Media Group acquired &quot;Discover&quot; from Kalmbach. 

==Blog portal==
The &quot;Discover&quot; website includes a collection of blogs related to science, including Cosmic Variance, Carl Zimmer&#x27;s The Loom, and Melissa Lafsky&#x27;s Reality Base.

==TV series==
From 1983–1990, PBS aired &quot;&quot;, a monthly hour-long news magazine featuring topics from the publication and hosted by Peter Graves.

<text>Alexandra Elizabeth Sheedy (born June 13, 1962) is an American actress. She made her feature film debut in &quot;Bad Boys&quot; (1983) and came to prominence as a member of the Brat Pack with roles in &quot;Oxford Blues&quot; (1984), &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; (1985), &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; (1985), and &quot;Blue City&quot; (1986). She received three Saturn Award nominations for Best Actress for her performances in &quot;WarGames&quot; (1983), &quot;Fear&quot; (1990), and &quot;Man&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; (1993). For playing a drug-addicted lesbian photographer in &quot;High Art&quot; (1998), Sheedy won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead. She also starred in the films &quot;Twice in a Lifetime&quot; (1985), &quot;Short Circuit&quot; (1986), &quot;Betsy&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1990), &quot;Only the Lonely&quot; (1991), and &quot;Life During Wartime&quot; (2009), as well as the series &quot;Single Drunk Female&quot; (2022–2023).

==Early life==
Alexandra Elizabeth Sheedy was born in New York City on June 13, 1962, and has a brother and a sister. Her mother, Charlotte (&quot;née&quot; Baum), is a writer and press agent who was involved in women&#x27;s and civil rights movements, and her father, John J. Sheedy Jr., is a Manhattan advertising executive. Sheedy&#x27;s mother is Ashkenazi Jewish, and her father is of Irish Catholic background. Her maternal grandmother was from Odessa, Ukraine. Her parents divorced in 1971.

She attended the Bank Street School for Children, followed by Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory School in New York City, graduating in 1980. She started dancing with the American Ballet Theatre at age six and was planning to make it a full-time career. She gave up dance in favor of acting full time, however, and then started studying with acting teacher Harold Guskin. At age 12 she wrote a book, &quot;She Was Nice to Mice&quot;, which was published by McGraw-Hill Education and became a best-seller. The story was released in 1976 as a spoken word album on the Caedmon label (TC 1506). On June 19, 1975, she appeared on the game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; as herself promoting the novel which was on the adult reading list.

At age 18, Sheedy relocated to Los Angeles, California, where she enrolled in the drama department at the University of Southern California. Sheedy concurrently began her acting career and intermittently completed three years&#x27; worth of courses toward a BFA degree in acting.

==Career==

Sheedy started acting in local stage productions as a teenager. After appearing in several television films in 1981, as well as three episodes of the television series &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, she made her feature film debut in &quot;Bad Boys&quot; (1983), starring Sean Penn, wherein she played Penn&#x27;s humiliated girlfriend. During the 1980s, she became a member of the Brat Pack, and had roles in popular films such as &quot;WarGames&quot; (1983, earning her first Saturn Award nomination), &quot;Oxford Blues&quot; (1984), &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; (1985), &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; (1986), &quot;Twice in a Lifetime&quot; (1985), &quot;Blue City&quot; (1986), &quot;Short Circuit&quot; (1986), and &quot;Maid to Order&quot; (1987).

In the 1990s, Sheedy appeared in films such as &quot;Fear&quot; (1990), &quot;Betsy&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1990), &quot;Only the Lonely&quot; (1991), and &quot;Man&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; (1993). Fear and Man&#x27;s Best Friend earned her two more Saturn Award nominations for Best Actress. Sheedy starred alongside Radha Mitchell in the 1998 independent film &quot;High Art&quot;, about a romance between two women and the power of art. Her performance in &quot;High Art&quot; was recognized with awards from the Independent Spirit Awards, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, and National Society of Film Critics.

In 1999, Sheedy took over the lead role in the off-Broadway production of the musical &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch.&quot; She was the first cis-gender female to play the part of the genderqueer Hedwig, but her run ended early amid &quot;mixed&quot; reviews. That same year, she was cast as a lead actress in &quot;Sugar Town&quot;, an independent film that featured an ensemble cast of actors and musicians.

She was reunited with &quot;Breakfast Club&quot; co-star Anthony Michael Hall when she became a special guest star on his television show &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;, in the second-season episode &quot;Playing God&quot;, from 2003.

Sheedy has also appeared in the 2007 episode &quot;Leapin&#x27; Lizards&quot; of &quot;&quot;, in which she played a woman who murdered her boyfriend&#x27;s wife while mixed up in a cult. On March 3, 2008, Sheedy was introduced as the character Sarah in the ABC Family show &quot;Kyle XY&quot;. In 2009, she played the role of Mr. Yang on the USA Network television show &quot;Psych&quot; (in the third-season finale), a role that she reprised in the fourth season, fifth season, and finales.

As of 2021, Sheedy has been a professor in the theater department at the City College of New York of the City University of New York in the Hamilton Heights section of New York City. From 2022 to 2023, she played the role of Carol in the Freeform series &quot;Single Drunk Female&quot;. She was on an episode of GMA3: What You Need to Know on WABC-TV on May 10, 2023.

==Personal life==

Sheedy became a vegetarian at the age of 12.

Sheedy dated Richie Sambora, Bon Jovi&#x27;s guitarist, for less than a year in the 1980s. She stated in &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that the relationship led her to abuse drugs, a claim Sambora denied. In 1985, Sheedy was admitted to Hazelden Foundation and in the 1990s was treated for a sleeping pill addiction, an experience she drew on for her role as a drug-addicted photographer in &quot;High Art&quot;.

On April 12, 1992, Sheedy married actor David Lansbury, the nephew of actress Angela Lansbury and son of Edgar Lansbury. They had a transgender son, Beckett, from whose transition Sheedy says she &quot;learned a lot&quot;. In 2008, Sheedy announced that she and Lansbury had filed for divorce.

In January 2018, Sheedy tweeted the #MeToo hashtag along with the names of James Franco and Christian Slater, implying that they have been sexually abusive to her, but later deleted the tweets. Franco later stated that he did not know why Sheedy tweeted the accusations.

<text>Sydney Dance Company is a contemporary dance company in Australia. They have performed at the Sydney Opera House in Australia, the Joyce Theater in New York, the Shanghai Grand Theatre in China, and the Stanislavsky Theatre in Moscow. 

== History ==
Sydney Dance Company was founded in 1969 as the dance-in-education group &quot;Ballet in a Nutshell&quot; by Suzanne Musitz (Davidson), later changing its name to &quot;Athletes and Dancers&quot;, and &quot;Dance Company (NSW)&quot;. 

From 1975 to 1976, the company was led by Dutch choreographer Jaap Flier and later by Australian choreographer Graeme Murphy in 1976. In 1979, Graeme Murphy and his wife, Janet Vernon, also a dancer, renamed the company as Sydney Dance Company and served as artistic directors for three decades. During their tenure, the company became the first Western contemporary dance company to perform in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Company productions have incorporated works from notable musicians. The production &quot;Some Rooms&quot; (1983) featured a selection of existing music by composers such as Keith Jarrett, Francis Poulenc, Benjamin Britten, and Samuel Barber. &quot;Hate&quot; (1982) featured a score by the Australian composer Carl Vine, and the 1985 production &quot;Boxes&quot; included original music by composer and musician Iva Davies.

In May 2007, the company announced that Tanja Liedtke as its new artistic director; however on 17 August of that year Liedtke was killed in a traffic accident in the northern suburbs of Sydney.

In December 2007, Executive Director Noel Staunton launched the company&#x27;s 2008 season, announcing three guest choreographers, Meryl Tankard, Rafael Bonachela and Aszure Barton, to create new works for the company. Bonachela was subsequently appointed the Company&#x27;s new Artistic Director.

In December 2008, Foxtel signed a three-year sponsorship of the company involving special broadcasts and incorporating the company into subscription television programs &quot;Australia&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; and &quot;Project Runway Australia&quot;.

In 2009, Anne Dunn was appointed Executive Director of the Company.

Rafael Bonachela has been the artistic director of the company since 2009. His first commissioned work for the company, &quot;360°&quot;, was as a guest choreographer. His works &quot;include unfold&quot; (2009), &quot;6 Breaths&quot; (2010), &quot;LANDforms&quot; (2011) and &quot;2 One Another&quot; (2012), &quot;Irony of Fate&quot;, &quot;Soledad&quot;, and &quot;The Land of Yes &amp; The Land of No.&quot; He has worked with guest choreographers Kenneth Kvarnstrom (&quot;Mercury&quot; 2009), Adam Linder (&quot;Are We That We Are&quot; 2010), Emanuel Gat (&quot;Satisfying Musical Moments&quot; 2010), and Jacopo Godani (&quot;Raw Models&quot; 2011). Other guest choreographers include Alexander Ekman and Gideon Obarzanek, as well as collaborations with the Australian Chamber Orchestra and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and with composers 48nord and Ezio Bosso.

In 2014, the company announced it was granted permission to perform William Forsythe&#x27;s 1993 work &quot;Quintett&quot;. The work is set to Gavin Bryars&#x27; &quot;Jesus&#x27; Blood Never Failed Me Yet&quot;.

== Notable alumni ==
* Gideon Obarzanek, founder and former artistic director of Melbourne dance company Chunky Move
* Paul Mercurio who has gone on to make several movies including Strictly Ballroom which was directed by Baz Luhrmann.

<text>Triangle Fraternity is an American collegiate fraternity for male students majoring in engineering, architecture, and the physical, mathematical, biological, and computer sciences.

Triangle Fraternity organized at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in the fall of 1906 and was incorporated by the state of Illinois on 15 April 1907, which is celebrated each year as Founders&#x27; Day.

As of February 2020 there are 39 chapters and six colonies of Triangle Fraternity active in the U.S. The headquarters is located in Plainfield, Indiana in a historic building erected as a Carnegie library in 1912.

==History==

Triangle was formed in the fall of 1906 by sixteen civil engineering juniors at the University of Illinois. It was formally incorporated on 15 April 1907. The date of incorporation has been designated as Founders&#x27; Day, and Triangle celebrates it every year at each chapter.

Triangle&#x27;s mission statement reads, &quot;The purpose of Triangle shall be to maintain a fraternity of engineers, architects and scientists. It shall carry out its purpose by establishing chapters that develop balanced men who cultivate high moral character, foster lifelong friendships, and live their lives with integrity.&quot;

==Symbols==
* Colors: Old Rose and Gray
* Coat of Arms: The crest consists of a rising sun beneath a Triangle T. Beneath is an esquire helmet in profile. At the center of the Coat of Arms is the fraternity&#x27;s shield and a ribbon containing the organization&#x27;s motto &quot;Veritas Omnia Vincit&quot; (Truth Conquers All). Surrounding the shield is a mantling.
* Flower: White Chrysanthemum
* Flag: The Coat of Arms on a Yellow T with Gray field.

==Code of Ethics==
Triangle Fraternity was founded on high ethical and moral ideals, and expects the men of the fraternity to follow a set Code of Ethics, which is as follows:

As a member of Triangle, I recognize my obligation to:

# Observe the precepts of the Fraternity as set forth in the Ritual;
# Accept cheerfully my full share of any task, however menial, involved in maintaining a chapter home;
# Preserve and promote the chosen ideals of my Fraternity;
# Pay all personal bills promptly, and always live within my means;
# Help create in my chapter home an environment in which enduring friendships may be formed;
# Maintain a creditable scholastic record;
# Promote the welfare of my profession;
# Maintain my self-respect by proper conduct at all times;
# Uphold faithfully the traditions and program of my Alma Mater;
# Pay the price of success in honest effort.

<doc id="477623" wikidata="Q17084581" url="?curid=477623" title="Bazooka Joe">
<text>Bazooka Joe is a comic strip character featured on small comics included in individually wrapped pieces of Bazooka bubble gum. He wears a black eyepatch, lending him a distinctive appearance. He is one of the more recognizable American advertising characters of the 20th century, due to worldwide distribution, and one of the few associated with a candy.

==Characters and story==
Bazooka Joe is joined in his various misadventures by a motley crew of characters, who came from the tradition of syndicated kid gang comic strips such as Gene Byrnes&#x27; &quot;Reg&#x27;lar Fellers&quot; and Ad Carter&#x27;s &quot;Just Kids&quot;. The group includes:
*Pesty (formerly Orville), Joe&#x27;s younger brother, with a 1950s cowboy sombrero
*Mort, a gangly boy who always wears his red turtleneck sweater pulled up over his mouth
*Hungry Herman, Joe&#x27;s tubby pal
*Jane, Joe&#x27;s girlfriend 
*Tuffy, a streetwise type who wears a sailor hat
*Walkie Talkie, a neighborhood mutt

The comics generally consist of child-friendly jokes, as well as small advertisements for kitschy merchandise one could obtain in exchange for comics and a few cents or dollars. From the very beginning in 1954, the bottom of the comics included &quot;fortunes&quot; similar to those one would find in a fortune cookie, sometimes with a comedic bent.

==Development==
Sometime between 1952 and 1954, Woody Gelman and Ben Solomon, heads of Product Development at Topps, approached cartoonist Wesley Morse to create &quot;Bazooka Joe and his Gang&quot;. The character was named after a contest was held asking for suggestions.

In &quot;Heroes of the Comics: Portraits of the Pioneering Legends of Comic Books&quot;, Drew Friedman wrote: &quot;Gelman, along with his friend and former co-animator Ben Solomon, created Popsicle Pete, who appeared in ads and packages for Popsicle ice pops for decades. Popsicle Pete caught the eye of president of the Topps Company, Arthur Shorin, who hired Gelman and Solomon to work for him full time in Brooklyn. Gelman worked as an editor and writer for Topps, and Solomon became its art director. Gelman soon became head of the new product development department, where he developed the Bazooka Joe mini-comics (drawn by Wesley Morse) and had his hand in many successful innovations for trading cards and other products.&quot;

&quot;Bazooka Joe&quot;&#x27;s style changed with the times. By the 1990s, Joe had adopted a more contemporary look, including low-slung, baggy jeans.

From 1967 to 1990, the main writer was cartoonist Jay Lynch.

Bazooka Joe comics were localized or translated for sale in other countries. For example, the Canadian version featured bilingual (simultaneous English and French) text balloons.

<text>HMAS &quot;Latrobe&quot; (J234/M234), named for the town of Latrobe, Tasmania, was one of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes constructed during World War II, and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Latrobe&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Latrobe&quot;″s dimensions differed from the &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class design: she was shorter ( compared to ) and had a slightly wider beam ( compared to ).

&quot;Latrobe&quot; was laid down by Mort&#x27;s Dock and Engineering Company at Balmain, New South Wales on 27 January 1942. As the ship was built in a dock it was floated clear on 19 June 1942. The ship was commissioned into the RAN on 6 November 1942.

==Operational history==
After entering active service, &quot;Latrobe&quot; initially served as a convoy escort ship, first between Queensland and New Guinea, then between Darwin and Thursday Island. On 12 February 1943, the corvette unsuccessfully attacked a Japanese submarine. In July, a Darwin-bound convoy escorted by &quot;Latrobe&quot; was attacked twice by Japanese aircraft, and in December, a lone Japanese bomber attempted to attack the corvette.

In June 1944, &quot;Latrobe&quot; was reassigned to New Guinea operations, and arrived on 17 June. She spent seven months operating as a convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol ship, before sailing to Adelaide in January 1945 for a two-month refit. &quot;Latrobe&quot; returned to New Guinea in late April, and served in numerous roles until the end of World War II, including escort, patrol, minesweeping, and shore bombardment.

The corvette received four battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Darwin 1943&quot;, &quot;Pacific 1943–45&quot;, &quot;New Guinea 1943–44&quot;, and &quot;Borneo 1945&quot;.

After the end of the war, &quot;Latrobe&quot; was involved in the evacuation of Allied prisoners-of-war, and the transportation of occupation forces. She returned to Australia in December 1945, towing two small craft to Sydney before proceeding to Melbourne. In early 1946, the corvette was attached to Flinders Naval Depot for use as a training ship until the end of 1952.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Latrobe&quot; paid off on 13 March 1953. She was placed in reserve on 17 September 1953, where she remained until she was sold for breaking up as scrap to the Hong Kong Rolling Mills on 18 May 1956.

<text>Sylver is a Belgian Eurodance and pop group, originally consisting of lead vocalist Silvy De Bie (born 4 January 1981), DJ and producer Regi Penxten (born 4 March 1976), and keyboardist/songwriter Wout Van Dessel (born 19 October 1974). They were active from 2000 until 2013, when De Bie decided to focus on her solo career, but they returned in 2016.

==History==
===2000–02: Career beginnings and &quot;Chances&quot;===

The band was formed in 2000 as &quot;Liquid feat. Silvy&quot; and released the single &quot;Turn the Tide&quot; in France and Belgium. The single was released in the rest of Europe in 2001 under the band&#x27;s new name, &quot;Sylver.&quot; In Germany, the single quickly rose to number 8 in the charts, and within eight weeks reached number 2 (behind Atomic Kitten&#x27;s &quot;Whole Again&quot;), staying in the top 10 for 12 weeks. The debut album &quot;Chances&quot; followed a month later, debuting at number 16 and spending 49 weeks in the top 100, making it Sylver&#x27;s most successful studio album to date. Follow-up singles &quot;Forever In Love&quot;, &quot;In Your Eyes,&quot; and &quot;Forgiven&quot; also charted successfully. In 2001, &quot;Skin&quot; was released exclusively in Belgium, while in 2002, &quot;The Smile Has Left Your Eyes&quot; was released as the sixth and final single, only in Spain, where it peaked at number 5.

===2003–05: &quot;Little Things&quot; and &quot;Nighttime Calls&quot;===
In 2003, the second album Little Things was released with similar success, peaking at number 7 on the Belgian album charts. It featured the hit singles &quot;Livin&#x27; My Life&quot; and &quot;Why Worry.&quot; Other singles from the album included the double A-side &quot;Shallow Water&quot;/&quot;Confused,&quot; and the fourth and final single &quot;Wild Horses,&quot; which was released in Belgium and Germany in 2003, though with limited success. On 2 November 2004, the third studio album Nighttime Calls was released. It became Sylver&#x27;s least successful studio album to date, peaking at only number 23 on the Belgian album charts. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Love is an Angel,&quot; entered the Belgian top 10 immediately upon its release on 20 September. In 2005, the follow-up singles &quot;Make It&quot; and &quot;Take Me Back&quot; were released, achieving moderate success in Belgium and Germany, respectively.

===2006–07: &quot;Crossroads&quot; and &quot;The Hit Collection&quot;===
The fourth studio album, Crossroads, was released in May 2006. The major hit was &quot;Lay All Your Love On Me,&quot; a cover of ABBA, marking Sylver&#x27;s first-ever cover version single release, which peaked at number 5 on the Belgian singles chart. From this point onward, in addition to using the synthesizer and drum machine, Sylver incorporated guitar, piano, and various percussion instruments, resulting in a more mature pop sound. Follow-up singles &quot;One Night Stand&quot; and &quot;Why&quot; were released as the second and third singles, respectively. In 2007, the band&#x27;s first compilation album, &quot;Best Of – The Hit Collection 2001–2007,&quot; was released, featuring &quot;The One&quot; as its sole single, which peaked at number 4 on the Belgian singles chart.

===2008–09: &quot;Sacrifice&quot; and Addition of John Miles Jr.===
In 2008, the singles &quot;One World, One Dream&quot; and &quot;Rise Again&quot; were released. In 2009, Sylver added English guitarist John Miles Jr. as their third band member. He had previously been part of the popular Belgian group Milk Inc.. As a trio, they released three more songs: &quot;I Hate You Now,&quot; a cover of Mike Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Foreign Affair,&quot; and &quot;Music,&quot; which was originally by John Miles Jr.&#x27;s father, John Miles, and also featured John Miles as a guest artist. Sylver&#x27;s fifth studio album, Sacrifice, was released on 8 May 2009 exclusively in Belgium, where it peaked at number 3 on the album charts. The album won the band the TMF award for &quot;Best Domestic Album&quot; in 2009.

===2010–12: &quot;Decade&quot; and Single Releases===
In 2010, Sylver released their second compilation album, &quot;Decade – The Very Best Of Sylver,&quot; to celebrate their 10th anniversary, with &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; being the only single from the album. The album peaked at number 1 on the Belgian album charts, becoming Sylver&#x27;s most successful album in Belgium, while the single achieved a top 20 spot on the Belgian singles chart. In addition to their anniversary, Sylver released a new version of their debut single, &quot;Turn the Tide.&quot; In 2011 and 2012, the singles &quot;Stop Feeling Sorry&quot; and &quot;City Of Angels&quot; were released as standalone singles. These two songs mark the final releases featuring original lead vocalist Silvy De Bie (aka Seeley&#x27;s Girl), who would leave the band the following year after thirteen years.

===2014: Departure of De Bie and Hiatus===
The group&#x27;s original lead vocalist, Silvy De Bie, left the band in early 2014, leaving the band without a vocalist and facing an uncertain future, which led the band to go on a temporary hiatus.

===2016 Return===
In the spring of 2016, the band officially announced their reunion and began writing new material. In 2017, they released the single &quot;Turn Your Love Around&quot;. 

In October 2019, Sylver released the single &quot;I Won&#x27;t Wait&quot; and announced their &quot;Sylver Lining Tour 2020,&quot; featuring a full live band to celebrate their 20-year anniversary. The tour was set to kick off at Concertzaal Casino in Sint-Niklaas, Belgium on 20 March 2020.

<doc id="477632" wikidata="Q4045101" url="?curid=477632" title="Ne Temere">
<text> was a decree issued in 1907 by the Roman Catholic Congregation of the Council regulating the canon law of the Church regarding marriage for practising Catholics. It is named for its opening words, which literally mean &quot;lest rashly&quot; in Latin.

==Issue==
The decree was issued under Pope Pius X, 10 August 1907, and took effect on Easter 19 April 1908. It concerned the validity of all marriages involving Catholics. Marriages in Germany were exempted by the subsequent decree .

==Differences from ==
To the clandestinity requirements of the decree of the Counter-Reformation Council of Trent, the decree reiterated the requirements that the marriage be witnessed by a priest and two other witnesses (adding that this requirement was now universal), added requirements that the priest (or bishop) being witness to the marriage must be the pastor of the parish (or the bishop of the diocese), or be the delegate of one of those, the marriage being invalid otherwise, and the marriage of a couple, neither one resident in the parish (or diocese), while valid, was illicit. It also required that marriages be registered.

On the success of a divorce action brought by a non-Catholic spouse, the Catholic spouse was still considered married in the eyes of the Church, and could not remarry to a third party in church.

It explicitly laid out that non-Catholics, including baptized ones, were not bound by Catholic canon law for marriage, and therefore could contract valid and binding marriages without compliance.

==Conflicts of laws==
In 1911, was criticised by Richard Hely-Hutchinson, 6th Earl of Donoughmore in the then United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland for declaring that the Catholic Church would consider invalid for a Catholic a marriage that they entered into in any way other than before the parish priest or a Catholic priest delegated by him, even if in civil law it was valid.

In March 1911, the issue of the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s canon law declaring invalid marriages that were recognised as valid by the State raised political and judicial issues in Canada when a judge of Quebec&#x27;s Superior Court confirmed the annulment by the Roman Catholic Church of the marriage of two Catholics which had been performed by a Methodist minister. The wife subsequently appealed the decision, saying that she had offered no defense in the original civil suit because she feared she might lose custody of her child. The appeal&#x27;s judge declared that the decree had &quot;no civil effect on said marriage,&quot; and that the Archbishop&#x27;s ecclesiastical decree of annulment had &quot;no judicial effect in said case&quot;. The previous civil judgement was declared nullified.

In New South Wales in 1924, the legislature came within one vote of criminalising the promulgation of the decree.

===McCann Case===
The McCann case of 1910 served as an example to Protestant Unionists of what would happen if Home Rule, or &quot;Rome Rule&quot; as they saw it, was implemented. The case concerned a couple in Belfast that had been married in a Protestant ceremony. The husband, who was Catholic, allegedly left his Protestant wife by the urging of a priest to the decree, taking their children with him. The controversy sparked outrage among the Protestant Unionists, and more than likely increased opposition to Home Rule.

===Tilson case===
 focused on the validity of marriages in which only one party was a Catholic. Although it did not specifically make any mention of children born to such marriages, it did require the issuance of a dispensation. A condition of the granting of said dispensation was a promise that any children born of such union would be raised in the Catholic faith.

In common law jurisdictions the father, by what is called the principle of &quot;paternal supremacy&quot;, has the right to decide the religious upbringing of all the children of the marriage. At first, this held also in the Republic of Ireland, even if he had entered into a contrary agreement in writing. The Supreme Court of Ireland still upheld paternal supremacy in 1945 in a judgement that the children, whose father had died, should be kept in a Protestant orphanage rather than be placed in the charge of the Catholic mother. It attributed no force to the signed promises that the father had made before the marriage nor to the argument that the 1937 Constitution of Ireland, adopted eight years earlier, declared that &quot;the State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society&quot;, and that it &quot;acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the Family&quot;. Largely because this judgement ignored the promises made in the prenuptial agreement, it caused deep resentment in Catholic circles.

In 1951 the Irish Supreme Court made a contrary judgement, upholding on appeal a 1950 High Court decision in a suit brought by a Catholic mother seeking the return of the four children whom their Protestant father had placed in a Protestant home to be raised as Protestants. The High Court ruled that the father was bound by the written undertaking he had given before marriage. The Supreme Court directed its attention to whether the prenuptial agreement was binding. Its own reasoning was that, &quot;in upholding the contractual validity of the pre-marriage promise given by [the father, it] was rejecting an archaic principle of British law that would be the object of public scorn if it still applied in Ireland today&quot;. It ruled that under the Irish Constitution the parents had &quot;a joint power and duty in respect of the religious education of their children&quot; and that neither parent had a right to dissolve an established contract. The 1950−1951 decision was confirmed in a 1957 ruling of the Irish High Court that was not appealed, and corresponds to a New York court&#x27;s decree upholding the binding character of such a prenuptial undertaking.

In its 2010 documentary &quot;Mixing Marriages&quot;, BBC Radio Ulster broadcast an account of how in 1908, although the decree did not declare invalid the marriages previously entered into otherwise than before the parish priest of the Catholic spouse, a Catholic father, who in vain demanded that his Presbyterian wife, whom he had married in a Presbyterian church, repeat the ceremony before a Catholic priest and allow their children to be brought up as Catholics, abandoned her and took away their two small children. Ensuing publicity by the local Presbyterian minister was a factor in turning Presbyterians against Irish Home Rule.

== (1970)==
 was superseded in 1970 with the motu proprio issued by Pope Paul VI.

The Pope:

# Took the view that &quot;mixed marriages, precisely because they admit differences of religion and are a consequence of division among Christians, do not, except in some cases, help in re-establishing unity among Christians.&quot;
# Wrote that &quot;there are many difficulties inherent in a mixed marriage, since a certain division is introduced into the living cell of the Church&quot;
# Added that &quot;in the family itself the fulfilment of the gospel teaching is more difficult because of diversities in matters of religion, especially in regard to those matters which concern Christian worship and the education of the children&quot;.
# Stated that &quot;For these reasons the Church[...] discourages the contracting of mixed marriages, for she is most desirous that Catholics be able in matrimony to attain to perfect union of mind and full communion of life. However since man has the natural right to marry and beget children,&quot; the Church wished to make arrangements to ensure &quot;that the principles of divine law be scrupulously observed and that[...] [the] right to contract marriages be respected&quot;.
# Stated that although the Church was relaxing ecclesiastical discipline in particular cases, &quot;she can never remove the obligation of the Catholic party which, by divine law, namely by the plan of salvation instituted by Christ, is imposed according to the various situations&quot;.
# Stressed that &quot;the Catholic partner in a mixed marriage is obliged[...] as far as possible, to see that the children be baptised and brought up in that same faith and receive all those aids to eternal salvation which the Catholic Church provides for her sons and daughters&quot;.
# Noted that &quot;the problem of the children&#x27;s education is a particularly difficult one, in view of the fact that both husband and wife are bound by that responsibility and may by no means ignore it or any of the obligations connected with it&quot;.
# Acknowledged that in this area &quot;the canonical discipline[...] cannot be uniform&quot; and &quot;must be adapted to[...] the distinct circumstances of the married couple and the differing degrees of their ecclesiastical communion.&quot;

Section 15 revoked the automatic excommunication imposed by the 1917 Code of Canon Law for marrying before a non-Catholic minister or for failing to secure the Catholic upbringing of the children. The 1970 apostolic letter made the granting of a dispensation by the Ordinary conditional on a promise by the Catholic spouse to remove all danger of defecting from the faith and to do all that he or she can to have all the children baptized and brought up in the Catholic Church. The non-Catholic partner was to be made aware of these promises made by the Catholic spouse (sections 4 and 5).

This removed the requirement that both the Catholic and non-Catholic spouse must pledge to raise their children as Catholics during the wedding, which was criticized as &quot;legislating for Protestants&quot;.

The regulations in have been maintained in the 1983 Code of Canon Law. In 1996, in a letter to the Irish Times, the Director of the Catholic Press and Information Office, Dublin stated &quot;[T]he Catholic Church&#x27;s current practice in relation to mixed marriages[...] the new [1991] [standard prenuptial inquiry] form includes the following questions to be asked of all Catholics[...] Do you promise to do what you can within the unity of your partnership to have all the children of your marriage baptised and brought up in the Catholic faith?[...] nothing more in the way of undertakings is required of the Catholic partner in a mixed marriage than is required of Catholics marrying one another.&quot; The letter therefore makes it clear that nothing less in the way of undertakings was required of the Catholic partner in a mixed marriage than was required of Catholics marrying one another.

In 1972, two years after the abolition of the decree, the New Ulster Movement publication &quot;Two Irelands or one?&quot;, commenting also on the related 1957 Fethard-on-Sea boycott, declared: The removal of the protection of the courts, granted since the Tilson judgement of 1950, to the decree of the Roman Catholic Church. This decree which requires the partners in a mixed marriage to promise that all the children of their marriage be brought up as Roman Catholics, is the internal rule of one particular Church. For State organs to support it is, therefore, discriminatory. The NUM dissolved in 1978.

<text>Howard Wallace Pollock (April 11, 1920 – January 9, 2011) was an American politician and Republican Representative from Alaska.

==Biography==
Pollock was born in Chicago to Olga (née Deblanc) and Oscar Tobias Pollock, and grew up in New Orleans. He went to high school in Perkinston, Mississippi and graduated from Perkinston Junior College. He enlisted as a seaman in the United States Navy in 1941 and retired with rank of lieutenant commander in 1946. During his service in World War II, he lost his right forearm to a grenade accident while training in the South Pacific in 1944.

He studied law at Santa Clara University School of Law and at the University of Houston, and then did some post-graduate studies at MIT, from which he earned a M.S. in industrial management. He was a practicing attorney.

Pollock served in the Alaska Territorial Legislature from 1953 to 1955. He later served in the Alaska Senate from 1961 to 1963 and 1965–1966; and was elected as a Republican to the Ninetieth and Ninety-first Congresses (January 3, 1967 – January 3, 1971), being the first Republican elected to Congress from Alaska. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1970 to the Ninety-second Congress, but rather was an unsuccessful candidate for Republican nomination for Governor of Alaska. Pollock was also a past president of the National Rifle Association of America.

From 1998 until his death in January 2011, Pollock was a resident of Arlington, Virginia.

<doc id="477639" wikidata="Q381722" url="?curid=477639" title="The Australian Pink Floyd Show">
<text>The Australian Pink Floyd Show, more frequently referred to as the Australian Pink Floyd, is a Pink Floyd tribute band formed in 1988 in Adelaide, South Australia. Their live shows attempt to recreate the look, feel, and sound of Pink Floyd&#x27;s later world tours, employing visual aids such as lasers, inflatables and a large display panel similar to &quot;Mr Screen&quot;. The Australian Pink Floyd Show plays venues worldwide.

The band is noted for replicating the nuances of Pink Floyd&#x27;s work. Steve Mac&#x27;s guitar rig closely resembles David Gilmour&#x27;s set-up, and includes elements custom-produced by Pete Cornish, who worked extensively with Gilmour. The band associates itself with individuals who have worked with Pink Floyd over the years, including Colin Norfield (who worked as a sound engineer for Gilmour in his solo career and for Pink Floyd during their 1994 Division Bell Tour) and Clive Brooks – Nick Mason&#x27;s long-time drum technician.

The show includes a round screen with intelligent lights arranged around its perimeter. During a concert, movies and animations are displayed on-screen, complementing the band&#x27;s light show. Inflatables (such as the pig used by Pink Floyd during the Division Bell Tour, and &quot;Skippy&quot; – the band&#x27;s own giant pink kangaroo and named after the Australian TV series &quot;Skippy The Bush Kangaroo&quot;) are frequently employed in the band&#x27;s shows.

== Band members ==
Though various musicians have come and gone over the years, the Australian Pink Floyd Show continues to base itself around its three &#x27;longest-serving&#x27; members : Steve Mac, Colin Wilson and Jason Sawford. The current line up consists of:

* Steve Mac – guitar, vocals (1988–present)
* Colin Wilson – bass guitar, vocals (1993–2015)
* Jason Sawford – keyboards (1988–2025)
* Paul Bonney – drums (1998–present)
* David Domminney Fowler – guitar, vocals (2010–present)
* Emily Lynn – backing vocals (2010–present)
* Lara Smiles – backing vocals (2010–present)
* Lorelei McBroom – backing vocals (2011–present)
* Chris Barnes – vocals (2015–present)
* Ricky Howard – bass guitar, vocals (2015–present)
* Luc Ledy-Lepine – guitar (2022–present)
* David Parsons – keyboards (2022–present)
* Alex Francois – saxophones (2022–present)

== History ==
=== 1988–2000 ===
The band was originally formed in 1988 in Adelaide, South Australia, by guitarist Lee Smith. Smith placed an advert in Allan&#x27;s Music, a city music store, which read &quot;Vocalist and Keyboardist required for band. Professional attitude expected. We only play Pink Floyd&quot;. Vocalist and guitarist Steve Mac, and keyboardist Jason Sawford joined the existing line up of Grant Ross (drummer), Trevor Turton (bass) and Smith (guitars). Their first live show was performed to a select group of family and friends. The band settled on the name &quot;Think Floyd&quot;, and thereafter played a number of venues around Adelaide until the lack of a regular audience saw them drift apart.

By 1992, when Mac and Smith refocused efforts to bring Think Floyd to a larger audience, Turton had left the band. Peter Whiteley (bass/vocals) was auditioned and joined the band during rehearsals for an interstate tour of Australia&#x27;s East coast due to take place the following year in May 1993. During the period of rehearsals, Mac visited family in the UK where he met with Glenn Povey, publisher of the most popular Pink Floyd fanzine of that time, &#x27;Brain Damage&#x27;. During the meeting it was decided that Think Floyd should headline Povey&#x27;s planned Pink Floyd fan convention to be held at Wembley in August 1993. The purpose of Think Floyd&#x27;s 1993 East coast tour became one of raising funds for the band&#x27;s trip to the UK. At the end of the East coast tour Whiteley left the band, and was replaced by bassist and vocalist Colin Wilson.

Think Floyd was renamed &#x27;The Australian Pink Floyd Show&#x27; prior to their departure for England on 8 August 1993. TAPFS&#x27;s first UK show was a hugely successful three-hour performance at Povey&#x27;s Wembley convention. Such was the enthusiastic reception of TAPFS that Povey took responsibility for booking the band numerous shows in the UK throughout the remainder of 1993. Despite the immense success and growing popularity of TAPFS, its founding member Lee Smith left the band towards the end of that year and returned to Australia citing homesickness.

In 1994, David Gilmour attended an Australian Pink Floyd Show performance at the Fairfield Halls in Croydon. He subsequently invited the band to attend the end-of-tour after-show party for The Division Bell Tour at Earls Court in London.

The Australian Pink Floyd is the only Pink Floyd tribute act to play for a member of Pink Floyd; in 1996 they performed at David Gilmour&#x27;s 50th birthday party.

In 1995, the band appeared on Irish national television, performing &quot;Young Lust&quot; on the chat show &quot;Kenny Live&quot;.

In 1998, the band played Glastonbury, performing on the acoustic stage.

=== 2000–2010 ===
In 2004, the band performed &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; at the King&#x27;s Dock, Liverpool. The performance was recorded and released as a DVD the same year. This was released as a two-DVD set with the full concert on disc one and bonuses on disc two. Also in 2004, the band commenced a major tour of the United States, Canada, Germany, and Italy, including a show in Switzerland. The Liverpool Pops DVD (and more recently the 2004 Royal Albert Hall performance) has aired on television in the United States.

In 2005, the band released a CD of their renditions of &quot;Animals&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; at the Liverpool Pops Festival. In the same year the band undertook a two-week tour of South America consisting of dates in Mexico City, Buenos Aires, and Brazil. A documentary about the group was shot at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec and broadcast in North America on the Discovery Channel in 2007.

In 2007, the band performed at several major European Music Festivals, including the Sweden Rock Festival, the Malta Jazz Festival, the Arrow Rock Festival, Rock Werchter, and Festival do Sudoeste. A DVD of the band performing at the Royal Albert Hall in London in 2007 was released later that year.

In September 2007, the group commenced its longest ever continuous tour of the Americas, performing for the first time in Panama, Venezuela, and Chile. In the same month a performance of the show in Buenos Aires was aired on Argentine national television as part of the Pepsi music festival

February 2008 saw the group commence their &quot;Best of The Wall&quot; tour in a five-week tour of Europe, performing in Spain, Luxembourg, Poland, Norway, and (for the first time) the Czech Republic and Israel.

The group performed at the Isle of Wight Festival in June 2008, were the headline act of the last night of Guilfest 2008, and in August of the same year made their first appearance at the Lokerse Feesten in Lokeren, Belgium.

The band played their first shows in Ukraine and Slovakia in September 2008.

A complete production of &quot;The Wall&quot;, incorporating new animation based on the original Gerald Scarfe imagery, was performed for the first time by the band during their 2008 North American tours. The production continued throughout the 2009 European tour, which included dates in the United Kingdom, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Italy, Switzerland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, France, Spain, Portugal and, for the first time, Serbia.

Mid 2009 saw the group perform for the first time in Austria at the Lovely Days Festival in Wiesen, and the Castle Clam Classic Rock Festival in Klam. In the June they were the closing act of the Bospop festival in the Netherlands.

Early 2010 saw the band commence its longest ever tour of Europe, playing in Croatia for the first time.

=== Since 2010 ===

In 2010, new management was appointed and David Domminney Fowler was recruited as a guitarist, alongside vocalist Alex McNamara.

2011 saw the introduction of 3D stereoscopic projection and quadrophonic sound into the band&#x27;s performances. The Australian Pink Floyd is the first ever band to implement stereographic 3D on tour.

Performing in June 2011 at the Hampton Court Palace Festival in London, the band was joined by Guy Pratt, long-time session bass player for Pink Floyd, for a rendition of Run Like Hell.

For the North American segment of their 2011 tour, the band added Lorelei McBroom as a backing vocalist. Lorelei had previously performed live with Pink Floyd on the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour in 1988 and 1989. At a show in Anaheim, Lorelei was joined by her sister Durga McBroom,-- she had sung for Pink Floyd on the Momentary Lapse and Division Bell tours – to sing The Great Gig in the Sky.

In 2012, the Australian Pink Floyd completed their &quot;Exposed in the Light&quot; tour. Lorelei McBroom rejoined the group for both the European and North American segments of the tour.

In 2013, the band toured Europe with their &quot;Eclipsed By The Moon&quot; tour, celebrating the 40th anniversary of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. In July 2013 the band played in front of the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank in England.

In 2016, Chris Barnes (vocals) and Ricky Howard (bass/vocals) were welcomed to the TAPFS family.

2022 seen new members Luc Ledy-Lepine (guitar), Alex Francois (saxophone) and David Parsons (Keyboards) join the band.

On January, 9th, 2025, Jason Sawford died. The band announce his death on YouTube.

<text>HMAS &quot;Lismore&quot; (J145/B247/A121), named for the city of Lismore, New South Wales, was one of 60 Bathurst-class corvettes that were constructed during World War II, and one of 20 manned and commissioned by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) under Admiralty order. During her Australian service, Lismore covered , and spent the longest period away from Australia of any RAN vessel during World War II: 1,409 days. Serving with the RAN for five years, &quot;Lismore&quot; later spent twelve years as part of the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNLN), classified as the frigate HNLMS &quot;Batjan&quot;.

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 ordered by the RAN, 20 (including &quot;Lismore&quot;) ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Lismore&quot; was laid down by Morts Dock &amp; Engineering Co in Sydney on 26 February 1940. She was launched on 10 August 1940 by the wife of Commodore Gerard Muirhead-Gould, the Naval-Officer-in-Charge Sydney, and commissioned on 25 January 1941.

==Operational service==
From December 1941 &quot;Lismore&quot; operated with the British Eastern Fleet. On 17 June 1943, when the British troopship was sunk off the coast of Libya, &quot;Lismore&quot; and her sister ship were among the ships that rescued 1,477 survivors. In December 1944, &quot;Lismore&quot; was assigned to the British Pacific Fleet.

The corvette earned four battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Indian Ocean 1941–44&quot;, &quot;Sicily 1943&quot;, &quot;Pacific 1945&quot;, and &quot;Okinawa 1945&quot;.

&quot;Lismore&quot; was paid off from RAN service on 3 July 1946, transferring immediately into the Royal Netherlands Navy, where she was renamed HNLMS &quot;Batjan&quot; and reclassified as a frigate. She was removed from service in 1958.

<text>The University of California, Merced (UC Merced or colloquially, UCM) is a public land-grant research university in Merced, California, United States. It is one of the ten campuses in the University of California (UC) system. Established in 2005, UC Merced is the newest campus within the UC system. The primary campus is located around five miles north of Merced and sits adjacent to Lake Yosemite. The main campus is around 1,026 acres (415 ha) in size. Large swaths of protected natural grasslands surround the university.

The forming of UC Merced was initiated to address population growth of the San Joaquin Valley, and to make higher education more accessible. UC Merced consists of three undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools. The upcoming medical school is being established in partnership with UCSF and their satellite campus, UCSF Fresno in order to address the lack of healthcare services available in the San Joaquin Valley. The first medical building, which is set to open in 2026, will be the home for the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) PRIME+ program, a program that combines four years of undergraduate work with four years of medical school. UC Merced offers over 60 undergraduate degrees and 18 graduate and professional degrees and roughly 8,000 undergraduates and 700 graduate students were enrolled at UCM as of fall 2023. The university is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High research activity&quot; and had $45.9 million in research and development expenditures in 2021.

UC Merced is one of the largest employers in Merced County and contributes about $1.7 billion to the economy of the San Joaquin Valley. The UC Merced Golden Bobcats currently compete in the NAIA as members of the Cal Pac. In 2025, the university plans to move to NCAA Division II.

==History==
=== Founding ===
On May 19, 1988, the UC Regents voted to begin planning for a campus in the region in response to increasing enrollment and growth constraints at existing UC campuses. In 1989, they authorized UC President David P. Gardner to plan up to three new campuses to address these needs. The search quickly was narrowed to California&#x27;s Central Valley, which was the state&#x27;s largest and most populous region without its own UC campus. Soon over 100 offers from across the state were submitted to try and bring the new campus to their community including Fresno, Los Banos, Madera, Manteca, Merced, Redding, Turlock, and Tuolumne County. In 1992 the UC board of regents selected three finalist for the new campus Fresno, Madera, and Merced; but officials delayed any movement forward until early 1993 due to budget concerns. Members of the state legislature had pushed back at the expense of the campus including state senator John Burton calling the campus the &quot;biggest boondoggle ever&quot;. Another delay on the site selection occurred when environmental impact reports for Madera and Merced had to be reevaluated to address concerns raised by that they had been done incorrectly. On May 19, 1995, the Regents selected Merced over the two other finalist sites in Madera and Fresno. Lake Yosemite is situated very close to the general campus area, and would provide a unique scenic backdrop for the university. A lake being situated near the campus would be a differentiation factor for the Merced campus when compared to the other nine University of California campuses.

An important hurdle to the construction of UC Merced was removed with the passage of Proposition 203 (Public Education Facilities Bond Act) in March 1996. The Act allows the issuance of bonds to fund the construction of new buildings for school facilities. An additional $55 million in funding for the campus was secured by state assembly member Dennis Cardoza to ensure that the other nine University of California campuses would not have their budgets affected. In 1999 the UC Regents selected Carol Tomlinson-Keasey as the first chancellor of the university where she became an effective lobbyists for additional state funding.

As part of the package for the Merced site the Virginia Smith Estate provided of land for the new campus. The university originally planned to conserve to protect sensitive vernal pool habitats but later expanded it to with the creation of the Merced Vernal Pools and Grassland Reserve which is now part of the University of California Natural Reserve System. A public golf course known as the Merced Hills Golf Course had been constructed at the site in the 1996. This course was shut down to make way for the new campus when the original site for the campus was made unavailable due to the discovery of fairy shrimp – an endangered species – on the originally proposed site. Since the construction of the golf course had negated concerns about wetland and vernal pool environmental issues, building the campus at this location was easier than fighting to save the original construction site.

In 1997 UC Merced had created an office at Merced College, and in 1999 built a temporary office facility at the nearby decommissioned Castle Airforce Base. UC Merced established a satellite campus in Bakersfield, California in 2001 in its downtown University Square. The satellite campus extended a UC education to prospective college-bound students of Kern County and the southern San Joaquin Valley before UC Merced opened its official campus in Merced. Classes and counseling were also provided at the Bakersfield center to newly admitted UC students. In 2011, the Bakersfield campus was permanently closed citing cost-cutting efforts and for the university to balance its finances.

=== Recent history ===
The campus groundbreaking ceremony was held October 25, 2002, and the first day of undergraduate classes was September 6, 2005 with 706 freshmen, 132 transfer students, and 37 graduate students. First Lady Michelle Obama gave the commencement address for the university&#x27;s first full graduating class. The campaign to bring Michelle Obama to campus was started by the students of the graduating class where they wrote over 900 cards asking her to come. The commencement was the First Lady&#x27;s first commencement speaker event.

With the start of the great recession between 2007 and 2009 the University of California was hit with budget cuts by the state. During this time Andrew Scull and 22 other faculty members from UC San Diego authored a letter calling for UC Merced, UC Riverside, and UC Santa Cruz to be closed as a way to save money. Their reasoning was that these institutions were &quot;in substantial measure teaching institutions&quot;. In response to this UC President Mark Yudoff wrote a letter to the leaders of all ten campuses to insure them that there would be no campus closures.

In 2010, the United States Census Bureau made UC Merced its own separate census-designated place. Later the same year, the new student housing facilities, The Summits, opened to provide two additional residential halls for incoming students. The two four-story buildings, Tenaya Hall and Cathedral Hall, are reserved primarily for incoming freshmen students. Three years later, another housing facility, Half Dome, was built next to the existing Tenaya and Cathedral Halls. Half Dome houses both freshman and continuing students. The university is a census-designated place (CDP) that is uninhabited as of both the 2010 and 2020 census. In addition to lacking population the university covers all of its land in this census-designated place.

In January 2015, UC Merced was nationally classified with the Carnegie Classification for community engagement, along with UC Davis and UCLA. Later that year the University of California started the push to expand the campus capacity to 10,000 students and double its square footage as part of Project 2020. The expansion would be the largest growth in both buildings and students on campus to date, and includes dorms, offices, classrooms and recreation areas.

On November 4, 2015, 18-year-old student Faisal Mohammad stabbed and injured four people with a hunting knife before being shot to death by a campus police officer.

In November 2015, the Regents of the University of California approved a $1.14 billion proposal, known as the 2020 Plan, to double the capacity of UC Merced, boosting its enrollment by nearly 4,000 students. The new buildings were completed in early 2021.
In April 2019, the school&#x27;s student government, the Associated Students of UC Merced, cut off funding for UC Merced&#x27;s only student-run newspaper, &quot;The Prodigy&quot;.

UC Merced claims to be the only institution in the United States all of whose buildings have been LEED certified. Its Triple Net Zero Commitment is expected to create zero net landfill waste and zero net greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2020.

UC Merced announced a partnership with UCSF and UCSF Fresno to create a new medical school program by the year 2026, with support from governor Gavin Newsom. The SJV Prime Program which opened its doors in 2011, is part of the upcoming UC Merced School of Medicine. It is specifically focused on preparing and training students to become future doctors who will serve the underserved communities in the Central Valley of California. The SJV Prime program at UC Merced is a unique initiative designed to address the healthcare needs of the area, a region in California that faces significant health disparities due to its socio-economic challenges, high levels of poverty, and a shortage of healthcare professionals. UC Merced&#x27;s School of Medicine also collaborates with UC San Francisco medical schools, which strengthens educational opportunities available to SJV Prime students and connects them to broader networks of medical professionals. It is an innovative medical education pathway that allows students to complete four years of an undergraduate degree followed by four years of medical school, with a focus on producing healthcare providers who are committed to serving the underserved communities of the San Joaquin Valley.

==Organization and administration==

===Governance===
Being one of the ten general campuses of the University of California system, UC Merced is governed by a 26-member Board of Regents consisting of 18 officials appointed by the Governor of California, seven &quot;ex officio&quot; members, and a single student regent. The current president of the University of California is Michael Drake, and the administrative head of UC Merced is Juan Sánchez Muñoz. Academic policies are set by each of the school&#x27;s Academic Senate, and a legislative body including all university faculty members. Nine vice chancellors manage academic affairs, research, diversity, marine sciences, student affairs, planning, external relations, business affairs, and health sciences and report directly to the chancellor.

Carol Tomlinson-Keasey was the first chancellor of the university and held the position from 1999 until she resigned on August 31, 2006. On September 21, 2006, the Regents named Roderic B. Park, a former interim chancellor at the University of Colorado at Boulder, as the acting chancellor for UC Merced. Park remained acting chancellor until Sung-Mo (Steve) Kang, Dean of the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz, took office in early March 2007. Kang held the position until 2011.

After a nationwide search, on May 24, 2011, the Regents of the University of California named Dorothy Leland, then president of Georgia College &amp; State University, to be the university&#x27;s newest chancellor. On May 13, 2019, Leland announced that she would be stepping down from her position, effective August 15, 2019. UC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Nathan Brostrom served as interim chancellor until July 2020. In July 2020, Juan Sánchez Muñoz, then president of University of Houston-Downtown, was appointed to the position of Chancellor. UCM&#x27;s Chancellors are listed below:

===List of chancellors===


===Funding===
UC Merced gets funding from a variety of federal, state, and private sources. With the exception of some government contracts, public support is apportioned to UC Merced and the other campuses of the University of California system through the UC Office of the President and accounts for a large percentage of the university&#x27;s total revenues.

==Academics==
UC Merced has three schools offering 27 undergraduate majors and 25 minors:

* School of Engineering
* School of Natural Sciences
* School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts

In 2011, the campus was granted accreditation by WASC. In 2014, the School of Engineering received an ABET accreditation for the Mechanical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, and Materials Science and Engineering programs.

The university is also home to the CCBM Summer Internship Program, an undergraduate research fellowship for non-UC Merced students sponsored by the NSF CREST Center for Cellular and Biomolecular Machines. The campus takes advantage of the surrounding environment by investigating issues relating to environmental systems of the Central Valley and Sierra Nevada, and of its youth by having programs in genetic research conducted in state-of-the-art research labs. It also benefits from proximity to Silicon Valley and other major universities. Research in fields like language acquisition and cultural issues is facilitated by the highly diverse ethnic makeup of the Central Valley. UC Merced operates on a semester system rather than the quarter system for its academic term. The Berkeley campus is the only other UC campus on a semester system.

Exclusive to UC Merced, The San Joaquin Valley (SJV) PRIME+ program, is an academic program that combines four years of undergraduate work with four years of medical school. The program offers students a diverse range of academic majors, also offered to the other students at the university, designed to prepare them for healthcare and medical sciences. Students in the undergraduate portion of their education can choose from specialized tracks that align with their academic interests and career goals that include four main areas: biological sciences, bioengineering, chemistry, or public health. The program&#x27;s curriculum is structured to provide a solid foundation for both undergraduate studies and future professional education in medicine at the medical school. For students entering the medical school portion of their education, the curriculum is designed to build on their undergraduate studies while offering specialized training to address the unique healthcare challenges of the Central Valley of California. The medical school portion emphasizes not only advanced medical knowledge but also the development of skills necessary for providing care in underserved and rural communities, particularly in the central valley. These courses address the unique healthcare needs of the Central Valley&#x27;s residents, including agricultural workers, immigrant populations, and low-income families. Students in the program study the challenges faced by rural healthcare providers, such as workforce shortages, limited healthcare access, and the higher prevalence of certain diseases in agricultural communities as well as preventative care for these issues.

===Rankings===



UC Merced was tied for 42nd &quot;Top Public School&quot; and tied for 97th in the 2022 rankings of &quot;Best National Universities&quot; in the U.S. by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. Also in the same rankings, it was ranked 5th in &quot;Top Performers on Social Mobility&quot;, 171st in &quot;Best Value Schools&quot;, and tied for 123th in &quot;Best Undergraduate Engineering Programs&quot; at schools whose highest degree is a doctorate. In 2024, &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; ranked UC Merced 72nd among 438 national universities in the U.S. based on UC Merced&#x27;s contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service.

==Admissions and enrollment==
UC Merced received 25,368 undergraduate applications for admission for the Fall 2019 incoming freshman class; 18,263 were admitted (72.0%).

Undergraduate enrollment in Fall 2019 was 51.7% women, 47.5% men and 0.8% unknown; approximately 99% were from California.

In 2021 UC Merced received a record-breaking number of applications totaling 30,105 freshman and transfer applications.

The graduate school application pool in 2022 consisted of 40% women and 23% minority students.

The SJV Prime program is an initiative designed for students from the San Joaquin Valley, separate from the regular UC Merced application. Admission to the program is requires candidates to demonstrate exceptional academic performance, a strong record of extracurricular involvement, and a clear commitment to pursuing advanced education. To be eligible, applicants must meet several criteria. The application process involves completing an online application, where students submit academic transcripts, standardized test scores, and their personal statement for the UC system. Additionally, applicants are required to fill out a supplemental application for the SJV Prime program by submitting letters of recommendation from teachers or mentors who can attest to their academic abilities, leadership potential, and commitment to learning. Finally, applicants must submit an additional personal statement or essay outlining their academic goals, career aspirations, and reasons for applying to the SJV Prime Program.

== Research institutes ==
* Health Sciences Research Institute (HSRI)
* Sierra Nevada Research Institute (SNRI)
* University of California Advanced Solar Technologies Institute (UC Solar)
*NSF CREST Center for Cellular and Biomolecular Machines (CCBM)
*Merced nAnomaterials Center for Energy and Sensing (MACES)
*Nicotine and Cannabis Policy Center (NCPC)

In 2007, UC Merced researchers obtained nearly $7 million in funding from the National Science Foundation. Grant funding for research has reached over $168.9 million in 2013.

== Campus ==
The campus is bounded by Lake Yosemite on one side. Two irrigation canals run through the campus. The campus master plan was developed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, its initial infrastructure by Arup, and its first buildings were designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, Thomas Hacker and Associates, and EHDD Architecture. The library and central power plant have been classified as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold structures in terms of their high energy efficiency and low environmental impact. The campus is located about seven miles (11 km) north of downtown Merced in the middle of a cattle ranch.

Rather than build on of protected land east of Lake Yosemite, where endangered fairy shrimp hatch in vernal pools, the school has built on a parcel of grazing land south of campus, under a revised layout. The revised plan covers a total of rather than the original proposed in 2000. The new design was expected to impact a total of of native wetlands in the region compared to the forecast in the 2000 footprint.

The Science and Engineering Building 2 opened in 2014. The Classroom and Office Building 2 opened in 2016.

=== Kolligian Library ===
The library was the first building to open on campus. During the Fall 2005 semester, while construction of other buildings was still underway, all academic courses were conducted in the library. Its official motto is &quot;Not what other research libraries are, what they will be.&quot;

The library contains more electronic holdings than print holdings, consisting of about 70,000 online journals and 3.965 million electronic books (including 3.15 million HathiTrust full-text books), compared to 102,000 print books. It provides access to 937 databases.

Kolligian is a Green library and has Gold LEED certification.

==Athletics==
The UC Merced athletic teams are called the Golden Bobcats. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the California Pacific Conference (Cal Pac) since the 2011–12 academic year.

UC Merced competes in nine intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer and volleyball; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, volleyball and water polo.

===Facilities===
In 2006, the university opened its gymnasium. The Joseph Edward Gallo Recreation and Wellness Center features an &quot;NCAA-sized basketball court, workout facilities, room for performances, wellness and fitness education and the Rajender Reddy Student Health Center&quot;.

==Student life==

Approximately 2,100 students currently live on campus in the Valley and Sierra Terraces and the Summits, which includes Tenaya and Cathedral Halls, 4.2 miles (6.8 km) away from the city of Merced. The most recent addition is Half Dome Hall which completed the UC Merced&#x27;s first residential square. Many students choose to live in new housing subdivisions off campus.

The university&#x27;s Campus Activities Board (CAB) organizes campus-wide activities such as concerts, movies, and dances.

Student publications include the newspaper &quot;The Prodigy&quot;, Bobcat Radio, &quot;The Undergraduate Research Journal&quot;, &quot;The Undergraduate Historical Journal&quot;, and literary journals &quot;The Kumquat&quot; and &quot;Imagination Dead Imagine&quot;. &quot;The Vernal Pool&quot; is a student publication for writing and visual art.

=== CatTracks public transportation system ===
The university operates its own public transportation system, CatTracks. The system has several routes serving off-campus housing developments and locations in central Merced, about from campus.

===Student government===
Associated Students of the University of California Merced (ASUCM) is the student government that represents the undergraduate students on campus. ASUCM funds student clubs and organizations including a campus visit from Karl Rove in 2010. The organization&#x27;s Campus Activities Board brings outside talent to campus including comedians and musical acts.

==Alumni==
The UC Merced Alumni Association (UCMAA) consists of more than 16,000 living members.

As stated by the &quot;LA Times&quot; in 2016, &quot;Although most UC Merced alumni are still in their 20s, 11% of them contributed to their alma mater — outstripping the giving rate of all other UC campuses except UC Santa Barbara (16%) and UC Berkeley (12%). UCLA&#x27;s rate was 8%, and UC Riverside, the most comparable campus, was 4%.&quot;

<text>The , initially designated , is Japan&#x27;s first turbojet-powered aircraft. It was developed late in World War II, and the single completed prototype flew only once, in August 1945, before the end of the conflict.

==Design and development==
After the Japanese military attaché in Germany witnessed trials of the Messerschmitt Me 262 in 1942, the Imperial Japanese Navy issued a request to Nakajima to develop a similar aircraft to be used as a fast attack aircraft. Requirements included being built largely with unskilled labor, and that the wings should fold. This would enable the aircraft to be hidden in tunnels and aircraft shelters around Japan as the navy began to prepare for the defense of the home islands. Nakajima designers Kenichi Matsumura and Kazuo Ohno laid out an aircraft that bore just a superficial resemblance to the Me 262.

The &quot;Kikka&quot; was initially to use the Tsu-11, a motorjet engine that was essentially a piston engine with a ducted fan with an afterburner, similar to those used in Russia and Italy at the time. Subsequently the Ne-10 (TR-10) centrifugal-flow turbojet, and the Ne-12, which added a four-stage axial compressor to the front of the Ne-10 were evaluated, however tests revealed that these did not produce enough power, and the project stalled. It was then decided to use a new axial flow turbojet based on the German BMW 003.

Development of the engine was troubled, as it was based on little more than photographs and a single cut-away drawing of the BMW 003, however, the Ishikawajima Ne-20 was quickly built and by mid-1945, the &quot;Kikka&quot; project was progressing again. At this stage, due to the deteriorating war situation, it is possible that the Navy considered the &quot;Kikka&quot; for &quot;kamikaze&quot; missions, but this is questionable due to the cost and complexity. Other more economical projects designed for &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks, such as the simpler Nakajima Ki-115 Tōka (which used obsolete engines), the pulsejet Kawanishi Baika, and the rocket Yokosuka Ohka, were either underway or already in mass production.

Compared to the Me 262, the &quot;Kikka&quot; airframe was noticeably smaller (with just 4/5ths of the span) and more conventional, with straight wings (lacking the slight sweepback of the Me 262). The triangular fuselage cross section characteristic of the German design was also absent. To accelerate development, the main landing gear was adapted from the A6M Zero and the nose wheel from a Yokosuka P1Y bomber tailwheel.

===Designation===
The &quot;Kikka&quot; is sometimes identified as the J9N1, or occasionally J9Y1, which according to a National Air and Space Museum researcher is incorrect and no such designation appears in any records associated with the design. The official name assigned was and like some other Navy aircraft at the very end of the war, it received only a name. Imperial Japanese Naval aircraft until then had normally designated with a similar system to that used on U.S. Navy aircraft of the time, in which the first letter denotes the role, a number denotes the design in the sequence (starting with 1), and a second letter denotes the company that developed it, followed by a number indicating subtype.

==Operational history==
The first prototype commenced ground tests at the Nakajima factory on 30 June 1945. The following month, it was dismantled and delivered to Kisarazu Naval Airfield where it was re-assembled and prepared for flight testing. The first flight took place on 7 August 1945 (the day after Hiroshima was bombed by atomic bomb), with Lieutenant Commander Susumu Takaoka at the controls. The aircraft performed well during a 20-minute test flight, with the only concern being the length of the takeoff run. For the second test flight, four days later (four days prior to Japan&#x27;s declaration of surrender), rocket-assisted take-off (RATO) units were fitted to the aircraft. The pilot had been uneasy about the angle at which the rocket tubes had been set, but, with no time to correct them, they decided to simply reduce the thrust of the rockets from 800 kg to only 400 kg. Four seconds into take off the RATO was actuated, immediately jolting the aircraft back onto its tail leaving the pilot with no effective tail control. After the nine-second burning time of the RATO ran out, the nose came down and the nose wheel contacted the runway, resulting in a sudden deceleration, however, both engines were still functioning normally. At this point, the pilot opted to abort the take off but fighting to brake the aircraft and perform a ground loop only put him in danger of running it into other installations. Eventually, the aircraft ran over a drainage ditch, which caught the tricycle landing gear, and the aircraft continued to skid forward and stopped short of the water&#x27;s edge. Before it could be repaired, Japan had surrendered, and the War was over.

At this point, the second prototype was close to completion, and approximately twenty-three more airframes were under construction. Five of these were two-seat trainers.

===Postwar===

After the War, airframes 3, 4, and 5 (and possibly other partial airframes) were brought to the U.S. for study. Today, two examples survive in the National Air and Space Museum: The first is a &quot;Kikka&quot; that was taken to the Patuxent River Naval Air Base, Maryland for analysis. This aircraft is very incomplete and is believed to have been patched together from a variety of semi-completed airframes. It is currently still in storage at the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration and Storage Facility in Silver Hill, Maryland. The second &quot;Kikka&quot; is on display at the NASM Udvar-Hazy Center in the Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar. Correspondence in 2001 with Japanese propulsion specialist Kazuhiko Ishizawa theorized that Nakajima constructed the Museum’s &quot;Kikka&quot; airframe for load testing, not for flight tests. This may explain why the engine nacelles previously fitted on the Museum’s &quot;Kikka&quot; airframe are too small to enclose the Ne-20 engines. However, Ishizawa later stated that a limited survey at the Paul E. Garber facility concluded that this &quot;Kikka&quot; may not be a strength-tester due to the presence of wiring, hydraulics and controls. Furthermore, Susumu Watanabe, who was in charge of engine outfitting for the &quot;Kikka&quot;, recalled that the engine nacelles of the strength tester were the same as the standard aircraft, and that the strength tester was stressed until failure. Based on this information, the mock nacelles were potentially added for display purposes after transit to the United States.

Two Ne-20 jet engines had been taken to the US and sent for analysis to the Chrysler Corporation in 1946. This was only revealed in 2005 by W. I. Chapman, who was in charge of the project at the time. A working engine was assembled with the parts of the two Ne-20s, and tested for 11 hours and 46 minutes. A report was issued on 7 April 1947, titled &quot;Japanese NE-20 turbo jet engine. Construction and performance&quot;. The document is now on display at the Tokyo National Science Museum.

==Variants==
Nakajima Aircraft Company developed some variants of the aircraft:

Five of the planes under construction at the end of the War were to be completed as two-seat trainers. Other follow-on versions proposed included a reconnaissance aircraft and a fighter armed with two 30 mm Type 5 cannons with 50 rounds per gun. The fighter was expected to be powered by a more advanced development of the Ne-20, known as &quot;Ne-20 Kai&quot; 6.37 kN (650 kgf), which was planned to have approximately 30% more thrust than the Ne-20.

<text>HMAS &quot;Lithgow&quot; (J206/M206), named for the city of Lithgow, New South Wales, Australia was one of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes constructed during World War II, and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Lithgow&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Lithgow&quot; was laid down by Morts Dock &amp; Engineering Co at Mort&#x27;s Dock in Balmain, New South Wales on 19 August 1940. She was launched on 21 December 1940, and commissioned into the RAN on 14 June 1941.

==Operational history==
&quot;Lithgow&quot;, in company with , , and , sank the enemy Japanese submarine &quot;I-124&quot; off Darwin, the first enemy submarine sunk in Australian waters, on 20 January 1942.

In May 1943, &quot;Lithgow&quot; was one of several ships to search for survivors following the torpedoing of AHS &quot;Centaur&quot;, with no success.

The corvette received three battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Darwin 1942&quot;, &quot;Pacific 1941–45&quot;, and &quot;New Guinea 1942–44&quot;.

==Fate==
&quot;Lithgow&quot; paid off to reserve on 8 June 1948 and was sold for scrap to the Hong Kong Delta Shipping Company on 8 August 1956.
